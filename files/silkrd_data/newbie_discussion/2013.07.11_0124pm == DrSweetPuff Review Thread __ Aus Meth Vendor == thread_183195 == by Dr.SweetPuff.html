				pm sent, review to follow<br />[EDIT] Houston, the eagle has landed! Product has arrived to the west, sent express, taking the correct amount of days. Packaging is acceptable for a new vendor but will need improvement in order to maintain a 100 score. Printed receiving address. Upon inspection of the unopened letter no lumps/bumps/or smells&nbsp; detected, appearing to be genuine containing nothing but document. Once opened I removed the usual paper buffers to find a mylar vacuum bag protecting a small zip lock bag. Inside this zip lock is what appears to be 1 single large shard of HCL salt. <br /><br />I break the seal on the mylar bag and watch everything inside grow. The once perfectly formed shard has been cracked during transit and is now in 2 large pieces and some shatter. This Meth is being sold as 100mg and my initial impression is it looks low. I tare the gunpowder tray on my 000scales and pour the contents in to find 113mg with some dust remaining in the bag. The density of these crystals make eye-ball judgement hard.<br /><br />As a large male with insane tolerance to everything I have placed half a point onto some foil. (I live a destroy all evidence lifestyle) and put some heat underneath. A quick melt and a waft of the vapors tell me there is a small amount of Methylsulfonylmethane present. Inhaling the vapours on the second melt leave me pleasantly suprised, the expecting cold feeling at the back of the throat the msm produces was not present. Inhale, then exhale a large cloud also indication that the initial chop taste could be under 5% as most users know msm goes in the lung but doesn&#039;t come out. Subsequent vaporisation reveals the product to quite uniform in quality. When allowed to cool the ice reacts in a uniform way with no spots/dots/freckles icing before the rest. It starts to ice on one corner then cracks across cleanly, indicating minimal Isopropylbenzylamine. Another item to notice is the liquid remains a clear white with only the slightest amount of cream/yellow after too much heat is applied. Fast forward to the last toke and there is a slightly foul taste, but nothing like what is normally expected. Residue on the foil is a light coating of white with flecks of grey powder.<br /><br />I find the effects of this meth to be desirable. The standard user would find mind altering effects, such as euphoria, after vaporising 50mg. I also wish to note there is low body load associated with this batch indicating to me an effective blend of d-meth from short term euphoria and l-meth for legs. Judging by the effect vs usage ratio I would estimate around a 50%-r to 50%-s absolute configuration.<br /><br />In closing, I believe this vendor is already a valuable member to our local silk road scene. Just remember TRUST NO ONE and you will be here for the long run :) Thanks!<br /><br />TLDR:: If you are a meth connoisseur buy this meth, acetone wash and enjoy. Vendor is easy and honest to deal with. <br /><br />

				Hey doctor I&#039;m excited about doing business with you&nbsp; :) I&#039;m hoping to be your 1st customer id like to give you feedback so far about our business together. Your message to me on silk road me being user name Worldwideconsumer ( because I like to consume&nbsp; &nbsp;;D) you seem professional but you said my order would be sent out in the message yet my order isn&#039;t marked in transit. Minor error and if you could let us know your trading hours on your vendor profile that would be appreciated. If your product is as described and you keep processing times low id do business with you in the future :-) so I will be the first I won&#039;t be the last and I really hope this isn&#039;t a one off.I will give a comprehensive feedback review on the road and also here I hope I got samples in my 0.5 gram order. <br />Crictal illness needs quality meth oh and your name is awesome doctor I need a shot :-)

				Lets hope. Not enough reliable vendors domestically - we need the competition.<br />*I wish everyone could write their review without reading any others&#039; - that&#039;d be bloody interesting :)<br /><br /><br />Review Time!<br /><br />Ok, product arrived today.<br />First thought - HolySHIT, that&#039;s 1 mighty fine, perfectly cut lookin rock&nbsp; (def the most impressed I&#039;ve been at 1st look at least). She&#039;s beautiful, no itty bits, just 1 piece :) Stealth fine for domestic. No scales on hand atm....looks the shiz.<br />Gonna give it a day or 2 though, really need to freakin&#039; sleep tonight! <br />Will keep u all informed :)<br />TMKF<br /><br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Noticeably less body load (jitters/muscle tension/cardio etc) . Little to no scattering of thoughts. Perhaps not as strong or as clasically &#039;speedy&#039; as some would have mostly experienced but presents, smokes, tastes cleaner. Clean glass, no &#039;instant&#039; fogging, barely a ring/spot left, clear liquid, recrystallizing uniformly with very few, tiny cloudy spots. I have a low-med tolerance.<br />Printed label, stealth is satisfactory.<br /><br />The point is?&nbsp; (puns, anyone?)<br />High chance I will purchase from vendor if they can maintain some consistency. This gear is quite interesting and I&#039;d like to try again.<br /><br />* Late edit, sorry! - washing machine + usb +mediafuckingcunts = no TOR/SR + sad face&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( btw, why is there no &#039;therefore&#039; key? I say, dump the ! - slaughtered and overused due to sms and teen angst - and gimme my dotted triangle! )<br /><br /><br /><br />

				bought a p two days ago and it arrived this morning, just on weight which was a bit of a surprise due to new vendors usually over weighing a tad, but alas not under and it&#039;s some pretty primo gear, doesn&#039;t disappear straight away like some of the rock on the market and has some legs to it, definitely worth a try for the price guys. keep up the good work !

				Right, so the Dr. was nice enough to select me for a free sample, which I might add came overnight as promised :)<br />Me and a mate tucked into those shiny, generous chunks around 10pm.<br />It&#039;s now 5:30am and I aint sleeping tonight, so yeah, this shit is the goods.<br />Smoked up long and hard - dragon clouds all up in that bitch!<br />Puddle cracked back into crystal very nicely with a nice sweet taste.<br />Without just being an ass-kisser for the free sample, it really is some nice gear!<br />Only stuff I&#039;ve had better off the road was the rock I bought from Kush411... but there&#039;s no competing with that USA, Walter White freak meth&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />So yeah SweetPuff, you&#039;ve got yourself some shards to be proud of there!<br />Now excuse me while I go beat my dick like it owes me money&nbsp; ;D<br />&nbsp;

				Review:<br /><br />DrSweetPff sent me a sample, 1p which weighed over slightly. arrived with adequate stealth for domestic purposes and overnight. Was probably 1 shard when sent but I guess my local postie was not aware of the precious cargo he carried it arrived in about three rocks, quite clear in colour. Now I will remain as objective as possible but the only thing better then high quality drugs is free high quality drugs, obviously the Dr is confident of of his product otherwise he wouldn&#039;t be sending out samples. And he should be confident, the p smoked as well as anything I have purchased on the road before, I say I got about 12-15 long burns from the point. Good taste and was clear and clean right to the end, left a tiny bit of residue and mark on the inside of the pipe but hardly noticeable. I have used Sydeny&#039;s finest, AUSexpress and the Ministry of Shard and the Dr&#039;s gear is easily on the same level if not better. For the price it can&#039;t be beat. Overall I would give it and 8 out of ten (not sure if I have had a 10). Lastly I would like to thank the Dr for this opportunity, will no doubt be using you for prescriptions in the future.<br /><br />Additional info, I am male approx 75kg and have been dabbling relationally with the pipe for around 15 years, would have say a medium tolerance.

				Well might i just say that he sent the sample express which was another great gesture from the vendor. I wont get carried away with describing how it looked but to say the shards were long crystals which were a tinge white. The important thing is that after i IV&#039;d the sample i definately felt the beautiful warm rush and a slight little cough... Not much more you can ask for out of a point of gear really, The only bad point was that had to wait a couple days before i could a have it&nbsp; I will be placing an order soon champ, as soon as i get rid of what i got....<br />.<br /><br />Oh and stealth was as good as any i&#039;ve seen from an Australian vendor.<br /><br />Sorry for taking so long to write this Ibut i&#039;m guessing that all the school kids are trying to buy thier pot is the reason i cant log onto the road lateley because of the fuckwits in the Australian media? If they were that concerned why would they advertise it so much?

				well blow me down... I have an outstanding order with this vendor and after reading these reviews, I gotta say I&#039;m eagre to try it... <br /><br />What do you look for in &#039;quality&#039; gear? I only take it orally, not vape or snort or whatever (seems safer) so I have no idea what to look for, except for reviews from experts like you all here..&nbsp; So thanks for that..<br /><br />By the sounds of it, this vendor&#039;s worth waiting for..<br /><br />What effects do you look out for to know it&#039;s high quality?

				I too have had the good fortune to enjoy the opportunity of sampling this new Vendors wares, and I thank him both for the chance<br />and his patience in awaiting my review here (I was becoming a bit anxious since I turned out not to be able to do it for the first few days, but he&#039;s been cooler than I, not even a message about it thus far). Let me first say I am by no means a meth head or connoisseur,<br />so while stimulants are easily my drug of choice I tend to gravitate towards pharms like dexies or very pure amp sulphate powder in<br />order to keep it clean and avoid most of the neurotoxicity while having a very good idea of the product I&#039;m using. From time to time<br />though, I might lash out and enjoy a point or two every now and then, and so have previously sampled Ausexpress, Aussiegear, Reich,<br />and a few others over the last 8 months or so, with tucksh0p early last week being the latest. With this background, and my usual <br />preferred ROA being oral and snorted, I wasn&#039;t quite prepared for what the doctor sent me.<br /><br />Having that background, I had never really bought into the hype or fascination most users had with &#039;shards&#039;, so while I understood for a lot of people it was a means of visually gauging and getting a less cut product and hopefully a more expert synthesis, I still didn&#039;t get the fetishisation which often comes with it. Then I opened the express bag, and unpacked this beauty:<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=4jr.jpg<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry my equipment can&#039;t do it justice, but I finally &#039;got&#039; some of the appeal; a single .80 rock of such translucence it felt somehow wrong to be breaking or using it, that it more properly deserved to be expertly cut and set into a gold ring.<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=4zo.jpg<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=4zn.jpg<br /><br />I also felt that in order to make a competent review I&#039;d need to get new, proper glassware, and I also wanted to obtain a suitable reagent test kit which would give some indication of purity. I&#039;ve had to abandon the latter, but i did find some good new gear at least. <br /><br />Having made adequate preparation today, with a good workout the night before and pre-supplementing, I could begin.<br /><br />t:00 30mg oral&nbsp; 6:50<br />7:00 dinner, nice and healthy, before it gets hard to eat but the oral chunk is absorbed quickly on the empty stomach - <br />7:16 - starting to really feel the initial dose, slight body load, light tremors (anticipatory? ^^)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; crisp frosted edge in the head, just a tiny hint. <br />7:25 head coming on to rise above the experience, really nice progressive come up so far<br />This suggests that this is as desired, predominantly or exclusively D isomer, with the better feeling<br />and less cardiotoxic, potentially unpleasant body load of levoamphetamine.<br /><br />7:35 Guessing the first plateau is close to reached, time to really let it take off<br /><br />Hit the 50mg rock over about 5 minutes, the initial meltdown and pool was very uniform, quick and consistent,<br />a clean break up and spread throughout; the recrystalization was also rapid and uniform, having just<br />a couple of cloudier patches as you would expect. This took place at least 3 more times, remaining<br />consistent, with some minor variation in the placement and size of the cloudier bits. <br /><br />The smoke was incredibly smooth, being almost tasteless to begin with, and even with thoroughly clean glasswear with <br />controlled blue zipperlight applied it was usually impossible for me to tell when and how much smoke was<br />coming off by pure sight alone, I could only try to inhale consistently and enjoy the surprise of just how much thick white<br />vapour would come out on the exhale; These big puffs had enough to tell that this was definately a chem,<br />and speed, but still it was pleasingly subtle and not in the least noxious or overwhelming. I&#039;d like to<br />believe the subtle smoke and taste are signs of clean synthesis and purity but I&#039;ll let you be the judge <br />of that. In terms of residue and aftermath the pipe is almost totally clean again, with one small brown <br />spot and its smoked outline, an impressive result for the volume and number of passes I made. <br /><br />As far as feeling goes, its simply carried on where the first part left off; a little more tickling of <br />the neurons but crucially still maintaining a quintessentially clean presence throughout; I don&#039;t feel<br />intoxicated, my thoughts aren&#039;t much tainted or impaired, and the side effect profile so far is benign.<br /><br />1.5 hours later it has reached a slightly higher level and plateaued consistently. very enjoyable!<br /><br />I&#039;ll hopefully come back later to speak of longevity, comedown and so on but so far so good.<br /><br />Cheers, Herr Doktor!

I&#039;ve had to abandon the latter, but i did find some good new gear at least. <br /><br />Having made adequate preparation today, with a good workout the night before and pre-supplementing, I could begin.<br /><br />t:00 30mg oral&nbsp; 6:50<br />7:00 dinner, nice and healthy, before it gets hard to eat but the oral chunk is absorbed quickly on the empty stomach - <br />7:16 - starting to really feel the initial dose, slight body load, light tremors (anticipatory? ^^)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; crisp frosted edge in the head, just a tiny hint. <br />7:25 head coming on to rise above the experience, really nice progressive come up so far<br />This suggests that this is as desired, predominantly or exclusively D isomer, with the better feeling<br />and less cardiotoxic, potentially unpleasant body load of levoamphetamine.<br /><br />7:35 Guessing the first plateau is close to reached, time to really let it take off<br /><br />Hit the 50mg rock over about 5 minutes, the initial meltdown and pool was very uniform, quick and consistent,<br />a clean break up and spread throughout; the recrystalization was also rapid and uniform, having just<br />a couple of cloudier patches as you would expect. This took place at least 3 more times, remaining<br />consistent, with some minor variation in the placement and size of the cloudier bits. <br /><br />The smoke was incredibly smooth, being almost tasteless to begin with, and even with thoroughly clean glasswear with <br />controlled blue zipperlight applied it was usually impossible for me to tell when and how much smoke was<br />coming off by pure sight alone, I could only try to inhale consistently and enjoy the surprise of just how much thick white<br />vapour would come out on the exhale; These big puffs had enough to tell that this was definately a chem,<br />and speed, but still it was pleasingly subtle and not in the least noxious or overwhelming. I&#039;d like to<br />believe the subtle smoke and taste are signs of clean synthesis and purity but I&#039;ll let you be the judge <br />of that. In terms of residue and aftermath the pipe is almost totally clean again, with one small brown <br />spot and its smoked outline, an impressive result for the volume and number of passes I made. <br /><br />As far as feeling goes, its simply carried on where the first part left off; a little more tickling of <br />the neurons but crucially still maintaining a quintessentially clean presence throughout; I don&#039;t feel<br />intoxicated, my thoughts aren&#039;t much tainted or impaired, and the side effect profile so far is benign.<br /><br />1.5 hours later it has reached a slightly higher level and plateaued consistently. very enjoyable!<br /><br />I&#039;ll hopefully come back later to speak of longevity, comedown and so on but so far so good.<br /><br />Cheers, Herr Doktor!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 karma for such a detailed review.

				Hey guys, really pleased with all the feedback so far, so glad you&#039;ve all enjoyed our product and really thankful for all the detailed reviews! Just letting you know in the near future we will be offering bulk amounts of ecstasy tablets in the near future. Just currently working out the kinks with our product but we will be offering 2 types; MDxx based pills and speed based pills in lots of 50 or more and very reasonable prices.

				I am very interested in buying given the feedback. I bear in mind however that a new vendor offering 10 free samples for review would have to be exceptionally dumb not to provide the best possible product..

				Tried my batch this week - oral use so mixed with water and seemed to do the trick.&nbsp; Tried 1/6th first day and 1/3rd the next day, seemed totally fine.&nbsp; Seemed like a nice sized package too, and from what I know, looked like quality stuff.<br /><br />Delivery was a bit slow and communication a little hap hazard but the vendor deserves a chance while they set up.&nbsp; Vendor was very apologetic and amply compensated.&nbsp; Certainly seemed worth waiting for anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely return.<br /><br />Seems others here are also happy with the vendor&#039;s product.&nbsp; I purchased based on this thread in fact.

				So far, I&#039;m not super impressed with this vendor.<br /><br />I placed an order on Thursday and it&#039;s 12.45pm Tuesday and I&#039;m still yet to receive my stuff. It was only marked in transit yesterday. <br /><br />I&#039;ve sent the vendor a couple of PM&#039;s that were ignored.<br /><br />Very unsatisfied by the customer service. I need this point to keep going today so I&#039;ll be quite upset if it doesn&#039;t arrive today.<br /><br />I&#039;ve PM&#039;d the vendor asking for the tracking number but I doubt I&#039;ll get a reply.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll update this once I EVENTUALLY receive and try out the gear.

				An update.<br /><br />It took 6 days to arrive. The stuff was 20% underweight. The vendor offered a 50mg re-ship which he never ended up sending. However he cancelled my order as I had yet to finalize and I got my money back. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad I received my money back without going to resolution and potentially ruining my stats but overall I&#039;m not impressed with this vendor, even if the gear was good.
