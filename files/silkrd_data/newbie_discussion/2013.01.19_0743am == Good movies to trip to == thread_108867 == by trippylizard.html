				Life of Pi,&nbsp; &nbsp;about the dude, in the boat, with the tiger.<br />I have never tripped but I imagine the matrix would be cool.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or dumb and dumber.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Traded the kid back in town for the van straight up.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				I find movies and TV in general a bit of a buzz kill when I&#039;m tripping. Would much rather listen to some tunes.<br />Unless you find trippy shit to watch you will probably end up bored of the movie corporations attempts to entertain you. regardless of cgi, that shit is only impressive on a superficial level.

				Life of Pi would be pretty visually stunning and intense. There are always the old standbys: Any graphic novel adaptation. Watchmen, Sin City, 300, Immortals. Across the Universe. Any Discovery/Nat Geo documentary in HD. <br /><br />The Hobbit in 3D would something I&#039;d want to drop at<br /><br />TOPS: I&#039;d say the IMAX 3D Cirque du Soleil or Terry Gilliam movies.

				My first trip started while watching Limitless. I convinced myself LSD had horrible unknown side effects and I was going to be a strung out addict. Once the rationality overcame the paranoia (only 1 tab) I was fine.

				Agree with nmnmnm, TV appears as what it is, a muddy drain, on a good trip. But Barbarella is hard to beat for old-skool weirdness. The Wicker Man (original, not remake) too...no good for nervous types tho.

				The very first time I tried acid, I was jamming on some music at a friend&#039;s place.&nbsp; I had no idea how long an acid trip would take to kick in, nor how long it&#039;d last for.&nbsp; The end result was that when it came time to go back home I was still tripping my face off.&nbsp; I was only 19 and lived with my parents still.. and I was pretty keen not to hang around them too much, as I was paranoid that it&#039;d be completely fkn obvious that I was tripping if I said two words.&nbsp; So I went straight to my room and turned on the TV and saw a film called &quot;Breaking The Rules&quot;.. and it was the BEST thing I&#039;d ever seen.&nbsp; Fucking insane.. intense.. hilarious.. clever.. beautifully shot.. just perfect.&nbsp; Of course at some point I had to go to the toilet.. on my way back I got distracted by the newspaper or something and totally forgot about the film.<br /><br />but then the next day, totally overcome by how awesome my whole afternoon/evening had been.. and going through my day&#039;s obligations in a total daze.. I was still overwhelmed with what an awesome movie I&#039;d seen.&nbsp; And I was annoyed that I&#039;d missed half of it.&nbsp; So that evening, on my way home, I went and hired it on VHS.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t wait another day to see it.&nbsp; Turns out the film was a pile of rubbish.<br /><br />this whole story is really just an exercise in wasting all your time of course.. I could have just said that if you&#039;re tripping hard enough and you have a good mindset about it, pretty much ANYTHING can seem amazing.<br /><br />On a slightly diff note, whenever I&#039;m around anyone else who&#039;s tripping super hard I always like to put on some ZZ Top vids - either something from Live In Texas, or any of the MTV era clips.&nbsp; It always gets to people.. partly because they&#039;re never expecting it.. partly because the visuals are so tripper-friendly.. partly because the music is just that little bit warped and off-beat.

				I loved that Tenacious D movie,with the devil&#039;s guitar pick?<br />As lsd heightens your emotions i got really into the whole quest .<br />The ben stiller cameo was ÜBERconvincing as i could SOMEwhat recognize him but at the same time he truelly became the creepy guy he portayed so i was still questioning it.<br />Then i watched it again sober..it was ..meh yet i remembered the way i watched it on acid so till this day i find it a great movie haha.<br /><br />I do not advice movies that make you go..&quot;LOOK BEHIND YOU IDIOT&quot; or &quot;aaaw men,that was sooooo dumb ,you should not have done that&quot; at the characters all the time.<br />But that is just me,like i said ,watching movies on acid makes me really invested in the scenes and like exponantially multiplies what i&#039;m feeling.<br />If the scene wants to portray ominous i&#039;ll go with it but if i get irritated due to an incredibly dumb character i&#039;ll be over the top irritated.But that&#039;s just because sometimes don&#039;t tolerate stupidity :).<br />(I tend to find myself extremely smart on acid.<br />For those that know of the super-focussed state people with ADHD can be in,that&#039;s how i get in my head thus probably the reason i feel that way:D)<br /><br />Anything with great visuals and unusual stuff will do.<br />

				The Fountain has been mentioned here a few times. That&#039;s trippy enough on it&#039;s own, but will really fuck you up in a good way while medicated.<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream, done by the same guy, is also awesome. But it&#039;s depressing as shit. The ultimate anti-heroin movie lol<br /><br />Sucker Punch is awesome. That hasn&#039;t been mentioned yet, but it&#039;s one of the most cinematic movies ever. Only came out a couple of years ago too.

				Slightly off topic, since I wasn&#039;t tripping while watching The Aristocrats, but seeing that really stoned is definitely a trip.&nbsp; I found it somewhere between hilarious and totally revolting (sometimes both)!
