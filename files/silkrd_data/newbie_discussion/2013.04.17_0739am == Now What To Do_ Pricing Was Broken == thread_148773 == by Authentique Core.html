				Hey guys.<br />About a week ago I went wild and placed orders for two vials of acid.<br />The inspiration for this was because, as I have not logged into SR for perhaps a few months, I logged in to see absolutely phenomenal prices on LSD, from a phenomenal seller (to be unnamed here).<br /><br />I placed this order and did not log in until just now. I assumed (being a naive, uninformed, opportunistic newb) that somehow I sat on my bitcoins in SR long enough (months) that Bitcoins increased in value, to the point that they became worth $120 each! I didn&#039;t do the math but said, &quot;Hell yeah!&quot;<br /><br />So I placed the order for these vials at that ridiculously listed price, as well as some smaller orders.<br /><br />I logged in tonight and found message waiting for me, from that vendor.<br /><br />It reads in verbatim:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">URGENT PLEASE DO NOT FINALISE<br /><br />Tl;Dr<br /><br />SR pricing is broken, so orders finalised do not give us the real value of the products, please wait to finalise.<br /><br />***If you have an order with us that has arrived please do not finalize until SR has fixed it&#039;s pricing system.<br /><br />We have taken our listings offline until this is fixed.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;&lt;SERVICE OUTAGE&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />Hello all, in the last 24 hours we had a lot of orders finalised.<br /><br />Given the pricing system was broken we are down about 15k USD.<br /><br />Please do not finalise until the markets have stabalised somewhat.<br /><br />We are waiting to hear back from SR/Vendor Support to hear if they have an plan of action regarding the above.<br /><br />We&#039;d appreciate if anyone concerned could send a note to SR admins to ask what they are doing about this.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />(Then it goes on...)<br /><br />Hello all, we have decided to put our listings in vacation mode until we understand the ramifications of this:<br /><br />notice an increase in orders today? in short:<br /><br />sr pricing system broken, pricing everything assuming 1btc = $120....howeveeeer this is based on the mtgox rate which has been frozen for the past few hours because of the bubble pop yesterday. people are exploiting this pricing error by by purchasing btc on the other exchanges at a rate of 1btc = $50-68<br /><br />There is a good chance given that the pricing system is broken that you may not receive the right amount when the customer finalize and by then it is too late<br /><br />I know I sound like a snitch but I was about to place an order with someone and then noticed the error and didn&#039;t go through with the order because I don&#039;t want to exacerbate the problems for vendors given yesterdays crash. Other people may not feel the same way I do and are knowingly trying to exploit/defraud vendors<br /><br />pass this on to whoever you feel may need to be warned</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m posting this for some interpretation and guidance. <br />My bitcoins went to the vendor and the orders are &quot;processing&quot;.<br />There&#039;s a part of me (the bone-tight spendthrift part) that wants to see these orders go through at the prices&nbsp; they were listed as, whatever the reason. I didn&#039;t believe i was taking advantage of the vendor when placing the order, as all prices were down, and I wasn&#039;t keeping up to date on what was happening.<br /><br />However, this is a very good vendor, who has very good lsd, and (from dealings in the past), I want to keep on good terms with them. I want to see them thrive, because I want that connection to be there!<br /><br />How to proceed? Any advice for this bony, spendthrift newb?<br /><br />And ps! On these orders for vials I intentionally, ever-so-slightly, misspelled my name in the address. The next day I felt so stupid about doing that, even if the misspell was so slight, that I wrote the vendor and asked them to change my name to what it is really. So besides the above quoted response, the vendor has also wrote me back if I would like to cancel the orders and &quot;do it again&quot;.<br /><br />What do you think, experienced users? Again I hope my unthinking newbness isn&#039;t too offensive here. But this is the problem as it seems to be, unless I&#039;m missing something...

				The vendor doesn&#039;t want to take the hit from the bitcoin decline! When i saw the value of the bitcoin drop so much i suspected that there would be vendors that wouldn&#039;t process order because of the money they would lose.
