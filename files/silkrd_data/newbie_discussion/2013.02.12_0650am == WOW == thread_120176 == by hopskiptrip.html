				So I have been a member for one month and I was checking out my account to just look. Well I have spent à¸¿14.64 to date with 59 transactions. I did not realize I had spent so much, with btc at $24 thats $351.50 crazy. I have yet to even buy a drug. I have gotten some movies, shows, software and the best purchase so far is purplelotuses coupons I have saved hundreds. Anyway I know the $ amount is off just because btc going up in cost the last week or so but still WOW. Now if I could just spam to get my 50 here that would be great. I guess that is why I am posting this crap. I also think I should be good with sellers now that I have my purchases up?? Even if 40 of them are lotto ones right?? I just do not want my first inter web drug buy to be a scam. <br />So what are your newbie stats at? Also if a veteran or seller thinks it was a good idea buying other none drug things a good choice.

				Holy shit 2000 how long have you been here? Fuck WOW to that. I know most are good but you read so many posts about even trusted sellers supposedly screwing new people. I am just trying to go by the guide got me some buys you know doing my thing. You on the other hand I am amazed still 2000 dam thats a fucking new car and a nice one at that. I am hoping btc keeps falling so I can get some more then they can go back up so I can buy more shit :)

				Be careful -- there was a glitch tonight with deposits multiplying every 10 minutes ... so some of the orders you received tonight right before the site went down were orders made with &quot;fake&quot; bitcoins.&nbsp; That&#039;s why DPR is advising vendors NOT to send any orders out until the site is back up.

You the masses having it happen were buying shit like crazy or withdrawing it. It was probably like the people who pull over on a highway to grab as much cash from a wrecked money truck. We are all &quot;criminals&quot; here so you know it would feel like hitting a lottery. I read some had a couple thousand by the time it got stopped and shut down.
