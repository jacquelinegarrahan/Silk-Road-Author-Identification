				Our communication was good.&nbsp; I finalized early since I&#039;m new and they are a reputable vendor.&nbsp; It took 6 days for the package to get here.&nbsp; I was expecting sooner, but I have no complaints.&nbsp; The packaging was excellent and I destroyed it soon after opening it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall it was an excellent first experience and I plan to share these.<br />

				I also finalized early for a reputable vendor. The package arived the same week it was ordered. I was impressed by the quality and shipping stealth. MiMM has to be one of the best vendors on SR for new buyers. My only complaint is a clonazepam that was sent regular mail that has not showed up, but I guess these things happen.

				My first orders were nearly a year ago. I just don&#039;t post on the forums much. Kind of annoying this new 50 post rule.<br /><br />My first order was with a very reputable seller and went smoothly with good communication. Took a while to get to me and I&#039;ll admit I was worried after more than a week. I wrote that money off as a loss, and then it showed up in the post. You can&#039;t believe how happy that made me. :)

				I ordered from Lloydsbrothers who didnt require FE. Order arrived the next day, vac&#039;d and stealthily packed. Happy bunny was I. SInce then I tried Sonicdrone and&nbsp; Budworkx, had to FE to get what I wanted. Orders both arrived as well. All good.<br />I guess you&#039;re going to get scammed at some point though unless you really research your vendors.

				First two experiences were great, vendors AnselAdams and div. Currently awaiting my third order, which is slightly larger, so slightly more nerve-wracking. <br />Research is key.

				My first was with my favorite vender, MushMouth.&nbsp; He is the reason I&#039;m trying to get&nbsp; posts at all, because he&#039;s great and I want to be able to give him his proper reviews.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d written to ask if it was okay to purchase, since I was brand new to the site.&nbsp; He said it was fine and I ordered.&nbsp; It took about a week to get to me and it was excellent product.&nbsp; He&#039;s the guy I always prefer to go to, and he recently gave me an amazing custom order since I had someone coming into town next week.&nbsp; <br /><br />All of my transactions so far have gone well.&nbsp; I always thoroughly research the vender before I order anything, and usually write them before or after I&#039;ve purchased.&nbsp; I always have good communication in return. <br />

				For my first order, I ordered 3 different items, all ordered this Sunday.<br /><br />The first item was 1 gram of dutch MDMA from MaidMandy, an Ireland based vendor. She was rather quick to get it in transit, and I&#039;m absolutely psyched in anticipation of its arrival.<br /><br />The second item was a 10 strip of LSD from Lucydrop. Unfortunately, they require FE, but due to their track record I didn&#039;t let that stop me. However, I still have not been given the chance to FE and it&#039;s been over 48 hours and I&#039;m curious as to why, considering I sent them a message and they have been on processing orders. Maybe I&#039;m just impatient and I&#039;m in a long line for processing.&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />The third item was an MDMA 205mg pill from Emonkey, a new product of his called a &quot;console&quot; (has the word Nintendo printed on it). This was actually a free sample! Since Emonkey is based in the Netherlands, I&#039;m a little scared his package will be seized and my address flagged before I even get into the game. However, I have faith he will pull through with his packaging :)<br /><br />As I&#039;m sure you can all tell, I&#039;m fucking eager as hell to sample my packages.

				My first couple of experiences weren&#039;t so good, I didn&#039;t research the vendors thoroughly and I was a victim of selective scammers. Now that I&#039;ve been on SR for a year I&#039;ve learned that researching the vendor thoroughly is essential before making a purchase, and because of that I&#039;ve had no issues since my first couple of purchases.&nbsp; So, moral of the story is, always RESEARCH and don&#039;t just rely on the reviews on the vendor&#039;s page as they can be faked.

				&nbsp;I am hopeful.<br />Placed my first 2 orders ~24 hrs ago.&nbsp; <br />Both are still processing, no msgs. or confirmation.<br />the anticipation is kind of fun, but I would not mind seeing them switch over to in transit now.

				my first purchase was smooth as... silk? I did my homework. Found top vendors that did not demand that I finalize early ( I won&#039;t do that). And I also read their product reviews. All top notch. <br /><br />I went first with hypnotiquestatez77. He had the order out the same day and it arrived the next. It was so well hidden, I almost through it away. It was great. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t really feel like a total noob because I had done a good deal of homework first, and had totally untraceable coins to spend. I&#039;m loving it.
