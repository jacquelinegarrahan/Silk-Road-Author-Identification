				Ok so was interested in trying DMT, my friend said he could get some.&nbsp; He got a 1G vial that according to the guy he got it from it&#039;s DMT deposited on an herb of some sort (I forget what it was called).&nbsp; This was a while ago.&nbsp; I now know from the road what DMT looks like and that what I got MIGHT have been changa.&nbsp; I&#039;m suspicious that it could have been Salvia or something else.<br /><br />The material is definitely plant based and similar in size&nbsp; to oregano maybe a little smaller but almost pure black and oily looking like it&#039;s had a lot of something dark deposited on it.&nbsp; It smells kinda like nail polish and artificial fruit flavor, but not quite as bad as that sounds.<br /><br />I burned a small amount like a pinch of the stuff with a direct lighter flame using a carb and it blew me out of the universe.&nbsp; I forgot who and what I was or anything I was in the void.&nbsp; All the objects in the room were 2 dimensional and laid together like a ream of paper.&nbsp; I was one of the &quot;papers&quot; and the whole thing was moving forward like a slow river.&nbsp; There was some more uncomfortable visuals and the first bit of reality that materialized was my friends face.&nbsp; Once it was fully formed I figured out who he was and then realization of what just happened and WTF was going on.&nbsp; The whole room was still tearing like an oil painting on high speed.&nbsp; I felt this strong impulse to lean forward/throw my legs up (I was sitting in a chair).&nbsp; I laughed because I knew how ridiculous it was but gave in and did it anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />The visuals faded pretty quickly at that point and the whole thing lasted less than 10 minutes.&nbsp; It was fairly uncomfortable and certainly didn&#039;t leave me begging for more.&nbsp; Very intense.&nbsp; <br /><br />My wife tried it and enjoyed it quite a bit, she says all the objects were coming apart like decks of cards.&nbsp; I have at least one dose left that he left me but I want to try salvia for comparison before I try it again.&nbsp; I would try DMT as well but don&#039;t have the cohones to order some at this time.

				sounds like salvia to me, my most memorable experience on the shit (smelled like goose shit) was sitting on a couch and having the same feeling of motion, i felt as if the entire world were shifting to the left faster and faster until i leaned too far over and rolled to my side, when i sat up everything was back to normal - 5 minutes at most
