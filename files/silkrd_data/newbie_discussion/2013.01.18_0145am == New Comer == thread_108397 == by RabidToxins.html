				Hey all I go by my handle Rabid. No shit, I&#039;m new to this. So where is my warm welcome? I thought so. I&#039;m looking for a more local buyer instead of getting things shipped to me. If anyone can point me in the right direction that would be great! I live in Upstate NY and not willing to travel more than 45-60mins out of my way for it. <br /><br />
