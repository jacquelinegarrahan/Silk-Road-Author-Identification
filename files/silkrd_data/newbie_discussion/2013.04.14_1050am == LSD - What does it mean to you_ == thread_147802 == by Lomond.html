				Ok, I may be posting this in the wrong forum, but I&#039;m hoping there are many experienced people like myself who read the Newbie posts. Also, I refuse to post shit to get to fifty posts, so lets see how this goes. <br /><br />I have been studying the effects of psychedelic drugs for sometime now, reading some very interesting books and papers concerning different uses and aspects of the psychedelic experience. <br />I visit many sites on a regular basis, such as MAPS, Erowid and Heffter, and learn a great deal from them. <br />What I am hoping to learn from this thread is, why do people take Lsd today?<br />Are you looking to simply get off your tits<br />Are you looking for inspiration<br />Is it to escape reality<br />Are you hoping for a spiritual awakening<br />Are you looking to resolve personal issues<br />Are you using as part of psychotherapy (I would especially like to hear from anyone in this category)<br /><br />I started taking Lsd around 19 years ago, not knowing its full potential, I used it specifically to get off my tits (and loved every minute of it). After a break of around 10 years, I started reading a great deal on the subject. I now have a lot more respect for it, and pay a lot of attention to set and setting. I&#039;m still not sure what I&#039;m hoping to achieve from my sessions, I&#039;ll just see what they throw at me. <br /><br />If anyone has ever read something which has completely changed your perspective, or for that matter, had an experience that changed your life, I would love to hear about it. <br />Please include any titles and authors which you think could be usefull to new and experienced users alike <br /><br />Many thanks. <br /><br />Peace. <br />

				I read the &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test - Tom Wolfe&quot; several times as a teen in the late 70&#039;s. It really made me want to experiment with LSD. But I didn&#039;t feel at the time that real LSD was available on the streets. I think it was all some form of hallucinogenic amphetamine of some sort. I tried that quite a few times, and mushrooms many times.<br /><br />So although I&#039;ve done hallucinogens, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve ever done REAL LSD. Do you feel that the real thing is actually available today? I&#039;m honestly a little skeptical, but I would consider trying it.<br /><br />

				@ilovelucyshow It is a very good book, it sometimes makes me wish that I was born 30 years earlier. Did you ever see The Magic Trip movie? It would have been awesome to be on that bus. <br />Peace.
