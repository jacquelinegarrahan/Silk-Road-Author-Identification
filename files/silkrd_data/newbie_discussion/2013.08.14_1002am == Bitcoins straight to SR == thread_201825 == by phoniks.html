				If i&#039;m a small, irregular buyer and i am basically just buying bitcoins that i immediately spend, is it worth me using a wallet like electrum or is it fine for me to just send them straight from localbitcoins, for example, to SR and rely on the SR mixer to provide some extra anonymity?

				It would be okay to send them straight to SR from local bitcoins however there are other safer options out there. The only way I could see it becoming a problem is if either you are under investigation already or you are moving large sums of btc. That said it&#039;s your call. Best of luck to you.

				From what i have read sending the coins from the exchange to your wallet and then onto SR doesn&#039;t help much at all.<br /><br />The bitcoin ledger shows the trail anyway so you are just adding an extra step (with a cost) to it.&nbsp; Unless you mix the coins yourself some how.<br /><br />every time you buy coins to spend here, get a new deposit address and send them from the exchange to SR.&nbsp; it saves you a transaction fee and time :)<br /><br />If you are only buying a little bit of weed then your not really a high priority for LE.&nbsp; If you are something in buying bulk, then ignore me :)<br /><br />I may be wrong, but that&#039;s how i see it.

				Personally I would not send them straight to sr but yeah if they want to trace btc back to you btc leaves a trail and they will.&nbsp; Small aounts are probably ok.

				If you are interested and willing to try out a new Bitcoin vendor I am providing an very favorable deal right now. I am currently offering to sell bitcoins for Western Union deposits. I am only starting out so I am offering incentive to ensure your safety in the transaction. <br /><br />Offering Bitcoin at the favorable rate of $110/1 and a free 15% bonus to cover the western union fee plus a little extra. <br /><br />I would be willing to offer this deal on 5 transactions. That way you never have more than $55 at risk at any one time. You gain a little free money on every transaction and you get the chance to verify that I am providing honest service. <br /><br />Bitcoin will be deposited directly into your SR account and you wont have to worry about any kind of fees or anything being linked to your SR account.<br /><br />Message me on the main site or buy my free listing if you are interested.

				I&#039;d rather use different wallets to tumble those coins like some people here advised me. Better be safe than sorry, you know.

				I used to send from the exchange to my local wallet and then from wallet to SR but that could take up to four hours and usually I am in a hurry so for small amounts I send direct.

				I did a couple of times. Since I&#039;m small scale I didn&#039;t think there would be a problem. I used Bitcoin Fog last time, it worked fine, cost me 2.5 %, and took 6 hours split into two transactions.

				Nobody really knows for sure how the bitcoin tumbler works except for DPR and maybe someone close to him.&nbsp; With that being said I have full faith in the tumbler and think it&#039;s pretty damn good.&nbsp; I think they create new bitcoin addresses every time and the bitcoins that show up in your account are just digitally assigned to your account through some sort of complex programming.&nbsp; Then when you purchase something those bitcoins are deducted from your balance and added to the other vendors balance.&nbsp; But I&#039;m pretty sure there isn&#039;t a bitcoin wallet to bitcoin wallet transfer for that purchase like there would be if you send a friend some bitcoins from your wallet to theirs outside of SR.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I&#039;ve gathered from reading about it.&nbsp;
