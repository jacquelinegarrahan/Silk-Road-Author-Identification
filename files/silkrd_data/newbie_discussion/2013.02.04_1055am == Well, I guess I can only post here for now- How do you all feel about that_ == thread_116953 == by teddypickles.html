				I literally only use the forum to look in the rumor mill, ask questions about purchases, or post reviews on purchases.<br /><br />Using the forums that way, I have not earned that many posts.&nbsp; I also didn&#039;t see any messages that would have alerted me to the new post restriction because of that.&nbsp; It&#039;s annoying because I&#039;ve been trying to figure out how my browser broke, and ended up going to reddit to find out (yeah, that&#039;s me).&nbsp; <br /><br />I think that whatever they were trying to solve, they could have solved with less than a 50-post limit, which would have still weeded out the ones it could do that to, yet not bother any of the &quot;newbies&quot; that are just lurkers.&nbsp; <br /><br />however, complaining won&#039;t do anything, so here goes a bunch of spam so I can finally leave the stellar reviews for my shroom guy that he deserves.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				I can see the reason, but as it stands there are some unintended consequences...<br /><br />Previously the number of posts was a somewhat useful metric for how new a person was to the forum. Now new people feel obliged to quickly spam 50 messages, which means that having 50 posts doesn&#039;t really mean anything. A person with 50 posts is now just as likely to be a new person who has spammed &quot;hello&quot; 50 times.<br /><br />Another unintended consequence is that this encourages new people to write anything on any topic, even when they have nothing to say. Not sure if that will improve the quality of conversation in the long run.

				It does people more aware of their accounts though, but ofcourse it also get people spamming, could have(lets say 30 posts) but more strict rules about spamming to get there, if you spam to much you get a penalty of 30 more, or a week, something.. <br /><br />1 post less :)

				I find this ridiculous, this &quot;restriction&quot; should have been thoroughly thought out before being rolled out and nullified for vendors or something. I am a vendor on The Road and just came out of a long vacation and can&#039;t even let members know I am back. This is very bad for business and defiantly needs to be looked over, I messaged admins but with there 100+ messages a day I highly doubt they are even going to look over my message. However IF BY ANY CHANCE ANY MODS OR ADMINS ARE READING THIS PLEASE PASS DOWN THE LINE TO FIX THIS ISSUE FOR VENDORS. We pay our tax&#039;s for a reason.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Lexq

				On one hand, I find it kind of silly, considering the legwork required to even get here in the first place, register for accounts, set up bitcoins, etc etc etc etc... but on the other hand, I&#039;m sure plenty of us are familiar with John Gabriel&#039;s &quot;Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory&quot; (Anonymity + Keyboard + Audience = &quot;SHITCOCK!&quot;). So, hopefully this is a way for people to A: get cred, B: get acquainted with other new arrivals, and C: get anything ridiculous out of their system, and D: ensure that you actually intend to be here, and intend to post here in a meaningful manner?

But, I honestly feel that torbrowser is bad business. I went and downloaded Liberte, I put it on a flash drive. I followed the instructions to a T. It is a little slower, however. I feel much better using it. I hear Tailz is good too use as well, I do not know. I did not research it. I know that I boot up from my flash drive. And, if you do not know how to do that. You should prob back off until you do. First step is learning how to do this correctly, and that takes a little nerdy shit. That torbrowser is convienent, but, Yeah. Things at conveintent stores are expensive for a reason. Because you pay for that convienence. That&#039;s what happens when you use that shit on windows. It&#039;s wideeeee open, Either that, or encrypt every fucking thing with truecrypt. Liberete has built in pgu, I mean how can you beat opening your browser and you&#039;re automatically hidden?

				See, you prob thought you were going to get that browser and be fucking stoned 3 hours later, as if you were putting a pizza order in online right? me too. A lot of reading proved me wrong.

I mean hell, I do not think I have it right to be honest with you. I just started here last....Thursday I think it was...I just made my first purchase today. I have read where people take months to get to where they actually can do it properly. So be paitent. take constructive critisism and do your work. <br /><br />Have fun, if I can assist you in anyway please let me know. I can give you only what I have learned through asking and applying. There has been some trial and error, questioning. I find the techie shit a lot of fun though. Nearly as much fun as this site and it&#039;s marvel.

It was the least of my concerns of what I was doing right.<br /><br />I hope they do not change a thing. I got my 50 by asking if I was doing the business end right. It was a win, win. I made a couple spammy type thready similar too this one, like this one, I tried to keep it going and at least entertaining for those who read it. Even if I was way high and saying we todd ed shit.
