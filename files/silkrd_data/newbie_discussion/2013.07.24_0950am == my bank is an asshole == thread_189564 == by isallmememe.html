				2 weeks ago i went to buy my first btc. i made an offer on localbtc, then went to my online banking and went to make the transfer. as i did i noticed at the bottom it said about how they will call me to confirm the transaction and it said &#039;are your phone numbers up to date?&#039;. at that point i realized i got a new phone a few months back and never thought of changing it with my bank. so i clicked the link to change my number online, typed in the new number and enter. <br /><br />it was at that point it told me that it would be 3 days after changing my number before i could make any transactions. i could have fucking screamed. so next day i bought my btc by going into the sellers bank and paying over the counter. <br /><br />a few days later i signed into my bank online and there was a notice telling me my number had been changed and if it wasn&#039;t me who changed it then to contact them immediately. i even looked in my profile and there was my new number in place of the old one. cool, i thought to myself. i will be able to buy my btc a lot easier next time. <br /><br />so last night i went to buy some more btc, went to my banking site and started to fill out the form to transfer. i noticed the phone number is listed below as before, and fuck me if they didn&#039;t still have my old number there, with no sign of my new number. wtfuckingfuckfuck? i had to cancel that order for btc as well. <br /><br />this morning i made another offer and figured i&#039;ll just go in my bank and do the transfer there and get them to sort out this phone number once and for all. in i go, tell the woman i want to make a transfer to somebody and also told her the problem i&#039;d had with the phone number. i was then informed that even changing the number in the branch in person it is still 2 days before i can use it online. to add to this she then told me if its not a transfer to another member of this bank then there is a Â£25 fee for doing the transfer over the counter in my own branch. seriously wtf is wrong with these greedy fuck bastards. to do a transfer online its like less than 1 minute of typing a few keystrokes for me. i very much doubt it is any more work for them. and they want 25 fucking pound for doing it. <br /><br />then it turns out the btc seller is with one of the smaller banks and there is no branch in my town or anywhere close.<br /><br />my bank is causing me the biggest headache with any of this, more than the btc buying or the sr put together.

				You would be better of not using any high-street banks and joining a credit union instead. Stick it to the corporate overlords&nbsp; ;)

				I remember a similar fuck on for about a week to do a transfer, it takes x amount of days to register a new number in case someone&#039;s trying to scam your account.
