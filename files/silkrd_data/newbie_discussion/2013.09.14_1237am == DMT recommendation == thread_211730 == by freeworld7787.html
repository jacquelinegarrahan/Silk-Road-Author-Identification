				Hello SR,<br /><br />Yes I am a noob and I was curious if anyone has any recommendations for DMT? I have never done DMT before, I have only done shrooms regularly and I love them a lot; they help with my anxiety/ptsd and keep me very calm in between trips; mainly keep the color in my (at the moment) dull life. Unfortunately as far as DMT is concerned I have no idea what to get or how to do it. I&#039;ve looked at the selection on SR, but there is so much variety. I mean who and what do I choose?&nbsp; I emailed a few vendors, but they ignore me. I have had one successful transaction on SR so maybe because of my low rating they thought I was a scammer or LEO. Anyway, if someone would give me a good recommendation, I&#039;d appreciate it. I want something that will take me out of this world and allow me to stare our existence in the face. I&#039;ve never smoked anything before so I&#039;d appreciate if someone would recommend a HOW TO? I know that sounds corny, but bare with me, I&#039;ve never really done any drugs before.... Every local person I talk to, they always talk about their &quot;DMT blasting off experience&quot; but then when I ask if they can get some, they say &quot;Oh I don&#039;t know&quot;. <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />PS: I&#039;m looking for enough for a couple of people. I don&#039;t like to trip on my own. Had a terrible experience and rather wait till I&#039;m not such an amateur

				I recommend trying RingoDeathstar&#039;s 200mg listing. This is a nice start and Ringo is a top notch vendor. I think he&#039;s a solo operation, so he only lists as much per day as he can handle processing, so his listing seem to pop up sporadically. He has the best deals on SR for DMT, and it&#039;s top notch product. The 200mg order should be about 4 doses for a beginner and only costs $20, his grams are only $80...A+ all the way around with Ringo!

				If youve never smoked DMT before, you&#039;ll blow through that 200mg in a flash and be like uh, why didnt it hit me?<br /><br />Best way to blow some dough fast? Buy 200mg of DMT if youve never smoked it.<br /><br />Its cheap and easy to make, then youll have a never ending supply to smoke yourself and friends into the deepest bliss all night long.

				I can personally vouch for DRshrooms&#039; DMT. Buy the white stuff.<br /><br />Firstly and most importantly, you need to practice your smoking technique and get used to the experience overall with smaller doses. Especially if you have never smoked anything before. As tempting as it sounds, don&#039;t try to blast off on your first try. I can almost guarantee you won&#039;t be able to. <br /><br />When you smoke the DMT, you need to VAPORIZE it. This means you need to build yourself a vaporizer. Fairly simple, you just need to be creative.<br />A guide on how to build &quot;The Machine&quot; : *clearnet* https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=25974<br />There are a few vaporizing methods on YouTube.<br />My favorite: I essentially made a light-bulb vaporizer (*clearnet* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmixODIvAtM) out of a round-bottomed glass flask.<br />DO NOT use the sandwich method where you place the DMT in a bong/pipe in between 2 layers of weed. There is too much risk that you&#039;ll burn the precious DMT. (The flame should never be in direct contact with DMT. It will burn it and destroy it.)<br /><br />When you heat it up the powder will turn into liquid, and then as you heat it more it will begin to smoke very slightly. This is when you know it&#039;s vaporizing, so this is when you inhale. (Long, deep inhales. As many as you possibly can as quickly as you can). It will taste utterly disgusting btw, but it&#039;s worth it.<br /><br />As for how much you should buy, it depends on how many people are doing it with you. 15-25mg is a normal dose. 35-45+mg is a breakthrough dose. It would be very wise to invest in a milligram scale. (You can find one cheap on Amazon.) Dosage varies from person to person. I recommend you buy 200-300mg, so you have enough for you and your friends to practice your smoking technique on. Buy white DMT. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much difference with yellow DMT and white DMT, it&#039;s just that I can personally vouch for white. <br /><br />All the information you&#039;re looking for is all over the internet. Do your research. Good luck!

				I like the non-white the best, has more jungle love stuff in it.<br /><br />You may have better luck noobing out on some Changa which is the best DMT high next to a sesh with mama AYA.<br />Changa is way easier to hit successfully.

				Hello, @freeworld7787 and others!<br /><br />This is the best thread on DMT here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.0<br /><br />Get those 50 posts and come by - read the Original Post (OP) first for info on vendors, but I do hear good things of Ringo!<br /><br />The machine is the best budget device (you can do at home for less than 5 bucks or buy one from dmtnexus on SR) and if money is not a concern get yourself a GVG (Glass Vapour Genie).<br /><br />Read thru that thread and already mentioned dmt-nexus for answers to any of your DMT-related questions.<br /><br />One thing to mention - no description ever given to you can prepare you to what you will see. If you think that you will stare existence in the face you are up for a big surprise.<br /><br />Best of luck and be safe,<br />IM
