				Hi there,<br /><br />MidnightCowboy here. I&#039;m a new UK vendor, offering some very choice and rare BP pharmaceuticals. Mainly focusing on opiates/opioids, but have a couple of other bits and bobs that are available or on offer.<br /><br />At the moment I&#039;ve got 100mg MST Continus listings, genuine Napp manufactured, not the shitty waxy generics. I&#039;ve got listings up for one or two tabs, so you can order low from me to see that I deliver and build confidence.<br /><br />I also have regular access to:-<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50mg/2ml Methadone HCl ampoules <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30mg Diamorphine Hydrochloride ampoules<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10mg/1ml Concentrated &quot;Methadose&quot; oral methadone hcl solution<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1mg/1ml Methadone DTF formula Oral Solution [&quot;linctus&quot;]<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5mg Physeptone Methadone HCl Tablets<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5mg Dexedrine dexamphetamine sulphate tablets -these are very hard to get right now, but still possible.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also have available<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 75mg Lyrica Pregabalin capsules x14 [genuine Pfizer brand]<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30mg Mirtazapine tablets<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s how I&#039;m working it at the moment. When I know I&#039;m getting something in, I will list it and you can order it. If there&#039;s something here you like the look of, but its not listed, PM me, and I will let you know if I have it, when I can get it, and if so I can do up a custom listing for you. Just cos it aint available to &quot;add to cart&quot; doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t be got. Some of these items are rarer than rocking horse turds, and its not like I can just walk into Boots &amp; load up me trolley, [well not without the assistance of a balaclava and 12gauge, but that&#039;s not my game].<br /><br />So, I run around to the cancer patients and script fiends, bit of this, bit of that, as and when its needed. I&#039;m aiming to build up a solid, reliable business, where trust and communication are key. If I have it, I will tell you. If I haven&#039;t I will tell you when I can....and if I can&#039;t find it I won&#039;t pretend. That way you will either get sorted straight away, or you will know how long you will need to wait, or you can choose something else, or cancel. No problem.<br /><br />Shipping domestic is either by 1st class Royal Mail. None of my products have any scent, and my packing is uber-stealthy. If you give me the right address, its 99.9% certain it will reach you, very likely overnight. EU shipping can be done by Airsure, and outside of EU, PM me to discuss arrangements.<br /><br /><br /><br />±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±<br />FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!! FREEBIES!!<br />±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve offered the first ten buyers an additional free MST + 3 Mirtazapine &amp; 3 Pregabalin caps on top of their orders. Some have already gone out, but there are still some in the kitty. Please don&#039;t PM me asking for a free sample to test.....these are pharmaceuticals, the quality is assured. What I want reviewing is how quickly I got your thing to you, stealth rating [no details], communication etc etc. <br /><br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s the really important bit. I want people to be aware that some of these products are made for people with established high opioid tolerances. 100mgs of oral morphine is an OD waiting to happen for an opiate naive user, as is 50mg of IV methadone or 30mg IV of pharmaceutical diamorphine. I don&#039;t want to be responsible for supplying an od to a teenager, so before you order, I&#039;d appreciate a PM where you let me know a bit about your experience with opiates, what you take, your tolerance etc. If we are ever going to defeat prohibition it has to be by showing we can be responsible for what we take &amp; who we give it to.

				OK here&#039;s a quick review of Midnight Cowboy. I got MST 100mg and Diamorphine 30mg ampoules.<br /><br />COMMUNICATION 5/5<br />Very pleasant to deal with. He/she is personable and knowledgeable about the products and quick to respond to questions.<br /><br />PACKAGING/SHIPPING 5/5<br />Shipping was very quick. Had it overnight. Can&#039;t go wrong with Royal Mail UK to UK really and they got it in the post pretty quick. Stealth is elaborate and effective, but I&#039;m not sure if it is exactly professional looking. Very safe but maybe could be simpler?<br /><br />PRICING 5/5<br />MSTs seem pretty good value compared to others out there, although I haven&#039;t researched that so much. Hard to tell with the diamorphine ampoules because no one else is selling them. Compared to average No3 the bang for buck is not too bad, and its something you won&#039;t find anywhere else, so you gotta try it at least once!<br />He/she did give me some freebies in exchange for a review, and is still offering this on the vendor page.. Extra MSTs and Pregabalin (which didn&#039;t do anything for me - its for neuralgic pain, and can give you a buzz apparently) and Mirtazapine which is a great sleeper, not in a benzo way though.<br /><br />PRODUCT 5/5<br />The great thing about pharmaceuticals is that you don&#039;t have to worry about how strong it is. 100mg is 100mg, etc. The MSTs a great for chewing, not going to try and bang these. One chewed gives me a nice buzz for 4-5 hrs. I&#039;ve got a bit of a tolerance though so as usual start very low if you are unsure, you can always have more.<br />I&#039;ve never done pharmaceutical heroin before and its a real treat. If you work on the basis that average street gear is about 25% heroin, you will be about there in terms of dosing. I would say 30mg of this is equal to about 125mg of average brown you&#039;ll find on SR. There&#039;s no rush with this stuff. It just creeps up and washes over you. Really clean high. No itching or nausea. You have to remember that the rush you get off gear is not heroin. It is impurities from incomplete conversion of morphine, 6-MAM etc, and left over acetic anhydride, as well as caffeine and nasty cuts. The expiry date has been scratched off, so I presume they are past their use-by. That won&#039;t be dangerous, I presume it just degrades to morphine over time, and might make them less strong, or variable in quality.<br />The ampoules are sealed glass containers. You can get ampoule snappers from most needle exchanges.<br /><br />All round 5s for Midnight Cowboy. Hope he does well and sticks around. Recommended.<br />

				Just to follow up Horsetank&#039;s comment, its not the expiry date I&#039;m trying to scratch off, [though I did take that as well], its a batch number above it, which if any of the amps were ever to end up in the Oinker&#039;s trotters, their piggy snouts would soon be able to discover where that batch had gone to, narrowing it down to a very small number of pharmacies, and thus presenting a very real potential security risk to myself, or my sources, of being identified. I will also be doing the same to the batch numbers on any methadone amps before sending them out.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;:-X :-X :-X <br /><br />I assure you and anyone else who gets them that they are in date. Fresh as a daisy in fact....or should that be poppy. <br /><br /><br />SO I say fuck the pigman with his disgusting war on bodily self-possession, &amp; slave-master mentality. A curse on him and all his household.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Always been interested in the 30mg diamorphine ampoules. Are these the liquid solution amps or the ones containing the powder on the bottom of the ampoule? Chinese sourced?

Are these the liquid solution amps or the ones containing the powder on the bottom of the ampoule? Chinese sourced?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />All diamorphine ampoules in the UK are what are known as &quot;dry amps&quot;. This is a glass vial with a freeze-dried plug of pure pharmaceutical heroin in the bottom. They come in 5, 10, 30, 100 and 500mg strengths. I have seen the 100mgs in the past....big fat buggers, but the 500&#039;s remain an elusive dream. I do recall when that murderous cunt Dr. Shitman got arrested and they searched his house, seeing on TV the cops exit with a several boxes of them. <br /><br />Quite apart from his psychopathic tastes in murdering grannies, Shitman fucked everything up to do with pharmaceutical CD&#039;s in the UK. The &quot;Shitman Review&quot; severely tightened up CD control in the UK, making things much, much harder for all us hardworking chemist-shop connoisseurs. For starters the old trick of running a CD script from a private GP through a laser printer was totally blown out, but more significant, pharmacists became much, much stricter post Shitman. Beforehand I knew a couple of pill-counters who, if you performed the correct laying on of gold rituals, would have a sudden rash of &quot;breakages&quot;, &quot;spills&quot; or other unexplainable losses, among their CD inventory.<br /><br />All Perfectly normal.....but what was miraculous was how everytime a 5g tub of diamorphine powder spilled, it always managed to spill itself straight into a small brown envelope which somehow fluttered into my prescription bag. <br /><br />Those days, like the time of&nbsp; &quot;jacks&quot;, NHS cocaine scripts, Elephant brand No.4 in Chinatown, the Piccadilly scene pre-1968, Lady Frankau &amp; Dr. Petro, private scripts for Cannabis and Opium Tincture BP, all are long gone, forever relegated to junkie legend status, [at the same time some VERY BAD THINGS have also vanished the same way.....Diconal, Palfium [lovely, but fuck did they kill a lot of people], shooting methedrine &amp; barbiturates, reformulated gel Temazepam, [very few people remember that initially the eggs contained a thin oily liquid, which could be easily sucked into a 1ml &amp; injected....then the inevitable reports that &quot;DRUG USERS ARE ABUSING TEMAZEPAM&quot;, so the drug companies in their infinite wisdom reformulated them to be &quot;abuse proof&quot;, by changing the oil to a waxy gel, which soon junkies discovered could still be shot up if boiled in water to melt it. Only problem was it re-set in your vein, and cause d instant thrombosis. A genuine case of harm-maximisation.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, I have been waffling loads of shit. What I wanted to say was the diamorphine amps in no way have any kind of Chinese or any type of Asian heroin in them. They are produced from poppies grown on UK farms under licence from Macfarlan Smith, the Edinburgh drug company with the only licence to manufacture diamorphine in the UK. The poppies are cut down whole, and the morphine extracted chemically by something called the Gregory process. The only country in the world with a licence to produce legal opium by cutting the poppy pod and collecting the sap is India.

				Quick feedback for the forum readers too about my purchase from Midnight Cowboy:<br />-Lyrica x 14<br />-MS100 x 3<br />Extra received gift MS100.<br />The deal went down superfast due to the good communication with MC.<br />He knows what he is doing and knows what the customers want!<br />Reliable and highly recommended!<br />Package was nicely designed nothing special it was very well hidden and discrete so again very professional.<br />The order came much earlier as I was expecting it which we all know is a Bless in the opiate bizz.<br />So make the long story short I can only recommend Midnight Cowboy.<br />I became a fun of MC definitely and will be a return customer!<br />Cheap prices and prompt delivery with flawless communication and flexibility!<br />What else we want? A new Star Vendor on SR for sure! Thanks MC!<br />&nbsp;

				Midnight Cowboy, what can I say?<br /><br />Plenty as it turns out. This person knows their stuff (just read the post above) and is old school. This is how drug dealing should be. Talk of Dicanol and peachy palfium makes me feel all nostalgic, but I digress.<br /><br />I have had two orders so far and both have been spot on. Next day delivery with some very nice extras. Packaging is secure and discreet.<br /><br />This vendor should rise to be a star of SilkRoad. It is a shame that his stock is limited by his suppliers, but what stock. This is the good shit my friends, so if you&#039;re an old school opiate connoisseur, take a look at Midnight Cowboy. If you make an order you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br /><br /><br /><br />
