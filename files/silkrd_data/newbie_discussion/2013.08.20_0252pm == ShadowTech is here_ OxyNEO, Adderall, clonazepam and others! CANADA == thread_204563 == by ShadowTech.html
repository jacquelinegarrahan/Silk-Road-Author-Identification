				ShadowTech would like to thank SR for the warm welcome with some kick ass sales this labor day weekend.<br /><br />We are knocking all of our prices back and if the shipping ain&#039;t free for certain items, it&#039;s a fraction of what is costs us, we don&#039;t look to profit off of shipping. CAN Xpost will get a tracking number sent to you when shipped for your own piece of mind, and so if it does not make it to you, you get a full refund. Your stuff will be sent out to you, warp speed, Mr Sulu within 24hr 99% of the time. Bonuses, custom amounts, whatever you need, will be seen soon. <br /><br />Also intermittent offers of BTC for going rate + 3% to help those who have trouble finding coins to buy SR stuff. No BS, simple payment methods, available Canadawide. We know how hard it is to get started and want to help you and SR be all it can be. Don&#039;t waste your money paying the insane prices eBay sellers artificially inflate.<br /><br />We do offer US/worldwide shipping, but due to our postal system, must be sent as a &#039;parcel&#039; for a tracking number to be attached to this. PM if you don&#039;t see what you want.<br /><br />Up to now, we have simply put up our most popular drugs/electronics, but will be listing less &#039;desirable&#039; items at 3 for 1 pricing this long weekend. Check us out. All electronics are brand new, not &#039;hot&#039; and thus fully warranteed by manufacturer.<br /><br />We are the originator of GoldCobra, a drug produced with the help of certified biologists/chemists, tested, tried and true over a very long time period. It is a guaranteed quoted dose oxycodone product, seen in Canada for 13 years, but never truly &#039;public&#039; until now. Those who purchase our oxy products (non samples) will be offered a permanent place in line to purchase this extremely limited production drug, which is AT LEAST equal to original OxyContin crushables (mg for mg) in potency. As well, the first customers of our oxy get a demo of this monster, which will be offered in varying potency for differing tolerance levels. A massively potent form of this drug is being developed with a release timeframe of about 1-2 months from our Skunkworks division.<br /><br />ShadowTech member page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e39c46cf66
