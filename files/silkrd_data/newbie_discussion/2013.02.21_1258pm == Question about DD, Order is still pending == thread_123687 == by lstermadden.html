				Hey guys.. I am just trying to get some answers as to wether I should expect to get high tomarrow or not, So here is my situation. <br /><br />I ordered a bundle from DD on tuesday afternoon, around 2:00 pm.&nbsp; It is now thursday morning and it is still pending. I paid for the rush shipping and everything.<br /><br />For example last night he said this &quot;Any orders still pending, will be getting an update message from us if you haven&#039;t already.&quot;<br /><br />I was really expecting to get high tonite or tomarrow.. but I guess my coins are locked up until he either cancels the order or says its in transit. I really like DD too, Im just hoping it will be in transit today.. <br /><br />Anyone else in this boat?

				oh and im working in NYC and living in brooklyn, if anyone can help me out that would be amazing... I don&#039;t have any connex anymore..<br /><br />Edit: Whats really confusing me is that in his update on his profile he says &quot;In order to restore excellent service, we need to keep listings down for a minute. We&#039;ll post an update shortly.&quot; but both his listings are still up... i know his single stamps were not up on sunday monday tuesday, is that what hes talking about?<br />
