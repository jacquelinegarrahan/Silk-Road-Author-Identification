				Watching movies or TV shows can be good for the first thirty/fourty five minutes to get the mind off it. After that taking a walk or putting some music on can make for a nice come up period.

				This monkey always has an effect within an hour. If the acid is strong and I didn&#039;t eat bananas before then it might hit me within 30mins. <br />If it&#039;s REALLY strong then even within the 15mins I keep it in my mouth.<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid a lot of SR users do not know what real acid is. $10 + shipping is insane. A real good 400+mics tab could and should be free or like $1-2.<br /><br />Most acid on SR is supposed to be over 100mics and this is complete bs bananas. $10+ for &lt;100mics. No. This monkey prefers acid outside of SR.<br /><br />And this monkey does not recommend waiting. Just do something/continue doing something. Then if the acid is strong you will definitely know within an hour and depending on what you are doing you will notice it becomes hard to do or friggin funny.

				I would love it if acid was still less than 10 bucks a hit, but too many historical events have lead up to it being an expensive rarity for it to go back, maybe ever. Even at Furthur shows, if it&#039;s a cheap hit it&#039;s a bitter therefore a spitter. In the city forget about it, no price break until you&#039;re buying more than 10 or 12 hits. It&#039;s not that it can&#039;t be that cheap, I think it&#039;s that so few people want it that it&#039;s more of a hassle for dealers than molly or coke. For those that do sell acid, it&#039;s a bit of a labour of love. Me and my other deadhead touring bud were hanging out at his place with his roommate and roommate&#039;s gangster friends, who said they might have a link for LSD. Then, one says how he&#039;s going to charge $20 a hit, because hustling is the name of the game and it&#039;s gangst and he&#039;s a business man etc, and all I could think was &quot;you just don&#039;t get it&quot;. On one hand I feel sorry for those people, on the other I try not to feel sorry for anyone who seems to be enjoying their life. <br /><br />And that&#039;s why I will buy LSD on SR.

In our case anyway, but when ever im dosing or gifting L to newbs, I always tell them minimum of 2 hours before your tripping. Also because with that in mind, the angst will ease greatly. <br /><br />I love how people say if its not such and such or if it is such and such, than its not LSD but an nbome series type RC.&nbsp; Ive eaten more drugs in my days on gods green earth, than i would ever care to think about, and nothing, absolutely nothing, comes even close to the fuckery that goes on in your mouth when dropping an nbome.<br /><br />&nbsp;Thats coke, k ,mdma, heroin, meth, an entire galaxy of rx pills, I can go for days. Just about everything thats anything worth doing, I have done umpteen times over.. and nothing is as fucking terrible as an nbome tab. <br /><br />&nbsp;So to clear this up once more, cause I and many other OG L heads alike have said this loads of times. Bitter DOES NOT mean its a spitter. That term was coined in LSDs heyday, when there was such an abundance of Owsley and even Hofmann synthed crystal floating around. Hence there being no need to swallow a tab that has the slighted tinge of bitterness to it, when just 10 min in any direction would land you with the cleanest of clean.<br /><br />&nbsp;Blotters laid with methanol and other suspension mediums can , will and do have a bitter taste to them. JerseyCows first batch of avatars is a premier case and point for this statement. They where bitter, yet contained nothing but ridiculously large amounts of (silver if I had to guess) pure LSD. <br /><br />&nbsp;I certainly dont mean to sound rude or offensive, just gets old going over all the same things time and time again. Much love dude, and every one reading alike.

				Thanks, I appreciate the info. I figured there is some fraction of myth to the bitterness talk. The major tip-off on fake acid I&#039;ve been using is if a hit is both a)so bitter it literally numbs my tongue and b) the size of a fingernail. Accurate enough rule of thumb? While I&#039;ve only had good times on drugs that met both those criteria, the experience has been different enough from the tiny little squares I&#039;m comfortable calling LSD.

The will usually have a glossy colored surface on the blank side of the tab, either pink or red or blue ( from all that ive seen). The single best way to determine if its LSD or not, simply swallow it immediately. The nbome will not be active orally.

If the acid is strong and I didn&#039;t eat bananas before then it might hit me within 30mins. <br />If it&#039;s REALLY strong then even within the 15mins I keep it in my mouth.<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid a lot of SR users do not know what real acid is. $10 + shipping is insane. A real good 400+mics tab could and should be free or like $1-2.<br /><br />Most acid on SR is supposed to be over 100mics and this is complete bs bananas. $10+ for &lt;100mics. No. This monkey prefers acid outside of SR.<br /><br />And this monkey does not recommend waiting. Just do something/continue doing something. Then if the acid is strong you will definitely know within an hour and depending on what you are doing you will notice it becomes hard to do or friggin funny.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Mmm.&nbsp; Well I&#039;m no light weight, and when I posted I had only taken one tab! what do u think?<br />

				How much did you take the first time?<br />I read on wikipedia 25mgs of lsd will be enough for the first trip. Or did you take a 100-150mgs blottter?<br /><br />I think I would take the first time rectically. No spill en quicker hit. Does anyone knows how fast it hits then?<br /><br />Cheers!

I figured there is some fraction of myth to the bitterness talk. The major tip-off on fake acid I&#039;ve been using is if a hit is both a)so bitter it literally numbs my tongue and b) the size of a fingernail. Accurate enough rule of thumb? While I&#039;ve only had good times on drugs that met both those criteria, the experience has been different enough from the tiny little squares I&#039;m comfortable calling LSD. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not so much the whole size of your fungernail things, cause nbome can be complexed and laid to 1/4 inch blotter.<br /><br />Yes they do make your tongue numb, or even burn. The will usually have a glossy colored surface on the blank side of the tab, either pink or red or blue ( from all that ive seen). The single best way to determine if its LSD or not, simply swallow it immediately. The nbome will not be active orally.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Well this bodes well for me! I fucked up on the first blotter and swallowed it early!

Also DOC and DOI are all becoming very rare. and to tell the difference with NBOME it is easy&nbsp; as well just put it in your mouth for a minute and sallow the blotter. With NBOME you have to hold it in your mouth(sometimes against your checks or lips ) and not swallow your saliva for like at least 30 mins. &quot;SO SWALLOW THE LSD&quot; lol
