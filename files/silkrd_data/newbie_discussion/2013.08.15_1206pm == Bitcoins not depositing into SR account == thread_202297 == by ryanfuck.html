				I sent 2.1 BTC from my blockchain account to my SR wallet address about 20 mins ago. The funds are still not showing in my SR account, even though blockchain is showing the transaction as confirmed. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on. Help?

				Hey Man,<br /><br />In my experience BTC can take up to three hours to come into a SR address with the normal amount of time for me being around an hour. I wouldn&#039;t panic, just keep checking back every 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				Mellow out man, its a minimum of 10 min per confirmation. It will take at least 6 confirmations before the funds are available. Ive had it take as long as 24hrs though, on rare occasions.

				Hello,<br />First check the address to which you sent BTC and certainly agrees with established deposit with SR.<br /><br />For me, sometimes it takes up to one hour, so as a colleague wrote above you - do not panic and wait quietly.<br /><br />Oh, I&#039;ll tell you again that I never even SR billowed not :)

Well it cetainly isn&#039;t the federal reserve or the bitcoin reserve or any authority. It is handled by nodes which are people who volunteer to maintain the authenticity of bitcoin transactions typically running off of small fees in order for faster processing.<br /><br />For a transaction to be considered &quot;confirmed&quot; rather than &quot;unconfirmed&quot; and the coins to become usable it must be confirmed 6 times. The spooky thing about silk road which leads to threads like this is that they simply don&#039;t show you the unconfirmed coins therefore people who are inexperienced with bitcoin are like &quot;yipes it ate my coins oh noooo!!!&quot;.<br /><br />Next time, if the paranoia is getting to you and you want to check whether or not you typed in the correct address after all hop on http://blockchain.info/ (under tor of course) and search for your silkroad bitcoin wallet. If the transaction shows up regardless of it&#039;s confirmation status it will appear.<br /><br />Edit: I just wrote this entire post&nbsp; and then realized after that you already understood all this. My bad. It&#039;s the stimulant&#039;s fault.
