				Banks are not being threatened, if they adapt to the free market that Satoshi Nakamoto has delivered to human kind.<br /><br />The need for bunker-sized vaults with precious steel, various alloys, concrete, and armed guard still applies to BTC. Additionally, vaults will now need complex energy schemes for cooling and data transmission. Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency developed by Japan, is the answer to digital theft. It functions on globally endorsed digital networks. No one wants to reduce the amount of computing power our race has invented and developed. With the advent of Open Source, every human now has access to both private and public communications. Governments and despots, alike, have committed to restricting global communications, limiting cultural exchange and new ideas and further reducing the health of our race. Countries like North Korea give excellent examples of how dangerous totalitarian regimes actually are.<br /><br />In 1776, a group of pirates--intelligent, educated business men--deemed themselves fit for self-governance. They created an open-ended legal document that would enable their offspring to develop and modify according to socioeconomic changes through time. Times continue to change, and now another great revolution is upon not only the United States, but also the world. Global communications and access to privately owned computers--digital slaves instead of human slaves, a truly moral and honest revolution in the name of Freedom--will revolutionize the world, yielding unfettered access to the first sophisticated global exchange of material and intellectual resources P2P, without the influence and control from dishonest and unfamiliar humans who market and employ themselves as &quot;publicly elected&quot; officials, yet passing legislation and initiatives that hurt local and state economies, which turns to violence when immoral and illegal harassment, investigations, searches, seizures, incarcerations, prosecutions, executions--both domestic and abroad, for any and every nation--extortions, and social and political persecution. This is the responsibility of every generation alive today who has made it this far.<br /><br />Let&#039;s continue this revolution, and allow access to those who wish to join. It may require our migration off planet. This could truly be the greatest social (r)evolution that Earth has ever seen.

				Energy and security is the commodity of tomorrow today.<br /><br />It is produced and regulated by both private and public utilities. As energy efficiencies in computing increase and sophistication in computing inexorably improves, freedom and solidarity will result from independent and local energy production: solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, organic (biofuels), inorganic, and fossil fuels. There will need to be securities in REEs for manufacturing sustainable energy.<br /><br />There are resources throughout Earth, as well as primarily throughout the meteor belt between Jupiter and Saturn, which can sustain healthy and prosperous human population, even at an exponential growth rate. It mandates more sophisticated and efficient socioeconomic infrastructure. Global cooperation through global education standards, while preserving cultural heritage within such a framework, is the only way to survive M.A.D. as well as seemingly endless conflicts that waste intellectual and physical resources, delaying the advancement of human kind.

				Computer Science is the new form of banker. <br /><br />Technical colleges, in addition to traditional universities, are now educating tomorrow&#039;s banker. IT is a profession that now has more financial security than the U.S. Mint. It&#039;s strange how gold miners and coal miners, who supply the world with its energy, light, warmth and cooling, the endless stream of perpetual motion that we call electricity--its power--are paid so little.<br /><br />Is intelligence really just a commodity? <br /><br />Management has been left to political con artists--lawyers and political science majors that enter the public realm of marketing and sales: Public/Political Office. That&#039;s not the only haven for corruption: every institution in society has be infiltrated by the entropic state of greed and selfishness. It is time to redefine selfishness as selflessness. Not every legal expert or politician is as vile as our current administration, which seems to be governed primarily by corporate interests and shallow self-preservation.<br /><br />Have you ever heard of the Global Clinton Initiative (CGI)? It aims to turn a profit by improving the conditions of the world--both domestic and abroad, for any nation and every citizen-resident. http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/<br /><br />Imagine if we move toward a Global Bitcoin Initiative!<br /><br />Continue the revolution here: <br />## www.bitcointalk.org ; <br />## www.torproject.com ; <br />## www.linux.org ; <br />## www.dee.su/liberte ; <br />## dkn255hz262ypmii.onion ; <br />## silkroadvb5piz3r.onion . <br /><br />Yubikey (www.yubico.com) is another step in the way of Internet security. We need to remain cohesive and committed to the revolution that is stirring.<br /><br />Stay hungry for freedom, my friends.

				Dwolla still works--although its integrity might be jeopardized.<br /><br />DHS is a toothless lion for a corrupt and unjust enterprise. BTC is the answer to anyone who desires a free and fair currency and secure digital marketplace. Infrastructure for BTC protects IT and all computer-related professions--job security for as long as there is electricity to power our global network infrastructure. We have a duty to maintain free and fair use of the public commons that is technology.

Then the hand of the law (U.S. Government: FBI, DHS, etc.) would be forced to deal with national security and personal property. A public act as heinous as terrorism in the scenario you propose would make BTC and its proprietors not only victims, but martyrs. Public victims.<br /><br />That would probably be the lynch pin of the People v. Corporations/Government/Bankers.<br /><br />Cyber Warfare is not enough, I suppose, to start this dramatic (and violent?) conflict.
