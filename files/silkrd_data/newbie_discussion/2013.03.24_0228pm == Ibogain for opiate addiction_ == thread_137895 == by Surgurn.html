				I just recently discovered this psychedelic root, and have been hearing how it &quot;interrupts&quot; the craving for opiates. Does anyone have any personal experiences with using ibogain to treat that addiction?<br />Even unrelated to an addiction, what is the overall trip like? I hear enough of it will put you in a dream like state for hours, but that sounds vague. <br /><br />A vendor claimed it would take up to 10 grams to interrupt an opiate addiction. That seems like a lot more than I&#039;d assume for this to be conventional. What are your opinions?

				Ibogaine therapy is a very expensive therapy, mostly because of the quantity of the drug needed, and because you have to fly to canada or elsewhere to get it administered. I would like to see it on here myself, however it does have a low ld-50 so there is a risk you could die.

				10 g!? As far as I&#039;ve read 1-2 g should be enough. But the effects will last 24h to several days and a sitter is obligatory. Apparently it is not pleasant and going back to using opiates afterwards is very dangerous. The reasoning behind this is that it resets the brains biochemistry which means that your tolerance would disappear making overdosing very easy. But don&#039;t take my word for it. Quitting using other methods is preferable, it is to be used if you find yourself hopelessly caught in the addiction. A last resort, although a very effective such. Be very careful and good luck :)

				Interesting. I don&#039;t think it would hurt to try a lower dose at first and see if that helps. Read at least a dozen trip reports and basically any info you can find. What I read in my sources is 100-200 mg for recreational purposes (aphrodisiac/stimulant), 1-2 g for therapeutic use. I will revise my previous statement by adding that it seems that many cases of death are from pre-existing cardio-vascular conditions. Go to a doctor and do a thorough check up on his hearts condition if you are worried. Don&#039;t know if the doctor will get suspicious or if he can be convinced with some data or studies. And of course, abstinence must be mandatory afterwards. Make sure your friend understands the necessity of this before treatment :)<br /><br />Edit: You were right about the trip length, of course.

				Do some research on clinics. It might be cheaper to travel to a place where he can get help at a clinic. Or maybe you have already done that. Alternatively, research if you could possibly grow it or visit somewhere where it grows wild. I&#039;m guessing it would be hard, but it&#039;s worth looking into.

				I&#039;ve taken ibogaine 3 times for opiate addiction the last time I was also had a xanax addiction and was planning on continuing them thru the trip but was way to out of it to remember to take it and had a 2 seizures in a row before being brought to the hospital where i was administered iv ativan every few hours for several days It was a huge mistake taking it by myself, taking it before weaning off benzos it did work tho I went into a rehab afterwoods and still had to deal with benzo withdrawal but it did work for opiate addiction.

				I think I took about 15-20mg per kg whatever that works out to i think around 2 grams of hcl also do not forget to take motion sickness pills for nasuea being it wont work if you throw it up right away. have a trip sitter who knows what they are doing. The condition I was in it was well worth the 600$ or so dollars it cost being i was using that much heroin every few days and my life was just a complete nightmare. if anyone has any other questions let me know.
