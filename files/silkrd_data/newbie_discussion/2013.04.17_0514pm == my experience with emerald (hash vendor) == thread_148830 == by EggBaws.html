				Well iv waited for exactly 23 days since my order went into transit plus 3 days he took to process it ( I know people are busy) and still nothing. :( Vendor sent me a message 2 days after order was shipped saying there were holidays in spain so expect delays. I thought good guy sending me a message letting me know. Two weeks later still nothing. vendor reassured me that it should arrive. I gave enough time for the order to arrive before auto finalize.&nbsp; I stated my case in the resolution centre and asked for full refund. Vendor offerd no redund or reship due to my postage option which he states on his page. After 5 days in resolution I got 100% refund which im happy with of course but vendor didnt put any resolution up. I know he says on page no refund for the postage option I chose but then whats the point in escrow. If he tried to come and go with me I would have changed my resolution abut little communication.&nbsp; a result I got a refund, still no goods but if it arrives I will definitely be apologising to vendor and sending some BC. I left him 3/5 feedback as vendor didnt show much interest in our resolution and SR resolved our issue+ no goods. He communicated well with me in the beginning but near the end I felt he didnt care.&nbsp; I know rep is everything here and after I left him 3/5 I seen all other good comments and my not so good comment made me question it. In the moment it felt right but afterwards I wasnt sure.&nbsp; Should I have given him 3/5? Thanks for your time.<br />Egg

				Hello mate,<br /><br />I am sorry you felt disappointed, about the service. But you have to understand that I offer a completely free resend or a 50% refund for orders who have a tracking number. I know it is cool to save a few bucks and order without a tracking number, but you have to understand also my position as a vendor. I understand yours, and I know it sucks not receiving your stuff.<br /><br />I am glad we later arrived to an arrangement though. <br /><br />I hope it was finally just a delay because of holidays and that you received the hash.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Emerald

				no you should give him a 5/5---he mailed you hash, there are people who&#039;s job it is to find it in the mail.&nbsp; when they find it, They take it, cuz mailing hash is illegal.&nbsp; It&#039;s dope in the mail, not a video game from amazon. If you selected to not use tracking to save a few bucks then you took the chance.....yeah 5/5 is what you should give him.
