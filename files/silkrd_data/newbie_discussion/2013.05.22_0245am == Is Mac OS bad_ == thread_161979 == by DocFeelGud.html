				People have told me Mac&#039;s OS is the worst one to use for dark net ventures. As long as I&#039;m using Tor browser and GPG, aren&#039;t I protected??

				Someone with more knowledge about this feel free to correct me, but yes, it is safe.&nbsp; As long as you are using Tor properly, your identity is protected.&nbsp; As long as you are encrypting your address and sensitive messages, the information you input into SR is protected. <br /><br />With that being said, Mac OS is not the IDEAL operating system for &quot;dark net ventures&quot;.&nbsp; I would never use it if I were a vendor, or if I had any major concerns about being raided by L.E.&nbsp; Mac OS just lacks a lot of the customizable security/encryption options that you can implement in more open operating systems like Linux.&nbsp; <br />

				Is it the worst to use, no, it&#039;s an OS and it&#039;s fine.&nbsp; If you keep up with your updates, don&#039;t download things from unknown sites, don&#039;t login to unknown sites, make sure you logging in to the right site, don&#039;t take your mac to random places and connect to public wireless, don&#039;t click links in emails from anyone and especially people you don&#039;t know, and don&#039;t let people use your computer, you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t use mac, mostly because I used them for like 15 years, back when G4&#039;s were the like whoa and mac os didn&#039;t use stupid cat names.&nbsp; &nbsp;Back then mac os 10 would constantly give thos stupid error window with a bomb icon and restart button (mac ver of blue screen of death) but mac os has come a long way since then, they use intel now and they&#039;ve made of improvements.&nbsp; Windows really isn&#039;t much better if anything it can be worse but at the end of the day it&#039;s the user who compromises the system.<br /><br />Anyway all I&#039;m saying is whatever your OS if you keep it up to date, use tor, and keep your computer secure your fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Thanks for the input guys. People haven&#039;t been responding to my posts as they first were and I have a lot of questions still regarding the merits of Private mailboxes etc. but this was helpful. Why should you not use public wi-fi though? I was told it&#039;s harder to pin an individual signal int hat type of environment? Untrue?&nbsp;
