				Like this shit is really starting to get under my skin. I have no way to get bitcoins. I can&#039;t wait any longer. I have orders I need to place. I mean I&#039;m really really starting to get annoyed. I would use the people on local bitcoins that accept moneypak, but they all fucking rape you in fees it&#039;s worse than fucking bitinstant.

				Can someone please, please that&#039;s all I ask.<br /><br />Explain to me how to use Dwlloa or Pay2go since that&#039;s all the sellers on localbitcoins use anything else and I feel like I&#039;m getting ass raped. I feel like it&#039;s a big ass secret, I&#039;ve looked up guides on it and nothing shows even on the clear web.<br /><br />All I NEED IS SOMEONE TO EXPLAIN THIS too me. Please.
