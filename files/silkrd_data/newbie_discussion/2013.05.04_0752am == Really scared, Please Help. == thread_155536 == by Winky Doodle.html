				Please help me I&#039;m really scared right now.<br /><br />I weight 158LBS and I am 17 years old.<br /><br />Earlier this week I got some MDMA, 10 tabs that were 80% pure MDMA each. I&#039;ve been crying on and off today because I&#039;m so scared and this really sucks and I don&#039;t know what to do.<br /><br /><br />On the first day, I took 1 100MG pill. I went for a few hours and I decided to take another. This was all I took that day and then I went on to the next day, I think I took a couple more that day. Then the next day I took one or two more.<br /><br />After each time I fell asleep and woke up I felt fine and no hangover effects whatsoever. I decided I would take two more, and I took these anally, I crushed them up and used a small funnel. I actually did this twice with two pills.<br /><br /><br /><br />Over about 3-4 days I took 8 100MG 80% MDMA Green Bulls. During the last couple pills I also took about 8 Vicodin. I fell asleep and woke up and fell asleep for a whole day, and now I&#039;m awake and feel scared and really really different. What should I do.<br /><br /><br />Please help me, I&#039;m really scared right now. How long is this going to last. Should I tell my mom. I think I need to go to the hospital.<br /><br />I flushed the last two MDMA I had down the toilet, and and not doing any more drugs until this all clears up. I probably won&#039;t ever be doing MDMA again.<br /><br /><br />Please any help. Thank you.<br />

				Thats alot of MDMA, but not enough to seriously harm you.&nbsp; <br /><br />You are freaking out, getting all worried for likely nothing.&nbsp; Calm down, take a few deep breaths, drink a couple glasses of water and get some rest.&nbsp; Go to you local health food store and get some 5HTP in the morning.&nbsp; Take it every day (recommended dosage) and this will help the &quot;blah feeling&quot; that you&#039;re probably going to feel the next few days.&nbsp; Just a general &quot;sadness&quot; but nothing to freak out about.<br /><br />The &quot;difference&quot; you feel is the classic come down of too much mdma.&nbsp; Its normal.&nbsp; 200mg a day a few days in a row isn&#039;t going to kill you.&nbsp; Or even hurt you.&nbsp; The vicodin don&#039;t help though and to me are worse than the mdma.<br /><br />Drink some water.&nbsp; Have a BIG glass.&nbsp; Or two.&nbsp; Get some rest.&nbsp; Things will look better in the AM.<br /><br />And 17 years old is too young for vicodin.&nbsp; That pretty serious stuff.&nbsp; I also think its too young for Mdma.<br /><br />You will be fine.&nbsp; But stay away from drugs for a few years.&nbsp; Or forever.&nbsp; Really.

				You probably should cool off from drugs for a while dude. Taking xtc over that much time isn&#039;t going to do much for you, your brain needs time in between rolling to recharge. Something about serotonin or some such, I&#039;m not quite positive, but I do know that when I went on weekend fun times if I tried to do it too often, I didn&#039;t get the same effect.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure why you decided hydrocodone was the next best thing to do while coming down off of xtc, but 8 is a lot for a guy your size. Hell, 8 is a lot for a guy my size and I&#039;m twice your size.&nbsp; IANAD, but I would recommend you to calm down while your system gets rid of all the substances floating around in your body. Your biggest worry right now is all that vicodin. The problem with taking a bunch of vicodin at once is that it&#039;s not just hydrocodone (the stuff in the pill that gets you high), the problem is that there&#039;s a bunch of tylenol in that pill too, and too much tylonol is really harsh on your liver.<br /><br />How many mg were the vicodin pills and how strong were they?&nbsp; they&#039;ll either be 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg buffered with 500 mg, 600 mg, or 750 mg of tylenol.

				1) Silly kids shouldn&#039;t even touch drugs<br />2) Telling mum about illegal activities is dumb and will cause unnecessary stress <br />3) You play, you pay<br /><br />Relax and you ill be fine sooner or later. Go to hospital if you are scared but only admit to taking drugs if your life depends on it (you are about to die from an OD and doctors can&#039;t tell wtf is wrong with you).<br /><br />And please get off Silk Road, you are not old enough to use eBay yet.<br /><br />Fucking kids.

				I fell asleep after the roll, and woke up like this.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m still high. I&#039;ve taken 8 Vicodin (10/300 something) and 8 100MG MDMA over the past 3-4 days.<br /><br />I&#039;m just really scared like I don&#039;t feel normal,and I had some really weird dreams. I also slept a lot.<br /><br /><br />Please tell me this isn&#039;t permanent.<br /><br /><br />I looked up the best way to take MDMA, and that came up. It was with a syringe but someone also mentioned a funnel too. It said to crush up the dose and then mix it with a little bit of water, and use a syringe, but you can also use a funnel.

				Do a little bit of research on how drugs interact with your body before taking anything, ever. Drugs usually effect chemicals in your brain. They emulate/stimulate/slow the breakdown and reuptake of these neurotransmitters. By doing this, your body is left with a deficit of those chemicals. As long as you don&#039;t do heroic doses frequently for a long time, most damage will go back to baseline equilibrium. <br />Just mellow out, smoke a bowl, read a book and sleep. Doing things for so many days can really upset our delicate chemical balances.<br />Find out what your body can handle by first researching, then starting with low doses, figure yourself out.<br /><br />To good times!

				Hi there.<br /><br />Remember you&#039;re special. There is no one else like you. Your parents love and care about you. Go to one of them and let him or her know what&#039;s going on. They are your greatest allies, even if at times they also come down on you like a ton of bricks. Going to them is far better than trying to handle this on your own.<br /><br />Be kind to yourself.

				I concur with the 5htp; it acts as a type of anti-depressant to level out your serotonin levels which both viocodin and mdma can screw with. Also B6 B3 and B9 vitamins; they help stabilize your neurotransmitters and your sleep cycles. And hydrate hydrate hydrate. <br /><br />Here&#039;s my judgey judgey stuff: MDMA, especially in quantity, at 17 is asking for trouble. It can seriously mess with your brain chemistry and at 17 it&#039;s hardly properly developed. Plus, if your first inclination is to run to mom for help, you probably aren&#039;t ready to deal with the consequences of your choices.<br /><br />

				(1) Little Man you need to chill out with the drugs for at least 3 months and give your system a brake. You are going to kill yourself with the hard stuff, you just have that type of personality. Your going to be fine, just drink lots of water and drink 5H so the drugs can be flushed out.<br /><br />(2) In the future just smoke weed and never use anything else. That drug can do wonders and its not dangerous lol<br /><br />(3) And if you need a stimulant just eat dark chocolate(80% at least), or drink hot chocolate. It&#039;s proven to be a proven mood enhancer.<br /><br />(4) And talk to Jesus man, hes your best friend and I guarantee you that your anxiety will lower a ton if you do! Just talk to him like hes a friend sitting right next to you, its super easy it might feel weird at first but im telling you it is a life changer. He will get you through the hardest times like this one and future ones. He loves you man and he knows you and he has great plans and adventures for you. Im telling you give it a try it dose not hurt to try but im telling you it will change you life.

				Haha that made my day.<br /><br />Just thoughts of mine: If you take mdma the brain produces more serotonin (good feeling etc) if you do that for several days your brain will get used to that much of serotonin. So if it is getting less because u dont do mdma anymore it has to get used to the small amount of serotonin ur brain usually produces. After a couple days your brain will get used to it and create those filters it needs to know you dont need more serotonin to be happy again.<br /><br />But honestly i would never advice anyone to take mdma. I took xtc for several years at the weekends and now i feel like i damaged my brain for ever. I cant feel much. No real love, good feelings, ups and downs, etc i barely have. I figured this once when i took some special hawaiian shrooms and a day later i had all these feelings back for a small amount of time. these feelings i forgot already! Probably because mdma fucked the parts in my brain so now i would need other drugs to make me be able to have these feelings again. These are the feelings that makes u feel alive.<br /><br />However it all comes down to the amount you take i guess. if u take an mdma pill once or twice a year its probably not bad at all. Do it every weekend for several years and you will feel it.<br /><br />mdma was a big mistake in my life as i see it. An lsd trip here and there or a shroom trip is much better in my opinion and also much nicer to your body ie brain etc. <br />

				I hope you&#039;re feeling better, and above all, I hope you&#039;re not buying into the myth that you have to handle this all alone. That&#039;s why you&#039;re so scared. Handling something like this is virtually impossible if the only brain you can consult is your own. Your own brain will always give you the same answer, no matter how many times you ask it a question.<br /><br />Share this with your parents. Or if that doesn&#039;t feel safe, see if there is a counselor or teacher at school in whom you can confide.<br /><br />Finding solace in this particular forum, I can only guess, was a desperate last resort. There are many other places where you can find the help that you need. Please, please, try them.<br /><br />Best,<br />--LuckyDuck

				You&#039;ll be okay. Drink water, eat food, smoke weed(if it makes you feel better) and get some rest.

				Thanks guys. It&#039;s serious but I think my situation was making it worse. I&#039;m at the library atm.<br /><br />Ever since the come down I was inside a house, 24/7. Except for a drive and going to the store. Also before that I was in the house for like 2-3 months without going out much, because every time I decided I would, I&#039;d go do something fun and then my foot would hurt like a bitch.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to get arch surgery, been doing some workouts on it for the last few days, wish I started them earlier, but the doctors gave me the wrong workouts to do and made it worse.

				You&#039;re on Tor on the library?<br /><br />Please do more research on drugs before you take them. MDMA usage has a very characteristic hangover/depression for most people after a roll that can last up to a week. Then you take 800mg of MDMA and wonder why you&#039;re not feeling too hot? I&#039;m sorry you&#039;re feeling bad dude but you need to cool it for a little bit. Make sure you know what you&#039;re putting into your body, why you are doing it, what it is going to do to you (neurochemically, subjectively, physically, emotionally, etc.), and possible side-effects and interactions with other drugs.<br /><br />You didn&#039;t do any of those things and now you are paying the price. You aren&#039;t going to die, but you need some sober time to let your brain replenish it&#039;s serotonin. Hope you feel better. Let this be a lesson. Erowid is your friend.

For my entire life I have been able to fall asleep like a baby mid roll if I wanted to. Ecstacy or Molly is the my favorite drug and one of the reasons why it is is because I CAN fall asleep on it or at the end of the night like I want to. I know a lot of other people who don&#039;t think the same way, but, I surely know many people who share my feelings as well.
