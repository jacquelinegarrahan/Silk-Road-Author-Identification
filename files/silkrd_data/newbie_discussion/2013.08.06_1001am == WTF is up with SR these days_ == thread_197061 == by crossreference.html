				Unprofessional, unreliable, full of shit vendors trading fake goods and scamming you with orders, taking days to respond, refunding x% of purchase price while admitting they never sent the order, and pissing in your pocket while they&#039;re at it?<br /><br />Australian vendors need to step their game up. And despite good history with certain OS folk, they&#039;re quick to fuck you over first chance they get too.<br /><br />Anyway, I won&#039;t name perpetrators till they&#039;ve had a chance to come good, but in the meantime can someone please direct me to the official channel to file a complaint and seek restitution for unjustified lost btc?<br /><br />Thanks.

				You did?<br /><br />You should be able to, but most domestic vendors now are hopeless so you better choose wisely.<br /><br />There used to be professionals. Seems like they&#039;re all gone.<br /><br />My first few experiences were great. In fact all of mine have been great. Only the last couple haven&#039;t.

				Sadly when it comes down to it, we&#039;re trusting a group of (mostly) druggies to supply us with drugs.<br /><br />However.

				not braggin about being reliable, but ya, ive noticed its crazy how happy and appreciative people are on here just for giving them the service they payed for, its like jesus, i should be kissing your feet for making me money and supporting my life and family/pets without having to work some shitty job all the time, (i do work, but i can be more selective) its awesome how much it goes both ways when you treat a custumer right. I know the local dealer types though that are like the assholes on here, always shorting ppl, making em wait for ever, threatening them. From my buyer account I have been able to find some pretty respectable vendors and havent been ripped off yet, but i really check to see how sincere they sound and if there feedbacks great, i havent had a problem yet, but it sounds like there is a lot of shady lurkers if you dont do some research, some of em prolly dont even have the drugs on hand till after the order is placed, if you know what to look for though this place is awesome~

				Do your research - there are heaps of vendors out there who will claim their stealth is superior, and on the occasion it arrives, you wonder just how the fuck it got through customs?<br />Order the smallest amount for a first order - just the same way a dealer on the street can fuck you over, in fact even more so on here, you gotta realize this shit is illegal, so any mo fo can screw you over - you gotta be prepared to take the occasional loss until you find 2 or 3 reliable, honest vendors, whom you never piss off by messaging too much, you are always grateful to, and if anything ever fuck&#039;s up you keep it in house unless it&#039;s clear they aren&#039;t willing to work with you - EG - 50 % of the loss is yours, 50% is theirs.<br />Once you find them you will have a constant variety of top quality supply. Cheaper is not always better, 100% rating &amp; excellent feedback doesn&#039;t guarantee your package will arrive. Avoid the temptation to order express packaging - it&#039;s scrutinized, and&nbsp; much more heavily, and above all, NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER FE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I have FE&#039;d once, and got well and truly fucked over, thankfully on a $300 order and not a $3000 order.<br />Scammers never last long, so always check the forums before ordering cheap too good to be true gear from anyone, anytime! ;)

				In the long run as long, as SR stay&#039;s legitimately anon, wouldn&#039;t it be more profitable for venders to stay honest with their customers.. instead of screwing one or two and losing all credibility?
