				This is not the right section for this but I don&#039;t care more people need to see this, planet express is a scam he will take your money he is asking everyone to fe and will not send you what you buy. do not say you dont know that for a fact, because if you go to his profile it is so fucking blatant he is scamming.<br /><br />1.) He is a new vendor only for 1 month<br /><br />2.) he only has 1 picture of his product next to the planet express logo and that product is black tar heroin, it could be roofing tar, hash or what ever. he does have pictures for some of his other products but they are not next to the printed out logo like with the black tar heroin. <br /><br />3.) One of the pictures I know he stole because it is from the DEA&#039;S WEBSITE its the exact same picture from a seizure he just cropped it so no one would notice.(the picture he stole is on his listing for mid grade brick weed)<br /><br />4.) He barley has any feedback and the feedback he has is from selling small ammounts of FUCKING MDPV and a couple VALIUM!<br /><br />5.) after he gets some positive feedback from the mdpv HE STARTS PUMPING OUT POUNDS OF HYDRO, BRICK WEED, AND 1000 HITS OF LSD FOR 2 DOLLARS A FUCKING PIECE. FUCKING COKE, SHROOMS AND A FUCKING MILLION OTHER PRODUCTS AT LESS THAN ANY OTHER VENDOR SUPER LOW PRICES.<br /><br />6.) He offers first class shipping for $0.49 barely anyone does that, and he charges the same for price for 2 FUCKING POUNDS OF WEED. HE WAS TOO LAZY TO EVEN MAKE THE SHIPPING PRICES LOOK LEGIT.<br /><br />7.) He considers you a new buyer even if you spent one million dollars on silk road if you havent bought 5 items from him. he has only been a vendor for one month is pretty much fucking impossible to have 5 transactions with him within a month. <br /><br />8.) on his vendor page he is claiming he is really backed up, obvious that he is stalling for time so he can scam as many people as possible.<br /><br />9.) A couple days ago he claimed to be shipping out 40+ packages a day but he only had 125 transactions total. <br /><br />10.) even if he was sending 40+ packages a day,(which is a lie and that is a fact) it would only take about 40 min to package 40 orders.<br /><br />11.) no one that has left a review saying that they finalized their order ever changed their feedback to say they received it.<br /><br />12.) people have asked him to cancel their orders and he would not do it. <br /><br />13.) I suggest if you placed an order with him to change your feedback to 1 out of 5 until you recieve your order( which you wont) to prevent other people from getting scammed.<br /><br />14.) there have been other accusations of him being a scam on this forum<br /><br />there is too much fucking shit to even post that shows he is a scammer, do not send him your money or you will lose it.

				So many of these points don&#039;t mean anything, but I agree, he is a scammer.<br /><br />1. Many people offer free shipping<br />2. I&#039;d never pay more than 2$ a hit for 1000 hits of LSD<br />3. Packaging 1 package a minute? Sure if you&#039;re a fucking robot. It takes about a minute to slide a piece of paper in an envelope and lick it...&nbsp; The vendor has to print a label, vaccum pack the drug, place it gently in a mylar bag, wrap more paper around it, add additional stealth, and then he has to make the package look even, not suspicous, and real. That would take 10-20 minutes easily.<br />4. I have left feedback, and PE didn&#039;t ask me to FE, I just did it out of respect. It was a sample though, but I got it.

				Yeah I knew he was a scammer before seeing the other threads but i had already made the account i figured i might aswell make another post in an attempt to save more people from getting scammed. I think we should start a forum group that weeds out the scammers by posting on the forums and letting people know which vendors are acting suspicious or are a possible scammer.
