				A couple times I had only a few dollars left over, and just let it sit in my account.&nbsp; But with a recent purchase refunded at 50% I neither have enough money to get anything I actually want, nor is it to little money to just let &quot;sit.&quot;&nbsp; What would you do with $23.95?&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh yea, you can feel free to donate to my cause at any time :D

				I am in the same boat, just placed my first couple of orders and I have some change.<br />I have to drive my mother in law on a 2 day trip later this month, I think that would be a good time to try some edibles.&nbsp; &nbsp;That should take care of it.

				I&#039;ll bite on this, hahah<br />I personally, am about to make a smaller purchase and amd only a few coins short of being able to order double what I intend to. <br />IE, if I spend 4BTC I get a 1/2, but if I spend 8BTC I get a full OZ... At the time, I only have 5BTC and change... my happiness and my LIFE, I daresay, would be vastly improved were I to be enabled in such a way to further my habits and drug consumption. <br />holla atcha boi<br /><br />1BMhzpNdQEGqv4ABKn1Z2WSf1MynokH2im

				I agree with other posters and save it for a cushion for your next purchase. Or if you make a few orders and have change left over form each one, eventually you&#039;ll get like a freebie with all your leftovers.
