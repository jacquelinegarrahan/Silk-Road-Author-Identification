				Just wanna know if one has experience with doing H after a coke session to come down? (I know it&#039;s dangerous because they&#039;re antagonists.....therefore I didn&#039;t do it myself)

				Ever heard about speedballing?<br /><br />IV mix of C and H... the thing is, coke&#039;s iv rush is truely awesome (and addictive) but comedown is uncomfortable and comes, I&#039;d say, much sooner than if you had use it via other means.<br /><br />So, when C starts to wear off, you won&#039;t even be noticing, you&#039;ll just start to notice the H kicking in... and feel great.<br /><br />For me that is the best drug experience ever... but also the most addictive and dangerous!<br /><br />I would recommend coming down from your coke session using some good old *zepam pill... dont need to overcomplicate yourself!<br /><br />

				Yes, I know about speedballing, but that&#039;s one of the things I will not do, because it&#039;s too dangerous.<br />Besides, I don&#039;t want to inject IV.<br />Normally I use Benzos as downers, in earlier times I used H to come down from pills and speed, but not after a coke session.<br />Due to the fact that I do only domestic ordering I can sometimes get no Benzos but H, therefore I was asking.

				Hey, no way I would be suggesting or recommending IV to those who never tried! Just wanted to point out it is (should I say was) a common drug mix...<br /><br />My advice would be, probably as you do with benzos, to wait maybe a couple hours after your last take of coke before taking the H, and then do it bit by bit, you should be fine... But this is not an expert advice, just common sense from old-time user!

				Yes, i know about the coke IV feeling and the come down....in those days I did take Benzos before my coke use because of the turndown afterwards, I hated it, same thing with smoking....<br />maybe I will try it the way you have pointed out, I thought about it the same way. thx
