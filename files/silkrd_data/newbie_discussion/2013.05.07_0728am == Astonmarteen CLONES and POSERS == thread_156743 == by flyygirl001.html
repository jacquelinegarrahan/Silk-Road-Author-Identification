				There is only one AstonMarteen. And He is I. I will NOT tolerate a debate on this topic. I simply won&#039;t have it.<br />To the guy making fun of my Training in the SS. You really want to kick a sleeping dog?? Do YOU? You need to learn to respect your commanding officer, son. <br />I was shoveling shit in Lebanon, Pakistan, Honduras, Iraq, Egypt, to name a few when you were in diapers playing with your little stubby little cute babydick. I wont tolerate ANYBODY dendegrating my skills, my training, my service to this wretched country, and my abilities to survive.<br />Survival skils? I&#039;ve got enough to make your fucking head spin.&nbsp; Thats why Im never a paranoid vendor. I know that if the day comes when the &#039;jig is up&#039; and the coppers get hot to my trail, I&#039;ll simply pickup my go-bag and vanish. Nobody will fucking find me. How do you find someone who doesn&#039;t exist? Either you don&#039;t or you die trying. Get it, bitch?<br /><br />Flygirl - what is your purpose, who sent you, who do you work for? Identify yourself hoe.

				Yea it does make sense for AstonMarteenOfficial and AstonmarteenSR to clone the ORIGINAL...because the POSER is a HATER, a dick RIDING BITCH ASS PUSSY who has a lot of mouth on here but in person wouldn&#039;t have shit to say, even to a FEMALE BITCH like me. You&#039;re my SON. Homey I&#039;m from the hood my shooters have shooters.&nbsp; Not that I&#039;ll ever have the chance or ever even ATTEMPT to see your punk ass in person because no matter what this is business and I&#039;m not that damn stupid...So I guess all this shit talking leads to nowhere and no matter what you reply next I will not have anymore to say for entertainment purposes. And I&#039;m sure this is all very entertaining, but what I hope to do is weed through all your slick words and proverbial bullshit and keep it real since obviously YOU CAN&#039;T. I don&#039;t give a fuck what war you were in, act like an ass in these streets and get your dumb ass murked. So please, you can act like this and that on here (SR/forums etc. basically over a computer) funny guy, but the message I&#039;m sending you straight from me to you is that YOU ARE PUSSY. Period. Point blank. I want that message to be felt in your heart. And I hope you have better sense in the streets because people tend to take it kinda personal when you fuck with their money you bitch ass nigga. I don&#039;t have as much free time as you do I&#039;m out here hustling hard so I won&#039;t entertain Yea it does make sense for AstonMarteenOfficial and AstonmarteenSR to clone the ORIGINAL...because the POSER is a HATER, a dick RIDING BITCH ASS PUSSY who has a lot of mouth on here but in person wouldn&#039;t have shit to say, even to a FEMALE BITCH like me.
