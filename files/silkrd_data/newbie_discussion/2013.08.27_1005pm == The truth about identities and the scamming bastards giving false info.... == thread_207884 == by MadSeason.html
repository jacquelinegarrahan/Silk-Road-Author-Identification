				&nbsp; &nbsp;I started replying to someone who was trying to sell me shit and calling it caviar and decided that the information would be better served by telling everyone why to NOT trust these people who are selling information on changing your identity.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will lay out the &quot;plan&quot; these tool sheds tell you to do, and then I will pick that sonofabitch apart piece by piece.<br /><br />&nbsp; I urge anyone....ANYONE, to refute me on my information. All you peeps out there taking others&#039; BTC and&nbsp; giving them this SHIT information ought to be stoned to fucking death....you are no better than common snitches as your information will lead to the arrest of everyone that tries it.<br /><br />&nbsp; Let&#039;s begin:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the information that is currently working its way through SR, ATL,BM:<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; You find someone whom you want to be...say Tom Smith.&nbsp; You then research Tom Smith via Ancestry or social media sites, getting all pertinent information on the subject including Mothers Maiden, DOB, Address, County of Birth.<br /><br />&nbsp; Once you have found all of that, you are to call the County Clerk in the County of birth and come up with some asinine excuse as to how you are Tom Smith and you have lost your BC in a fire or something.&nbsp; Then, the county clerk will just believe you and ship you a new birth certificate to you! <br /><br />&nbsp; With a BC in hand, you get yourself some health insurance as Tom Smith.<br /><br />&nbsp; Once armed with the insurance card and BC, you are supposed to travel to your nearest Social Security Administration and apply for a SSN under Tom Smith.&nbsp; You won&#039;t get one, but you&#039;ll receive an I-55 form saying you&#039;re ineligible because you haven&#039;t met the burden of proof required to prove you are Tom Smith.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Then...you walk your ass to the DMV with all of the above paperwork and apply for a DL, which they will just give you.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;All of the above is a FANTASY!!!!!&nbsp; If you attempt any of these asinine things, you will 100% be AREESTED and charged with identity theft.&nbsp; GAURANTEED!!&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Now lemme pick this bitch apart and save many of you from PRISON:<br /><br /><br />First, it is against the law in all 50 states for any county clerk to give out a birth certificate to anyone that doesn&#039;t show a VALID PICTURE ID.&nbsp; I mean....do you scamming fucks actually think that any clerk in any state will just take your word that you are Tom Smith over the phone and agree to send you his BC????&nbsp; At the very least, the clerk will ask for you to fax a copy of your license/ssn, they will not just believe you...COME ON!!<br /><br /><br />Second,&nbsp; let&#039;s assume that somehow you actually convinced the clerk to send you a copy of Tom Smith&#039;s BC.&nbsp; There is not an insurance company on the planet that will sell you insurance without your SSN.&nbsp; The scammers will swear that there are, but use your common sense here people.&nbsp; Insurance companies are about money and information.&nbsp; Without a SSN to verify who you are and the information you gave them, you will not get insurance.&nbsp; PERIOD.&nbsp; Since you don&#039;t have Tom&#039;s SSN yet, your process should stop right here, but I&#039;ll move on.<br /><br />Third, let&#039;s again assume that you somehow found insurance under Tom&#039;s name and have his BC.&nbsp; Now, the scammers will direct you to walk right into your local Social Security Administration armed with Tom&#039;s BC and insurance card.&nbsp; You will fill out an I-55 form requesting a SSN or a duplicate card.&nbsp; You will not be able to do this by mail, you will have to sit with a clerk and the clerk will be asking questions.&nbsp; You will hand the clerk your I-55 form and you will be denied based on the fact that you don&#039;t have enough information to prove you are Tom Smith.&nbsp; You will supposedly be handed an &quot;ineligibility form&quot; and be able to waltz right out the door! <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#039;s think about the above scenario for a minute.&nbsp; Don&#039;t you think the clerk will ask you what your SSN is????&nbsp; What will your reply be?&nbsp; Perhaps,&quot;I never memorized it&quot;....how utterly fucking stupid!&nbsp; She won&#039;t believe that any more than if you tell her you&#039;re Jesus Christ.&nbsp; You can&#039;t say you never had a SSN because remember...you are using Tom Smiths information and Tom Smith definitely has a SSN. Shit...the clerk will have Toms SSN on her computer screen right fucking in front of her. So I ask you...how in the FUCKING FUCK will you convince this clerk that you are Tom Smith??&nbsp; What if she asks you where you work? Old addresses?&nbsp; She has this information right at her fingertips....and you don&#039;t.<br /><br />&nbsp; Have any of you been to your local Social Security Administration lately??&nbsp; If not, lemme break it down for you.&nbsp; It is essentially a jail.&nbsp; You walk into the place and there are armed guards, metal detectors, and very very smart people who are trained to spot identity thieves and their tactics.&nbsp; Everything must go very smoothly or you will be detained and held for questioning.&nbsp; They need no warrant to do so under Patriot Act 2 and NDAA.&nbsp; I defy anybody to walk into the SSA and attempt this.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Now...let&#039;s assume yet again that you&#039;ve had a run of luck, and stupid people, and actually got the denial letter for the SSN.&nbsp; You are now supposed to walk into a DMV armed with all of Tom&#039;s information and apply for a license.&nbsp; Scammers will tell you that it&#039;ll be easy peasy, but again, you&#039;ll be arrested immediately and here&#039;s why:<br /><br />&nbsp; First, it is illegal in all 50 states to have two separate drivers licenses under the same name.&nbsp; Do not believe the scammers when they tell you that only a few states share information...THEY ARE LYING.&nbsp; Currently, 40 of the 50 states share a database. The other 10 have until January 1st to comply via the Affordable Care Act of 2009.&nbsp; If you actually supply Tom Smiths BC and SSC to a DMV clerk, she will run the SSN through her database.&nbsp; If Tom Smith has a license in any other state, it will pop up...as will his picture...you are arrested.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; To play Devils Advocate here, let&#039;s assume that Tom lives in Alaska...a state currently not in the database...and you are awarded a DL in his name.&nbsp; The new DL of Tom Smith (yours) will be the only one that&#039;s valid....meaning that since you are only allowed ONE DL by LAW, the newest one supercedes the old.&nbsp; Now, you are just biding your time until you are caught....hoping that the REAL Tom Smith never gets pulled over, never applies for a CC, a loan, or has his license scanned while purchasing beer....his license will pop up as invalid and then he will try to find out why.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What will he find?&nbsp; That you stole his identity.&nbsp; How will he and LE find you?&nbsp; Well, like a stupid fuck, you had your picture taken at the DMV when you applied for a DL.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Last step according to scammers is to waltz back into the Social Security Administration armed with your ID and apply for a SSC.&nbsp; This time, you&#039;ll supposedly get it thanks to that license.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />In my fit of rage writing this, I may have skipped over some of the points I wanted to make, but the basics were touched on.&nbsp; Do not attempt anything like the above.&nbsp; It&#039;s stupid, and it won&#039;t work no matter how many times a &quot;seller&quot; tells you they did it and it works fine.&nbsp; You are not smarter than the people you will be trying to dupe, be honest.&nbsp; You will not be able to sit in front of a Social Security Administration clerk and have any sort of plausible story without her getting suspicious.&nbsp; <br /><br />You scammers selling this bogus information outta be fucking shot.&nbsp; You&#039;re no better than a common snitch.&nbsp; In fact, you&#039;re much much worse as you are profiting off of the future misery the buyers of your phony information will be put through using your asinine &quot;system.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps you folks pitching this nonsense outta read the LAWS of the United States before you scam peeps.&nbsp; Patriot Act 2, NDAA, and The Affordable Care Act all touch on the things you are telling people to do and mitigates or stops all instances of identity theft as you describe.<br /><br />If any of you think that Government is stupid, go ahead and try the above crap and see what ya get.&nbsp; These people are paid gobs of money to stop exactly what the scammers giving you this info are telling you to do.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t getting a &quot;new&quot; identity....you are stealing one.&nbsp; When you steal an identity, there&#039;s no telling what point you will get caught because you don&#039;t know Tom Smith.&nbsp; You are merely hoping that Tom doesn&#039;t find out...but he will for sure once tax season comes.&nbsp; So now, assuming you actually pulled this scam off, the identity is only good for a matter of months!&nbsp; Considering the months of time you&#039;ve invested in this scam visiting offices and running around finding stupid clerks, the money for insurance payments and DMV fees,&nbsp; tell me how it&#039;s even worth the effort!!!!!!!<br /><br />I have been researching identities for months and months now.&nbsp; There is no way at all to get a verifiable government issued ID besides paying a good Black Hat to actually hack databases and input the information themselves.&nbsp; That costs about $15k and is worth every penny.&nbsp; Do you think that any information which costs less than a hundred bucks should be trusted?&nbsp; NOPE.<br /><br />I DEFY ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DEBATE THIS SUBJECT TO DO SO.&nbsp; I WILL PROVE THAT YOUR INFORMATION IS JUNK AND YOU WILL END UP SLINKING AWAY IN DEFEAT WITH YOUR TAIL BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.&nbsp; QUIT GIVING OUT THIS INFORMATION TO PEOPLE YOU FUCKING ASS CLOWNS, OR YOU&#039;LL DESERVE ALL THE KARMA WHEN IT COMES AROUND.

				It&#039;s so easy to get an ID for less than $500 ... just check TOR! Fortunately I had little delusions these fake driver&#039;s licenses, health cards, etc. have any long term survival value beyond finding shelter so long to plot how to get enough cash for the time and security needed to procure the services of a real Black Hat. Problem is not becoming complacent and procrastinating on the project.
