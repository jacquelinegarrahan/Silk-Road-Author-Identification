				Can anybody give me some advice on mixing these two drugs? How do they effect each other when taken on subsequent days, and how about when taken together? How would you go about taking them together? Are there extra concerns to be had when combining these together over a weekend, or at the same time?<br /><br />Cheers

				Nothing like a good Hippie Flip!<br /><br />Drop your L, w.e the dose may be.. then about 3 hours in, when on the peak, parachute your typical dose of MDMA, the safe dose for MDMA is 1.5mg per KG of your body weight. Enjoy.

				Right on Raf. This is also good advice OP.<br /><br />The reason i suggest dosing the MDMA at your first L peak, is because the L will have multiple peaks through out the coarse of the first 4-8 hours. Dropping the MDMA at the first peak will ensure that you will get the MDMA peak both with and with out the L peaking, as MDMA is fairly short lived, the peak effects anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;In all honesty though OP, raw MDMA is so damn strong that when your blowing up from the MDMA, the L is entirely canceled out until you begin to roll down, the beauty of the candy flips, is that with the LSD running so strong while dropping shit like MDMA or K, that when your not feeling the other stuff, your still tripping balls off the L, hence having ZERO crash off the MDMA or w.e else.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the advise guys. Much appreciated! Does dropping L after recently taking MDMA have reduced effects?

				No, but what it will do often, is when ever the L peaks, you get the sensation that you are rolling again, when you didnt take any MDMA that time.

				Yeah that&#039;s what I&#039;ve read. I&#039;ve read conflicting stuff, but perhaps taking L soon after mdma is more of an issue as you are mentally drained and physically tired, rather than a tolerance issue.
