				How many people have used this website? <br /><br />I am curious because Bitinstant has started to suck ass and if it continues, I am going to need to find a new way to get bitcoins<br /><br />Someone mentioned that Bitcoin Brokers was better than Bitinstant anyway and it was anonymous.&nbsp; However, when I went on there, they make you create an account.&nbsp; Can anyone with experience in using this website let me know how to best utilize it, how should you create an account (can you just use all fake info) and also how do you get the bitcoins into your wallet?&nbsp; And any other information that would be helpful in using this site that I didn&#039;t ask...<br /><br />Any advice would be much appreciated!<br />Thank you

				BUMP<br />I&#039;m sorry but I&#039;m seeking this answer as well. Bitinstant is not what it used to be and seems a tad bit too sketchy now. I&#039;d like for some one who has experience with Bitcoin Brokers to answer the OP&#039;s questions. Thanks!

				I always use localbitcoins.com<br />There are reputed vendors online at all times and with escrow you r pretty safe.<br />transactions usually take less than 5 mins.
