				No. I know this is the internet and it has a vast amount of trolls/bullshitters but as honest as i can be/come across it was seriously just three tabs of acid. I know the feeling. don&#039;t know the dosage but dayum it was beyond ridiculous and not a pleasant high even in the beginning. I thought i was brain fucked and just had to start dealing with it.<br /><br />After 24 hours i confronted my mum about it, after 36 hours i ventured out side into the city and tried to cope. rest of the time was trying to sleep but just rolling over and over in bed, and also having shower after shower. At one point i almost drowned on the snot building up in my sinus, and i tried to smoke weed but it tasted/felt like smoking lawn. <br /><br />Though i haven&#039;t had DOx i am quite rehearsed with hallucinogenics and drugs in general.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had multiple LSD trips also MDA, DMT, 2ci, 2cb, peyote, mescalin, morning glory, salvia and two types of mushrooms.<br />The peak was for 65ish hours got to sleep after 72 hours of dropping, and roughly 95 hours of not sleeping. <br /><br /><br />Dropped at 5am, tripped for 72 hours. Can only put it down to not eating/drinking and moving much and my metabolism not working it out as quickly as it should have. I did some research shortly after and i think i came to the conclusion that the gland that process&#039;s acid is only being able to process so much and the rest just banks. <br /><br />Not pleasant don&#039;t reccomend. <br /><br />

				Yeah some of my best trips have been on acid, but altogether I tend to prefer shrooms. For me shrooms feel more meaningful when I&#039;m tripping and for a couple of days afterwards I&#039;ll feel pretty uplifted and positive.

I don&#039;t like it.<br /><br />If you want to see if it&#039;s possible to trip from thc then I suggest you try edibles lol.

				once uve tripped on lsd or dmt or even a nice dose of shrooms youll realize what a true &quot;trip&quot; is and realize you cant have a real psychedelic experience with only thc. as for the synthetic thcs i dont know much about but ive heard of people hearing whispers an weird psychotic type shit, so i never tried that. no ones died from weed so ill just stick to that :) huge pothead started when i was 9 and ya it was sooo much more intense back then but it doesnt even compare to lsd

				I can get visuals from weed if I smoke a lot right before bed. Looking into the dark bedroom almost asleep can cause some visuals. I could see moving shapes after getting ripped when I hadn&#039;t smoked in a few weeks. <br /><br />But they were not acid visuals. Those are different.<br /><br />A few people have asked about DMT in this thread. DMT is like 10 minutes of a hard acid trip. As soon as it hits your lungs, you start heading down the rabbit hole. Visuals, sense appreciation, otherworldly feelings, they show up instantly and stick around for about 5-10 minutes. A half hour after smoking DMT, you&#039;ll be firmly back on the ground (at which point you can smoke some more). I think DMT is actually what a lot of people are looking for with weed, or at least it complements weed tremendously.

				Acid is the only drug I know of that can fuck with your brain and soul permanently.&nbsp; It could destroy your entire world.&nbsp; See that old hippie in the park talking to know one, yet cursing up a storm?

				I love acid!... Tried 130ug twice and will do it again in higher dosage.<br />So far, it is almost on par with shrooms. <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe it compares with the NBOMes, since they have the dopamine structure like the 2C family.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186682.msg1359283#msg1359283">Quote from: HighGradeDelivery on July 20, 2013, 04:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Acid is the only drug I know of that can fuck with your brain and soul permanently.

I guess having a spiritual home can be beneficial here. But &quot;destroy&quot; is too harsh a word here IMO.<br />And I agree with you in, that shrooms seem to have less side effects. Your dosage... 1 gram of dried cubensis (?), would just give a glimpse of a trip however. The actual &quot;trip&quot; seems to start at 3-4g for me, or make it 2g if i add some Syrian Rue.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186682.msg1354394#msg1354394">Quote from: SmokesHisBroccoli on July 18, 2013, 08:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">However, marijuana is my drug of choice by a mile and most of the time it&#039;s a good trip for me.&nbsp; [...]shortly after they banned it and they started coming out with the new synthetic stuff.&nbsp; It was just never the same to me.&nbsp; The new stuff was very addictive and me and my friends would be smoking through packs of that stuff every day or two.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d rather do more different classic psychedelics (such as acid/shrooms/DMT) than even trying out strange new chemicals even if they are yet legal.

The first time i tried them, 1 was enough for some fun at a festival plus 1-2 hours of moderate tripping during the peak.<br />A slight afterglow lasted 72 hours. <br />And don&#039;t ever think that they are weak!... 11 tabs is for hardheads only :O<br />Btw: I got a feeling, it also matters if you chew them blotters or swallow them whole.
