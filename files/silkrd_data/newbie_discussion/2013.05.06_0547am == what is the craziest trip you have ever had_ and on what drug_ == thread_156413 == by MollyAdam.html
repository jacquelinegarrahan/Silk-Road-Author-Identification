				my craziest trip would have to be the night i took over 200mg of pure MDMA was disconnected from my physical body for about 2 hours walking around my house and stuff while my body was still in the chair in my room with my friends surrounding it. i could stand beside them without them knowing i was there. at one point they thought i was dead because i was unresponsive to outside stimuli. but one of them checked my pulse and said i was fine...<br />i also remember hearing their thoughts...that is how i describe it because when they were all done talking i could focus on one when he was not talking and in my way...hear his thoughts..

				I have had some crazy trips and some of that shit i will be taking to the grave. <br />I once had some hallucinations where i was in reality sitting on the ground talking to gf, but in my head i was working a checkout counter. what sort of crap hallucination is that! I once was tripping really hard at night by myself but it turned bad so was trying to snap myself out of it, and so was trying to do &#039;normal things&#039; i would do if i was waking up - turned on the tv, made myself a coffee, tired to make breakfast, all at like 10pm lol. Made sense to me at the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh and once i projectile vomited everywhere in a friends room and passed out straight away, that was fun.
