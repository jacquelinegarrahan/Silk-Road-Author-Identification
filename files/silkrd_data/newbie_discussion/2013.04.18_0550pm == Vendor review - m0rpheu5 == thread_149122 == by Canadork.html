				I ordered 50mg of 2-CB and 100mg of 2-CI from the vendor m0rpheu5 last week. (For those of you who don&#039;t know what those are, they&#039;re designer psychedelics. Think of an lsd trip, except it doesn&#039;t take up 12 hours of your day.) I also ordered about 5 other things from 5 other vendors, and his came the most quickly. (Probably due to my location, but regardless, shipping was prompt.)<br /><br />His stealth for the packaging was good.&nbsp; I&#039;d even go so far as to say it was creative. His communication was solid as well. I asked if he could label what he was sending so I wouldn&#039;t get them confused, and he did.<br /><br />And as for the product? 100% legit. Fan-fucking-TASTIC. Personally I prefer these sorts of psychedelics because the trip usually lasts about 6 hours, which makes it a lot more manageable. So if you&#039;re looking to try out a great psychedelic from the 2C family, grab yourself a little 2-CB from this guy. (Just do your fucking research on erowid.org or something before you take any so you know how much to do. This is very potent stuff. A tiny little sprinkling of 15 or 20mg is more than enough.)<br /><br />Thanks m0rpheu5! I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be doing business again in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;
