				has to be here as I am not wasting my time trying to get to the post count number.<br />Ordered a 1/2 oz of PE from him. I believe he shipped the same day. Arrived fast and accurate, great to do business with. I have started growing my own shrooms, but if I ever need any more, I will not even bother checking anyone else out. I now consider him my go to source for PE if needed. Will check occasionally to see if he ever gets into anything else. Obviously a very happy customer fwiw.<br />Sucks I can&#039;t post it in the vendors section. To be honest, I really don;t get the point of the post count. Would be one thing if u had to actually make worthwhile posts, but just sitting down and posting silly crap to get thge magic number seems fruitless to me. It takes way too long using Tor for me so the only way i will ever get there is if I make that many purchases as I will leave my opinion on it here.

				Thanks for posting man! I&#039;m looking forward to getting some PE from him since they were the first shrooms I tried and I have not had them since then. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure they are crazy potent, but let us know how they are!
