				don&#039;t understand why they need the 50 limit. they have capchas and mods to prevent spam right? seems like a pointless waste of time.

				i guess it kinda makes sense to me. <br />to keep ppl from just making an account and spamming the threads. if you are willing to do 50 newbie posts before you post in the main forum, you are prob not gonna waste thread space as much. you know, its our training wheels man. lol

				I think the mods should delete any of those &quot;spam to get to 50&quot; threads that people post in, and make them actually contribute to this newbie forum for a bit, instead of just posting junk.<br /><br />If they&#039;re posting junk in this forum, I think it&#039;s a safe bet that they&#039;ll be posting junk in the other forums too, once they&#039;ve gotten past the barrier.

I spammed my way to 50. When I showed up I really didn&#039;t see any interesting content in the newbie section, and I&#039;m not a spammer so I wanted in. With all the threads I figured that was just how you do it. It took an entire night though. I didn&#039;t know about the option at the time to not warn someone else has posted. But if someone wants to post in another thread I don&#039;t think it&#039;s so bad, at least the spam threads are clearly labeled. To get 50 real posts in here with how slow it is would take a bit too long I think. Eh idk
