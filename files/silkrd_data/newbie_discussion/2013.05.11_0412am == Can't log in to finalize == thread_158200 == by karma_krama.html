				Issue... SR access is though an iPad, so I have to rely on what seems to be an inconsistent onion router app. Although it&#039;s been adequate and allowed spotty access, I&#039;ve been completely blocked from log in screen the past 6 days. Frustrating because i am trying to build credibility, but also still have a good amount of credit left in my account. After log in, Im either sent to a blank page or SR error page. Or I&#039;m consistently rerouted back to my log in page? I&#039;m stuck and cannot finalize my order that was placed over 8 days ago. Any suggestions or advice out there? Thx.

				Is it a page that asks for your PIN as well?

				No pin request. Even tried setting up a different account to test if my account was hacked. But either log in, still not getting past the captcha.

				It&#039;s good that it wasn&#039;t requesting a PIN - the concern was that you might be at a phishing site.<br /><br />Are you saying that you have two accounts and you aren&#039;t able to log into either of them?&nbsp; That makes me suspect that it&#039;s an issue with something on your end rather than on SR&#039;s end.&nbsp; Have you tried restarting tor / using a new identity?

				Thanks for the help. My laptop is through work, so I&#039;m pretty sure they wouldn&#039;t want me using Tor.. Or SR for that matter. Ha. Gonna look into getting personal comp ASAP. In the meantime, I need to get in touch with my seller. I don&#039;t want to jeopardize credibility: and also need to clarify why my order was inaccurate. Nice to know I can come here for newbie support and questions!
