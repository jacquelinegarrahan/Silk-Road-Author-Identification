I really want to be gaurnteed to have a good time though, I have social anxiety and get really shy. Has any one tired Chemicals Red Bull pills? Cheers for the advice guys!&nbsp; ;D

				Hey,<br />190mg is a pretty good first-time dose in my opinion. Just have a light meal 3-4 hours before dropping, and drink at least 250ml of water per hour whilst rolling, because people pretty much only ever have problems as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />Hope you have a good time, I&#039;m sure you will ;)<br />- JH

I&#039;m not much of an extrovert, but on MDMA I feel like I can strike up a smooth conversation with anyone, and just dance without caring.

				Once that shit starts to kick and you feel wave after wave of good vibes and euphoria you will forget being shy around people because who gives a shit it feels so good to roll lol. If you roll with the expectation of your shyness fucking off completely then it may happen. You are the master of yourself buddy. I used to be shy as well and drugs like MDMA and LSD have helped me break that &quot;shy&quot; <br /><br />Pink Floyd - speak to me breathe <br /><br />Listen to that and you will realize what it&#039;s all about...shyness be gone

				The first time I rolled was 180 mg and I was the only one rolling out of about 10 people (of whom I only really knew 2). Usually in those situations I stick to the folks I know and have a hard time making small talk with the others. Once the MDMA kicked in I was having conversations with everyone in the group and also other random people at the show. All of my social anxiety type inhibitions were gone and I had a freakin&#039; blast! Enjoy yourself, and (as others have said) make sure to stay hydrated, especially if you are dancing your ass off a sweating a lot. If you are active and sweating, take some of those Emergen-C tablets along (like you use when you get sick they... are available OTC in US) and dissolve them in a cup of water every few hours. It will help your body regain some of the electrolytes you are losing through sweat.<br /><br />Happy rolls, brother.

				so much greatness in this community. I&#039;ll just repeat what others have said drink moderate water, not enough you&#039;ll get dehydrated too much it will sit weird in your stomach and might give you an upset stomach or something. The biggest thing is let go. I&#039;ve had a few friends that have tried it with me and there are two groups. People that love it and people that hate it. There&#039;s only a few that hate it but they are control freaks and couldn&#039;t let go and just let the experience be enjoyable. If you go into ready to have fun then you will simple as that. Have a great time man and be safe. We don&#039;t stumble or fall we trip and roll.

				Hi!<br />&nbsp;They say stating dose should be 80-120 mg.. with a booster 45 min or so later.<br />&nbsp;However.... I would rock the whole pill.<br /><br />I was so unbelievably FUCKED on my first roll.. I will truly never forget the feeling, it can only be expressed as if I could say I had been touched by god.<br />Simply amazing.<br /><br />On a side note, have a good time.

				my advice is to take it easy. It may be overwhelming to begin with, but you add so many words to your vocabulary when you use the letter E, you will love it!! Have a friend who is experienced with words containing the letter E with you, in case something goes wrong..

				&quot;safer use&quot; would be to take a half. 120mg MDMA _can_ be too much. you can get eyes rolling and gurning. what is your problem in taking a half one, putting the other half somewhere and taking the second half later?

				I&#039;ve read that 120mg is the best general dose for everyone. Too much is bad in this case. <br /><br />Also, it&#039;s not too fun to take alone. Make sure you&#039;re with someone when you take the rest of those.

				If the pills are really 190mg and it&#039;s your first time I&#039;d start with one full one, see how it hits you, then pop the half when you&#039;re certain you can handle more.&nbsp; you&#039;ll have a great time I&#039;m sure!&nbsp; but once you pop that pill, there&#039;s nooo going back! stay safe and keep hydrated!

				Hi,<br /><br />These pill are quite strong: start with half a pill. In my experience the redbulls take a bit long to kick in (maybe because of the hard pressing?), so be patient. Once you are rolling and comfortable with the effects (or if after an hour you notice you needed more, it depends on person, bodyweight, etc), take the second half. Drink enough water, but without overdoing it (drinking too much water can be as unhealthy as not drinking enough). Like 0.33 liter bottle/hour should be fine. Don&#039;t mix it with alcohol, enjoy the MDMA by itself, it deserves it! (I like to smoke some weed with it though, during the comedown).<br /><br />Be healthy: the week prior to rolling, eat well, sleep well. You will enjoy the roll more. Afterwards, give your body time to recover. If you want to roll again, wait for at least a month. MDMA is a wonderful drug, but do treat it with love &amp; respect. You&#039;ll have a great time!<br /><br />ximp

What kind of festival is it? Is it outside? How long is it? They rarely check as hard if it&#039;s outside. It&#039;s not like you have quantity. Chances are they wouldn&#039;t frisk you hard enough to find 1/2 a pill in a baggie, if you&#039;re too scared to take the whole thing. In addition, if it&#039;s an all-night festie, you might want to have your back-ups with you, to continue feeling good the whole time. I can&#039;t tell you the amount of times I brought substances in w/o them knowing (at least in the hundreds, never once been caught). Before you go in, watch those checking at the gate and see what they&#039;re doing, and adjust. Even if they are patting people down, you can still get away with it. I&#039;ve never had a wallet checked, but they will have you pull it out before they pat you down. Pull it out before you get to the gate, place the pill inside a compartment, and hold the wallet, keys, lighter, etc. in the same hand and lift your arms over your head before they touch you. Sometimes, they check cig packs, but not always. You can always fold up a baggie and tape it on your leg next to your balls (where they won&#039;t touch you), or use a large rubber band around your thigh. You can always tape it to the tongue of your shoe. 3 hits is not that much. They would just confiscate it, anyway. You wouldn&#039;t get charged. I hate taking something too early and not having the plateau for the whole show.<br /><br />If you have experience with hallucinogens, 180-190mg won&#039;t completely floor you. It&#039;s a good dose for the first time if you&#039;re ready to have fun. If you don&#039;t have any experience with anything, take 1/2, and wait at least an hour to two before taking the other half. Trust me, you&#039;ll want the whole pill (and possibly more) before the show ends, if it&#039;s a festival.

				Loads of good advice in this thread, nothing really to add. I would just echo what people have said re: food. If you&#039;re gonna take a hefty dose of mdma for the very first time, have a bit of toast or something a few hours before-hand. <br />The emptier your stomach, the stronger the experience, but lots of people feel nauseated on mdma, tiny bit of food helps with that. <br /><br />Keep some water on hand too. Especially if you&#039;re gonna be dancing around a lot. lol.<br />&nbsp;<br />Most important though.... Have fun! <br />

Maybe a little top up of 30-50mg when you peak. <br /><br /><br />Make sure you have plenty of water, people you are comfortable with and some nice music you can dance to

				I only buy Molly, don&#039;t want to sound negative but I have had some nasty experiences with pills and cant risk eating one that is full of shit. With molly you know what you are getting one small dose and you know the strength of it and you go from there. I find 50md is easily enough of the strong clean molly I&#039;ve been getting from a great vendor here on the SR. Follow that with 15-20mg each hour and you can go all night roll after roll. Pills can have anything in them even here on SR.&nbsp;

				I can&#039;t recall the actual mechanism of action for magnesium vs. clenching or chattering, but it definitely helps (take a supplement shortly before you take the molly). Some also recommend calcium, and/or a multivitamin just to cover all your bases.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to be in a place where it&#039;s hot, and/or you&#039;re engaged in vigorous physical activity (dancing, or, shall we say, other more horizontal things), staying cool is important. MDMA slows down your body&#039;s renal system, so you retain water and don&#039;t sweat or pee much (if at all... although paradoxically you&#039;ll feel dehydrated later). To avoid any risk of water toxicity (if you drink nothing but water, you&#039;ll make yourself very ill. Think of the chick who died a few years back drinking gallons of water in a radio contest for a Wii.), drink water with added supplements, or gatorade, or other fluids that add more than just H2O (you&#039;ll need sodium and potassium, mostly, to maintain your body&#039;s fluid density).<br /><br />Don&#039;t get too overstimulated, but on the same topic, don&#039;t just roll on your own... from my limited experience, it can be a rather boring thing to sit there, unless you&#039;re very engaged with something fun.<br /><br />Since MDMA does deplete your serotonin, the next day you&#039;ll probably feel very mellow or a little hungover. Take supplements like 5-HTP (Tetra-Hydroxy-Tryptophan), which you can get at places like GNC, to help restore your serotonin and tryptophan levels, and to help you rest. Some individuals who&#039;ve rolled end up feeling both listless AND restless afterward because of the various neurochemicals being depleted.<br /><br />From what I remember, it takes about 10+ days for your body to restore its Serotonin levels fully if you&#039;re in good health. I&#039;d say 2 weeks between rolls is a good time period.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				If you are going to a rave bring money for water(or bring your own water). You don&#039;t want to be dehydrated.Plus, the food there is mainly very salty fries and pretzels. Those assholes seriously do that shit on purpose then increase the cost of bottled water.

Apparently Magnesium is used in the inhibition of action potentials along motor neurons and many people are often not getting the recommended daily amount. In addition an slightly increased dose over the RDI can have a muscle relaxing effect due to that mechanism of action. This would mean that this should work across substances.<br /><br />Also, on the note of serotonin. I noted that no one mentioned this yet: if you&#039;re taking any anti-depressants (specifically MAOIs or SSRI/SNRI&#039;s), I would recommend not taking them for a while (the waiting period varies based on half life and metabolism) to avoid getting serotonin syndrome (or worse: serotonin toxicity). This is one of the road blocks me and some of my friends have which made it more difficult to try Molly (a few of my friends braved the withdrawal). Interestingly enough they don&#039;t really need to take that SSRI much anymore, but that&#039;s just more speculation on the matter (although I guess there are therapies now using MDMA+therapy to cure certain depressions and PTSD).
