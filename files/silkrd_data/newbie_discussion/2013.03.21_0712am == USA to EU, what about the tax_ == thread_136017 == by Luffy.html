				Hey guys and girls! :D<br /><br />Could anyone describe how this works?<br /><br />I&#039;ll likely be making an order of about 1-3 ounces of weed from the states to Europe soon. Sweden to be exact, (mentioning this because our customs are a bit pickier than say, France)<br />I&#039;m guessing the shipment will&nbsp; be sent in a small box as it won&#039;t fit inside an envelope.<br /><br />Will packages of such little weight even be considering for taxing? Or do they actually consider every single package?<br />If so, won&#039;t they be wanting to know the value of the package and it&#039;s contents?<br /><br />If anyone here would like to share their experiences and advices for such a purchase. Please do (:<br /><br />Thanks for your time everyone!<br /><br />King regards, Luffy :D

				Depending on the strain, quality and humidity of the weed you choose the tax may vary. To more liberal countries like the United Kingdom or Germany you will pay a flat tax of 30 Euros (+- Â£35).&nbsp; In Sweden they are trying to support the local industry through protectionist trade barriers, taxes on imported weed may go up to 600 SEK per ounce declared or if caught when not declared the penalty may go up to 10,000 SEK.<br />So remember, always declare your weed to customs to pay your fair share of taxes. <br /><br />Yours truly,<br />SAPO

				The previous post was a parody. Who in their right mind is worried about being taxed when importing an illegal substance that if caught is a criminal offence and not a tax issue.<br />I believe the amount of 3 ounces is too big a risk to order from overseas. Plus, if the seller uses vacuum packing, after 3 or 4 days your package will be the most strong odour in the vicinity.<br />I am in nordic countries too. packages from EU always arrive. I am awaiting 3 packages right now. From EU and from another non-eu country.<br />Pray for the best
