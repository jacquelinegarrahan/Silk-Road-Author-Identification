				Anybody tried these? They seem to be all over SR at the moment and claim to be 200mg+ yet lab reports as low as 50mg and unknown substances in them!?<br /><br />www.checkyourdrugs.at/media/ChEck-iT_Warnungen-0613.pdf<br />

				Yeah I tried one a few weeks ago man and thought they were amazing. Thought they were much better than the partyflocks and even the Nintendos that are from the same presser. I saw some of those test results too, strange one. <br /><br />Dunno if the presser has maybe fucked up the latest batch or summit. Or maybe a copycat?&nbsp; If I remember correctly there was a similar problem with the Ferrari shields, one of the batches (2nd maybe) was very low MD content apparently.&nbsp;

				Its hard to tell dude, those pictures are kinda shite, you cant make out the bull at all. The one with the thicker width looks slightly off. <br /><br />Mine are the same colour. I still have some. Could take a picture and upload it, but I&#039;ve no idea how to do this safely. If you could tell me how to do this, I&#039;d post a pic of mine.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Id say they were copies.<br /><br />But a second note for advice is get yourself a EZ test kit <br />and check out pill report they have a shit load of lambos. (All tested ok)<br /><br />I ad 2 from Honest trades..

				^^ yeah the ones on those reports don&#039;t look right. I bought mine of a reputable vendor on here too and they were the real deal, def high md content and felt very clean. <br /><br />If you&#039;re buying them from a good vendor on here Metro I think you&#039;ll be grand.

				One as the right size 10.1 x 5mm but colour is of, <br />mine are exact the same as the ones on pill report here<br />http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=31580<br /><br /><br />But then moisture can account for colouring, (hold it in your hand is enough)

				The dimensions, especially thickness are different between the good tabs on PR and the bad ones. The bad ones even vary in thickness between the 2 tabs tested. I&#039;d be measuring the dimensions of any lambo&#039;s purchased.
