				I have been buying my bit coins from btcxuk for the last 4 months without any problems. I would usually have the coins in my account within 24 hours depending on if it was bank transfer or cash deposit. On Thursday I made a large deposit in cash to his account its Saturday now and still have not received the coins, to add to this tor mail isn&#039;t working so I cant contact him by email which is worrying me and I&#039;m starting to think I&#039;ve been scammed by a reputable seller.<br /><br />I will update this post and confirm if I&#039;ve received the coins or not. :-\<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Can you tell me how to send him this forum thread ? The only way I have of contacting him is through tor mail and I&#039;m having trouble getting into my account.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

				Freedom Hosting, which hosts a large number of hidden services including Tormail and probably Btcxuk&#039;s site, is down at the moment. <br /><br />I would assume/suspect this has something to do with it.

Tell him you are worried, and have made a thread to see community input. Nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />Good luck in acquiring your BTC. Worst comes to worst, you can do an unauthorized withdrawal of your money back. You have his account number and name. That&#039;s all you need.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />er, I think you might need password and internet bank login details too I&#039;m afraid
