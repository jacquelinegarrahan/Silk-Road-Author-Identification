				We need new(or old) vendors that are willing to ship high quality stimulants (Meth and Cocaine) to Australians, Quickly and allow us to stay in Escrow. Especially if we pay the exorbitant rate the current vendors charge us for tracked shipments (Often upwards of $150.00)<br /><br />I have used AmericaOnDrugs, The Company, JaysonWoods, Miss Demeanor, SourMilk and MarijuanaIsMyMuse. Everyone of those companies have taken longer then 2 weeks (The company to 29 days) to ship to me even after paying for an excessive express fee. Yet I can receive packages of MDMA, Marijuana, LSD, shrooms etc from countries far and wide with delivery times of as little as 5 days without any excessive po istage fees.<br /><br />Big money is to be made by people who can fill this niche <br /><br />I can&#039;t be the only person who thinks this needs to change.

				I definitely agree with this. Australia has the highest markup so there needs to be vendors particularly from the US or UK to wholesale to Australia.<br /><br />I have lost nearly 0.5kg from other countries and even getting US/UK vendors to bulk is hard. I was even thinking of going over just to ship to Australia.<br /><br />Really simple, just need quality and speed. Paying even $120-$130g is fine if we can get it in 5 days.

				We actually were going to keep all of our orders domestic inside of the US, until recently we had some requests to ship to AUS. We fulfilled the orders starting with 1oz High Quality Product and now we have built a steady and LOYAL customer base in AUS. We have been told from buyers with stats well above $50k -$100k that our stealth as well as our product is of superior QUALITY. We have been so successful with AUS that we in fact are now offering 100% guaranteed delivery to your door. Typical shipping time if I ship on a Monday before 10AM PST will be there with a guarantee date usually the following Monday by 3PM GUARANTEED. My ways of stealth shipping are above and beyond when it comes to INTL orders you can believe that, especially with me offering a 100% guaranteed delivery &amp; free reship if seizure. We use tracking on all of our packages you can believe we will exceed your expectations with our QUALITY product and amazing SERVICE &amp; SUPPORT! Any doubts or questions feel free to message me and check my page and discussion page. Yes, this is a fairly new account but I can assure you I am on many markets as well as IRC networks we are well established within the underground community. We are here to provide a TOP notch service when it comes to product and customer satisfaction. Thank you friends and take care!<br /><br />

				This is very possible but coming soon just like our introductory sales for the ice we do have access to some fish scale but like our ice introductory we will start with small sample orders to feel the waters and go from there. It is in the near future possibly this week if everything follows through. We will be providing pictures with test kit as well to show purity before even thinking about competing with other top ranked vendors! We wont even bring it on here if it is not of QUALITY! We dont want to list anything &#039;cheap&#039; or low quality. We aim for superior product and QUALITY &amp; SERVICE is what you get when dealing with us! Send me a message regarding the white and I will be sure to send you out a free sampler to show good faith in our business we know our quality and service will surpass your expectations friend! Take care<br /><br />-UnlimitedLife
