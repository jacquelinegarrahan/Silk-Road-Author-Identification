				Clearnet just means &quot;normal&quot; websites that are not onion sites. If you&#039;re clicking through a web link from deep web to the &quot;clearnet,&quot; it&#039;s a nice courtesy for the poster of the link to alert you to that fact before you click, to help people stay aware of their personal privacy and security at any given time, hence &quot;clearnet warning.&quot;

				learned something new today. But I still don&#039;t quite understand the warning part. If you&#039;re on clearnet through TOR browser, is there anything to worry about by just being there? I can see why you wouldn&#039;t want to access any personal sites tied to your real name (i.e. email, bank accounts, clearnet forums, etc.). But is there a risk to just looking at clearnet pages?<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve been wondering about this for a while: is it safe to have a clearnet browser open at the same time as TOR and SR?<br />(If these are stupid questions, forgive my naivete. I know how to use TOR and all, I just don&#039;t fully grasp its inner workings).<br />

				If you view a clearnet site with TOR your IP still is not traceable back to you. Go right now to a &quot;check my IP&quot; site, it will be some weird tor-exit-node shit

All traffic in the non-Tor browsers will show up as your normal IP from your internet provider. So it is safe to access personal accounts and info from the regular browser, but NEVER do it from Tor.
