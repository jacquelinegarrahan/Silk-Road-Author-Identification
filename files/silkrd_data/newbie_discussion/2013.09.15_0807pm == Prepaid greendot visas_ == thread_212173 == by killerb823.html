				Hmm, well I assume that it&#039;s the same as a credit card so there are a few options;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Virwox; Although the fees are high it is still viable for using a credit card, however it may take 48 hours to fund your first time and there is a Â£48 limit your first time<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Localbitcoins; there are many options that you can use to pay localbitcoins with;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Create a paypal account with your card and find a suitable vendor for this method<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -OKPay will let you send money with a credit card for a vendor to pick up, but this may take some time<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Sepa bank transfer - By using the website TransferWise you&#039;re able to make a sepa bank transfer via credit card, there are many vendors that accept this on LB<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Amazon cards - some vendors accept amazon cards if you are able to buy them with your card.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -UKash and PaySafe cards; You can easily buy paysafecards and UKash online from many sites (such as pcgamesupply.com). These can then be converted into btc by using http://www.e-currency-exchange.com/.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Withdraw the cash and send it through the post; usually gets you the best rates, but for obvious reasons on of the slowest ;D<br /><br />This is all I can think of currently, hope this helps. :)<br />~D

As far as I&#039;m aware this card is simply like a normal credit or debit card, and can be used as such. :)<br />~D
