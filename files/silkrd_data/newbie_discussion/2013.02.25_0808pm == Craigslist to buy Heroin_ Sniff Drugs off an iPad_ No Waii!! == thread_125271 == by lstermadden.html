				Hey guys, Just wanted to share an experience I had this weekend with you guys.Since Deluxe had a backup problem with his supplier, I had to go &#039;Off The Road&#039; To get myself some heroin for the weekend. <br /><br />Using my tormail, I replied to a www.backpage.com ad for &#039;20$ iphone cases and red bags&#039;. I asked him if he can get a bundle out to me in brooklyn within the hour. He said nah I would have to take the railroad to him, but he got me if I need. <br /><br />So this guy was solid with communication, and he met me in his car at the railroad station as promised. This was the first time and hopefully the last timeI will ever use craigslist/backpage to get an H connect. Luckily it all worked out for me and I got myself a new connect! Everybody wins :) PS : I was a little worried about him being a cop.. but then I realized, theyre not trying to bust a guy picking up a bundle.. He should have been more worried that I was a cop and going to bust HIM... The Dealer.<br /><br />Also I found a great technique to secretly sniff heroin or any drugs wherever you want, Even at your job.<br /><br />All you need:<br />1. An Ipad or even an iPhone.. <br />2. Your Wallet (MetroCard / CC, and a Dollar Bill)<br />3. The &#039;Goods&#039;<br /><br />Excuse yourself from the desk so you can do some &#039;business&#039; and it may take a little while.. Just say &#039;Taco Night Last Night&#039; .. Your coworkers will understand..<br /><br />Step 1: Pull pants down.<br />Step 2: Put ipad on your lap.<br />Step 3: Pour drug of choice onto the screen<br />Step 4: Use your CC or Metrocard to chop up the drugs and make into lines.<br />Step 5: Roll dollar bill up and this might take some gymnastic skills.. but you<br />have to lean over the ipad, and sniff the lines, Quietly of course<br />Step 6: Enjoy secretly getting high in anyplace that has a bathroom :)<br />

				Buying/selling on Craigslist sounds like something that would take great balls of steel.

				I&#039;m pretty sure you can find some way to put stuff in an iphone. Either that or buy/make a slightly bulky iphone case and then drill a series of compartments, making small pin holes at the top of the case and then snort away.

				how does one go about getting a connect (without knowning a friend that knows a guy), &quot;Off the Road&quot;... I only did it once and it took months before I asked and I just guessed the guy dealed. <br /><br />Glad everything worked out for OP
