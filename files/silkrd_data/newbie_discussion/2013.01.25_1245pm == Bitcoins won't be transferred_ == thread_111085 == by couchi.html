				Hello,<br />yesterday morning, about 26 hours ago, i transferred some bitcoins from the site i buy them, to my SR account. <br />I already read, that it could take some hours for the bitcoins to arrive on my SR account but as i said its now a whole day i waited for it. <br />People suggest to take a look at blockchain.info or sth..i did that, and it is stated as &quot;transferred&quot;. <br />I already messaged SR Support twice but didn&#039;t get any response..<br /><br />is there any hope my bitcoins will arrive? its the first deposit i made after my first one, a year ago. the adress in my sr account seems to be the same. i hope i didnt had to change this address..<br />

				Worth double checking the address on your account page.&nbsp; After 26 hours you should have got 6 confirms, at least blockchain should say so.

				If the address is definitely correct, and you need to double-check and make sure it is, then you need to contact the Silk Road staff and possibly even try to escalate it to DPR. I hope it wasn&#039;t a large amount, because if they think you&#039;re trying to scam them, then you&#039;re gonna get fucked.

				Yes, i double-checked...triple, quadruple checked the address..its the same one i used a year ago, no misstyping, everything is correct. blockchain.info shows a &quot;green arrow&quot; which for me means it arrived..if i search on blockchain.info for my adress i still see my old transactions from bitcoin.de to SR.<br /><br />as i said i already sent a message to SR Support via SR contact us form. is there another way to contact SR staff?<br /><br />what does DPR mean? <br /><br />and no..of course i dont want to scam..its only 3 bitcoins i transferred, but i have another 10 i want to transfer to SR but of course i dont gonna do this until the other ones arrive...i dont want to lose hundreds of euros...

				if you send them all your info and really transferred it to your SR account the staff will load it onto your account. same thing happened to me aswell just that the staff was really quick to fix the problem. just give the staff a little time. Some of them might not be awake. or already asleep....no one knows :)

				Ok thanks. I hope you guys are right :) <br />I told the support the address which i used to sent my bitcoins to, the website i bought the coins and how many it were, and of course when i transferred the coins. should be everything they need to know. <br /><br />maybe now i got some time to take a look at this PGP thingy...just read that you should encrypt your address when ordering sth. on SR. *cough*
