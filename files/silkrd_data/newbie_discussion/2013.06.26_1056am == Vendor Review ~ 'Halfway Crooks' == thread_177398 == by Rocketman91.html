				I would like to start off by saying this is possible the most friendly vendor I have ever met on Silk Road. Excellent fast communication, answered all of my per-order questions in detail and with great speed. He also let me know when It had been dispatched and an estimate of when it would arrive. So communication 5/5.<br /><br />Delivery Speed was good as well. UK to UK. I ordered it late Sunday evening. Was posted out Monday, and arrived on Wednesday. Unless your paying ridiculous prices for a next day courier service, You can&#039;t really do better than that. 5/5 for Delivery Speed.<br /><br />I wont give away his stealth packaging but it was very good. No smell whatsoever. Didn&#039;t look suspicious and when I eventually got down through the layers of packaging It was nicely vacuum sealed and labeled. Just like it should be. For a new vendor I was extremely impressed. 5/5 on Stealth.<br /><br />Once opened the package I was presently surprised to have been given a few freebies! I assume samples of new strains. In the package I got 1.0 bang on of Super Lemon Haze (original product I ordered). 0.3 of black widow and a further 0.2 of Something Big Bud, writing was slightly difficult to read. I also received a nice pre rolled joint of Psychosis Chesse which I&#039;m yet to try yet but smells amazing. 6/5 On product. <br /><br />Overall I cannot fault this vendor. I will defiantly be purchasing more soon and considering Halfway Crooks has only been a vendor for 15 days, I can see him shooting to the top 1-3% of vendors very shortly. I hope this review gives him the recognition he deserves and If you&#039;re thinking of buying from him. Go ahead, I can promise you, you wont be disappointed :)<br /><br />

				First of all many congratulations to HC&nbsp; for providing a top Quality Service, a service that if the business plan was presented to Sugar we would not have to watch a bunch of retards every week as it would have been accepted instantly.<br />I am not new to the SR root of acquiring weed. Over 12 months ago one Sunday night there was an item on radio 5 on the subject of SR and in that time SR has become my only dealer. My usual weed consumption when work is plenty full is OZ a week much less nowadays only get to spend £100 on weed on a good week. For those who are still wondering what is the best route to obtain BTC, my personal preference is transfer money into my OKpay account and then to Localbitcoins.com, the hassle of getting a OKpay account was well worth it because you can buy BTC almost instantly at localbitcoins. My usual routine is to transfer on Monday takes till Wednesday to turn up in OKpay and by the late afternoon I have BTC in my SR account and if you use a good vendor you have a spliff in your hand when the postie arrives Thursday. If you want good quality weed of&nbsp; many varieties grown by people who Know how to Grow SR is the place to be, and you will not go far wrong if your fist steps down the road bring you to HC his operation has been slick from day one.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS. Better add some criticism for a bit of balance. When sending out a &quot;your order has been sent&quot; message, the message &quot;your order has been sent&quot; does it for me&nbsp; ;)

				Crooks is the 2nd vendor I&#039;ve tried on SR, and for the foreseeable future I don&#039;t see myself trying another! Great product with free samples, I got a gram of Kali Mist that arrived with 0.3g of Sensi Star, 0.3g of Big Bud, and a pre rolled joint of Burmese Kush; all great smokes, but the Kali Mist especially was the best I&#039;ve ever smoked. Stealth couldn&#039;t be faulted either. 5/5 for the product<br /><br />Delivery speed: I ordered around 4 in the afternoon, it arrived the next morning at 11.30, even though I was 2 hours outside the next day delivery time. Can&#039;t ask for better than that. 5/5<br /><br />Comms: Quick responses, helpful and most importantly, exceptionally friendly! 5/5<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				The following review is from my second order from Halfway Crooks.Both times were the best SR experience I&#039;ve had. Once again Halfway Crooks exceeded all exceptions in every department.Samples are great way to try new strains I never considered before thank you very much!As for my main order Kali Mist,all I can say is wow.Truly amazing strain made me feel happy and energetic relaxed,talkative and no paranoia.I could write a page about how good this stuff is I can honestly say it is my new favorite weed. If you hate couchlock and feeling lethargic or you&#039;re unsure whether to try just buy it,smoke it and thank me later :) Thanks again Halfway Crooks!

				I have not wrote any review previous but i thought this man deserve a nice review from me.<br /><br />I order 1g of Strawberry Cheesecake which i received in good time and also i got 0.3 of psychosis cheese, 0.2 of bb cheese and a little pre rolled. I was happy with this. The two samples were real good and the Strawberry cheesecake was exceptional.&nbsp; I had with it 3 of the finest joints i can remember smoking in a good while. It tasted, smelled and smoked beautiful.&nbsp; I will be buying from this mans again he was&nbsp; real friendly and responded to my messages instantly.<br /><br />I have had a happy Monday thanks to you Halfway crooks i wish you all the best

				First green i have purchased on SR, and i cannot see myself going anywhere else for it ever. This person/people have got things locked down, gave such a high level of expectation in comms i thought it was a little insane but everything promised was delivered and surpassed by far. <br /><br />Best part was it wasn&#039;t a big order only a little one but the effort put in has left me with nothing but confidence for larger orders without any issues. <br />Also received a J for free of another strain &#039;Silver Bubble&#039; which had never heard of but was very potent and smooth. As for the Kali mist all i can say is this vendor is providing the strains as advertised, any one who knows a little bit about cannabis strains knows the reputation of Kali mist and this has been well grown and cured. <br />Wasn&#039;t as familiar with Strawberry Cheese Cake strain but you can definitely taste both the cheese and the fruit cross strains in it. Again potent with a sweet and sour flavour make it very enjoyable. <br /><br />Anyone who is concerned or has any doubt about any aspect of what this vendor says need not be, product is what is advertised not like you get from the street calling it whatever just to bump up&nbsp; the price up. On weight or over on every order, no smell what so ever which had been a big concern to myself but has been completely alleviated by Halfway Crooks (very much appreciated!). Don&#039;t think i can give enough credit for this vendor, package received within 24 hours, just everything about this vendor cries out professional who cares about the product that is being sold no bull shit on his homepage believe every&nbsp; word. <br /><br />If you are still not convinced i cannot see how you will make a purchase on SR, this is the level the bar has been set at in my opinion and i am a chronic chronic user for the past decade plus his products are up there with the best i have ever had the privilege to smoke. <br /><br />Hope you are SR for the long haul, looking forward to my next order. It has truly been a pleasure conducting business with yourself/&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				Hey everyone, Im new to purchasing off SR although using tor etc for a while.<br /><br />So far ive had a few purchases from HC and all i can say is its been a fantastic service all in, 5/5 for everything. The communication and customer service is like nothing ive ever experienced before,truly amazing, Will answer any question no matter how trivial in quick time, seems like a really friendly person, really positive.<br /><br />HC also helped me to work PGP and was more that happy to answer any questions i had regarding it , Sent me some links which were great, was even good enough to send messages back and forth until i got the hang of it. Cheers man! I can see why HC has a 100% positive customer feedback, understanding that the customer is best kept happy.<br /><br />So far ive tried the Kali Mist &amp; Strawberry Cheesecake, had a free joint arrive with each purchase, was lemon haze and ukcheese, You cant beat getting free samples! Id prob say the Kali cheesecake was my favourite, was bone dry,one massive bud, smelled like lemons and pineapple, thats the only way i could describe it and a great high. The cheesecake was nice too cheesy yet fruity taste and smoke with a nice high too. Much better quality bud than im used too. The packaging was top notch aswell and next day delivery is just great.<br /><br />Also everyone recommend a friend to buy and you and them will receive an extra 0.5G with your order, i had British Columbia Big Bud. See HC&#039;s vendor page as its listed there or check with them. So all in all if things keep going the way they have theres no doubt that HC will rise to the top of Vendors.<br /><br />So still new to this but i hope there are more vendors like HC out there, If not i always have someone to count on for quality product, Communication and quick delivery.<br /><br />Cheers again HC

				Seeing as there is a forum thread on the subject of Halfway Crooks, I thought I&#039;d give my review on them as well. As other have already said, HC are providing a fantastic service. I&#039;ve ordered from them twice so far, and each time, they have exceeded all expectations. The back and forth communications have been excellent, and very friendly, the delivery time has always been the following day, and the quality of the product has always been top notch. Of course, not forgetting the generous amount if extras that they throw in as well. On my second order with them, they actually set up a custom order for me, as what I wanted from them was not in their listings. Fantastic vendor on the Road, in every aspect.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve not read all the reviews on here but I assume it is safe to say that my review will be agreeing with everyone else. From the first message I received from HC I knew I had found a good seller and he didn&#039;t let me down at all. His customer service is absolutely first class as is his weed! I got some Strawberry Cheesecake and some Purple Kryptonite Kush both really really nice smokes, lovely enjoyable stone from both without the vicious paranoia inducing head-fuck you can get from some strong weed. I also ordered some of the Jamaican Hash Oil, which I had never tried before but is lovely stuff, looks all black and tarry at first like it would be oily and nasty but on closer inspection it is actually dark green and smells weedy and organic and clean. Smear a little on a skin with a unbent paperclip and it really spices up any joint! <br /><br />Also got some free samples which was a really nice bonus, the pre-rolled J had me nicely blazed before I&#039;d even un-packed the main order!<br /><br />Just about to arrange for another order with HC, he is the man!<br /><br />&quot;Cos ain&#039;t no such thing as halfway crooks,<br />They scared to death and scared to look&quot;

				halfway is by far one of the best vendors on SR and is the only one i use!<br /><br />from the minute you place your order to the minute you take your first toke the process is flawless. fantastic communication at all times and he&#039;s always more than happy to help out and answer any questions you may have. when the gear arrives not only are the weights generous but there&#039;s often a little added sampler which goes down a proper treat. then of course there is the gear, and god dammit if its not some of the best gear i&#039;ve ever smoked! between a friend and i we&#039;ve tried most of the strains on offer and each one packs a real nice punch. current fav is the blue jack cheese (at least i think that&#039;s what it&#039;s called!), a brilliant smoke with a great head-high and very good at keeping you on your feet and doing things. smells brilliant too so all in a nice tidy package.<br /><br />anyways, enough rambling - halfway is seriously a vendor you need to get involved with.

That was before my time on here though.<br /><br />Personally, the service I&#039;ve received from HC has been second to none. Always next day delivery and very fast at responding to messages. <br />

				The best UK vendor in my opinion, if not for the quality of his buds, then for his second-to-none customer service.<br /><br />As expected, his delivery time is top-notch. With each of my orders from HC, I&#039;ve received them two days after ordering. For example, I ordered the product on a Wednesday night, and it came on the Friday morning - you can&#039;t ask for anything better than that! To further sweeten the deal, the stealth was superb. There was no smell, and the buds weren&#039;t compressed to the point where they&#039;re pancaked!<br /><br />Inside the packaging, my 2g of Kali Mist awaited. Upon opening it, I was surprised to see yet another set of freebies. Like last time, 0.3g of Super Lemon Haze was included (fantastic product), along with a pre-rolled UK Cheese joint.<br /><br />Through both my orders from HC, I&#039;ve purchased the famous Strawberry Cheesecake and Kali Mist. The Cheesecake itself was a good product. Once you open the bag you see why it gets its name - it has a sweet strawberry-like aroma. The bud itself was very dense and grinded up like a dream. Smoking it was a little bit of a let down in the taste department, I expected it to have a stronger taste. However, with that said, by the time I had sat down the weed hit me hard and I was couch-locked for a long time. <br /><br />4/5 for Strawberry Cheesecake - it does exactly what HC says it does. But if you&#039;re looking for a a strong fruity taste, you may not get it.<br /><br />The Kali Mist was a surprise order. The picture that was on the listing done the strain no justice; it was an absolute dream to smoke. The buds themselves were thick, dense and glistening with crystals. I tried it out in both a blunt, and through joints originally and was pleased with the effects. Once I tried Kali Mist with my vape, it took me to a whole other level; with the high lasting ridiculously long (in a good way).<br /><br />5/5 for Kali Mist. I&#039;ll defiantly be ordering some of it when its back on HC&#039;s listings!<br /><br />As I said before, if this vendor isn&#039;t to be rated for his amazing weed, then he should get 5/5 for his great customer service.<br /><br />I&#039;ve dealt with a few sellers on here who&#039;re pretty shady when it comes down to communication, and who treat me like an annoyance rather than a customer. HC however is nothing but friendly. He makes talking to him easy, and I thus feel more inclined to ask questions/to express concerns. What makes things better is that HC always has an answer! A class act in the community.<br /><br />Overall, I can only see HC shooting up in popularity. Out of the 2 products I&#039;ve tried, and the 2 I&#039;ve sampled, I feel confident in saying that HC deserves to be amongst the top vendors on SR due to the high-quality of his products. Ordering from him is a no brainer - so get to it! :)<br /><br />

				This guy, and I can say this with all confidence and assurance - is the best vendor there is with regards to weed on the road. Tell you what, best vendor on the road hands down.<br /><br />Not only does he/they care for his/their customers, and I genuinely mean that. Hear this right - ordered 1g of UK cheese and 1g of Strawberry Cheesecake and was asking him about when his Kali Mist (AMAZING!!) would be back into stock and he said it sold really quickly, so what he does is add the 1g Kali Mist to the order free of charge and for me to pay him back next time. Now that is how you keep a client happy, that is the trust that makes a client come back and back again..<br /><br />I mean if that wasn&#039;t enough his product regardless of stand will have you coming back anyway.<br /><br />The communication - as soon as its shipped to you, you get a notification and an estimate to when it arrives.<br /><br />The quality - all his strands are out of this world. My personal favorite and recommendation is the Kali Mist.<br /><br />The transaction - Please please please please PLEASE FE for this guy, it really really helps him/them and I swear they are worth at least that for the service they provide. Make a few orders, maybe even just one and you&#039;ll be agreeing with me.<br /><br />HC, mate, brother, you have a returning client in me. (Again and again and again.)<br /><br />10 / 10
