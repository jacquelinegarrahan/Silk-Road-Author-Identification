				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				DoctorFate,<br /><br />The reason the tutorial has to be downloaded is that it is a PDF. It&#039;s clean and well-formatted. If I were to post it on this thread, it would be a long, text-only spew, which would be hard to print out and follow. <br /><br />I&#039;m not selling it; I&#039;m giving it away. <br /><br />Happy Trails!<br />MedicineWoman

				Yeah this vendor was posting that same thing in any thread asking for btc help.&nbsp; I can only guess they are attempting to phish us or infects our pc&#039;s.&nbsp; There are plenty of great guides already here and on youtube, and on a bunch of clearnet sites.&nbsp; They claim their pdf has pictures that make it easy and thats why they don&#039;t post it here.&nbsp; I would be weary of any user with a female user name, as a gamer I know these are the craziest people female or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />They actually responded to me in this thread, hilarious stuff...<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161864.msg1156188#msg1156188<br /><br />Let me make his clear, I don&#039;t have a problem with women, I like women, but in my experiences people with user names of a feminine nature are always fucking nuts.

				Whatever you do stay away from Medicinewoman and her vendor site...<br /><br />she asks for you name and address &quot;exactly as it appears on a letter&quot;...so she can send you a url to download her guide...<br /><br />Question...what in the hell does she need your name and address for that...?<br /><br />Then she tells you to access her download site outside of tor...what the hell...?...so she can snag your real IP...and already has your real name and address...<br /><br />Nice...now you are ensnared in a Law Enforcement operation...

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
