				Recently bought some MDMA which arrived quickly with godo stealth but was total crap.<br />Both myself and a friend did 100mg out clubbing then another 100mg 1 1/2 hours later as was feeling nothing.<br />Between us we have many 10&#039;s of year expereince so know good gear from crap.<br />The stuff had no smell, no usual taste, no come up, no euphoria; very limited effect to keep you awake for an extra couple of hours!<br />The vendor thread, which i cannot post in as I do not have enough posts, had some good reviews a while ago, and nothing much recently, the one or 2 on there are being pilot and saying they had no real effect but blamming themselves with mixing and doing 2 nights in a row, etc...<br /><br />If i take it to resolution the seller has made it clear they will refute what I am saying.<br />My buying rating is low as i am new.<br /><br />what shall i do?<br />I assume if i go to resolution, i will losse, will i then have a bad rating as a buyer or a mark against me so other sellers will not want to deal with me?

				That sucks. Not much you can do except tell us who the vendor was so that they get less business and think about stocking some real MDMA for a change.

				yeah, so when i get my posts up to 50 i will be going to his thread and leaving a bad review.<br />Not sure what to do on the finalising purchase though.<br /><br />If i finalse now i could leave him 1/5 and state product is crap.<br />What will he then do to me? is there a buyer rating? will other sellers then not want to sell to me?<br /><br />If a leave and open a resolution centre and ask for a refund, he will just say no.<br />What happens then, do i get a chance to rate him still as 1/5?<br /><br />Has anyone been to resolution?

				as your the buyer and in complete power as the seller is shipping first try resolve the issue with him first, if he does not agree to send better products or take his products back maybe u ship it on to a different address for him etc anything then i would go into resolution your a buyer it may effect ur feedback but will effect his much more then yours if you left him bad reviews
