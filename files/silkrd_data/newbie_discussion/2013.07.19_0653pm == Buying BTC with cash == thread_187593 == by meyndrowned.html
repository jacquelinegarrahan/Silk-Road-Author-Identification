				Precautions could be taken when you know the Bitcoins will be for illegal transactions.<br /><br />Your payment method for buying Bitcoins is cash, which is not anonymous to start off with. If anything were to happen to you (better be safe than sorry), you could cover yourself up by having a deposit address that cannot directly be linked to you. The anonymity of Bitcoins is not automatically made by the current implementation due to every transaction being logged and it being available for anyone. <br /><br />Personally, I would (1) send my coins to an eWallet service I trust (Blockchain in my case), (2) throw it into a mixing service and (3) finally send it to my main wallet. This is a basic way of anonymizing Bitcoins.

				The above is good advice, also I generate a new address for each transaction, both on SR and in my wallet.

				If one sends coins straight to SR and generates a new wallet address afterwards, then that seems pretty safe to me. Or do you think it would be somehow possible to track the transactions?<br /><br />I guess, if law enforcement would gain access to your SR account, because you for example keep your login details in unencrypted file, then they could find out your wallet address. But in this case there would be a lot of other incriminating evidence also..<br /><br />Then again, I only do such a small transactions that I doubt that it would make much sense for the police to try track me down.

That being said though, you can can never be to careful. So, do it anyway :)

				I like to send them through a fog but it really shouldn&#039;t matter. How would they link anything to your a specific address?

				Using bitcoin over a VPN or Tor (or both) is generally a good idea, because bitcoin is NOT anonymous in any way.<br /><br />Bitcoin network architecture sucks, honestly.<br /><br />There are experimental alternative blockchain-based cryptocurrencies (aka, altcoins, such as litecoin) that have a completely different network design.<br /><br />Some altcoins are designed to be used exclusively over Tor, I2P, and other pseudonymous or totally anonymous P2P overlay networks. These altcoins are not as widely accepted or popular as bitcoin, however.<br /><br />There are also non-blockchain cryptocurrencies that can be used over Tor, such as OpenTransactions or Ripple.<br /><br />Ripple and OT servers can be operated over Tor as hidden services, federated with other Tor hidden services, and gatewayed to non-Tor (clearnet) servers the same way TorMail does.<br /><br />For those not familiar with TorMail, Tormail uses disposable proxies that accept incoming connections from clearnet email servers and forward them over Tor to internal Tor hidden services located on a secret server farm somewhere.<br /><br />I have detailed design specifications and schematics on how to design a high-performance Tor hidden service, though Tor&#039;s hidden service design is a major single point of failure and bottleneck.<br /><br />Tor&#039;s hidden service design is incompatible with most load-balancing and high availability techniques used with clearnet websites. This is partly due to failures in HTTP itself and the web in general, but many of the limitations are imposed by Tor itself.
