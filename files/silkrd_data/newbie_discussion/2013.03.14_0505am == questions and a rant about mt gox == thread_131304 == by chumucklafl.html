				The same thing happened to me on gox but you should be able to change the pw though you&#039;ll have to wait 24 for that.&nbsp; I think as long as you don&#039;t submit the order in your cart, nothing will happen.&nbsp; Try going to your orders page and see if it&#039;s there for you to click cancel.

				I have had password problems with Gox as well. Luckily I didn&#039;t get locked out, but fuck Mt. Gox now, account verification bullshit.
