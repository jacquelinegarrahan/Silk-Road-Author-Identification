				Personally I would just throw down the money to order domestic. If you are ordering often enough that it makes that much of a dent in your wallet then you are using too often IMO. And if you&#039;re selling then ordering larger amounts internationally sounds like a bad time.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I ordered domestic from MyHigh approximately a month ago. Product received in heat sealed bag. The tracking option was offered to me and the letter arrived in 3 days.<br />I had to FE because that was my first order on SR. But MyHigh is a very polite and professional seller, good and quick communication. Will order again.<br /><br />NOW the product :<br /><br />white/grey, good looking, small rocks and powder. I took around 200mg in one night, and fuck me I was so fucking high... body reacted to the sound very well :) feeling like a cotton cloud around me, a bit fuzzy, lot of empathy, euphoria.<br />Side effects were normal, but it depends very much of your mood when you open your eyes and your brained feels like an anvil..<br />I had 3 or 4 friend testing it, review was unanimous : It is strong product.<br /><br />But for now it seems he is out of product, plus facing computer hacking issues...<br /><br />MyHigh when you are back, please let us know !<br /><br />Turk
