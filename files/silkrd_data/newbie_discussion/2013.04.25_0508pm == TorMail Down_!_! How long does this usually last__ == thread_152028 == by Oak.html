				I was actually just going to put a thread on this as well.<br />I am new to tormail, but it seems like a long time for that to be down.<br /><br />I know that there&#039;s nothing we can do but wait and I&#039;m sure that they&#039;ve had a ton a people contacting them about the email not working....but does anybody have any information on what may be going on with it?<br /><br />Also, what is the longest amount of time that tormail has been down??

				This has been over two days now. When SR was attacked they let us know exactly what was going on. I wish tormail admins had the decency to give us an update. I&#039;ve contacts coinapult and bitinstant about my coins, no response yet.
