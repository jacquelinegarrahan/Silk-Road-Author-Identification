				This is still just speculation,<br />The drop in BTC has upset the people who wanted the product sold, <br />OZHIGH LOST&nbsp; a lot of BTC value&nbsp; with this crash. <br />None of my messages have not been even opened, not normal for him.<br />does any one else&nbsp; make contact&nbsp; since last Friday night <br />there was a murder last Friday night on the Goldcoast&nbsp; <br />The same man was beat in front of his family 3 month before the same time the last BTC crash was.<br />that was also on the tv as well. <br /><br />just speculation <br />big business works this way you fuck up once you get a hell of a beattin the second time you fuck up your dead right. <br /><br />

				This has a bit of info on the murder victim. <br /><br />http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/07/07/454177_crime-and-court-news.html<br /><br />I very much doubt it&#039;s OZHIGH. But here&#039;s me hoping it&#039;s not either. That dude is a legend.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: This seems to be more updated. http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/07/08/454204_crime-and-court-news.html

				Eastenders now THERE is a soap opera set that saw its fair share of quality coke.<br /><br />Moksha and Gus can attest.....<br /><br /><br />When your central nasal passage completely erodes from too much coke and crack, leaving you with one massive nostril, your doing it right.....

I had a half gram over the weekend and had a blast. I posted a small review in his review thread if you&#039;d like to check it out: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174475.0<br /><br />Not the best coke I&#039;ve had but for the price it&#039;s an absolute bargain. I recommend it mate.

				In business, you do not get beaten up if you fuck up.

				Thanks aussiepp<br /><br />And congratulations to OZ for still being alive!<br /><br />Just shows you that some people got nothing better to do than make up things just to pass the time.<br /><br />The only thing I make up is my work time sheet. Were it says &#039;how many hours have worked&#039;, I make it all up.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />
