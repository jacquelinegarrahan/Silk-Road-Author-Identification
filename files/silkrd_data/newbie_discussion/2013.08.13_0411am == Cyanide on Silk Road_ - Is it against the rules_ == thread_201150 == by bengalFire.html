				Hey,<br /><br />I was browsing and I saw this listing for cyanide. I thought it was a bit strange, so I searched some more, and found another seller selling it<br /><br />Now I have to ask, isn&#039;t this against SR regulations? Cyanide is pretty much just a weapon, unless you&#039;re planning to &quot;Clean impurities from gold and silver&quot; or some other strange usage listed by the vendors. Of course, you can kill someone with heroin too, but cyanide is one of the main things we think of when it comes to poisons.<br /><br />Also in the DPR introductory message &quot; and don&#039;t do anything to hurt or scam someone else.&quot;<br /><br />Idk, I&#039;m not sure I like the idea that any random person can anonymously purchase cyanide off the web<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br /><br />Btw, here are the listings <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/search_results/cyanide

				Cyanide typically is not useful for killing other human beings only because it is detectable and typically they will know it&#039;s you upon further investigation.<br /><br />You would have to be very cunning to get away with using it. I&#039;d say cyanide is more for killing yourself and that is something I believe is a choice everyone should be allowed to make.<br /><br />Would you rather someone slashes their throat and goes out in a shroud of pain and regret or loses conciousness immediately and dies peacefully with no mess for anyone to clean up?

				Why not sell it to people.&nbsp; It is a chemical with many uses.&nbsp; <br /><br />We should all be chemists.

				Cyanide is the least of your concerns. Have you heard of scopolamine? That shit is insane.

				lol alright. Maybe it&#039;s just because I recently saw the movie Ice Man where the guy went around killing peeps by spraying that shit in their face<br /><br />Good point about killing yourself. Eating a cyanide sandwich is a lot easier than pulling the trigger, or making the leap. Also it makes less of a mess.

				You shouldnt trust everything you see on mythbusters. Cyanide is a very effective choice and causes one to essentially fall into a coma and die
