				My friend returned from Woodstock (late August 1994) with thousands of large white pills ...Quaaludes. He got us to take them and remain seated on the couch for an hour before getting up but unable to walk; at first there was a feeling of paralysis, but not a scary one, then came a long blackout from which all I can recall is people later telling me how much of a fool I became. He gave me a bag full and told me to tell people they were &quot;like acid&quot; at $5 a hit...&nbsp; The first place I took them was a house full of skids drinking and smoking and once the &#039;ludes came on, everybody was barfing all over the place. The owner kicked us out and we spent the night staggering around the streets. It was pouring rain; at one point I remember lying on the road drinking puddle water. I don&#039;t know how the cops missed us because we were so obviously fucked up. I believe I consumed 14 pills over the course of the first 24 hours. Apparently I brought them to school... some things I recall is staggering around the halls embarrassing myself and watching teachers and police searching for me in the smoking section after a couple girls had collapsed in class so I took off and just stopped going to school... terrible terrible experience

				Qualudes, or Mandrax as they were called in the UK, are a great drug but very difficult to get hold off. A brief timeline is shown below:<br /><br />1955 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone was first synthesized in India by M.L. Gujral and was soon being marketed as a non-addictive sleeping pill. 1/&nbsp; <br />1960 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone is sold by the Boots company under the names Melsed and Melsedin and by Marck as Renoval. 1/ <br />1965 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone is sold by Roussel labs in combination with an antihistamine under the name Mandrax. 1/&nbsp; <br />Late 60s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone becomes a commercial success in the United States where it is sold under the name Quaalude. It also becomes a popular street drug. 1/ <br />1971 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone becomes regulated in Britain under the UK Misuse of Drugs Act due to its increasing popularity as a recreational drug.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />1973 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone is placed in Schedule II in the United States making it difficult to prescribe and illegal to possess without a prescription.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Early 80s &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone is withdrawn from the market in Britain due to its addictive qualities.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />1984 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methaqualone is moved to Schedule I in the United States, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />1/ Reference: Rudgley R. &quot;The Encyclopaedia of Psychoactive Substances&quot; by Thomas Dunne Books, 1998.<br />&nbsp;Basically the only country that manufactures and markets them is South Africa, although I expect a few smaller labs are working on it!<br /><br />And to think that I had a prescription for Mandrax, to help me sleep, from a private doctor in Brixton Lane(???) South London, before it was banned. What great Friday nights we used to have, it wasn&#039;t called Randy Mandies for nothing - LOL :)<br /><br />&nbsp;Have never met a vendor IRL with over 30 years of looking although there are quite a few scammers out there, including the ones on SR, so unless they come from South Africa and have all the correct packing, patients leaflet etc, then forget it.<br /><br />I expect the upcoming generation of young &quot;research&quot; chemists to take another look at this drug, as its potential for making money is vast if manufactured in bulk&nbsp; and it does not cost a great deal to acquire the necessary precursors. <br /><br />There is a stack of information about&nbsp; it out there - try using &quot;startpage&quot; and see for yourself. Good luck people! :)

				Sad to hear this is the case. I&#039;ve been wanting to try them for a number of years and knew they were virtually impossible to get in the US, but I had no idea how rare they were in the rest of the world.<br /><br />You&#039;d think Mexico would have them...

				Growing up in the 70&#039;s , I remember going furniture shopping with my mom and her friend, both on ludes. My mom kept falling asleep on all the beds and her friend wasn&#039;t much better. The salesman threatened to call the cops. My dad had to leave work(yes,only one parent had to work back then) and come get us. We were there for hours. That&#039;s all I really know about them. I never ran across any in my travels.

				We used to smoke ludes when I was in high school. The taste was probably similar to smoking a styrofoam cup, but a quarter of a lude in a bowl of weed would get three or four teenagers stoned on their asses, so more economical than swallowing them. Quaaludes were stamped with the number 714, so this was a common drug reference for kids to scrawl on walls and notebooks and such, and also popped up in popular media sometimes- I&#039;m remembering a scene from one of the Cheech and Chong movies where they&#039;re visiting an apartment or hotel room or something and the room number is 714.<br /><br />O, I&#039;m feeling all nostalgic now! Also, there were of course no iPods or even compact discs, and stoners brought am/fm cassette boomboxes to school and just carried them around all day with music blasting for all to enjoy, or not enjoy. Also, weed cost $40 an ounce. And you were allowed to smoke cigarettes at school, as long as you had a signed permission form from your parents, so there was a &quot;smoking area&quot; at school where before school and at lunch one could find 75 or 100 kids getting stoned and blasting rock music. We would bring enormous bongs to school in paper grocery sacks and just fire away in the ol&#039; smoking area. Christ, certainly can&#039;t imagine anything like that at a public high school these days. Sigh...

				Remembering some more things about my experience with those large white pills with &quot;lemon&quot; printed on one side and &quot;500&quot; on the other that I was selling for $15 a pill (not $5 as claimed earlier) that were widely distributed at Woodstock &#039;94 and rumored to have originated from a lab in Texas operated by the Pagans or Banditos (I forget which one they said it was)
