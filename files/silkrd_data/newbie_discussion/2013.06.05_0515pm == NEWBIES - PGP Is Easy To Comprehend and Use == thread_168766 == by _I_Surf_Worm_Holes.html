				Since I have recently came into this community, I have read considerable accounts of people appearing to have difficulty in understanding the utilization of PGP. I have wondered to my self &quot;why do I read about so many people troubled with PGP on the SR Forum when I do not read about anyone there having problems generally using their TOR browser bundle?&quot; Acquiring, installing, and using a program designed to utilize the PGP protocol is no more difficult than doing so with your Tor browser bundle - that which most probably brought you here in the first place.<br /><br />Along of march to 50 posts, I decided to start a thread aimed at people who may feel confused by PGP.<br /><br />At the beginning, what I wish to say to you is this:<br /><br />generally speaking... PGP IS VERY SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND USE. <br /><br />There is a literal tonne of information about PGP on this site alone. Otherwise, check the search engines that you are comfortable with. May I recommend startpage.com for the clearnet? youtube it if you have to. <br /><br />Find a PGP program that fits your computer - is it Windows, Mac, etc... 32 bit, or 64 bit...<br /><br />Install that program just as official documentation prescribes... <br /><br />If you have a problem, isolate it. Research a fix for it (are you typing in the right command in bash? Or perhaps you should copy and paste someone&#039;s public key to a .asc file so that you can import their key into your keying... etc...) and then carry on with your merry business.<br /><br />You got this. It&#039;s like riding a bike. Easy as Sunday Morning. <br /><br />

				Do you know how to prevent PGP from putting its version and thus giving up its OS?
