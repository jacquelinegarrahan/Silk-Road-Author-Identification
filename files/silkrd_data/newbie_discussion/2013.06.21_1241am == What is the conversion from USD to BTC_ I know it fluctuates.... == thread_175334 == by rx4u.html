				&nbsp;Hi im new to SR, but i think i have found a new home. I plan on coming here often now, and cannot wait to start buying/selling. <br /><br />Ive done some research on how to turn my cash into btc, and i think i have found my method unless a better one shows up. Im just going to start with the netspend cards and trade them for btc. <br /><br />anyways. i know the value of bitcoin fluctuates daily, but i dont know where to go to keep track of this information? any good recommendations? <br /><br />the pricing seems a little confusing to me, but with your help im sure ill understand in no time. <br /><br />for instance, ive been browsing a vendor and had a few items peek my interest. could someone kind of walk me through the pricing scale / how it works?<br /><br />heres one:<br /><br />50x 2mg Xanax bars&nbsp; &nbsp; ฿1.13 <br /><br />...so i know that is 100mg of xanax but, how much is &quot;฿1.13&quot;?&nbsp; and then shipping is&nbsp; &quot; ฿0.22 &quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;so total thats ฿1.35<br /><br />how does this translate to USD?

				At the top of SR, click on ACCOUNT, next page, far right, click on SETTINGS and change it to USD. It will change all of the price displays to USD, with the exception of shipping, which will always be in BTC. Rather than worry about doing conversion rates in my head for the shipping, I just assume to add $10 to my order unless it&#039;s something crazy. <br />

				hey - the actual cost of the product to you in USD depends on what you paid for the bitcoin when you bought it, not the exchange rate when you buy the product - I only made one buy so far and I paid the https://mtgox.com/ Weighted Average (top right of page) when I purchased - I think it&#039;s quite common for bitcoin vendors to use this rate

				Cool, thanks guys for the prompt and informative answers. I&#039;m sure this is common knowledge, however I couldn&#039;t find a concise answer using the search function of the forums. It&#039;s only my 2nd here on this side of the web, and 1st day on the SR. I look forward to doing business with some of you!
