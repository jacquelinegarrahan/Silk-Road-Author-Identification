				*************************ATTENTION*********************************************<br /><br />After doing almost 1k in orders my very first day I have decided to raise prices a little bit (just to offset the free shipping).<br /><br />I will be doing this once i process the last few orders so you have about a hour or so to get your order in at this extremely low promotional price :) Packing these orders makes me extremely happy, not because im getting paid, but because I LOVE this weed and watching it all go into packages for you SR&#039;s to enjoy makes me SO HAPPY. I put so much time and love into my process and having happy plants and happy customers makes me SUPER happy&nbsp; 8) ::) :) :) :) :)

				Order&#039;s placed 6/11 have been packed and will ship in the AM!!!<br /><br />Im very pleased to announce that the first orders will be arriving at some locations tomorrow 6/12 (technically today, its 2am!, you guys got me SLAVING AWAY :)<br /><br />It has been a really exciting first few days and I wanted to thank all of you for your support. I&#039;ve sold through almost half my crop and that was without any feedback at all!!!! I have removed my promotional pricing structure now that some feedback should be in by tomorrow night from a few users. Unfortunately it appears I cannot edit the title, so it still states my promo pricing, but I have adjusted the BTC value. I apologize for any confusion that it causes and am waiting to hear back from vendor support. <br /><br />I have vastly improved my packing and shipping skills these past few days and simply cannot trim fast enough to keep up with the sales volume. <br /><br />Looking forward to all your reviews over the next few days!

				Please restock soon! Received in two days. Top notch stealth. I forget what strains I have, I think Deadhead and I forget the other, canyon or base jumper or something like that? The listing isn&#039;t active so I can&#039;t see the details. They look, smell and taste amazing. Definitely top quality marijuana. Anyway, trying the Deadhead right now. Mmmmm nice. It comes on pretty easy, nice strong stone, slightly more body intensive than heady, but, no anxiety noted so far from smoking a bowl (sometimes the heavy sativas give me anxiety/panic if I have too much). It&#039;s definitely got my PTSD in check.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Hope you more crops on the way! Best Regards.
