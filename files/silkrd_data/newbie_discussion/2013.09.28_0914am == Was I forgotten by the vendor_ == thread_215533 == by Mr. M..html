				Uh, it&#039;s me again.<br />So after Jannis said that it&#039;s impossible to ship to Belarus and Russia for the time being I went looking for the alternatives, and stumbled upon Alaska.<br />So I asked them if they&#039;re okay with shipping to me and after 5 days got a response that &quot;I&#039;d be welcomed if I FE&quot;.<br />Well, looks reasonable, I thought, I&#039;m new and have no history after all, gotta earn that trust somehow.<br /><br />And once again I ordered the acid, this time finalizing early (somewhat ~5 hours after placing the order).<br />And now it&#039;s been 9 days since I FEd and there wasn&#039;t a single message about the envelope. And don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;ll never bug a vendor about the delivery if the vendor reassures me that he did his job, which IS the problem this time - I did what I was asked to do and, well, I hoped that I&#039;d at least get a &quot;it&#039;s sent&quot; as a message.<br /><br /><br />Am I panicking for nothing and it&#039;s actually fine? I just don&#039;t know how it&#039;s supposed to be since I was forced to FE because I&#039;m new, otherwise there&#039;d be no shipment.<br /><br />And again, don&#039;t get me wrong. I don&#039;t want to look like some omg-I-got-scammed guy, I just want to know if it&#039;s fine asking the one who you order from for reassurance. Because the guy(s) have been online a couple of times in these last 9 days and over that time I sent him 5 messages which were never read. No, not the whiny ones you might think. Or maybe I&#039;m thinking for others too much.

				you should never FE. once you FE there is no way to resolve the order with the help of SR admin.<br />unfortunately you&#039;re on your own now. just looked and saw Alaska is active today. he has a great rating and a lot of transactions. leave a message in the discuss section on his vendor page and see what happens.<br />also you have to consider international shipping can take more then 14 days sometimes. people usually hit resolve b4 the auto-finalise and extend the days for the order to come.<br />good luck.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the reply.<br /><br />Well I know FE should never be done, but I had no options this time.<br />Thanks for suggesting to post in discuss section, I&#039;ll try.<br />And there&#039;s no problem with the shipping itself, as I said I&#039;d never even say anything to a vendor about it because I know the delivery can be unpredictable. I&#039;d wait for a month if I had to, I just want to know that there&#039;s no problem on the vendor&#039;s end.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m off to see if I can get his attention. :\
