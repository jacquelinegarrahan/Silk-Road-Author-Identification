				I don&#039;t know how much experience you all have had with psychedelic experiences but the more I think about it the more intense my recent experience becomes for me. So I have decided to share the parts of it that are really intriguing me. If you happen to be able to help me on my spiritual journey&nbsp; then I would appreciate any advice you could give me. Thank you for bearing with me. <br /><br />I have just made a revelation in my life and lost it as soon as it came. I was recently considering ordering some acid. This made me think about the last time/first time I took acid. I have had some intense trips using mushrooms but nothing that seemed as truly spiritual as this lsd trip. During the process of remembering my trip, I stumbled on a memory I did not know I had. I remembered something profound and life changing. Through some process, I remembered that during my last trip I had realized that I had been lying to myself. The lie itself was superfluous. However, as I remembered it the realization that what I had told myself for so long was a lie was liberating in the best sense of the word. Sadly, the first moment of realization is lost in a sea of intense emotion from being my first foray into lsd. In addition, the second memory of this realization is clouded because during the experience I was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana. Now I feel empty knowing what it feels like to be completely honest, utterly empty, and to experience existence the way it was meant to be without the lies. The only problem is I am at this moment completely unaware of what lies I am actually telling myself. All memory of these lies except for their profound effect on my life has been lost to me. Any advice on how to remedy my situation would be appreciated.

				Lsd in my opinion is one of the most. if not the most spiritual experience out there. i think it literally opens up passages in your mind. but can close them as well. i guess it just depends on what wave you catch and how well you ride it:)

				Dropped 650ug of acid on friday. My balls were tripping off for about 10 hours. Dunno if it was spiritual, but I vividly recall being thirsty as fuck, but not understanding that my water was within arms reach all along. I didnt think it was real, but then realized that the oasis was reality and that I was in control of all the water on the planet. I then played a chapter of &quot;The Last of Us&quot; and it was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. <br />Great trip ;)

Or read up on &#039;ego loss&#039;, which is maybe what happened to you in some degree. Read the avengers LSD thread on here, there has been some talk of this fairly recently and discussion of how to achieve it. I have had some life altering experiences on LSD, and felt stronger connections to the collective consciousness.&nbsp; If you want to stop the lies you are telling yourself, start exploring in your sober life and take your next trip with the intention of exposing these lies&nbsp; once and for all.

				Will never touch it again. Did alot in high school. Had some really great experiences, but towards the end i just wound up praying to the sun-god to come up because that would mean sleep was in sight and bad trip in the rear-view mirror.

				LSD is about making connections between things.&nbsp; A pun is funny because it makes a certain connection between two things.&nbsp; If a pun made connections between five or six things in a really funny way, that would be psychedelic.&nbsp; Explaining why it&#039;s funny to someone who doesn&#039;t get it doesn&#039;t make it funny however.<br /><br />When acid hands you these multidimensional life/reality puns, sometimes it&#039;s funny (sometimes quite hilarious) but it can also render other emotions.&nbsp; Awe.&nbsp; Astonishment.&nbsp; Delight.&nbsp; And then those emotions that fail words.&nbsp; Tears streaming down your cheeks.&nbsp; <br /><br />I rather suspect your insight wasn&#039;t &quot;lost in&quot; the emotion.&nbsp; It was the emotion.&nbsp; There&#039;s a rhythm to these things, between emotion and semantics.&nbsp; You dream and then you meet with your analyst to figure out what it all means.&nbsp; &nbsp; The essence of the thing isn&#039;t the dream or the interpretation, it&#039;s neither the emotion nor the words.&nbsp; You do one and then the other.&nbsp; You learn to roll with the rhythm.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing you need to understand about psychedelics in general, and acid in particular, is that it&#039;s about helping you understand how things are connected.&nbsp; Dogen once said the universe is like a spider web with a drop of dew at each intersection.&nbsp; Any given dewdrop is reflected in all the others, and bears the reflections of all the others.&nbsp; Once you see how everything is connected, that&#039;s it.&nbsp; You win!&nbsp; But don&#039;t forget, you&#039;re in it.&nbsp; You&#039;re one of those dewdrops, get it?<br /><br />One of the implications of this sort of mysticism is that it doesn&#039;t support morality.&nbsp; &nbsp;(The basis of morality is the distinction between the creature and its Creator, and mystical philosophies don&#039;t endorse such a distinction; or to put a finer point on it, they look at it as the first lie we tell ourselves.&nbsp; Freud would likely agree, Klein would agree up to a point.)&nbsp; So you need to remember that, as far as acid is concerned, what you&#039;re feeling and observing in yourself is a reflection of the universe the way it is.&nbsp; It&#039;s not meant to cull you out for shame or recrimination.&nbsp; <br /><br />tl/dr:&nbsp; it&#039;s not that you learned something about yourself, it&#039;s that you learned something about reality.&nbsp; Including yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t sweat it.&nbsp; Congrats, you realized the Hindus were right.&nbsp;

				solid post, henry.&nbsp; <br />In my experiences with LSD and mushrooms, I always saw mushrooms as the more spiritual entheogen.&nbsp; I am not saying that LSD does not have this property, but I feel that psilocybin submits the user to a spiritual experience.<br />LSD offers the opportunity to traverse the spiritual conscience, but the user must be motivated and guided to achieve said experience.&nbsp; <br />In order to achieve true, unbiased reflection of your past, I would propose a larger than average dose of psilocybin.&nbsp; I agree with Henry when he says that you should go into the LSD experience with a goal.

				The trips where you realize you are telling yourself a lie, aka delusion, aka reality distortion field, can be bad. The lie is probably not something insignificant.

I picked something I needed to change about myself and focused on it before and throughout my trip. What&#039;s amazing to me is&nbsp; the LSD guided me through my spirit, my consciousness, every memory I&#039;ve ever had. It did this in instant flashes. I felt the &quot;death of ego&quot; and it&#039;s rebirth. I understood myself on a cellular level and the parts as a whole. knew I was under the hood of &quot;me&quot;. Maybe try lsd at night with no distractions, some low level warm lighting and some good music while making it a priority of the trip to uncover these hidden truths. <br />Good luck....

It just always seemed like when I was tipping that any attempt to focus my thoughts was like trying to swim upstream. My mind races from thought to thought and any attempt to slow it down or stop it produced bad vibrations. It was like I was trying to fight the drug. Is it possible that meditation if done properly could avoid this unwanted side effect?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I rather suspect your insight wasn&#039;t &quot;lost in&quot; the emotion.&nbsp; It was the emotion.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This actually makes a lot of sense.

One of the few things I remember about the experience was the realization that the lie was completely insignificant. So much so that I questioned why I had ever started lying in the first place. I realized that my life would be no better or worse off without the lie except for the inner peace gained through being honest with myself.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				I have to say LSD changed the way I think entirely. After my first trip I felt like I had so much more clarity in my life. Like someone had given me the answer to everything. A lot of time has gone by since then and I feel as though I&#039;ve lost that. I suppose that just means it&#039;s time to take another trip&nbsp; :P
