				Wow man that sucks, but at least you got away clean! If you don&#039;t mind saying, how big of a quantity did you order? I always hear that CDs are only for bulk orders and feds wont bother with personal use so I&#039;m interested if that holds true for you as well.

				she picked up her shirt you said.&nbsp; what does that mean?&nbsp; Mikey left where at 2?&nbsp; I think you&#039;re saying Mikey was on his normal route but he didn&#039;t show up to your house?&nbsp; Do you live in a house where you can see the mailman slowly driving by from one house to the next?&nbsp; What I mean is if you have neighbors the mailman would have delivered mail to them today so did you see him?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I saw in your other thread you ordered from the Netherlands.&nbsp; This is why I just do domestic only.&nbsp; That could be a big reason why someone showed up.&nbsp;

				at this point i think its probably pointless to ask him anything. he&#039;s either arrested and his computer is now evidence... or he&#039;s crazy as hell and just refused his product for no reason, destroyed his computer, burned his house to the ground and fled to the woods to reconnect with nature. either way, i dont think he&#039;ll be around any more to answer incriminating questions

				I have the impression that it is already too late.<br /><br />Too many info in that post. It was too easy to do 2 + 2.<br /><br />People should really beware on the details they post. I can understand helping the community with the most specifics, but not to the point of the thing being detrimental for your security. Safety should always be at first place (and this is even for the community itself, not only on personal level).

				Getting a CD thrown out in court is very easy for all the reasons people have pointed out here. They only use the CD to get into your house and find other shit. Any good lawyer can get a CD thrown out for a number of reasons.<br /><br />The biggest give away was the mailman not being dressed like a mail man...and honestly, I think many of the people posting here are overreacting. If they didn&#039;t take your computer right then, then they probably won&#039;t. <br /><br />Local Law Enforcement does not have the manpower to hunt through some obscure online forum for some guy revealing evidence. SR is not the only place people can get drugs online, and on top of that people have been receiving drugs in the mail since the mail existed, long before SR even was thought about. <br /><br />Unless you&#039;re buying hundreds of pounds coke or insane quantities like that in single transactions, then it is highly unlikely a federal task force is going to comb the internet searching for evidence of you. Most small packages being received on SR(1-5lbs of product is small) are not worth the time of federal agencies, and they forward such cases to Local LEO. Local LEO don&#039;t have the man power, funding, or TIME to hunt the dark corners of the internet to catch some guy who ordered a couple of thousand dollars worth of drugs. <br /><br />For all I know OP did not even order that much.

				i believe that a controlled delivery is usually their method of obtaining a search warrant for the property so they can search for other illegal items inside the house.&nbsp; it should be easy enough to beat a case of just a package in the mail, but if theyve got you for a package in the mail and a half pound inside the house or an illegal firearm or whatever you may have laying around, well then theyve built a very substantial case.&nbsp;

				you don&#039;t sign for a package that has your name and address on it, but then goto the post office to get it.....you get arrested the next day....the proof is going to the post office asking for your package again.... no need to sign for it, they can just start monitoring you to see what else comes and build a case.....the guy was paranoid and just left his shit at the post office...lol.&nbsp;
