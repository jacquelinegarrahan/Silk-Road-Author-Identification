				Hi Guys,<br /><br />Tried LSD last weekend for the fist time. The blotters were bought from SR vendor lucydrop. They were advertised as 100ug per tab, so i figured one and a half tabs would be a good dose to discover the lands of LSD. <br /><br />It absolutely blew my mind. I had a great time for the most part, although the trip was way more intense than i expected. The visuals were craaaazy, also the mind trip was very strong. Went to the point where time stopped existing, and my person, &#039;I&#039;, stopped existing as well. And to be honest I experienced this as pretty scary. At the time it felt like an eye opener, a secret about the &#039;truth&#039;, the working behind things so to speak. But i didn&#039;t like this truth, and I was sad that my life I thought was real was over. Even blacked out for a bit I think, can&#039;t recollect what happened for a period.<br /><br />Compared to other trip reports that report on doses around 150ug, my reaction to LSD seems a bit strong. Is it possible that some people are more sensitive than other to LSD? Or was the dose higher than advertised? (advertised as WOW, received blotters with print)<br /><br />One other thing that came unexpected, took the dose at 14:30, the highest peak was around 17:00, and pretty quickly after this peak, around 18:00 or so, I came down very fast. Visuals died down a lot, was still mindtripping tho. Mindtrip stopped at around 20:00. So the whole thing took 5 hours, with visuals for 3 hours. I though LSD was a longer acting drug? Or can this be different per trip and per person?<br /><br />Thanks for reading and best to all of you&nbsp; :)

				Glad you had a fun time! It&#039;s not likely for a vendor to underestimate their dosage, so perhaps you are just naturally receptive to LSD. In which case grats - you&#039;ll have an awesome time and be able to spend less! ;)<br /><br />The activity of it tapers off, so the point you stop tripping is hard to define. For me, I&#039;ll be at a peak from about 2.5 to 5 hours after dosing. After that point, music still sounds good, and the world is still bright and colourful and a bit wobbly, but I&#039;m no longer properly in the headspace or seeing OEV&#039;s. It&#039;s likely you were still above baseline after your fifth hour, for a few hours more, just nothing compared to your earlier peak. Put on some music next time, see if you hear more detail than usual ;)

				Yeah things were &#039;different&#039; for a while longer, tried browsing the internet after the trip but had a hard time reading anything, looked like magnifying glasses were moving over the screen the whole time. But this was indeed nothing compared to the peak, so I didn&#039;t experience this as tripping.<br />Funny that you mention the details in music, I noticed the last couple of days that music sounds different compared to before the trip, like the way I hear things changed a bit, indeed easier to hear detail, very enjoyable&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Didn&#039;t notice this on the trip itself, guess I was too occupied by the visual and mental effects of the LSD.

				I&#039;ve read and heard that good acid should keep visuals going for a long period of time 8+ hours. Personally I took three tabs that were advertised at 150ug and only tripped for about 4 hours before coming down hard. Everyone is different when it comes to drugs and their natural tolerances vary.

				So I&#039;ve had the weird thing happen where I can trip harder on less than I used to.&nbsp; The &quot;reverse tolerance,&quot; I&#039;ve seen it called?&nbsp; It&#039;s quite an economical deal!&nbsp; But I think it comes from the brain realizing &quot;how&quot; to trip, and essentially getting better at it.&nbsp; So OP will eventually need like 20 miks for blast off.<br /><br />

				Congratulations. You&#039;ve chemically unplugged from the matrix. Welcome to the other side. <br /><br />Now wipe the slime off and let&#039;s get to business. <br /><br />Kidding aside, it is a huge intellectual leap. I think it&#039;s harder to stomach at younger ages so that&#039;s part of it. <br /><br />I see your posts about death and yes that&#039;s a huge pre-requisite to LSD: you should be quite comfortable with your own mortality in the larger sense of it all.

				Hey,<br /><br />It seems that u&#039;r a lucky boy. I need around 200ug to have a nice trip. Stay safe with LSD, maybe you can try 1 blotter and see what&#039;s happening next&nbsp; ;)

				Sounds like my first trip. A real eye opener. Yet at the same time, I felt like I knew it all along and just needed the LSD to free my thoughts.

				It always amazes me just how much psychedelics can alter your sense of perception and&nbsp; the way you think in general. It certainly opened my eyes...

				WOW sounds like a swell time. <br /><br />My first trip was like that too, scary one moment and then energetic and fun the next. Then an eye opener when you become introspective whilst in the time tunnel.<br /><br />Waves of Heaven is how I think of it. AWESOME

				EGO DEATH!<br />Lol never experienced it for myself but ive definitely wandered down some strange mental roads while tripping. Hopefully your personality hasn&#039;t been terribly altered (that happens a lot after experiencing ego death) I always approach psychedelic use with an excited/positive/open minded attitude to avoid such things and so far that hasn&#039;t failed me. I always try to learn something knew from tripping too, having that as your trip goal can sometimes help. I find that a lot of people get confused when they trip, like they forget why they&#039;re tripping (for fun) or how to chill and have a good time with friends so i like to always have an introspective goal in the back of my mind incase i forget the purpose of my trip or something like that

				My first time using LSD I took 2 tabs of wow and smoked cannabis 1 hour after dosing and it had been 2 weeks since I had smoked.<br />I was so fucked up I felt like if someone tried to get my attention I felt like I wouldn&#039;t/couldn&#039;t respond probably for 10 seconds.<br />I tell everyone before they try LSD for their 1st time that it will be the most fucked up they&#039;ve ever been.&nbsp; 8)<br />

The bud gives you a head change that can set some people off the deep end if they aren&#039;t prepared. Like one kid i knew was frying with me and my friends and he was having a good time, but then he took a bong rip and was then convinced that nothing was real and he had to kill himself to get back to reality (we guided him out of this state of course and he didnt kill himself)

For example Shamans in the Amazon (the real ones, there are also of fakes, many in fact) need much much less than an usual person of Ayahuasca and they get much more intense effects.<br /><br />Even your unconscious can be trained, as a muscle. For example at this point I never use more than 5 mg of DMT to do what I have to do, while at the beginning I needed 50-60.<br /><br />EDIT: To explain the training. It is like a sort of post hypnotic suggestion, like a &quot;place and recall&quot;. When you pass certain barriers you can actually go there immediately with just a little &quot;boost&quot; (you can use a tune or a song or either a phrase to do that).

				I cant handle psychedelics unless Im already in a good mind space by having a strong dose of MDMA so Im already in bliss when the acid kicks in. I would not take LSD on its own again. Ive had bad trips and Im naturally a depressed and anxious person so Im unlucky to not enjoy what all you trippers out there can. MDMA combo is good though. I get visuals and music is better and just spaced out as hell. I wish I could enjoy acid cos I know how it brings music to a whole new level. <br />I had a massive dose of Mushrooms a few years ago (2008) and it freaked me the hell out. I thought I would never return to earth again. But even on that occasion as scared as I was I hid in my car from the evil world outside and played some Psytrance and it really helped me escape the hell that was evolving everywhere else. Nothing brings music to life more than psychedelics its just my personal mind cant take the craziness of everything else. <br />I have massive visuals on psychedelics. Im extremely sensitive and I always feel like the world is ending. Ive had 2CB with MDMA and it was amazing. Ive had Ketamine and was ok but not the same as true psychedelics. Salvia makes me so paranoid I can see no reason anyone would want to touch it. My days experimenting with psychedelics are done. Im just not the person who can do them. I love MDMA though and its almost psychedelic.
