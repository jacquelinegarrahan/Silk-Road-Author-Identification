				Has anyone drug tested / tried kwikemarts green bulls? Do you know for sure that it&#039;s MDMA? I&#039;ve tried them but I&#039;ve never done MDMA before trying these.<br /><br />Experienced Side Effects:<br />extreme mood lift<br />euphoria<br />slightly more talkative<br />strong increase in energy<br />feelings of comfort and belonging <br />giant football sized pupils<br />increased awareness<br />increased appreciation of music<br />felt like I loved everyone<br /><br />I also noticed that if you try to focus your eyes too much then instead of getting blurry it gets shaky. nystagmus?<br />It&#039;s weird. I can do this on command :P

				All those details point to nothing other than great MDMA! I decided to give kwikEmart a try and ordered 10 of his green bulls which just came in today. They taste like the real thing and are some of the best pressed pills Ive come across. You know they could be real when they taste sour/bitter. They feel chalky which is a good thing. From past experience, fake pills cut with piperazine tend to look waxy like candy, so these look genuine. I haven&#039;t tried them yet but will post my review once I do next week.&nbsp; ;D

				No green bulls...but I can say that XTC EXPRESS&#039; green grenades are some of the best on the road. Especially for the price.

I have a tolerance to MDMA/analogs. Consider that I weigh 80KG and I have rolled on 6 weekends in the past 8 weeks. The first 4 weekends I rolled on Methylone. The two most recent rolls were these past two weekends, in which I have rolled on MDMA. <br /><br />Two weekends ago I rolled on 300mg of crystal MDMA, I rolled for 6 hours INTENSE. But had a clean experience with no negative side effects such as jaw soreness. I am sure that this session increased my tolerance significantly, so no doubt the green bulls this past weekend did not hit me as strong as they should have. Anyways here is my experience with the green bulls this past weekend.<br /><br />1---(930pm) took 1 green bull. Had a noticeable mood uplift and visuals from lights were great. This roll hit me very mild but lasted over 2 hours (its effects stayed the same intensity level but would from time to time hit me harder, reminding me that I was rolling).<br /><br />2--(1130pm)--2 hours later I consumed 2 green bulls, which I chewed. I noticed its effects 20min into digestion. This had me rolling on a 7/10 scale. Not too hard of a roll but it had me feeling happier and with a sense of well-being and &#039;togetherness&#039; with my group. These two green bulls had me rolling for 3+ hours.<br /><br />3---(330am)-my 4th and last green bull was consumed 6 hours after my initial dose. This last green bull was also chewed and hit me within 20 minutes and lasted for 2+ hours with mild effects. Effects were mood elevation and a calm, relaxed state of being.<br /><br />No problems going to sleep<br />Mild teeth-grinding, no jaw muscle soreness the following day.<br />VERY clean roll.<br />Increased sexual arousal. <br />Noticeable empathetic feelings.<br />Increase in sociability.<br />Dilated pupils.<br /><br />I would recommend consuming 2 green bulls at first if you have a tolerance. Taking 2 will give you a GREAT roll that isn&#039;t too overwhelming. Overall a great pill for its content and price.<br />
