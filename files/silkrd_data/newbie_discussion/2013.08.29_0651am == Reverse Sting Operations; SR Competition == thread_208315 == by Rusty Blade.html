				Two somewhat related questions I was pondering this evening:<br /><br />1. If LE is trying to snag you via a reverse sting operation does it even matter whether they have the product they are listing?&nbsp; Is just ordering something that&#039;s advertised as an illicit substance on a site like SR enough to get your ass thrown in the hoosegow?<br /><br />2. Why would anyone who is familiar with SR and used it successfully ever switch to a competing site, given the risk involved and the fact that if I was LE I&#039;d be setting up vendor accounts like crazy on those other sites to undermine development of the level of trust prevalent on SR.&nbsp; Fuck, better yet just set up an entire competing site and dragnet the shit out of everyone who orders...<br /><br />Just wondering...

				1.&nbsp; Yes ordering something is conspiring.&nbsp; Proving you ordered it is a little more difficult though if you don&#039;t pick up the mail so that usually has to happen as well.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; People are willing to take risks for the things they want, that&#039;s why.&nbsp; Besides, can anyone truly say using SR is more or less risky than another site?&nbsp; They can point to anecdotal evidence that suggests it might be less risky but that&#039;s the best argument that can be made.&nbsp; You&#039;ll hear people spout off all the rationalizations they themselves make to their brains to feel more comfortable taking these risks but that doesn&#039;t make their logic sound.

				That&#039;s pretty much what I figured on #1.&nbsp; As far as #2 is concerned, I hear what you&#039;re saying generally, but I just can&#039;t imagine what another site might offer that would ever cause me to leave SR since I&#039;ve had a pretty successful run here so far.
