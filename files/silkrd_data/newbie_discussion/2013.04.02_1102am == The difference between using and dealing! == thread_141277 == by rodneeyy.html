				So if your house gets raided i know there is a fine line between he amounts of the product you have.<br /><br />For example if the DEA found 2g of weed that&#039;s not enough to convict you of &quot;intent to deal&quot;<br /><br />But does anyone know the amount you can have on you before you are charge with &quot;intent to deal&quot;?

				Completely depends on where in the world you are and on many circumstances surrounding the raid.<br />If the cops find 2g of bud, 500 empty baggies, some well worn scales and a tick list full of names and amounts of money owed, then intent to deal is a very probably charge. At the same time, possession of an ounce or too combined with a head of 3 foot long dreadlocks and playing bass in a reggae band could very easily, and rightfully be argued as personal possession. Totally depends on circumstances.<br /><br />You need to be clever about things like this if you want to deal, that you need to ask this question to a web forum indicates to me that you probably shouldn&#039;t be dealing

				Keep your stash whatever it is in ONE container.&nbsp; 2 g of weed in two bags is already intent to distribute.&nbsp; Now if you have a pound in one bag it will still look like your a dealer.&nbsp; But you can claim personal use.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have no scales or bags with your stash.&nbsp; Again this makes it look like it is personal.
