				Recently asked for a few free samples with an order, mainly the new&nbsp; C20 Diaz but ended up with a bag of one of everything! ;). Really appreciated it but I&#039;ve no idea what some of them are, can you help.?&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a 2mg white xanax bar and an older type xanax (1mg?)white triangle, straight forward enough. Then they were 2 pills, both with a split line through em but no other markings, one was orange in colour and the other was more pinkish - I presume these are the new C20 20mg diazepam from the C10 labs?&nbsp; Then there is an almost light grey/green and speckled blue colour one with TMZ stamped on the back (are these the 30MG Temaz from C10 labs)? Ive never seen one before.&nbsp; Then there is a light yellow pill just stamped XA on one side and a split line on the other, no idea what that is??? Also a plain white/light blue pill with no markings at all apart from the usual split line, again no idea what it is and a blue pill stamped 10mg on one side and the usual split line on the other, I&#039;m presuming its a diaz but from where or who I dont know.&nbsp; Already necked the xanax bar and blue val ;) I took pictures of them but cant figure out how to upload em, if any one can hep me out Id love to know.&nbsp; Cheers man.
