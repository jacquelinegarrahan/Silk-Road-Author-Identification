				He scammed you and a bunch of other people. Some of whom lost THOUSANDS of dollars, so I guess you got off easy.<br /><br />Honestly, I think everyone&#039;s been clear on why you should not FE wiht ANYONE, by now if you lost your money finalizing early it&#039;s as much your fault as the vendors.<br /><br /><br />Go in the rumor mill, check out his review thread, or just search for his username and you&#039;ll find a giant thread about people losing huge amounts of cash because they thought he was &quot;trusted&quot;

				This isn&#039;t even the first time you FE&#039;d? Escrow is there for a reason. Scammers would be broke if people on here didn&#039;t hrow their money away without thinking about it. You&#039;d think if you put in the effort to learn PGP/Tor etc. that you&#039;d at least try to understand the mechanics of SR and why going outside of escrow will always open you up to get fucked. Takes a special type of lazy/stupid.

				Try to really do your research when you choose a vendor. If you see a ton of FE&#039;s, you can come to a slight conclusion that he might be starting to scam. You then go further back to see if those FE&#039;s ever received their packages. I do not know your exact conditions, so this is advice for the future.

Finalising means what it sounds like it means: that the transaction has been concluded and both parties are satisfied. Silk Road cannot protect you when you decide to go around the safety that the escrow system provides.<br /><br />Libertas

Karma will come back on him though. and yes i know all about the mechanics of silk road some vendors ask for FE for small orders but he was just really trusted and i had ordered from him before. o well just trying to get my post count up and talk to my buddies on the SR. Much love you guys !

				I very nearly lost a Moneypak with a good amount on it. Luckily the money was still there on it the day he went AWOL and I was able to get it back. Moral of the story: if you see someone asking for FE en masse, it&#039;s a scam.

				I was watching this guys listings....What caught my eye was the negative reviews from the canceled orders where he wouldn&#039;t budge on his FE policy..His FE requirement wasn&#039;t disclosed on his vendor profile page.

				I should&#039;ve paid attention to his review thread on here because his feedback was good. I&#039;m jus glad I didn&#039;t take that leap. It wouldve turned me off for good
