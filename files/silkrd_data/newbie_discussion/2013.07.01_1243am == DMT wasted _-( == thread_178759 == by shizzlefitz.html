				For my first order of DMT (ordered .5g but got only .2) I made the following device:<br /><br />I took a 1 liter plastic bottle of soy sauce and cut the bottom off. I then took a metal lid from a jar that fit just right. On the lid I placed about a quarter of the spice I had, so eyeballed about 50mg. I then capped the lid to the bottom and held it in place with two sticky labels. I then used a lighter on the bottom.<br /><br />I expected it to fill up with smoke so I could unscrew the top and suck it in. Instead it just bubbled on the lid into a gooey yellow mess.<br /><br />What&#039;d I do wrong?<br />ps. wish there was a way to post a pic of my rig

				Oh, and the rest of the DMT, about 150mg, I snorted.<br /><br />Ouch!<br /><br />Felt like shit for the next 10 mins and no visuals.

				Have you done any research at all into smoking DMT? Sounds like you just melted it and it hasn&#039;t hit the vaporizing temp yet.

				Well I have done research on it - lots actually - but I haven&#039;t come across a lot about the mechanics of smoking. Only see lots of stuff about whether the machine is better than a genie and lots of course on what tripping is like.<br /><br />I understood that if it melted you&#039;re shit out of luck and that the goal is to sublimate the crystals. Please enlighten me.

				https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+smoke+dmt<br /><br />If using a glass pipe keep the flame from directly touching the glass, once the dmt begins to melt roll the pipe slowly in your fingers to evenly heat the bottom. When it starts smoking, exhale completely then slowly begin to inhale the smoke until you can&#039;t take in anymore. Put down the pipe and if you&#039;ve done it right you should blast off before you remember exhaling.<br /><br />Or sprinkle a bit on top of a bowl of weed. I have no idea what inspired you to try smoking out of a soy sauce container using a metal lid as the &quot;bowl&quot;. Get a real piece.<br /><br />Not trying to talk down to you, but this is smoking 101. DMT is not the easiest thing to smoke &quot;right&quot; but it sounds like you need to do a little more research.

				people swear by the machine, i didnt make one but i got a 2 liter bottle, rapped two layers of tinfoil with a bowl shape in the center of the bottom then took packing tape and put it around the top of the foil and the bottle i could slide the foil off and on easily, then i keep the lighter away from it by maybe an inch and let it fill up, when your ready, take the cap off, and i usually get about 2-3 hits off a 2liter bottle, you should keep that lid that has dmt on it still, ive went to use a pipe that was empty and got a few awesome breakthroughs off just the resin from the dmt, i know it looks ghetto, but whatever it works great so why mess with something that works fine, right? im not sure but if i happened to have a nice vape i use for bud, can i vape dmt in it and permanently make it a dmt vape?

				If you have the patience and access to the resources have you considered infusing the Freebase with certain leafs to make Changa? This is a lot easier for beginners to use as you can roll it in a nice spliff and take very slow long tokes for effect.<br /><br />Clearnet warning: https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=24592

				I do have a box vape, the kind you can get off ebay for $30, but don&#039;t really see a good way to use it for burning powder. I&#039;ve googled vape+dmt but don&#039;t get any good hits.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Vaping DMT is best, but I&#039;ve always had good effect by packing half a cone, sprinkling DMT, packing the other half, and applying minimum heat and taking it really slowly.

				The last (and first) time i got a g of dmt i struggled to get it to burn just right. Bought a good glass pipe, followed friends and internets instructions, just couldn&#039;t get it to blast me outta there. In the end i got the most enjoyable sessions with a bit of changa. I&#039;m looking forward to having another crack at it..

				Put it on weed or vape it in a crack pipe.<br /><br />Putting it on weed will waste more of it, but it works. It&#039;s the easiest way (if you already smoke weed), and it&#039;s how I usually smoke it when I have it.<br /><br />Vaporizing it is the &quot;best&quot; way, as in, you inhale most of what you put in the pipe. You need glass. Crack pipe/meth pipe/hash pipe/light bulb (for real, clean it out first).Put the powder in/on the glass, apply heat evenly to the glass. When it gets hot enough, you&#039;ll see the vapor rising (subliming) and that is what you inhale. It cools fast, so get it while it&#039;s hot. The burning on your lips is a good thing.
