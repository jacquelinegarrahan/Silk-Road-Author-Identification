				Hi Respect1!<br /><br />I cannot find a single review of your products here in the forum. maybe it`s, cause I`m not used to the forum, I don`t check here often. And if so, I only read.<br />So this is my first message in the forum -by the way-&nbsp; :).<br /><br />You made me a good special deal and I was very happy about it! But I still did not receive it! I bought from several dutch vendors, like Happy Timezz, and c63amg.<br />I always received there letters whitin three days. Now it`s six days, since you put my order in transit. And I`m quite sure, that it`s seized or lost.<br /><br />@people out there:<br />Now my question: Is there anybody out there who didn`t receive an order from Respect1? Maybe his stealth is not good...<br /><br />IMPORTANT: I don`t think, hes a scammer, cause he offered me 100% refund, if my order don`t arrive till Saturday , August 3rd.<br />But this will ruin my buyer stats&nbsp; :-[ :-[.<br /><br />I`d be happy, if anybody would share experience with buying and receiving from Respect1.<br />He is a friendly seller. But I suspect, his stealth is not good.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />MF81the1st

				Hi Respect1!<br /><br />I didn`t want to attac or insult you! It just never happened before, that an order inside EU took that long. That`s why I assume, it`s seized or lost.<br />I wrote the thruth, you offered me 100% refund, if it`s not here till tomorrow. So you are very korrect! And I didn`t wanted to disrespect you.<br />&nbsp;I am just interested in other peoples experiences with you. That`s why i asked here.<br />So I`ll update here tomorrow. <br />If it should arrive next week, I would tell u and pay for what I got!! But for now, I think nothing will arrive.<br />Blame on me, if I`m wrong and I got ass enough to tell, if it is so.<br /><br />Have a good evening everyone, it`s weekend now&nbsp; :) :)!<br /><br />Regards,<br />MF81the1st<br /><br /><br />

				Hey folks,<br /><br />I found an empty mailbox this morning and in the soon afternoon, when I was home, I asked Respect1 to refund, like he sayed he will. And he did! Imediately! It took about 10 minutes! He also told me to send me a free sample, once he build his buissnes. And I think, this mans word is gold. I think, he just does something wrong, maybe stealth or something with the adresses. I don`t know, but i know, he kept word in my case.<br /><br />@Respect1: I really wish you good luck for your buissnes, that was no ironic or something! I think, you got my pm wrong. I honestly wish you the best, since you`ve been correct to me.<br /><br />Regards,<br />
