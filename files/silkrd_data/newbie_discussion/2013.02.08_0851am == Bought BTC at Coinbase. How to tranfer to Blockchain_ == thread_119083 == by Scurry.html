				SO I finally found a place to buy BTC.. Coinbase.&nbsp; So I bought the 10 BTC that I was allowed.&nbsp; Now, how do I transfer that into my new wallet at Blockchain?&nbsp; And then, how do I transfer that into SR?&nbsp; I&#039;m reading a lot on Reddit but not finding answers to those questions.<br /><br />Any help is most appreciated!

				Does your Blockchain wallet have its own address? I&#039;m fairly sure you can just send money to that code and Coinbase will transfer it. Of course, you could also just directly send from Coinbase to your SR account as well, but if you&#039;re concerned about laundering your Cryptocurrency even further...

				So, then I should be able to send BTC from Coinbase to the BC wallet?&nbsp; I am on the coinbase site now, and it says PENDING.<br /><br />So, I see above the Pending a button to send money.<br /><br />DO I send money then to the Blockchain account and then over to SR?<br /><br />Or, from what you wrote, maybe that is an extra step?<br /><br />Thanks!

				If you click the PENDING sign, it should tell you how long it&#039;ll take until the coins you have purchased will be part of your account/wallet at Coinbase. From the time of purchasing BTC to when they&#039;re available in your Coinbase wallet is about a week. (I forget why the delay. Probably has to do with the whole bank account thing.) But once the &#039;pending&#039; transfer period has elapsed, you can then send them to Blockchain or SR, and that particular transfer should only take a few hours...
