				Does anyone prefer one over the other? <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the extracts but I&quot;m always worried about overdosing a bit on them or if they are loaded up with all types of crap.

				I found kratom to be pretty crap in general, and extracts were very inconsistent.

				Really? Well I got it cheap enough, figure its worth a try just to see how it is. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen so many mixed reviews it seems like its either a love or hate thing. I&#039;m just hoping I can get a boost from it.

				Well I just tried some today...5g..<br /><br />I was loving it...besides dealing wth the slight headache, but I wonder if thats cause of the coffee I had earlier..&nbsp; <br /><br />It definately gets a nice kick when you lay down, thats when it really hit me..very very very relaxing...

				I love Kratom.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great substitute for pain killers your anal doctors don&#039;t want to give you.&nbsp; That said, I&#039;ve had some shitty kratom, but I have a good supplier now.&nbsp; My favorite is super indonesian.&nbsp; I believe it is a mix of strains, not sure though.&nbsp; Best part is I don&#039;t have to deal with bitcoins for it as it is legal in the US.

				Yeah not dealing with bitcoins and illegal stuff is nice sometimes :)<br /><br />The only thing that I&#039;m not liking about it is the headaches.... I got 2 other strains I&#039;m going to try to see if they are headache free..<br />But yeah, for a natural remedy this is way better than oxy&#039;s,percs or vicodins... <br /><br />It&#039;s funny, cause my 2 friends that abuse percs looked at me like I was a drug addict for trying out a natural herb like kratom... its soo funny how these pharma companies and lawmakers make herbs look soo bad..

When I went to go eat dinner and that water was like &quot;wow!&quot; I should of realized I was a bit dehydrated..later I read that Kratom can dehydrate you a bit..combine that with not eating/drinking much for the day I think thats what caused it..<br /><br />I gotta say though, after falling asleep last night , that Kratom lasts a while...or it could be just becuase its the first time I&#039;ve taken it. I was worried about the addiction part of it, but I can&#039;t imagine getting anything done while being on it, so its just going to be used for when its a boring day,etc.. <br />
