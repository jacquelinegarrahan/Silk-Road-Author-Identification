				JumboMonkeyBiscuit top notch vendor review(BITCOIN)!<br /><br />Having been using the road now for a decent amount of time, I find that I am always faced with two questions. 1.)How do you anonymously get bitcoin to your account wallet to use to make purchases? AND 2.)What to buy once you get the coins into your account wallet?<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no easy answer for the second there is no easy answer, the road is flush with variety for people with all different tastes and preferences.&nbsp; Can&#039;t complain about this.<br /><br />In response to the question of obtaining bitcoins, Im sure many of you have purchased moneypak or vanilla reload or some such thing and attempted to give the vendor the card number and recieved nothing in return but an empty card and no coins in my wallet.&nbsp; This happened to me with five!!!!! FIVE!!!!! 5!!!!! different vendors at different times when I was quickly trying to get bitcoins and had no time to research or my go-to vendor was unavailable.&nbsp; Unfortunately people can and will lie to you and take advantage of you in this world no matter where you are.&nbsp; Bitoin buyers beware until you find a trusted vendor you are taking a big risk that SR support will not stand behind as bitcoin transactions are done without the escrow system being functionally involved.<br /><br />Let me get to my point...&nbsp; the whole purpose of this thread is to post my experience with a particularly stellar vendor for bitcoins that goes by the user name JumboMonkeyBiscuit. JMB has always been 100% honest, respectful,and helpful with all my questions. I have been a repeat customer of theirs for a while now and have multiple flawless clockwork transactions.&nbsp; JMB no longer deals with reload cards for bitcoin, but instead has set up a system to accept your cash in the mail in exchange for bitcoins to your account wallet totally anonymously with no links to your credit cards or banking information. <br /><br />JMB gets your coins to you faster than any other coin vendor that I have dealt with.&nbsp; JMB is an excellent communicator! I was scared at first to place any amount of cash in an package and mail it nervous that my shipping methods maybe were not up to par, or that my package might get lost and I would be out all the money I sent from thievery... but through every step of preparing myself to try this way of getting coins from cash in the mail, JMB was answering no less than 3-5 messages per day back and forth with me until I felt comfortable with how this process works. From some &#039;common sense&#039; basics in stealth such as &quot;dont make it feel like its a stack of cash inside&quot; and also provided&nbsp; me with several simple options of how to set up a package so that if accidentally broken open in shipping, that cash doesn&#039;t just flow out of the open end.&nbsp; JMB is an honest vendor that holds their customers comfort and satisfaction in very high regard.&nbsp; You are definitely in good hands with JMB! <br /><br />You&#039;ve got nothing to lose ever by ordering from JMB because you will be taken care.&nbsp; Some vendors take the money and run for a quick gain by ripping people off... but not JMB! This vendor has the big picture in mind and doesn&#039;t try to get rich off of you on one deal but rather takes a very reasonable percentage of the money you ship.&nbsp; And you quickly get your coins its really that simple.&nbsp; <br /><br />So any time you need coins plan a few days in advance, contact JumboMonkeyBiscuit to confirm that this service is available, buy then listing, put great care and pride into preparing your package you are sending because on top of it all JMB gives $50 free daily to the customer that used the most creative stealth and most efficient use of space keeping the package compact.<br /><br />JMB has over 1500+ 5/5 transactions in these past five months and is continually working to make sure to provide the best possible cash in the mail for bitcoin service possible to help users maintain their safety and their anonymity.&nbsp; <br /><br />THANKS EVERYONE FOR READING MY FIRST POST!!!!!!!!!!! ARE YOU STILL AWAKE ???? My apologies but when a vendor really is this good they deserve glowing reviews and people need to know who they can trust.&nbsp; Hope this post was helpful and inspired you guys to try this cash in the mail for bitcoins!
