				Chuck Norris&#039;s buddy United Distributions once asked him how much wood a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. He then shouted, &quot;HOW DARE YOU RHYME IN THE PRESENCE OF CHUCK NORRIS!&quot; and ripped out United Distributions throat. Holding United Distributions throat in his hand he bellowed, &quot;Don&#039;t f*ck with Chuck!&quot; Two years and five months later he realized the irony of this statement and laughed so hard that anyone within a hundred mile radius of the blast went deaf.
