				I honestly have no idea how to get btc but I can buy steam games atm and I want enough btc for something off the silk road would anyone be interested? I pretty much just have a credit card linked to my steam account and that&#039;s all I have that I can use to get BTC atm. it&#039;d be nice if someone could help me out and buy some steam games, just look through steam and figure out what you want and I&#039;ll sell it to you for the same value in BTC....it&#039;d be helpfull for a noob who wants some trees. :)

I just pay them back in cash.

				LocalBitCoin has a lot of ways to pay, can&#039;t you send a postal money order or something? I am a total newb myself but finding a place to buy coin was one of the easiest parts of the process. I&#039;m a typical internet user so the all of the security programs presented me with the biggest learning curve.

				I already sent a money order and I&#039;m working on getting the money back, I wanted to go send it myself but someone&nbsp; thought it would be a good idea to just send it themselves and they used the wrong service, one campbx doesn&#039;t accept. so I don&#039;t even know how to get my money back.
