				Was it a RED slip or a PEACH slip?<br /><br />Many postal workers have been not wearing their uniforms. nobody really gives a shit at that organization.<br /><br />I understand your worries but I don&#039;t think it was a CD.

Probably it wasn&#039;t though, if he gave up that easily. That and the outfit makes me think he&#039;s just a normal postal worker who just doesn&#039;t give a fuck, and gets hundreds of signatures a day. BUT go with your instinct. Don&#039;t risk what you aren&#039;t willing to lose -- and act casual around postal workers regardless. &quot;Oh, I wasn&#039;t expecting anything so I don&#039;t know if I should accept it&quot; sounds a lot more normal than a shifty-eyed &quot;no&quot;<br /><br />In the meantime, check out this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165838.0<br />it might ease some anxiety about receiving mail.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, did you read what the slip said? I haven&#039;t found anything googling red signature slips.

				Did you order something requiring a sig? What are you more worried bout, the sig or the out of uniform postal guy? I don&#039;t understand why you only have 1 hour either, is it when they close or did he tell ya that? In general, most people, when asked for a sig by the PO just sign without a 2nd thought and take their package. It doesn&#039;t prove you ardered anything, it only proves you accepted mail like anyone else would.

				Bro if u order&#039;d something from the NL, depending on what shipping u chose, that says allot!! go to the vendor, that u order&#039;d the pack from in the NL and ask him if u were suppose to sign..<br /><br />and u have 5 days to go get ur mail from the PO. But if u refused then im nnot sure.. and red slip? never heard or seen one..<br /><br />They would do everything normal, have u sign then wait for u to get almost in and pick u up..<br /><br />before u let good shit go, go to the vendor profile, look at the shipping option, see if it requires a sig, some due.. pm ur vendor ask him also..

				Keep in mind if you don&#039;t open it then it will be returned to sender. If the sender used a fake return address then it goes to the dead letter office. If it goes to the dead letter office they are going to open it and find your drugs and know your name/address.<br /><br />People often overlook what happens when you do not pick up your SR order.

				in some places USPS mail is not delivered by USPS car or uniformed, i have seen place they drive regular vehicles, take the mail out of hte trunk and are in normal street clothes<br />So a CD will not always be in postal uniform<br />It will be whatever is the normal look for that area
