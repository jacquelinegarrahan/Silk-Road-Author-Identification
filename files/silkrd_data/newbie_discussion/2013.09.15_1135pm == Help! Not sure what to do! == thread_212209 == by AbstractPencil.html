				So I ordered a fake from KingOfClubs the other day. Everything was going fine until 2 days ago. He just stopped responding to my messages and hasn&#039;t logged on since then. <br /><br />He still hasn&#039;t made the fake yet and it is still processing. Should I cancel the order? His page says he doesn&#039;t allow cancellations. The only reason that I am hesitant to cancel it is because he has my name and address.<br /><br />What should I do?<br /><br />Edit: made it more clear

				Sorry, this is my first purchase and I&#039;m probably over thinking it and getting a little too paranoid!<br /><br />Thanks for the reassurance though :)<br /><br />However, does anyone have any experience with KingOfClubs? I&#039;d love to hear what your opinions are of him!

				<br />Log-On on SilkRoad and the chec these two links..<br /><br />*************************************************************<br />First link is from &#039;&#039;KingOfClubs&#039;&#039; buyers discussion:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/discussion/user/eaee669cc1<br /><br />*************************************************************<br />Second link is from &#039;&#039;KingOfClubs&#039;&#039; buyers reviews sorted out, so you can see right away how many bad reviews &#039;&#039;KingOfClubs&#039;&#039; have <br />and how many medium or good reviews they/she/he get ...<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/reviews/eaee669cc1<br /><br />*************************************************************<br /><br />From what is see, i be very careful&nbsp; to order anything from this guy... To many bad reviews and all reports talk about the same thing; <br />after they send a pic. and release their funds communication stops.. See for your self check out reviews &amp; discussions and if you think <br />that good reviews are good enough to out weight bad then do nothing, but good reviews can be manipulating so be careful...<br />Good luck and&nbsp; don&#039;t be shy when comes to your money, don&#039;t give it away just because you to shy to do nothing... Scamers are counting on newbies <br />lack of persistence and to be naive.. Make the right choice and once again ,,, Good luck<br /><br />
