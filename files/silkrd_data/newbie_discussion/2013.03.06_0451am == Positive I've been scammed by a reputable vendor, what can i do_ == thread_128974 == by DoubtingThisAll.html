				I ordered something from vendor &quot;Oliver&quot; about 7 months ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Priority shipping from U.S. to the U.S.&nbsp; &nbsp;I received an excellent product in 4 days.<br /><br />I ordered again.&nbsp; &nbsp;After two weeks..nothing.&nbsp; He claimed it got &quot;returned to sender.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said he would re-ship so I asked him to ship to the address that I will be at for the next few weeks (at that time).&nbsp; He confirmed that address.&nbsp; It never came.&nbsp; He professionally apologized and begged me not to leave negative feedback.&nbsp; I didnt.&nbsp; &nbsp;I instantly placed faith (this is kinda how some of this goes no?) and waited longer.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; He then said that he shipped the package to &quot;insert address&quot; and it was the address that he , himself, knew NOT to send it to any longer.<br /><br />So.&nbsp; &nbsp;He refunded me.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thanked him.&nbsp; &nbsp;I placed another order instantly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again via US to US priority mail.&nbsp; It has now been another 3 weeks and nothing other than &quot;i sent it express and you should have it beginning of next week&quot; (2 or 3 days)&nbsp; and that was nearly 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; Now I am not even getting replies.&nbsp; &nbsp;His page says he is in &quot;vacation mode&quot; but he still logs on.<br /><br />I had another 4 or 5 days till the order auto finalized and I warned him that If i do not get a reply i will be forced to leave negative feedback.<br /><br />I come on the site today and the order is no longer in my order history.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what i can possibly do.<br /><br />Who has the authority to erase open orders &quot;in transit&quot; ?<br />Who can I contact to get a response or to hold this vendor accountable???

				Contact SR Support from the main site and also use the &quot;report vendor&quot; button on the vendor&#039;s profile page.

				Found the contact on site.&nbsp; Thanks scout.&nbsp; &nbsp;When things like this happen (i&#039;ve only had about 5 transactions...all positive except for this) should I expect a resolution?&nbsp; Or am I possibly just screwed out of around 10bc?

				As long as you stayed in escrow, yes, you can hope for resolution and probably a refund of some percentage.&nbsp; However, if you finalized early, then I&#039;m afraid you won&#039;t be able to get any back unless the vendor himself offers.

				I have always finalized early because of my previous low level of purchases.&nbsp; This time I did not finalize early.&nbsp; Yesterday I looked and it said there was (4 or 5, I cant remember) days until auto finalize (I assume that once it&#039;s auto finalized that it&#039;s no longer in escrow?).&nbsp; But today I come on to check for a reply and my &quot;orders&quot; section is empty as if someone finalized or wiped out the order.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how that can happen.&nbsp; The odd thing is that it was no longer &quot;in transit&quot; and taken off of &quot;auto finalized in 5 days&quot; (maybe 4 I cant recall) the very next day after I told the vendor that I was going to post negative feedback if i receive no reply.&nbsp; He asked on numerous occasions (almost in a pleading way) not to leave negative feedback.<br /><br />It&#039;s been such a fiasco that I actually might have left a &quot;warning&quot; feedback , which may account for it being erased.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been so frustrated with the seller for this 2 month ordeal that I&#039;ve gotten all frazzled.&nbsp; This could possibly be the reason it is no longer in my &quot;order&quot; section&nbsp; (?).&nbsp; Does that mean it is no longer in escrow?<br /><br />This just sucks.&nbsp; This is a legitimate prescription for a condition I have (yeah yeah, so many say that but in my case it is true) that my doctor WILL prescribe to me; But without insurance the doctor bill and the prescription end up being far more than this method which had proved successful the first time.<br /><br />Regardless:&nbsp; Every shopper searching for Alprazolam should avoid &quot;Oliver&quot; (he &#039;mysteriously&#039; is out of stock at just this time but claims to be back soon with &#039;HUGE sales&quot;) at all costs.&nbsp; He started off with great feedback and my first transaction was flawless and I felt I built trust and gained a legitimate affordable source for my meds.&nbsp; And then he kinda just let his business go down the tubes as his recent feedback from myself and others have mentioned.<br /><br />I hope that as a community that we can all pull together and stop purchasing products from such users.&nbsp; Perhaps if that happens....they will be forced to be more responsible, honest, and forthcoming if they want to do business here.<br /><br />again:&nbsp; &quot;Oliver&quot; and he usually only sells pure powder alprazolam.<br /><br />Shame:&nbsp; It was a potential gold mine for him and a wonderful solution to my current issues.

				I&#039;m not sure how that would happen either unless he canceled the order.<br /><br />You&#039;ll need to wait and hear back from support - hopefully they&#039;ll get in touch soon!

				If you finalized there really isn&#039;t anything they can do. The vendor has your money so SR support can&#039;t get it back for you. <br /><br />All you can do is leave negative feedback and tell. <br /><br />Geez sounds like you were very patient with the vendor. Just so you know in the future you open a resolution before the auto finalize date and extend time.

				Damn, were you dropped on your head as an infant? This guy comes close to screwing you over multiple times and you continued to place orders with him? <br /><br />And, did I read that you FE&#039;d on previous orders? Shit, you never FE. Even with trusted vendors. If someone won&#039;t sell to you because you have no history, move on to another vendor. It may cost a little more but you will be protected. Nothing good can happen when you FE but plenty of bad will.

				The concern I have is I too purchased from a reputable vendor but he/she required FE because of less than 5 transactions.&nbsp; Some vendors won&#039;t even deal with a new person so you are stuck dealing with some other vendors and I think they rip people off.&nbsp; I am waiting to see how this vendor wants to resolve this before blasting his/her name negatively all over.<br /><br />We have to watch out for each other in order to keep this thing as legit as possible!

				This dipshit screwed me over as well. First he said he shipped then said he had family issues and some other shit. Then after nearly 6 weeks he says it was &quot;lost&quot; and would double my order and send it fastest way possible. Its been 34 business days since he promised to reship double my order plus priority shipping. Doesn&#039;t reply nor read messages for 3+ weeks.<br /><br />Just like the whole tony76 is lucydrop is tesslated. Arn0ld is 0liver is J4y. <br /><br />And again probably a huge coincidence they live in same city and sell the exact same product. :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve had 30+ transactions and both of these scammer outfits got me. Same M.O and just waaaaay to many coincidents.<br /><br />
