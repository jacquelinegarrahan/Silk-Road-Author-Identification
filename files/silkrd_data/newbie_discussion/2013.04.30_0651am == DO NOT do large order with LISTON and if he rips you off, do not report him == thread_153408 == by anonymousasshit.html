				Remember, he has your person info, you don&#039;t know who he is.&nbsp; This is my story:<br /><br />Some seller, have it where they get more money if bitcoins rise.&nbsp; Liston does this.&nbsp; He will sit on your order for almost two weeks and if the price crashed, he cancels your order.&nbsp; When it goes up, he sends it out next day or promises you extra if you FE that day.&nbsp; Here is my experience with him:<br /><br />Liston stated that he would and told him that I must only get packages from the US.&nbsp; The listing was for US, too.&nbsp; Here is how he is sneaky.&nbsp; He told me just to order the 50 quanity and send him the remaining balance.&nbsp; I had experience with him so I thought he was good.&nbsp; He sent me just the 50, I assume, it weighed about a third of the bag of 150.&nbsp; He wrapped it in paper, no tape, put it in a paper brown envelope and sent it about 10 days after I ordered.&nbsp; I asked for a refund and he refuses.&nbsp; I took it to SR and he offered a 10% refund and accused me of trying to get freebies....after I had spent between 1 and 2 K with him with no problems.<br />Here is the kicker:<br />He emailed me and told me that if I didn&#039;t just drop the dispute, finalize the order and give him positive feedback, he would send a bunch of shit to my house that was obviously suspicious looking, then call the postal investigators and my local police and provide them with the tracking information.&nbsp; I just wanted my refund and to be done with this guy.&nbsp; He was perfect for so many orders and the first time he messes up and I as him to correct it he pulls this.&nbsp; Wish I knew what to do...

				He instructed me to go outside of escrow after I asked him for a larger amount.&nbsp; He told me to just do one of his smaller orders and send the rest to him outside of escrow.&nbsp; The order was supposed to be US to US, after two&nbsp; weeks I got a package from another continent and it contained less than a third of what I paid for and was all crushed.&nbsp; I had to weigh the bars to verify even that.<br /><br />I told him.&nbsp; I had been a many time customer of his and he was starting to get sloppy, like marking things in transit 15 minutes after I ordered at 3:00AM and mailing 10 days later, but this time he told me to go to hell.&nbsp; We went to the resolution center and he lost, but still had most of my BC.&nbsp; I told him that since he gave me a 100% refund in the Resolution Center, he should send me the rest back, because that was only fair.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You can see the detailed threats in the customer support thread from a few days ago.<br /><br />Basically he told me to lick his ass and that he would make sure to it that I never got my money back and that if I didn&#039;t leave him alone, he would send a bunch of cocaine to my house in a very suspect package, report the tracking info to the feds, and get me busted.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; He instructed me to pay him outside of escrow (against seller agreement)<br />2.&nbsp; He basically admitted that he was keeping his customer&#039;s info and used that to threaten me with fed pen time for just asking him to give me a refund of money that I deserved.<br /><br />SPECIAL THANKS TO LIBERTAS FOR THE HELP!<br /><br />AND UP YOURS TO ALL THOSE HATERS WHO CALLED ME A LIAR/SCAMMER IN THE FORUMS.<br /><br />As long as you let him neglect to send things in a timely fashion and give him 5/5 after waiting a month and gave him a 5/5 even though you didn&#039;t get your product because &quot;he is a nice guy&quot; or &quot;He assured me it wasn&#039;t his fault&quot;- this is what happens eventually.<br /><br />Look here:<br />Topic: First Resolution Center visit with Liston&nbsp; (Read 56 times)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156984.0<br /><br />Then here:<br />Topic: HELP! Liston threatened having me arressed in SR inbox&nbsp; (Read 55 times)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157097.0<br /><br />Then, after that, go to the search bar here in the forum and type in &quot;liston&quot;.&nbsp; Read my old posts from April 30.&nbsp; You can see that I was ignored, mocked, questioned, and called a liar.<br /><br />Again, if you need help LIBERTAS HAS GOT YOUR BACK!<br /><br />David beat Goliath!<br /><br />I changed to a completely different town&#039;s PO and another PO Box in case he carries out his threat.<br /><br />Just in case he is reading.... Yo Liston, how&nbsp; you like me now, Mate?&nbsp; Was losing your account worth 2 and a half BC?<br /><br />If you are a buyer,&nbsp; please read the rules, including the Seller Agreement! Report ANY vendor that asks you to break them, especially all of these ones that require everyone to FE.&nbsp; That is just the same as going outside of escrow because once you finalize, he could send you a turd dressed up in a Santa costume and you can NEVER GET YOUR MONEY BACK!<br /><br />Yo Liston!&nbsp; Your done son!
