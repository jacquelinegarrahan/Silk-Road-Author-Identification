				I&#039;ve run across a few threads in the security section, where some users seemed very concerned that the encryption of https and tor was not enough. I&#039;m by no means an IT professional but the few tests that whatsmyip.org has to offer leads me to believe we are fairly incognito by just using the tor bundle.<br />Am I wrong?

				I don&#039;t think its a question of whether tor is.enough because when.it.comes to the government we never truly know what they are capable of. I think the real.question is.why not.use.as much.security as possible. Some.people feel more secure having more or less security than others.

				To my knowledge, spying on traffic within the TOR network itself is not possible. My understanding is that the primary vulnerability of the TOR network is at the so called &quot;exit nodes&quot;. The node operator could sniff unencrypted packets at the exit point. This is where HTTPS comes in. If the connection is via HTTPS, the packets are still encrypted after leaving the exit point.<br /><br />Assuming a valid and properly configured https connection, I think it&#039;s &quot;secure enough&quot;.<br /><br />Are there specific threads addressing other vulnerabilities? If so, perhaps you could share the links here.

				bottom line: use as much security levels as you can (afford) if you are feeling insecure for any reason. <br />-clean pc, <br />-encrypted OS &amp; encrypted data, <br />-internet connection of neighbours or public access, <br />-proxies, <br />-solid configuration<br />and THEN;<br />TOR.<br />anything else thinkable ?

				Use as much encryption that you feel is needed.&nbsp; The fact is Tor is used by the military so it&#039;s pretty damn secure by itself.&nbsp; I had a friend who does IT for the government, he actually turned me on to SR.&nbsp; This fact alone put my mind at ease about its safety!&nbsp; Its always a good idea to have a back up plan however.&nbsp; &nbsp;Trust nothing!

I am anti violence and partial on war. I feel diplomatic solutions would be a better choice in s better world. It is unfortunate that the TOR network can be used to harm people and promote others who harm people. The use of this network by pedophiles is absolutely disgusting. They do so much harm to children but they can&#039;t see it because they are selfish of their own fascination with hildren. I believe it is largely a psychological thing and the oerosb is only to blame due to the fact that he doesn&#039;t control his urges but I wish tor could stop helping them save their porn and contact each other. And shot down the sites promoting weapons, hired assassins, and other violent ideas.

				Good deal. Thanks for the replies all. <br />I&#039;m using tor bundle and connected through a romanian vpn that doesn&#039;t log ip addresses, so I feel secure. Just wanted to make sure I wasn&#039;t missing something obvious ;)
