				I have another account i use for buying and this is my new sellers account. <br /><br />In my 10 months of buying from SR and something like 90 orders, only 2 didn&#039;t arrive and they were canceled by the vendors. I think its fucking amazing. I have had alot of international stuff to. <br /><br />I belive its easier, safer and a vastly more choice than buying off the street.

				feels good, always be careful with FEing tho...i have reason to believe i was scammed by powerade, with the 25g mdma order, he required fe to US and with 3 1/2-4+ weeks going on while others in neighboring states are getting it in 5-8 days.

				Bit of a necro-post but since I can&#039;t post in the Rumor Mill yet, I don&#039;t care!<br /><br />My first order was with TopNotch as well. I needed the gear (you know what I mean) and gambled on FE for a gram. He/She was helpful and got my order in the post the same day so it only took 22 hours from clicking &#039;Buy&#039; to smoking a line. Considering I live in the arse end of nowhere and usually I drive 600 miles in 12 hours to score, this deal has saved me £90 in petrol, wear and tear on my car and the worry of getting nicked on the street.<br /><br />I went for his/her stronger stuff and whoa. It has taken me 24 hours to stop puking and feeling nauseous. I haven&#039;t had gear like this since the late 90&#039;s. I take 15mls of methadone daily and haven&#039;t been a daily H user for around 5 years. When I buy on the street I can normally put away a gram in a night. I have been smoking for 24 hours now and I have barely used 0.2g. I smoke off foil, don&#039;t IV anymore. <br />If you do IV and are used to shitty street gear be careful with this stuff, would be very easy to go over.<br /><br />Stealth was okay, could be better with just a small change, I have passed on my comments and criticisms.<br /><br />Quality Heroin, super fast delivery, quick and helpful communications. Thanks TopNotch.<br /><br />
