				Sigh...<br /><br />If you log into he phishing site with your SR credentials. Whoever runs the phishing site has your information, and will probably log into your SR account and clean it out and change the password.

				This is my first time posting, but I would like to say I have been able to access SR for the last 30 mins. If you are having issues getting to the main page just restart your computer, and make sure it&#039;s not the same IP address as before. I have had the best luck with IP addresses starting with 60-85, anything 90-230 gives me a connection timeout, or error. Thanks DPR for your hard work, and your patience of such situation. DPR is a master mind!!! He thinks about these situations before they occur unlike other people &amp; websites, and the results always show him having the upper hand at the end. Everyone needs to remember that no matter what BM site you do business with there will always be issues. It&#039;s a matter of time, popularity, greed, ransoms, gov, competition, and those who have the mind set of ruining others creations due to there suffers. Be open minded and think positive. If anyone thinks this is such an issue you should delete your account. Those other websites have no customers, and once they do guess what will happen....DOS attack!!!!, and they probably won&#039;t be able to counteract the attack. Best wishes to SR, and those who sail the ship!!! ARRRHHHH
