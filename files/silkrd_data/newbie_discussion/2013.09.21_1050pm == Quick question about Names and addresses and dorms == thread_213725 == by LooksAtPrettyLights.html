				Okay, so I&#039;m planning on ordering some mushrooms for the first time off this site. I have heard that you should use your real name and address. However I live in a dorm and would rather not have my package go through the University to get to me. If I include my (real) name and the address of a friend who lives off campus, would that potentially raise any red flags with USPS? If so, does anyone have experience ordering and having it delivered to a dorm room?

				Personally I&#039;m not a fan of sending things to my own name.&nbsp; The address is all that really matters.&nbsp; if it makes it to your address who cares what name is on it?&nbsp; If it is your name, its more difficult to say that it wasn&#039;t meant for you than if its a different name.&nbsp; The dorm number/address could have a mistake in it, but really who is going to &quot;mistakenly&quot; put their own name down?&nbsp;

				Yes... there is a possibility that your package will be flagged somehow.&nbsp; The person named does not live at that address.<br /><br />Say the mailman that delivers in that area has been doing so daily for the last 20 years... this guy knows who lives where, it&#039;s his route.&nbsp; He may think there is some kind of error since you haven&#039;t changed your address to that one, nor even put your name on the mailbox... so he may just drop a notice saying come pick it up in person.&nbsp; (this is also a reason why you&#039;d not want to send shit to an abandoned house)<br /><br />Then lets say you do go to the post office to pick it up... you show them the card and your ID, but your ID still has your parents address... the postal worker may be a dick and say that your ID doesn&#039;t match up.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying this is 100% or anything, but it is a risk.&nbsp; <br /><br />People constantly ask this question... &quot;can I deliver to my dorm room?&quot;&nbsp; Yeah, why wouldn&#039;t you be able to?... what&#039;s the difference really?
