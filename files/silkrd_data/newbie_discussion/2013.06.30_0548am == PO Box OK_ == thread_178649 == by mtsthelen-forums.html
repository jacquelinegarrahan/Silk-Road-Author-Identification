				I have a PO Box and am thinking of getting stuff shipped there since it *seems* better than shipping to my house. Thoughts on this?<br /><br />I just want to mix it up a little, is all. Just LSD, and it&#039;s only my second order, but have never shipped to my house and part of me thinks it&#039;s best to keep it that way, but the drop I used (once) for my initial order has asked me to find an alternative.

				Some vendors won&#039;t ship to PO Boxes so be aware of that.<br /><br />To be honest, shipping to your house isn&#039;t a big deal. That&#039;s if you live there alone of course, or with trustworthy people!

				Thanks, all. I suppose my biggest concern is simply that the PO Box gives me one layer of protection away from them easily raiding my home. But maybe it doesn&#039;t even provide that?

				It still has your name on it. its just best to order home, less suspicious and will most likely make the way to you out of all options.

				Yeah, I suppose another layer of concern is the vendor having my actual home address. At least with a PO box that much is shielded.

				A PO box has its ups and downs.<br /><br />Pros are the the vendor will not have your address which is good considering extorting and threatening buyers is on the rise.<br /><br />Cons outweigh the pros and my opinion and the biggest con would be that you are foregoing your plausible deniablility.<br /><br />Getting caught and a controlled delivery happening at your house is bad enough. At that point you already look like you did it. You could always get off on plausible deniablility though which is basically &quot;I don&#039;t know who shipped those drugs to my house with my name of it Mr. Judge, someone must have spent $20-$500+ on drugs for me for no reason and I have no idea who it is.<br /><br />A PO box would forego these opportunities unless you are fucking awesome at it. Getting a package full of drugs and going to pick it up even a couple day later is definitely not something you could deny. &quot;Oh yeah I just so happened to visit my PO box when I got a package that I had no idea existed&quot;....yeah no, not going to hold up worth a damn.<br /><br />If you ran a legitimate business or some shit that gives you a reason to check mail ever X days, then you&#039;d have an excuse to go there, otherwise keep it at home.

				Thanks, CannabisConsumer<br /><br />I have to visit my POBox every day and I get a good, regular flow of mail there, so that part is totally plausible. I&#039;m also talking about shipping LSD, which is amongst the easiest things to ship because of its form-factor. So for that reason I&#039;m thinking POB is the right move (for me) and it keeps me from sharing my home address with anyone.

				If you do decide to use your PO Box then you should definitely PM the vendor first as I know the majority are against sending to PO Boxes. <br /><br />But if you were to say you use yours for regular mail and use it everyday, then I should imagine they would be fine with that. I wouldn&#039;t just order straight away and put your PO Box in the address bar.<br /><br />That&#039;s just a suggestion, and something I would personally do, and also something I would expect if I were a vendor.

				Makes sens,pe, Japan1980, and yep, I&#039;ve already communicated with the appropriate vendors, pre-order!
