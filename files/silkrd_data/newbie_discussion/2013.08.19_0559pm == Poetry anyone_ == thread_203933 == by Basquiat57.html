				Whispering winds blow through my blinds when it&#039;s hot and the windows of my minds eye are open<br />and hoping this realistic blame won&#039;t change the<br />fallacies of my dilutional fame in this sense<br />mainframe ego exchange game..<br />Thrice i found this souls business abound a<br />naturally found spring of what this life will bring,<br />Yet once was the common denomination of the<br />Lords contemlation as I digest continually on this<br />continuum on my leased contingency. Freedom is<br />the reward. It only comes with sacrifice.<br />And there i was playing poker while the spirit was<br />embellishing on brevity like a professional fire<br />stoker. This wisdom flowing freely is finely crafted<br />like a handmade knife by Boker ..All of this spinning<br />and massive false false grinning makes me cry that<br />we&#039;re all unwarranted jokers. Stiff minds will break<br />in the end like an oak tree in high wind while the<br />limber finds slumber with solice and free flowing<br />rainbow dream.<br />Ambient seas of eternal blissful energies are<br />pervading your everything, infiltrating all unknown<br />memories while you cast your souls sails into the<br />winds of this wanderfull wayward trail of traversing<br />adversity by a blue green hues hand of divine<br />design.<br />I panned out looking across this pantomime of free<br />flowing energy and saw a planned out flight being<br />flown by most, like an albatross with no grounded<br />land to call home upon the coast. I pinned up a<br />stout picture of what looked like what we had lost<br />the most in this rhythm and time I stretch out a<br />toast, to the gold plated cross with no regard to the<br />souls left alone to starve in the desert sand without<br />even so much as a stale piece of toast<br />Seven is seven and nine is nine. Seeing is sexy<br />and time is fine. Savory is simmering and steam<br />burns a line. Eleven is perspective and that takes<br />due time. Stationary is a sign looking to redefine.<br />Stems of thought will see you through this brevity<br />in time.<br />Hotwings and diamond rings and basketball<br />playoffs and all of these things society sees fit to<br />see do not impress me. The parameters of<br />misguided brevity and roundhouse reality kick<br />teeth of those whose bread leave unleavenedty.<br />Bakers temperatures hold nothing more than<br />subjectivity as we grasp to perspective and all<br />dignity.<br />To what end does my stance and the strength<br />thereof difine my level of transcend? With which<br />blend of this trance and my rants thereof shall i<br />find my beveled intend? Within who&#039;s definition of<br />twitch and popularity do we flow through this<br />thatch and to prosperity? Do these questions add<br />depth to your consciousness or am i simply<br />babbling around a perspective of clarity?<br />I Am trying to throw my disks within the same<br />lines i see the birds be. I Am trying to vest my soul<br />within we. I Am Trying to decide if a code is within<br />free. I Am Trying to flow my risks beyond three. I<br />Am Trying to grow within limitless boundary. I Am<br />Trying to tan the Hyde of that which we hide. I Am<br />Trying to quit trying. <br /><br />

				Bumping your post so I can quote 3 of my favourites.<br /><br />“To see a World in a Grain of Sand <br />And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, <br />Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand <br />And Eternity in an hour.” <br /><br />-William Blake<br /><br /><br />HAD I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,<br />Enwrought with golden and silver light,<br />The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br />Of night and light and the half light,<br />I would spread the cloths under your feet:<br />But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br />I have spread my dreams under your feet;<br />Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. <br /><br />- W.B. Yeats<br /><br />Whose woods these are I think I know.<br />His house is in the village, though;<br />He will not see me stopping here<br />To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br /><br />My little horse must think it queer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />To stop without a farmhouse near<br />Between the woods and frozen lake<br />The darkest evening of the year.<br /><br />He gives his harness bells a shake<br />To ask if there is some mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The only other sounds the sweep<br />Of easy wind and downy flake.<br /><br />The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,<br />But I have promises to keep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />And miles to go before I sleep.<br /><br />- Robert Frost
