				Just got these in the mail a couple of days ago and managed to try them out last night so I figured I might as well report in.<br />First, some numbers.<br /><br /><br />Product - 25i-NBOMe <br />Listing - <br />--------------------------------------<br />Ratings <br />--------------------------------------<br />Speed - 9/10 - Ordered late Monday night with Priority, received the next Monday afternoon.&nbsp; Would be faster without the weekend.<br /><br />Packaging - 10/10 - Not a whole lot of precaution necessary beyond eye barriers, needless to say the packaging looks just like anything normal.<br /><br />Communication - 10/10 - Seller actually responded to the feedback I left and cleared up some confusion about the coloring.&nbsp; (I was under the impression that the uneven pink color on the back of the blotters was an indication of uneven laying, but apparently it is simply a reaction of the HPBCD).&nbsp; No other communication necessary.<br /><br />Product - 10/10 - Got precisely what I expected and nothing less.&nbsp; Great art on the blotters, fantastic trip, good price.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Trip Report<br />--------------------------------------<br />Dose - 1000ug<br />ROI - Blotter placed between gum and top lip<br />Weight - 135lb (61kg)<br /><br /><br />T+00:00 - Gums brushed and mouth rinsed with water to clean mucus membranes.&nbsp; Blotter placed between upper gum and lip.<br />T+00:20 - Blotter moved to other side of mouth. <br />T+00:40 - Blotter moved again.&nbsp; First alerts appearing.&nbsp; Standard psychedelic alerts, sweaty palms, growing energy, slight anxiety.<br />T+01:00 - Noticing visual distortions in edges.&nbsp; Blotter swallowed.&nbsp; Slight stomach unease, which may be attributed to eating directly before dosing.&nbsp; Nothing too uncomfortable, shrooms is much worse.<br />T+01:20 - Colors becoming more vivid.&nbsp; All edges becoming soft unless focused on intently.&nbsp; Slight amphetamine rush that carries for the next few hours.<br />T+01:40 - Turned off the Cleveland Show and turned on Madagascar 3.&nbsp; Colors were absolutely fantastic, as was the music.&nbsp; Definite music enhancement.&nbsp; Starting to notice an increased empathy.&nbsp; I seem to be absorbing the mood of the characters on screen.&nbsp; When they are ecstatic, I am on the edge of my seat, when they are down, the rooms seems to grow darker and the wiggling edges of the objects in the room seem to take on slower vibrations. The highly detailed animation and character models seem to come to life before my eyes.&nbsp; The fur on the animals squirms and moves even when they are standing still.&nbsp; I highly recommend a movie like this that is highly visual and geared towards a younger audience.&nbsp; <br />T+2:20 - Approaching the peak of the trip during the middle of the movie.&nbsp; By the time the circus scene comes in with the music and crazy visualizations, I am&nbsp; in full effect.&nbsp; The already awesome colors and shapes morph into each other along with the music, making me feel as though all of it was happening directly in front of me.<br />T+2:40 - Peak comes and goes in waves, very similar to mushrooms.&nbsp; There is always a constant layer of visual activity, but at certain times the room will take on a colored glow and a wave of euphoria will wash over me.&nbsp; The visuals kick into high gear after I smoke a decent sized bowl of some dank.&nbsp; I notice some significant trailing when I move my hand across my field of vision, which leads to me staring at my hand while I wave it back and forth through the air for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; This has a very goofy vibe to it like mushrooms too.&nbsp; <br />T+3:20 - Madagascar 3 over, switching to Pink Floyd&#039;s The Wall.&nbsp; Visuals plateauing but body tingle is persistent.&nbsp; Mild motor impairment when first standing.&nbsp; The movie makes perfect sense, so there&#039;s definitely some headspace to this, but it doesn&#039;t feel like a &quot;teaching&quot; psychedelic like LSD or mushrooms.<br />T+3:40 - Smoke again and visuals take a bump while body high eases off.&nbsp; I am completely unable to feel the smoke in my lungs or throat but am taking giant hits.&nbsp; I find this hilarious over and over again.<br />T+4:50 - Movie ends and I turn on music and lay on the couch.&nbsp; CEV&#039;s are still quite strong as I close my eyes and let the sounds of Andy McKee direct the colors and shapes that appear before my eyes.&nbsp; Every time I close my eyes and reopen them, colors become very enhanced for a few minutes.&nbsp; The tree branches I can see from the window in the dark multiply as they wave in the heavy wind outside.&nbsp; The flashes of lightning seem to light up the sky for an unnatural amount of time.&nbsp; I can see the jagged streak of light for seconds instead of an instant as it slowly fades into the blackness of the sky.<br />T+5:50 - CEV&#039;s still going strong but OEV&#039;s tapering off.&nbsp; Body high fading off but mental energy is still quite high.&nbsp; I am ready for bed but my brain is not.<br />T+6:20 - I lay in bed in the dark.&nbsp; No TV, no sounds, no stimulus at all to further distract my brain.&nbsp; The geometric shapes projected on my eyelids make it hard to clear my mind but I am not yet exhausted so I simply enjoy them for now. Eventually I drift off to sleep.<br /><br />After Effects:&nbsp; I did not get very much sleep, probably about 5 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;I woke up with no real discomfort aside from a bit of mental fatigue.&nbsp; I smoked and took a nap later in the day and recovered most of the energy I had lost, I feel like I will be back to 100% tomorrow, so I have nothing negative to say as far as any after-effects go.<br /><br />Overall Thoughts:&nbsp; I enjoyed this chemical very much.&nbsp; I had read some promising things about it and having enjoyed 2C-I, I figured I would enjoy it.&nbsp; It did have more of a mushroom feel to me as opposed to LSD as it is often compared, but that&#039;s bound to vary between everyone.&nbsp; I will be ordering this again sometime soon and intend on trying 2 blotters here in about a week.&nbsp; I am also interested in trying the other Nbome&#039;s as well now, and will most likely try 25C next.&nbsp; I was satisfied all around from the time I placed my order til the time I went to sleep last night.&nbsp; Good to see that the high ranked sellers are there for a reason.

				Thanks for this! I&#039;m thinking about getting that NBOMe, too.<br /><br />To anyone else: are there any noticeable differences among the types of NBOMes?
