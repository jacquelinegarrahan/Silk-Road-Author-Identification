				Hey im new(well to the forum anyway)!<br /><br />Quick question:<br />All hyperthetically: If a vendor sells something to you which isnt actually what is advertised(at all)!<br /><br />Would you &#039;potentially&#039; accept a refund and give 5/5 FB?<br /><br />or<br /><br />Refuse refund and be honest with FB and &#039;hopefully&#039; stop alot of people buying the same shit(it aint very nice at all and thank fuck for benzos lol)?<br /><br />I havent had any experience with gaining trust, FB, what could potentially be done by &#039;hyperthetical&#039; vendor to my reputation. <br /><br />Basically id just like some honest opinions/answers about ramifications of above events from vendors and buyers overall??<br /><br />Nice serious start to my life on this forum haha<br /><br />Cheers<br />MEU<br /><br />

				What&#039;s the point with feedback if it isn&#039;t honest? When I make a purchase I completely rely on the feedback of the said product. Ofc there will be circumstances where you would want to take it up with the vendor in a personal message before leaving feedback, but if you&#039;ve gotten scammed I would strongly recommend that you make this reflect your feedback so that others don&#039;t fall for the same deal again.<br /><br />Taking the refund and leaving good feedback when you really don&#039;t mean it sounds extremely cowardly to me. I&#039;m thinking of an example from real life where someone is cooking you food and even though it tastes terrible you will tell the person a &#039;white lie&#039;.. once again, all depending on how well you know the person and what you expect from him/her ;)<br /><br />But with the market style SR is based on there&#039;s no room for white lies, the whole concept relies on people telling the truth when they give feedback on their order, so that others can have an idea of what to expect.<br /><br />...oh and welcome to the forums, hope you enjoy your ride :)

In general all the vendors i&#039;ve been in contact with are really nice people who wants the best for their customers. There might be some assholes out there, but this is what the resolve option is for. If you feel unfairly treated you can always take it up with SR Support, and they will have the last word on whether you were treated fair or not, and make sure you get your refund if the vendor refuses.<br /><br />Also, after you&#039;ve made a purchase, your bitcoins will stay in escrow until you release it to the vendor, which you do by finalizing the order, and if you respect the system (as in, don&#039;t finalize early ...you&#039;ll see alot of people using FE, which means you hand the bitcoins over to the vendor BEFORE you&#039;ve got the product), you will have full control of your money until you&#039;ve got the product.<br /><br />So as far as I&#039;m aware, no vendors will have any interest in scamming you unless they want a very short life here on SR.

				I&#039;m a bit confused... was this an accidental incident of sending the wrong product or is this just blatantly selling one chemical as another (more expensive) one and hoping a lot of people buy it before word gets out?&nbsp; Take the refund either way, but if he&#039;s ripping people off then out his ass.&nbsp; If it was a mistake, then the vendor is doing the right thing and doesn&#039;t need to have one mistake spread around the forum.

				That&#039;s not acceptable as a vendor, and it&#039;s not the way people do business here. I would not write a review but instead ask him for a refund or a reship for the right product.

				Not giving too much away but the product was for pure mdma pills, the marquis test said otherwise. i contacted the vendor many times and the last 5 at least mails they havent even had the courtesy to read. I was rude when i emailed them when was on the the &#039;things&#039; because i felt pretty sick but the other emails have just been stating facts and asking for a full refund and asking what was actually in them.<br />Im pretty sure the vendor has quite a few thousand of these to get rid of and I ordered 10. Well very, very coincidentily they could have been 10 bad ones but the chances of that, well i cant be arsed to work it out tbh.<br />They aint gonna kill you but they&#039;re still not what they said on the tin!<br />Any other questions?<br />MEU

				Does anyone know how long mdma tolerance takes to die down?<br /><br />Ive been taking this stuff for about 16 years(phew... 1st time white star, mate went bed cause didnt take but i just climbed out his downstairs window when feeling it and walked around the town barefoot for about 3 hours not a care in the world buzzing my tits off). <br /><br />Think 1996&nbsp; was when things started going downhill but could still get decent stuff if you tried hard enough and knew the right people. <br /><br />OMG 1 and half white anchors and a spliff of skunk round a mates house round 97 lol , lets just say i rang his sister and what i got from the convo was she was well into me and id planned what to say the next day and everything(lets just say she said i was talking pretty much bollox and she never said anything like that, sorry lol).<br /><br />And my journey home walking the streets with my sober mate. 2&#039;oclock in the morning empty streets(or were they? very much so according to him haha) I saw rabbits playing on the swings in the park and little groups of people all the way home 2-3miles. Honestly they were there in groups of about 4-5 and when i got close to them they were still there just standing nodding! My mate thought i was a lunatic but there literally were hundreds of mini groups of people (i didnt recognise by the way) all just standing there chatting and nodding there heads, when i tried chatting all they were doing was nodding there heads still, fooking absolutely most visual trip ive had off anything ever!!!!!<br />Ive had 2cb, 2ci, lsd 25, MDA(maybe it was that), liberty caps(hundreds in a go), ket(good and bad), salvia(that is just too mental for me now), never anything quite as vivid as that, wow i loved the whole experiance(Apart from the rejection the next day haha) Another post done. Dont worry they wont all be this long lollol

				I would say thanks for full refund, but would not give 5/5&nbsp; for getting something i didn&#039;t order<br />and getting sick of the shit.&nbsp; If they are selling something else than said on purpose it&#039;s called scamming, i believe.<br /><br />If it was on un-purpose i would still tell the truth. and possible forgive the mistake.<br /><br />You will get Good Karma telling everyone else here the truth.<br />Many will be thankful for warning them, and you self maybe be glad of reading a warning of false/bad product/vendor next time. <br /><br />While writing this it reminds of my old friend who had done speed on regular basis earlier&nbsp; and not so often at that time.<br />He found little bag that he had hide sometime earlier and snorted it, but it wasn&#039;t speed it was H and he nearly got killed.<br />His luck was that his wife came home for a run and saw him laying blue on floor and called help that arrived very quick.<br /><br />So you got to know what you take <br /><br />-Take Care
