				Just got my tax return and was thinking of investing in bitcoins with them, <br /><br />i just hope i dont end up buying drugs for all of them :)<br /><br />So good investment or not ?<br /><br />And anyone else here think it would be a brilliant move to be both a vendor on sr and a seller of legal bitcoins, that is if you can get your &quot;dirty&quot; bitcoins into that company, i cant be the first one to think of this&nbsp; ::)

But if the market collapse once again we&#039;ll loose all what we&#039;ve paid.<br />My heart is torn between the wish of seeing the btc going up or down...
