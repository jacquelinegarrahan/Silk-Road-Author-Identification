				I want to offer smaller samples in order to gain full trust with the buyer community and get good product to some ppl with less coins but..... Couldnt other sellers of a similar product just buy small cheap samples with a buyer account they created or one from before they were a seller and make unfair bashes in my feedback to up there reputation and ruin mine? Is there anyway to weed out these types? I was thinking of offering refunds on samples if i suspect this is happening, but if you offer a refund, are they still allowed to give feedback? Im not here to compete and bash other sellers at all, im just here to sell my products and make my customers happy. Am I just being paranoid? Would you be? Do other sellers ever get jealous and do this? or is their basically no way to know or find out even if they did and I should stick to what Im doing? which is trying to build my rep slow and perfect as to hopefully avoid scams like this?

				Every strategy contains risks...decide the level of risk and then act.<br /><br />I am a recent vendor (a couple of months here). Have a look at my stats, feedback, numbers of trades and quality of my service.<br /><br />Ultimately you build a reputation by your actions/interactions with the road.<br /><br />I am so grateful for good advice - to embark on forum debate, and add to the quality of advice here...to offer samples to reputable buyers (you can tell from stats a great deal...if not from this, interact and take your instinct decision again)<br /><br />There is very little likelyhood that the scenario you paint is going to happen in my experience or opinion for that matter.<br /><br />It&#039;s a waste of time and why fuck with someone who is just starting out...the road has sufficient vendors/customers to satisfy and seems to very well moderate itself with forums and feedback mechanics. I think the inherent features help a great deal in this.<br /><br />I&#039;ve dealt with a couple of idiotic people, but I have to say, that of my 300+ transactions 99.9% have been really great to deal with, honest, friendly and full of mutual respect for what is being achieved.<br /><br />Hope this helps and good luck friend...<br /><br />Doc<br /><br />

				It is possible, but haven`t seen others do that. Just make sure you dont take all of their buyers :) The same could be done to an old vendor.

				Well thanks for all the replies and advice/sharing your experiences, it all helps and gives me some things to consider. In my local game experience, I agree, being consistently straight up and honest goes a long way and wont matter if an asshole here and there tries to screw shit up, thanks again! <br />~L8erJ.W.~
