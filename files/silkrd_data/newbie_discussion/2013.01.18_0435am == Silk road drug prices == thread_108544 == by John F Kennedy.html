				Even though this is an online marketplace, the time of the year matters.<br />Weed is cheap now, harvest was 2 months ago. Wait 8 months from now. Only growers are expensive hydro indoor growers, or outdoor growers that want interest for holding onto product for 8 months. <br />MDMA and LSD (IMO) depend on how close it is to festival season. When it isn&#039;t festival season demand is lower, so prices go down.

Being able to buy pure definitely ends up being much better for the high and sometimes even more cost effective as well.

				People need to remember we are all around world here. its not like we all live within a 100 mile radius. some things are cheaper while others aren&#039;t. if you compare the prices of XTC coming out of germany to the prices of another country you&#039;ll notice a big difference same thing with weed. one real difference i can say is if you do your research when choosing a vendor you&#039;ll will get consistently good quality. its the same on the streets but requires a lot more work and a lot more networking between people then silk road requires.

				Depending on where you live on this world, prices might lower, or higher. than in real life<br /><br />If living in Europe, prices might be a bit higher than in real life, but what do you expect, selling on here is a lot more work than selling on the street.<br />I also think if buying from the right seller (mee!!) the quality standard is way higher than on the streets, like how it is with my cocaine! So it&#039;s definitely worth it, even if you *think* it&#039;s a little cheaper on the streets. Also keep count that 1 gram is 1 gram on here. While on the streets &quot;1 gram&quot; is actually somwhere between 0.6 an d 0.8g.<br /><br />If you live in Australia for example, i can imagine cocaine bought from an european seller is way cheaper than the local prices, so then it&#039;s definitely a good deal.

				Yea but I assume the higher quality makes it worth it for them. The molly prices are insanely cheap though which is why I buy that mainly. Weed is ridiculously priced here but I also live in a place where it is legal to own and will be sold in stores in a year. I feel seriously bad for anyone who says their street prices are similar, makes me want to take a road trip. I can not comment on heroin or anything else like that as I do not take it.

				Prices are all based on where you live, time of the year, and who you get your stuff from. <br /><br />In my life, I&#039;ve at one point, I&#039;ve lived in Texas. <br /><br />In real life, you could find coke around 25-30 a gram. Unsure of the quality but very nice stuff non the less, definitely not bunk. then on SR, prices range from 80-as high as 200 a gram from some vendors. Prices here are central, so while some people may be able to get it cheap, a larger percentage have to pay more, meaning on here, where the prices are based on everyone together, that means the average price will be higher. <br /><br />On here, marijuana prices are very nice, I&#039;ve seen mid grade dro for around 120-150 an oz which is very nice, considering where i&#039;ve lived the same bud would sell for at the lowest 250.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s also Ruderalis. On sr, i&#039;ve seen Ruderalis, i.e brick weed, go for up to 130-140 an oz. at the same time, In texas, you&#039;re able to get brick weed for around 25 an ounce depending on how much you wanna buy, that usually being a pound, bring the total to around 400-500 depending on your connections. In person, the most I&#039;ve ever seen brick weed go for is 60 an ounce, and that&#039;s for extremely well grown ruderalis, that&#039;s bring green and smells great as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;I find the prices on SR to be very interesting and it gives a nice idea of what things are worth in other places, especially since you can see exactly what people are willing to pay<br />

				Totally agreed, there are numerous reasons for using SR, I just don&#039;t use it as a primary source of gear, it&#039;s part of my well rounded staple of connections. It is not a mythical beast that does not have it&#039;s downsides. You can get scammed on here as you can on the street. I just hate how some people on these boards make this place out to be some god send of 100% pure everything.<br /><br /><br />Look guys, the vendors on SR that sell the core set of drugs -MDMA,Coke,Heroin get their drugs from someone off the street just like most legit IRL sellers. There are vendors with different methods of obtaining their gear but most is not dealt direct with the person producing the drugs, you will most likely always deal with middle men, it&#039;s a fact. The vendors on SR just have to promote their product to make it sell, that is why everything on here is &quot;the best&quot; of whatever they are selling.<br /><br />DO RESEARCH, OPEN YOUR EYES, DON&#039;T BUY BLIND OR HUNGRY.

				Finally found out why I can&#039;t post on the boards! Never noticed ye newbie section!<br /><br />Anyways I&#039;ll contribute.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;ve only purchased pills and meph off of SR, and both were the best quality I could find.<br /><br />Pills locally are usually pips or low MDMA 80-110mg which sell for £10, this is a ripoff considering you can get a dutch pill which contains 220mg for around £6 on SR. If buying x100 of lovely dutch pills it works out about £350.. just recently IRL I&#039;ve been offered 110mg pills per 100 for £300. Do the math!<br /><br />Mephedrone is usually all cut to fuck where I&#039;m from or possibly even 4-MEC, again this is where quality and price excelled real life by a large margin. Real, white, crystal mephedrone.. definitely 4-MMC, £15 per gram on SR, or shitty cut 4-MEC irl £20.<br /><br />Just recently I&#039;ve made my first cocaine purchase which is due to be posted out Monday with possible arrival Tuesday-Wednesday.<br />Until I&#039;ve taken the full gram I&#039;ll be unsure. But considering where I&#039;m from 3.5g of coke sells for how much I paid for 1g on here, so I know quality and longevity won&#039;t be an issue compared to whats around my area. I never purchase coke around here anymore due to this fact stated. There was one guy who sold coke £60 per gram but it was average, after that I decided SR would be best for such.<br /><br />&nbsp;

The washed coke which should in theory yield a higher purity rate also seems to attract variable feedback so chose your vendors carefully.<br /><br />

I appreciate not everyone has the luxury of safe drop arrangements but they are not too hard to sort out. The PO box question will continue to be lamented on here, some say they are a good thing, others think they come in for greater scrutiny. If you need ID to open one and are not using fake ID you might as well just use your home address, just remember though that using a fake ID also attracts additional penalties if caught.<br /><br />Keep up with the reading and you will soon be able to better identify the fact from the fiction, it is also a good idea to PM established members in your country and see if they will help you out with info, if you seem legit they will probably answer your questions.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

				Thanks, i might hit ya up if i have any general questions that I&#039;m not sure of after reading the forums.&nbsp; As you said Its probably not the best to use the home address and i would agree becasue my wife likes to open my mail..&nbsp; &nbsp;:o .&nbsp; I&#039;m all about personal use and don&#039;t really have many alternatives and not even sure where to start with a fake ID..&nbsp; Of course the more you do the more trouble it is to keep straight if anything goes south.<br /><br />I useta party c and h a lot 12 years ago going into the real bad neighborhoods and after seeing a lot of people i associated with either dead or homeless I put that behind me and lost all of my connections from when i was younger.. Man getting old sucks.. hehe&nbsp; <br /><br />But now i have a wife, house and stable job.. I find it very hard to get anything other then weed now a days. The last thing i want to do it go back to those old neighborhoods and risk losing everything just to score stuff that most likely is crap anyways.<br /><br />So above all I&#039;m trying to learn and figure out the safest way to get anything delivered for mainly some coke, maybe some muchrooms (both small amounts).. Then figure out the best vendors that do their best to not put the buyers at the risk.&nbsp; There have been alot of posts lately with people saying there getting letters from postal inspectors and customs.. so that keeps me reading and waiting&nbsp; because i sure don&#039;t want to get flagged and on some list in a database somewhere..&nbsp; <br />

				Weed is pretty reasonable at the moment. At least compared to where I am. And you also have to factor in you get to pick your strain, which you obviously can&#039;t do most times on the street. I bought a QP a week and a half a go for about 700, there&#039;s no way I could get a deal anywhere near that price here. If you&#039;re just buying an Oz or lower, then yea most sellers aren&#039;t cutting much of a discount but it&#039;s still slightly cheaper than anywhere else I could get it. They&#039;d probably move more product with a lower price, but a good amount of people are buying at the price they&#039;re selling now so why drop I guess.

				I personally don&#039;t mind paying a little higher for good stuff.&nbsp; On the street or local dealers the quality can be very random at times.. you get some fine purple one day, then the next get some mediocre stuff that just gets you high and doesn&#039;t make you feel stoned or fucked up.&nbsp; in my area weed was going 240 for a half oz.. starting at 60 for an 8th.&nbsp; Coke was $150 for a teener.. or 1/2 8th, and $300 for a ball..&nbsp; and would be all cut to hell.. :(

				I&#039;d say that the best part of SR is that you pretty much know that the quality of what you&#039;re getting is gonna be good, at least if you&#039;re buying from an established seller. Second best part of SR, at least for me, is not having to go out and drive around and maybe find a dealer, or rely on friends to hook you up, cause none of my friends do much other than weed. Unfortunately, that&#039;s balanced out by the danger of stuff getting seized or getting a love letter or something like that.

				bud prices seem pretty fair...can get better deals here if your spending thousands but 240-300 an oz is fair market here.&nbsp; I am close to the border so I wouldnt buy coke here just too costly.&nbsp; pills are also over double what they cost here...but what is expensive as a buyer is good for a seller so no complaints!&nbsp; just need to get a sellers account if you think prices are high cash in!

				It would be more accurate to compare the price AND the quality between SR and the street market. The coke i can get in the street around me - over a million people European city - is shit compare to what i get on SR. The price is maybe 30% more expensive on SR but... no... wait... a gram in the street never weights a gram. If i had a pro dealer with a top notch quality product that weights on spot, i wouldn&#039;t bother with SR. But here&#039;s the fact, SR exists and work fairly good coz most of us don&#039;t have that kind of contact who lives next block down the street. Convenience has a price :)
