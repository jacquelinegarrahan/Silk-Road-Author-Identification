				You again? More bitching and whining.&nbsp; He clearly states you need to FE in his vendor profile.&nbsp; Don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t buy from him.&nbsp; It&#039;s very simple.<br /><br />You sound like you are 14 years old.&nbsp;

				You already started one thread about this.&nbsp; Is another one going to change the fact that you are an idiot?&nbsp; I doubt it.<br /><br />Someone else summed it pretty well in the previous thread:<br /><br />Re: Do not buy from this vendor CHARASBROS = TRYING TO FORCE F.E = SCAMMING<br />« Reply #9 on: April 14, 2013, 04:09 pm »<br />so this vendor clearly states in his profile that all orders must F.E, you&#039;ve ordered from him in the past, having to F.E early, and receiving only 1/3 packages, on top of that, poorly stealthed, yet YOU want to blame him for YOU making an overall bad decision to spend even MORE money with him?<br /><br />get real.&nbsp; quit being a little bitch/

				joolz,<br /><br />I have to disagree. I went through what you are describing. Saw some O and for the price I thought I would take the chance. He clearly states that you must FE to progress the transaction. Shithead scammers are to blame for that. Read some bad feedback and confronted him with it. All he wanted me to do was be patient and give him a chance. That was 2 weeks ago. As soon as I get my ass off here I&#039;m going to go puff up on some fairly decent O that I got from him. The packaging was 100% fucking original and I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to reorder looking at what I have sitting in front of me. BTW I always told myself I would never FE for anyone, and that hasn&#039;t changed. I took a chance and it didn&#039;t bite me in the ass. I will FE vendors that I have repeat business with, at my discretion. Clearly the loss is yours.

				Thank you Ozana.&nbsp; Some sanity in these forums is a nice change.<br /><br />Clearly the vendor is legit because he has many repeat customers.&nbsp; His rating isn&#039;t great so maybe he has some issues (don&#039;t we all?) but he isn&#039;t this giant scammer that joolz is portraying him as.&nbsp; This joolz kid thinks if he screams loud enough people will listen.&nbsp; It&#039;s annoying that he keeps creating new threads. <br /><br /><br />Case in point, some recent feedback:<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order canceled, but due to a fault of my own and with good communication from vendor.<br />Will make new order as CharasBros has a fine product.<br /><br />
