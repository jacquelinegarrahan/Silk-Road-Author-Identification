				Got a message today from user njtrgh54wh35 (account registered at 1:58 a.m., message received 2:01 a.m.) with the following subject line:<br /><br />▓▒50 Bitcoin + Free extra 2 Bitcoin=1199.99 (www.bitswing.com)lowest price {last 2 hours}5 Bitcoin=$199.9920 Bitcoin=$489.99 www.bitswing.com30 Bitcoin=$699.9940 Bitcoin=$899.99 New<br /><br />Obviously I&#039;m going to delete before opening, but I was just curious, has anyone else seen this kind of spam? Or have I just been lucky so far? And lastly, what would happen if I clicked it?<br /><br />If anyone wants me to find out, I&#039;ll do it for a bitcoin.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />

				If you have your forum settings so that it shows when you are online, then you&#039;ll continue to get that spam.&nbsp; Set it NOT to show when you&#039;re online and you won&#039;t have to deal with it.

				I know man, I know. I&#039;m just curious about how they would actually get money out of me, or anyone for that matter, with such a blatantly spammy subject. Surely nobody could be that stupid...seriously, not if they were able to get onto SR and everything.<br /><br />And I&#039;m still curious as to what would happen if I clicked the link. I&#039;ll do it for a bitcoin ;)

				Ditto: re: being curious about how this translates into them getting your money. Maybe my grandma clicks links like that, but to even get onto an onion site requires at least a tiny bit of awareness...<br /><br />That said, I almost got fooled by the stupid phishing SR login look-alike. Damn them.

				Good thing you caught it before giving your pin and all. How do you end up at a phishing site anyway? I&#039;ve always used the same URL and had no problems.
