				...been using SR for a bit now and am completely stoked. I wanted to pass on my complete and total satisfaction with what has turned out to be my goto vendor - NOD. After multiple transactions I have yet to be let down by the service or quality.&nbsp; No worries here, mate!<br /><br />Long Live the Road!

				I wanted to reply to this, as Nod is the best vendor when it comes to overall transaction factors. I&#039;ve around around a lil while, but never got around to posted enough to do the official review thread. However like a really great movie, his meth is worth a review post. I have tried most of the other main vendors, and while they are professional, their product cannot compete. I have been using meth off n on for 10 years, and this is by far the best on The Road. And it&#039;s not just me, friends say same thing. If you want your girl to roll her eyes back in her head for a 3 hour session or just get the house clean as can be, this is the stuff. Other meth out there is fine for an occasional user or just to mess around, but if he has what your looking for pay the lil xtra...it&#039;s worth it...why drive a Honda when you can drive an Acura?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried his snow, and H not my thing, but I&#039;m sure they stand out too. He&#039;s not lying when he says, &quot;I can&#039;t explain it but it&#039;s just better&quot;. He must have some hella hookups. In addition, to being very responsive, professional, and super easy to deal with

If word about the quality of this product spreads.enough that I can offer superior product at a price that makes it profitable I&#039;m open to giving it a shot.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to expand my infrastructure.&nbsp; If I can increase my capacity to the point that I can can keep up with demand on my other product lines with room to spare maybe I can introduce this product to the community at a loss to get some exposure.<br /><br />Food for thought...<br /><br />- Nod

				Nod was the smoothest transaction I&#039;ve had on the Road.&nbsp; It came quick...like absurdly quick.&nbsp; And it came in a pretty little rock.&nbsp; Uncut, fantastic, no speedy twitches, just a smooth euphoric high that lasted a pretty good while.&nbsp; No blockage in the nose.&nbsp; No shitty feeling the next day.&nbsp; Great look (scaley kind of off white and broke down real easy), as soon as I opened the awesome stealth the whole room smelled excellent like fresh keroseney love.&nbsp; Be careful not to rail it out of the gate...it&#039;s potent.&nbsp; At least for me it was.&nbsp; You know your own tolerance.<br /><br />This is not the first vendor I&#039;ve tried for this product but it&#039;s definitely going to be the last.&nbsp; Nod nailed it.&nbsp; Props.

				I will discuss two things about NOD:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; The price / quality of his product; and 2. How he takes an extreme personal interest in customer satisfaction.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Every now and then, you can find what NOD sells -- in title -- on other vendor sites.&nbsp; Based on my experience with him (a lot) and them (less), the quality of NOD&#039;s gear is CONSISTENT and THE BEST ON THE ROAD.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Hands down.&nbsp; It is worth the extra coin simply because less of it does a better job than more of theirs.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.&nbsp; When dealing with NOD, your problem (logostics) is HIS PROBLEM.&nbsp; I ordered up last week and missed the cutoff and told him I was leaving town and if there were any way he could help out, it would be great.&nbsp; He did.&nbsp; He made a second trip to the post office to express my gear -- I could tell it was the second trip because the time it was mailed, as shown on the label I received, was within minutes of the post office closing.&nbsp; He communicated with me and made sure I had it when I needed it.&nbsp; <br /><br />For these and many other reasons, NOD is simply the best vendor on Silk Road.

				Hey NOD customers!&nbsp; I noticed he received a 3/5 feedback tonight on the same item I purchased and received two days ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;The product was SUPERIOR!&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what this BOZO was up to when authoring that kind of feedback on NOD&#039;s product quality but let&#039;s rally around our man and make sure the SR community knows NOD is reliable in ALL ways -- shipping, service and most importantly PRODUCT QUALITY!!&nbsp;

				I&#039;m new to SR, and spent weeks browsing the site, reading reviews, figuring out how things work.&nbsp; It soon became clear that Nod was *the* vendor to go for professionalism, customer service, and high quality product.<br /><br />I placed my first order and received it so quickly!&nbsp; It was packaged so well it had me fooled until I really dug into it.&nbsp; The product was high quality, FUN, and EXACTLY as described.&nbsp; The day after I received my first order, I placed another larger order.&nbsp; It was even better (how is that possible?) :)<br /><br />So nice that my first experience on SR was so positive...&nbsp; I highly recommend - thanks Nod!

				Hey fellow SRs...wanted to throw out my 2 cents on Nod as well. I looked around quite a bit, and have tried different vendors on SR and Atlantis, but my experience with Nod is the best I have run into so far. I ordered his 3.5 g C last Friday midday, and I had it in the mail on Monday ! I didn&#039;t even pay for the xpress shipping.&nbsp; Clearly, Nod had it in the mail on Friday, and sent a follow up msg on Sun to let me know it had shipped and wanted to make sure he answered any questions I had. You can&#039;t beat customer service like that. I wish other companies in my daily life would be like that !<br /><br />I&#039;ve now ordered a couple times from him and the packaging has been super stealth, and the best packaging I&#039;ve encountered from any vendor. I feel pretty safe based on his clearly thought out packaging. If the packaging is that good, it makes me feel comfortable that he is thinking about security on his end as well. Poor packaging makes you question what else they are screwing up, so Nod&#039;s professionalism is a huge plus.<br /><br />As for the product, the several packages I&#039;ve ordered in the last month have all been consistent, and it appears from same batch. I&#039;m not a coke connoisseur by any means, but I&#039;ve bought enough crap off local friends, ect, and several different vendors to know that his product is what he says it is - good quality. My 3.5 came as one big rock, which was awesome. Grinds easy, good going down, the usual wake up and happy feeling, with no real coming down.<br /><br />I don&#039;t usually write reviews, but I&#039;ve been burned a couple times on sites with different vendors, and I was so impressived with Nod&#039;s customer service, I thought I would add to the other reviews. Any newbies looking for a C vendor, look no further, I highly recommend. The premium price is worth it. I will continue to order from him.

				Hey NOD fans.&nbsp; Someone is busting on our man and we need to stand up and support him.&nbsp; The latest is someone giving him a 5/5 and saying no wonder people give him high marks - he promises free stuff.&nbsp; This is BS. The quality of his product is EXCELLENT.&nbsp; And if repeat customers are so lucky as to get a freebie here and there, then here&#039;s a toast to a damn good businessman and let&#039;s leave it at that!&nbsp; Thanks all!!!
