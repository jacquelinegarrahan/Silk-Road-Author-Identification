				My usual order came in almost a full week late, and now it&#039;s underweight. I was in contact with the seller, whom told me he was reshipping my order since something happened to the other. It comes in now and it&#039;s a full gram under. Should I be concerned and or pissed off?

				Contact the vendor on SR and tell them the order is 1g under and that you,d appreciate it being sent out before you leave feed back, see what response you get. IMO and order should never be under, i,ve had this problem myself a few times and when I contacted the vendor and explained (I used 2 differnt scales just to be safe) they were more than happy to send it out and apologised as we all make mistakes and mine was no where near a gram under! (weed). <br />Just be polite and see what happens, feel free to pm me for any more advise on this or update :) good luck and +1

				Even if you have good reason to be agitated, you will be better served to contact the vendor in a calm &amp; constructive demeanor.&nbsp; Nothing good ever comes out of getting combative from the getgo.&nbsp; Treat people how you would like to be treated, be polite but firm, &amp; ask how things can be worked out for the best of all parties, (save your attitude for later if needed, because if you lead off with attitude, it goes downhill quick)<br /><br />Most vendors are at least willing to try to act professional if you give them a chance by not getting all up in their business right off the bat.<br /><br />NCK

				OP, I thought mary gave you some good advice, and so did norcalking. <br /><br />Carry it lightly. If you feel the light weigh was deliberate, don&#039;t tilt at windmills, life is too short, chalk it up as a lesson learned, walk away and move on. Go find another vendor. Life is too short to waste on scammers or careless amateurs spoiling your day. They only win once. Then they lose you to someone else. <br /><br />To find a vendor you can trust, I suggest you send them a PM to introduce yourself before placing your order. Be honest, friendly, and open in your communication, as you would want to be treated. Then wait and see how quickly they respond, if at all. Grade the vendor candidates based on their level of professionalism, competence, and courtesy. If they do not meet your standards, or seem sketchy, just move on. There are new vendors popping up all the time. Give them a chance. The big shops do not reach out to newbie customers, but the new small scale vendors will welcome your business. <br /><br />In this anonymous marketplace that there is a wide variance in vendor integrity. <br />Generally agree with you, it seems like a crooked roulette wheel sometimes, and a jungle out there. But that&#039;s the nature of the beast. An imperfect system created by imperfect beings.<br /><br />To be treated more fairly, one must go to CO or CA and watch it weighed out in the shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br /><br />
