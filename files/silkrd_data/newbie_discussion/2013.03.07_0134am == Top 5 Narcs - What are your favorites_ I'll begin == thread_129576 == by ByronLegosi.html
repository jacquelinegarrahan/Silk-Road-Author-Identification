				In order please! I&#039;m bored and if someone puts something I haven&#039;t tried then I&#039;ll be SOOOO happy!<br /><br />1) Ketamine (Had the most intense feeling I was in LotR in a hole once)<br />2) Oxycodone (Not anymore though, I don&#039;t feel ANY buzz, even at the 250mg a go mark)<br />3) 2-CB / LSD (It&#039;s just fun right? and I get the giggles sooo bad)<br />4) Morphine Sulphate Tabs (Mainly because they feel a little like original oxy feeling, but not as good =/ )<br />5) Ecstacy (MDMA with a touch of Amph) ;-) (IT&#039;S THE ONLY WAY TO ENJOY DnB and Dubstep on a night out)<br /><br />Feel free to make the list longer into a top 10!<br /><br />Let&#039;s discuss!<br /><br />(Crikey I&#039;m bored!)<br />

				LSD<br />Marijuana<br />Ketamine<br />DMT<br />2cb<br />PCP<br />Oxy/Roxy<br />Shrooms<br />Meth<br />MDMA<br />nBOMES<br /><br />Top 10, not so much in that order. LSD reigns over all for me, but some are just as dear to me as others, meth and nbomes are fun, but I can take it or leave it on both. MDMA ive done wayy to much of in the past. DMT is amazing, but too short lived imo. Shrooms always great, but I despise fungus of any sort, psychedelic or other wise. Weed of coarse. The opiates i love, but they fuck up my body too much, hate withdrawals. PCP is the shiit, but very toxic, so can not be enjoyed as often as Id like, with out brain damage anyway, and the 2cb...well its great lol.<br /><br />&nbsp;OP, I too am thumb up my ass bored. <br /><br />EDIT: seems I got a bit ahead of myself there, thats the top 11 lol

				hi all,<br />i think tryin to rate drugs is like trying to rate ex-girlfriends. <br />but here goes:<br /><br />9.Heroin iv<br />8.Amphetamine iv<br />7. Salvia<br />6. Cactus<br />5. DMT<br />4. LSD<br />3. MDMA<br />2. Mushrooms (lots)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />1. Cannabis&nbsp; (the only one id still try live with everyday)<br /><br />well, that turned int o a top 9, sorry. i love the Psychedelics, but the powders played a special part in my life. thankfully the future is full of mescaline analogs.&nbsp; 2400ug 25i on Saturday was fantastic and should probably be on the list too<br /><br />peace<br />

				I used to be all about this psychedelic woman too. She blew my mind and we went travelling together to loads of great places.<br />Then I fell in love with this chick called &#039;Opium&quot; and I haven&#039;t<br />loved anyone as much since. All we do is sit around on the coach and watch shit TV but I love it!<br /><br />Though, if you can keep it a secret, I often have a real love affair with a lass called Ket (She&#039;s really into horses!)<br />
