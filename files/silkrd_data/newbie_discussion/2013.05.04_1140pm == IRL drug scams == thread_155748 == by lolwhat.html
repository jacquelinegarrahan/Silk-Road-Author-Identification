				Just been drug scammed IRL, cheeky bastards sold me £10 of tinfoil wrapped in clingfilm and £20 of actual grass also wrapped in clingfilm. And there I was thinking Brixton was the drugs capital of London. Sigh.<br /><br />I shall be sticking to Silk Road only from now on!<br /><br />Anyway never mind, just wanted to vent&nbsp; :-\

				I feel like you could&#039;ve prevented that from happening by checking the stuff. I&#039;d never buy from dealers I don&#039;t trust on the street. Always make sure they&#039;re on the level first. Most won&#039;t if they&#039;re smart because it&#039;s not good for repeat business.

				AAh the good &#039;ol days. I remember &quot;scoring&quot; in Brixton once. Dude tried to sell me an &quot;E&quot; wrapped in tinfoil. Before I paid him I opened it, had a look, saw it wasn&#039;t E, and then the guy pulled a knife on me and demanded I buy it off him.<br /><br />Didn&#039;t buy it in the end, and never tried to score in Brixton again!

				Heh yeah I&#039;m considering it an idiot tax on myself for not checking and being so desperate for some stuff I go to any old dodgy dealer.

				That reminds me I had a knife pulled on me in Amsterdam from a guy insisting that I pay him for a wrap of coke that I didn&#039;t really want - he&#039;d just stopped me and shoved it in my hand. I mean, I was there for the weed cakes and mushrooms not a load of powder.<br /><br />Anyway turns it was pretty nice coke and not too expensive so I didn&#039;t mind too much in the end, better than getting a stabbing.<br /><br />How did you get away from your knife guy, just legged it?

				I just pushed him away and legged it.<br /><br />When I first started taking drugs I found myself in loads of dodgy situations like that. It&#039;s part of the journey. I would never have believed that it would one day be possible to buy your drugs by mail order from an underground internet run by a pirate. Pretty cool :)
