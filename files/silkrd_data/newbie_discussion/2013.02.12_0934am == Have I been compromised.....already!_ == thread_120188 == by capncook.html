				hey team<br />I joined the SR community in November 2012 and have placed a couple of orders.&nbsp; Not sure if I should mention countries, but order 1 was from a Euro country and orders 2&amp;3 for another Euro country (different vendors, same country).<br />Order 1 arrived in 3 weeks. Very impressed with everything and quite excited.<br /><br />However order&#039;s 2&amp;3 from the other Euro country did not arrive.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been in touch with both vendors and received a refund on one order&nbsp; and a reship on the other.&nbsp; Basically it&#039;s coming up to two months and no package.&nbsp; I&#039;m figuring there&#039;s a problem.&nbsp; Where exactly is unknown and I&#039;m trying to pin point.<br />Does anyone know of Euro countries LE are targeting at customs.&nbsp; The country I live in they have a border show called &#039;Border Security&#039;.&nbsp; No doubt some of you are familiar with this show.&nbsp; &nbsp;Couldn&#039;t believe it but last week they played a segment when they were at the postal centre filming dogs sniffing regular mail,&nbsp; and the customs workers had singled out the country I ordered 2&amp;3 from!!!&nbsp; To my absolute surprise the dogs sniffed out 3 random envelopes that appeared to have small amounts of coke inside them (2gm-3gm).<br /><br />I&#039;m now wondering if our customs are intercepting all mail from this country and if I&#039;ve been compromised.&nbsp; If I have does this mean I&#039;ll be on some watch list. I also used my real name and address.<br /><br />I&#039;m really pissed if this means an end to SR for me already :(&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t sure if posting the details of the associated countries was good SR etiquette so I erred on the side of caution....in case LE are monitoring.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Haha... <br />Fucken border security..I saw that episode and I&#039;m torn as to whether or not it was just pure propaganda and fear peddling or if that was just &quot;another day at the office&quot; being shown.<br />It also goes to show that simply using basic but proper stealth would have seen all those letters sailing straight on though.<br />Try a small order of valium from the UK or the USA and see if it gets through perhaps?? This should give you an idea of whether or not your drop is hot wittout getting you into too much trouble.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you know for definite that customs are all over the incoming mail from certain EU countries, then order from another. Or get yourself a PO box - or both.<br /><br />Where are you? Can you not just order domestically?<br /><br />Good news re: vendors refund/reship.&nbsp; They probably won&#039;t do it a 2nd time though.<br />

No one will hand you the names of the vendors they are having success with because before you know it they will be splashed all over the forums and success rates will plummet. You will need to invest the time on here and read read read I&#039;m afraid.<br /><br />Secondly change up your drop arrangements, do not order to your home or addresses of people linked to you, it can get messy. There are some options you can use to sever the links to your drops that dramatically reduce your risk (pm me if you need help).<br /><br />I would also avoid hot countries like the Netherlands as they come in for extra scrutiny, stick to safer &#039;non drug producing&#039; countries for more guaranteed results.<br /><br />You could also try pm&#039;ing well established members asking for help, no guarantees but it can&#039;t hurt to ask.<br /><br />There are no easy short cuts to finding your feet I&#039;m afraid, just make sure you stay safe whilst doing it.<br /><br />ssbd<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				thanks for the responses.&nbsp; I&#039;m in Australia and the appeal for o/s vendors is due to MUCH better pricing and product quality.<br />A PO Box sounds like an alternative worth exploring.&nbsp; If there&#039;s any local&#039;s that can provide insights (factual not anecdotal) I&#039;d appreciate it.<br /><br />
