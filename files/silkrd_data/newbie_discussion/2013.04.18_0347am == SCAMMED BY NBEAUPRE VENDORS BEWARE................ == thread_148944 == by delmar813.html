				I am so fucking pissed seriously no good deed goes unpunished. I recently became a vendor and this douche sends me a PM that says the following:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to order a half gram of your #4 H, but I am 0.07btc short EXACTLY right now from being able to order. Can you Please help me out by sending the 0.07btc to my Silk Road username. I can pay you back after I order, when I get more BTC in a few days if you want me to. I would really appreciate this a lot. Please send me a message back or just send the 0.07btc so I can order. Thank You so much for the help with my order.<br /><br />P.S. if you can&#039;t send me the 0.07btc so I can order the half gram of your #4 H then I can send you my address and you can send me a very small sample of your potent H? Just something like even 0.1 of a gram would be AWESOME so I can try it, that is if you don&#039;t have the 0.07btc to send me, or would just rather send me a small sample for free so I can try it out and leave a review in the forums and you can make a custom listing for the small free sample custom listing for like 50 cents or $1, [because I don&#039;t think it can be 0$], with free shipping and then I can order that and you will get another transaction added to your vendor page. Please let me know if you can send this small sample, and if you made a listing for the sample for $1 with free shipping for it, so you can have another transaction added to your vendor account/ page. If you can I&#039;d rather do the free sample to try it out rather than have the 0.07btc to order a gram but if you absolutely can&#039;t send me a sample then if you can send the 0.07btc, [EXACTLY], then I&#039;ll order the half gram of your #4 H. Thank You and I can&#039;t wait to hear back from you as soon as you can. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So I think to myself, ok well the guy is only $6 short he is a new guy.&nbsp; I want his first transaction to go a lot smoother than my first one was when I was new, so I decide to send him the .07 BTC.&nbsp; Wouldnt you know it this idiot never made a purchase.&nbsp; Then I get to thinking if he finds 3-4 people as dumb as me....well he just got to order a small bag for free.&nbsp; NBEAUPRE U ARE GOING ON MY DO NOT SELL LIST AS WELL AS OTHER VENDOR&#039;S LIST. Yes I am an idiot for falling for it, guess it just doesnt pay to do anything nice for anybody anymore. <br />

				That&#039;s retarded man, fucking people these days, iv sold some junk just around town and when it come to that people can be scetchy. It sounds from the message like he was really begging for it so puts u in a weird spot. Hopefully no one else gave him any so it doesn&#039;t really work

				I also got scammed by this guy.<br />He bought some pills from me and he claimed they never arrived.<br />No he is blackmailing me to send money to his account or he will mess up my 100% positive feedback.<br /><br />Is there something I can do?<br /><br />Why isn&#039;t this guy blocked from SR?<br />He appears in a lot of forums as a scammer... How is it possible that people like him aren&#039;t banned ?

				I already heard about this thing being done by another vendor.<br /><br />There are people that contact vendors saying they are short of low amount of BTC to place an order and then naturally never buy anything.<br /><br />Oh well, what can you say? Some people have really no dignity.

				Haha, I was $1 short of purchasing something and contacted the vendor, and told him not to send me money, rather I asked if he could make a new listing or if I could simply send him the money directly, I sent him the money directly. You guys should never SEND them the money, rather make a stealth listing and send that listing, or if you have enough feedback request it through a direct transfer perhaps. This was only a $12 lsd tab though.

				Still someone that does something like that has no dignity.<br /><br />I cannot really understand how some people can really do these things.
