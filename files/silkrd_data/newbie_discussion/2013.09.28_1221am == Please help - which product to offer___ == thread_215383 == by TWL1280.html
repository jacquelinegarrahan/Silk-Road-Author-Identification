				We are offering Cocaine of extreme quality - made in Germany (really) from coca leaves.<br />Our first Batch is almost sold out.<br />We also offer coca leaf tea (grounding coca leaves - one you had it, you never go back tho coffee)<br />In addition, we will start to offer Benzos (XANAX)<br /><br />Every day I receive tons of PMs if we are extending our selection beyond that. Especially, opiate pain killers. heroin and MDMA seem to be in demand. I don&#039;t now much about these drugs, which could lead to a bad reputation. On the other hand, I have very good connections...<br /><br />What is you impression? Can a SR store survive on selling top-notch coke alone or do I simply have to extend?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />TWL

				Cause you can survive on coke alone but only if you have a constant supply. One of my friends on here got a sample off you a big one and they say it is awesome and are really happy to have found a good coke vendor after trying 10 before.<br /><br />Now as for opiates I am quite seasoned in them and it would be awesome to get a new vendor with good service and product and if the coke is anything to go by id love your heroin etc

				There&#039;s never too much Adderall on the road in my book&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If you&#039;re in EU, you might be able to move some pure amphetamine paste at the right price. It&#039;s very rare in the US

				Thanks for the input!<br /><br />We actually will go on vacation next week (hope people won&#039;t forget about us :-) ...)<br /><br />WE wii relocate the shipping to Germany<br />We are working on two new batches, as we are running out so much quicker then expected<br /><br />And, cryngie, we actually going for the Heroin.<br /><br />We have a good amount of Heroin 3 now and working on purifying&nbsp; it, then turning it into No.4<br />I have no experience with this, but one of us has. He&#039;s confident we will produce upper-class China White. I believe we are going to be able to hand out samples the week after next week. the price will be in the range 90-110 Euro/g<br /><br />If we&#039;d only had more man-power<br /><br />Cheers,<br />TWL<br />&nbsp;
