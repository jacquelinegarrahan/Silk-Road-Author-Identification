				Quite a few interesting responses. I can see a pattern of two polar extremes:<br /><br />1. Self indulgence in the material world <br /><br />2. The spiritual part <br /><br />It&#039;s the archtype of Man&#039;s duality - stuck inbetween the material and spiritual. <br /><br />I myself move between these extremes most of the time. But the main point and purpose IMO if you will is to ENDURE. Everything that life throws are you - you have to endure otherwise you are dead. A walking zombie, a non-entity a vampire, and animal.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;8)What did he say? 8grms of shrooms? That must be like eating about 3 of the big ol&#039; psylocibin mushrooms we would pull right out of the cow paddie, and choke down, back in 1969. That psylocibin was better fresh than putting them into an old bread bag where they would quickly turn grey and slimy. Many made tea with them, which was much more hygenetic! But we were usually too fucked up to mess with something like fire or boiling water... I would like to see some of the ground up peyote that came around out west a few times. It was cool stuff, sort of powdered, and it didn&#039;t taste too bad, but it did gag you as you had to eat about a quarter cup of it. Went to float a river one weekend with a big bag of it. We never put the canoes in the water. We were so high I couldn&#039;t get my feet to touch the ground so I just laid out in the crystal clear cool river water and told the passing canoeist to keep their paddles out of the water going through the next long pool just down the river; because there was a 300 lb. snapping turtle that had been snapping off people&#039;s paddles and he could even knock a canoe over! We would watch and about 1 out of 3 canoeist would be holding their paddle up out of the river as they went through the pool sidewards!

				Fuck bitches; get bitcoins. <br /><br />Seriously? I am really into Albert Camus and his philosophy of &quot;the Absurd&quot;. In essence, we are born and then we die; there is no god or overall meaning to anything. This makes everything we do in life fundamentally absurd. But, this overall lack of structure means we are free to decide our own destiny--to create our own meaning where there is none--in effect, spitting in the face of the indifferent universe that created us. I value my own happiness. My happiness is an extension of others&#039; happiness. I get value from helping people out, having integrity and being a good dude in general. Also, I like learning, and nature, and those sorts of things. <br /><br />Hopefully the shrooms are helping you figure some of this stuff out--most people don&#039;t seriously consider these things until they are old, sick, and in a hospital bed, about to die from pneumonia. <br /><br />We are all connected, but that does not mean that there is anything to figure out, no puzzle to solve. Science can tell us a lot, so can our interpersonal relationships, so can drugs. It&#039;s a process, figuring things out, but nobody really has the answers; the more you learn, the less you know. Psychedelics are merely a means to an end--it all comes down to you in the end, not the drugs. <br /><br />We all are dying--some faster than others. Just try to enjoy the ride while it lasts and everything will work out fine in the end. <br />Maybe you should go to YouTube and search Bill Hicks and It&#039;s just a ride, or something similar. <br /><br />As George Carlin said, &quot;Don&#039;t sweat the petty things and don&#039;t pet the sweaty things.&quot; <br /><br />Hope all that didn&#039;t sound too condescending. <br /><br /><br />That&#039;s my .02 BTC. <br /><br />Sending some good vibes your way, <br /><br />TW

				always searching, never still, always getting uncertainty.<br /><br />hoping my first gram of shroom powder, mixed with lemon juice and sugar, that I&#039;m taking alone, in the fields nearby, this weekend, will help shed some light on where I&#039;m headed next. [yes an SR buy]<br /><br />right now tho, i&#039;m marvelling at SR and the amazing DPR and his or her crew, and about to read the anarcho libertarian philosophies (counter economics) that are DPR&#039;s inspiration, and the reason we are addressing this very question, here, right now.<br /><br />otherwise a good weekend of hard sex doses the trick for me<br /><br />top dudes: <br /><br /><br /><br />
