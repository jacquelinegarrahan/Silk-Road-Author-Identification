				Please check out my profile:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9965df269c<br /><br />UPDATE: Things are going well. Slow, but well. Thank you to those that have put faith in my business practices thus far. Due to new procedures at Western Union, all transactions must be kept to $299 or less to remain anonymous. It used to be $1000, so this change has really slowed things down. But keep in mind that there are many WU locations. This requires you to use multiple locations if you are requesting more than $299 in BTC.<br /><br />___I do not ask for a % over the MtGox weighted average___<br /><br />I know it&#039;s going to be tough for me to get up and running, but I plan to become a reliable/reputable source for BTC exchanges.<br /><br />I believe in the Silk Road and I am not here to abuse it. I know that when it comes to exchanging currencies via the SR it can be a little sketchy and hard to trust people. I didn&#039;t pay $500 for a seller account just so I could get myself into trouble. I created this account as a way to exchange my coins for real cash.<br /><br />If you are concerned about being taken advantage of, consider this: I paid about $500 to create this account, let&#039;s start with a transaction under $500. It would be foolish for me to attempt to scam you for less than what I paid.<br /><br />With that being said, I have coins for you. I need to get rid of them. For the mean time I prefer to use Western Union wire transfers.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it will work:<br /><br />--Go to a WU location (google it) and grab a transfer slip. We will agree to exchange using the current MtGox exchange rates. The $ will be wired to me and I will send the coin immediately following receipt..<br /><br />--We will communicate via private message or via my Tormail account (listed below) and discuss what information we choose to use when filling out the form (If under $299 there is no need to provide identification)<br /><br />--I will not require you to FE, but I will not send the coins until I have cash in hand. I cannot stress to you enough that I am not here to &quot;rob&quot; you, but I am also unwilling to put myself in a position to be taken advantage of.<br /><br /><br />__________ I can be contacted via [REDACTED]__________<br /><br />##########<br />Do not direct buyers to contact you off-site.<br /><br />Libertas<br />##########

				I tend to buy bitcoins in batches of more than 1000 usd. Your maximum is too low.

				I know it&#039;s low, but effective July 1, 2013 they&#039;ve lowered their minimum from $1000 to $300&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp; This just means more trip to WU for me.<br /><br />I fairly to the game of trading coins.&nbsp; When I get the time I&#039;ll research other options.<br /><br />BOB
