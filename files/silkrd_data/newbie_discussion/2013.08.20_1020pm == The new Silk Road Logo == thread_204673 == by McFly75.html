				Hey my friends,<br /><br />i am on SR since November 2012. I love this Community and the freedom we all deserve in this parallel world.<br />But i would like to make a suggestion for the new Silk Road Logo because this market is a strong and growing market that needs the same brand logo and professional visual appearance like strong capital legal companies&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I would love to see a new Silk Road Logo on blotters, pills etc. That would be awesome. Imagine that only the best pills and LSD Blotters earn the SR Logo&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />HERE IS THE LOGO<br /><br />http://www.anonmgur.com/up/4c9666e5f65e8aa8562b4ba4706fc282.jpg<br /><br />:-) Let me know what you think<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I actually like the current logo a lot, I think it looks good and works well for the site. I agree that the site/layout could possibly benefit from a small visual upgrade, but not the logo. It&#039;s unique in that it&#039;s not a minimalistic vector image like most companies have. Also the guy on the camel seems mysterious to me. What is he looking at?? What is he thinking about?? We&#039;ll never know...<br />He seems to embody the spirit of the silk road to me. Just my opinion. I really hope the admins never change it.

				Before the digital age, and many thousands of decades prior, they used camels to shift stuff they still do. Country to country is different some prefer mules, elephants, pigeon&#039;s, people, I could make a real long list.<br /><br />Camel ; Logo is too branded changing it would be like NIKE changing to 5 stripes.

				i totally agree with you. as is said. it should just be a tiny redesign without removing the elements. i also love the&quot;look&amp;feel&quot; of the current logo. but the font isn´t really good. <br /><br />just take a look at my profile avatar. it is very very close to the current logo. i only added a half-moon<br />and changed the font and the position of the elements.<br /><br />if i could get the vector file from the logo, the &quot;camel rider&quot; would look exactly like in the current logo<br /><br /><br />NO NEW LOGO. SAME ELEMENTS. BUT A LITTLE RE-DESIGN.<br /><br />

				yea the logo could use a touch up. <br />I would love to see the logo become a sign of an excellent product. <br />the original ideas behind the logo are important to keep in mind, i agree with the fun roulette and his views on the logo and its symbolism. <br />but I wouldnt mind submitting designs and it could be a sweet contest idea!

				The Silk Road is an actual road in history. It was used for transportation of goods to different places, I believe it was in the middle east. I can assume that camels were the main mode of transportation so one might come to the presumption that is where the camel came from :D<br /><br />I like it!<br /><br />

				Ok guys, here is a first try of the new logo, without touching the original elements.<br />I just followed Rocknessie´s advice to put the pirate on the camel. <br /><br />Here it is:<br /><br />http://www.anonmgur.com/up/4c9666e5f65e8aa8562b4ba4706fc282.jpg<br /><br /><br />I really believe both should build a unique brand logo<br /><br />The camel and DPR would make a wonderfull stamp for pills or imagine a full LSD Sheet with the complete logo. <br /><br />We should start a contest for the big bulk manufacturers here on SR ;-)<br />&quot;WHO MAKES THE BEST LOOKING, STRONGEST, CLEANEST PILLS AND BLOTTERS WITH THE LOGO.&quot;<br /><br />I am not saying that because i have done the logo. but i like the idea of a slightly re.designed logo.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br /><br /><br />
