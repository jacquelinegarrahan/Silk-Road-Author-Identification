				There don&#039;t seem to be many positive responses to bitinstant&#039;s new &#039;beta&#039; system. Whatever they did it looks like they screwed it up bad. I&#039;m not planning to use them again. If you want BTC in your account fast, look in the services section for vendors who will take MoneyPak or Reloadit or Vanilla Visa and give you a BTC transfer. That is fastest.

				Go here http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm if you have a bank of america near you.&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually use bitinstant but I am fed up with them not being fixed their site correctly.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t give up personal information to bitinstant they may share with government agencies if asked.&nbsp; Probably not a huge deal though.

				Right there are other options depending on how anonymous you want to be. I&#039;m just saying the fastest way I&#039;ve seen is using say reloadit and then having the vendor credit you the BTC right on SR. No waiting for the six blockchain confirmations. Just make sure you pick a good vendor with positive recent reviews. And _read_ their instructions before buying anything; some have certain minimums, or certain ways you must purchase the card, etc. Generally you do _not_ register/activate the card yourself before giving them the # that would be bad. Yes the fees can be sort of high 10-20% but considering how anonymous and fast it is it is a great way to get started on SR. Blue Sky Traders is nice but I think they have a $400 minimum and you need to have a Bank of America branch close enough to you to do the deposit.

				ok so im back with some updates. for some reason the image verification wasnt working and i couldnt reply to any threads<br /><br />before i posted the thread i tried with coinbase, they are still holding my funds until monday<br /><br />i tried localbitcoins with moneygram and western union and both gave me a hard time about verification. moneygram flagged my order and even called me to ask what the transfer was for. maybe i would retry localbitcoins but for now im turned off by MG and WU.<br /><br />did a cash transaction with bitinstant, got the coins within an hour<br /><br />the best method mentioned here was getting a vanilla reload and trading it to someone on the road, i think thats the method i will mostly use from now on<br /><br />thanks everyone!<br /><br />
