				Ok so I tried making a Mt.gox account, but when I did it asked me for a code verification that was sent to my email, i tried first with a fake email, but then used a real one and never got an email code from mt.gox<br /><br />So i made an account with Blockchain.info.&nbsp; I made a pdf file and went to walkmart, i filled out the blue form and gave it to the dude.&nbsp; I was standing there for about 15 mins as he was trying to make it work and ultimately he told me, your last name does not match with the name on the account. Blockchain NEVER asked for neither my first nor last name.&nbsp; It only asks for an alias.&nbsp; Does that mean i have to use only my alias on the blue form at walmart?<br /><br />I also tried btcquick.com but when i check out does it ask for my debit card info or does it eventually give me a pdf to go to the bank or something like walmart?<br /><br />Thanks for the help everyone!

				If you are in America, I would actually recommend using cash deposit through moneygram with bitinstant. You do not have to create accounts or provide legal documentation.

				I just used bitinstant 2 nights ago. You use money gram to send cash to zip zap who sends to bitinstant who then sends it directly to MtGox. Now obviously you have to have a MtGox acct and the instructions are very easy to follow under add funds then choose bitinstant and use zip zap because they will have a pre-filled form so money gram knows it is for a bill, that&#039;s all, you are paying a bill. Who cares about real names at MtGox there are much bigger fish to fry then us. The big thing with this bitcoin business is money laundry, BIG MONEY.&nbsp; &nbsp;Relax and follow directions..

MtGox has also been coming under increasing pressure and scrutiny from government institutions, which is why they have had to increase a lot of their AML measures. I do not feel comfortable trusting them with my money at all.

				BitInstant sounds nice, but is there more fees on top of the 4% they charge?<br /><br />I&#039;ve used Mt.Gox but the waiting time for bank &gt; Dwolla &gt; Mt.Gox is excruciating.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found another site that works decently but most people that don&#039;t use Mt.Gox wouldn&#039;t use the other site as well due to anonymity issues.

				Walmart usually works fine.&nbsp; However, the customer service rep needs to know what they are doing, otherwise, it will get screwed up.&nbsp; Many people use different identities and are able to complete the transaction.

				yeah walmart is straight,3.99 for bitinstant.3.95 for zipzap,nothing for walmart,just flirt with the cashiers when u go. they will be nosy if u r spending thousands a month on payments to a processing company. i look real professional when i go,even got buisness polos made up. i say this is the only way i can pay my wifes alimony and know that she actually got it. haha, but yeash switch it up every once in a while like cvs or somewhere else like latin stores.
