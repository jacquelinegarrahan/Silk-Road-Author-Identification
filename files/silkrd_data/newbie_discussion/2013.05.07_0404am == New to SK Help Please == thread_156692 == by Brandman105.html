				Hey everyone. Im new to SK and I think the site is completly awesome. So my question is, does anyone know of a less expensive way or getting bitcoins. My income isnt very great and sometimes these bitcoins are crazy expensive. <br /><br />I lost health Insurance, so I can no longer get my prescription, so SK would be such a life saver, if i can come across bitcoins at a some what lower cost..<br /><br />Thanks for the read or the replys.

				you can &#039;mine&#039; for bitcoins with your computer to get them for free... i&#039;m not 100% sure on how-to, but there are guides out there. <br /><br />other than that, wait for the BTC price to go down and buy when theyre low. sell/buy things when they&#039;re at a higher value. theyre very unstable and go up and down rapidly.<br /><br />sorry but i doubt you&#039;ll find bitcoins below market value.

				For the most part, straight buying them is really your only way to go.&nbsp; There are a few sites that give away free BC (but very very low amounts) and some where you can do things or sell things for BC.&nbsp; In the end, though, it is a form of currency that just happens to fluctuate a lot.&nbsp; This is essentially like saying can anyone give me a hundred euros for only a couple bucks?&nbsp; I&#039;m broke.&nbsp; If you&#039;re super lucky maybe someone will take pity :p&nbsp; Anyways I just got&nbsp; a job literally only because I want to buy more shit on here.

You can check out the following part of the Silk Road Wiki for information on how to obtain Bitcoin:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Getting_Bitcoins<br /><br />Libertas

				The prices are generally fixed by dollar amount, so as the value of BTC fluctuates you&#039;d need more or fewer BTC to buy product.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to buy $100 of stuff, expect to deposit $110-120 to account for cash deposit fees, trading fees to convert to BTC, SR markup, and of course to have a cushion for the volatility of BTC market value in the time that this could take.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have said $100...then unfortunately there&#039;s no quick way you can get that except investing in a smaller amount and praying the price goes up...

				Thanks everyone. But im not looking for pity. Just had some hopes and dreams that maybe someone had a secret or two to share lol. But could anyone tell me is there particular times, and or events that can cause the $$ amount of bitcoins to rise/drop.
