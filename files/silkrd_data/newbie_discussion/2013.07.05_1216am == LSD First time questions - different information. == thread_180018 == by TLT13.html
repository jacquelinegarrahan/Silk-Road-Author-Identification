				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m going to get some acid soon that&#039;s advertised as 120-150 micrograms, sold as 110ug (I assume that means they guarantee 110ug, but most likely it&#039;s between the earlier two parameters?).<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;ll be my first time doing LSD and any sort of psychedelic really. The only drugs I&#039;ve done are alcohol and MDMA (very experienced in both). I&#039;m going to do it with a friend who I regularly do MDMA with and another friend of us is going to sit. He often comes to parties where we use MDMA but never has used anything, but he&#039;s very cool with us using and wants to make it a good experience. He&#039;s also not much of a talker and I&#039;ve heard that helps, because it might take you out of the trip if you&#039;re constantly talking with someone who&#039;s not tripping? He&#039;s a smart/safe guy who can kinda let us do our thing but will make sure we&#039;re not in any danger.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a &#039;to-do list&#039;. It includes information for our sitter on what to do when we have a bad trip (make us realize we&#039;re taking drugs, tell us it&#039;s going to pass/calm us down, appeal reality), but also good music, movies, trying different things (comparing view with sunglasses on/off). <br /><br />Our setting will most likely be outside. It&#039;s a meadow/field where we played as kids and we still go there every 2-3 weeks in the months it&#039;s nice weather. It&#039;s near a forest and we have built our own little campfire site and we regularly have bonfires there. It&#039;s mostly tall grass and forest with no people around. I know it&#039;s recommended to trip for the first time inside but we all come to our hometown on weekends from different universities so if we want to trip together we have to do it there, and we can&#039;t do it inside because of parents. <br /><br />Some questions I have:<br />1. Dose. Should we take one tab for 120ug the first time or two tabs? Some people say stick with +-100ug for your first trip. Others say 200ug is the minimum for a real trip. We&#039;ve never had any psychedelic experiences (I don&#039;t even smoke pot). How long is the trip expected to last if we go with a +-100 dose? I&#039;ve seen 6h and I&#039;ve seen 10h, it&#039;s quite a difference. My ideal trip would be like this **** http://storify.com/angelandaddict/brad-does-acid **** (sorry for the story but I find it&#039;s a good description of what I want). Happiness, more colors, noticing small things, enjoying little things, music more vibrant. What kind of dose should I look at to attain that sort of effect?<br /><br />2. Is it recommended to take the tab in one go or should we split the tab in half and take two a few hours apart? (So 65+65 instead of 130). Under the tongue or on the tongue? I can&#039;t find a consensus. After which time can you just swallow it? Some say 5 mins if you let it dissolve well and others say wait at least 30.<br /><br />3. Redosing. If we&#039;re really digging what we&#039;re feeling say 4h in, is it possible to take another tab to make the trip more intense? Or is that not going to do much? Is that going to extend the trip&#039;s time? I know this is possible for MDMA if you do it within a certain timeframe but after say 2h it won&#039;t work very well. How is this for LSD?<br /><br />4. We probably won&#039;t stay in the meadow for the full 6-10h. How weird am I going to be? We might want to go to one of my friends&#039; house to sit inside and listen to music or watch a movie. Is it really noticeable? Am I going to be able to talk to a parent? We&#039;re not teenagers anymore but I also don&#039;t want to come off as a retard to one of my friends&#039; parents who I basically see twice-three times a month and regularly sleep at/have dinner with. On MDMA I have a pretty hard time &#039;acting normal&#039; .<br /><br />Sorry for the long post and I hope you&#039;re able to answer my questions. Let me know if you need any more information or you have another good place you can direct me for more information.<br /><br />Thank you for your time in advance!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				As you said, a lot of things you&#039;re asking are not consensual. The effects largely varies from person to person. I&#039;ll try to answer within my experience.<br /><br />1) The first time I tried LSD I took 1 tab. After 50 minutes with no effect, I took another one. 5 minutes later I was tripping balls. With 100ug I have a very light trip, with 200ug I have a decent trip. To have a brainfuck trip I need around 500ug. It&#039;s up to you to decide what you&#039;re looking for on the first time. I don&#039;t think nobody can estimate how long your trip gonna last. A 100ug dosage doesn&#039;t last more than 6 hours for me.<br /><br />2) If you&#039;re thinking about spliting, take 100ug, wait 2 hours, and take another 100ug. That will give you enough time to see how deep you&#039;re going. I put it under the tongue for 15 minutes, chew the blotter and swallow. <br /><br />3) After 4-5 hours I&#039;m so mentally tired that I don&#039;t have too much will to redose. Tell me how it works for you. <br /><br />4) If you have to handle parents after 10 hours, don&#039;t redose after 4 hours! After 10 hours after a single dose you should be able to handle casual social interactions, but if you redose there&#039;s a risk you gonna be tripping balls after that time.

				I would say take one tab the first time and do not redose<br /><br />you just want to get a feel for it, then the second time go higher if you feel like you enjoyed it. It is hard to tell if you will be ok around &quot;parents&quot; because we don&#039;t know you so just assume no.<br /><br />It&#039;s not really similar to MDMA at all. Then again I haven&#039;t found much else comparable to real LSD<br /><br />just embrace the strangeness and know it&#039;s all in your mind, and if you learn to control your mind you can control LSD, and if you can do that, well shit, you&#039;re ready to control anything

				Says there haven&#039;t been any posts in 120 days so I might want to start a new topic? Guess I&#039;ll just ignore that =)<br /><br />Thanks for the replies guys/girls!<br /><br />I guess we&#039;ll go with one tab and no redose or splitting. <br /><br />Do you think the setting is okay? Also I hear transitioning from one setting to another (inside -&gt; outside or vice versa) can be really cool but also scary. Anything we should pay attention to in the setting/switching settings?<br /><br />My plan is (although plans might go out the window the second the stuff hits me) is to just have no expectations and let myself get taken along for the ride. I&#039;m glad I at least have some experience with drugs, because the first MDMA come-up/hit I was scared as fuck that I had a contaminated pill and the nausea was 1gram of PMMA that was going to kill me ;D Now I just now to embrace it, let go and I know I&#039;ll be feeling fucking awesome in two minutes. Going to try to do the same with LSD.

				eh, I never had a problem going from inside to outside, although being outside just feels better for most people. You shouldn&#039;t really have any plans because you are right in that 9/10 times they just get thrown out the window anyway. Usually I have some weed to smoke as well<br /><br />Just don&#039;t drive on it, never again...

				Anywhere outside is really gonna be fun, as long as you can get home safely (someone not doing it takes you home, or REAL close). Inside is cool too, music, complete darkness, and food and drink are always nice to have nearby, etc. Whatever feels safe to you before you start is gonna feel safe after your trippin. We used to play chess on it, at least until the pieces started moving, then it was all over. I drove on it a couple of times, real late at night. Came up on some ambulances and it felt like a real consipiracy, so I wouldn&#039;t recommend driving at all. Fucking terrifying to be honest. Pick some of your favorite albums/cd&#039;s/mp3&#039;s, whatever your format. I like albums because the artwork is great to watch morphing into the wildest things you can imagine. Give away any weapons you might have, at least for the duration. And finally, you might be able to get away with talking to parents, strangers, while on it but everything&#039;s probably gonna make you laugh histerically. Especially when you&#039;re looking them in the face and they start to look just like jabba the hut and murmer jibberish at you! I would avoid that scene if you can. Have fun. Be safe.

				some guys wrote already their points of view to which I totaly agree.<br /><br />I just want to add also some of my points.<br /><br />1. when you have a sitter and you do it in the nature with no people around, you could even try to take one and a half blotter. remember set and settings are important and do not forget that all what you see or think is just in your head, you are the creator of a bad trip (I am sure it will not come, just relax, nature is a perfect place for the first time). From my personal expereince I regretted a bit after my first time that I did not take 2 blotter. Although I must say even after one blotter I tripped balls&nbsp; :o<br /><br />2. redosing is possible after 2 hours. first look how you feel after 2 hours. If you really want to redose, then start with one blotter and then drop another one 2 hours later.<br />3. it can be you will not be able to sleep. LSD has effects of 8 till 14 hours. I usually take acid very early in the morning or very late in the night. Like this I know after 18-22 hours I will be definitely sleeping&nbsp; :)<br />4. seeing your friends parents is may be not the best thought. you do not know how you will feel after you drop the acid, may be all is fine or may be you do not feel social or may be you are so stoned that they can notice you are on drug. <br />5. and once again: relax, think positive, enjoy the nature around you. it is a good thing you have your good friends with you, you will definetely apreciate that. and do not be afraid, just let it go and enjoy it.<br /><br />I am really jealous but also happy for you that our world army of LSD users will get soon other 2 members&nbsp; ;D :o 8) ::)<br /><br />peace

				If you&#039;ve never taken it b4 100 ug seems to be a nice safe trip. 200 would be an awesome trip, but for me when I&#039;m scared and worry that I might not come down, I&#039;m having an epic time. Just don&#039;t expect to sleep that night. Redosing after a few hours is pointless for me after a few hours cause my tolerance is already too high. Always try to take the right dose at once. I guess if you must, I wouldn&#039;t wait longer than 2 hours. <br /><br />I&#039;m gonna try and throw down with 600ug of dolphin ying yang tabs tonight and see where my head goes.

				Tripping in the house with the right set &amp; setting is the best idea.<br />You can correct bad things if you know what are you doing. Make yourself a better person.<br />Read in google how to make a good atmosphere.<br />I heard there is information about s&amp;s on swiss sites.<br /><br />Thank you<br />YCTT

				I&#039;m going to ask one more question and then stop harassing you guys! <br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading about how the trip progresses a lot. Is it true that as far as intensity goes it&#039;s different for every person or is it also the dose?<br /><br />For example, some people seem to be feeling the effects after 30 minutes and then they are also immediately on their peak for about 6 hours. Others say it&#039;s really gradual and the peak only comes after 3-4 hours. <br /><br />If I&#039;m going to do 1 blotter of 100ug and put it on my tongue, swallow after a couple of minutes, when should I expect to peak? <br /><br />Thanks a lot. I love reading all your replies and I&#039;m really looking forward to the trip. Another 2 weeks, can&#039;t wait!
