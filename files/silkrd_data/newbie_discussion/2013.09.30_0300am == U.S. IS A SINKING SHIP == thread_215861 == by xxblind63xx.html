				First off, hello, xxblind63xx here&nbsp; ;D newbie to the forum but have been a member for a while now. This is my first post and it something that I have had on my miind for a while and I thought yall could tell me what you think. Not really trying to rant or anything but its my personal belief, and of many others,&nbsp; that this government &quot;United States of America Inc.&quot; is going down in a blazing civil war. I think we are gunna have some Purge type shit going down. Not what I want to wake up to in the morning. Basically what I think is that the u.s. has thrown us down into the bottomless abyss we know as debt. So far down that they have no choice but to abandon all ships, do away with the u.s. dollar, shut down the government and leave us with&nbsp; bunch of paper in our hands. Nobody would have jobs, food would be scarce, and man will be savage. I am really not looking forward to that. Everybody I know is so caught up in this damn lie of a life that they live to give second thought about what i say. So Im saving up little by little and im planning my survival. Why I thought to come to silk road was because we all know the value of drugs. They can put food in your mouth and clothes on your back. Everybody who will be really hurt by this economic meltdown probably doesnt know how to sell or barter very well. I do. We do. Shits going to hit the fan and people are going to want to get away from it all. People are going to want to get high. Drugs are in everlasting demand. Im going to be blunt, I WANT TO START AN EMPIRE. Im tired of being the low life drug dealer, Im ready to be on top. It may be in infamy but bitch i&#039;ll be famous. But thats not for a little while. Right now I really want to talk more with people who might have a little more insight on my thoughts about the states.&nbsp; Thanks in advance :)
