				Thats nice to know! Don&#039;t give me that temptation, the price is really good though. Got some of Shines stuff hopefully arriving tomorrow (his premium) so depending on how that goes down (or up sorta speak). The price just seems to good to be true. Any idea when the lab results will be back?

				Hey Pureflakes,<br /><br />Everything you say seems really great! One piece of advice, if you&#039;re open to suggestions, is to post a photo of your product with your name on a piece of paper beside the product; similar to how other vendors have done. Personally, that would give me the needed confidence to go ahead and place an order with you. Thanks
