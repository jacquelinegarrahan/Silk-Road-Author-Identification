				It depends on the vendor, really. Some seem to have no qualms about doing business with new buyers, while others prefer to deal only with buyers who have proven that they aren&#039;t likely to try and pull any fast ones.

				I have been on SR now for about a month, so far 6 transactions with no problems. I think the important thing is to carefully read the vendor&#039;s page so you know how your order will go down.

				at the beginning i suggest dealing only with vendors that say on their profile dont require FE from anyone.. Once you build up stats then can buy from anyone and not have to FE

				When I started and I had only very few purchases (less than 3) I usually always contacted the vendor by PM first to introduce myself and make them understand I was there to do legit business.<br /><br />I personally think that if you do this and you are serious also with vendors that usually say they don&#039;t sell to newbies you will have no problems. The vendors that don&#039;t sell to newbies it is because of the fact that some new users are scam and some don&#039;t really know what they are doing and so they waste the vendor&#039;s time for nothing (as in asking how to obtain BTC etc.); if you prove you can handle yourself and you are serious they have absolutely no problem on making deals with you (and why should they?).

				I&#039;ve come across some vendors who say &quot;I have no problem with a new buyer with low stats&quot;. Which is comforting. <br /><br />Others want you to FE. - I did FE once, for Coke from Germany. It came, and it was goooooooooooooodd!!<br /><br />Though I know I took a risk, either way you take a risk, right?<br /><br />I mean, you could have 5 orders in, and the site could crash! <br /><br />Or be taken down all together. - Better to be in escrow if possible, but if you have to risk it, make sure it&#039;s an amount you&#039;re willing to lose,<br /><br />because it&#039;s always possible you will. The German vendor I used had over a years time, and a 97% feedback rating.

				I personally am fine with noobs as you call them, just ask them to FE first.<br />If Vendors stats are trustworthy then no problem.<br /><br />FT

				I am a relative newbie too and I haven&#039;t been asked to FE on any of my transactions which have all been relatively low value. I think communication helps build relationships so introduce yourself first (I didn&#039;t but now I think about it that was maybe rude of me given my lack of stats at the time).

				I&#039;ve been asked to FE for my 1st buy, which I&#039;m crossing fingers is cool since I have had excellent communication with the vendor and the vendor seemed the most legit after reading his profile.&nbsp; I mean as legit as I can feel.&nbsp; &nbsp;But yeah, if you&#039;re going to FE make sure it&#039;s an amount your comfortable with loosing, &#039;cause you never know,
