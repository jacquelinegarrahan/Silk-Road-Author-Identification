				Hello, I brought 10 adderall from a vendor. He shipped the product and I got it pretty fast. I was about to finalize it, but I don&#039;t see him selling anything anymore. He had atleast 10 different products, now all his item are gone. I was thinking to myself why is he gone? Is his adderall fake or old? <br /><br />What could be the problem here. The seller had a 5 star feedback with atleast 30 different customer. I am confuse why his page is not showing up anymore.<br /><br />Another seller I know changed his name, that I did not buy anything from yet. I just messaged him 2 weeks ago and he messaged me back saying he will be under a different name. He also has good feedback.<br /><br />I have not taken the adderall yet as I am confuse with what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />You cant see their feedback also anymore. Here is another thread about this issue.<br />https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=207844.15<br />

				no he or she did not sell it. there was thousands of quality left of many stuff. he is not even replying. I saw a post early on here not on the newbie section but a different section, that sellers might of have been demoted or ban.
