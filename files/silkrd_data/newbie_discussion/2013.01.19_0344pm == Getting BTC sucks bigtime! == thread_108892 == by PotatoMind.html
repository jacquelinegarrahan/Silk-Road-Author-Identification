				Hey guys.<br /><br />I tried to buy bitcoins today using VirWoX and I feel screwed over.<br />I want to buy some stuff that totals to about 1.21BTC. So I bought a 25 Euro uKash voucher (minimize the paper trail), thinking it would buy me 1.55 bitcoins, more than enough to cover the costs of order. (Keeping in mind the servicing fees etc)<br /><br />Well, I was wrong. Nobody told me I can only buy whole bitcoins. I had to add more money to be able to buy 2 bitcoins. So I had to add money through PayPal which left me a bit uneasy. I&#039;m not so happy about this. I&#039;m seeing the prices of bitcoins going skyhigh over the last month too...<br /><br />Is there an alternative which accepts uKash and doesn&#039;t need rounding off to whole numbers? Now I need to spend 0.79 bitcoins more than I was intending to do and that sucks.<br /><br />This is costing way more money than I was thinking.

				Unless virwox is your only option, I would say you shouldn&#039;t use it. It worked out to maybe 17$ per BTC after all their fees. I could only get 3 coins until I waited a ridiculous amount of time. They also held the bitcoins for 48 hours before transferring them to my wallet. <br /><br />That is horrible service.<br /><br />It is so much easier to find something like cavirtex and walk into a bank and make an anonymous deposit.

Once you&#039;ve used Virwox 3-4 times (I&#039;m not totally sure how long it took to be honest) they stop making you wait to withdraw bitcoins.&nbsp; So I was able to deposit the max amount of currency via Paypal and turn it into bitcoins instantaneously. That made Virwox my normal provider for small amounts of bitcoins, because although they do charge fees, the fees aren&#039;t horrible if you&#039;re only buying 2-3 bitcoins. It&#039;s also the only service (that I know of, other than eBay where bitcoins magically cost $25) that allows you to purchase BTC with PayPal. For larger amounts I use Coinbase because they charge only a few cents and you&#039;re able to lock your buy-in price at the time that you make the purchase, so if the price of bitcoins goes up (which it has quite a bit recently) you&#039;ve already made money before you even receive your bitcoins.

				Maybe I&#039;m just reckless, but I buy my BTC legitimately. I can&#039;t see any way someone would be able to link my sent out BTC to SR. For all intents and purposes I&#039;ve sent my BTC to a personal wallet as an investment device and it looks much less suspicious this way (in my opinion). Of course I&#039;m dealing in chump change and it might be different for moving large amounts of BTC.
