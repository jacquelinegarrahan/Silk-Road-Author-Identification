				This guy scammed me too, $400.<br /><br />Great communication, quick responses, I had checked a few days ago but didn&#039;t see any bad reviews for the guy. Sent him my pak, got the transaction canceled and then I came here only to find this wonderful thread.<br /><br />Great. And I wonder how he has a 1 hour old transaction that has a 5/5 review?

				He also scammed me for a grand. Sadly I knew it was a scam as soon as he didn&#039;t send the funds immediately. But by the time I went to deposit the funds somewhere else, they were gone. Be wary of him, it seems to be selective scamming, or he could just be using fake feedback since his orders are all free. He complained of needing a receipt and having a lot of trouble with greendot over the MP card but it was valid up until I sent it to him.<br /><br />I was looking to pick up some MDMA or mushrooms and would still very much like to. So if anybody on the forum can recommend a reputable MP-&gt;BTC vendor I would really appreciate it.

				So is BrianMcGee legit or what?<br /><br />I saw his I buy bitcoins for CASH in the Mail and he is paying 104 to vendors to buy.<br /><br />I saw his I sell bitcoins for MP/Vanilla/Reload/NetSpend and he is selling them for 101.4.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t make economical sense to buy high and sell low???? All at zero fees???<br /><br />What am I missing?<br /><br />I have not used either RxKing or BST.... Western Union you have to use ID if you want buy serious coins, over $300, and BST is beginning to make the transition to a legit distributor of coins, meaning names and info will be needed to get coins. There are definitely legit anonymous sources for coins here on SR, but they cost money to use. I have used Sugarmama and JumboMonkeyBiscuit, although Sugarmama seems to be out of the picture for now maybe for good, both were very good to work with.<br />One thing about SR I have learned is if it looks to good it really probably is to good.

				This asshole brian mcgee ripped me off too. He actually messaged me first out of the blue and said he had several bitcoins to unload for moneypaks and we could both be doing each other a favor by doing the transaction. I just so happened to be looking to get bitcoins this particular evening so&nbsp; I checked his feedback and seller page and he seemed legit and answered all of my messages in minutes. Then, when i got the moneypak he instantly added the funds to his account and cancelled my order. From there he wouldn&#039;t respond to any messages on silkroad or through his tormail account. I am a pretty experienced buyer on the road and i do my homework before buying and I never would have placed an order with him had he not messaged me first and shown such good communication. The only reason I used him was because my normal bitcoin vendor Vicuous86 was backlogged and told me he&nbsp; wouldnt be able to process my order for a while and when brian mcgee contacted me saying he would have the coins to me within minutes i jumped on the opportunity. Long story short he scammed me just like all of the others on here that have told their story. And to make it worse he is bolstering his own feedback with bullshit feedback of people saying he did great and got them their coins when he obviously is the one with other accounts generating this fake feedback. Please everyone who has been scammed by him report him and tell your story so enough will get through to the silk road admins and this piece of shit won&#039;t be able to scam anyone again. We all have to work together to get scammers off this site.

				yea this guy got me for $2000 in bitcoins i sent him. then he starts really boasting and he replys to my tormail with a message saying he scams all the time and hes been doing it for almost 2 years. He said he has ran about 2 dozen accounts and he alreeady had 2 others ready before he started scamming on this one. Then he says that with my $2,000 he stole in total on brianmcgee so far $23,500 then he takes pictures of all the cash and mails them and so i instantly see it automatically because he was a contact and i saw the image the second i opened the email. From what it sounds like this person works all day scamming and they have alot of money they are investing in scams. you can bet he will be scamming again soon and im sure he must already have a vendor, he told me it was a few months old and hes been working on it.
