				Yes I scored a sample from this vendor when they were new. The sample of Romulon was really good and straight, 9/10 and the speed and stealth were 10/10. Don&#039;t hesitate, I became his fan and watched his profile go up and it looks like he is doing a lot of business.

				All i can say is stay clear of&nbsp; wegotsomeforyou, unless you wanna wait at least two weeks for a package.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I ordered last monday april 8th, and i still have not recieved anything. <br />It was marked in transit Sunday? after a whole week of bullshitting me that it would be here quick. <br /><br />The communication was great when i was trying to place the order, very quick and responsive. <br />As soon as shit hits the fan... NO RESPONSE!&nbsp; Answer you fucking messages from people who have a lot of money tied up with you. <br /><br />Luckily i did not FE, and can not wait to be done with this terrible transaction. All i can say is the bag better be SUPPER fat, and amazingly good to make up for all this crap. <br /><br />It was marked in transit Sunday? wtf? and still has not arrived! Packages should not take more than 2-3 days. <br />Did you sent it priority? <br /><br />I just hope i can get these buds in time for the holiday! or i will be soo sad&nbsp; :(

				I message WGSFY a bunch of times with no reply. Finally he opened the message i labeled&nbsp; BULK right away. Guess he is just talking to new customers right away while ignoring the order he already has. <br /><br />After nearly two weeks and three false promises that my pack would arrive last Saturday, Tuesday, then Wednesday, I am now told it might be tomorrow or Monday. <br />I have been waiting around since Wednesday stressed out and wasting my days thinkin it should have arrived for sure!<br /><br />I have my fingers crossed that i will receive something at least, and hope that it is as listed. <br /><br />WGSFY - DO NOT mark stuff in transit until you actually send it. That is probably the worst mistake you could possibly make.

				Ended up ordering 2lbs from HIGHGRADEDELIVERY,&nbsp; he sent it express, thursday, received today....<br /><br />inside was:<br />a used gatorade bottle filled with water<br />crumpled up newspaper (all from his shipping location)<br />the 4 bags of vacuum seal that were cut off and made to seem like they were opened, however no residue was inside them.<br />except for one in which he left one gram<br /><br />worst scam attempt ever but i guess he did it because of the silk road outages<br />took mad pictures at least<br /><br />just spreading the word, for later, these obvs probably nothing that can be done until the road is up.. poor time to order i guess<br /><br />vanguard

				Vangurd54 received the 2 Pounds that he ordered from me.&nbsp; He then turned around and accused me of not shipping the order in it&#039;s entirety.&nbsp; The order went to resolution where v54 was able to screw me out of 75% of the money.&nbsp; I now always, always check the Auto-Finalize rate and Bitcoins spent on a customers buyer stats when he makes a purchase.&nbsp; I had to learn this the hard way, don&#039;t let it happen to you.
