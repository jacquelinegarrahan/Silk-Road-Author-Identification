				I am seriously thinking of placing an order, but I don&#039;t like the FE.. Prices are out of the world though.

				what the shit! I have required everyone to FE for months!&nbsp; and Im not charging half price on anything. I have sugar leaf aka weed trimmings for 100 and oz. and im doing 100 off for QP and 200 off HP I picked up a few pounds and wanted to get it out. unless you are reviewing my product or service from actual purchases please don&#039;t talk about what you think they are like. I have a fairly large customer pool and I dont think I would have a 100 rating if I ripped even a single person off.

				thanks.. and yeah its more like a 25% off sale not 50%.. but if you become a fan you will see that every couple of weeks i have a sale. then slowly sell off whats left. then restock and have a sale then slowly sell whats left. i sell in waves i guess you could say.

				Why FE! Just write only buyers with more than 15 transaction 0% refund rate and 0% auto finalize rate instead FE!<br />I hate the FE policy, I NEVER WOULD FE ANYTIME AGAIN! <br />I just would order and don&#039;t FE, so the vendor have the work to cancel it, or he sent it away and you make FE after it!<br />Or make tracking???? so many option&#039;s and vendors only want more and more money<br />Thats my opinion, what vendors could do, also buyers with more than 200 transactions also can do! Think about it!<br />Regards
