				Go to the hospital if your so insistent on selling part of your life away (you may have 2 kidney&#039;s but what happens when the one you have left cuz you were foolish enough to sell the other and make the first one have to take on a lot more work).<br /><br />Silk Road isn&#039;t a human organ distribution hub, and I personally am pretty fucking pissed off to see this thread or anybody trying to sell their own fucking organ&#039;s on here.&nbsp; The core hub of it&#039;s users are good people looking to expand their horizon&#039;s or fufill their addictions, whatever unfortunate reason they&#039;ve come to be addicted to a drug being irrelevant.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR is simply a place here to help people who wish to experiment with their consciousness of reality or fufill their (unfortunate) need to satiate an addiction.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a flesh peddling center, and besides ... do you expect to hire a surgeon on here to remove your organ, preserve it appropriately and implant it into the person foolish enough to buy functional human organs off the internet?&nbsp; Or expect anyone to just blindly buy an organ with no evidence you don&#039;t have like hep b or something and just altered the paperwork you should never have in your possession in the first place? (it should never leave the hospital from which it was made if it&#039;s legit paperwork for organ removal criteria).<br /><br />Pine was just taking a lot less angry/rude path of telling you that it ain&#039;t gonna happen then I.&nbsp; Men don&#039;t produce ovum (eggs), DUH!<br />Only way a MAN could sell human eggs is if he&#039;s got a WOMAN tied up in his basement and is extracting them from her monthly lol.&nbsp; I think he (PINE) was being sarcastic ;)

				Yeah, don&#039;t sell your organs.<br /><br />Having yourself cut open is generally something you should avoid.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to ask if you&#039;re crazy, because you are, wanting to sell your own organs is crazy.<br /><br />You&#039;re an idiot too, how the fuck did you think you could sell your organs online? Do you think you could just post a kidney to china?<br /><br />Fuck, selling drugs is not on the same level of shady as selling fucking organs.

				If the Silk Road is used for things like organ trafficking, which attract enough attention from law enforcement to crack a very high priority, and it will not last very long after. Silk Road is currently allowed to exist because it is relatively minor. Closing arms sales was a smart move, and will extend the life of the Silk Road greatly.

				In addition, the sale of organs puts you in a position where you are likely to depend on drugs to stay healthy. You have two kidneys and can get away with, but it suddenly duplicate the work of a single kidney to do. It will start to fail the future. You are purchasing a penny today for a dollar tomorrow.

				Actually, someone raised this point last week by trying to find a beating heart because having a beating human heart turns his girlfriend on sexually.<br /><br />I told him that was obviously not allowed here, but he pushed and pushed until I sought clarification from DPR.<br /><br />DPR said there is nothing against selling organs in the policy here, and he thinks it would be a wonderful thing to offer to people.

I actually have nothing against having organ markets, such as the Iranian one, I just don&#039;t think they are workable on the Darknet due to the level of expertise required in transportation, quality control etc.<br /><br />This is one situation I think we can spare USPS postal inspectors some grief.

				One could imagine a darknet forum for buyers and seller to meet. At some point the buyers and sellers would have to meet in a hospital (possibly flying to Iran for surgery etc etc, all factored into the price I&#039;m sure). However the donor could agree on some cover story (old colleague, met on holiday, whatever), and it would be impossible for any observer to prove that there was a bitcoin transaction behind it. <br /><br />It&#039;s not what the Silk Road is built for though, you&#039;d have to find / start another site.

				Sorry guys, first, i am absolutely noob in tor,<br />second, i did not try to sell, i just wanted to become a voluntary donor, for free. Actually, in contrast to... am... normal countries, you can not be a voluntary live organ donor in Russia if you are not relative to recipient (even if you are spouse to recipient!). So, die first. <br /><br />There are only one case of allowed non-relative live donorship- bone marrow. So, i underwent HLA-typing for St.petersburg center of children oncology, but- there are no compatible recipients for my HLA.<br /><br />Im very sorry to disturb you.

Why, may I ask, do you feel compelled to give away organs for free? Do you feel a strong need to be altruistic? Or is it something else?<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to answer if you don&#039;t want to. Like most people here I am curious.<br /><br />
