I&#039;m trying to get them on my listings at the moment but having some difficulty. I mailed support about it though. <br /><br />Yeah getting established will possibly be long but I&#039;ve come at going on SR from the right angle. Did a lot of research buys to check out stealth methods and quality comparison. People that give us a go wont be disappointed! :)<br />

				I just placed my first couple orders too, some mixed psychadelics for me. I&#039;m feeling a combination of raw excitement and newbish fear that something will fuck up and/or I will fuck something up (I only made small purchases to start just in case so I wouldn&#039;t be losing too much money in the event of a fuckup).

				Well, I&#039;m an American and I believe in buying American!&nbsp; Not necessarily due to chauvinism or patriotism or even to contribute to the U.S. economy, but more for safety and eliminating dealing with foreign and U.S. Customs.&nbsp; I&#039;ll make due with our domestic vendors!&nbsp;

				Just made my first purchase as well. It was like a rush buying the BTC and then seeing it hit BlockChain then to the SR, making the purchase and then seeing it go from &quot;processing&quot; to &#039;In Transit.&#039; I was like, whoa, this is all happening so fast. Haha. Makes me laugh just thinking about it. Of course I had done my research and got in touch with the vendor and everything fell into place like it was suppose to. Of course I did the opposite of what some do and went international with it, ordered in bulk and understand there will be tracking plus a signature required. That&#039;s because I&#039;m hardcore!&nbsp; Or hardheaded, whichever applies.&nbsp; :P Can&#039;t wait til&#039; that thing shows up like paow! Haha. Like someone dropped a bomb in this place.<br /><br />OP Sounds like one badass party kid, stay safe &amp; have fun.

				Just wanted to finish this thread saying all my products have arrived. Two lots of pills, one lot of MDMA, and some LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be testing some LSD in a bit, then a pill in a few hours (Candy Flipping), then testing a different pill and MDMA tomorrow. <br /><br /><br />Massive thanks to Dread Pirate Roberts; all other Silk Road seniors; everyone at BitCoin; the vendors HEADSHOP, Symbiosis, and Technohippy; and of course YOU GUYS IN N00B as you helped me through my learning curve and giddy excitement.<br /><br /><br />THIS WEEK WAS A GOOD FUCKING WEEK.
