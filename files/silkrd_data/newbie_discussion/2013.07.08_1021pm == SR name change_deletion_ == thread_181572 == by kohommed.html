				I have a two part question...<br /><br />Being a newbie and all, I have singed up to SR using a nick which is very easily identifiable on the open web, to the point where it could easily be used in court against me etc etc. This I have no doubt of.<br /><br />Now, I have only been a buyer on the site before, but I have racked up only positive reviews, with a high total tx volume, which I would not like to lose (nothing negative I believe, although I obv do not have access to the seller stats they keep).<br /><br />I really need to do one of two things:<br /><br />1) Ideally, keep my account and simply change the nickname - but only this option if the server logs are deleted after a certain amount of time, so I know that for example in a few months all traces of my nick will be erased forever from SR.<br /><br />2) Delete my account permanently, to remove all traces of my nick, and then start a new account.<br /><br />Please could someone weigh in with if #1 is possible, or what I should be doing about this etc.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Koho

				The way I understand it, you can&#039;t change your account name, but you can create a new one.<br /><br />The info associated with the old account gets permanently deleted after some amount of time. I believe messages after 3 months and transaction information after 4. At a certain point, like 4-6 months after your last login, it gets &quot;archived&quot;, whatever that means. The only thing I know about it is that you can&#039;t log into it anymore. It appears to be deleted. At that point it should have no info associated with it anyway.<br /><br />Make sure you remove ALL BTC from the account and don&#039;t log into it.

				Hey man, thanks for replying.<br /><br />So does this mean that DPR is keeping backups for that long?...Gee, I had better hope as much as he does that nothing goes wrong...&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Do you know the names of any SR admins I might be able to PM on here, just to make doubly sure there is nothing I can do about it before I de-activate my current account and lose all my history.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Koho
