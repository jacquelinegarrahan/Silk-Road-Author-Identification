You shouldn&#039;t be too worried - if you have the same username, note that they now have a little bit of (weak) evidence that someone with your username bought bitcoins. Which by itself is not a problem. If they can trace how you bought them (e.g. subpoena the payment provider), and your &#039;real&#039; identity is there somewhere (e.g. bank account / visa card), then they can correlate the username and bitcoins to your identity. But they still can&#039;t prove that that username has anything to do with SR. So don&#039;t be too worried (particularly not if you&#039;re a big time dealer / similar), but for better safety, use totally unrelated username / passwords for each site, and where possible not associating one identity with another (so where possible don&#039;t tell one site your username on another, e.g. email address).<br /><br />This is me being paranoid, but it&#039;s good practise to think &quot;what could they figure out if they were smart and motivated&quot;, in particular, if one anonymous identity was revealed, would it mean game over, or just that you toss that username/password away.

				While I&#039;m giving username / password advice, it&#039;s worth saying that you should *definitely* use a different password on this forum to the actual silk road site. Forum software generally has a pretty bad security record, and you should make sure that even if someone manages to get at your forum password (through SQL injection, or similar; much easier than finding the server and raiding it), your silk road account is still safe.

				I really really shouldn&#039;t have to tell you to do this but for all the noobs out there.<br /><br />In your tor browser click on edit &gt; preferences then untick the box that says &quot;enable javascript&quot; <br /><br />Next look for the noscript icon next to the onion icon, make sure to &quot;forbid scripts globally&quot; <br /><br />No legitimate person running a tor hidden service will use scripts on their site, Only law enforcement will try and get you to use scripts.<br /><br />It only takes 1 malicious script to load in your browser and next thing you know you are sucking bubbas big black cock in a federal prison.

				I have a few security questions...<br /><br />Question 1) I am running tails Live now, though I haven&#039;t yet created a persistent feature (or know what that is yet). When I try to access SR or clearnet, i get a warning saying that my information can easily be read by a 3rd party. Is this normal? If not what can I do to create a secure connection? It also says failed to synchrnize clock which it mentioned was very important when using TOR..<br /><br />Question 2) Lets say that I was using windows, and like an idiot typed in SR address before tor.check even loaded during the security breach. This might have even happened a few times. <br /><br />Am I still at huge risk even though I never used/visited tormail or anything besides SR?<br />What exactly happens(ed)(ing) to my computer besides my MAC address/IP address being sent to Virginia.

				<br />IMO it&#039;s all a kerfluffle meant to spook the users here. Someone hatched a FF exploit which grabbed the MACs of dark web users. But it was limited in scope. They were just testing it out in the wild, a distraction while taking down FH.<br /><br />You know the USPS does not bring a federal case unless there are very large amounts involved.<br /><br />Likewise the FBI doesn&#039;t care about chasing down a few users. Why would they care about a mere newbie with no record on SR. They are going after the big fish. They are like predators who prowl the dark web alleys and will leap on a big dumb unprotected target that is an easy catch. Don&#039;t make yourself easy to catch. Don&#039;t be too big or too dumb to get popped. Always use protection, they count on you to be lazy.<br /><br />Unless you are very blatant or careless with your orders or mixed up with cp your risk is limited to the BTC in your SR account.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-X
