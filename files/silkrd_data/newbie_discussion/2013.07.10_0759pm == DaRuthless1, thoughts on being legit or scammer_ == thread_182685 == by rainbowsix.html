				Hey, so I&#039;m new here and have only made two purchases.&nbsp; One was through standard escrow, and the second was through FE, which is a total no, no.<br /><br />Against my better judgement I placed an order with them yesterday and FE&#039;d.&nbsp; I went in figuring I&#039;d lose my money but figured I&#039;d give it a shot based on the wonderful history and feedback this vendor has.<br /><br />I just can&#039;t help but think they&#039;re going to collect as much as they can through this &quot;sale&quot; and then close up shop.<br /><br />When I spoke with them, they seemed really nice and very attentive.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m definitely worried.&nbsp; I was told my order would be shipped via Express (I paid extra for that) yesterday and I know Express is by 3pm the next day - though USPS can definitely screw up.<br /><br />So, I didn&#039;t receive anything today.<br /><br />It&#039;s totally my fault, since I shouldn&#039;t have been dumb in making such a bad decision, but I&#039;m truly hoping they come through.<br /><br />Anyone else want to share your experience with this vendor or your thoughts?

				I agree with all of you.&nbsp; Every time they communicate with me, it sounds really nice.&nbsp; However, that&#039;s what usually happens when you get scammed.&nbsp; He explained that my Express shipment did not go out Express, but rather Priority and that I&#039;ll be refunded the difference.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t received anything yet.<br /><br />I&#039;m a very negative person to begin with and never trust anyone.&nbsp; To me this seems like a classic scam, but I&#039;ll give it until tomorrow to be certain.<br /><br />They said they checked my tracking number, but wouldn&#039;t provide me with it, and that it will be here tomorrow, 100%.<br /><br />Every piece of information points to a scam, but I&#039;ll give them the benefit of the doubt until tomorrow.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing I can do anyway.&nbsp; No recourse, so I&#039;m screwed no matter what.

				Express isn&#039;t guaranteed next day, it&#039;s 1 OR 2 days, but, I guess you will know tomorrow. There&#039;s lotsa concerns about this vendor right now.

				DaRuthless1 is just that.&nbsp; When he asked me to FE for faster shipping, blah, blah blah, I politely declined.&nbsp; He gave me the option to not FE, I took it, and he&#039;s now blacklisted me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how he maintains his top rating.&nbsp; He turned very snide in an instant.&nbsp; Glad I didn&#039;t cave.&nbsp; NEVER FE!
