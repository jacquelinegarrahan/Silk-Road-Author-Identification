				I&#039;ve lived in the Philippines for years now and so far have yet to find any opiates!&nbsp; Apparently oxy is attainable but I haven&#039;t had any luck.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone had any luck on this front?<br /><br />I wish I could order stuff off here but the mailmen are notorious for stealing so all my packs wind up missing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried twice.&nbsp;

				What the fuck? seriously? fucking scum bags, I live in -------- and i&#039;m thankful that I received my orders... Whatever the mail company is, they should get sued, maybe get a friend to mail you something that could be suspicious (but isn&#039;t), and make sure you have evidence that you are expecting it and sue their ass if that faggot mailman steals it. <br /><br />get a parang or butterfly knife and jump that bastard, I won&#039;t take kindly to scumbags like them.

				@ Hearts: Wow!&nbsp; Do they still have the death penalty for that sort of thing?&nbsp; Well if you receive your orders maybe I just got scammed - both of those orders were from the same vendor.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll give it another shot with a different vendor.&nbsp; What kind of stuff do you order?&nbsp; I&#039;ll try something really innocuous like blotters.&nbsp; <br /><br />@WI: I live in Pasig, Manila.&nbsp; Do you live here too?&nbsp;

				@chowderhead00<br /><br />Yeah drug penalties there are very harsh, 100g of weed is death sentence. I think you might have been scammed! I mean I&#039;m pretty sure the Philippines isn&#039;t that backwards as to have thieving mailmen, otherwise they would have many complaints! And the fact that both orders were from the same vendor must have been him cheating you... I ordered several times no problem<br />And yeah Blotters should work fine! I should be getting 25 blotters of 25i NBOMe by next week, I&#039;m not so worried about them since its easy to conceal. <br />Some tips I guess, just try to look at the vendors reviews and try to judge if they seem genuine, (in case the vendor made fake accounts to rate 5/5).. And the number by the side of his name that shows i think how trust able he is in terms of amount of failed transactions or something, can&#039;t remember and can&#039;t check as SR is down at the moment.<br /><br />Hey and Good luck ordering! I would suggest Just not buying stuff in bulk for the first time, unless its blotters of LSD or NBOMe or DOx, blah blah blah... But its up to you, all my packages came through regular mail so its easier to act like its not my mail if it gets seized, and i&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard this a lot, but unless your vendor asks for you to sign for the package (which 95% will never ask), never accept to sign a package and make sure its clear your vendor told you that if you&#039;re receiving a parcel, it could be controlled and you just have to play dumb and say i wasn&#039;t expecting a package :p<br /><br />Not many south east Asians vendors at all huh? closest I would think is either vendors i&#039;ve seen based in China, India or Australia

				^ Thanks for the advice!&nbsp; Actually I&#039;ve been in the scene for a few years now, just never ordered anything to the Philippines (well, not successfully anyway).&nbsp; But everything legit arrives OK, so the more I think about it the more I think I must have been scammed.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s a well-known reputable oxy vendor situated here (mikee - not from SR) but, annoying thing, he doesn&#039;t ship locally for some reason.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				They are other marketplaces like Silk Road, I hear Sheep marketplace is reliable, and recently hearing a lot about Atlantis, but just be careful either way :) check the hidden wikki for other marketplaces and what not. <br /><br />http://sheep5u64fi457aw.onion.to/manager/login Heres Sheep marketplace link<br />I dont know much about Atlantis though or how to get there
