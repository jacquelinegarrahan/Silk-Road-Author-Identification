				I assume your talkin bout how we like our women, right? I gotta feeling I&#039;m a little older than a lot o dudes on here . I got outa high school in the early/mid 80&#039;s and I tell ya what, chicks had hedges back then down their, if you had artistic talent, you could trim it into cool designs, jungle animals, the solar system,,,whatever. Then, something weird happened, all the chicks simultaneously lost all their pussy hair and, I think elves did this when they were sleeping, tattoos, and for the most part, TERRIBLE tattoos appeared above their asses. I don&#039;t mind the bald pussy look, but I&#039;d rather have a little poof fur of on em, like a soft little Hitler mustache .

				Laser hair removal is where it&#039;s at. Even if they don&#039;t go bald, makes it softer and finer after half the treatments or something...

				Honestly this is a topic of great consternation for me... I can&#039;t stand the modern bald pussy, and I am a young dude. I fucking LOVE when the pussy/lips are waxed/shaved, but with a nice fucking well-defined forest above. There is literally nothing hotter in my mind then the idea of being with a girl for the first time and putting my hands in her panties, only to find a lush and soft hedge of hair. So fucking erotic. Without the hair there, it just loses its innately sexy and elusive nature, the skin becomes no different than the skin around her navel.
