				So I had already made several successful transactions with this guy up until last Saturday. <br /><br />He had put a message on his page that morning saying that he had lost a large amount of coin due to the crash. I placed an order for 15 pills that same day. I pmd him and told him that he could just send me 10&nbsp; as way of a small donation towards his loss. I was willing to pay Â£150 for ten basically, because he&#039;d been great to deal with.<br /><br />Previously orders I&#039;d placed with him arrived next day. After three days I pmd him telling him they hadnt arrived, to which he replied leave it another few days. I reckon now this is to give him time to scam more people. So messaged him this morning and he says he will give me a 25% refund, which is more than he states on his sellers page. Funny how just this week he changes his refund policy to zero for no shows.<br /><br />What really sticks in my throat is I FE&#039;d and offered to pay a bit more for product to help him out. But oh no he just wanted all of my coin to go towards his loss.<br /><br />Scamming bastard.&nbsp; &nbsp;
