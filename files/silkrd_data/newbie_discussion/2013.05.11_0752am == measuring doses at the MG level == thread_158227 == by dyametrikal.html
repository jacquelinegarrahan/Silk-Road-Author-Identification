				Hey everyone, I&#039;m new so apologies if this is breaking any rules or in an inappropriate forum (since it&#039;s the only one!)<br /><br />I am looking for some advice on how to dose RCs that are active at the milligram level safely, short of investing in a milligram-sensitive scale ($$$?). One way of doing it I considered is dissolving a known amount of substance into a known amount of solvent and measuring volumetrically; however, that is cumbersome at best. Another, of course, is blotters, which is cumbersome in its own way.<br /><br />A more interesting thought I had was using some sort of buffing agent (microcrystalline cellulose? or maybe something even useful like picamilon or theanine?) and mixing known quantities of the two in order to end up with more easily measurable amounts. However, if you are mixing like a gram of milligram-active substance x and some correspondingly large quantity of some buffing agent, is this potentially really unsafe? Do you have to go to any crazy measures to make sure your substances are mixed homogeneously? Could differences in atomic mass cause one of the substances to gravitate towards the bottom over time? Are there any risks of chemical reactions between the two substances - how do you know that your bulking agent is inert? Obviously you don&#039;t want to end up with a mixture where you think 100mg = 1mg of active and then end up taking an unbalanced dose. I don&#039;t know much about this but I figure this is the place to ask.

				I would guess that the solvent solution is the most reliable one, but I&#039;m not a fan of RCs so have never needed to do this. This is an interesting problem though, so I&#039;ll follow this thread with a keen eye.<br /><br />Maybe PM one of the more active RC vendors with a link to this thread?

				I know I&#039;m stating the obvious and you&#039;ve already covered the option, but a mg scale really is your best bet friend. Anything else is going to be a guesstimate. Some of the other ideas you&#039;ve suggested are quite good but I guess it comes down to what level of risk you&#039;re prepared to take with putting these things into your own body.<br /><br />A decent mg scale will last you a lifetime so if you plan on indulging in such things for years to come, it really is a small price to pay for your own health and peace of mind.<br /><br />Laissez-faire!

				You pretty much lost me with all the other options to be honest but I&#039;m definitely +1 for the scales option.<br />I remember getting a set just to dose out DMT...partly because I wanted to know exactly what effect specific doses had and partly because I knew doing too much could be a bit of a shock to the system.<br />A few people thought I was being over cautious but they soon got it when they realised how potent it was :)

				Yeah, the MG scale would make sense if that was something I&#039;d use like crazy but I really only want it for two things: phenazepam and etizolam, both of which are so much cheaper as powder than as premade pills. Once you factor in the cost of the scale it kind of defeats the purpose, haha. Although I suppose it would come in handy in general eventually (I&#039;m not a huge RC person honestly, it&#039;s just these pseudo-RC thienzos that have me fascinated).<br /><br />I guess it&#039;d be useful for MXE too tho. And DMT.... yeah, I guess it starts making more and more sense :)

				A milligram scale is a relatively small investment in comparison to the potential that overdosing on RCs has. ;)

				Just get a milligram scale.&nbsp; It&#039;s 18 fucking dollars.&nbsp; For real -- I have the same model from China, it works great: http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368261673<br /><br />Note: if you want true 1mg level accuracy, you&#039;re going to have to go with a 5mg measurement and then cut it up into 5 equal piles.&nbsp; There&#039;s your 1mg measurement: the problem is that the scale generally won&#039;t register anything under 5mg.&nbsp; Also, now that I actually read your problem... this will still be off by 1-2mg sometimes.&nbsp; If you&#039;re dealing with a substance that you truly need 1mg accuracy for... I dunno.&nbsp; Ignore my suggestion, I guess?

				+1 on getting a mg scale. It can be used for other stuff too!&nbsp; Honestly it&#039;s the most accurate way to measure. Even if it costs USD 50 it&#039;s still only a fraction of the cost of whatever drug you use in your lifetime. Safety first and enjoy!

				A scale is your best friend; they are quite cheap.<br /><br />If you simply cannot get a scale, as the poster above mentioned, the solvent method is the best.<br /><br />Just a tiny bit of math and you can measure a dose fairly accurately:<br /><br />1) Get a very volatile and preferably innocuous solvent.&nbsp; This will require you to do some research on what solvent your deliverable lies.&nbsp; Acetone is common.<br />2) Use the old chem forumula Concentration *Volume = Concentration2 * Volume <br />so if you have 200mg of 2cb for example (i know nothing of this chem):<br />--Dunk the 200mg in the solvent. Now you have 200mg/per Solvent Volume <br />--Continue to dilute using the formula above for lower concentrations (MAKE SURE to have enough solvent). <br />--Once you have the concentration, evaporate the solvent (use a lighter).&nbsp; The solvent will keep the product from being overheated/evaped.<br />3) Enjoy.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m sure you already know this judging by the initial post, but PM me if you want me to flesh it out.

				.19 BTC for a mg scale? Fuck yes. That&#039;s nothing, and if you&#039;re dosing heroin, RCs, DMT and the like, you&#039;re going to want it. Get a scale.<br /><br />Plus, I like know, to the milligram, how much weed I get. My friends are greedy assholes when it comes to drugs, so there&#039;s no way I&#039;m going over when selling to them. <br /><br />The people who aren&#039;t jackasses, I just share for free. Lol.

				depending on what material you want to measure.<br /><br />these 30$ 0.001 ebay-scales will do for everything that has an active dose above 20-30 mg. they mostly have +-5mg tolerance, means if you wanna lets say dose 2c-b ... the scale shows 15mg, it still can be 10 or 20. <br /><br />my first scale was one of those and it&#039;s done a good job for stuff like MXE and ketamine, also DMT is no problem with this, but you REALLY do not want to measure 5-meo-DMT or 2C-P with that kind of scale. and DONT multiply and then eyeball equal amounts. <br /><br />for &lt;10mg measurements that are still accurate enough, that it wount send you into ER i recommend something like a GemPro 250 with 1mg tolerance. you can sucessfully measure 8mg and it will not be 13mg as with cheap scales. if you think of 2C-P wich such a steep dosage curve that would be from a normal to a very strong trip.<br />als especially handling NBOMes, where you&#039;re preparing a liquid, you need to have a really accurate scale. too many people died of 25i-NBOMe overdose. deaths that could have been totally preventable, when people stop measuring high potent stuff with the tips of their knife!<br /><br />it&#039;s the best 150$ you will ever invest. in the end, you invest directly in your health with this:<br />http://www.amazon.com/My-Weigh-GemPro-250-Compact/dp/B004C3I3AA

				Yeah, get a mg scale, i bought one of the cheap chinese models two years ago, i forgot the batteries inside it for two years and it turned on perfectly when i dug it up from my stuff.<br /><br />Now that i order from SR, i almost use it on a daily basis.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what i did with some Alprazolam i ordered, but i haven&#039;t gelcapped and tried it yet, i&#039;m not saying my method is right, it&#039;s only a wild suggestion.<br /><br />1. Weigh desired amount (100mg in my case) of Alprazolam or other active substance.<br />2. Dissolve in high proof alcohol, heat it a bit if it doesn&#039;t dissolve all. (I don&#039;t know about Phenazepam and Etizolam solubility, though, but apparently Propylene Glycol is great for that matter.)<br />3. Pour this solution over your pre-weighed buffing agent in a clean Pyrex dish (i used 7.5g of previously extracted Calcium Carbonate from Tums because it&#039;s the only cheap thing i could find that i knew wouldn&#039;t dissolve in the alcohol since it&#039;s chalk-like. I tried microcrystalline cellulose before, but once it was dry, it just formed a thin layer that flew everywhere when i would scrape it off the dish.)<br />4. Allow solvent to evaporate.<br />5. Collect powder, scrape all the edges of the dish with a razorblade, mix it thoroughly. <br />6. Weigh desired amount and put in gelcaps (e.g.: 75mg for 1mg of Alprazolam).<br /><br />I don&#039;t think my method is accurate and i would like a better method in the future, can anyone suggest something better or simple things to ameliorate?

				You could always build your own. According to the instructions this home made scale can&nbsp; &quot;distinguish between masses in the 100-microgram range that differ by as little as two micrograms. And calculations suggest that the instrument can measure single masses as slight as 10 micrograms&quot;.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/hardware/hardware_info1.shtml<br /><br />Never personally used it so I can&#039;t vouch for its accuracy but it seems pretty clever.
