				Hi i just started the whole silkroad experience and i think my first buy might have already been a scam.<br />Basically i ordered an ounce from this guy becouse he had like 300 fans and very good feedback and he was doing a holiday sale for weed.<br />Anyway of course i finalized early this morning and he said he will ship out on Monday.<br />But when i checked more closely like last 50-100 of his feed back was FE&nbsp; Feed back and then like 5 saying its a scam and i cant help but worry.<br />What should i do ? Wait for a week or two till the order is supposed to arrive and then try and somehow prove that it didn&#039;t and get my bit coins back but since like 100 people ordered from him , if he is a scammer what stops him from just deleting his SR and taking all the bitcoins he got from people who he asked to FE.<br />What do i do ?

				NEVER FE EARLY<br />Well, that is unless you&#039;re willing to risk losing the money. As soon as you FE it gets a lot more difficult to claim your money back.
