				Can you tell if he has read them? Open the msg and look to right, it shows if he has read or unread. Not that this helps if he scammed you. Sorry for you. :( How exactly did that happen? He said he would sell you BC? Use Bit Instant for coins, so easy and fast and you are in control of your $ and BC at all times. Good luck.

				My usual vendor for&nbsp; bit coin &quot;TSC&quot; was on vacation so I tried so someone else. My guard was down cause &quot;VENOR GOOD DRUGS&quot; stats are good for a month but its mostly all fake back an he has been planing this...he responds to my fake account an then when confronted he quit responding.....he wont even open mine from my real SR page....No I get my coins from a very good honest bunch on here that sell awesome drugs too an do people right &quot;The Scurvy Crew&quot; is very trust worthy trading coins...cheap transaction fee an no having to laundry your coin before it goes to SR but they are in vacation mode.I should have waited till tomorrow when they could have filled it. Im so fucking pissed.<br /><br />DONT USE VENDOR GOOD DRUGS,<br />5
