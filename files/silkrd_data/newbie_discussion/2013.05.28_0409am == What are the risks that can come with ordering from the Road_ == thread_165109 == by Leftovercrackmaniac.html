				Best worst case scenario? You don&#039;t get your package, just a slip in the mail telling you they took it because hey, &#039;Murica.<br /><br />Worst worst case scenario?

				IMO, Vendors probably put themselves in the most heat. If you look at the history of how busts and raids occur, they aren&#039;t busting people who are consumers, they go after distributors. If you&#039;re just trying to get a little fucked up you have to consider that the Federal Government has no reason to waste their time on you.

				ladder ops are the only reason LE will bother with small timers. if they have the drop on a distributor, they may attempt to bust some of his/her customers so they can get them to roll over on the distributor in exchange for a &quot;deal&quot;. it&#039;s rare, especially with how careful most SR vendors are. BUT it would suck to be one of those very very few who get railed for a gram or two of your favorite substance. Overall, listen to imoscardotcom. don&#039;t go too big unless you are willing to roll the dice. For example, I personally won&#039;t order more than 3.5g of powder in a single package.

It&#039;s a long debated topic not just on SR, but in the history of CD&#039;s in general. Behind these answers are sound legal arguments and honestly, in my opinion, there&#039;s no right answer. I think a good lawyer can successfully defend a case from either side. I think it helps to know your mailman and your normal delivery time. Mailmen aren&#039;t trained to be undercover cops, so most won&#039;t really hide their tells. If your normal mailman asks you to sign for a package, don&#039;t freak out. Freaking out causes you to make mistakes, act funny, just do crazy things. Just take a quick look at everything. Any cars you don&#039;t recognize? Does the mailman seem off?<br /><br />Put yourself in the mailman&#039;s shoes. He&#039;s been told by the cops he&#039;s making a CD, he has to get you to sign for this, etc. So he knows what&#039;s going on. Don&#039;t you think you&#039;d be acting a little differently? So if you feel like there&#039;s something strange going on, don&#039;t sign. Your gut instinct is usually the correct one.<br /><br />Of course, if it&#039;s not your regular mailman, just don&#039;t sign. How many times have you seen a mailman take a day off?

				It seems as though you&#039;re mainly concerned with giving away your address. If you aren&#039;t worried enough to deter yourself from using SR, but still want to keep worries as low as possible, I would in your scenario attempt to find a vendor that you feel comfortable communicating with, and more importantly I would make sure that this vendor stocks any and every possible substance you may wish to order in the future. This way, assuming nothing goes wrong, you would only ever be giving out your address to one vendor and would be building a relationship with him/her as a customer.

If you go into this thinking things are only black and white, you&#039;re going to get burned by someone at some point, whether it be a vendor or LE. Be prepared for anything, leave nothing to chance. This is why people have flocked to TOR not only for the drugs, but for their general distrust of the state. They are capable of doing anything.

				I recommend asking the vendor if they will waive the signature (if they have to) and if it isnt waived, then you know something is up.

				The risks are as follows..&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Your package could be intercepted/discovered, and you may get arrested. This however, is the absolute worst case scenario. The chances of anyone in the postal service discovering what you&#039;re upto, are minimal at best. Especially if the vendor has decent stealth techniques. Which tbh, all the best vendors do.<br />If you order internationally and customs get hold of your item, a variety of things nay happen. They will more than likey send you a letter of seizure. Also known here as a &quot;love letter&quot;. It will say that &quot;we found your drugs, we&#039;ve seized them, contact us for further info etc.. &quot;, Nothing will happen unless you contest the seizure. In this instance, you should consider this address to be burned. For international orders at least.<br /><br />2. Someone else could find out what you&#039;re upto, and grass you up. This is largely down to you. ie. Keep you mouth shut and don&#039;t tell ANYONE that you&#039;re buying gear online.<br /><br />3. You could get ripped off. Either by way of a bitcoin scam, or by receiving bunk product or no product at all. If you find yourself in a situation where your product doesn&#039;t turn up, or is not what you expected, then SR admin will help you. For them to do so however, you must NOT FE. Not even if the vendor asks for it. Find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require FE. <br />It&#039;s upto you to research the vendors, and find a reputable one.<br /><br /><br /><br />Research is key. Read, read, read. Look up vendor&#039;s review pages, lurk in the forums, and find out as much info as you can, before you order. <br />Also, learn how to use PGP. This is essential. <br /><br />If you&#039;re gonna use your home address, that&#039;s absolutely fine. There is some debate in these forums as to whether you can safely use a false name with your real address, and if you should ever sign for your package.<br />I live in the UK, and from personal experience I can tell you that using a false name here, makes zero difference to whether the package gets delivered or not. But, I would never sign for anything. Not a chance.<br /><br />In summary: <br /><br />Home address is fine for small amounts. <br />Learn how to use PGP.<br />Never FE.<br />Research vendors before buying. <br />Never tell anyone in RL that you buy drugs online. <br /><br /><br />Now, go forth and buy drugs! <br /><br />

				Excellent advice above.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard advice from other friends who use silk road who buy in much larger quantities, and one thing that they point out is that you should try your best to keep a clean house. I&#039;ve failed miserably in this, but if you start buying a lot, you should look into figuring out how to have the place that you order to have no drugs on the premises. Even if you try to argue &quot;I didn&#039;t know they were sending me drugs&quot;, if they search your house and find something else that&#039;s illegal, then you&#039;re fucked no matter how careful you were with your last order.

				You could worry about the risks too much, which could eventually lead to bad times in general, or even a complete psychotic break...<br />Just be smart, take care, and try not to let the risks be too much of a burden.

				I don&#039;t see much difference between signing and not signing for a package, because in botch cases you can&#039;t know what&#039;s inside.<br />Anyone can send you anything.<br />Signing for it doesn&#039;t prove that you&#039;ve ordered it.<br />You might be waiting for a DVD from Amazon and someone who wants to frame you has sent you some drugs.<br /><br />To make the example more obvious, you know the name and address of the local police chief, right? Now what if you decide to &quot;prank&quot; him and send him a little product.<br />He probably gets a lot of other mail anyway, so he will sign for it, not knowing what exactly is that. Does that incriminate him? Don&#039;t think so.<br />Even if they arrest you, I don&#039;t see a way for them to prove that you ordered it, unless you admit it of course.<br /><br /><br />So signing for a package doesn&#039;t seem like much bigger deal to me.<br />Also please note that most vendors do refunds or reships only when the package has tracking.<br />And in order for a package to have tracking, it must be from the ones that require signature to get.

SR is so great for getting things that aren&#039;t generally available locally. I&#039;m still reading and learning and I&#039;m not about to just blindly jump into this thing. Losing a few hundred bucks would suck, but I&#039;m far more concerned about losing my freedom and my future. Is it worth it for a chance to try real opium or high purity methamphetamine? <br /><br />I mean, in theory, even a well established and reputable vendor could be a narc. They could be here to infiltrate the market as completely as possible. Learn the way it works from the inside, establish contact and trust with other suppliers. I doubt the &quot;freedom loving&quot; US government would let the accumulated list of customers go waste either.<br /><br />Even if I received my order in a perfectly smooth transaction, I could see myself losing sleep over that kinda shit for months! Our babysitters/overlords in DC fucking hate this place. They hate BTC. They hate anything they can&#039;t control and will likely do just about anything they can to destroy it...and these days, more and more, they can do whatever the hell they want.<br /><br />
