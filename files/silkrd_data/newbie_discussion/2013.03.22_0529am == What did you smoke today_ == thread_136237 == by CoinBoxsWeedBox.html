				Have you tried Ice Wax? <br />What type of BHO? What was the viscosity? Oil, Wax, Honeycomb, Shatter, Sap?<br /><br />Haha, I&#039;m ever curious. Could talk your ear off about ganja. <br /><br />Let&#039;s make us some defatted / detared BHO. Got hexane and a buchner funnel, whose with me?!? Haha, I&#039;ll dab some up, got a jar.

				I haven&#039;t had Ice Wax. I&#039;d have to ask the dude about specifics, viscosity was like a thicker honey. *My* viscosity was like a much thicker honey, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />Should be seeing the guy in the near future, hopefully will be adding it to the regular rotation of music-making material, along with my trusty butter and MFLB.
