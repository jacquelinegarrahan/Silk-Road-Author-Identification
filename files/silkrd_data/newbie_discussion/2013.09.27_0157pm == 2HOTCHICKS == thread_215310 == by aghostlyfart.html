				Anyone have experience with this vendor? I haven&#039;t had the best luck with communications i&#039;m hoping it&#039;s just because they&#039;ve been swamped. I ordered .5g of MDPV to test them out. The order was marked in transit a few hours after i placed the order so i had high hopes. I also tried their gambling games, which i won at. They responded quickly with a message regarding me being a winner but i have YET to see my funds get transfered, or my package to arrive its now been 10days. I don&#039;t want to diss them especially because i understand i had small orders, but i am not satisfied with the lack of communication or the timely shipping. I&#039;m new to the kamel, so i tried a variety of vendors and substances MOST of the vendors here are great fantastic community but i&#039;m starting to wonder about some of the orders i placed.

				I don&#039;t have experience with that vendor... but right off the bat I sense something suspect.<br /><br />2HOTCHICKS?&nbsp; <br /><br />What women call themselves &quot;chicks&quot;?<br /><br />And they claim to be hot?&nbsp; If they were hot, they&#039;d just be mooching money off guys... not start vending.&nbsp; Like any other hot chicks.<br /><br />:)

				LOL good point yoda, they seemed to be legit had great reviews on their vendor page and what not. I&#039;m finding out the hard way that it&#039;s a much better idea to look up vendors on the forum first as some of them start off legit and then do massive scams and disappear. Really not satisfied with this particular vendor though, because they finally messaged me back and even though they marked it as &quot;in transit&quot; a week ago they messaged me back saying &quot;you didnt get your bitcoin winnings? i thought i sent them i&#039;ll try again, and your package should be arriving soon i JUST got the new order of MDPV, shipping them out today&quot; WTF lol why would you tell your customers that the product has been shipped a week ago you actually ship it? I&#039;ve been impatiently checking the mailboxes for a week now, which i&#039;ve now come to find was for nothing but false hopes haha.

				Yeah thanks ppanth :) that&#039;s really re assuring, although they have about 6more days before i hit resolve. I don&#039;t believe in ruining a vendors rep by posting bad reviews on their page, because i know these guys must be busy as all get out. But in all honesty this is the last time i use their services, and i strongly caution anyone else who chooses to do business with them.
