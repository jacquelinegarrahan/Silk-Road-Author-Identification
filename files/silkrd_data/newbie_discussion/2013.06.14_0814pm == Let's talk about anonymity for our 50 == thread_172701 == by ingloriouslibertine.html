				Long time lurker, first time poster!!&nbsp; Spent a while checking out the site and reading these forums, but held off on registering until I had a clean machine to work with.&nbsp; As I type, I sit behind a fully torrified (all traffic, not just browsers) linux VM workstation which connects to another VM gateway, which connects via NAT to VM with an entirely different OS, which is THEN finally connects to my Host, which is a fresh install of yet another type of OS on a brand new hard drive.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent countless hours getting this setup to work just right, and if anybody on this thread is concerned about anonymity issues I&#039;d be glad to spend some of these first 50 posts helping others make sense of the craziness I just waded through in order to get here.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting started trying to understand the ins and outs of PGP now (and finding a suitable BC site I can purchse w/ cash in my country).&nbsp; <br /><br />We have 50 posts to go, let&#039;s leave some insight for the next wave of neophytes.<br /><br />Cheers all

				In addition to the above, I forgot to mention two other programs I&#039;ve thrown into the setup listed above...for anyone who hasn&#039;t heard of these or similar tools, sandboxie (quasi-VM machine) and truecrypt (incredibly powerful encryption for files, partitions, and whole drives).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Here&#039;s an interesting discussion going on in the security forum about potential dangers opening clearnet sites w/ tor.&nbsp; This is actually the first I&#039;ve heard of this, and it seems to be a bit controversial as to whether or not it is in fact bad practice.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do some digging and post my findings here.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171993.0

				So before I even start, all you sec pros out there can take my explanation of my setup as laymen&#039;s attempt at doing so.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had no formal comp sci education, so this is sort of my understanding of how things I know to be working are actually runnign under the hood.&nbsp; My current setup is a combination of me having built it partially on recommendations from reputable sources (websites, forums, blogs etc) and partially due to my half-assed yet functional knowledge of computer networking that I&#039;ve learned by process of osmosis having spent most of my life as a hapless nerd.&nbsp; So don&#039;t freak the fuck out over me using a wrong term here or there.<br /><br />Each &quot;layer&quot; of protection provided by the gateway and subsequent VM machines it connects through on it&#039;s way &quot;out&quot; of my host PC make it that much harder to ever be able to trace my activity, pretty much regardless of how my machines or connection might be comrpomised.&nbsp; In addition, it makes it nearly impossible to find any physical traces of what I&#039;ve been up to if my lappy were to ever be seized.<br /><br />Honestly though, the main thing I like about using VM&#039;s instead of removable media is persistence.&nbsp; I can install whatever programs I like onto my &quot;main&quot; guest OS, keep bookmarks, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty particular about my software &quot;suite&quot; when using different linux distros, so being able to customize on the fly is pretty much a necessity.&nbsp; Also, it&#039;s just nice to be able to alt+tab out of VM and into other guests, or to my host in between or during sessions.&nbsp; Not having to reboot to switch operating systems is also nice for testing different network configs and the like.<br /><br />My guest VM images sit on different hidden volumes encrypted by Truecrypt and hidden throughout my harddrive.&nbsp; Multiple volumes would have to be cracked to get down to the very &quot;bottom&quot; guest OS that I actually work out of.&nbsp; In addition, some VM&#039;s can be run inside Sandboxie.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only connect to public wifi and throw in a VPN for good measure (and change your VPN provider monthly), and I think that&#039;s about as close to anonymous as you can get.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a list of what I&#039;m currently using.&nbsp; (I think I&#039;ll be switching out the order in which they connect, and probably swapping which OS&#039;s I use where for speed testing and such..so that&#039;d be&nbsp; yet another layer of fuckery that the fucks would have to fuck with in order to fuck my shit)<br /><br />*denotes my preferred programs so far<br /><br />Hiding/encrypting data on host machine<br />----------------------------------------------<br />Truecrypt *<br />BitLocker<br />DiskCryptor<br /><br /><br />VM software<br />----------------------------------------------<br />VirtualBox *<br />VMWare<br />Sandboxie *<br /><br /><br />Linux Distros<br />---------------------------------------------<br />Whonix ****** (by far my favorite)<br />BackTrack/Kali<br />Liberte * (don&#039;t like Live distros but I enjoy using this one)<br />Tails (just in case)<br /><br />Windows OS&#039;s<br />-------------------------------------------<br />Windows 7<br />Windows XP<br /><br />...plus a veritable fuckton of apps and utilities, mostly unique to each different OS I use.&nbsp; I&#039;m all over the place right now, but as I clean it up and make it more efficient, I think I&#039;ll end up with a pretty slick setup (and hopefully a pretty comprehensive guide for new users).

				ok first of all how can we get better software for tor. I&nbsp; need to be able to choose my nodes (which is easily made in the config files) but still I would prefer to be able to do it straight in the GUI. I would also be able to choose a proxy(any kind) before and after my TOR nodes I am passing, which is doable with proxychains, but this would be a great upgrade for a super software. <br /><br />Also I am interested of how I can torify all my connections from my virtualbox which is installed in a windoze 7 system?<br />And how to connect between different VMs inside my system..

				Very nice setup OP and kudos on bringing this subject up however you failed to implement the most important thing in your setup... a hidden spycam! All that security is for nothing if the cops break in when your not home and install a spycam over your pc to steal your passwords! lol... i&#039;m just messing around but I&#039;m kinda not though. If I went through all that like you did I&#039;d put a hidden cam somewhere just as icing on the top :P
