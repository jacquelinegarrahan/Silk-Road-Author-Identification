				Contrary to his name, this vendor is absolutely TERRIBLE at business. His latest reviews are good, so he must be selectively scamming. It took him 3 weeks to finally reply to my message and say he shipped out my order, which didn&#039;t actually arrive. When asked for my tracking he said he didn&#039;t use tracking, which definitely isn&#039;t good for business. I highly doubt he even sent them to be honest. He said he would send with express after i finally brought him to resolution center after a few extensions. All i asked was that he send them with tracking and give me the tracking so I could see and he said he would. But it&#039;s been almost two months now and he is ignoring my messages and hasn&#039;t said anything. I advise you guys to stay away! Especially with nBOME orders which he may not even have.

				If you&#039;re actually going IN to the post office to mail drugs, you&#039;re a fool. If you know what you&#039;re doing, you&#039;re buying prepaid postage which doesn&#039;t get you tracking, but covers your ass. <br /><br />It&#039;s all about safety, folks!<br /><br />Also, fuck scammers.<br />

				Unbelievable. I purchased 100pcs Etizolam Blotter Art (500ug/ each) on 7/22. The next day he apparently lost his PGP key, so I messaged him my address with his new key. He never opened the message, then proceeded to mark it as &quot;in transit&quot; on the 24th. I&#039;m calling bullshit. How does he even know my address if he didn&#039;t look at my message?<br /><br />He hasn&#039;t responded to any of my 3 messages I&#039;ve sent him, and his TorChat is &quot;n/a&quot; so I don&#039;t know what his username is on there.<br /><br />I&#039;ll update this if anything changes, but for now I&#039;m going to assume scam. Tomorrow will be a full week since it shipped. (domestic)

				My order with GAB sat in processing for around five days. The pricing is good, but avoid this vendor. Appears to be selective scamming.
