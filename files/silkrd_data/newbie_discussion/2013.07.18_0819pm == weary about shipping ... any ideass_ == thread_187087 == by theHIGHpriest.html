				new to SR.. about make my first purchase, but its going to be a nice quiantity of some green. I am weary about giving out my real info, in terms of my real name and shipping address. Is there anyone that has done this enough to know if there is a better route on protecting you the buyer? god forbid anything gets intercepted I dont really want it traced to the house (duh)...thanks, THEHIGHPRIEST

				encrypt your address or any other sensitive information.<br /><br />order small maximum 1/4 oz that way if it does get intercepted its not that much of a loss.<br /><br />if your really worried rent a po box<br /><br />always use vendors that has a PGP key.<br /><br />last but not least, relax it probably wont get intercepted if your going with a reputable vendor.<br /><br />enjoy

				All solid advice, except for the false name part.&nbsp; That is asking for trouble in my opinion, unless you can send a few letters to that address under that name and receive just fine, then don&#039;t try it..&nbsp; That is how shit gets sent back.<br /><br />

				Agreed. Time and time again, it&#039;s been recommended NOT to use a false name. That looks suspicious, and is going to cause more time to be spent attending to that letter. The aim is to blend in, and get out of the hands of the postal workers as quickly as possible. There still are MANY routes for plausible deniability even while using your own name. If you&#039;re set on not using your real name, it seems the best option is to set up a P.O. Box with a fake name, but for that you&#039;ll need fake verifiable identification, and likely more than just one; this also brings about a whole host of other laws being broken were that process found out.<br /><br />Also, there&#039;s always having it sent to a trusted friend&#039;s mailing address (ask him first!), and possibly, if he knows the risk involved, paying him a small amount for the service (in cash, obviously). The risk is much lower to both of you as well because the drugs will not be kept at his address, so if LE do investigate, they won&#039;t find anything incriminating (find a friend that doesn&#039;t do illegal things), and there shouldn&#039;t be a trace back to you in that case.<br /><br />But good luck, and welcome to SR! I hope you enjoy this place as much as possible&nbsp; 8)
