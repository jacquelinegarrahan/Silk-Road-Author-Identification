				Being in a big city, while Marijuana is still illegal, the charge for possession of less than an ounce has basically come to a confiscation and a fine.&nbsp; Not enough judges to hear all the court cases, so it rarely goes to court.<br /><br />Just wondering if there are additional complications by receiving a package via the U.S. Postal Service?&nbsp; Does that now make it a federal offense?&nbsp; Just wondering what the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; is in ordering bud off SR.&nbsp; If the charge would just be possession, that&#039;s not a big deal.&nbsp; If it was something a lot worse due to shipping USPS, then I&#039;d like to know.<br /><br />Thanks to all.

				Yes. Receiving drugs in the mail is a federal crime.

				If they can stick a conviction for it there are extra charges for using the mail service. Not sure of the specifics.

				From reading everything I could find on the Shipping forum, it seems the ideal drop setup would be as follows:<br /><br />1. Find a friend in a residential setting (i.e. they have a front porch area where packages could be left) where they have a 100% clean, drug-free house.<br />2. Let them know the deal so that they don&#039;t get freaked out&nbsp; by cops.<br />3. Have packaged delivered to their address and ask them not to sign for any packages.<br />4. If package is left by their door, purchaser could then go pick it up.&nbsp; If not delivered, or if an investigation ensues, simply have friend deny ordering anything.<br /><br />Am I correct that this is the ideal setup?

				The &#039;drop zone&#039; setup that you have come to put together from the forums, - is the ideal one yes. There are ways but with a slightly more risk involved. All depends on quantity, frequency etc.

				Possessing marijuana is different from purchasing/receiving marijuana. Receiving it USPS would be a federal crime, anything banned from shipping is a federal crime because the post office is a federal office. Receiving it through Fed Ex and possibly UPS is not a federal crime as those are not federal agencies, they are private companies. I&#039;m sure there are ways to make a package shipped through a private carrier a federal crime, but I don&#039;t think all banned items are.
