				God no ever see how much pre age in just one term. <br /><br />Obama looks like he aged about 10 years. <br /><br />I used to think about running for public office ( not present ) to really make a difference. But things are so polarized now that it seems futile. Every oneness too busy trying to beat each.

				The modern presidency (that is, after FDR) is a horrible post. You ever notice why presidents age so badly after only 4 or 8 years? Look at Bush or Obama. Jeez those men *worked* like many of us have never worked in our lives. I&#039;d be paranoid about being assassinated. Is it prestigious - yes. Is the income high - yes. But would you want to be stuck working all the time? No time to truly relax. No!<br /><br />To Blurr22: An executive order to legalize drugs would be meaningless. The CSA (as a legislative act) would simply override it. Would it be a big deal if a president did that? Sure, but wouln&#039;t change the law. Maybe he could order the Justice department, DEA, etc. to not enforce the law, which would be under his authority.<br /><br />To Fru-t-loops: Go back to high school gov&#039;t class. The only real authority the VP has is in regards to tied votes and replacing the President if needed. Almost ceremonial.

				Yes.&nbsp; I would set goals (debate and propose solutions to whatever issues) with the congressional folks.&nbsp; To facilitate the process I would hang a Gantt chart on the wall and hold them to it however possible.&nbsp; Ideally congress would be actually passing laws and I would just have to act as executor.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s probably the last thing that will ever happen though.<br />

				No, for a few reasons–<br /><br />The first is that a big chunk of people in this country are bigoted egocentric holier-than-thou-art established-religious cunts that I am vehemently against. If I would be president, I&#039;d want to destroy the nation; yet that&#039;s far too much effort for me and would hurt people who don&#039;t deserve to be hurt.<br /><br />Secondly, I feel that America is a lost cause. Even if I were president I wouldn&#039;t hold much power; the political system is completely run by corporate interests and money. Even if I had power, I&#039;d likely be bought out buy the highest bidder- even the most moral of men couldn&#039;t resist the temptation, or at least not me.

				I don&#039;t want the job, certainly, but I&#039;d take it under one condition: That, starting with me, all officials elected to high office, to include president, V.P., and various other top-tier offices, are to be executed publicly after their term. Call me a martyr, but this would eliminate the career politician, and anyone obsessed with power, which most of our presidents have been in the past 100 years. (In my observation I&#039;ve noticed people with the highest lust for power also have in ingrained fear of death.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably more socially libertarian and economically liberal than Liberal capital &#039;L&#039; though, siding at times with anarchy until practicality comes to mind again :/

				If I were in that position I would use executive power and call for immediate legalization of so called illegal drugs, put legal sales at a certain age, and have inserts with certain drugs telling about possible side effects with some people, and leave it up to people whether or not they want to try or use certain things.&nbsp; Then, I would call for all non-violent drug offenders to be released and those recently arrested to be released.&nbsp; Then I would call for re-opening cases on twin towers and other shit the government lied about and have the real storys come out for everyone.&nbsp; Then I&#039;d fire all government employees who were in on all the public deception from before or maybe have them locked up and see how they like it.(the bastards)
