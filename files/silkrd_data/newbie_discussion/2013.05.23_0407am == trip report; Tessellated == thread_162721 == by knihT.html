				Background;<br />Light pot smoker<br />Done shrooms once before<br />Stimulants here and there<br /><br />Amount taken for first trip;<br />2 hits. Original plan was 3 hits, I wanted to get hit hard for the first trip. In hindsight I&#039;m incredibly glad I took only 2 tabs, decided to drop it down after discussing w/ some people online and realized that the people I spoke to in person have probably never had shit as potent as this.<br /><br />Trip;<br />-Duration: Around 17 hours<br />-Probably, to date, the most powerful experience I&#039;ve had. There was a good 6 hours of intense tripping, and then 11 hours (until I passed out) of still being affected by it. Music, movies, games, I felt so much more connected to it all, in an artistic way. I had a notepad file up the whole time, trying my best to record my experience. Ended up being over 3000 words, my fears, my understanding. A very unique and moving experience. Overall I am incredibly satisfied with how everything went, ordering, shipping, stealth, packaging, and the trip itself. I went into it hoping to come back with understanding of the experience and my own thoughts and feelings, and I got just that. At points I was scared, at points I was having a wonderful time, for 17 hours I had a different perspective on life. Mind boggling to see just how much of an impact two little cotton blotters can have on how you view the world.

				Hiya,<br /><br />Lovely to hear you had a great acid experience (I go back a looong way). But might I suggest that next time don&#039;t even try to keep a record of what&#039;s going on, literally surrender to the void. Bit like txting at a gig, fuck that. Let go! The acid knows what it is doing.<br /><br />Happy trails, look forward to reading about your next experience.<br /><br />Take care.

				Nice to see this thread. I had my first sample of Tess&#039; product recently and I was very impressed. I was planning to post a trip report in the &#039;official&#039; review thread, but I am still working my way to 50 posts. <br /><br />I have been taking LSD for well over 20 years. After everything I had read, I decided to go with just one hit of Tessellated at first. <br /><br />I have never tripped so hard off of one tab. Clean and potent indeed. Tess does not fuck around. I will be back for sure. I think I&#039;ll try two tabs next time :)<br /><br />Thanks, Tess!

Not my first time on acid, but my first time using Tess, and it was one of my top-5 trips. I highly recommend buying from them - it&#039;s worth paying a little more money for a lot more magic.<br /><br />And for anyone who has never tripped before - I&#039;d start with one hit always, and wait an hour to see if you need another. With some (shit) acid you need like 4 hits to get going, but even as a semi experienced user, for me one hit is often enough. Or i&#039;ll take one and another 3-4 hours later just to keep the experience lasting all day :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1

				Tessellated LSD is happy to announce that we are back in stock and our listings are now back up.<br /><br />If they are not yet showing up in the listings you can go directly to them:<br /><br />&nbsp;- 5 hits: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/072149359c<br />&nbsp;- 10 hits: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b26085cd57<br />&nbsp;- 25 hits: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/043c18b207<br /><br />This time we miscalculated how much solvent to use and we ended up with the same LSD on 90% as much paper, this means it should be about 11% stronger.<br /><br />We are selling this extra-kick stuff for the same price as before so if your getting some this is the batch to get it from.

				i ordered from Tess about two months ago, and perhaps it was just a badly laid batch, but it didn&#039;t have me tripping:( i am going to try him/her again, as all the positive reviews clearly show it&#039;s legit stuff. I just think this was an &#039;off&#039; batch or something. i only ordered a few,
