				Does anyone use verified accounts on CampBX? I started filling out the form to email it to them and got worried. You may as well use your real email address because they will have your ID and all your real info and using your tormail would be completely idiotic. Is it even worth it, its obvious not illegal to buy the btc but does campbx keep records of your account and transactions? Seems like the best way, most cost friendly way to get bitcoins at the moment but Im thinking of backing out.<br /><br />

				Agree with Abercrombie. I used them today and fucking loved it. took me less than 15 minutes to take cash to the bank and my coins were in my wallet when i got home. Totally anonymous. I was scared it was too good to be true but i&#039;m happily surprised. <br /><br />Ryno

				Well technically there is the fee since they charge above market. which i don&#039;t mind since it&#039;s anonymous. But it really is crazy easy and simple! I&#039;ll never do it any other way. LOL!<br /><br />Ryno

				Im not a big fan of localbitcoins, theres no sellers selling bitcoins with banks near me, i lied i found one near me and he wanted 145 per bitcoin. Im not sending someone cash in the mail, and that isnt instant anyways. I Signed up for okpay but is said it doesnt serve us customers anymore? I guess i could western union or moneypak someone but they usually tax the hell outta you. <br />&nbsp;I guess thats the price of anonymity...<br /><br />Anyways id like some feedback as to if anyone uses campbx specifically verified accounts or if thats a bad idea for SR.<br />

				I used localbitcoins today for a paypal to BTC transaction for 1 BTC as a test, it took less than 5 minutes total and I didn&#039;t leave my desk. Coinbase is still cheaper but slower
