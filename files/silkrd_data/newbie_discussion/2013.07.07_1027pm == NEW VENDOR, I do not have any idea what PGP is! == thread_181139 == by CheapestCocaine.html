				PGP is just standard unbreakable encryption. You download it, make a profile and a key to access that profile, and then it gives you a public PGP key.<br /><br />Users can then use that public key to encrypt a message that only the person with access to that profile can decrypt and read.<br /><br />This just ensures that if SilkRoad gets compromised, only the individual venders that a buyer dealt with had access to their information.
