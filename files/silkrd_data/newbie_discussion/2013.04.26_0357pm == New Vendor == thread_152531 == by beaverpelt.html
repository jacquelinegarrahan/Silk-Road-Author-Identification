				Howdy Folks<br /><br />I have just signed up as a vendor. Is their a process to get verified so I do not need to get the 50 posts to enable me to start posting in the &#039;marketplace&#039; sub forums ?<br /><br />I also noticed if I put up a listing and save it and then later edit and change the category it does not seem to show up in the category. If I search manually I see it the item and it says it is listed under the category I changed it to,&nbsp; however If i click on the category to browse I can not see it. <br />It works fine when I put up a new listing, but doesn&#039;t if i change it later on. Do I need to allow a few hours for the site to update the category if I edit it ? i.e am I just being impatient ?<br /><br />Many thanks <br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure I know what you mean ? You can search for the vendors name in the search field. <br />I don&#039;t think you can get a list of all the vendors and search like that.. That sounds abit pointless and time consuming if I am understanding correctly hehe

				Well you are not coming up. that&#039;s why I asked , had not tried to search by vendor at time. Double checked&nbsp; put n another vendor name and it came up.. <br /><br />Sometimes I amaze myself :o

				Yeah my vendor name is spelt slightly differently. I&#039;ll post it up when I get back home later. Can&#039;t be stuffed plugging in 3G dongle back in and connecing to SR. <br />SR is so much faster now since the work was done on it over last few days. Working great!! hopefully it stays as fast as it is now. <br /><br />LOL someone -1 me for mt first 2 posts.

				Can someone else please tell me, if am offering a service.. how do I get it to display for everyone if they select &quot;domestic only&quot;<br /><br />if I select from ships from &quot;united states&quot; then everyone who clicks :&quot;domestic only&quot; will never see my ad, Unless they are from USA, even though its a service I provide and I don&#039;t ship anything. Is their a way around this so my ad will show up for everyone with domestic ticked regardless what country they are in ?

				your user name in the forums needs to match your user name as a vendor, I made that mistake so I&#039;m back here posting. Also if it doesn&#039;t match they won&#039;t refund your escrow money you put up to be a vendor or let you into the vendors only group.

				not that it is of use right now, but once back up online, having your listing be listed for everyone, everywhere, you need to go to your settings page (account - settings) there you can set the regions from where to where you ship your products. you need to set your destnation region to worldwide.
