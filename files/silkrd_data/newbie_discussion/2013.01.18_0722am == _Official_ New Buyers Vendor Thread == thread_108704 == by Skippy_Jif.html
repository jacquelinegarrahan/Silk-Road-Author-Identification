				Hello new buyers! Welcome to Silk Road! We are a community that sells many items including drugs. The main objective for this site is to create fully self-marketed tangible/intangible items. Since the site is primarily focused on the drugs section I and other vendors will attempt to steer you towards your first successful transaction and hopefully many more in the future!<br /><br />&nbsp;First, my name is SkippyJif. I have been a Silk Road Vendor/Member for 7+ months. I sell high quality WASHED COCAINE and ENTIRE BLOTTERS at the cheapest on Silk Road. I am very professional with how my operation works and take the necessary steps needed to insure that ALL of my customers(YOU) information is secure. I am relaxed and easy to get along with, but I am very strict about my business! I also like to buy from Silk Road. Being a Vendor on SR is very helpful especially when you&#039;re a buyer. Below I am going to explain helpful guideline to successfully completing purchases and contributing to this GREAT cause we call Silk Road. <br /><br />The first thing you want to do when you have created your buyer&#039;s account is to buy BITCOINS. Bitcoins are a form of fiat money. They&#039;re not physically real just intangible &quot;Money&quot; that allows a person to buy goods/services anonymously. Obviously, this works well with buying drugs.<br /><br />There are plenty of places you can buy bitcoins in public that can be found on the forum. You can transfer money from your bank to a bitcoin vendor or you can buy a MONEYPAK from GREENDOT and buy from a bitcoin vendor on Silk Road. I highly recommend using Sugar Mama for this service. You can easily buy a MONEYPAK from the store, log on to SR and tell Sugar Mama the code and you&#039;ll have BITCOINS in your SR wallet in an hour. Then you can buy drugs!!!<br /><br />Now that you have funds for drugs you have to choose which drugs you want. Since that has complexity written ALL over the subject I will say one thing: Depending on which drug you use will require you to double check the legitimacy of those vendors.<br /><br />When buying from a vendor on Silk Road you want to be sure you read his/her/their profile page! I know we are all going to be enTRANCED by all the drugs that are available that we just want to click the I WANT THIS FUCKING ONE!!! I know that the pictures will reel you guys in and the description will only make you cream your pants, but DON&#039;T forget to read the profile page of that vendor. IT WILL LEARN YOU SOMETHING FOOL!!! Seriously, read the profile page because there are answers to questions typically asked by buyers. We take time for y&#039;all to get a general idea of who we are and what our policies that are enforced. <br /><br />Ok, you&#039;re ready to buy some drugs! Maybe it&#039;s an eighth of JahBUDS Blue Berry or a vial of Hatter&#039;s Cold Shoot heroin. You check their profile out and then look up some other party favors. Maybe you pick up some of SkippyJif&#039;s Pure Washed Cocaine and a Full Print(900 tabs) to go along with your first half order. You click all and add to your cart if the vendor has fully satisfied all you pre-buy needs<br /><br />The next thing you want to do is start your checkout process. Yes, it is just like a fucking Amazon order. Actually, it is much more simpler!!! Pick your shipping option. Next, locate the address box that Silk Road has placed on the order page. You want to add your shipping information to this box. It is completely up to you if you want to encrypt your shipping information with GPG and then paste the info in the box or type said information in plain text. There are plenty of documentations on SR forums that walk buyers through to install/use gpg/pgp programs. Some vendors will not allow you to purchase from them if you can&#039;t encrypt your address so, it&#039;s better to go ahead and learn this very meaningful and EASY bit of technology!<br /><br />Ok, now that you&#039;ve bought the items you may be messaged by the vendors asking to FE or FINALIZE EARLY. FE means that you pay before the product gets shipped. If you&#039;re asked to do this it is because you do not have sufficient buyer stats that satisfy the Vendor&#039;s requirements. This policy will be located on the profile page that I stressed reading earlier. You want to be very careful for who you FE(FINALIZE EARLY) for because it could be the difference between a happy buyer and a very pissed off buyer!<br /><br />In order for you to trust your vendor you have to do research on him/her through the forums and the marketplace from overall reviews. Note that some bad reviews will not reflect whether or not the vendor is trustworthy and has quality product. The point of this site is to buy drugs in a sophisticated way that is interactive to the buyer in a sense they&#039;re receiving the best, cleanest products available to the public on the black market :p&nbsp; That means that YOU determine the quality of the experience you intend to purchase!<br /><br /><br />Alright, now that you have determined that you only bought from a legitimate Vendor you can sit back and wait for a message from the seller. Some times you will receive a message from the Vendor and there are times that you will not receive a message because the Vendor is busy. The real big thing you need to be concerned over is if the product you ordered has been shipped? Go to your order page and and you will see to the right of the item you&#039;ve ordered &quot;In transit&quot; or &quot;Processing&quot; If the item is &quot;In Transit&quot; then your item has been shipped! The Vendor has 17 days to get the item to it&#039;s destination(YOU)!! Usually it takes 2-3 days. If it isn&#039;t shipped then the Vendor still has it and will ship when he/she can!!!! Do not message your Vendor asking when they will ship the order. They have 4 days after which, you can cancel the order.<br /><br />People who have to FE or Finalize Early will see on the order page &quot;RESOLVE&quot; and &quot;FINALIZE&quot; You will click FINALIZE to FINALIZE EARLY when you&#039;re asked to do so and you agree with the Vendor&#039;s terms. You may now wait for your package to come in the mail. This is a very impatient time and FREAKIN FUN!!!!!! Your first transaction with getting your favority, top quality drugs in the mail is nothing less than mind boggling, but you have to be patient!!! The best thing to do is FORGET ABOUT THE ORDER!!<br /><br />I know you&#039;re going to ask the vendor after a few days where your package is if you haven&#039;t received it, but please refrain from doing this unless you and the Vendor have made arrangements to have the pack delivered on a certain date. Be assured that not every situation will be the same, but follow the guidelines and you will be fine. Usually, I wait for 7 days from the vendor marking the item in transit until I message them and ask about the package. Silk Road staff also sends you and the vendor a message that reminds us about the order. Silk Road does a lot of helpful things buyers so, use them wisely because you can make a stressful situation into a high five!<br /><br />Once you receive your package you want to check to see if you received what you paid for. Next check the weight. Quick look over of the quality, basically you&#039;re making sure you got actual drugs. Once you have clarified you have received what you ordered then pay the Vendor. You can rate the vendor later and give a good, fair review of what you thought of the drug, but before you do this you may want to consider contacting the vendor before hand if there are any mishaps, things that didn&#039;t satisfy you to cross check with the vendor if there is something wrong on their end or if it is something that is being caused by you. YOU ALWAYS MEASURE TWICE AND CUT ONCE!!!! Communicate and you will gain more clarity than just being pissed off and throwing out the goods.<br /><br />After leaving positive feedback take some time to reflect on your purchase and enjoy the fruits of your labor!!! Have fun!!! You just completed your first transaction on Silk Road!!! Come on back now ya here!!

By washed do you mean with a solvent, like alcohol or amonia? In other words freebase? Or do you mean you re-extracted with acid.<br /><br />And, entire blotters means that others sell partials? or are you saying full sheets?

But the reality of the situation is buyers don&#039;t always use encryption to conceal their personal information. I always use GPG and ALL buyers should use it too! The big 3 things you need to know when buying is: Use GPG, Read the forum and Don&#039;t Tell Anyone about Silk Road. The less people know the safer you are. Doctor(SR Vendor), Patient(You) Confidentiality Agreement ;)<br /><br />And Newton, washed cocaine is coke with no cut. There are several different washes that remove specific cuts. Message me on the Road and I&#039;ll explain more in depth.<br /><br />SJ

It wont save your ass in the most dire situation. You have to hope that your vendor is as professional as he says he is and retains NO information after confirmation.<br /><br />At the end of the day this is a safer route to your favorite substances but there is still a lot to consider and this guide does pretty well on getting new people started.
