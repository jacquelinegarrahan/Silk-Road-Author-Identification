				So Its been quite a long time since I last had some ecstasy or MDMA, about a year I think? <br /><br />Even though I&#039;ve been going through a lot recently, been away from my friends for a long time actually, so I was quite lonely most of the time.<br /><br />I was absolutely stoked when I found out about silkroad, I heard of it quite some time back but never actually tried it and I did have tor the whole time, so eventually I learned the ropes like every newbie, read through the forums as much as I could, the SR wiki, buyers guide, and basically went through all the sections on SR and was just shocked at&nbsp; how much variety there is, and having no contacts in my area, I can get stuff right to my doorstep!<br /><br />So i&#039;ll skip the rest, I got my bitcoins from localbtc, and went shopping! I had to get some Ecstasy, and since i&#039;ve only had bad pills before (except the first time), because all the pills here are cut with caffeine and amphetamines, I wanted to try some pills from good old Netherlands.<br /><br />Thats when I stumbled upon Schizofreen&#039;s products, I was very tempted to get some MDMA crystals but I had some other orders I wanted to make with limited bitcoins at the time, so I just bought some ecstasy pills. (Mortal Kombats to be precise, 210-220mg MDMA). <br /><br />So after some waiting, It eventually came and was very cleverly packed, and simple! since I only ordered a small amount though.<br />At night I couldnt wait any longer and cut a pill in half, popped the first half and waited 15 mins, then popped the other (I don&#039;t know why I did it but what the hell), 10 minutes later, oh boy did I get slapped in the face! <br /><br />I felt absolutely content, a rush of euphoria came through me and that feeling that you know you just popped ecstasy. I started at 11:pm and played some EDM and dubstep and just danced like a retard in my room, moved with the music, and shaked my head like mad (In South East Asia they call it &quot;goyang kepala&quot; which means shake head in Malay, In certain special clubs, they sell ecstasy and the Chinese people would play some fast ass chinese techno and shake their heads back and fourth like mad, following the beat). <br /><br />I had picked this up since It was what my friends told me how you took ecstasy, when instead dancing would&#039;ve sufficed lol..<br />Anyways after shaking intensely, I looked up and just felt another amazing rushed. Mind me I only took 1 ecstasy pill that night! <br /><br />One other thing is that I smoke cigarettes like a chimney, smoked over 23 cigarettes , I was lucky to have rolling tobacco, but only spliff filters, just hard kind of paper, but the taste didnt affect me, I just shain smoked and rolled the whole night.<br /><br />Heh, I even Messaged Schizofreen to say that the stuff was amazing, and without him I wouldn&#039;t have felt this way (i mean there are other vendors) but his prices were just perfect, and out of the other Vendors I&#039;ve dealt with, he maintained very good communication and assured me that stealth is his expertise! Which was absolutely true. <br /><br />Anyways I started to come down at about 4/4:30am, still had music on, and laid on my bed at 5. heh in all honesty I tried to have a wank after, but for 1 hour pulling dick, it was hard to get my cock hard and even when It was I couldn&#039;t blow my load! I gave up and just slept off at 6.<br /><br />Next day I took vitamins, ate a banana, drank some juice, and the afterglow was just lovely, I was shocked because there was NO actual shit hangover, last time I popped some dirty E pills I woke up with my eyes still massive and feeling like shit. I could actually eat and had a great night!<br /><br />The following night I was a cheeky cunt and popped another one, aware that my serotonin was probably all depleted, and I didn&#039;t have any 5htp to take, but i just had to have another, It was a lighter roll but I had a lovely lovely night, again I still managed to smoke a box of cigarettes and more rolling tobacco... Jeez 40-50 cigarettes in 2 days, I usually smoke 3-5 a day. And last night I even had some DMT while coming down, and unlike the first time where I had a bit of a bad trip, I had an absolutely divine trip only on 25mg of DMT! lovely visuals and colours were just beautiful, alien languages on the wall... I sat on my chair, closed my eyes and looked up, I felt like I was being transported elsewhere and there was a beautiful entity guiding me throughout the galaxies, it held out a heart towards me and I just didn&#039;t know what to do, It was a small trip because I was a bit scared of taking it since the first time was great but it scared me. DMT is definitely a spiritual psychedellic and should be treated with respect, I even made a little prayer to the Tryptamines and asked for a good trip haahah, it all turned out better than expected!<br /><br />&nbsp;But overall today I feel just mellow, just going to eat healthy and will definitely buy again from Schizofreen when I&#039;m ready :)<br /><br />I vouch for his ecstasy pills, not to mention just checking his page his feedback is great! Would love to try his lamborginis! or maybe even get some MDMA crystals. Thank you Schizo for making it possible!<br /><br />Sorry for the long read, I just felt I had to review Schizofreens ecstasy!

Although I have no comment on his processing speed because I have only ordered from him once and that I am located in South East Asia, Although my delivery came on time, It should be fairly fast if you&#039;re in the UK. :)

				Aw jeez blue i&#039;m really sorry to hear that, I guess its very tough to decide which vendor has quality MDMA... And unfortunately I cannot say anything about Schizofreens MDMA crystals since I haven&#039;t bought them, in time I will buy em and test them and let you know but i don&#039;t think that is anytime soon... Try to keep this thread bumped or maybe create your own,<br /><br />I can understand its very frustrating to have your stuff cut like hell... Like I said, maybe make your own thread and some experienced buyers can point you to the right direction :)<br /><br />All the best blue! If not i guess you&#039;d just have to go to each and every vendors page and check the reviews of his MDMA crystals.
