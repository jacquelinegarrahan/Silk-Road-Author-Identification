				Does anybody else use fake names when giving personal details to vendors? Way I see it, if LE somehow does intercept a package, you&#039;ve got deniability if it&#039;s not in your name. Anybody got any opinions on this?

				A fake name arouses more suspicion than a real name. Most vendors state right in their presentation no fake names, or no refunds for fake names, fake addresses etc.<br /><br />General suggestion is to mail at least six letters to the fake name to make sure it actually gets delivered reliably.

				That is one of vendors&#039; biggest pet peevs is using your address but a fake name. You shouldn&#039;t do that, that is one of the main reasons for packages not being delivered or packages being flagged. Whether it is in your name or not as long as you did not sign for it you have the exact same amount of plausible deniability. But putting a fake name just makes it more suspicious looking. Always use real name. If you&#039;re that worried about it then just get it sent to a friends house or find a drop location.

				I have used real and fake names on SR <br />Few things to consider are:<br />Do you live in a smallish community where postie knows names of residents<br />Even with your real name on package if pgp used for address and history/cookies cleared as does when browser closed if settings correct and BTC not traceable <br />Even with a fake name the things in last point will still catch you out name or not <br /><br />I addressed an envelope to my fake name and mailed it from the other side if the city to see if it would be delivered before ordering with it <br />I think you&#039;ll find vendors will offer 0% refund and no reship if a fake name has been used and package goes missing <br /><br />A few things to ponder

				always always always use your real name, alot of vendors wont deal with you anymore if you dont or wont even give you a refund or reship, if you are worried about things arriving you should read about about stealth and procedures than read your desired vendors page and if you have any questions about stealth most vendors have no problem answering whatsoever unless it is clearly spelled out....also if things do go haywire and you gave all the correct info it will most likely show things couldnt be delivered and not for the reason of a bad address or fake name ...more so if things were lost in transit or the other which is the worst but will make a vendor work with you if you have to use resolution cause things are proven....just saying be smart , most vendors do care about customers and take the time to make sure you are safe as well.

				I always use the same fake name. As long as that name is established with the address it&#039;s better to use it because as esoteric69 said, it gives you plausible deniability.<br />The problem is when people decide to just use a fake name every time they order something and the Postal Carrier on that route refuses to deliver the package because he believes that person doesn&#039;t live there. Not all Postal Carriers will do this but some will especially if they have had that route for a long time and knows the people in that town (especially if it is a small town). Then a vendor can&#039;t be responsible for that situation.

				let me put it this way as long as you can receive mail there with no problem whatsoever than yes use a fake one...but i know in some cases the postal guys usually know the people in the area or if the name is that strange or weird they wont send it and most vendors pages say that, ...you do as you please but just make sure that you receive mail there with whatever name you desire to use so you know you should have no issues before you go get uptight with a vendor because something wasnt delivered correctly

				I don&#039;t really see how using a fake name and your real address is going to give any additional deniability. Even if it comes in your name it doesn&#039;t prove you ordered it. And just because it arrives in someone else&#039;s name doesn&#039;t prove you didn&#039;t order it. If they do a CD and then serve a warrant unless the place is clean you&#039;re still going to be in trouble.

				If a parcel gets intercepted and it&#039;s got my name on, I&#039;m going to be busted regardless of where it came from or how I paid for it.

				I&#039;m a newbie, but from a logical point of view, I can&#039;t see how would a fake name help<br />You can pretend you didn&#039;t order a package, but then you&#039;d have to explain how did it get your address on it, aka how would a drug dealer would know your address your begin with<br />You can deny having ordered it, but if someone did send you a package without your knowledge, that&#039;d be to screw you, and then they might as well use your real name as well, so you can still play dumb whether your name is on it or not<br /><br />But that&#039;s just my 2 cent, and I&#039;m just a newbie here

				This thread is why vendors hate newbs haha ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use your real name. If you are that paranoid order it to a friends house. If you put a fake name the chances of it not showing up increase by a whole lot. Then you won&#039;t get your package, then you&#039;ll swear off Silk Road, then you won&#039;t be a part of our wonderful community anymore :( trust me, use your real name, I&#039;ve had a whole bunch of transactions and look at my refund rate ;D

				Glad to hear from a vendor in here in n00bi3 land.<br />I am about a month out from being able to do some business. I spend the time reading here and learning and of course practicing. Already have a drive setup with an encrypted locker. And the drive is nothing but a short piece of metal. Stealthy.
