				You are paying for a product, but on top of that, you are paying invisible transaction fees (DPR&#039;s gotta eat, too! Did you think he was running the site entirely out of the goodness of his heart and a love for all things psychoactive? Don&#039;t answer that...), you are paying for the time that sellers take to securely and discreetly package your goods, you are paying for the secure and discreet packaging... shit adds up. Plus, sellers get scammed, too, and so many have to set their profit margins higher in order to recoup the losses.<br /><br />Basically, what it all boils down to is that you&#039;re paying a premium for the convenience of trading drugs over the internet with the aid of a rather robust rating and escrow system. If you know what you&#039;re doing, you can get to know a random dealer on the Road far better than a random dealer on the street before you make any contact whatsoever. If you don&#039;t think that that&#039;s worth the extra money, then go deal with people face-to-face.

				I understand both sides.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and yes i do agree that some of the prices are nuts for the raw uncut shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;like blow and H.&nbsp; &nbsp;can you believe that some blow is going for $150 a gram!&nbsp; that is nuts!&nbsp; &nbsp;we need a more reasonable price than that.&nbsp; i understand the fees and all that, but you need to understand that these people are not doing this just to get by... they are making serious money!&nbsp; you cant tell me that someone selling blow for $150 a g is not making enough money.<br />I understand that it needs to be a little more than usual but lets not take it out of control!<br /><br />And yes, if you look for a long time, you can find some good deals, but searching on SR takes a veeeeeeeeeeeeery long time.

				Prices are a little high but I have no contacts where I live and want to get off.&nbsp; I want to try some quality H for my first time.&nbsp; I would like some quality coke since I have only gotten shit on the street, same goes with meth, and its just been too long with X so I want some potent MDMA stuff as well.

				Your right they are CRAZY priced.....Because SR hasnt been around long, to let the natural evolution Of the market place occur heres a few tips....<br />USE THE FORUMS....Whatever drug you want, use the SEARCH feature, Pull up about 3 diffrent search tabs, then search for what you want in a couple diffrent ways for example, <br /><br />Best price Heroin<br />Cheapest Heroin<br />best deal Heroin<br /><br />BOOM now open up a couple diffrent tabs on the replys and within 15 minutes youve got some good leads....Go check out the vendors, read there feed back, and when you find a few prices you like, go back to the forums and do a search on them, check there quality, stealth delivery time etc.

				Yes i know it mite be a little hard to understand,&quot;Grammar,structure,etc..&quot;but hey i was on a rant,no need for such things,ya just gotta read it??..Shit,i apologize,i tried reading it and was shocked!.<br />Yes i have read thru for quite some time now,&quot;months anyways&quot;and found the good stuff and prices,but even then its still high even considering what SR gets.Trust me,this used to be quite an income for me,not here but similar type situations.<br />Example...Best coke on here,&quot;which could not be better than what i used to get in late nineties&quot;is over $100 a g!!..If i paid that much a g it would be tha real deal triple washed powder.See if coke is pure enough it will not brick..I have not paid 150 for a g of the best on here,but can almost guarantee its like the old stuff we used to pay extra for yrs ago and even then it wasnt even $100 a g..Yea,these people making a killing,truly are or why take tha risk?<br />Now man if ya cannot get anything at all,like the above poster.Bro,take a vacation to say Houston or New Orleans,walk down main party drag and you can get whatever,except good cid or molly.As far as H,speed and Coke go,man dnt rush into that shit!.If you ever get a good hookup you will wish you never did tha shit!!.A homeboy turned dope boy is no real friend!!..First they share it,its always there,next ya cant mooch,may as well get your own,then its on..Nothing wrong as long as you can put it down,but for those boo boo tha crackhead types,its an illness.Walk with ease into those worlds,things are not what they seem at all!!!..Speed where im at is an epidemic,they used to cook it @ home,now it all comes frm Old Mexico in crystal clear shards,&quot;For those who get it before its cut and sharded up again with acetone..<br />I like this place,but with time i dnt see prices dropping to the other above poster..I see alot of people who didnt watch their P&#039;s and Q&#039;s going down big..If anyone who reads this can remember what was called &quot;Operation Raw Deal&quot;..It was in i believe 08?..People were selling everything you could imagine online through hushmail accounts.Well Hushmail promised protection with an encryption just like this place has...Feds couldnt get into,so they went to a Canadian court and got a warrant..After making buys,&quot;Well over 200 different steroid online dealer types&quot;they started kicking in doors and arresting..At that time you could get on a forum and find the best rated dealer with top notch gear and good to go,&quot;not to mention other things&quot; ..People thought they were safe...This place is alot safer for tha time,i feel safe as i do what i do if i do anything?...I just hate to say,the Gov will take this place one day.Hey prices might drop first?..Just be careful people!.I have seen the ugly side of things and friends go down...
