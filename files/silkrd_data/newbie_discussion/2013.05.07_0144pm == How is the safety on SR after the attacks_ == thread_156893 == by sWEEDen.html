Since it was a DDOS no one really got any information from the site. Just made it slow and unavailable. So there&#039;s no need to worry.<br /><br />And as the previous speaker stated, use PGP and you won&#039;t have to have a worry in the world =)

				Like others have said, use PGP for sensitive information to prevent your info from being read in the event of a compromise on the SR side of things. In terms of the security of the site, I have no reason to believe that anything has been compromised. The attack was a DoS, which doesn&#039;t actually mean code has been jeopardized, and DPRs recent announcements have been signed with his original PGP key. So, unless someone has gotten a hold of DPR&#039;s private key that shouldn&#039;t have it, I think we&#039;re still in good hands.
