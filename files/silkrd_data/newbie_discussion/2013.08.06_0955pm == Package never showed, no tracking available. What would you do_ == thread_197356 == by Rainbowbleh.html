				I&#039;ve already resolved this with the seller.&nbsp; But since he doesn&#039;t have tracking, I have no way of knowing if it&#039;s just lost, confiscated, or what.&nbsp; This is the first time I&#039;ve not received a package.. and I&#039;ve ordered a good amount of packages over the past 6 months or so.&nbsp; I ordered 2 packages from different sellers the same day (I know, probably dumb).&nbsp; One made it, one didn&#039;t.&nbsp; What would you suggest I do?&nbsp; It&#039;s been 10 days since it shipped.. domestic.. priority.&nbsp; So clearly something is wrong.&nbsp; I keep hoping it will just show up randomly so I can quit worrying about it lol.&nbsp; My plan is to use my alternate site and let the main site cool down for a month or 2 at least.&nbsp; See if I get a love letter, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming if cops were going to show up based on this one package, I would know by now.&nbsp; It was a very small order.. definitely personal amount.&nbsp; But I would assume it would be stupid to ship again to the same address anytime soon.&nbsp; Is letting it cool down for a couple of months excessive? Not enough?&nbsp; I know it&#039;s just opinion at this point.. and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been asked a million times.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just bored and looking to up my post count?
