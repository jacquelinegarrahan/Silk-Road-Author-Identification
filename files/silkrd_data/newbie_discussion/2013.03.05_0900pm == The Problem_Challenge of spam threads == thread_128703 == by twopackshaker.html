				If you have gone to a &quot;popular&quot; spam thread, and you intend to spam your way to 50, possibly one of the most annoying things is constantly having to press post until it gets through due to the &quot;reply&quot; warning feature. <br /><br />With that being said, I have decided to start my own thread and get there. Yeah... I am at like 42 or 43 now, I can&#039;t remember. I am too stoned

				In layman&#039;s terms, this is a spam thread. I guess to set some rules for my elite (hopefully temporary) spam club is that a) no numbers are allowed, and b) originality/quality in your spam is encouraged.

				I want a Cheesesteak right now. Very, very badly. Like an authentic one, from South Jersey or ... Philly. I don&#039;t live there anymore, but wow do I miss them. I would buy them in bulk with BitCoins, if they&#039;d come freeze-dried and in stealth. <br /><br />Jeez, only like 4 left after this one... takes forever to go through.

				I am beginning to lose my inspiration for quality spam. I do see your points now, though, after ... my few spam posts so far. I still refuse to use numbers, though. That is cheating... I think.

				Oh, and by the way, if any of you need any help learning PGP encryption/decryption -- I wouldn&#039;t say I am an expert by any means, but I can help you one-on-one if you&#039;d like because I remember, even with all the help in the forums, that shit still made my head hurt. Once you get it, though, it makes total sense. Hollaaaaaa

				I apparently only have two posts left to go. I think now would be the best time to mention, again, that I still want a Cheesesteak. All of you up in the Northeast still have no idea how good you have it.

				Well, in closing, man am I glad that I went ahead and took the time to use my first 50 posts for asking actual Newbie questions the past week or so. But you know what? I think that the problem is once most people get past 50 posts, they (mostly) never come back here again. So the actual experienced members, for the most part I am afraid, are in the other forums. So... anyway, if any Newbies who wind up seeing this have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer any of them that I possibly can. But in the meantime.... uhhhh take care now, bye-bye then Newbie board :) I am off to the land of no spam. I apparently suck at spamming anyway.

				The problem with spam threads is they totally break the noob community and actually make it harder for noobs. I made it to 50 by actively engaging in the noob forum: answering, researching, and asking real questions. The point of restricting people to this forum is so that we can learn from each other and not fill the regular forums with the same question 100 times daily. <br /><br />If you go to any gathering requiring skill / knowledge (say martial arts) they always do this

Most people here (in the Newbie section) are... well, Newbies. To isolate them from more experienced members of the community kind of defeats the purpose, as most people answering peoples questions are also Newbies. There is a high potential for spreading bad information. In our case (you and I both took the opportunity FIRST to learn and ask questions, whereas some people just jump right in to SR and buy, buy, buy -- in some cases not even learning PGP first). I understand the post-count rule is intended to keep spammers from making their way to the other forums, but I mean... hello? Spammers end up getting their first, within like a few hours after joining sometimes I guess. It&#039;s insane.

				Yeah, I think the 50 is just to help battle tons of stupid questions, some that are even on the FAQ, yet I still see those outside the newbie forum...

				Damn... I hope not. My explanation is a) I didn&#039;t know b) I didn&#039;t know c) the &quot;allowed&quot; spam threads are hard to spam in because somebody is always going to reply before you, and prevent your reply to go through right away... all on slow-ass Tor and d) I didn&#039;t know.<br /><br />I see people start spam threads all the time, and I will admit, it started off as me spamming -- but in the least-spamful way I knew how. I don&#039;t think I really said anything very profound, or anything, but it certainly wasn&#039;t meant to be spam. If anyone asks you guys, please tell them it was meant as a work of art or something. <br /><br />Also, I didn&#039;t know.
