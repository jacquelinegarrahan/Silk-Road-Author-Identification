				I was starting to think it was for security purposes but if I leave sr idle for over 60 seconds and i click on a link it makes me sign in again... Paranoia is sinking in and making me think that im using one of those alternate sites but i know im using the right url so... I dunno.. this wasnt happening to me earlier today or before

				This is an issue that is the result of changes made by the admins in order to increase security. Sometimes it gets a little weird like that, though it&#039;s not the cause of any malicious intent (if it&#039;s truly as you describe). <br /><br />When trying to log in if you see a three digit captcha I feel that is indicative of the issue. Typically, I find it happens more often when you have more than one TOR circuit built/multiple sessions up.
