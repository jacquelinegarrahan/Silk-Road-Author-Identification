				Hello and welcome to the silk road. I have yet to find a vendor that I feel comfortable purchasing weed from exclusively. I am seasoned silk road user and have an active presence on the forums. I have over 35 transactions and 25+ BC spent with a perfect 0% auto finalize and 0% refund rate. I always choose to come ont he forums and leave a review regardless if asked or not. If you choose me to sample your product I will leave an unbiased review on your product, shipping and customer service. Thanks! -Jokerman<br /><br />Here are my 5 reviews:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.msg1235458#msg1235458<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161549.msg1215580#msg1215580<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.msg1201360#msg1201360<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=111817.msg1149532#msg1149532<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9715.msg1321782#msg1321782

				Hello,<br />It may be hard to find people that have written reviews since this is the Newbie section. I&#039;ll show you an example of a review that I am GOING to write once I can post in the rumor mill, let me know if you&#039;d like me to review for you even though I don&#039;t fit the criteria:<br /><br />Ordered from Diamorphius (.25g H)<br /><br />Product: 5/5 Weighed out to be .320 mg, probably due to his delay because of spending time in jail. Very appreciated, that&#039;s good customer service right there. Had the normal tar like consistency that somewhat powdered up, but i decided to place it in Distilled water instead. smelled like vinegar. Insufflated .15 mg (No tolerance) and have a very nice buzz going on right now. Very very good value for the low price.<br /><br />Communication: 5/5 Let me know that he was unable to ship on July 5th on the 7th of July, since he had spent time in jail for a traffic violation (outstanding warrant). Was totally fine with it, and he even followed up to let me know it had been shipped in the morning. <br /><br />Shipping: 5/5 I didn&#039;t care that there was the delay, and felt bad that he spent jail time due to his lawyer&#039;s fuck up. He shipped it out Monday morning, it arrived Wednesday morning.<br /><br />Stealth: 4/5 I think there is definitely some room for improvement, both internally and externally. Can&#039;t go in to too much details, but the outside just looked a little off to me.&nbsp; If anyone would like to know specifically, PM me.<br /><br />Overall the experience was great, and I&#039;d definitely recommend him.<br />

				Hi I may have not written reviews yet on the board but that should be all the more reason I should be one of the choosen. Why? This makes my review all the more meaningful to the readers. If I&nbsp; were in your shoes I would definitely look to a variety of people to get the most fair honest analysis. <br /><br />I&#039;m not new to the game by any means and I certainly am not new to S.R by any standard. I&#039;ve sampled many different kinds of bud in my time.<br /><br />Look its simple if your stuff is as good as you say it is it shouldn&#039;t be a problem giving my readers an honest, in depth, simple and concise review for the board.<br /><br />Please consider me for your review thank you. :)<br /><br />

				Of course I can provide that, not a problem. I&#039;ll also include a posting in this thread, a posting in the general domestic marijuana thread, and if you make an official TopShelf420 thread I&#039;d be more than happy to post in that as well. I&#039;m working on the 50 posts right now, and should be there fairly quickly. Heck, I&#039;ll even cover shipping charges if you&#039;d like.

				Greetings and Salutations. I would like to present myself as a worthy candidate to be a recipient of your samples. I have a couple of rather generic product reviews on the SR, and the links to them are posted below.<br /><br />However, those are not indicative of my wordsmithing skills, as they were posted in the spirit of acknowledging a product received and appreciated. To that end, should I be picked as one of the fortunate few, your product would be reviewed with all my talents as a Quality Assurance Manager, with detail as to form, aroma, trimming, does it sparkle(South Park reference), and expanding upon the taste, burn, moisture, physiological and mental qualities imparted after consumption, and closing with my recommendations. <br /><br />Should you choose to avail yourself of my willingness to utilize my talents in service of reviewing your product, you will not be disappointed. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f9b3c1a971/60<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/56fbb19eb8<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/34bb11e9d0/10<br /><br />I have others purchases in transit, that I will be reviewing upon receipt and ingestion of products.<br /><br />Thank you for your consideration of me as a reviewer, in advance.

				Yes I am able to do that on the board np<br /><br />Sample:<br />Well from first glance the shipping was stealth the packaging appeared first rate 5/5. Vendor shipped very quickly and sample arrived fast(won&#039;t mark down for usps delays not your fault). Upon first inspection of the bag it appeared to have a very potent but very familiar smell we&nbsp; all know as fire from our past experience.<br /><br />The bud was very dense with no stems great quality 5/5. I delicately packed the bowl and took my first 3 hits. The effects were instant but also I noticed a sensation creeping up more and more in my mind as my mind began to catch up.&nbsp; Feeling it going further and further off in the distance of stonier land the body buzz was unmistakable at this point(25 mins in). It just felt good all over my arms and my legs from head to toe. My senses all began to dull but in some way it felt like I was in perfect harmony and peace with an overall feeling of unmistakable mental clarity. It feels like a pleasant dream. This is some good shit 5/5.<br /><br />Bottom Line: For the price and quality from this Vendor you can&#039;t go wrong!<br /><br />Hope this helps this is one of my experiences I texted my friend not to long ago describing my experience high.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure want someone who will give a good review but I&#039;m also sure you also want someone who isn&#039;t going to automatically give u the highest that&#039;s me that my job it means so much more to earn that high score that glowing review than than to have it just given wouldn&#039;t you agree?

				1.5 hrs soaring upper body head chest third eye expansion… 3+ hr medicine not for beginners-Shoot, i know some who cannot smoke it because the are thrown onto the couch from over medicating-it is a one hit sort of strain and two for avg users and 3 for those needing heavy effects-i could see losing time and taking a nap if using too much and anxiety for those not used to such strong medicine-can be very introspective even emotional reactions-not a stealth strain but not as bad as others-does give one the munchies :^) a almost perfect balance between sativa /indica effects would love to have Medibles from this strain. <br /><br />is this what your looking for in your reviews?

My trip was not very visual but very euphoric and gigly. It felt like I had a wider range of view - like I could see across the whole apartment. My friend was staring at a painting for over twenty minutes saying that everytime he breathed it changed colors from red to white. At one point I was sitting on the floor looking at the carpet and it seemed like the individual strands of carpet were moving slightly in a wavy pattern. Lights were very bright. We tried writing on a notepad but our writing was terrible and it didnt make much sense. One of the girls that was tripping kept talking about leaving and coming back to reality. We tried to play N64 mario kart and it took us over an hour just to set up the game to play. The trip seemed to move in distinct stages. When we were writing on the note pad we were able to write down some phrases that we said or thought that seemed very important at the time:<br />&quot;Play reality man&quot;<br />&quot;Why does it feel like water losts of water&quot;<br />&quot;NO PHONES&quot;<br />&quot;No swimming we,&quot;<br />&quot;This IS Drugs&quot;<br />&quot;stay inside&quot;<br />&quot;loops&quot;<br />&quot;Im in reality, im here in and this is goodality&quot;<br />&quot;WHY.

				My sample came in today!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Shipping Speed (5/5)<br /><br />Two days in transit.&nbsp; What more can I say?&nbsp; This got to me a little faster than I was expecting.<br /><br />Stealth (5/5)<br /><br />Professional exterior packaging with printed labels and a return address. MBB used and interesting additional barrier.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen that used before.&nbsp; No smell at all before the MBB was cut into.<br /><br />Product (5/5)<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag, my face was hit with a lovely lemony, pungent, piney, fuel-like scent.&nbsp; It smells amazing.&nbsp; The first bud I picked out of the bag was a perfectly shaped half gram (exactly .500 on my mg scale lol thought that was kinda neat), trimmed tight and covered in crystals.&nbsp; Definitely medical quality bud.&nbsp; I was given 1.3g as a sample, thanks for the extra!&nbsp; Nice full, light green calyxes that crush apart beautifully, against small burnt orange hairs.&nbsp; Lemon, pine and fuel dominate the pallate as well, becoming most prevalent on the exhale.&nbsp; Definitely an OG variety.&nbsp; Some lung expansion and desire to cough, but that isn&#039;t a bad thing.&nbsp; Burns down to a nice white ash.&nbsp; This was flushed and cured nicely.<br /><br />The high is powerful and it hit very quickly.&nbsp; This is great night time bud for sure, totally relaxing with a bit of couch lock stone.&nbsp; It hit quickly and hasn&#039;t let up yet after an hour so it seems to be a pretty long lasting high.&nbsp; Only took a few hits as well.&nbsp; This is potent.<br /><br />Overall (5/5)<br /><br />topshelf420 has some really great nugs.&nbsp; This is definitely among some of the better nugs I&#039;ve seen from the road and in life.&nbsp; They got to me extremely fast, and an overweight sack.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t know what more I can say.&nbsp; topshelf420 is a great vendor.&nbsp; I&#039;m really impressed.<br /><br />Thanks for letting me review this sample for you!&nbsp; Really great service.&nbsp; You won&#039;t have any problems here.

				Some of the best bud I have ever seen. Pure frosty white and fresh. Great smell with a hint of lemon. Definitely not a strain for anxiety!<br />Communication 10/5 - Very Friendly and Fast to respond to messages and forum posts.<br />Shipping 5/5&nbsp; - Good&nbsp; stealth idea and inside moisture barrier and anti-static bag.<br />Potency 10/5 - Damn - do NOT underestimate this bud<br />A few hits had me gone for the rest of the night!<br />I had pictures but I was honestly so high that I lost the pictures I had of the surface of the bud with all of its trichombes :(.<br />Definitely give this bud a try for anything you need except for any mental issues.. this bud is not for the weak hearted or anxious!<br /><br />Thank you for the opportunity to review this bud. This vendor has high potential&nbsp; ;D.<br />Amazing<br />Edit: The pictures he has on his listings are extremely accurate

				Hey everyone, we are sorry to announce that the FREE SAMPLES we reserved for SR are now out of stock.&nbsp; We have shipped the last of our samples out to all qualified reviewers today, if you&#039;re still interested you can still try a sample but it will no longer be free, you can order a sample by visiting the URL below.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1f15aad464<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Honestly, just read our reviews so far and get at least 4G (URL to 4G listing, please visit our vendor profile), it&#039;s more bang for the buck.&nbsp; If you take 1 hit of the White Fire Larry OG, you&#039;re going to automatically want to get reup with AT LEAST 4Gs after your first hit anyway =), this is actually coming from picky growers that have smoked hundreds of different strands.&nbsp; So do the math, it&#039;s a NO BRAINER!

				THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR REVIEWERS so far, if you haven&#039;t posted in our official review thread yet, please do so.&nbsp; But regardless of where you posted your reviews, we just wanted to say THANK YOU for trying our White Fire Larry OG.&nbsp; We are happy that our product and services allowed all of you to write such great reviews, (well lets be honest some were better than others, but who&#039;s counting?).&nbsp; In the end, we&#039;re all happy and that to us we believe is what should really count.&nbsp; THANKS AGAIN!
