				Hey roaders.<br /><br />Just saw a bunch of listings put up by a new vendor named Gandoff white, who is apparently selling 4 FUCKING OZ of different types of greenhouse bud for $400, and 1 pound for $1200-$1500. That is 75% lower than what someone should be asking, these listings reeks of scam or LE.<br /><br />I could be wrong about this, and if I am I sincerely apologize, but there is no way someone would sell these strains for this much. Look around, you can&#039;t get 4oz of fucking shake for $400.<br /><br />DONT EVER FE! DONT EVER FE! DONT EVER FE!<br /><br />If you order and after 3 weeks your shipment mysteriously gets &#039;lost in the mail,&#039; and you end up getting refunded $100 of your $400 or $400 of your $1500, or LE shows up with their German shepherds, don&#039;t be surprised.<br /><br />Also, their profile asks you to use privnote if not using pgp, everyone on here should know that privnote is not safe and hasn&#039;t been for awhile. The smell of bullshit thickens.<br /><br />If you fall for this, I feel sorry that you will lose your money (or end up in cuffs), but if you believe that prices like these can be real, you deserve to get your money taken.

Stay cautious, buy from reputable vendors.<br /><br />Additionally, stay clear of privnote. Any vendor advocating privnote is not taking their customers security seriously. Never place an order without PGP. I believe I read an analogy about it yesterday along the lines of &quot;if you knew someone had a gun, would you wear a bulletproof vest or take the risk?&quot;. Use PGP, don&#039;t take the risk.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf
