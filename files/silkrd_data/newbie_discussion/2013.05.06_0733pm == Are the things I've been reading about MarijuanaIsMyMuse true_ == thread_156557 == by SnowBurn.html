				I&#039;ve been reading the forums quite a bit and there&#039;s been various accusations that MiMM is a selective scammer. If this is true how can his feedback still be so high? Also does anyone know why he/she is currently in stealth mode?

				Well, I don&#039;t know if he&#039;s a selective scammer or not, but I&#039;ve personally never had any issues with him. The first purchase I ever made on SR was with him and I had no issues, and at the time I had also read comments on the forums accusing him of being a selective scammer. I&#039;ve done business with him since then, and still no issues.<br /><br />He has a huge business going on right now, so I don&#039;t think he should have a reason to selectively scam anyone.<br /><br />And as to why he&#039;s in stealth mode - it could be because he&#039;s backed up with orders and messages right now due to SR being down for a while, so he needs time to get shit sorted out. Or perhaps people are trying to drop his stats (I&#039;ve seen it drop from 96 to 93, now at 94) so he only wants to deal with loyal customers. Some of this could be true, or it could all be wrong; I have no idea, these are just my thoughts

				Let me start by saying I do not know MiMM nor have I ever ordered from him. I will say that it is common for a vendor to become very large and eventually not be able to keep up with the amount of business they are doing. When that happens, orders are often missed or mixed up leading to people to believe they are a selective scammer, etc. I am not saying this is the case with any certainty at all but it is definitely something to keep in mind.

If he was scamming he would probably be asking for FE. BTW there is a guy on BMR impersonating bcpltd and HE IS STEALING from people, ripped me off. bcpltd has posted on SR that the guy uses his public key to trick people and I think he called him &quot;A LYING PRICK&quot;, sounds like he might know who it is :)

				I haven&#039;t done any business with him for a couple of months and the reason being shit product/batch of Meth..

				My experience with him would suggest he&#039;s not a scammer (or a very sly one).&nbsp; Made an order that didn&#039;t arrive and was given a 50% refund.&nbsp; Later found<br />delivery may have been compromised at my end so contacted him offering to return the refund as it may have been my fuck-up, he replied not to worry about <br />it and simply use him again sometime. Not what you&#039;d generally expect from a scammer.

				I got an ounce of his hi-heat stuff recently.. I ordered 2oz, they sat in processing for ages so I cancelled 1oz when the option came up. He sent the second one eventually, it arrived pretty stealthy and was top notch stuff.<br />Wouldn&#039;t buy off him again though, don&#039;t think he&#039;s a scammer but it was a fuck around to buy anything off him...<br />Maybe he&#039;s stealthy to sort his shit out...

				I bought some of his hash a month or two ago. The picture and description was beautiful blonde lightly pressed hash that looked amazing. I was so excited when I got my package until I opened it&nbsp; :P<br /><br />He send me low grade dark garbage hash that I cant even bring myself to smoke. After I complained to him he changed the picture on all his hash listings to the actual hash. I asked him if there was a mix up and his product was not a advertized. He played dumb with me for a couple messages. I didn&#039;t even care it was $70. I&#039;ll never buy anything from him again. I would not recommend this vendor based from my one experience.

				Hey guys! GP here .. Just want to clear up any mixups! I am NOT MiMM we have worked together for awhile! He Did weed I did everything else. SR was down a bunch so started a site on BMR just in case as we have a lot of money invested. I dunno how to put it but to put all the BS to bed MiMM is a name you guys recognize more than GoingPostal .. and understood! We are MiMM just the boys in the back handling shit! If orders are late or delayed then u can blame MiMM as we wait everyday in our warehouse to move orders once processed! If it is late .. then Blame MiMM! If delivered in a timely fashion with great stealth .. Thank GoingPostal/MiMM lol. We have a large! Large volume of orders. We also have a new few people in place for responding to messages which I know is important! There were unreplied (by 2 weeks) messages before we stepped into this side of it .. we used to just wait for encrypted orders fill and ship .. not anymore! We are glad we are now more pro-active and such. If u ever feel like i scammed u PM me and we can discuss it. We ship every order we get! We don&#039;t scam .. and if your order get&#039;s lost we find it and set it .. THIS IS THE NEW MIMM 2.0! Here to help! Here to supply and here to break trail for the new age of &quot;getting your shit!&quot; :)

				LOL he just threatened me to change my feedback to 5/5 or he will be putting me on scammer list....<br /><br />Look at his page...here is some of his latest feedback: <br /><br /><br />1. FE. Shipment has not arrived after being marked in transit 9 days ago.<br />2. Product didn&#039;t arrive. Excellent communication however, and acceptable resolution. Good vendor.<br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 orders did not make it to OZ and by reading other comments never will. Was refunded one order but dont know if the first order will be because i FE. So if from Aus would not both<br />4. product never arrived, he would not respond to any messages or resolutions<br />had to wait weeks for SR to refund<br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;didnt arrive to Germany. got refund. <br />6. Didn&#039;t get it, got refund with extra<br />7. Order didn&#039;t arrive (high risk country) MIMM was very helpful with refund. I Highly recommend MIMM and when shit calms down here i will try again.<br /><br /><br />You selective scammer, thought you could scare me from changing my 1/5 like you did to all these buyers. Please...I am not an idiot MiMMs. Nice try, you scamming cunt. <br />

				From my experience, MiMM has been a great vendor. <br />I don’t think you should believe a lot of the hating you’ve read about MiMM.&nbsp; I think we’ve all run into some shady characters traveling down the road we’ve chosen, maybe some of these people are paranoid, some truly feel they’re entitled to something they are not and some have acted a little shady themselves and not been successful….and they probably do screw up sometimes but&nbsp; I don’t think they’re trying to scam anyone. Shit happens. They deal with it.<br />I&#039;ve been doing small but steady business with them for almost a year now and a few weeks ago was the First time I&#039;ve had a problem with the product quality (or any kind of problem). I contacted them, they answered quickly, asked Me how they could make it right, I said what I thought was fair, they agreed and that was that. <br />No denials. No haggling. Absolutely No Bullshit.&nbsp; They’ve been awesome.<br />I expect to receive agreed upon compensation sometime this week and I can get back to you all on how that went down but my experience with these guys has been nothing but positive.<br />The counts are good, the product is lovely.&nbsp; <br />Sometimes the delivery takes longer than I would hope for but they Did post when they were making some pretty major changes to their organization and to expect some delays.<br />

				I&#039;ll chuck in my 2bitcent...<br /><br />Early on many many months ago I started my journey on the Road and in my initial searches of the glorious offerings, the vendor that appeared repeatedly throughtout my screenshopping was MIMM. The man has a WalMart style drugstore ffs. The allure of every potion or poison a traveller could ask for sold by the same vendor. And all wit NO FE (Before he changed his mind). So being fresh to processes of SR, also being a broke ass newbie, took the plunge with a measley order. It wasnt til after I placed the order, as has been the trend in my purchasing history unfortunately, people started to exclaim orders not turning up and MiMM&#039;s integrity being questioned. A month passes by, after resolution extended 14 days, and nothing. Yet with a few more purchases under the ol&#039; belt, a few domestic, and about two International&#039;s arriving within two weeks of their respective order dates. So it ain&#039;t turning up is the verdict and the obligatory 50% refund without question. No problems I thought in my unknowing naivety. He probably sent it and the border toughness argument justified its disappearance. Months pass by and a short look into MiMM&#039;s transaction history only reinforces my experience<br /><br />His feedback IMHO should be a lottttt lower than what it currently is, 5/5 for No shows and 50% refund feedback, one after the other for pages and pages. Either he has somehow captured the newbs market and those that prefer amicable resolutions than being truthful in the face of being taken advantage of. <br /><br />Consider this scenario, MiMM gets an order, from a new user ( -5transactions), International postage address and a relatively small sized order. What would you think is most profitable way to do business? How would you as a vendor trading on a 150 order per day volume deal with this situation? <br />a) Send order as a good vendor should, <br />b) Mark &#039;In transit&#039; with dispatch and wait 30 days to refund 50% of order or c) Send item with inevitable loss of package and refund 50% of costs.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m not saying I know whether or not MiMM &#039;selectively scams&#039;, but the fact that a vendor has an overwhelming amount of lost packages, and contiues to be able to supply and maintain a page that continues to trade an even expand onto other markets as well a fkn warehouse smells, tastes,&nbsp; sounds, feels and fucks like bullsh!t. It may have only been one personal purchase from me and one in every 50 purchases would point to me being the problem, but a strike rate of 35 out of 50 purchases with non receipt cannot be LE getting good, Customs cracking down or even a coincidence. 25 purchases &amp; 75BTC worth later, and only 5 no shows. <br /><br />Personally if I were a vendor and had a strike rate that low I&#039;d be in pretty big trouble...

				Well, I guess I spoke too soon.<br />After we came to a resolution and I was fairly certain I would receive a fair deal from MIMM, it never happened<br />When I inquired about it, they ignored me a couple of times and then they asked me for a order number for the re-ship, I told them they didn&#039;t give me one and then I got a message back basically saying, &quot;What, you didn&#039;t receive something? Not sure what you mean, go to the resolution center Mate&quot;...which they should have known damn well I couldn&#039;t because I didn&#039;t have a new order # from them...<br />SO, not sure if it was an honest mistake or if I got screwed over but I do know I&#039;ve lost that lovin feeling for MIMM.<br />Too bad really<br />

				I am unsure if I was scammed by MIMM or not. Here is my situation.<br /><br />I received tracking 2 days after my package was delivered.&nbsp; When I checked the mail that same day,&nbsp; &nbsp;there was no package.<br /><br />I was offered 50% refund which seemed unfair to me.&nbsp; (I bought when 1BC was worth 250)<br />So he said a reship was in order.&nbsp; He said reship was sent.&nbsp; After 2 weeks of waiting I rated him a 1/5 due to poor communication and potential selective scamming.<br />He then asks me to change my rating from a 1/5 despite me not receiving anything.&nbsp; I change my rate to a 3/5 with a honest description of our transaction as I dont know if I was scammed or not.<br />It has been 3 months of re ship communication but it feels like he is duping me.<br /><br />Here are some problems I have with MIMM<br /><br />Hes asking me if I received a 50% refund.... Wouldn&#039;t he know this?<br />Asking me how many transactions I have had with MIMM. Wouldn&#039;t he know this?<br />Telling me he reshipped product. Then telling me his reship tab was &quot;overlooked&quot;. (So it wasnt shipped?)<br />I also asked 3 times how many packages had been sent out and lost with my address.&nbsp; HE WOULDNT FUCKING ANSWER ME.&nbsp; How can they be so unconcerned with my potentially personal information? This is all insane imo.<br /><br />I cannot say if this vendor scammed me or not.&nbsp; But I am sure dealing with these people is a waste of time, as they are not organized or trustworthy.<br /><br />Use caution when ordering.&nbsp; Do not FE.<br /><br />One question I have for the members here is.<br /><br />How long can I change my rating for vendors?&nbsp; Say I changed my rating from 1/5 to 3/5.&nbsp; Will I be able edit my rating forever? or is there a time limit?&nbsp; Because I FE I feel like MIMM is trying to trick me into giving him a higher rating than he deserves. <br /><br />

				MIMM is fucking me.<br /><br />Its probably against the rules to post our SR messages but he has been wasting my time for 3 months trying to get a refund.<br /><br />DO NOT ORDER FROM MIMM.&nbsp; Theyre scamming whether they know it or not.

				Dunno, folks; it IS important that we expose scammers but my first two orders from SR--and they were within the last month--were both with MiMM: I wasn&#039;t asked to FE even though I didn&#039;t have any previous purchasing record and when I recently e-mailed him/her about a question I had, the response was quick and courteous.&nbsp; <br /><br />Both the coke and the MMDA were of decent quality. I&#039;m sorry to hear others have had far less satisfying experiences but if MiMM is a (selective) scammer, I would have been an ideal candidate.<br /><br />Best wishes to all.<br />

				I ordered from Marijuana is My Muse for one of my few first orders outside of weed. He had some green calvin kleins. It was pretty good quality and fantastic stealth.

				I just got a package from him a few days ago. <br /><br />Order was shipped from CA and arrived in USA east coast in about 4 days. Super fast shipping. <br />I only ordered 0.5 gram of MDMA. It arrived and was overweight. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if he only scams on larger orders or what. I&#039;m hopeful to continue doing business with this Vendor.&nbsp;

				I think my experiences with this seller might be appropriate to this thread....<br /><br />I am in a medium to high risk country. I accept things do get seized, stolen, or go MIA<br />I have over 2 years on SR, almost 250 transactions, approx 20k spent, 96% Success Rate<br />also I was loosely involved in similar things back in the bbs days, just not for drugs or BTC<br /><br /><br />My first 2 maybe 3 orders from MIMM arrived and in reasonably good timeframe.<br />Quality was good enough to have me coming back, so let&#039;s call it:<br />3 delivered from 3 ordered<br /><br />The next order went missing, no biggie (50% refund after 30 days) so we&#039;re<br />3 from 4<br /><br />Another successful order<br />4 from 5<br /><br />Then another failure (with refund)<br />4 deliveries from 6 orders, or 33% failure rate now, but in the 90&#039;s elsewhere<br /><br />Some time passes, quite a few vendors coming and going, so<br />I place two larger orders with mimm, and BOTH with TRACKING <br />Also used a VIRGIN address for one and a previously 100% address for the other<br />They BOTH get intercepted, confirmed by tracking info at both ends<br />can&#039;t blame MIMM for those&nbsp; &nbsp;[1]&nbsp; and again 50% refund, But now i&#039;m at<br />4 deliveries from 8 orders<br /><br />some time goes by, i have fresh receiving details<br />place a small order and it arrives quickly, woohoo<br />5 from 9<br /><br />so i immediately place THREE identical small orders, two to VIRGIN addresses<br />none of these three arrive, 50% refund again but it&#039;s at<br />5 deliveries from 12 now<br />&nbsp;<br />MIMM continues the no fuss 50% refund policy, but I was still in the 95% range with other sellers so just stopped using MIMM. I noticed the goingpostal account, whatever that was for, but didn&#039;t pay much attention, as I was having 90% + success with other vendors<br /><br />Months later i see goingpostal has earned good stats on another market,&nbsp; so dumbass that i am, i place a small order...of course i never saw it, just the friendly offer of 50% refund... The first few times they offered 50% I just put in another order with them, more fool me! The vendor continues to hold high ratings, so must be doing something right, but with multiple accounts, names and addresses used, we get...<br /><br />5 deliveries from 13 orders?<br /><br />I have not used this vendor in a long time now. The funny thing is they&#039;d have made more money long term by keeping me happy in the first place!<br /><br /><br /><br />[1]&nbsp; &nbsp;I am NOT in any way suggesting MIMM is doing, has <br />done, or ever would do anything untoward, but pointing <br />out a weakness in the system right &#039;there&#039;
