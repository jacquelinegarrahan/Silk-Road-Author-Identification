				Hey guys. recently I&#039;ve come into contact with 500mg of 99.8% pure DMT. I am no stranger to this drug, and have tried it about 3 or 4 times before. However, everytime I smoke it, I seem to do it wrong. The first time that I did it, my friend brought home about .2 of yellowish DMT from a music festival. From what I understand now, DMT that isn&#039;t white, isn&#039;t completely pure, but i didnt know that at the time. Anyway, we packed a hit in a bong, with a layer of weed underneath so it wouldn&#039;t fall through. My friend took a hit first, demonstrating the proper way to smoke it: by holding the lighter up to the powder just enough to get the DMT to melt, without touching it. After my friend took a hit, he was GONE. He was rolling around on the couch, giggling&nbsp; and saying stuff like &quot;oh my god&quot; and &quot;holy shit&quot; for a good 5 or 6 minutes before coming out of his trance. When it was my turn, I did the exact same thing with a fresh it of DMT. The only thing that happened to me was I got a real weird body high and that was it. We still had a tiny bit left after that, so my friend let me have the last scraps, because it didn&#039;t work for me the last time. This time, i tried putting it on a bowl, with a layer of weed on the botttom. Again, a smoked it the way i was told to smoke it, and nothing really happened. Anyway, fast forward to a few hours later, my friend had left, and my roomate had just come home from work. We briefly spoke about my DMT experience ( my roomate isn&#039;t that much of a psychadelic user, so he didn&#039;t really understand what DMT was.) After that we decided to smoke a bowl. I grabbed a bowl ( the same one I had smoked the remainder of the DMT with), and noticing that there was a bit of weed scraps left in the bowl, I decided to take one more hit before I packed a fresh one. I held the lighter right up to the bud and took a big hit. I tripped absolute BALLS from this. When i took the first hit out of the bowl a few hours before, the DMT must have just melted into the weed or something. This is weird, because i smoked it the wrong way this time, and there was way less DMT in the bowl than there had been in the bong. This is the only time I&#039;ve really got DMT to really work for me. All the other times, I&#039;ve had to smoke a whole lot of it to get a decent high, and every time I&#039;ve smoked with a friend (even first timers) they always seem to trip sack from it, where as I only get the strange body high. I don&#039;t want to waste this crazy 99% pure shit, so i&#039;m hoping I could get some advice from some experienced spirit realm travelers. I also purchased one of PriscillaMarie&#039;s DMT/Meth glass vaporizer pipes to go along with the DMT. I&#039;ve attempted to smoke about 100mgs of the stuff so far, once out of a bowl, and once out of the DMT pipe. I failed both times. I am a little confused on how to use the glass vaporizer thing. I put the DMT through the round hole on the spherical end of the pipe, and then held the lighter just below the glass. The DMT instantly bubbled and turned to liquid mist, and I got a decent sized hit i think. Am I just supposed to breathe through the mouth hole while I light this stuff? If I do, it looks like it&#039;s possible that some of the vapors will escape through\ the spherical hole on the end of the pipe, but If i cover the hole with my thumb while i light it, there will be no air flow, and i might burn my thumb. Sorry for the long post, but I hope that it gives you guys enough information to help me out

				the best way to smoke DMT is out of a meth pipe. vaporize it and inhale deeply. you get the most bang for your buck this way. you can buy one off silk road for less than a bitcoin under the DMT section. It&#039;s what I did and works like a charm. You can also do the deal with tinfoil but I don&#039;t find it as efficient.

				A trusted friend just informed me of the &quot;Volcano technique&quot; after I told him I was having trouble breaking through on Roger Petes DMT, I haven&#039;t done the research on this method yet but I will do the research and post what I find about it.&nbsp; Everyone raves about RP&#039;s Deems, so I&#039;m sure that this novice just doesn&#039;t know how to smoke that shit right.&nbsp; Body buzz is all I get.&nbsp; So if you search the forums try the &quot;volcano method&quot;.&nbsp; My buddy said he tried it with the RP deems and said and I quote &quot;I just did some of RPs DMT and it sent me to the mmmmoooooooonnn.....MAN&quot; So yea I gotta get that shit back out for another go.....he also said that if done correctly we shouldn&#039;t taste the nasty burnt plastic taste from smoked tryptamines that I associate with DMT and 5-MeO DMT, so if vaped correctly there should be little or no negative taste...Much to learn for this DMT noob.&nbsp; &nbsp;Relic on

With DMT you dont think you got a decent size hit ... you KNOW when you do - everything physical disappears and you get that sound .... you&#039;ll know the one. <br /><br />NEVER mix it with weed. NEVER mix it with tobacco. Mix it with Changa (smoking mix made of selected complementary herbs). Or smoke it straight through a glass pipe as others have said. <br /><br />Another way is to use a pipe with a gauze over the top. Here you can either mix the DMT with herbs (Changa smoking mix) or just have it straight. Its better with the herbs i reckon. If you are desperate for herbs use tea leaves (not ideal but it will do). What the herbs do is give the DMT a bit of a base to burn on, rather than just vaporising without you being able to inhale it.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />Interested to know what you think when you work it out ;)

				Do you hold your thumb over the hole at the end of the glass pipe while your vaporizing the DMT, and then inhale when the pipe fills with smoke? Or do you leave your fingers off the hole while you light and just inhale the whole time?

				Get yerself a GVG aka Glass Vapor Genie, kiddos. Easiest way to breakthrough imo<br /><br />Alternatively, sandwich it INBETWEEN layers of some inert plant material (I don&#039;t recommend weed, it fucks with the effects and makes it harder to integrate the experience IMO) and gently pull the smoke without burning the DMT...it can be hard to perfect this but works well if you can get it down right.

				Ah&nbsp; something I can answer!<br />I used to make DMT from plant material about 12 years ago.<br />Initially it was clear, then turned opaque white then yellow then brown over a period of months.<br />It always smoked the same ... which is DYNAMITE.<br />It only takes a rice grain sized bit to get you going.<br /><br />Stay away from a bong!<br />I tried a crack pipe which was OK but I found the best was just a small test and a straw.<br />Stick the straw in the tube just above the DMT and heat underneath the glass.<br />Note the glass must be heat proof.<br />A TT is ideal as it has low thermal mass (ie gets hot fast)<br />Suck in the vapours as it heats up. No burning involved.<br />It will hit you in about 5 seconds and you will know it because the world will cease to exist ...<br /><br />I never got this thing about it being hard to smoke ...

				Try to do a sandwich method with either herbs or ash. You take a hit, hold it for a good 20 seconds, and then take another one if you can. This should do the job...

				I saw a video the other day on youtube where this guy created a kind of ghetto vaporizer out of a big plastic bottle and tinfoil.&nbsp; He used the cap as a kind of mould for the tinfoil to make the bowl, cut off the bottom of the bottle and put it over the tinfoil, then pulled the tinfoil up and flattened it against the side of the bottle so he could kind of insert and remove the bottle from this tinfoil cup-container-bowl thing.

				Like Punko says smoking DMT in joint is DINAMY.TE<br />Be careful to sit down somewhere comfortable&nbsp; when you smoke it&nbsp; because it can be violent and you can fall .<br />I Smoked only once but I look forward to make ABUSE of DTM...<br />
