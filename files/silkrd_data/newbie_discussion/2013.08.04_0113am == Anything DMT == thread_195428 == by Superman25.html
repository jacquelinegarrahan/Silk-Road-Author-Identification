				I had been doing self-research and experimentation for roughly 15 years at this time in my life with psychedelic chemicals and concoctions. But I had only recently heard of Dimitri&#039;s unbelievable power and utter existence for that matter. Maybe only 2 years prior. Being informed the best I could for a substance of such intense potential, I decided that if I was chosen by Dimitri, then she would find me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in my life I had been addicted to opiates of all different colors and varieties, had been smoking weed for all but about 2 and a half years of my life since i was 12, because I was in the US Army. I joined because of a meth problem I developed around 20, but was not using anymore. I had plenty of experience with mescaline cacti, 25i (sold to me as LSD), DOx (also sold to me as LSD and wow), I had even grown my first couple indoor weed harvests and psilocybe cubensis flushes. I was smoking weed and cigarettes every day, as well as a small maintenance dose of methadone to prevent withdrawal from the opiate addiction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had recently began going back out into society and experiencing the world again since my 4 year opiate problem began. I had several old friends from my past resurface. I was also going through a break up with a girl that I really didn&#039;t want to be with anyways. Still disappointed with myself for my addiction and where I was at in my life, I knew that things were going to get better but I was still weary of the world and confused to say the least. Not sure how tripping with these kinds of life events works for most people, but I wanted to make a dramatic change with lasting results in my life.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there I was sitting at home when the phone rang, it was the universe telling me that Dimitri wanted to introduce herself to me. My buddy D had acquired some orange, waxy small crystals and powder in a small ziplock baggie. It smelled like new shoes, or new rubber or something. He knew I was into psychedelics so he got a bunch when the opportunity showed itself. We decided to wait until the next evening so I could take a day to prepare myself for the mighty substance.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day I took my usual dose of 20 mg methadone in the morning around 10am. I smoked all day as usual, maybe a joint an hour plus a cigarette. Then I lounged around all day until I decided to go hang out with my buddy J. I told him about my plans and he decided to join. He knew a little about DMT but not much. We waited until we got the call from D to come over. I was so excited I could only eat a small piece of a sandwich all day. When we got to D&#039;d house he showed us a couple pages from Rick Strassman&#039;s &quot;The Spirit Molecule&quot; that he thought we should hear again before the journey. He selected some intense dubstep/electronica/trippy music to play during blast off, and told us one more time what to expect, how to react to the sensations safely, and basically wished us luck and happy times. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loaded up the bowl with what he thought was an appropriate dose, I&#039;d say it was somewhere around 100 mg give or take. We used his glass weed pipe with a big fat bowl of weed. I&#039;ve since then dramatically altered my DMT smoking ritual as that is a tough way to effectively utilize all the DMT for me personally. I nervously hesitated for a good 30 minutes before I built up enough courage to take a hit, asking questions and preparing myself mentally. I got myself comfortable in the den with some blankets and pillows, turned the lights in that room off so the only light was leaking in from the living room and a few candles placed nicely through the room. I sat down on my nest by the warm cozy fireplace, nodded to J and D and smiled. It was time!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a big, fat, looooong hit like Terence McKenna instructs, and held it in as long as possible. Maybe 30-45 seconds. The harsh smoke tasted like burnt plastic and smelled like death. We tried to vaporize as best as possible. I let it out and took another hit. This time we put a little more flame on it. Before I even let it out it hit me like BAM! I remembered Terence and wanted to &quot;Take the third toke!&quot; But I was too overwhelmed by the sheer intensity. I told D, who held the pipe and lighter for me, &quot;Let me enjoy this bro, I&#039;m good for now&quot; and I laid back and closed my eyes before the visual vibrations tore the whole world into a million pieces. I heard J say to D, &quot;Wow, I&#039;ve never seen anything do this to him!&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D, I think it was D, put some headphones with the music he selected into my ears while i laid on the floor on my nest. When he did that all the visuals and even the warm body sensations started &quot;dancing to the music&quot;. I felt like I was physically moving at a high rate of speed up, away from earth. With my eyes closed it looked like I was moving through an underground tunnel with hieroglyphics and geometric patterns snaking around the walls, of all different colors imaginable. In the middle was the always changing, morphing, dancing, singing, multicolor, multishape, merry go round that I can only say must have been the chrysanthemum that McKenna describes. I was noticing how beautiful it all was when I noticed, no I &quot;sensed&quot;, never &quot;saw&quot;, a tall, gray, robot-alien-ant-lady standing behind me watching me as I laid there experiencing this.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I had a chance to communicate with her, she let me know she was DMT. She was alive. Then she thrust me beyond light speed into another &quot;place&quot;. One of my earphones fell out but I was too scared/astonished to even think about trying to fix it or even care. I could hear my friends talking and joking about something so I just started explaining what I was seeing so they could remind me later in case I would forget due to intensity of experience and the nature of DMT. The new &quot;place&quot; I was trying to explain to them with mere human words could do it no justice whatsoever, but i carried on. My spirit or center of consciousness was basically floating in a desert with 3 upside down pyramids floating on their points in front of me, each pyramid barely to the left of the one in front of it. Each block or stone that made these pyramids had a symbol of some kind inscribed onto it like a hieroglyphic. Some that I&#039;ve seen on pictures of the pyramid writings, some on playing cards like spades and clubs, even some astrology symbols like mars and venus. Each stone was also moving toward the side of the pyramid, following the stone in front of it in snake like patterns, until it reached the side of the pyramid, then it would slide onto the next row and go the other way. Until it reached the top of the pyramid, then it moved to the bottom of the pyramid behind it. Confusing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After maybe 20 minutes or 230 years, not sure, I opened my eyes and asked how long it had been. Only maybe 5 minutes! NO WAY! Everything still looked insanely beautiful, bright, and shiny. There were even shapes and jewels floating around the room and hanging in a grid about 3 feet down dangling off the ceiling. I was amazed at everything about this experience. I didn&#039;t know what to say except, &quot;I only have human words, that&#039;s not enough...&quot; My buddy J was a very nervous after he saw how intense it was for me. I told him that he couldn&#039;t live his whole life and not experience that when it called out to us! Indeed, he agreed to proceed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never forget the first time I smoked DMT. It showed me that you never know what life has in store for you next. It was such an intense experience it changed my outlook on myself and my invincibility. It destroyed me in a matter of seconds, a feat i didn&#039;t believe existed previously. I have taken many spiritual journeys since then and will take many more, but I will always respect the awesome power and keep my mind open to the teachings that these miraculous discoveries have for me. Safe Tripping and be careful! :)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Fractalbliss, a new vendor, has some pharmahuasca (DMT-Fumarate) that it claimed to last 4 hours. He sells 120mg and 150mg capsules with 200mg harmaline capsules. You take the MAOI (harmaline) then 30 minutes later the DMT. Sounds a little more intense than just smoking it. It is suppose to be similar to the native shamanic preparation, ayahuasca.

				Also, MAOI isn&#039;t good with foods containing considerable amounts of tyramine include meats that are potentially spoiled or pickled, aged, smoked, fermented, or marinated (some fish, poultry, and beef); most pork (except cured ham); chocolate; alcoholic beverages; and fermented foods, such as most cheeses (except ricotta, cottage, cream and Neufchâtel cheeses), sour cream, yogurt, shrimp paste, soy sauce, soybean condiments, teriyaki sauce, tofu, tempeh, miso soup, sauerkraut, broad (fava) beans, green bean pods, Italian flat (Romano) beans, snow peas, avocados, bananas, pineapple, eggplants, figs, red plums, raspberries, peanuts, Brazil nuts, coconuts, processed meat, yeast, and an array of cacti.<br /><br />MAOIs + tyramine = hypertension = possible heart attack, so avoid the above foods for atleast 24 hours prior to ingestion.

				I will copy paste my trip report where I have been discussing my DMT approach in this thread.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.0<br /><br />I had a strange night this night involving some emotional anxieties and problems, lsd and dmt.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I can call this breaking through, but honestly I don&#039;t care any more. I was not off in another universe or experienced any kind of trip reports that I have read. All these reports that describe being in places or ego deaths are beyond me and I can&#039;t reach them until now.<br /><br />Anyway, long story into short. I realized these days that I am in a really bad psychological position. The last month was a total disaster but I kind of didn&#039;t see it or tried to hide it by persuading myself that I am ok. Dmt came then into my life and I am sure I become obsessed with it and all my thoughts were there. My mind have played some really ugly games the last 2 weeks. I can&#039;t breakthrough, I don’t have the need to be out and meeting new people which is one of my weaknesses and most important of all&nbsp; I have found myself two times not able to perform sexually (today was the second one) just because my mind fucked me up with silly thoughts. This particular fact had me destroyed. I was always considering myself a sex god until before 1 months where I had my last girl.<br />Today this wonderful new girl I have meet last 2 weeks, that I have started to feel something, comes and we take my last 2 LSD tabs. Again after 1-2 hours and while the effects of lsd has started I got stressed! First time that I am high on lsd and I can’t focus on the beauty of everything. Fuck, I feel shit to say this but I couldn&#039;t even get a steady hornyness (up,down,up,down) and just kept kissing and etc,etc. I never had something sexual while on lsd but from what others say it is an experience really strong because as you know your senses while on lsd are on a very high level. I was touching&nbsp; her and kissing her very smooth but I wasn’t there. I was alone with my negative thoughts and again saying to myself how fucked my mind state is. Fortunately (I don’t believe I actually say this) she had her period so she stopped me saying &quot;damn it would be perfect if we had sex on lsd but I can&#039;t so stop&quot;. We haven&#039;t done it by the way until now.<br />Anyway, I don&#039;t know why I write all these again. Sorry!<br />So another friend comes and we just relax all night at my place. The lsd trip was really different from all before. I just couldn&#039;t feel happy and had constant thoughts about how fucked I have become all of the sudden the last month. My friend, I just realized then, that I have stopped to love and appreciate myself. I always tell myself that I am the best but the last month I wasn’t believing it. 5 hours later I am finally alone. I know this is time for me to try and think about my current messed mental state. I decided to go out at the sunrise and go into a forest that I have found nearby with my bicycle. Need some fresh air and some positive energy to escape this mental prison I am in. I am on lsd anyway and there is a chance that I will feel better if I just go and let my mind free in the deep forest. I stayed in the forest about 2 hours. Going all over the forest “playing” with all the nature, the sounds, the little animal. I just embraced life again. All went good. Not quite peaceful, but it was a necessary thing to go out and just let myself in the arms of nature. God how strong nature can be!<br /><br />I went back home and decided to try the combination that many talk about and vapor some DMT while tripping on lsd. (It wasn’t at the peak as it was 6 hours before I took it, but still having the positive energy that you have while on LSD).<br />&nbsp;I load 40mg on my machine and take it all with 2 tokes.<br />I can&#039;t really remember all the details and it is very very hard to describe it in words. But will try anyway since I have already typed some much bullshit <br /><br />I said to myself and to the &quot;dmt&quot; &lt;&lt;Okey I believe I am ready&gt;&gt;.&nbsp; An female&nbsp; entity I have seen the last 2 times is again there. This time the scenery is colorful and a bit stronger. It&#039;s center has some kind of algorithms and symbols that I try to understand. I am there, in my room with my eyes closed and having hallucinations. I know am there and once again I know I am not going to breakthrough. The colorful entity is also there with me and this time I felted something really strange and new. &quot;She&quot; was waiting me and kept me company. She wanted me to see into my problems, my troubles. She was just singing in a strange language and was staring at me as if she wanted from me to do something.All of the sudden one by one, all of&nbsp; my&nbsp; negative thoughts, problems and emotions came up. I was feeling like going really deep in my soul. Every problem was in a existing material form in the sense that I could not only feel them but also see them (I can&#039;t describe it better right now but I was looking to my feelings and thougts as if they were small circles). I was erasing and destroying every one of it. She was there, looking at me fighting with my mind.&nbsp; She was there finally happy and not scary or disappointed from me. As this kept going for a long time I felt more and more released, more free again and built again my self respect and mental welfare. This particular point of the trip was really strong. I was seeing for the first time myself.&nbsp; She was there and told me every time not to care about such silly problems. All those algorithms around her were exploding into huge lights everytime I managed to look delete consciously my negative thoughts that has been so deeply rooted inside me without even knowing there was such a deep part of me or even that there was a mulfaction there.&nbsp; She was kind of singing to me that&nbsp; it is me that it is important, not my problems. It is me myself who make these mental obstacles and it is again myself who is in charge of overcoming them and not fall under them.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t breakthrough one would say because the way I see it breaking through is on a state where you look like taking a nap. I know my body was there with me because I can recall my body. The trip ended after 10-15 minutes and I find myself with tears in my eyes and just giving kisses to her while saying dozens of times thank you and thank you.<br /><br />This was really deep my friends. Nothing I have ever experienced before. Going into and seeing into my inner soul and deleting all those problems from the core of myself, while having &quot;her&quot; next to me was a fantastic experience! I don&#039;t know if this was the combo with the &quot;leftovers&quot; of lsd and honestly I don&#039;t care about breaking through. This was what I needed at this point of my life and will stop with daily use of dmt for now. I have the respect of it I had before starting being obsessed with this so called breaking through. I am sure it is an amazing experience but I can&#039;t find anything right now that can be more amazing than finding myself again. Maybe an ego death as you all good people say will help, but for now I don&#039;t feel I need it. I feel really alive and happy again.<br />I really loved my today trip. I wasn&#039;t just seeing stuff, I learned something from it today. And I guess that is what all experienced users are talking about. It is not just visuals, it is a way to go inside your own ego and find pieces that you never knew you had. Maybe lsd was the key, maybe not, maybe the vibes from the forest, maybe not those as well. In any case, dmt today helped me a lot!<br /><br />Have a nice day my dear friends<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Adamiz

				The one time I did DMT was around a campfire listening to schpongle with my exgf (gf at the time) and some acquaintances.. not the best set and setting because I wasn&#039;t completely comfortable with them and the music was just too much. The way the light from the campfire was bouncing around made me feel like I was in a scary circus and just freaked me the fuck out.. needless to say I&#039;m looking forward to a proper experience next time in the way I most prefer to do psychedelics- in the comfort of my own home with my choice of music playing.

I was not off in another universe or experienced any kind of trip reports that I have read. All these reports that describe being in places or ego deaths are beyond me and I can&#039;t reach them until now.<br /><br />Anyway, long story into short. I realized these days that I am in a really bad psychological position. The last month was a total disaster but I kind of didn&#039;t see it or tried to hide it by persuading myself that I am ok. Dmt came then into my life and I am sure I become obsessed with it and all my thoughts were there. My mind have played some really ugly games the last 2 weeks. I can&#039;t breakthrough, I don’t have the need to be out and meeting new people which is one of my weaknesses and most important of all&nbsp; I have found myself two times not able to perform sexually (today was the second one) just because my mind fucked me up with silly thoughts. This particular fact had me destroyed. I was always considering myself a sex god until before 1 months where I had my last girl.<br />Today this wonderful new girl I have meet last 2 weeks, that I have started to feel something, comes and we take my last 2 LSD tabs. Again after 1-2 hours and while the effects of lsd has started I got stressed! First time that I am high on lsd and I can’t focus on the beauty of everything. Fuck, I feel shit to say this but I couldn&#039;t even get a steady hornyness (up,down,up,down) and just kept kissing and etc,etc. I never had something sexual while on lsd but from what others say it is an experience really strong because as you know your senses while on lsd are on a very high level. I was touching&nbsp; her and kissing her very smooth but I wasn’t there. I was alone with my negative thoughts and again saying to myself how fucked my mind state is. Fortunately (I don’t believe I actually say this) she had her period so she stopped me saying &quot;damn it would be perfect if we had sex on lsd but I can&#039;t so stop&quot;. We haven&#039;t done it by the way until now.<br />Anyway, I don&#039;t know why I write all these again. Sorry!<br />So another friend comes and we just relax all night at my place. The lsd trip was really different from all before. I just couldn&#039;t feel happy and had constant thoughts about how fucked I have become all of the sudden the last month. My friend, I just realized then, that I have stopped to love and appreciate myself. I always tell myself that I am the best but the last month I wasn’t believing it. 5 hours later I am finally alone. I know this is time for me to try and think about my current messed mental state. I decided to go out at the sunrise and go into a forest that I have found nearby with my bicycle. Need some fresh air and some positive energy to escape this mental prison I am in. I am on lsd anyway and there is a chance that I will feel better if I just go and let my mind free in the deep forest. I stayed in the forest about 2 hours. Going all over the forest “playing” with all the nature, the sounds, the little animal. I just embraced life again. All went good. Not quite peaceful, but it was a necessary thing to go out and just let myself in the arms of nature. God how strong nature can be!<br /><br />I went back home and decided to try the combination that many talk about and vapor some DMT while tripping on lsd. (It wasn’t at the peak as it was 6 hours before I took it, but still having the positive energy that you have while on LSD).<br />&nbsp;I load 40mg on my machine and take it all with 2 tokes.<br />I can&#039;t really remember all the details and it is very very hard to describe it in words. But will try anyway since I have already typed some much bullshit <br /><br />I said to myself and to the &quot;dmt&quot; &lt;&lt;Okey I believe I am ready&gt;&gt;.&nbsp; An female&nbsp; entity I have seen the last 2 times is again there. This time the scenery is colorful and a bit stronger. It&#039;s center has some kind of algorithms and symbols that I try to understand. I am there, in my room with my eyes closed and having hallucinations. I know am there and once again I know I am not going to breakthrough. The colorful entity is also there with me and this time I felted something really strange and new. &quot;She&quot; was waiting me and kept me company. She wanted me to see into my problems, my troubles. She was just singing in a strange language and was staring at me as if she wanted from me to do something.All of the sudden one by one, all of&nbsp; my&nbsp; negative thoughts, problems and emotions came up. I was feeling like going really deep in my soul. Every problem was in a existing material form in the sense that I could not only feel them but also see them (I can&#039;t describe it better right now but I was looking to my feelings and thougts as if they were small circles). I was erasing and destroying every one of it. She was there, looking at me fighting with my mind.&nbsp; She was there finally happy and not scary or disappointed from me. As this kept going for a long time I felt more and more released, more free again and built again my self respect and mental welfare. This particular point of the trip was really strong. I was seeing for the first time myself.&nbsp; She was there and told me every time not to care about such silly problems. All those algorithms around her were exploding into huge lights everytime I managed to look delete consciously my negative thoughts that has been so deeply rooted inside me without even knowing there was such a deep part of me or even that there was a mulfaction there.&nbsp; She was kind of singing to me that&nbsp; it is me that it is important, not my problems. It is me myself who make these mental obstacles and it is again myself who is in charge of overcoming them and not fall under them.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t breakthrough one would say because the way I see it breaking through is on a state where you look like taking a nap. I know my body was there with me because I can recall my body. The trip ended after 10-15 minutes and I find myself with tears in my eyes and just giving kisses to her while saying dozens of times thank you and thank you.<br /><br />This was really deep my friends. Nothing I have ever experienced before. Going into and seeing into my inner soul and deleting all those problems from the core of myself, while having &quot;her&quot; next to me was a fantastic experience! I don&#039;t know if this was the combo with the &quot;leftovers&quot; of lsd and honestly I don&#039;t care about breaking through. This was what I needed at this point of my life and will stop with daily use of dmt for now. I have the respect of it I had before starting being obsessed with this so called breaking through. I am sure it is an amazing experience but I can&#039;t find anything right now that can be more amazing than finding myself again. Maybe an ego death as you all good people say will help, but for now I don&#039;t feel I need it. I feel really alive and happy again.<br />I really loved my today trip. I wasn&#039;t just seeing stuff, I learned something from it today. And I guess that is what all experienced users are talking about. It is not just visuals, it is a way to go inside your own ego and find pieces that you never knew you had. Maybe lsd was the key, maybe not, maybe the vibes from the forest, maybe not those as well. In any case, dmt today helped me a lot!<br /><br />Have a nice day my dear friends<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Adamiz<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can count that as a breakthrough I think in terms of how DMT can be healing. In time the experience will deepen. Shattering through the issues of self and ego and sometimes delivering a sound ass kicking if we abuse it. You may want to explore yoga and meditation as a means of priming yourself for DMT if you are seeking it as a true spiritual medicine.<br /><br />Here is my last trip which changed everything about me. Quite literally everything. It was the most scary, beautiful and enlightening experience I have ever had.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=128241.1080

				Recently, I purchased 4 doses of freebase DMT, and had a couple of questions. I talked to the vendor, and he was very helpful, but I wanted your opinion. <br /><br />1) How do you guys smoke DMT? I currently don&#039;t have access to an oil burner(meth pipe), and was thinking about using the lightbulb method? But I also read that putting down herb, then DMT, then more herb works just as well with an average dose (50mg)?<br /><br />2) The vendor told me 50mg is enough to break through, is this legit? I&#039;ve done a little research but can&#039;t seem to find a definite answer.<br /><br />Thanks!

I burned almost all of the dmt. Some users use this method but it is extremely difficult to master. The lightbulp is pretty much the same. If you have the financial ability buy a Glass Vapor Genie.(GVG). All the experienced DMT user suggest this. I haven&#039;t got myself one of this yet.&nbsp; Also really good for vaporize weed if you use as well. The cheapest and easiest way to vapor your dmt is to use the &quot;Machine&quot; method. All you need is a small glass bottle (50-100ml) and some metal brillo (the one you use to clean dishes). Info about building these can be found in the clearnet:<br />https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=25974.<br />Although I wouldn&#039;t suggest you using a straw. As for herb, I don&#039;t know. It is a matter of taste I guess. I vapor my DMT without any other herb.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195428.msg1426214#msg1426214">Quote from: nosajorolok on August 08, 2013, 08:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2) The vendor told me 50mg is enough to break through, is this legit?

Although if you master your technique you can break through with only 20mg. Many users have this amount for breaking through. A detail I have learned through these forums is that anything of too much is not good when it comes to DMT.<br /><br />Hope this helps. <br /><br />Adamiz<br />

				I&#039;ve never tried it myself but have heard McKenna give countless talks and explanations on the effects of DMT.<br /><br />I think fear is the only thing keeping me from actually trying it. How difficult is it to break through and why do most people have such a tough time doing it?

				I have been able to breakthrough several times with Deemz on top of weed that I took 1-2 hits off of already as to lessen the harshness from a green hit vs a bowl with 2 tokes already taken off. Since then I&#039;ve started using a meth pipe. Yes it takes some getting used to if you don&#039;t know how to use one, but as long as you vaporize for 2 seconds or so, then give the glass 2 seconds or so of no heat, then more flame, then break...etc...all while you&#039;re rolling the pipe between your fingers then it should vape just right. It requires more flame if it&#039;s jungle spice, less if it&#039;s white or yellow DMT. Just get it smoking with the flame just underneath it about a quarter inch or so. It also takes about twice as long to initially get the DMT to start smoking as it does to keep it going once you&#039;re already smoking and rolling the pipe to evenly distribute the heat and not just boil it all at once. I hope this was helpful and not just completely confusing. The point is to take as large of a hit or 3 or 5 or whatever you can manage and hold them in for a loooong time! At least 20 seconds minimum, then IMMEDIATELY take another in the exact same method, then another...&nbsp; until your pre determined dose has been vaporized. The reason most people don&#039;t break through every time is probably a variety of reasons from inefficient smoking techniques to not holding it in long enough because of the intensity of experience to the simple fact that a level 5 breakthrough psychedelic experience is not possible every time you have an experience. Most people NEVER experience that in their entire lives! So if you do even experience it only once, feel fortunate that you will always have that, you were allowed into there world!
