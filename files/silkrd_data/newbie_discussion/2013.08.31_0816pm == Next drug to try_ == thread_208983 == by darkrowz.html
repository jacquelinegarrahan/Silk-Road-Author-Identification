				Having only ever smoked weed, I was wondering what drug would be cool to try next. I&#039;d love for someone to give some suggestions or personal experiences.

				Are you interested in psychedelics? I recommend some LSD, some suggest that you should start with mushrooms and get a feel for the psychedelic experience but there is no written rule to what you should start with.

				LSD is great, and blotters are the safest thing to get in the mail. If you&#039;re never don psychedelics before I would advice you to start with a small dose though, and increase weekly (or however often you trip) until you get where you want.

				It&#039;s really all up to your preference, or what you&#039;re looking to get out of altered states.&nbsp; I personally recommend psilocybin, hashish, MDMA or MDA, and MXE.&nbsp; Bear in mind that all those are compounds that should be taken with more caution than cannabis warrants.&nbsp; I&#039;d also like to throw in that I personally recommend staying away from opiates, benzodiazepines, and stimluants.&nbsp; I can honestly say that I&#039;ve never seen anybody being better off as a result of those types of drugs.

				LSD is great but it&#039;s really throwing yourself in at the deep end for your first psychedelic experience. There&#039;s no shame in starting out with 2C-B or another short-lasting psychedelic for your first time.<br /><br />My other suggestion is MDMA. I think everyone should try MDMA and a psychedelic at least once in their lives.
