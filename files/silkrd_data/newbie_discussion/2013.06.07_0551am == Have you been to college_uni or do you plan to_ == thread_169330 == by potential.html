				I have, but I think I could have learned the same amount of information with some books and willpower. Maybe it was motivation via GPA and gamified learning that I was paying premium for. A personal coach or tutor would have been cheaper. However, I do appreciate the diploma, and my soft skills did improve enormously. How about you?

				All the information that you need for a college course is able to be self taught. All a college degree is a piece of paper that you can show to your employers that shows you can do the job. Currently studying Mechanical Engineering.

				But you need that paper in order to get a job!<br /><br />I liked college, you learn a lot of life experiences.&nbsp; Im studying Biomedical Engineering!&nbsp; Yet I still trip and roll face at festivals.&nbsp; Gotta love life!

				Yes. If you do something you like, it is very interesting.<br />If you don&#039;t, it is shit.<br /><br />Most of uni/colleges just teach how to earn money. Also mine does. That sucks at all.

				been there just finished...i loved the experience of Uni found it way to easy and boring at times especially with all the BS classes for the first year or so but learned some valuable business finance while i was there. Now I dabble with the stock market and can easily analyze any company which is a ridiculously tedious time consuming thing to do but it really works. Just made 10 fold on a $1000 in penny stocks so you could say these loans are paying themselves!!

				I went to college for three years before i realized i&#039;ve been hustled harder than i have ever been in my entire life. If what you want to do for the rest of you life requires that you get a degree, for example being a docter, then go to college. If your going to college to get a good job, and make good money your being hustled. <br /><br />I&#039;ve spent 3 years working on an electrical engineering degree only to realize if i became an engineer i would hate my life. I&#039;ve always wanted to do philosophy but never saw the point in racking up a 30 grand debt for such a degree. If college has taught me anything it&#039;s do what you love, and money is not important.
