				ÃŒt seems fairly priced and as a good vendor, but i am really scared of getting an RC(espessially with the reports of bitter taste),&nbsp; i am a bit of a hard head combined with i like to do quite a strong dose when i drop, and i really dont feel like i want to die because i get rc..<br /><br />So has anyone did over 10 of these at a time ?

				I haven&#039;t heard much about GG&#039;s tabs either. I would say cough up the dough and go for Tessellated&#039;s tabs. From what I hear they are the best way to go right now. I have some on the way and am psyched about it. I put in the order last night and they are already marked in transit. You might also consider lucydrop, but you&#039;ll want to wait to see how this whole reship/orders not showing up goes. Supposedly his tabs are stellar so I&#039;m hoping he pulls through in light of recent events.

				The gamma team is incredibly professional. If they list it as acid, and say that it&#039;s good, you can trust them. They have been vending for a loooong time now.

				they have been vending for under a year so wont say its long time, <br /><br />Regarding Tessellated i just saw it was a 200m blotter, so actually not as expensive as i thout <br /><br />And just to be clear i am not accusing GG of selling anything but the real stuff, i just read some complaints about bitterness and for me that is kind of a no go
