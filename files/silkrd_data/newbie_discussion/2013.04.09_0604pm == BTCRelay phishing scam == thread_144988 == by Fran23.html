				seems someone managed to withdraw my bitcoins from SR account. just confirmed from SR Support that i must of fell for phishing scam. straight after messaging SR Support after noticing 0BTC in my account, i was contacted by BTCRelay saying that the transaction hadn&#039;t made it through the tumbler, and that it was halted and i&#039;d receive my coins back. now im thinking that BTCRelay is part of the scam as i didnt think it was possible to cancel a transaction. i just cant remember falling for a phishing scam as i had SR bookmarked.

				Did BTRelay ask you for your silkroad credentials? If not, I don&#039;t see how it could&#039;ve stolen your coins... Maybe a relative saw your pin and stole your money?

				no, didn&#039;t get them back. BTCRelay said that they would be in escrow in 24hours. that was about 29 hours ago. i basically made this thread to find out if BTCRelay was the scammer or if BTCRelay was somehow related to SR. what happened was.... i messaged&nbsp; SR Support&nbsp; 10 mins after finding out my BTC were gone and got a quick reply from BTCRelay to say that it must be some bug and that the transaction was stopped. BTCRelay must of had my login details and seen i sent a message to SR Support and then replied back to that message with the same topic

				no, impossible for any relative to know my pin. i use Bitcoin Central to buy and transfer bitcoins and they have had a security breach. maybe that was it... if not then i must of fell for phishing scam without even realizing.

				That definitely sounds fishy. I don&#039;t understand what the point would be of those questions, so it doesn&#039;t really look like a scam. Especially since it was after your BTC were gone. I could be missing something though. If your BTC are gone though they are gone. There is no way to get them back, so what he said is obviously false, and couldn&#039;t be from SR. It just doesn&#039;t make sense. It&#039;s obviously related somehow, but I don&#039;t see where the scam part comes in. Unless there is something coming later.<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d just make a new account and forget about the old one. I wouldn&#039;t trust using that account ever again.&nbsp; If you have trust built up with certain vendors you can probably message them that you are changing accounts.

				the point of the questions were to make sure i was the original owner of the account and not the person who made the transaction in the first place.<br />here is a quote of what else he said<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I believe an attacker is using a cross site scripting vulnerability to have code cached along with legitimate data. This could trick a user into automatically withdrawing funds without realizing it. Fortunately the transfer was halted, and it does not appear that any credentials were compromised.<br /><br />To help us pinpoint the attack, do you recall if SR showed any warnings when you logged back in the first time finding 0 BTC? There are several automated warnings that appear in red on the top of the home screen when you first log in.<br /><br />Did any seller have a product link that resulted in suspicious activity after being clicked. ie. Getting redirected to an account page, or being logged out.<br /><br />What service did you use to transfer bitcoins to SR? There has been problems in the past with targeted exploits to users after transferring funds with some services.<br /><br />I will follow up with any new information as everything is processed. Your bitcoins will be moved to escrow in 24 hours.<br /><br />Thank you for your understanding</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				You might consider the possibility that this person is, in fact, batshit crazy. They obviously stole your bitcoins somehow, but I don&#039;t see how that message would help with anything. Maybe this person, who is a scammer, also wanted to fuck with your head.<br /><br />It could be possible that there is something else going on. Usually confidence scams don&#039;t work in the way you might think. An attacker gains confidence in some manner, and manipulates your actions in a way that only makes sense after you realize the scam. By then it&#039;s too late.<br /><br />I guess you should listen to SR support if they get back to you. From looking at the forums, it seems like they&#039;ve been pretty swamped lately. Like I said though, if I were you I would just consider it a loss and move on. Ditch the account and start over. Maybe the attacker has some other way in. If you are using Windows. Stop using Windows. If you are using Mac. Reinstall it. You really should be using linux, or FreeBSD if you have more time to learn about. Ideally you should only access SR in a clean virtual machine on top of a clean OS. For better protection use two virtual machines. One to connect to tor and filter all traffic. The second routes all traffic through the first VM, ensuring nothing leaks outside the tor network. With VMs it&#039;s easy to make snapshots, and open a clean image whenever you need it.<br /><br />Assess your current security measures, and try to find anywhere you could have slipped up. It doesn&#039;t look like Bitcoin Central has anything to do with it. The question and comment about where you got your bitcoins was likely a diversion. Maybe the attacker wanted you to feel confident that you had identified the problem. The message was designed to sound like it was some isolated problem and you had resolved it. Additionally, by changing to a different source for bitcoins you would feel more confident next time you bought bitcoins. Maybe that is what the attacker really wants. Maybe this attacker has access to your computer through some unrelated exploit, and can get back into your account at will. So the confidence scam there would be making you feel better, and waiting for you to deposit more into SR, which would also be stolen.<br /><br />Then again, batshit crazy would also explain it pretty well. So I would start fresh with a new account, and enhanced security never hurts.&nbsp; You never know what a scammer is trying to do, so your best bet is to just move on.
