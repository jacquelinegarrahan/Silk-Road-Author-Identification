				So I bought some coke from a vendor on here who had pretty good reviews. First time doing coke, inhaled about 70mg for the first time. <br />I didn&#039;t feel anything at all - the only thing that happened was my throat got SUPER SUPER numb and I could barely feel myself swallow or taste anything that I drank (ie water). <br />Didn&#039;t get any euphoria, no speediness, no feelings of confidence, nothing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading that all HQ cocaine you&#039;re supposed to be set with 25-50 mg. Maybe this is bunk stuff? Or maybe I just need more? Or maybe I swallowing everything after inhaling it instead of it sticking to the membranes?<br /><br />

I think you can divulge that without coming across as trashing their product, your just a C newbie with Q&#039;s. The numbness is a sign that it did do something for ya, so the Q is do you just need more , or, are you just expecting something in your mind that isn&#039;t quite in line with what C does to you, or, is it cut up with just a numbing agent? The reason I ask who thew vendor is , is, because I&#039;ve tried&nbsp; lot of them and have a decent take on who&#039;s got the good goods.

				The way you describe the numbness sounds too much. Coke only causes a mild numbness. It&#039;s possible that it was cut with dental anesthetic.<br /><br />Get an EZ Test cocaine cut testing kit. They&#039;re worth every penny, and you only use about 10mg of powder to test it.

				Thanks for the replies guys<br /><br />Yoda - I just may have to<br /><br />88fxstc - I got it from MariosGramShoppe. I wanted to wait and get it from Rails or Studio54 because I&#039;ve read their stuff is the best, but I needed it for this weekend so it was the only one I could find with decent reviews I could get in short time. <br /><br />moneyisthereason - Yeah I&#039;m going to again this weekend, i won&#039;t write it off just yet. <br /><br />isallmememe - so far, MDMA &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coke<br /><br />acfood - that&#039;s what I was thinking too - it felt way too much like lidocaine or some other numbing agent. I meant i couldn&#039;t feel ANYTHING in my throat...i was kinda freaking out for a minute. My friend has a kit, I&#039;m gonna borrow theirs this weekend. <br /><br />nassy - I draw the line at snorting. No IVs for me!

				It does that for some people, especially if you have adhd. It makes me feel more straight than I was before I took it, usually ruins a good night out. I&#039;ve had coke-head mates tell me the stuff we&#039;re taking is the best they ever had but it did nothing for me. Makes me jealous when I see how high they are. Much prefer speed myself anyway but it&#039;s less socially acceptable these days. The numbness is a good sign surely?

				I like to do coke once in a while but the good stuff is $150 a gram.<br /><br />I prefer to do amphet if you can find a good dealer the best dealer here imo has the amphet salt for about $130 for five grams.<br /><br />Only thing you have to run customs if you are outside Netherlands 100mg last you a day if you have no tolerance too.<br /><br />Much more bang for your buck.<br /><br />Unless you are Australian then a lot won&#039;t ship it there.

				good coke is a subtle buzz, you don&#039;t get a rush or anything, it&#039;s only when you catch yourself talking non stop about anything and everything you realise how good the gear is. as soon as you catch yourself doing this your self confidence goes through the roof<br /><br />and good coke is not very numbing at all. it is a bit, but that line from the film Blow &#039;i can&#039;t feel my face&#039; is total bollocks

				I think some people like myself just don&#039;t have the chemistry to feel it. I have an insane tolerance to stimulants but none what so ever to psychedelics. It&#039;s just who you are you know? I&#039;ve tried so many peoples Coca cola that was the &quot;shit&quot; and have always been sorely dissapointed no matter who ive tried it from and how much ive done nothing more than a numb throat, and a nasty drip. I&#039;ve split a up a whole 40 into two lines before *snoooooort* NADA so maybe youre just someone like me, who doesn&#039;t get to enjoy booga shuga :/

				You got a great testing kit you carry about it is your hooter.<br /><br />First time I ever did good coke it went up my nose like air and the buzz from it was nothing like speed at one stage I actually felt floaty like I was going to rise to the ceiling and never sweated at all on it and no heart race at all and next day like I had not taking anything did not even need a benzo to sleep or one for making me feel better next day.<br /><br />Did some mid grade coke on here started sweating like a pig my heart started racing which did calm down , strange buzz to it after a while I had enough took 3 x 10mg valium took the funny head buzz away but could still not sleep and was up 12 hours and felt like shit .I think it was a mixture of coke , speed , caffeine and dunno what else still got half of it left 6 weeks later as I never liked it much.<br /><br />If I don&#039;t flush it I&#039;d only do one line at a day of it for a morning kickstart.<br />But I decided to buy from the top sellers from that and pay the extra coin.<br /><br />Oh yeah I have learnt how to wash now though with acetone&nbsp; since then so might do that with it.

				Ummm, you should feel coke&#039;s effects even if it&#039;s just one line. Did it burn? I respectfully disagree with those that say it doesn&#039;t numb or that it&#039;s a mild buzz. But then again, I can put away a gram in a less than 2-3 hours. There&#039;s nothing mild about coke. It&#039;s way more intense than amphetamine, but it doesn&#039;t last anywhere near as long (and it&#039;s not anywhere near as good as amps for sex) ;)<br /><br />It does have a very distinctive smell and lovely drips though. That I agree with&nbsp; ;D

				I wanted to comment cause I also received some product from Mario within the last two maybe three weeks.&nbsp; It was pretty decent stuff in my opinion, better than most of the stuff I find on the street.&nbsp; It&#039;s my go to when it comes to the harder drugs but I space out my purchases for multiple reasons.&nbsp; I like it too much and cant let it sit around for too long.&nbsp; I shared some of this batch with a good friend who has similar experience and he was also quite happy with Mario&#039;s product.<br /><br />I&#039;d say give it another shot, but spread a couple doses out over an hour time period or so till you get the feel for it.&nbsp; Lines about the size of a matchstick should do you pretty good but expect your tolerance to build quickly through the night/days.&nbsp; At certain points its best to just put it away and take a break otherwise it almost seems like a waste.

Coke may sometimes be cut with novacaine, but coke itself is a local anesthetic. It&#039;s still used as a local anesthetic. That&#039;s why it&#039;s a Schedule 2 drug i the US; it has a medical use and it&#039;s still in use (very, very, rarely). The reason it&#039;s cut with novacaine is because they both have a strong numbing effect.<br /><br />Yeah that&#039;s right, the US government feels medical grade marijuana is more dangerous than medical grade cocaine.

				Experienced the same thing the first time I tried it, just had some numbness in in back of my throat/nasal passage from snorting. Didn&#039;t touch the stuff for about six months thinking it was a waste of time. When I had the next line six months later got totally blasted. For me, it&#039;s almost like the body has to get acclimatised to some drugs before experiencing the full effects.

				Ive seen what I have know to be excellent coke not do much for individuals.. Do opiates make you really wired and talkative, nervous and somewhat nauseous like drinking too much coffee, if so you are one of those in a very slim minority&nbsp; that are wired a bit different.&nbsp; You are also likely to be bi-polar.&nbsp; If by chance I hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; don&#039;t do coke. I ve heard a correlation between the reverse wiring and coke to heart stoppage from small amounts. Here again I don&#039;t want to be the alarmist. just saying there is that slim to none possibility.

				Years ago, the first time I ever tried coke, I remember that it had very little effect on me as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;The second time, and every single time after that, I felt it way stronger!&nbsp; Be careful because the stuff feels so good it&#039;s hard to stop sometimes!

Biologically, cocaine acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor, also known as a triple reuptake inhibitor (TRI). It is addictive because of its effect on the mesolimbic reward pathway.<br /><br />Cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant. Its effects can last from 15–30 minutes to an hour, depending on dosage and the route of administration.<br /><br />Cocaine increases alertness, feelings of well-being and euphoria, energy and motor activity, feelings of competence and sexuality. Athletic performance may be enhanced in sports where sustained attention and endurance is required. Anxiety, paranoia and restlessness can also occur, especially during the comedown. With excessive dosage, tremors, convulsions and increased body temperature are observed&quot;<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine (clearnet)<br /><br />From NIH:<br />&quot;Cocaine speeds up your whole body.

Cocaine is typically a white-ish powder with a bitter, numbing taste. It is most often insufflated (snorted), though it can also be injected and used orally.<br /><br />Law <br />Cocaine is illegal to possess and sell in the United States (schedule II) and in most other countries.

				Hmmm....must not be very good. You should be honest w/ your review, and help the community.<br /><br />If it&#039;s good coke, then you would know. They should have at least given you the decency of cutting it with amphetamines or something, rather than baking soda. <br /><br />Do a test - put some on your gums, and if in 5-10 mins it&#039;s completely numb, then it&#039;s good stuff (at least has a decent percentage of coke). If it doesn&#039;t, then I&#039;m quite sorry.<br /><br />Also, different drugs affect people differently.

				UPDATE from OP<br /><br />so I had 2/3 days to experiment again with the same coke this weekend. I completely fucked up when I tried it last week. I tried it again, and literally within 10 seconds i got hit with a wave of pure awesomeness - I literally looked up at my friends after inhaling it and said &quot;Wow I fucking feel amazing riht now.&quot; Just a rush to my head, i felt like my brain was numb, and I had a lot of energy for about 1 hour or so. <br /><br />What I did wrong last week was I didn&#039;t completely crush the hard balls of coke into fine powder, so I ended up inhaling the balls and then directly swallowing them bc they were too big to go up my nose, hence the full numbing of the throat. My throat barely got numb when I did it this past weekend. I also drank 1 beer about an hour before doing the coke, so I&#039;m sure that played a part into it. I did about 80mg one day, the day I felt amazing, and the next day my friends all wantedt to do it so I probably did a total of 40-50mg, didn&#039;t get hit with a sudden sense of awesomeness but still felt like i had more energy than usual. <br /><br />it&#039;s good stuff, quick on quick off, but I think i still prefer MDMA. I can see myself using it once in a while for select outings. <br /><br />thanks for the help guys, hope this helps some of you other guys other there!

For your information my habit makes yours look like you&#039;re trying to give up sugar in your coffee, and for the 1st 3 years of my habit i thought coke was supposed to completely numb you and give you a rush. then i got hold of the real McCoy, and now i won&#039;t entertain street shite unless i&#039;ve put it through a couple of washes myself, which usually turns my henrys into about a gram if i&#039;m lucky. and i&#039;m STILL asking questions and learning about it.<br /><br />i&#039;m not arguing about it, i was trying to help you not get robbed or develop any health problems. if you&#039;re happy snorting something that makes your whole head go numb and for your heart try to beat its way out of your ribcage then you just carry on enjoying your tweaking powder.<br /><br />one thing about your post did confuse me though:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">That &quot;medical use&quot; is as a topical anesthetic. &lt;snip&gt;heroin,&lt;snip&gt;which are Schedule One. Schedule 1:<br />&quot;Schedule I substances are those that have the following findings:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;SNIP&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so the hospitals over there don&#039;t use diamorphine on patients that are in extreme pain?? is that right?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First, no they do not use heroin for pain. That is done in the UK but not the US. Here it would be methadone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, fentanyl, etc. for pain.<br /><br />Second, I don&#039;t think that you&#039;re right. I may have overstated the level of numbness, but cocaine is a topical anesthetic and is used for local anesthesia for some non-invasive surgical procedures in the US (rarely). Two of those sources indicate numbness and all three indicate euphoria and elevated mood/stimulation, which is what I meant when I said rush. To me, a rush is euphoria.<br /><br />I&#039;m not arrogant about my former use of cocaine; I&#039;m not interested in learning anything about cocaine. I don&#039;t ever plan on using cocaine again now that I have moved on to Adderall. <br /><br />I did not ever say anything about my whole head going numb. I was specifically referring to drips and the numbing effect they have on the throat and the &quot;numbing taste&quot; (mentioned in one of the sources) that many people enjoy (you know, like taking your finger and picking up the residual powder left over from your line and rubbing on your gums? You&#039;ve never seen someone take a lick after their line?)<br /><br />I also didn&#039;t say anything about my heart beating out of my rib cage. Once my friend and I split a 16th in all of about 10-15 minutes. In that case, my heart was racing, but not if I were to take it slow. You can&#039;t deny that if you snorted an 8 ball in an hour that your heart would race. Cocaine&#039;s effects don&#039;t last very long, and I was referring to snorting a large quantity in a short period of time. With that said, I feel what I consider to be a rush from the very first line.<br /><br />And finally, no I did not neg you for disagreeing with me. That&#039;s ridiculous; you&#039;re free to disagree with me. I wouldn&#039;t neg you for that. And who cares anyway?<br /><br /><br />This isn&#039;t a pissing match over who had the biggest habit btw.<br /><br />You&#039;re incorrectly assuming that I&#039;m upset with you. I have nothing against you and you are entitled to your opinion.

				I just found what seems a perhaps relevant comment DoctorX made in his advice thread last month:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147607.msg1538969#msg1538969">Quote from: DoctorX on September 15, 2013, 09:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">“Rush” is uncommon in first experiences with some drugs. Effects of drugs are explained mainly by neuropharmacology but there are also psychological and social factors. Learning processes are important to recognize and process effects of drugs, so first experiences are not necessarily the best. Regular use is more associated with “rush” than occasional experiences. But, for example, administration of intranasal placebo (local anesthesic) to cocaine addicts can produce physical effects (tachycardia, raise of blood pressure) similar to cocaine. So even placebo effect can explain ( a part) of some drug effects.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Perhaps &#039;rush&#039;, at least as we mean it in Britain (and in Spain, judging from DoctorX&#039;s comment), could be described as the exhilarating feeling of speeding toward the destination rather than what we feel once we&#039;ve got there.
