				Probably get shot down for asking this but has anyone had any experience with Atlantis good,bad or indifferent?<br />I only ask as i&#039;m 100% loyal buyer on the road but i was toying with the idea of a vendor account over there as i&#039;m a bit too small time for here at the moment.<br />Thanks people!

				just my two cents.<br />Atlantis does not go down well here from what i have seen, the site is kinda crap in my opinion might have lots of bells and whistles, but there so small time and have not made any great strides since launch, there is of course blackmarket reloaded but over there its dog eat dog world, weird feedback system only run by one person which is not good if something happened to him/her..<br /><br />God forbid if anything should happen with Inigo or DPR, with two people at the helm we stand a much better odds.<br /><br />ohh and atlantis apparently are over here pretending to be forum users but in fact trying to promote it prolly by any means they can.&nbsp; as i said just my two cents worth.

				I agree with Red Eye&#039;s opinion. Atlantis has some cool bells and whistles and a nice song and dance, but in the end that&#039;s all it is. In this game, Loyalty-Respect-Confidence-History-Reptuation are all more important than a few bells and whistles that are little more than just for show. They like to tout improved security but every new bell and whistle is a new potential vector of vulnerability.

Reading DPR&#039;s posts you can see he is very sincere. Anyone can do a job they hate as long as they&#039;re getting paid, but you can tell they hate serving you. On the flip side, when you have vendors who enjoy what they&#039;re doing, and produce excellent product (thinking weed here), and have a passion for the product, and know what they&#039;re doing to get it to you safely, and are nice in the process ... well ... that is just priceless. Thank you SR!

				I&#039;m starting to get the picture i had no idea of threats ect i only usualy go on forums in downtime to work out whats going on&nbsp; &nbsp;:-[<br /><br />I agree with all you are saying about DPR(from the little i know)he/she/they are total legends and are totaly dedicated to this site and it&#039;s user&#039;s,i&#039;d go so far to say i love it here i&#039;ve only ever had one purchase go wrong and the customer service&nbsp; for SR&nbsp; was literally better than ebay!<br /><br />In conclusion your all right i&#039;m being too hasty and slightly disloyal(never thought of it like that as buyer/seller thing i differed) think i just liked the thought of it ,Thanks for replys and not shooting me down!

				I think you&#039;ve got a completely legitimate question. One benefit to having an account elsewhere with a couple buys maybe and allowed to age is that if forbid something should happen to SR longterm, then there&#039;s a backup marketplace/source. Or at least getting in good with the best vendors on SR of what you like to buy and saving their tormail or other contact info in case SR is down. But on Atlantis I see only a couple vendors that have the product I&#039;m looking for, and I suspect based on wording in their profiles / vendor pages that they&#039;re the same vendors that are on SR.

				Totally went off the idea after your feedback but just out of curiosity made a small purchase to a different address than normal,just to see what happened.Turned up fine and it did make me laugh though as it was a vendor&nbsp; i&#039;ve used on SR before(won&#039;t go into detail but i knew!) just under a different name on atlantis&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)&nbsp;
