				Hi SK users 8)<br /><br />My boyfriend and I have bought a single Oxycotin, this is the first time we have done this and wanted to ask peoples advice. We have used heroin lots of times before, however, we do not inject. Is it best to take the Oxycotin orally, crush it up and snort it, or, take it some other way? What would you guys recommend? We have read lots of information and it seems that the American version has some kind of new recipe so it can&#039;t be abused as easily, but we have heard that the UK ones don&#039;t have this problem and are like the old ones, but we wanted your advice. We have bought from a UK vendor and we live in the UK. There seems to be so many different opinions on this. Can you help us? :)<br /><br />Many thanks in advance&nbsp; ;D<br />

				OK... well my initial reaction was to tell u to bang it but you don&#039;t shoot so your next best option is to snort it IMO.&nbsp; You&#039;re right, there&#039;s going to probably be a waxy layer covering it (which will have to be removed no matter how you take it unless orally). Just pop it in your mouth for a second and then wipe it off with a towel or something until that layer is off. You&#039;ll see a subtle difference in the color, maybe a big one depending on the pill color. Your pill might also not crush very easily - they&#039;ve been putting crap in the pills also to prevent this as well- you have to kind of shave it down with a razor blade or one of those darned ped-egg things works wonders! That&#039;s as good as it gets... unless you&#039;re interested in booty bumping it lol. You&#039;re gonna have to google for instructions on that though- I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s da bomb but could never quite bring myself to go there.... good luck!
