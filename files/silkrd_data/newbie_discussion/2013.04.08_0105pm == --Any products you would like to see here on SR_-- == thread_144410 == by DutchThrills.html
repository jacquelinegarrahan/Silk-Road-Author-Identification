				HEY FUN LOVERS &amp; RAVERS,<br />As said on our previous post, today the DutchThrills store opened its doors but we have no where near enough stock to cover the demand we expect but should do in a week or so.<br />We always get the very best products at very good prices from our contacts who have been in this game for many many years.<br />Is there any product in particular we should try to source, perhaps something hard to get/expensive - chances are we will be able to!

				Barbiturates (except phenobarbital) are really hard to find and it would be nice to have some.. Exotic opiates would also be good, A lot of good ones are available by prescription in the Netherlands apparently so you might be able to source some perhaps.

				Thank for all the replies- we appreciate input very much so.<br />Barbiturates are probably the one product which is hardest for us to get- we lab test all of our goods with a couple of Dutch labs near by and the last two times we bought &quot;Mandys&quot; for a UK client we had them tested and contained no barbiturates- not even phenobarbital.<br />We have got good ones a couple times a while ago (maybe 6 months+) so there is a chance but more and more fakes seem to flood market now, much more so than before.<br />Tomorrow we contact our supplier of pharmaceuticals and ask about these but we will not sell any unless the lab results are in order and if they are we will only offer low dose pressed pills since OD on these was a big problem some years back here in Holland.<br />Every day we see papers report OD and it caused much stigma here which sort of reduced demand and chemists just begin making more up and coming goods like Ecstacy.<br />We can get almost as much Ecstacy you like within a week or so- supply is crazy, we have never had to reject an order due to supply problem.<br />Hookers- indeed we can offer, but only for face to face deals as even our stealth shipping is tricky for hookers but feel free to come over, we take payment in BTC and give you best hooker in town&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br />-D.T.-<br />P.S. We are just about to launch our lotto- we will be shipping 5 free samples to 5 winners worldwide. Tickets will be 0.01 since we are unable to make free listings. See our review thread or vendor page for more info.

				I&#039;d like to see some barbiturates too, but they must be really hard to get I imagine... What other rare pharms could you get?

				Cocaine- no problem.<br />None of our cocaine is ever cut and is always very pure. Never 100% but this is due to the process not because some greedy dealer in the chain added something, its just unavoidable inactive cuts which are perfectly safe, just dont get you very high. The actual cocaine content of the batch I personally tried last weekend was said to be over 70% - felt good enough to order a sizable amount to get us moving but we will know exactly when it is sent to the lab (it will almost certainly be as sold, as in Holland or at least where we are based many labs are available who will test any product and every dealer big or small knows this so doesnt even try lying about purity).<br />We can get all sorts of Pharmaceuticals but is not my area of expertise or something we have done alot of in the past but yes we do indeed know who to call and will find out what is on offer and for how much.<br />My concern with Pharms is that we must buy every product in very high volumes and in my experience these dont move as quickly as the other products which we are more experienced with- maybe Silk Road will show me wrong on that.<br />As to LSD - we can offer this at very good rates especially in bulk. Maybe the cheapest here but if not probably the cheapest for dosage as im sure much LSD sold here is not dosed correctly where as ours will be as exact as possible - we have been buying LSD from the same source for years and had many batches tested without ever finding a dry tab or under/over ones.<br />We are sending very generous samples soon, for a shot see our lotto here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5974e65ed6
