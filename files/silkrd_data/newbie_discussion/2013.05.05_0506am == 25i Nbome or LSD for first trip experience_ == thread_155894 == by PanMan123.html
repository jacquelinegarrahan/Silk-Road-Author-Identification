				Iv read multiple trip reports of both substances they both seem to be fine. They seems to differ in slight ways but i just can&#039;t seem to decide what to drop the first time.

				To be honest you should probably try the nbome first. Get used to the visuals and body load with that, then move on to LSD and play around with the head space it brings with it.

				Dude, LSD, no contest.<br /><br />25I-NBOMe is decent, don&#039;t get me wrong, but 25I-NBOMe is a light show. LSD is an education.

				LSD all the way. Its nicer to your body and is just a brilliant substance overall. You really can&#039;t go wrong with it. Just make sure you&#039;re comfortable when you drop it.

				Definitely LSD. I&#039;d highly recommend getting a good friend who you trust (even better if they&#039;d done hallucinogenics themselves) to be a trip sitter for you. Maybe have a benzo or two ready just in case to help calm you down or fall asleep in a worst case scenario. Either way have fun and party safe.

				LSD. A way deeper headspace and better exploring drug.

				I would definitely echo the sentiment to have a trustworthy sitter that can ride it out with you particularly if you choose LSD as your first trip. First time I ever dropped, I was with a group that ended up crashing many hours before I did leaving me alone with my head. It was an &quot;interesting&quot; experience. Damn &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; dolls give me nightmares now though!

				I would recommend Psilocybe Mushrooms, just because I feel they kind of force the spiritual aspect of the trip onto the user, whereas you have to &quot;find&quot; it with other Hallucinogens I&#039;ve tried (LSD, 25c NBOME). But if you have to choose between the two, I would say LSD. It&#039;s safer, more lucid, and superior in my opinion to the NBOME series drugs. I dropped 800ug of 25c when I tried it and that was one of the most visually intense trips I&#039;ve ever had; if not for my previous experience with other psychedelics I fear that trip would have ended much more differently.

				I haven&#039;t tried 25i but I&#039;ve indulged in LSD and its absolutely amazing. If you want to try a psychedelic that instills lucid thinking, creative mind processes, colorful and fluid OEV, increased awareness to sound, no body load, and no taste then LSD is your go to buddy!!! Had some great times on ole Lucy.

				Honestly ignore everything that is posted here because whatever you choose you will have second thoughts about not choosing the other because of what people said here. They are similar in my only recommendation is that if you do 25i and not lsd that you should definitely do lsd at some point. Make a decision on your own and be confident in it. I did lsd first and was then able to control 25i really well to create visuals. Just remember that once you do it there is no backing out so plan for 10 hours of a calm safe place and venture out when you feel ready.

				I tried LSD for the first time a week ago. I was on my own. I&#039;d say dose was about 150 ug, as I didn&#039;t get a lot out of the first blotter (redose 1-2 hours later) although that could just be me messing up with the dosing. It was one of the most interesting experiences in my life. Felt fairly safe too. First trip in many years (done shrooms once which was boring and a bunch of ecstasy, I&#039;ll never know what I got in those). <br /><br />Sometimes it was a bit overwhelming for my senses, and I did have a bit of megalomania and such, but overall it was quite managable.<br /><br />I have read negative things about the NBOMe&#039;s, although mostly related to overdosing. I&#039;d try LSD first.
