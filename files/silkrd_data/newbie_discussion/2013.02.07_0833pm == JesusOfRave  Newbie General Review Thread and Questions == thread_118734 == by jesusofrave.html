				@iLBC - nice to meet ya.<br />@blojan - not everyone reviews everytime. reviews do help fellow community members get a good idea of other peoples experiences of current batches of products which makes life easier - it is the equivalent of looking at clothing on a model that has a similar body size shape etc.... <br />-for price of shipping there is a little button with the shipping available with the BTC price next to it.<br />- not sure what you mean by trades? If you are asking would I accept your left shoe for an XTC pill - then most vendors should and will say no - no vendor will or should ever give any information about themself - for example - how would i get your left shoe without giving you my address in heaven/hell?<br /><br />@MS - the avengers are a good crew :)&nbsp; we try to be one of the good ones. all we can do is treat each person by their own merits.<br /><br />jor

				@ LK - as it says in the product description they have been trip tested at between 80-90ug.<br /><br />We will be laying some books (sheet of 1000) ourselves at the end of feb and will be have two different dosages - 300ug and 110ug.... We will also be resuspended some of the XTAL to make up some vials.<br /><br />@blojan - if they mention in their profile then it should follow that they aren&#039;t offended by a question. It is curious however - how do THEY know that the person they are trading with is not just posing as a vendor to try and get their location details?.... <br /><br />@frapp - there is some crap out there. All of the hashes we vend are great - as the feedback shows. If I were to go for one, then it would be the fez cream, or the High definition.... but they are all worth trying - especially a thai weed, with hash and a small bit of tobacco. really great. Many of the hashes are great in a bowl just by themselves.<br /><br />jor

				Ordered some of the spanish cheapy on wednesday, arrived today. Delivery times as stated and the product itself looks pretty good for the price! My 3rd order on SR, this one went the smoothest. No questions, no FE just order arrive and finalise. Great stuff.<br /><br />Also made an order from mrcronk at the same time on wednesday, no sign of that one yet.

				- WoW - that is amazing news with that laid cristal coming! looking forward to make a first purchase out of uK for a blotter. sweet smell of lotus for the win. though, a vial sounds too inviting, too, i have to admit..... omg - yummy! :)<br /><br />the range of hashes seems nearly unignorable. even when i try to stick to domestic, esp. with cannabis. wondering how a shipping out of uk to a neighbour country would be safe stealth-wise. what delicious ideas of a package in the postage&nbsp; with a nice variety from black charas and&nbsp; hdefinition pollen to caramellos and morrocan creams .. mhm, sounds too inviting and good to be true. jesus, i see you smiling! *BLING

				Did order 1 tab of LSD from JOR last week to test the product. Got delivered to west EU within 48 hours after ordering, pretty fast! Dropped the tab the day it arrived :)<br /><br />The tab felt clean, but wasn&#039;t the strongest I had. I guess the advertised ~80-90ug would be correct. <br />Had a nice trip at home, euphoria on the come up, felt at peace with the world and had some nice insights. Visuals weren&#039;t that strong, but that&#039;s to be expected with this dose i guess. Hardly any bodyload. <br /><br />All in all a nice product, and a vendor that ships very fast, recommended! Think I&#039;ll wait for the new batch (laid stronger with same crystal right?) and place a bigger order.

We&#039;ve got three different sources of MDMA for you all to try atm...<br /><br />We would highly recommend reading vendors profiles (you can do this by clicking their username). You should find their position re FE - for example this is our required reading:<br /><br /><br />=====START=OF=REQUIRED=READING=====<br />► By placing an order with us you agree to all of the terms and conditions.<br />► If you claim your product does not arrive, you qualify for a one time only refund of 30% maximum.<br />► Long standing clients will receive higher refund rates in case of non-arrival.<br />► NO REFUNDS for customers with &lt; 10 orders / &lt;$250 value of purchases<br />► We will never resend product in the case of non-arrival.<br />► Minimum 25 days transit time must pass before a refund may be granted.<br />► Orders taken to the resolution center early do not qualify for a refund. Contact us first!<br />► We will not refund outside of the resolution center.<br />► Therefore, do not finalize early.<br />► Please use the resolution center if there is a problem.<br />► We reserve the right to cancel any order for any reason.<br />► Keep all questions simple and in the subject line if possible.<br />► Do not send Privnote.<br />► All orders must be placed through Silk Road. Bitcoin only.<br />► We do not send samples.<br />► If for whatever reason you aren&#039;t satisfied with your order, contact us immediately before leaving feedback.<br />► Zero exceptions to these terms and conditions.<br /><br />=====END=OF=REQUIRED=READING=====<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&lt;7.&gt;<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;• ESCROW / EARLY FINALIZATION:&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />We do not work outside of escrow. Please do not FE, EVER.<br /><br />This means that if you don&#039;t have any stats message me first. If you do not, we may cancel your order, and if times are busy we may not give you a heads up that we have. This is nothing personal against new people, it&#039;s just that the only accounts we have been scammed by are those with &lt; 5 transactions. Please bare this in mind.<br /><br />Please also have a look at the Refund policy.<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Each vendor will have a different approach. We accept orders from all new customers but protect ourselves with the above terms. <br /><br /><br />@kissthemoon - the stronger tabs will be laid with higher quality XTAL.... referred to as Christ XTAL, the one you will have tried is Lotus.. :)<br /><br />jor

				Just going to bump this thread as I am still pretty fresh here myself.<br /><br />Received some lovely Moroccan Fez hash from JOR today. Great stealth packaging and quick delivery as usual, despite the downtime. I would say the smoke is leaning towards the &quot;indica&quot; end of the spectrum, although I didn&#039;t find it too gouchy at all.<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for drugs that actually match the vendors description then you can&#039;t go wrong with Jesus of Rave :)<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT - Dude, down below ---vvv&nbsp; Don&#039;t spam the useful threads!

I&#039;m an experienced tripper and had been tuned into/lurking around the SR for about a year but just moved to a new city with no connects and finally decided to dive in.<br /><br />How is your current status w/ shipping to the US? I&#039;d like to use SR mainly for acid and maybe some scripts. I was directed to the Avenger&#039;s forum to get up to speed on who to trust for buying. Seems like some folks in UK/EUR like HollandOnline have had trouble shipping to US and are going to stop for a while. Your reviews are great and I&#039;d like to buy so will you guys continue shipping &#039;cid to US?<br /><br />Thanks so much,<br />Ongtoq

				JoR sold me my first acid trip. It was nice :) .. Thank you JoR!<br /><br />Best stealth I&#039;ve seen so far out of 4 vendors and good product.<br /><br />If you are ever at a crossroads in your life, unsure of where to go, ask yourself; what would Jesus of Rave do? He would sell you great drugs. Sell yourself great drugs.

				Hey JoR! I saw that you are taking a break from the vials. I hope it&#039;s not too long! I definitely been needing to get one but I just want to make a few smaller transactions first. Liquid LSD is unheard of where I am.

				Hey there Noobs....I just saw this thread about one of Silk Road&#039;s finest vendors and a friend to all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve placed several orders with JoR and have had nothing but Success and Good Vibes in all of them.&nbsp; The one time I had an issue JoR made sure it was right.&nbsp; &nbsp;He is one of the best communicators on SR....as you would expect from a man named Jesus.<br /><br />He has great product and THE BEST LIQUID LSD on the road.&nbsp; &nbsp;He just listed more that seems to go quick so don&#039;t delay or just wait till next time I guess kicking yourself over your indecision and timing when you read about all the others who took the next step and placed their order.&nbsp; &nbsp;He has it in 3 sizes too depending on your needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;ACT NOW before it goes and YES HE SHIPS IT MOST ANYWHERE and of course to the USA.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />****NOTE TO HOLLANDONLINE this is JoR&#039;s thread and you can start your own thread instead of posting in JoR&#039;s to announce your strange decision to stop shipping to the USA and a few other places.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now people are asking JoR if he ships to the USA because of you.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Folks most vendors have no problem shipping to the States...so what does that say when one vendor has issues with his packages making through.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read the avengers thread for all the drama if you must.<br /><br />Anyways JoR is your guy and you can see by his rating and the posts from past customers and what they say about their order arriving safely.&nbsp; <br />Thank you JoR.

				Hi JoR, complete noob here. I&#039;ve been checking out the Hofmann blotters you are selling for a little while now, and now that I finally have some bitcoins I&#039;m closing in on making my first purchase. As a first time buyer, I&#039;m still a little bit apprehensive about something going wrong (like the package not turning up), especially since I am not exactly the richest man in the world right now. From what I have read, you have a really great reputation, but the thought of losing $100+ dollars kinda scares me a bit.<br />So I was just wondering, what is your success rate for packages shipped to New Zealand?<br /><br />Help me put my mind at ease!<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Hey there peis..<br /><br />Our thoughts are this: don&#039;t spend any money on SR that you can&#039;t afford to lose. (similarly we only send out what we can afford to go missing)<br /><br />So it may be worth starting smaller and then building up an idea and trust with a seller, so you get a better idea of if you are happy with the vendors stealth methods etc.<br /><br />Of course we&#039;ll say something like; &quot;Order with us! We have &gt;98% success rate to your side of the world (which is still true)&quot;<br /><br />But if we were new, we would first test the waters.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />jor

				Hi, <br /><br />When I get bored I look into how drugs are synthesized, and I notice you have different &quot;source&quot; Mandy. I know you state that the source is referring to the supplier and not the precursor, but do you happen to know which precursor is used for which source? <br /><br />Or would that be giving away valuable trade secrets?<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />T
