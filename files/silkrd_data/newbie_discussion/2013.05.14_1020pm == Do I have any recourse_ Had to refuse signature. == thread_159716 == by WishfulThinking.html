				So, a USPS Express domestic package I was expecting showed up at my door, accompanied by several suspicious indicators of a controlled delivery. Because I had reasonable enough cause to think it was a CD, I refused signature. I&#039;ve made numerous successful Express transactions, including others from this vendor, and never had to sign.<br /><br />Two questions, then: first, is it possible to recover the package? I don&#039;t know how my vendor operates, and thus don&#039;t know whether a package with my name on it is floating around the dead letter office or is in a recoverable place. My vendor will not respond to messages (he is doing this with other clients as well), but is very active on SR. Because I trusted him and had worked with him before, I finalized, since a CD wouldn&#039;t be his fault. Just trying to be decent, here. For all I know, he may have simply forgotten to check the &quot;waive signature&quot; box, but again, I couldn&#039;t take the risk. I can&#039;t take this to the Resolution Center now. Not smart, I know, but I thought I could at least get some answers from the vendor and work out a deal.<br /><br />Second, isn&#039;t it almost as bad to have a rejected package with one&#039;s real name on it hanging around the dead letter office? What happens if/when they open it? <br /><br />Obviously, forfeiting over $400 of merchandise is a better option than spending time with attorneys and LE, but I&#039;d at least like an idea of what to do next.<br /><br />Totally skrood, or no? Any help is much appreciated.

				Yes your Gut is rarely wrong, and better safe than sorry. But I have signed for an overseas package of 100 grams of methylone before although I knew I was gonna need to sign it. Im sure you will figure out whats up as soon as you get ahold of the vendor. If he for sure says you def should not need to sign for it then I would cut your losses. Are you in the United States? If so did they leave a peach colored sign and pickup note?

				Could ya tell us who the vendor is??? If it was a CD, it could be because his end was compromised somehow and ya might help on of us avoid some bullshit that none of us need.
