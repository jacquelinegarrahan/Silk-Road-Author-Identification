				Being selfless, Helping someone else for no gain of your own...<br /><br />I wonder about who you all are, how you came to be on SR, and most of all, How do ya&#039;ll act IRL?<br /><br />I&#039;m an incredibly giving person who loves to help others, has a profession that fits that description...but I am selfish when I need to be : D

				hey why not? I&#039;ve been here for a while along with other deepweb sites and maintaining altruism, optimism, compassion and empathy can be well almost impossible. SR is ginger beer in comparison to other onion sites out there that will... be very trying on your sanity. I&#039;m not trying to be some self-righteous dick with egoistical morals I&#039;m just saying I like SR because not everyone is constantly a dick or a disgusting despicable human being trying to make everyone else as miserable as they are. Alright well I fucked up my previous sentences, but hey wtf, I don&#039;t care, it is what it is and I TRY to understand instead of judge, but goddamn you haven&#039;t seen some of the most horrible things in the deepweb (or maybe you have) SR to me, or at least the SR forums are a lot like that checkpoint in between waves of zombies where you can sit, catch your breath, reload and prepare yourself for going once more unto the breach.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to regret posting this I know it, but fuck it this is how i feel and how i stay sane, this is what has worked for me and maybe it might work for others. Anyway I&#039;m done forcing my naive wisdom on everyone. one post down 39 more left....

				I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s completely altruistic.... you can be generous enough but I believe there&#039;s some selfish reason behind it. It doesn&#039;t have to be anything bad, maybe you just like the way it makes you feel, or the social status you garner by behaving this way. I like to think I do well in that respect. I help out whenever I can, as long as I have shelter and food I don&#039;t hold money to a high standard like most people. I actually offer to help, not wait until someone asks me for it. <br /><br />I came to SR because I don&#039;t function well without marijuana. It levels me out, keeps me focused and less likely to do stupid shit because I&#039;m impatient or in a bad mood. Its funny because when I lived on the east coast I had no problem finding drugs. Now that I&#039;ve moved to the west where it&#039;s been/being legalized, I can&#039;t find it at all.

I am generous and altruistic for personal motives and psyche. It simply makes me feel better about myself although I don&#039;t have anything to be guilty for or or feel the need to redeem myself. I just want to feel like I am a good person and that I mattered to someone somewhere. Selfishness is in the altruism, being righteous is innately making yourself less humble and wanting praise or social standing in a community. I try to understand what is take to have real humility and stay virtuous at the same time but it is has led me to contradiction. There is a lot going on in SR right now so I&#039;m going to come back to this thread later if someone has responded.

I do what I can for whom I can when I can.&nbsp; A lot of the things I do that people might consider to be altruistic I do because *not* doing so would be unempathetic to a degree I can&#039;t relate to. I definitely wouldn&#039;t be here if it wasn&#039;t for people acting in a similar manner towards me.<br /><br />In short, I think it&#039;s fucked up that acts like providing&nbsp; or helping provide shelter or food for people is considered altruistic nowadays.

				I won&#039;t get into the deeper philosophy of it all, sometimes you can over complicate things that should be simple. I just know I like make or people feel good, laugh or help people (even when they don&#039;t know it).<br />Kinda funny story from when I was living in San Francisco. I noticed someones parking meter was about to run out so I put a quarter in it. Then I walked up the street doing the same, must have put money in five or six meters to stop people getting tickets. The next day I was parked illegally for literall less than 5mins while I ran in to pick up my girlfriend... when I got back to the car I had a fucking ticket on it... so much for karma!

				Sure, but I get to feel good about it too so I suppose it&#039;s not purely selfless.

				I&#039;m one of them. Back in highschool and college, I was the worst dealer you could imagine (or best, depending). Always had the best and most diverse selection, but I was seriously naive. I probably broke even over my dealing career. Was robbed more times than you can count, sometimes just gave shit away. I just wanted to make people have a good time. Eventually I got out of the business end, and now I&#039;m here. I discovered SR a year or so ago, and have made a couple of purchases here. What I really love about the road, is that it seems like the best players here are promoted, and the worst get quickly buried. It has increased the trust in this inherently shady and distrustful business. I mean, how else can dealers ever trust each other? Silkroad makes that possible with escrow, probably a first for the scale its been implemented on. <br /><br />It reminds me of being at a music festival, and just discussing, selling and doing drugs out in the open. Anywho, I would call myself altruistic, but less naive now. Maybe that&#039;s just a step toward growing colder, maybe its wiser. Whatever, fuck it, lets get high.
