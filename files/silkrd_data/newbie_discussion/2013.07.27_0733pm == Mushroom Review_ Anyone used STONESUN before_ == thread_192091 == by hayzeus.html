				So I decided to take a chance on STONESUN.&nbsp; He has been a little unactive for the last couple weeks, but I guess that&#039;s how it goes with mushrooms.&nbsp; You gotta grow more and dry them out!<br /><br />Anybody here tried is Osiris India mushroom strain before?<br /><br />Also, I just went back to check the spelling of the strain on the order I just made 5 minutes ago, and when I went back and clicked on the listing in my &quot;orders&quot; page, the listing was REMOVED.<br /><br />Should I be worried about this at all?&nbsp; Why would the listing be removed 5 minutes after I placed my order.&nbsp; Is this abnormal?<br /><br />

				It could be probably be that,it was the last stock he had or it wasn&#039;t in stock at all,than he might have to cancel your order,in which case you stand to lose some coins.Its always advisable to talk to the vendor b4 placing an order. hope this is of some help.<br /><br />Stay safe<br />bp

				That particular cubensis variety produces very large fruits, if memory is correct. Caps as big as dinner plates, even! Most cubensis are near identical in potency, outside of the mutant Penis Envy variety.&nbsp; <br /><br />Listings are automatically removed once remaining stock falls to zero. That is most likely the issue in your case.

				StoneSun sells cubensis and also spores to grow them!<br /><br />Turned out that I ended up getting his last 2 eighths in stock and SR automatically took down the listing once I ordered them.&nbsp; Thank god it wasn&#039;t something stranger!<br /><br />I will be posting a review as soon as I try them this weekend.&nbsp; They were shipped within 3 days of ordering (this morning), and tracking number was provided.&nbsp; I won&#039;t check the tracking number until Thursday if tey haven&#039;t shown up with the mail by then.
