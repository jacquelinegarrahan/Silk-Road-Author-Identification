				Wanted to start a topic for us noobs. I have ordered from Marlo (aka Carlos), Maestro, DieselTherapy, &amp; have an order processing with DragonCove. I think I have run the gamut at least in quality - Marlos being the best, that &quot;concrete&quot; rock dope that you can cold shoot. With Maestro I only ordered the &quot;Consistent, HIGH QUALITY&quot; Bags, and they were decent. DT was pretty good, quality could have been better but the price is right. Looking forward to DragonCove&#039;s order, the feedback and posts on his stuff is pretty across the board awesome. Also, these guys are also noob friendly, so take note.<br /><br />Please post any comments you have on other vendors!

				Thanks for starting this thread; plenty of us &quot;noobs&quot; are opiate enthusiasts who need just this kind of information. <br /><br />I have to say that I feel kind of gossipy and petty publishing this kind of discussion for [at least semi] public consumption.....however, ethics, communication, and our own willingness to look out for each other and enforce appropriate behavior is pretty much all we all have to rely on in ensuring that a clandestine community runs like clockwork and maintains its professionalism. At least it&#039;s a good opportunity to plug our favorite vendors :-) Still...<br /><br />Okie. During my short tenure with SR, I&#039;ve ordered from Deezletime, Marlo, and Terabithia. The latter was the only real problem, to my personal tastes. As has been exhaustively discussed on a noob thread devoted to the subject [hence my willingness to name the vendor], Tera was officially demoted by SR as a vendor - apparently, the day after I placed my first order. No harm done; SR Support was great on the subject and it must be noted that some T fans suggested there might be a mitigating factor with respect to Tera&#039;s business: some kind of medical emergency. I personally have no idea but found some of the forum posts to be...suspect. <br /><br />Marlo, one order. Despite all the flak this guy/girl is getting in the fora at present, I was generally satisfied with my transaction. It arrived in a timely fashion, excellent stealth, weight on point. The only problem I had with the product was that something in the cut did not agree with me. Since I have not seen anyone else offer any kind of observation to that effect, I assumed that was a matter of personal taste/health quirk [or the like] and did not let it affect the quality of the feedback I left for the transaction. I will say this, though - I only dared to boot that stuff once while I had it - and though I admit it did not cook up terribly dirty [no, I did *NOT* attempt to shoot it cold], there was a minimal amount of particulate matter present following the prep of the IV solution. It wasn&#039;t what I would call &quot;dirty H&quot; by a long scratch; anyone who has ever encountered really dirty H knows we are talking about some nasty cr*p that most of us wouldn&#039;t put in our bodies even if we were sick as dogs. That solution did look oddly murky though - but resulted in no harm. To give credit where it is due with respect to product: the actual dia content was of relatively high/moderately high quality; it was the cut - both kind and quantity - that was the problem. Based on my own experience, this vendor is not on my personal disgrace list but neither is he/she someone I&#039;d be likely to return to for this particular product outside of a pinch. And I&#039;m not really in a position to get in a pinch at the moment, if you take my drift. [On a side note: I made an impulse buy of some C/powder - something I very rarely use - when I made the Marlo/H purchase simply because I saw the listing and really liked the price. The coke was very sparkly, seemed relatively clean, and was of mediocre - possibly a little better quality; it was also well *overweight* if my eyeball estimate counts for anything - no, I did not bother to scale it as I simply didn&#039;t care that much. Not top notch but I imagine only true C-devotees would be willing to pay the kind of prices that top-notch product of that sort can command. I&#039;ve only run into that level of good stuff once or twice in my life purely by accident - and while I am grateful to have had the experience, I&#039;d rather shell out my clams for something I really love...!]<br /><br />Deezletime: one order completed; one placed yesterday. So far, I have to admit that I don&#039;t have any serious complaints to make about this vendor AT ALL. Any vet will take one look at his pics and/or his stamps and recognize the product for exactly what it is: good old-fashioned street dope. [I hadn&#039;t seen street stamps in many years; it made me kinda warm and fuzzy to see the listing, hehe.]&nbsp; Do I like it that his stamps are quite underweight? No. Do I like it that it took a couple of days for him to process my first order? No. Did I like the product, stealth, and pricing? VERY MUCH. I also like it that he does not misrepresent what he is selling at all. Good for sniffing and spiking; IV solution quite clean - to the point, I might actually attempt a cold shoot on my next supply...we&#039;ll see. I&#039;d love to see full weight bags of this same quality stuff but this vendor is basically selling discount street dope....and to give a serious plug where I believe it is due: that discount street dope is stepped on so little [relative to the range of &quot;stepping&quot; a buyer can potentially encounter in such a context] that it might actually be the case that DT doesn&#039;t himself step on it at all; merely splits the weight of the product between stamps. For the money, the dope is a deal - and incidentally, quite effective for insufflation - gentle on the nose but still effective in a recreational context. Unless he gives me a *strong* reason to walk away from him, s/he&#039;s someone I will offer future business when the fancy strikes me.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably going to try another vendor late this evening - if I can make up my mind....! From a purely financial standpoint, I&#039;d prefer to buy by the gram - and with a vendor with intelligent security protocols, strong comms, and - ideally - multiple fast shipping options. I&#039;ve read a bit about Dragoncove and SS but I want to see what the fora say about them...particularly, given some of the costs involved. <br /><br />Hope some of that was helpful - and once again, THANK YOU for starting this thread. I REALLY hope others pick it up. Take care and stay safe. :-)

				I have to say that even though I am a noob on SR I am certainly not a noob to opiates or dope, so I would say that you&#039;re better off here simply for the fact that the danger element (other than ODing from supremely potent product) of dealing with dealers (or worse, sketchy ones), driving to far away places (itself dangerous enough) and worse, with drugs in your possession, and then of course having ZERO assurance other than his &quot;word&quot; that the product is as described. It may take a few tries, but you can find a &quot;regular&quot; vendor for sure. Though there is some turnover I&#039;ve noticed, even with &quot;elitie&quot; vendors - which I consider Marlo to be simply because of his stealth, his pricing, and product - now, there&#039;s obviously better dope out there but it costs TWICE as much as his and for a reason. I am reluctant to order &quot;stamps&quot; --even though I ordered &quot;bags&quot; from maestro which were plastic weed bags not the paper bags street dope is usually sold in-- because though there&#039;s certainly a nostalgia factor, the last few years (2010-2012) where I was using heavily in NYC and there was an abundance of stamps it was more often than not very cut and very stepped on. Rarely was there a dealer who actually put really quality shit in a &quot;stamp&quot; bag - and so my experiences here have been towards the larger, wholesale quantities. My entire experience as a heroin user has evolved from hustling (and I mean hustling-read my profile quote) and selling priceless heirlooms to cop a bag or two from a shady street dealer... to having to wait every few weeks just to have the Coin, then waiting further to GET the coin, and then longer waiting to get the order. I enjoy the dope better, it lasts longer, and now that I have the OPTION (because on the street you are certainly limited to a few choices if you&#039;re lucky enough to LIVE in a city with a &quot;street&quot; and not the STYX like I live in now) to not go out and risk all that. Knowing I have some amazing, top quality supreme gear waiting to be shipped out, or hopefully already shipped, is nearly too exciting to bear. I have been fortunate that as I get older, like with alcohol and not getting hungover anymore, I tend to NOT withdrawl if the dope is good. So as much as I want MORE those few weeks until I can order again... Its so much better than the alternative that it can&#039;t begin to compare. Long live SR

				Annnnnnd its &quot;in transit&quot; the two greatest words you&#039;ll hear on SR - except for &quot;in mailbox&quot;<br /><br />On that note, I am speaking about an order with DragonCove. If you are looking for a HQ vendor (now, I can&#039;t &quot;vouch&quot; for his quality, but if you read all the feedback and forum comments (as you should for ANY vendor youre considering spending serious coin on) you can see that his quality is definitely one if not the best on SR. He does not do anything other than Free shipping but even there, not being a fiend and having to make myself wait has more benefits than the alternative. AND this is my birthday pack, so I am so damn excited. I will be one with my mailbox for a few days......

				So my point is, at least here you can (with the help of feedback/reviews) actually gauge what kind of dope you&#039;re getting and how good it is. Can&#039;t ask for more than that!

				Very glad this thread was made. Yesterday I ordered from DieselTherapy (time is right g) and a g from Dragoncove (see ETA). Supremesmoke cancelled a 1g order from me late last night, but I gather he&#039;s wary of new buyers so no hard feelings. <br /><br />I&#039;ll report back with my experiences in a few days (or tomorrow, hopefully!).<br /><br />ETA: So Dragoncove asked me to FE because I have no buyer history. In general, I won&#039;t FE, but DC has such superlative reviews I decided to take a leap of faith. Of course, then I see at the bottom of his feedback that he asked someone else to FE and they got, supposedly, crap gear. Of course, this could be some bullshit, but now I&#039;m stressing. Will def update for the sake of other new customers.

				As a rule of thumb we should never FE - but with no buyer history it&#039;s kind of hard to argue with it. I am waiting for an order from DC myself - and I think you probably just had to FE because of your lack of history. Far as I know, DC is a straight shooter - and you should be looking forward to THAT package (Sorry DT - but I&#039;ve tried the regular heroin and its pretty much comparable to any OK street dope).

I know theres a UK/EU thread that&#039;s pretty popular but I think a lot of people here only want to order from US vendors so... here&#039;s hoping more people will actually post here instead of just reading.........

				i am considering it very much, but where i am from it would not be worth it to, it is very difficult to ship where i am from it isnot as simple as walking into a post office to post something meaning my methods to ship cost money basically, but due to demand and people asking i am trying to work on a 5 gram 10 gram and 20 gram listings just its in test mode as i have no shipped this before mainly prescription medication only but i think to the usa it will be very successful

				Hoping to keep this thread alive.. I know there are noobs out there who can only post here for the time being so hope you guys see this..<br /><br />Anyway I received my order from DragonCove last week, I have been to busy/high for the past week to even review it. Order placed Tues, In Transit Wednesday and received Saturday. Shipping was free so wait was not too bad. Stealth was good.. But as for the product, well I have to say it was the best dope I&#039;ve ever done. It&#039;s as good as Marlo/Carlito&#039;s but I have to say it was even better. Strong acetone taste, totally white, all powder, could cold shoot with no residue left. Would DEFINITELY order again if I have the coin&amp;time. Only have a few orders under my belt and DC was totally cool with my first time order from him. Looking to place an order this weekend, I know I am in a shipping lull as most vendors don&#039;t ship Saturday and even so its getting late so.. Was going to try SupremeSmokes stuff.. It&#039;s the bestselling and seems to be for a reason.. if anyone has tried let me know! Also would be great to hear about other vendor&#039;s quality, such as NowThatsTheStuff.. Keep posting guys!

I know there are noobs out there who can only post here for the time being so hope you guys see this..<br /><br />Anyway I received my order from DragonCove last week, I have been to busy/high for the past week to even review it. Order placed Tues, In Transit Wednesday and received Saturday. Shipping was free so wait was not too bad. Stealth was good.. But as for the product, well I have to say it was the best dope I&#039;ve ever done. It&#039;s as good as Marlo/Carlito&#039;s but I have to say it was even better. Strong acetone taste, totally white, all powder, could cold shoot with no residue left. Would DEFINITELY order again if I have the coin&amp;time. Only have a few orders under my belt and DC was totally cool with my first time order from him. Looking to place an order this weekend, I know I am in a shipping lull as most vendors don&#039;t ship Saturday and even so its getting late so.. Was going to try SupremeSmokes stuff.. It&#039;s the bestselling and seems to be for a reason.. if anyone has tried let me know! Also would be great to hear about other vendor&#039;s quality, such as NowThatsTheStuff.. Keep posting guys!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree; this is one thread that definitely needs to be kept alive! I have an update [i.e since my last post] that pertains to one of your questions. When I posted that I was thinking of trying a new vendor but dithering over the options, I ultimately ended up ordering a G from Supreme Smoke. As a relative SR noob, I was pleased and surprised when my order was accepted with no questions asked - and the good news is, I was very happy with the transaction. Based on SS&#039;s reviews and my single experience to date, I think a lot of the reason that SS has garnered such an impressive reputation has to do with speed and reliability. I got my order FAST; the weight was definitely good [and possibly a little over - note: I did not scale it; that&#039;s an eyeball estimate]. Product quality - hmm...I want to choose my words carefully here as I want to be scrupulously fair. Given many of SS&#039;s reviews and the price per G, I placed my order with high hopes of receiving &quot;fire&quot; quality dope. In reality, the product was of very decent quality; good for insufflation and IV. [Small amount of particulate matter revealed in preparing a heated IV solution but generally pretty clean stuff.] The product was a little bit &quot;creeper&quot; even via IV ROA but it came on nicely given a short wait. So, what does all of that mean? In a nutshell - SS did in fact sell me some of the best H I&#039;ve had on SR to date....in all honesty, however, the quality of the product was not - in my estimation - commensurate with the costly price tag attached to it. <br /><br />All of THAT said: speed and reliability are priceless qualities in a vendor who specializes in this particular product and it seems that SS has gone out of his/her way to elevate professionalism in a business context that often lacks such consideration. Taken altogether, I&#039;m happy to recommend this vendor if you find the price structure acceptable. I personally hope to find one or more vendors who offer product and service that suits my taste for a more attractive price - I&#039;m limited by a rather tight budget at present - but I imagine I will still order from SS from time to time. My limited experience + a vast quantity of reviews suggests and ethical, dedicated, and professional vendor. :-)<br /><br />Update two: At the time of my last post, I had just placed my second order with Deezletime. I addressed all of the &quot;issues&quot; that folks raise about this vendor in my first post so no need to belabor them here. Suffice it to say that I am still perfectly satisfied with this vendor. My second order contained *lots* of freebies which helped to offset light stamps. Deezle is what he/she is - and again, I feel it is to his/her credit that he/she doesn&#039;t pretend to be anything other than what he/she is. If there&#039;s anything I&#039;ve learned during my short tenure with SR, it is that net-purchased H is seriously inflated vis-a-vis street values for weight. We are paying for convenience and security - valuable commodities, I think we would all agree. :-) For this market, DT offers good prices, better quality product than expected for street dope/cost, and seems to fulfill orders reliably. While buying stamps is not cost effective when stealth shipping is involved, I do have to say that I will continue to order with DT when I feel like buying stamps online. <br /><br />Update three: I placed my first order with DieselTherapy on Thursday; priority shipping. It was marked in transit within hours of placing the order...which I am hoping means that I will have my package on Monday...Will update when received.<br /><br />I&#039;m now looking to place another order - still hoping to find that &quot;ideal&quot; vendor where cost + quality of product + reliability = the best value for my personal budget/tastes. I was pleased to read so much positive feedback about DragonCove on this thread; must get around to trying DC. I was glad to hear that you had such a positive experience, BaleAlexander, and thanks for sharing it with us. :-) <br /><br />I&#039;m considering placing an order with mrgood247, a new vendor with excellent feedback [thus far] and attractive prices. Anyone tried that vendor yet?<br />

				The best way to get a order accepted as a noob is to msg the vendor asking if they are willing to do business with you etc before just ordering you will find because of that gesture they will never say no(if you do it right, nice and politely)

				Lol.. nostalgia for a bygone era a century ago before heroin was synthesized.. Right we all remember those days, hmm? Kidding! Opium is nice. But once you try heroin, no sweet smelling/tasting flowers can compare... Glad folks are still posting here. I also would mention that I placed an order with SS last week and it was abruptly cancelled. I assumed he did not like my stats. Which, in that case, I would say FU. At least for keeping my coin tied up, and there is nothing on his vendor page about buyer &quot;prerequisites&quot;. In any case, the opportunity allowed me to order from Subsrgood, and boy am I glad it worked out that way. If any of y&#039;all read the main H thread or any reviews when his product is up, Subs stuff is by far and away some of if not THE best #4H in the US. Also, Subs communication is unlike anything I&#039;ve encountered on SR. If you can afford it, BUY SUBS NOW. So yeah, that&#039;s my 2 BTC. If any of y&#039;all are interested he&#039;s starting next week to sample 100mg of his China White which is supposed to have 96% purity.. So if any of y&#039;all are gunslingers just new to SR you should look out for it.

				So here&#039;s my top H vendors:<br /><br />Subsrgood - Hands down the cream of the crop. The communication was astoundingly good. Too bad more vendors are not more customer-friendly (though I have admiration for the no-frills autopilot-ness of some top vendors i.e. Dragoncove) but the quality here is just (very nearly) peerless. <br /><br />Dragoncove - Didn&#039;t really require any comm. but there is only priority shipping so you have to kind of give it up to USPS if you order from DC but my LORD the quality is spectacular. In my experience, I would wager DC and Subs were within ~5% of each other in purity. But that&#039;s not including Subs china white coming up soon (96%!?!?! droooll...).<br /><br />Marlo/Carlitos - Now that he&#039;s in stealth I can&#039;t say he&#039;ll be back but hey, this vendor is definitely top 3 (and that includes the previous two vendors) in quality &amp; price.<br /><br />That&#039;s it for now. I have tried other vendors but they aren&#039;t really worth writing home (or here) about. If any of these vendors have listings up do NOT hesitate. Also, though, if you are new to using dope please take my personal advice and go slow with anything from these vendors - the quality is leaps and bounds superior than &quot;street&quot; dope. Even with my decent tolerance I blow a little to see where purity is at before I roll up my sleeves.

My reasoning on the matter was pretty straightforward - given the nature of this community, we all necessarily share a few common interests, security and anonymity chief among them. In order to successfully [i.e. safely] transact whatever business brought us to the road, we have to prioritize that caution - and at the practical level, we really don&#039;t have much in the way of reliable information to inform our decisions. Outside of transaction reviews [which might be biased/dishonest/extorted/padded/etc. ad nauseam] and forum &quot;gossip&quot; [which might be...], we just don&#039;t have a lot of substantive information on which to base our dealings with strangers...clandestine dealings, at that. Given such a context, whatever minimal information we can glean about the folks we&#039;re interacting with assumes a heightened significance - first impressions count for perhaps more than usual; how we choose to represent ourselves; how we choose to communicate...all of that stuff matters a great deal when making a bad judgment call potentially engenders seriously costly consequences. To my way of thinking, mannerly behavior and a healthy respect for the golden rule seem like obvious requisites to participating in a community that is essentially self-governed. They&#039;re not bad for being a decent human being, either...<br /><br />You really hit on something, Cryngie. &quot;Nice&quot; and &quot;polite&quot; - unfortunately, seriously undervalued traits in the world. Well, even if some of the more unpleasant types aren&#039;t sold on the social cum philosophical value, maybe they&#039;ll appreciate the mercenary value...sigh. Okie, banish the cynicism - fist bump to you for a solid observation. Your motion is seconded and I&#039;ll even append the proposition that it takes more effort to be a jerk than it does to be pleasant.

				+1 for that eloquent input sic semper tyrannis, even to this day as a established member I still message a potential vendor before placing an order for 2 reasons 1 to be polite as stated by you a often overlooked mannerism, build a rapport with them (weed out the rude and the once that seem dodgy) and 2 to gauge the response time and also time of day they are online as to place an order it doesn&#039;t sit processing for 20hrs, if only more people had manners and took this approach there would never be anyone complaining about orders being cancelled

Actually, SR seems to be packed to the gills with nerds, to its everlasting credit&nbsp; ;) I ran a search and came up with a series - was that what you meant or did you mean an author? The series that popped up was described as a mystery series. I&#039;m a heavy sci-fi/fantasy geek but I&#039;ll read anything. If you like mystery, have you tried the Amelia Peabody series by Elizabeth Peters? Absolutely delightful series. <br /><br />I am supposed to be studying, but quick answer to a question you raised: speedballs. Let me preface my remarks by emphasizing this is a matter of personal opinion [and to some extent, medical savvy]. Speedballs are SCARY. I&#039;ve done them maybe 3 or 4 times altogether in my life and doubt I will ever repeat the experience. The first time I did one was perhaps the third time I&#039;d ever &quot;rolled up my sleeve&quot; in my life and I very clearly and specifically requested a weak mix due to inexperience and caution. I watched it being prepared and it was indeed a very small quantity of each drug - and inside of 10 seconds of doing it, I ran out of the house and ended up on my knees in a mud puddle, puking. In fairness, my body was quite drug naive at the time; however, the risk [medically speaking] of IV-ing C [alone or in a ball] cannot be over-emphasized. Given that I&#039;m sitting here debating the relative merits of heroin dealers - lol - I&#039;m sure it&#039;s obvious that I&#039;m not trying to moralize or demonize the use of hard drugs. Like many of the nerds on the road, I tend toward a libertarian attitude with respect to matters of individual lifestyle choice. That said, I am also a big believer in harm-reduction and education is generally the strongest tool in that arsenal. I hope you will not find it presumptuous if I suggest that researching the topic thoroughly is a very good idea...? Statistically speaking, there is a much greater probability of experiencing a dangerous and/or fatal coronary event IV-ing C or C&amp;H than IV-ing H alone; individual health conditions naturally have a bearing on outcomes. Maybe someone here has more experience than I do...but I can definitely say that to my tastes, at least, speedballs are a waste of good dope. ;-) Take care and stay safe. On another note, should have another vendor update tomorrow or the next day.

				I figured this thread was as a good a place as any for my question. <br /><br />So, without further verbiage - I received an order from a vendor today that was supposed to be H. It didn&#039;t look *quite* right in terms of texture; the vinegar smell was weak. I did the obvious and sampled a small amount - in rails. I didn&#039;t really feel much after 10 minutes but I could feel a little something...nothing in the flavor or perceived effects [such as they were] led me to believe there was anything like rat poison in the product or anything. I let it ride and did other things for awhile - a big concession for me as I would normally have finalized my order immediately after confirming the contents. This time...I wasn&#039;t sure of the contents. When no ill effects resulted after about an hour, I decided to &quot;roll up my sleeves.&quot; Now THAT ROA resulted in strongly perceptible effects...but still not quite like H and the &quot;rush&quot; period was brief. I went on about my life thinking that maybe I just had some really cheap stuff but ended up nodding pretty hard over what I was doing within - maybe 15 minutes? [I have a horrible sense of time.] <br /><br />At the time, I was somewhat reassured by the nodding but perplexed by the perceived differences between this product and my usual expectations of H. Fast forward many hours - I was getting antsy about not finalizing payment but I still harbored doubts about the product so I did a rinse and repeat of the earlier exercise, blew a little followed by a [smaller] booted dose. Same experience, same doubts; there was something familiar about this product but I couldn&#039;t quite pin it down....<br /><br />After some internal debate, I decided to release payment since the turnaround/processing/stealth was all laudable and clearly I had been sold some form of real opioid narcotic. I held off on rating the transaction, though - and took the time to read the discussion associated with the vendor, where I think I found the answer to my mystery: as another reviewer [under &quot;discussions&quot;] at another time suggested, the product seemed like Fentanyl. [Note: I don&#039;t know if that particular reviewer received the same batch as I did.] My question is this: what action, if any, should I take with respect to this transaction? I&#039;m not 100% certain of my conclusions but I am relatively confident that at the very least, the product that was sold to me as H was heavily adulterated with Fentanyl. The reason that is a point of concern should be obvious: the statistics associated with fatal Fentanyl overdoses are truly frightening. I&#039;m not very experienced with that particular substance but I have enough experience and pharm knowledge to be certain that someone preparing an IV solution of Fentanyl to the specifications of their perceived heroin tolerance is risking overdose. The questions in this situation just go on and on...Should I confront the vendor? Does the vendor himself/herself even know? Given the potential for harm, I think I&#039;m justified in naming the vendor in question at this point: my order was for one G of the &quot;regular&quot; dope from Diesel Therapy. If anyone else made the same order in the last few days - and several reviews mentioned the fluffy texture and light/white color that describes what I received - please, please be careful! Fent is MUCH stronger than H....I don&#039;t have any way to get this stuff evaluated in a lab. I&#039;m really worried now; I don&#039;t want anyone to get hurt. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. I think I&#039;ll have to try writing the vendor at least.

				Well Im assuming it was an order with UGS? That&#039;s the only vendor I&#039;ve read that someone claimed they got fentanyl from them.. If it is not them you should definitely not hold it in because of some highfalutin reasons or respect for that vendor.. don&#039;t care what kind of stealth or shipping amazingness there is, selling something other than what you advertise is NOT ok on SR, in fact I&#039;m almost positive on that fact. I will do some research of my own but I definitely think you should not be quiet about it. You&#039;re right about the overdosing possibility, and I sure as hell don&#039;t think its okay to send something different than you wanted.. esp if you could easily OD if you think its what you ordered. This is not one of those &quot;just part of the game&quot; things, everyone should gauge the potency of product first but if its something other than H then how can we do that?

				I tried to write the vendor immediately after posting this question and got kicked out of SR. I spent 1.5 hours trying to log back in and never made it on; indeed, I did not get back onto SR until today - which really bothers me. The only thing salving my conscience in the matter is the hope that some of the folks affected read my post. <br /><br />Thanks for backing me up on this one, Balexander. I agree that vendors need to represent their product accurately and would guess that there are rules on the subject. When I finally got back on tonight, I wrote Diesel Therapy immediately and finalized payment to another vendor...due to the experience with DT, that other vendor waited on receiving my money for nearly a day and a half, poor thing. Suffice it to say that I have learned my lesson about finalizing without careful and complete verification of product. <br /><br />What I don&#039;t like are the ethical ramifications. What if I didn&#039;t get the word out fast enough? What if the vendor was acting maliciously - i.e. with full knowledge of what he/she was doing? What if innocent people got hurt or even died? I told DT that if I didn&#039;t hear back from him/her within a reasonable amount of time that I would go ahead and rate the transaction assuming the worst. If the vendor does not respond appropriately - I think a note on the vendor page about the risk with that product would be a good start - then I will also take the matter to the moderators. I just don&#039;t see any other choice. &quot;The game&quot; is risky enough without admitting unscrupulous people to the playing table. I genuinely hope the vendor was acting in ignorance and not out of malice. This is just a bad situation all the way around. Will update, and again, thanks for the support :-)

				Thanks so much for keeping this thread alive! Definitely helps us newbies. I may just have a review to post here soon, still debating what I&#039;m getting. Trying to stay away from anything too crazy, however I forsee my self-indulgence getting the best of me like it always does. :D

I haven&#039;t read all his comments in a while, but I didn&#039;t read that his was cut with fentanyl (I have read, however,&nbsp; UGS (who is gone) and GotsItAll are cut with F).. I did however have some extra coin last week and ordered a bag of the Blue Diamond. My first order on SR was a G of his Blue Diamond (of course it went on sale as my order was processing!!) and I was pretty satisfied, even at the not-sale price it was better than street dope and was easy on the nose (and not much residue when IVing, either) and was a light reddish-brown color, all powder. The bag I received this week was my second order of BD and it was pretty much white, but it was actually better than the first BD I had tried. I only had enough for the first class shipping, which he specifically states is &quot;no reship, no refund&quot; but I only ordered one so I figured it would be ok. DT had mentioned that he would compensate me for my &quot;loss&quot; as my order of the BD gram last month was in processing as he put it on sale. I reached out to him to remind him of our previous discussion, but, alas, there was just one bag in my order. DT is pretty good about extras, and even though I expected something in tandem with my previous order with him, I did get exactly what I ordered. Since it was first class, it took 7 days from time marked in transit to my mailbox. The quality definitely made up for my greedy expectations. So, I don&#039;t know if this is the batch you think is cut with fentanyl but I would have to say I don&#039;t think it is... In any case I never got responses from messages sent to DT and he never read my messages.. So I am not really sure what to say, actually. I am waiting to see what he says, if anything.

				On a lighter note, Santa came this morning and bestowed upon me a truly wonderful gift from subsrgood. I can&#039;t recommend this vendor enough, the shipping+stealth+quality are absolutely flawless. Got mine within 24 hrs and once again vendor&#039;s communication was far and away the best I&#039;ve encountered on SR. If you ever get a chance to, lord almighty please order from Subs!!

				So I just found UGS with a few bulk listings.. I&#039;d really like to know if anyone&#039;s tried it recently and if/what it may be H/cut wise. I recently placed my first order from Supersun, anyone ordered from them recently?
