I have no idea what&#039;s going on, I&#039;ve tried everything I know to do. Anyone getting through to the site, or is it down at the moment?

				Yea, the site has been down for roughly 3-4 hrs. It had been working fine all day and then as soon as I received my BTC, Boom- Nothing.<br /><br />So I guess we&#039;ll play the waiting game again. I guess it&#039;ll give me more time to stare at my BTC count while on pins and needles at every peak/valley.

				As far as I can tell from what Ive read from reputable sites, they are expecting a crash in the bitcoin price over the next month or so. Could happen at any time. But yes it is quite expensive at the moment, dont know if its worth it to buy right now...unless you are looking to purchase something soon, I dont think the crash will happen in the next few days. I have 3 coins sitting in my wallet that I bought when it was 20 a coin :P dunno what I&#039;m gonna do with it.

				Was kind of entertaining the idea that the site is down on purpose... to prevent vendors from getting ripped off from the super fluctuating bit coins? Eh? Stupid idea?

				meh the speculation about btc surely helps business, it would be in both the vendors and SR&#039;s best interest to keep things running smooth. I&#039;m gonna try during off-hours late tonight.

				Yes, I don&#039;t think they [silk road runners] would bother with closing down their site... sellers should hedge all orders...so when it gets paid out to them they should just trade it quickly on mtgox or wherever :)<br /><br />&lt;3<br />NurseJoy

				I can see the aggravation of BTC inflation if you&#039;re visiting a site that prices per BTC and doesn&#039;t fluctuate with the dollar/pound/euro/whatever, but who cares if you&#039;re a SR user and you&#039;re buying? It&#039;s not like the prices of the products go up, it stays fluctuating with real currency.<br /><br />Maybe I just don&#039;t understand BTC well enough beyond SR and investment, but as far as SR goes, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a big deal about the inflation.

				Well, if you bought 2 BTC a week ago at $45 a coin, then now your 2 BTC are worth about $112 USD vs $90 usd when you originally purchased them.

				I thought it was just me.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that about the Bitcoins.&nbsp; I bought 8 just two weeks ago and they were $30 each!&nbsp; Now I wish I bought more.&nbsp; I just read an article that said that Bitcoins would go up in value as sites like WordPress are now accepting them.&nbsp; The creator of Bitcoins now has a bank backing them and when corporate anything gets involved the consumer always gets screwed!!!&nbsp; Hence, the now $60+ in value!
