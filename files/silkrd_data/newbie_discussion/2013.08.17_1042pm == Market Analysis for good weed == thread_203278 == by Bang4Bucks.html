				Hi, I am Bang4Bucks.<br /><br />First of all, I would like to introduce myself. I am a business man looking for some opportunity on here since I have direct access do several grower and have a long time &#039;&#039;on the street&#039;&#039; experience.<br /><br />I would like to know if the prices I would submit would be good for SR. This is AAA Quality (well cured, dry, nice buds) of a Commercial strain (M39) so I give it a 7/10 aka good weed.<br /><br />All of the prices includes free shipping worldwide.<br /><br />3.5g=35$<br />7.0g=65$<br />14g =115$<br />28g =195$<br /><br />Thanks you for taking your time to read this and possibly responding my request.

				i think those are good prices, but helpful tip, people would rather have 10 grams of regular quality for 100$ than 5 grams of hella dank for 100, so try getting some regular mids and charge it like this<br /><br />5 grams = 0.40<br /><br />10 grams = 0.8<br /><br />20 grams = 1.7<br /><br />and on and on, also offer special deals like UGS does and go with <br /><br />14 grams of mid grade weed 0.8800, i&#039;ve bought it multiple times cause it was an awesome price and the quality was still, very nice even though it was mids

It is AAA quality of a commercial strain, there is a reason why is it commercial... it is GOOD weed. I don&#039;t smoke alot of pot to be honest but Id rather smoke good quality @ 10$/g instead of of HQ Purple Kush @18+$/g that is my take on this.<br /><br />Sure there are some Exotic smoker, hence the market, but Id like to get on the commercial grade market since my connection are better.
