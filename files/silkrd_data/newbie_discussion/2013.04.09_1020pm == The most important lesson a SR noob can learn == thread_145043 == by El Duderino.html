				Long time listener, first time caller, not yet @50. To all noobies (with, or without boobies) live by these two simple rules &amp; your journey on The Road will be as safe as it possibly can be.<br /><br />1) Always use PGP encrypted messaging to send your address<br /><br />2) Don&#039;t Finalize Early (release funds from escrow at the request of the vendor before you have received your product - many require this as a condition of sale before they will actually ship).<br /><br />Ever.<br /><br />Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. <br /><br />Pretty much everything can be sourced from a vendor that will not have Finalizing Early as part of their policy, even if it costs say 20% more that&#039;s less than the potential cost of getting ripped off. The most reputable ones generally actually forbid their customers to FE &amp; it&#039;s there for everyone&#039;s protection. <br /><br />Imagine you were buying stuff in real-life &amp; a trusted dealer you&#039;ve used for months said &quot;hey, this time can you give me the money now &amp; come back tomorrow to collect the gear&quot;? That&#039;s what FE is on SR.<br /><br />Not everyone who asks you to FE is a scammer, but every scammer will ask you to FE.

				FE = Finalize Early = releasing funds prior to receiving your order = BAD!&nbsp; DON&#039;T DO IT!&nbsp; <br /><br />The escrow system is in place for your protection, and as long as you stay in escrow (and do not finalize early) then even if you end up placing an order with a scammer, your money will be safe and recoverable in the resolution center.

				Yes, if a vendor &quot;requires&quot; you to FE, it would be safest to find a different vendor.

				Sorry, I was using this as a slightly non-wasteful spamming thread &amp; just noticed some actual questions.<br /><br />Pretty much everything can be sourced from a vendor that will not have Finalizing Early as part of their policy, even if it costs say 20% more that&#039;s less than the cost of getting ripped off.

				Very true.&nbsp; I FEd a couple times for my first orders, but they were very reputable. I did it once more after a successful transaction and got juked. Im still trying to straighten things out. Its a mix of my stupidity, a lazy and sketchy vendor (i know now hes kinda sketchy) and bad timing. <br /><br />Bottom line is I FEd and now dude has my money and I learned the hard way. Oh and BTC has risen $$160 since I FEd for the guy. Hes making out well but something tells me I will win with enough negative publicity.- which I will be displaying hard soon, once im on the normal message boards and when I confirm I got ripped off. Here soon. That dude has a serious hole in his ass to do something like that.
