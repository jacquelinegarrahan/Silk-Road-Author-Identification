				SR has only existed two and half years. Considering all the threats to its existence, what do people see for the future of the Silk Road?<br /><br />I think this is the prototype for a new way for individuals to interact in society, and as the first attempt, it likely will falter at some point. I hope not, but I don&#039;t think SR specifically will last for 5 more years. But there will be even better systems that take its place.

				I think so. I think that it is a big enough machine now that even if one leg gets cut off,<br />there is many others.

				I hope there is more competition - not just to this site, but alternatives to the Tor network, new encryption algorithms etc.&nbsp; And some significant changes to national and international laws.<br /><br />If we stagnate, we become the low-hanging fruit for LE.

Not even the state. I think at this point it would be very hard to shut down. Its bigger than you or I realize<br />shut one server down, another pops up. With enough redundancy and trusted people who are always adapting with the changes, I think it will remain<br />a landmark in this new world.
