				I always like tripping at night because the streetlights look amazing... The world has this orange look. If you&#039;re just going to be stuck in your house it doesn&#039;t matter but its a nice option to go outside day or night.

				Out of my 300-400 LSD trips in my life, I&#039;d say 85% of them were at night actually.&nbsp; I really enjoy it at night.

				&nbsp; LSD experiences are hard to describe regularly, so I&#039;m going to do it through music examples.&nbsp; &nbsp;Day tripping is pretty colorful and though it is enlightening it has a sort of chillness to it, I would say day tripping is like the grateful dead.&nbsp; Night tripping is more surreal, more mystical, though i&#039;ve experienced less color during my night trips, iti s made up for by having a feeling that I can&#039;t really describe.&nbsp; Night tripping is like Pink Floyd in their most popular albums.&nbsp; &nbsp;Night tripping might be more feeling and sensation based vs day tripping&#039;s more perception and social basis.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Haven&#039;t done LSD in a good few years though, will have to get some again. How is the quality on here, I&#039;m hesitant to order it through mail due to its extreme degradability.<br /><br />&nbsp; PS:&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying day tripping is any less fun or pleasant than day tripping.&nbsp; You&#039;re in for a good time and a great memory.

				I&#039;ve tripped during the day and at night. The main problem with night tripping, is you&#039;re up all night tripping, and it wears off in the morning and you want to sleep, just as the sun is coming up and your body&#039;s rhythm is ready to wake again.&nbsp; The last few times I tripped at night it got my internal clock all mixed up and it took a while to get it normal again.

				I like them both night and day and they are as different as &quot;night and day&quot;. Night has more visuals in the darkness and behind the eyes. But the day lets you see everything and can seem to be more overwhelming at times because you can see so much doing so much!!! LOL. Both are awesome in their own way. Dive in and enjoy both. The above mentioned &quot;morning exhaustion is certainly true and not without merit. I hate the morning crash.

				If your somewhere there is a nice sunset? maybe dose 15 mins before that? I do like late night tripping tho. take a walk down the neighborhood or golf course and the stars are always the best part.

				both are good for different reasons.<br />day - good - can see, walk through gardens and see multi colors of flowers, anything really<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- bad = normal people are awake and can get a bit para(noid)<br />night - good - can walk around and seem like a normal person watch stars, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- bad - can get lost in the dark(ness)

				it&#039;s always a good idea to get familiar with the place before and be sure that there will be little unplanned encounters, unless you&#039;re into it ;)
