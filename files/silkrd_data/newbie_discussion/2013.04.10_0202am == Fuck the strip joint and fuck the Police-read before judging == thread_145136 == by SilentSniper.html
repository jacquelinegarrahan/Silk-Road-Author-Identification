I&#039;m not trying to start anything w/LE because I think your kool.&nbsp; OK Me and and couple people went to the strip joint with 2 8balls tonight.&nbsp; My friend was coked at of his mind pulled out his Id and 1 8ball fell out.&nbsp; COp looked at us for about a min, I really think that fool didnt want to bust us but there was people around so he had no choice.&nbsp; Took us to his car around the corner.&nbsp; Make a long story short. Asked where we got it I said fuckin SR.&nbsp; He laughed and said Ill take these you help people who know what to do this or some shit like that. Looked up are info We have no criminal record.&nbsp; He said hit the rd. I know Le they never want to see me in trouble, maybe they like the way I look or something.&nbsp; I can tell you storys about LE encounters were Ive shouldve went to jail, never did&nbsp; dont ask me why. But please LE what do you make of all this, this is not a BS story. Can you respond pretty quickly because Im leaving soon, just drop some E. Im not trying to funny. Just want to know.. Lemdurci or chaos for piece please help I think your kool man. Not being A dick nothing, but I&#039;m stumped on this.

				That cop was still a thief, he took your shit. You could have dropped&nbsp; &#039;anything&quot;, how did he establish that you possessed Coke?<br />&nbsp;Did your package say &quot;COCAINE&quot; in large Bold Letters on the outside, who is to say your not carrying sweetener around because your a diabetic NutraSweet? <br />&nbsp;I would have looked him in the eye with a straight face and confident attitude and laughed and said Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, it&#039;s NutrSweet. Have a nice day officer.<br />&nbsp;I would have invoked my 4th amendment rights (Terry Vs Ohio) and asked if I was under arrest, because if your not, your are then Constitutionally free to go, (In the United States).<br />&nbsp;The possibility of the officer feeling that he has the right to exercise his power to search citing&nbsp; the plain view doctrine is a relevant question here, still I would ask how he established exactly what the identity of the chemical was simply by glimpsing a package that hit the bar for a second or two?<br />&nbsp;You never give them anything, any information is too much information period. Make them work for their own information,. They usually mess everything up pretty well on their own.<br />&nbsp;Where did I get it from? Well you might find this hard to believe officer, but I got it from the chief of Police =) With a smile, they have a sense of humor, but don&#039;t fucking tell them SR, WTF!!<br />&nbsp;Lastly, I am not LE. I am however a Jailhouse lawyer with a few years of practice and research under my belt.

He obviosuly got really lucky, he had an 8ball and did not go to jail. Whether you think how he acted was wrong or right, in my eyes it was right because he is not currently in jail. Besides, when you start being a dick to cops, they will be a dick to you and a majority of the time they will win that battle. When you start lying to people you fuck yourself harder, trying to tell him its Nutrasweet would be sure to piss him off and land you in jail.

				You know why I think this guy was piised up. Because when somebody goes into a strip joint and all the hos lite up with love and treat him like a celeb because of what he has who cares Im good with that concept. Not because of him because of other things.&nbsp; Now a nigga cant show his face in that motherfucker, its just not eticlal.&nbsp; Always want to feel the love. But I think he aint pissed off anymore, because much more is on the way.. OH yeah forgot to add cane in as strip joint is definent boote gheetin, no promblem, try it sometime, Hos wiil do anything for that shit.&nbsp; You don&#039;t really have to be that good lookin either, but if you are man you the celeb.Oh yead dont forget the E and weed too.&nbsp; Kane is not addictive to me ican stop anymore.&nbsp; But when ho does you got do it.

				The OP said the cops car was &quot;around the corner&quot;, implying the cop didn&#039;t have any video evidence. After going around the corner where no one could see, he could do whatever the hell he wanted.&nbsp; I suppose we&#039;re all human(except those lizard people, jk).&nbsp; Anyone who is breathing is generally looking for a way up, whether by hook or by crook.&nbsp; This stuff happened all the time when I was growing up in the city.&nbsp; More crime and more work stress cops out to the point where they feel they&#039;re owed something and they go rogue.&nbsp; Hell, half the cops in my current town smoke pot.&nbsp; I suppose that&#039;s the law now. :o
