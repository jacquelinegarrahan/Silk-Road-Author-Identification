				Hi to all<br /><br />New to forum and been active on SR for about 6 weeks. I am in UK<br /><br />Placed 15-20 orders with trusted sellers so far and all has gone pretty well to date, until today .....<br /><br />Placed and order with trusted seller from Netherlands, which was totalled about 1.2 BTC for 2 products.<br /><br />I had placed 2 orders with this supplier previously and no issue, infact pretty good all round, hence reordering<br /><br />This was for 2 different products this time and got a little concerned after it seemed longer than previous orders.<br /><br />Anyway, delivered today was a royal mail plastic bag, with just the front of an envelope inside. From markings etc it was clear it was this order.<br /><br />The royal mail plastic bag was printed on the bag and titled - Our sincere apologises and went on to say we are sorry this item has reached you in this condition (your not kidding, not as sorry as me&nbsp; :) )<br /><br />If anything is missing lost etc, do this.......<br /><br />It did say if it was previously with another handler they may not be able to help etc. I can upload a photo of bag if needed but i guess others will have seen before.<br /><br />So, questions and advice if you would be so kind. <br /><br />As it in the royal mail bag, can i assume it was found in netherlands not in UK?<br /><br />Would customs not have written informing me?<br /><br />Can i expect a knock at the door to investigate further or with small amounts do they just leave it there?<br /><br />Once a parcel such as this is found, anyone know what the procedure is?<br /><br />Do they add name, address to a database and can they cross reference outgoing mail or is that just logistically impossible.<br /><br />If found in Netherlands, would Royal mail and/or police be alerted by foreign customs?<br /><br />I have another parcel expected, from Belgium and Germany, expected in next 1-3 days, would that concern<br /><br />I know there are alot of bl##dy questions above though your advice and thoughts would be greatly appreciated and hope to become active on forum<br /><br />Many thanks

				Sometimes mail does get damaged, maybe your stuff fell out on a line somewhere and they really had no way to know what envelope it came out of (which would probably be better than if they did!). In the U.S. I&#039;ve had maybe two pieces of mail ever that came in a bag with that kind of note (but this was waaaayyyy before SR).

				yep, im in u.s. but i&#039;ve gotten a non-sr letter a long time ago that was opened by an unknown asshole postal worker and arrived empty in a bag like that. dick stole my birthday cash from grandma. Since you have the envelope, or at least the addressed part, there&#039;s no way for them to know where the contents came from if found.<br /><br />so the bad news is you lost that order. maybe message the vendor with photo of bag to see if he&#039;s sympathetic. but the good news is you&#039;ll almost certainly get the next one, and you&#039;re not at all fucked. And that is really great news.

				So are saying it was unluncky and customs did not find and just confiscate? <br /><br />How sure in % are you that police / customs have not associated with me?<br /><br />It was kind of a flimsy envelope but there was a small area size of a 10 p which looked like dye, did wonder if it was a test placed on envelope to test for drugs it was a light pinky to blue kind of colour i think, without going to look again.<br /><br />Would i have had a letter from netherlands customs if found there or a letter from UK if found there?<br /><br />I have contacted supplier with photo as suggested.<br /><br />Would you be worried about deliveries coming soon from 2 other EU countries from recognised good sellers on SR?<br /><br />Thanks for advice, its appreciated<br />

				I believe this is a Royal Mail fuck up, nothing to do with Customs., so i wouldn&#039;t be too paranoid about the next two deliveries clearing customs as for what the royal mail has found, who knows, all we can do is speculate, to be safe best thing you can do is just clear the address of drugs/ paraphernalia. And get another delivery address. <br /><br />Would be interested to see how this turn out, you should update the thread when you packages arrive/ confiscation letters.<br /><br />Also i would be interested to here your method on obtaining bitcoin in the UK, if possible could you PM me.

				Thanks, suppose we will see over next few days.<br /><br />Deny everything. <br /><br />Not sure how to go about a new delivery address.<br /><br />Will certainly update this thread.<br /><br />Would you risk a resend to same address and name from same supplier?<br /><br />Will PM you where i get BTC in UK from<br /><br />Would be pleased to hear others thoughts before the next couple of days approach, as still nervous<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				Good news touch wood&nbsp; :)<br /><br />2 parcels arrived today, 1 domestic 1 EU belgium.<br /><br />If the next arrives tommorow that is all here safe and sound and the NL one seems as if it could be a combination of poor packaging and rough sorting machines. I hope i have not been lulled in to a false sense of security, comments pls<br /><br />If i ask supplier for refund does that affect my stats badly, will it be on there? <br /><br />Supplier normally asks for FE i had done previously twice, but hadn&#039;t this time, so it is still sat in account waiting to finalise<br /><br />He has seemed he would be open to refund after supplying info and photos.<br /><br />His profile says he does do reships but would this not be a bit daft?<br /><br />Advice on how to proceed with this would be helpful<br /><br />Think i will stay domestic for sometime now<br /><br />thanks<br />

				You should be safe. That was an error in the sorting, it had nothing to do with customs.<br /><br />I think you got lucky this time. As others have said probably they couldn&#039;t tie the content with your letter with 100% certainty and this has removed you from trouble.<br /><br />Tell the vendor to be more attentive on the packaging next time, however. Probably he created a shipment that doesn&#039;t bend fully at 90 degrees (or there are in the inside things that can shred the envelope, this is even worse) and this can cause a block in the sorting machines that can, in turn, bring the buyer to trouble.

				I have had a similar envelope to the one you describe, machines killed the letter.<br /><br />If you want to be 100% sure you are safe then stop ordering for a while, at least a month. Or find a new drop address, or try a drop box. I@m unsure about the boxes though as you can&#039;t deny you ordered anything when you are rocking up to pick it up from a locker. If you are ordering large amounts, the kind that can get you into trouble I would be extremely wary at this point.<br /><br />You may still get a customs loveletter in the post but I don&#039;t know anything about the time frame of these things.<br /><br />Someone in the chain who handles your mail may be onto the fact you receive SR goodies so I would be cautious. Many postal workers are genuine and decent but many rip off mail all the time. I&#039;m lucky where I live atm, most stuff seems to get thro (touch wood) as long as I get to it before my neighbours!&nbsp; Where I used to live, envelopes were opened or checked (corners ripped) all the time.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to you, do you want to play it 100% safe? Or just 75% safe?<br /><br />Good luck.<br />
