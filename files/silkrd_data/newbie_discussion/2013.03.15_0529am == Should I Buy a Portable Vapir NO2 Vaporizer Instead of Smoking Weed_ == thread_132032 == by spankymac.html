				I&#039;m not a heavy weed smoker I usually smoke part of a bowl maybe a couple times a week to relax. So I&#039;m thinking of buying a portable vaporizer, because I hate the coughing and flem, plus it seems a much healthier option to the smoking its self. I was wondering what the difference in effects with vaping instead of smoking. Do sativas still feel like sativas(less couch lock and more energetic)? Sativas are my favorite, because I still feel like I can be productive through out the day. Also is there less of a smell with vaping and could you get away with vaping inside the house when your significant other notices when ever you smoke inside? All your feedback would be much appreciated!!

				i can only speak from experience with the volcano<br /><br /><br />more thc content is released by vaping.&nbsp; ive seen guys who would hit a bong multiple times and be ok, to taking half a bag (1/16 to 1/8 gram) and be locked on the couch.&nbsp; this was a indica however sativa is not very popular where i am.<br /><br />the smell is there but it is less distinct, almost unweed like.&nbsp; it is more controlled with the volcano since it uses bags and u have a valve.&nbsp; i am not familiar with the device you are talking about.&nbsp; it is a cost saver tho.&nbsp; cut weed usage in half if not more.&nbsp; i did the math and in 4-5months paid for itself and it was a $500 unit.<br /><br />with the quality vaprozies you get vapor-poo which is weed with barely any thc left.&nbsp; put this in a bottle of your favorite liquor and u have a body tonic for aches n pains(more so for indicas)<br /><br />

				I&#039;d say only do it if you are a heavy weed smoker. But according to you, you&#039;re not.. so..

In addition it you want to avoid the significant other making comments just consider exhaling into a &quot;device&quot; to hide the smell. Ghetto versions are easy aka a plastic water bottle filled with dryer sheets. A more sophisticated version would be through a roll of wrapping paper with activated charcoal/paper towels/ whatever the fuck you want. Really it isn&#039;t hard to hide the smell just put a little thought into it and don&#039;t let smoke settle around your clothes.<br /><br />Also if you don&#039;t like smoking consider edibles or THC pills which I&#039;ve seen a couple vendors offering. Edibles are awesome!
