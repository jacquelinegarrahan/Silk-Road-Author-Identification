				Wow, all I can say is wow. When they say this stuff hurts like hell they absolutely mean it. The first test involved making burns on my arm with a lit incense stick, then letting a few drops of the venom get into the burns. I did three burn spots for the first attempt, which I read is the starting dose, made sure to get quite a bit of the venom on each burn. I felt it within seconds of applying it to the last burn. Extreme vasodilation combined with unbearable pain, it wasnt anything like a hot pepper it was more like getting ripped apart. Vomitted repeadedly which is common and the desired effect. <br />&nbsp;<br />I felt as if I was going to die, but I still had some wherewithal and knew thats a typical effect and death is extremely rare, I am happy I did my research though because if I didnt know what was happening I would have freaked out, my face started to swell a bit but thats also common, and is infact desired.It was coming at me so fast, my pulse just kept going higher and higher and I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. That effect is very similar to doing a popper (amyl nitrate) and is caused by vasodilation.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought my heart could explode at any moment, faster and faster it went, until I passed out briefly for a few seconds, It felt like I was falling into some sort of void when I went out. Vasodilation caused the passing out by dropping blood pressure.When I awoke it was calming down and my body functions started to return to normal. The afterglow was immediately present, I am now hyperfocused, energized, and confident, with no sign of the afterglow wearing off.<br />&nbsp;<br />I feel alive, if you have ever seen the movie limitless its kind of like what I imagine NZT would be, I just feel...really sharp yet calm (nothing like a stimulant), not exactly like an opiate but I dont feel the burns as bad as I did before applying it. I definately see the medicinal effect no doubt, and despite the initial fear and pain I will be working with this one farther, its definately worth it in every aspect.<br />&nbsp;<br />I dont think you could feel this good without the pain, surely the painful effects keep it from being a drug of abuse, I feel they are necessary.Its an ordeal, definately not a recreational drug, dont take this lightly but I do suggest it, while it isnt a psychedelic and doesnt really produce visuals it does put your body and mind through the ringer like one, your body actually much worse. Its a heavy body load. Something tells me it would go great with woodrose or MG seeds, The woodrose would reduce the extreme vasodilation, and the Kambo would elminate the vasoconstriction caused by woodrose, The two would potentiate eachother while cancelling out alot of the negatives.<br /><br />This is one thing we need to have on the silk road....

				Nice trip report! Who did you order it from? I remember I saw a vendor with a lot of other exotic natural drugs but can&#039;t remember who he is.. That drug definitely seems pretty intense!

				If you&#039;re looking for it on SR contact the seller &quot;Yeshua&quot;. <br />His english isn&#039;t great, but he has the sticks.

				There I found it, it&#039;s from Yeshua : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4660a9f24d&nbsp; not cheap!<br /><br />So how did you apply the burns? I read it leaves a scar and hurts to do that. Do you just put the burning incense on your skin or is there something special to do?

				Yup just put the smoldering incense stick on your skin and burn. Its more effective to apply to meridian points but this was just a first time test dose.<br />Wow, didnt think they would have the sticks on the road. They have everything here lol.
