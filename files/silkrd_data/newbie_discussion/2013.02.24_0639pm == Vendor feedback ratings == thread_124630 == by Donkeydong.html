				So I&#039;m looking at a vendors reviews and had to laugh at these. Need a better rating system or better reviewers lol. <br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took 11 days to get here. 7 grams weighed out .75 short. &quot;Average quality&quot; is very poor quality shwag. Lots of stems and seeds.<br />Worst seller yet. Will never buy from again... <br />-------------------5 of 5 Worst ever but worth a 5--------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor quality but good smoke<br /><br />------------------5 of 5 Babble!-------------------------<br /><br />3 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What irks me most on SR is getting a refund. I didn&#039;t order a refund! monday order was placed and wednesday vendor said &quot;sorry man just checked my stash and don&#039;t have enough to fill a 7g order, wait 2 days if you want&quot; but still had oz.&#039;s listed for sale on his page. He did keep up communication though. <br /><br />---------------3 of 5 -------------------<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as promised :) <br />even though the weed was of a strange good quality for the price..<br />It did not look like what I ordered but I expected that<br /><br />---------------5 of 5 what u talkin about willis I have no idea what this means---------------------<br /><br />5 of 5&nbsp; it didn&#039;t get me super high at first but I packed a bong and it hit around 35 times I kid you not lol<br />still for sending me 14 grams instead of 28 you get a 3 star rating<br />I might order again in the future though<br /><br />------------5 of 5 no high from weed and shorted half weight but you might order again WTF---------------------------

				You&#039;re right.&nbsp; It is kind of screwed up.&nbsp; But it is what it is.&nbsp; Since the default rating that is pre-checked when you finalize an order is a 5, it&#039;s gotten to be pretty much customary for buyers to give five ratings.&nbsp; As a vendor, I can telll you that because of the easy grading system here on SR, a 4 rating is noticed and really can hurt a vendor.&nbsp; I recently had someone give me a 4 because my weed didn&#039;t smell like skunk and he thought all strong weeed was supposed to smell skunky.&nbsp; I&#039;m still answering questions almost daily from customers wondering what happened to my perfect (100) rating.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost like I have an STD or something.&nbsp; If you give a vendor any rating besides a 5, expect some push back.<br /><br />So you really do need to go through and read the actual feedback comments to really get a sense of the vendors.&nbsp; The feedback scores are pretty much meaningless.when the majority of vendors have (100) scores.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s a twisted system, but it is what it is and you won&#039;t make friends trying to change the grading system to a more realistic one.<br /><br />Jack
