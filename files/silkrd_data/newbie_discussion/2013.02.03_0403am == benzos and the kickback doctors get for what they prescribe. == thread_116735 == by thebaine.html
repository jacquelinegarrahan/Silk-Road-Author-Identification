				I&#039;m looking for a decent benzo vendor for clonazepam 2mg.&nbsp; If theirs a canadian vendor thatd be great.<br /><br />i&#039;m so sick of my doc giving me terrible paxil pills with terrible side effects when all i need is a few benzos a day. when i ask for them i either get the addict treatment for specifically asking for them or i get a prescription for 5 pills.&nbsp; What happened. A year ago doctors were handing them out like candy.&nbsp; Now your lucky to get 5 pills?&nbsp; Thank god for SR. Thats all I got to say&nbsp; on that.<br /><br />I think doctors are prescribing ssri&#039;s instead of benzos now because if they prescribe enough brand name paxil and zoloft they get a all paid cruise to the bahamas for &quot;work related&quot; stuff like a one hour conference on anxiety disorders.<br /><br />I think it was the same up into the 90&#039;s with benzo&#039;s. but now the patents are up and generics pretty much rule the market benzo wise.<br /><br />Look at oxycontin. Look what they&#039;ve done to ensure there the only company with longlasting oxycodone.&nbsp; They&#039;ve swindled and fucked the american ppl. from the addict right up to the tax payer. In canada right when oxycontins patent was about to expire Health Canada &quot;suddenly&quot; appoves oxyNEO. a non abusive form of oxycontin, extending the monopoly on that. Fuckers.&nbsp; Atleast now i can get what i need when i need it here at sr.<br /><br />Tell me what you think of the situations at hand. :-\<br />

				I don&#039;t think there&#039;s been a massive shift in benzo prescribing. They&#039;re still broadly prescribed - go look at national frequencies/units prescribed. If you&#039;ve been getting them a long time, maybe they don&#039;t want to keep prescribing them because there&#039;s not good evidence that they&#039;re appropriate monotherapy for long term use and/or you&#039;ve reached their comfort threshold. Maybe your province has a better controlled substance database or something now. Maybe the information about risk for dementia with long term use is spreading through the community, I think that might have made some larger publications.&nbsp; Maybe your OD rate in your area is unacceptable or your docs all work hospital hours too. I can think of a ton of reasons... <br /><br />It&#039;s easy as hell to keep a patient in treatment for YEARS with chronic benzodiazepines because, well, they&#039;ll keep coming back - it&#039;s a much better financial deal for the prescriber - but it&#039;s not always in the patient&#039;s best interest.&nbsp; Your logic here is flawed. A doc could just see you and auto-prescribe the benzos for a short period and have you keep returning, you&#039;d be an established patient, it&#039;s MUCH easier for them and it would be a better financial bet than the cruise (that they&#039;re not getting anyway.) You&#039;d be happy and shut up and go away, after all. They&#039;re not doing that for a reason.&nbsp; Maybe they in fact don&#039;t think it&#039;s the right treatment for you, maybe they&#039;re mean, maybe they&#039;re just addiction-phobic, maybe you need a better specialist - I have no idea. <br />The docs I know take the time to do it right, and sometimes they rx benzos and sometimes they don&#039;t - but they don&#039;t prescribe benzos to make people shush up and go away, they genuinely worry about addiction, and they do prescribe them short term when they think they&#039;re necessary. Sometimes even long term.<br /><br />But they are NOT declining benzos because they&#039;re pimping Paxil. Essentially all the SSRIs are now generic. Most of the antidepressants that are also anxiolytics are now generic. I&#039;ve been kicking drug reps out of hospitals and clinics for a long time. Even at the worst situations I&#039;ve seen, no one was getting a cruise to the Bahamas for a 1 hour anxiety disorder lecture. There&#039;s not a kickback of some dollar amount per prescription. It&#039;s more subtle and insidious than that - go read Danny Carlat&#039;s book Unhinged if you really want to know more about this, it&#039;s an outstanding book. His blog is good too.&nbsp; <br />At this point in time, your typical community FP is not getting a whole lot of anything from their drug rep beyond maybe samples and a cheapie lunch. Maybe Canada&#039;s different. <br />THAT would be a conversation starter with your doctor, though... ask if she&#039;s read the Carlat book. Ha.<br /><br />What does your doctor say when you ask her why she doesn&#039;t prescribe the clonazepam?<br /><br />Anyway, it looks like you&#039;ve found the solution you were looking for.
