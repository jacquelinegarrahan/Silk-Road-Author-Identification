				About 2 months ago I ordered 2 grams of methylone from drzheng and promised him I&#039;d write a review.<br /><br />It took so long because I have never tried M1 before and I usually like a good stretch of free time before I try out a new drug.<br /><br />I have to say this is definetly not something that experienced festie kids or ravers are likely to eat up, but for the price i think it is a pretty good buy.<br />I ingested 50 mg with a friend around 9. I could feel the come up effects within a minute but they seemed to develope slower than say molly. After an hour I felt as though they were fully developed and I was in a very serene state with only slight stimulation and more in a mood to sit and chill. Had I been at a club I dont think Id of been in the mood to dance. <br /><br />My buddy and me decide to weigh out 50mg bumpers&nbsp; and each do another. This bump definetly upped the bliss and also made me feel a little vasoconstriction, nothing to bad but worth mentioning. The two of us putt on some lighter trance and just chilled on X youd normally be talk eachotheres ears off with &quot;I love you mans&quot; and constant hugs. This blissful state was more of a content &quot;I just love being alive&quot; feeling. another hour later we redosed another 50 mg to extend the feeling.<br /><br />I could definetly tell when the comedown started but the whole process was lond so I didnt feel the need to redose again since this experiment to place at my friends apartment. It might be more of a party drug mixed with alcohol or something but after doing X so much I dont think this would be a up to par. That being said I think M1 would be fun with some friends around a camp fire and for the price ( 2g/$40) its as cheap as drinking.<br /><br />As far as the vendor goes:<br /><br />communication- always kept me updated 5/5 <br /><br />shipping and handling - shipped fast and cheep, 5/5<br /><br />stealth - hand written address which still didnt look out of place with the rest of my mail so It didnt bother me, but there were not enough buffer layers <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and you could feel the moonrocks when you held it, (this was months ago and I here drzheng has fixed this) 3/5 <br /><br />product quality - looked great but like i said I have no pryer experience buying, if i had to describe it I&#039;d say it looked like like a more transucent white <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;molly. Also it was about 85% rocks 5/5<br /><br />descriptions - got exactly what listing described 5/5<br /><br />all in all I feel like I got plenty of bang for my buck for 5 bucks worth made for a fun and interesting night.<br /><br />
