				It was definitely a good day to buy! Hopefully others had the sense to spend a good deal once it started to crash and SR was still valuing them around the $240 range.

				I&#039;m spending my whole pay check on Thursday on coins.&nbsp; <br />Last week I doubled it.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the risk for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try again this week.&nbsp; I bet it goes even higher next round. <br /><br /><br />Druggies here should be rich tycoons by now.&nbsp; Or just really high, either one.&nbsp; :-). I&#039;m a little of both.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Lucky Lucky Lucky. I aev been cashing my coins regularly since they reached $100. So luckily my losses are not as bad as they could have been. Problem is that i had $900 in coins before bed, and around $550 when i woke up. Interested to see how low they go.<br /><br />Dimitry

				I only had 50 bucks in my account when they started to rise.Maynard to get away with turning it into 80 and buying a bigger amount. But then my order was canceled and I ended up with only about 50 bucks anyways which I used to buy a smaller amount. :(

				I&#039;m thinking of trying to make some money whenever I get some bitcoin next, last time I made about $10, but it isn&#039;t much seeing as I probably paid more than that in exchange rates.

				I sometimes think about the Bitcoins I spent on drugs. If I had kept them and then sold them at their height I&#039;d have a lot of money.

				I feel like bragging about how much money I&#039;ve made in bitcoins recently would be disrespectful to those who lost, but yea, the rise and falls treated me well.
