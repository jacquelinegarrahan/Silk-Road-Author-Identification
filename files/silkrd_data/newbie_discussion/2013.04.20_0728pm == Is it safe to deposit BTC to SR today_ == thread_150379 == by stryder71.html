				I&#039;m very frustrated with the site today, really want to get n order in after a fantastic experience the other day but the site is loading REALLY slowly and there&#039;s not much information about this on the forums. DPR has kept us up to date with the maintenance and acknowledges the slow loading of the site (which is all appreciated) but there&#039;s been no update for several hours and I was hoping it would be fixed by now. I can barely reach the page I&#039;m looking for!<br />To top this off I&#039;ve seen many people posting about coins not reaching the account after many confirmations. Are these coins turning up yet? Is our security protected at the moment or breached or what?<br />Does anybody know anything more cuz I&#039;m really frustrated and just want things to get moving again so I can transfer my coins (confiddently) and get my order in.<br /><br />Thanks

				The coin transfers are just severely delayed, but, yes, people are receiving them eventually.

				That&#039;s good news, thank you. Now to tread very slowly towards the page I want so I can check the price, so far it&#039;s taken nearly an hour to load 3 pages :/
