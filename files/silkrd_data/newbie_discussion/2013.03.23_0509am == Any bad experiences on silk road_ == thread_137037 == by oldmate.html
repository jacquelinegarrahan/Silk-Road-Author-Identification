				I&#039;ve been dicked over and lied to more face to face buying drugs than on SR.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only been a member 5 months and I&#039;ve bought mostly MDMA but also Ketamine, Cocaine ... and... oh yeah oxy&#039;s... Every transaction has been so smooth. For the most part everybody I wrote with questions responded as best they could.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only used sellers with a rating of 100 and I&#039;ve NEVER EVER Finalized EARLY :( :( <br /><br />Most shit on here is priced to use not sell.&nbsp; The only thing I&#039;ve neen to make money off is the MDMA and also some random pain killers that have a niche market... Some of the older school people are still processing the fact that there&#039;s shit this good (yes the domestic molly on here is AWESOME)... I want to find whoever started selling methylone as MDMA&nbsp; or whomever is to blaim for it being sold as MDMA to these younger college kids who don&#039;t know any better. Its so fucked up.&nbsp; That being said I went a music fest 2-3 years ago and not one hippie had a damn test kit... That just boggled my mind. <br />

				One bad experience. In a nutshell: I waited and waited, order never came, vendor never replied to messages (neither before, during nor after transaction.) Had to go to resolution center where an admin gave me a full refund. Whole process took nearly a month with my money sitting in escrow limbo. <br /><br />I took it as a lesson though, and this goes for everyone, to generate communication with vendor and read all reviews in the FORUMS, not just on the vendor&#039;s page. The vendor feedback can apparently be faked easily, and vendors will do a lot to get a 5/5, so some of those positive reviews may have been bad situations made right, which only sounds bad when you look at it as a vendor buying back high ratings. The forums will give you the honest info, and had I looked, I would have seen that this vendor in particular of formerly high reputation had been falling off and getting shady lately. So, always do your homework, kids!<br /><br />And if you are dissatisfied with a purchase, keep your head cool and kill them with kindness, but DO NOT finalize -- take it to the resolution center where you can succinctly explain your opinion and hopefully strike a deal as a partial or full refund, or extend the due date so it doesn&#039;t auto-finalize. If you don&#039;t work anything out with the vendor, an admin will step in and make the final call, and they are very fair about it (from my one experience). Also, post your issue in the customer support forum. That&#039;s where I learned all this. The mods take good care of customers. :)<br /><br />I guess I rambled a bit, but everyone should know this stuff! I only learned it on the fly, and I was lucky everything worked out. As for the vendor, he doesn&#039;t have any listings anymore and I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be seeing him anytime soon, for better or worse.
