				Not sure why he wouldn&#039;t be responding, but I had a similar situation with him a few weeks ago. He asked me politely to FE after I ordered, I did, and about 13 days later the product showed up. Just wait a few more days, he&#039;s a pretty reliable guy from what I hear.

				I made an order of 1g of mdma 9 days ago and he left me this message: <br /><br />Hey there man , Wanted to thank you for your order first of all ,<br />I was wondering if you could finalize early on your order , As i am restocking soon and bitcoin has been jumping up and down by few dollars everyday and its getting unbeliveable already and i feel its effecting me, and as i have to prepare to restock soon it would be of great help , I will remmember the fact you helped on your next order and will happily include a bonus of your choice free of charge , your order was shipped the day it was put in transit - So you can consider it shipped already !<br /><br />Thank you for understanding ;)<br /><br />So i FE&#039;d, it hasnt arrived yet and he hasn&#039;t replied to my message.

				Another lesson in why FE is dangerous.....After you click that button there&#039;s no chance of refund/SR involvement&nbsp; and all you&#039;re left with is the goodwill of the vendor. Remember that feedback can be faked and scammers will falsify hundreds of transactions to put your coin in their pocket

				Ok so it seems that a situation is getting really serious with him. I dont have my order neither.I ordered an express delivery and still nothing, I would be rally patient but I am really afraid now, after reading these stories and peoples feedback that something wrong is happening here. He doesnt respond to messages, asks for FE, then nothing is sent. I really want to believe that the situation is just temporary. I have never FE, but it will finally auto FE. What to do to not lose so much money ? :( Maybe Heisenberg would kindly explain? I really want to believe that all is good guys

				neuronirvana, are you talking about heisenberg, HeisenbergWholesale, or Haizenberg? They are different SR users. Sorry for being anal. (unless you like that?)<br /><br />I wonder, if haizenberg ran out of supplies around when I ordered (july23ish) and told us all to finalize so he could resupply. Then he shipped them all after he resupplied so now we have massive delays. <br /><br />He was definitely MIA last weekend while everyone (myself included) was panicking but he gave an explanation on his profile and answered messages when he got back.<br /><br />People scream SCAMMER SCAMMER all the time but it is just confusing and counterproductive if you don&#039;t take some time to think and research first. I have seen a lot of stories of &quot;my package didn&#039;t arrive in 2 weeks and haizenberg didn&#039;t answer within 30 seconds!!!!&quot; but not many &quot;my package didn&#039;t arrive AND haizenberg did not resolve satisfactorily.&quot; <br /><br />I HAVE however seen several stories of &quot;haizenberg reshipped and it came (sometimes with extras).&quot; Whether or not any or all of these stories are true I cannot determine. <br /><br />Remain skeptical, my friends.

				Heehe I dont mind your comments Science.H. logic :) It is Haizenberg that I meant. I understand massive problems he could have but also people worried about their money especially when someone doesnt respond. However if he is so trusted vendor I want to believe it will all end up luckily with all of waiting people left satisfied. I will update once I get my stuff :)

				Getting a bit worried about Haizenberg as well, I&#039;ve been a regular for some months now and exchanged words with him from time to time. I never had any issues with any delivery or product (everything A+) until the latest order I did that have yet to arrive 2 weeks and counting. He did mention something about having a hard time to restock and asked for FE&#039;s, so I&#039;m beeing a bit skeptic now as well wheter he&#039;s bailing out of the bussiness or just had a bit of struggle in resupplying. Time will tell. My experience with him before has always been great at least and hope he&#039;ll come back and restore our faith. ;)

				After 26 days Haizenberg messaged me and asked if I wanted a reship or a refund. I was going to wait till 30 but it&#039;s probably not coming at this point anyway. I picked reship because I want to try his legendary products! I will update eventually but for now I think it will work out.

				Make sure you look at all of you mail. Look very closely at every single piece otherwise you could throw way a very important package from Haizenberg without even knowing it. And that would be just so sad because everything I have gotten from Haizenberg has been great product, fast shipping, and perfect stealth.&nbsp; &nbsp;
