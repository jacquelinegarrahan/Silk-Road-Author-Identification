				Hey gang - Just dropping in to make my damn 50 post quota so i can contribute to this community. I deleted my initial forum account because I was ignorantly unaware I needed to have 50 posts in order to post in the other threads.. WTF???. Anyways....<br /><br />I&#039;ve been involved with SR since the VERY early days. In fact my acct is #100 something - this was back 2 yrs year ago when you could still see peoples account # on a chronological scale. I&#039;m surprised I was one of the very first few adventurers to discover this wondrous world, This was back when TFM was a success and OVDB was doing its thing and operating greatly. <br /><br />I also remember the ole captain himself selling Shrromies, &amp; myself being offered them for free on the main SR site, but I (stupidly) declined it because I was skeptical of this new system - but that&#039;s an interesting thing of itself :0.<br /><br />I remember investing $20 in bitcoin when it was selling below the dollar value. Boy, how things have changed.<br /><br />Anyways - hello everyone &amp; excellent job DPR thus far on this SR expedition. Best to you!<br /><br />
