				for the bitcoins to be deposited into my account. I know it may take a min but I worry easly. Blockchain wallet said unconfirmed transaction for a little bit. Now it says confirmed but there is nothing in my account still. Hhmmm.

				Is it normal to have it say confirmed on one end but on the other there is still nothing showing? I don&#039;t recall it being this slow last time with blockchain.

				Yes it&#039;s normal, I think SR wants to see six confirmations in the blockchain, I think that&#039;s why it takes a few hours normally. As long as you got your SR address right it&#039;ll get there eventually.

				It normally takes a couple hours for the coins to get into your wallet. Just today, I placed an order with Blue Sky Traders around 10, deposited the money around 11, and it was in my wallet by the time I got home around 2.<br /><br />Patience ;D

				I had a similar episode with my first deposit.I pushed send on block chain and &quot;poof!&quot;.&nbsp; $200 disappeared. Went to SR account and nothing.....after an hour I discovered a thread like this one and put mymind at ease. An hour later iI had made my first SR purchase.

				Yeah my first time doing it was pretty nerve-wracking. But for me it usually only takes abt an hour. maybe 2. Just depends on the bitcoin network I suppose. Just gotta be patient &amp; wait for the confirmations to come thru in time.
