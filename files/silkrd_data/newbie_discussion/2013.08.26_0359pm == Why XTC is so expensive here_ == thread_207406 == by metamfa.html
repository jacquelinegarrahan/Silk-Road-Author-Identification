				If you buy raw MDMA and a set of milligram scales and some empty capsules it is much cheaper. Plus you get the advantage of choosing your own dose and knowing exactly what your taking.<br /><br />If you like pure MDMA you can do that, if you like something else in there you can mix to your own tastes.<br />

				Pills on SR are likely better quality than those on the street. <br /><br />Stuff on the street from my experience is usually pretty bad unless it&#039;s quite expensive and even then it&#039;s still a rip off compared to MDMA. <br /><br />Just doesn&#039;t seem to be that popular either, considering MDMA tends to be good quality, clean and pretty cheap.<br /><br />But yeah it really changes dramatically by town, city, region, country etc

				i think its all depends on the currency because some1 said that he pays 8-10euro for a pill, and in lithuania we pay 10Lit for a pill and its about 2.85euro. 1euro - 3.50Lit, so maybe thats why its cheaper in Lithuania than Euro and Pound countries. Sound like paradise for you yea :D?

				I&#039;ve lived in a few places, and in all of them the general range of ecstasy pricing is 10-25 USD. Unless you buy bulk. Now this all obviously depended on a multitude of factors. I could score some for 10 a piece, or end up getting stuck throwing down 25 bucks at a rave. Like farmer said, supply and demand. At the actual destination (rave, music festival, etc) everyone is looking to score some beans asap, so cost can be raised accordingly to meet the short supply on hand.<br /><br />To be honest though I can&#039;t complain about SR prices. Especially European vendors. Some of their stuff is dirt cheap compared to local prices anywhere I&#039;ve ever lived.

				Well, from a consumer&#039;s standpoint, (at least in my neck of the woods) it isn&#039;t that much more expensive. Where I am, X goes for about $10 a pill, and it isn&#039;t anywhere NEAR the quality of the $11-$12 pills you can find here on the road. What annoys me is the vendors that offer XTC pills for $5-$6 dollars, but then charge over $15 for fucking shipping. But some vendors do have relatively cheap X, about the street price, but not anywhere near the cheap, shitty quality of street X.<br /><br />Now, from a dealer&#039;s standpoint, yes, this is very annoying. There aren&#039;t too many vendors that offer XTC cheap enough to flip for a decent price, at least in quantities under 100x pills. I&#039;m currently looking for some good, cheap X here on SR that I&#039;ll be able to flip locally. If anyone knows a vendor like this, please let me know. One vendor (I believe his name is Quasari, or something to that effect), is offering pure MDMA XTC pills for $8 a pop, with free shipping, but has since made shipping unavaliable to my country. -.-

				There seem to be a lot of questions of this nature being asked by newbs, and in every case the answer is the same. SR isn&#039;t some overstock discount drugs warehouse; with a product like MDMA of which there is a finite amount of precursor and a huge demand there isn&#039;t any incentive to let it go cheap. There is a minimum cost to the vendors and shipping the stuff into the wild blue yonder to god knows who (essentially upfront) adds to the risk and end cost of product. Even given that, pills are not any more expensive here than irl on average, considering the quality is more consistent, and you can at least rely on some feedback whereas on the street you have to take someone&#039;s word. There are bulk deals on here for less than 5 a pill, granted in large quantities, same as you would encounter anywhere. Who is going to sell you pills for less than 10 without buying in bulk, not worth their time if they sell 1000&#039;s a week. As far as making money, I frequently see people pay 20$ or more gladly for hq rolls, so it&#039;s all about selling in the right places. Like has been said E is a drug that begs to be sold in certain situations like festivals where everyone needs your product immediately and there is a lot less supply. There really aren&#039;t that many habitual users of this stuff who want it all the time like with coke.

				Buy (and test the powder yourself) then make up caps. Weight for weight powder vs pills = better band for ya buck. And some bloke selling pills in a pub doesn&#039;t have to worry about their feedback stats like SR so you think you&#039;re getting uncut/the best product? Get what ya pay for IMO.
