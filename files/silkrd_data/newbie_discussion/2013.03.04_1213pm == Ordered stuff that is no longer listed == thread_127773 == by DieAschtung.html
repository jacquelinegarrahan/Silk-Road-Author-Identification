				I wanted to order 50 pills from Chiquita but I did not have the funds to do so yet, so I added it to my cart and waited. 2-3 hours later I had the funds to make the purshase, so I hit my cart button and filled in my information. Right afterwards I checked Chiquitas profile and the pills I just had ordered were no longer avaible/ it was not listed..<br /><br />So is there a possibility that he was out of pills when I ordered? And the only reason i could make the order was that I had put it in my cart 3 hours earler when it was still listed?.. What will happen if he cant send it out? How long before i get my bitcoins back..?<br />

				You might have gotten the last of the pills. First of message Chiquitas and ask about your order. If you get no response and Chiquitas doesn&#039;t process the order then you can cancel in 4 days. If the order is processes and then shows its in transit whatever you do DON&#039;T FINALIZE until you have your product. If after 10 days you think your order isn&#039;t coming you can hit the resolve link and try to get a refund.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Vendors can put a limit/countdown on their products. I had one time where I put something in my cart, and a few minutes later went to check out and the item was gone from my cart and from SR too. Somebody stole it from me! Anyway. If your order went through the vendor should have the product for you, and it&#039;s probably in your hands already!<br /><br />JJ
