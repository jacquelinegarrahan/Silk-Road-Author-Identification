				How effective is it really? Does it really work? Can anyone provide more info about it online and what the specifics of it are? Is it just a rumor that it works? Do you know anyone who&#039;s used it? What happened to them?

				Plausible deniability is the most important thing, short of never dealing with LE at all, that saves your ass from getting charged or convicted.<br /><br />An example of how it works: A person gets pulled over for having their windows tinted on their car, but tells the police that the car was tinted like that when they bought it, so the cop lets them off with a warning instead of a ticket.<br /><br />Apply this principle to other situations where it&#039;s possible to say that &quot;it wasn&#039;t me&quot;. Cops and prosecutors don&#039;t want to deal with cases where they are likely to lose, so plausible deniability gets lots of the cases dropped or never charged.

				Spanky - I think you answered well, but not fully. <br />This point could be elaborated on...what really constitutes plausible deniability? If you get marijuana sent to your house, even if you left it unopened for 3 or 4 days - if someone were to show up and see that you have paraphernalia laying out - or some other substance related item, your plausible deniability is pretty much shot. <br /><br />That said, if your drop point is clean - and the person in question keeps their composure, etc - you&#039;re probably safe. <br /><br />In my experience (I don&#039;t have great luck with police) - the tinted window situation wouldn&#039;t work for me. <br />I recently borrowed my boss&#039;s car as mine broke down. I found out the first night that I drove it that the headlight was out. I got pulled over and ticketed, not let off with a warning - even though the car wasn&#039;t even mine, nor had a warning been issued previously. <br /><br />I think it depends on the situation, the person dealing with it, and the mood of the LE agent being dealt with.
