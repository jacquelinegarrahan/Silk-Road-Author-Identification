				Anyone else screwed by this new regulation about needing 50 posts to make any real posts outside of this board? I am right in the middle of an order and would love to talk bitcoin pump and dumps in the exchange market or why my vendor suddenly pulled all his listings for a specific substance (not his other listings) even though he is in top 2%. It&#039;s funny I have spent thousands of dollars on the road and have had this account the entire time and helped new folks myself but I am still being blasted in the ass by these new rules. I know something had to be done about the spammers but fuck it would have been nice to be grandfathered in or something. Now I have to make a dozen posts in here to even be qualified to speak again on the real discussions. For shame.

				Same. I&#039;ve only been on the forums for like 9 months but on the road for over a year. I think grandfathering in older accounts would have been a very reasonable solution (at least as much of a solution as what they did in fact do!) but my guess is that it&#039;s easier said than done. I suspect it&#039;d have to be done one by one, manually, but perhaps not.

				So what actually counts as a post? Does this simple question in an existing thread count? I should also mention I had to message a kind member I could find active in the Technical Support board just to find out about this new rule. There was nothing whatsoever made clear on the main SR forums page or anywhere else about these new rules, which frustrated me for hours until in desperation I messaged the most recently active member I could find to ask WTF was going on. It is really a shame they isolated a lot of devout members like this. Just because I am not super active in the forums and only place orders every few months doesn&#039;t mean I should be lumped in with spammers for fucks sake. Hell if you look back at my post history you can find a specific comment I made pointing out that some people might not necessarily choose to maintain profiles on the forums due to paranoia about law enforcement or simply because they don&#039;t have the time in their lives to frequent the forums. Whoever made this decision is really punishing the semi-lurkers who still have much to contribute to the community. I hope someone in power sees this and passes on the suggestion about grandfathering in older accounts or at least grandfathering in old accounts that have more than 20 posts or something.

Unfortunately there will always be spammers that find a way through, just like those who crack and pirate software or those of us who find novel ways to order our favorite substances at the click of a button. Look at craigslist casual encounters as a great example of the battle between a legitimate social-oriented website and spammers. They have been battling them for years and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We can only do our best to mitigate spammers and in the process hopefully not alienate too many real and passionate users. This current policy is a bandaid on a bullet wound and whoever is in charge needs to take a more proactive approach to this and at least minimize the fallout of loyal users that are getting fucked by this. There are better ways to handle this and this is simply fucking a lot of frustrated regular users and only a minor inconvenience to the spammers. Shit if they want to they can hire people at 5 cents an hour to fill out recaptchas so this security theater shit that looks like it&#039;s straight out of a TSA handbook for retards isn&#039;t going to cut it.

Absolutely no question about it. I think that making decisions to try to prevent spammers is a good idea in theory but that if not handled carefully it can lead to more problems than it solves. However, because I am relatively new, in that I joined the site about a month ago and only found the forum a few days before this rule was enacted, I see it as sort of arbitrary to be angry about it. I could&#039;ve just as easily joined today and never known the difference. Therefore it is a minor inconvenience to me. This is just one of the many rules I have to deal with while using SR, many of which I learned very recently. <br /><br />However, since we&#039;re complaining and I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll delete this thread, I&#039;ll say that I think the thing that most irritates me about this situation is that the moderators are allowing these newbie &quot;Count to 50&quot; spam threads to reach 150 pages of posts and then deleting them and making these people start over. That is the most painful and absurd thing to watch. I posted maybe 10 times in a thread that was deleted today. And now I&#039;m seeing the same people do it again. To whoever is making these decisions: please come forward and talk to the community about how you are handling this. We have some suggestions.

				Alright, here is my grand solution against the spammers. Please feel free to come in an dispute me, it&#039;s the only way for me to check myself against my own bullshit so I actually appreciate it. Also it helps me know if my ideas are stupid or not :D<br /><br />It requires randomizing the captchas, not just randomizing them, but randomizing the randomization of the styles of image effects. it all has to do with throwing off the program the spammers are using to bypass the verification process by making it more and more unpredictable. the coding may require a randomization of the captcha image effects and a further randomization of the decision of which effect (colors, stretch, skew, lines and combination of all, etc) The more sophisticated the better, any idea anyone can come up with to confuse a computer about an image but a human would easily see the better (of course that is a no-brainer I just realize that putting this into the forums requires coding beyond me so it requires work i cannot do myself and also would take a few weeks to do)<br /><br />Anyway just think of the verification processes we have to do in the clearnet, sometimes I&#039;m trying to decipher a captcha and i think to myself &quot;who the hell could possibly see what these letters and numbers are?&quot;<br /><br />Same idea applies here, it might piss people off to have to try and do this (especially if their really really really high, but i think it&#039;s worth it if it gets rid of the spammers for a while until they program themselves an equally sophisticated program to read the captchas)<br /><br />Alright... that&#039;s my idea, don&#039;t think I elaborated enough but we shall see, go ahead and tear me to shreds if my idea is stupid

And one that has been thought of before, and carried out. If you look into the history of CAPTCHA, there have been many different structural designs and features, some of which function basically as you describe. The problem is that someone has to actually sit down and write the code. This forum wasn&#039;t coded from scratch. DPR might have set up SR himself, but this here is just SMF 2.0.3, aka Simple Machines Forum, a popular free and open source forum design. The CAPTCHA code that we have to fill out here is actually the default CAPTCHA system that&#039;s built into SMF. Out in the clearnet, the vast majority of sites are now using reCAPTCHA, which is a service designed by academics at Carnegie Mellon. The reCAPTCHA service is designed to make users look at an image of a scanned word from a book and transcribe it into digital text, thus over a period of time digitizing books into Google&#039;s digital archives (for free). It is also a very reliable CAPTCHA system and you would be very hard-pressed to write a bot that can foil it. It has only been hacked once, and the problem was patched before the hack was even announced at the LayerOne 2012 security conference. <br /><br />Unfortunately for obvious reasons, an illegal darknet site like this one can&#039;t use reCAPTCHA because the people who run the service would need to agree to become at least tacit partners with DPR (notgonnahappen). And if it was deemed to be easier to use SMF rather than code a completely new forum, and if it was easier to raise the minimum post count than to individually ban spammers, I hardly think that the staff would take the time to code a new CAPTCHA. Doesn&#039;t seem to be their MO around here. No offense guys :)<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I&#039;m not even sure that the infrastructure of SMF allows you to replace the built-in CAPTCHA with another one.

And one that has been thought of before, and carried out. If you look into the history of CAPTCHA, there have been many different structural designs and features, some of which function basically as you describe. The problem is that someone has to actually sit down and write the code. This forum wasn&#039;t coded from scratch. DPR might have set up SR himself, but this here is just SMF 2.0.3, aka Simple Machines Forum, a popular free and open source forum design. The CAPTCHA code that we have to fill out here is actually the default CAPTCHA system that&#039;s built into SMF. Out in the clearnet, the vast majority of sites are now using reCAPTCHA, which is a service designed by academics at Carnegie Mellon. The reCAPTCHA service is designed to make users look at an image of a scanned word from a book and transcribe it into digital text, thus over a period of time digitizing books into Google&#039;s digital archives (for free). It is also a very reliable CAPTCHA system and you would be very hard-pressed to write a bot that can foil it. It has only been hacked once, and the problem was patched before the hack was even announced at the LayerOne 2012 security conference. <br /><br />Unfortunately for obvious reasons, an illegal darknet site like this one can&#039;t use reCAPTCHA because the people who run the service would need to agree to become at least tacit partners with DPR (notgonnahappen). And if it was deemed to be easier to use SMF rather than code a completely new forum, and if it was easier to raise the minimum post count than to individually ban spammers, I hardly think that the staff would take the time to code a new CAPTCHA. Doesn&#039;t seem to be their MO around here. No offense guys :)<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I&#039;m not even sure that the infrastructure of SMF allows you to replace the built-in CAPTCHA with another one. But it&#039;s not my area of expertise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well at least I thought up a good idea, seems like we can recode SMF captchas to do this on our own (without the need of outside code work) better than the captchas i see in the clearnet though, but i realize how much coding and work this would require. Oh well... least my post wasn&#039;t useless spam

You can picture it sort of like the Xbox Arcade. You download games and it also has a friends list and chat. I feel like it&#039;s pretty safe because LE wouldn&#039;t look there. They can get whatever info they want from Google, Hotmail, Yahoo etc. I just don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to subpoena the company that made Counterstrike for my records. It seems like a stretch. So that&#039;s why I suggested it. It&#039;s not &quot;anonymous&quot; per se in that your IP is still being shared with a company. But the likelihood that LE will subpoena that company and get our transcripts is very, very very very low.

Maybe it would have been a good idea to set this rule, but revoke the ruling for anyone with more than 5(?) transactions and longer than 3(?) months, but considering the forums and the vendor/buyer accounts are different, i suppose theres no way to enforce such things. Its upsetting, and annoying for you, im sure, but its just as annoying for me and its not that big of a deal :-)<br /><br />I assume they are trying to encourage people to post on forums for the benefit of EVERYONE in the scene.

				Why drag up a 4 month old post? Everyone knows the rules, they&#039;ve been like this for a while. I do agree it&#039;s pretty stupid, but surely only 10 or so posts would be enough to stop spammers. Now most people have to spam in order to hit 50 posts.<br /><br />Either way, there&#039;s nothing we can do so leave dead posts dead.
