				You should not have sent the BTC directly from where you purchased them to SR.&nbsp; You should always have another wallet in the middle.&nbsp; Buy the bitcoins, transfer to your own personal wallet THEN transfer to SR.&nbsp; To be even safer, transfer to your own wallet, then to a second wallet you also own that is running on another computer or in a VM.<br /><br />You should make sure that your wallet is set to run over TOR, further hiding yourself from being traced by your IP address. (You do that by going to Options/Network and setting the wallet to communicate via proxy using the TOR port number)<br /><br />While it is unlikely that someone is going to trace your transaction to SR, better safe than sorry.

				Sorry, forgot to say, don&#039;t worry, if you used the correct SR wallet code then the BTC will eventually show up in your SR account, just keep in mind it could take anywhere from an hour to 24 hours for it to show up, don&#039;t panic if when you login to SR you don&#039;t see your BTC, give it some time. And don&#039;t worry about SR being down, they are just doing some maintenance and should be back up soon.

				Next time you should try buying bitcoins with localbitcoins. It will create yourself a wallet and there&#039;s no bank or company involved in it. Usually you can meet with the vendor if they are near your city and they&#039;ll release the bitcoins and you&#039;ll know with a code on the website, and you can even pay cash.<br />

				honestly all this interconnectivity would sketch me out, but I am verry paranoid person. I have never used any exchanges or anything and I just like to sell either visa&#039;s or moneypaks(mostly the moneypaks) right on SR for bitcoins with trusted vendors, I cant wait till the day that there are just bitcoin street vendors lol i forgot big brother has cameras EVERYWHERE nowadays, apart from non urban/city like areas. I cant wait till I can live in the middle of bumfuck nowhere with like some crazy, hacked up anonymous satellite net service so i can still get my share of SR goodies =p

				You did fine. Might want to mix in a wallet or two between you and SR but no worries. SR tumbles the coins anyway so tracing them back to you is pert near impossible.
