				5 yellow Bentleys for under £20? Mario Stars, Lovehearts well reviewed pills for just over £5. That&#039;s cheaper than dutch vendor prices. <br /><br />Hmmm.

				I dunno. Ive been keeping an eye on this guys listings. Member for 9 days and zero transactions up until this Saturday morning and now he has 8 new transactions with 5/5 ratings in the space of an hour. Fake feedback maybe? You think its worth asking SR staff to have a look at this guys feedback?<br /><br />10 Dutch yellow Bentleys would work about £44? He&#039;s UK to UK. There&#039;s fuck all profit margin at those prices. <br /><br />Dodgy?&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I only ever buy domestic UK-UK and mostly pills. I&#039;m happy to pay the extra for imported pills just for the security. I had a look at him the other day and was gonna make an order but summit felt a bit fishy. Those prices do seem a bit off to be honest, unless he&#039;s buying at a real heavy discount? There ain&#039;t a lot of info on his sellers page either, although he does say no FE. Yeah I just had a look at that feedback too. <br /><br />Think I&#039;ll hold fire.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The thing with this SR system is that he cant earn anything if hes not doing it right as you know. Waste of cash. But if hes honest Ill sure buy at those prices..

				I placed an order to check them out and they&#039;ve failed miserably :(<br />I ordered 3.5g charlie last wednesday, it was placed in transit thursday and i&#039;ve yet to receive it.<br />I&#039;ve had no reply to my messages despite them being online every day.<br />I suspect i never received anything because i mentioned in a pm that i have full testing gear here, and their failure to answer messages since i sent that just confirms to me they&#039;re dodgy, I advise every one to steer clear.

				If it sounds too good to be true...you know the rest. If the vendor isn&#039;t requiring FE then it might be worth a shot since you could get a refund from resolution center if it goes south.

				Just posted the following in a similar thread about Loveheart.....<br /><br />I made 3 orders with Loveheart and they took over 2 weeks to arrive. For UK2UK that&#039;s absolutely fucking shit.&nbsp; PM&#039;d him a week ago before they arrived asking what was up. He replied that they&#039;d be with me soon and said he&#039;d refund one of the orders when they arrived to make up for the delay.<br /><br />Sent 2 PMs to him 3 days ago to say they had arrived and he hasn&#039;t even read them.<br /><br />Thing is, the quality of his drugs isn&#039;t bad at all. If he&#039;d bothered to send my shit out in a timely manner I would have ordered several more times from him in the time I&#039;ve been waiting for the first lot of orders.<br /><br />Judging from his feedback as well as my own experiences with him - he&#039;s clearly not a professional.&nbsp; I&#039;m very disappointed.&nbsp; Some people clearly have fuck all ambition.

His way of working is almost identical, as are his drugs. At the moment it looks like he is a selective scammer. Sending out some orders, and delaying the rest as long as possible, while building up a business and making it look like he is honest. At the very least, he has a large number of the Road&#039;s users names and addresses written down on paper, which is fundamentally a major security issue from every point of view. <br /><br />I would avoid like the plague. I have a small order with him, which I have no qualms about finalising on just to put the feedback in place. The problem is, every time he gets a negative response, he covers it with ten or so real transactions to hide it. The guy is a liability at best, and a scammer at worst. <br /><br />At any rate, with the access to drugs he has, he could go legit and make a fortune. He is therefore clearly not particularly bright. I expect his rating to plummet with a week or so, as all the people who have been diddled start realising that their products are not going to be turning up.&nbsp; If I am wrong, I would like to hear it from his mouth. But, of course, he does not answer messages.

				Guys, no offense but i think everyone is too quick to jump to conclusions. I placed an order on Thursday with LH and only afterwards bothered to check the forum (yes im just a pro like that....) After checking the forum i spent the weekend removing any trace of SR from the drop point just to be sure. People were saying hes a: <br />a) Scammer - Dont think so because iv received mine and i have a friend also received a small order (took a while yes)<br />b) Selective scammer - Unlikely, unless hes a dumb selective scammer because i placed an order of a significant size compared to his average listing price, it was all one product so it would have counted as one feedback. If he was selectively scamming it wouldnt make sense to send the large orders would it? you would send&nbsp; the small ones to keep feedback high and scam the large ones.<br />c) LE - Despite the fact i was shitting my pants a little that he might be LE, unless LE are trying out some long term strategy whereby they do actually deliver the drugs i can guarantee you that LH IS NOT LE!haha<br /><br />I ordered thursday and received monday which is not impressive domestic but its within the 3 days that he states. The package was AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER VENDOR again i can promise you hes spent time and effort in what he/she is doing, if my suspicions are correct as well as the stealth hes even taken &quot;special measures&quot; i can comment on that only vendors that really dont want to get arrested do (hopefully someone knows what i mean) . <br />Im well aware that people are waiting 10+ days but im in a position where i can say with 98% confidence that this guy isnt a scammer. He/she is selling cheap pills in the uk and has got swamped with orders. Maybe a noob mistake to run before one can walk but the guys an honest vendor i really do believe this. Now as his acc is closed ( possibly temporary? ) im not sure if you will receive your packages as he may think fuck that if hes not going to get the coins from escrow if hes permenantly banned, but if its a freeze then i have all faith you will receive. whether you receive the package or not all i can say for 100% is that he isnt LE. When i came to the forums after placing my order it was a horrible feeling to think i could be in danger of a controlled delivery. Personally i dont care if anyone receives their shit because we all run the risk and iv been scammed before myself but just dont give yourself a heart attack over people saying shit like &quot;hes LE&quot; im hoping he will be reactivated after he catches up with his orders to prove me right. <br /><br />Peace <br /><br />Rev

				Unfortunately, I&#039;ve already placed an order with LH, last Thursday (11th July), which remains at the processing stage in my orders page. After reading this post, I now have little confidence my order will be fulfilled. At least I&#039;m within escrow, which I&#039;m thankful for.<br /><br />In anticipation......

				I went to make an order with this seller previously and they would not accept my address in PrivNote. Seems strange as I&#039;ve never had a problem with that before. I decided not to try and re-submit my order with this vendor and hopefully everything goes ok for everyone else.

				smiley face, thats the same day i ordered mine but i sort of demanded no fucking around on time scales since i said id seen his comments said it was taking a while to arrive for most people. Im not supporting this guy because hes clearly fucked up but not having 2 or 3 pills arrive isnt even on the same scale as panicking that youve just sent your&nbsp; drop addy to the police. Its strange they havent just disabled his listings and allowed him to keep his home page open so people can see new comments etc

				I received my package 2 weeks after it was put in transit and It was short by a large margin. Paid for the ones I received and took the missing product to resolution. To be fair he agreed that he had made a mistake and refunded me in full for the missing product. I reluctantly gave him a 5/5 because he was fair with the resolution and the product I did get for the price was great. <br /><br />But two weeks UK domestic, wtf is that all about? Weird. <br /><br />The whole thing was very frustrating and worrying, thinking the package may have been seized. His communication was really poor too.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Revolutionista, settle yourself down, I&#039;m not worried about not getting &quot;2 or 3 pills&quot;, as I said I&#039;m within escrow, and as you know I now have the cancel option there, which I intend to avail of.&nbsp; I was simply joining in the debate, given I had a vested interest in the topic, that is all. For the record, I don&#039;t believe LE are involved, however likely that may be, and even less worried I&#039;ve just sent my drop addy to the fuzz. Apologies if it appeared like I was making a comparison to your very obvious plight, this wasn&#039;t my intention, as I previously stated I was simply joining in with my fellow roaders on a topic relevant to me, that is all.<br /><br />Peace.

The package was AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER VENDOR again i can promise you hes spent time and effort in what he/she is doing, if my suspicions are correct as well as the stealth hes even taken &quot;special measures&quot; i can comment on that only vendors that really dont want to get arrested do (hopefully someone knows what i mean) . <br />Im well aware that people are waiting 10+ days but im in a position where i can say with 98% confidence that this guy isnt a scammer. He/she is selling cheap pills in the uk and has got swamped with orders. Maybe a noob mistake to run before one can walk but the guys an honest vendor i really do believe this. Now as his acc is closed ( possibly temporary? ) im not sure if you will receive your packages as he may think fuck that if hes not going to get the coins from escrow if hes permenantly banned, but if its a freeze then i have all faith you will receive. whether you receive the package or not all i can say for 100% is that he isnt LE. When i came to the forums after placing my order it was a horrible feeling to think i could be in danger of a controlled delivery. Personally i dont care if anyone receives their shit because we all run the risk and iv been scammed before myself but just dont give yourself a heart attack over people saying shit like &quot;hes LE&quot; im hoping he will be reactivated after he catches up with his orders to prove me right. <br /><br />Peace <br /><br />Rev<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Luckily his grammar and style of writing are so obvious, that it&#039;s possible to recognise him from just a line or two of his writing. Just as well he doesn&#039;t post on Topix, or otherwise it would be very easy to get hold of his IP and address which, given that he has a long list of several hundred of the Road&#039;s users, would be a fucking disaster for everyone involved.<br /><br />Total. Liability. And. Moron.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Reepacheep youve given yourself away buddy. Your suggesting presumably that i am LH? Im not sure where to begin with that one since it wouldnt take sherlock holmes to see that actually based on the evidence you have at your fingertips you know thats not true. I am interested in knowing if your a fellow uk vendor though since it seems youve created a troll acc devoted to whipping up panic about the situation. <br /><br />Since if im being honest it does make me quite uncomfortable that your suggesting i have SR customers details (despite the fact iv never been a vendor) and your talking of my ip address i ask if any of the mods believe this for one second they should pm me. Im willing to hand over my SR acc password and start a new one just so they can verify that what iv said in my posts was 100% truthful. Id be upset to lose an acc with 0 refunds and quite a substantial amount spent but if my kamikaze meant killing even one troll acc such as yours im interested

For the record, I don&#039;t believe LE are involved, however likely that may be, and even less worried I&#039;ve just sent my drop addy to the fuzz. Apologies if it appeared like I was making a comparison to your very obvious plight, this wasn&#039;t my intention, as I previously stated I was simply joining in with my fellow roaders on a topic relevant to me, that is all.<br /><br />Peace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />im genuinely unsure how youve read that post? im just a trying to say i dont really care that much if someone doesnt receive an order however big it is i just dont want anyone panicking about LE (which they are) when i can guarantee even if hes a scammer hes not LE. Since sat/sun i myself worried about having given my drop addy to LE and if id read a comment like mine it would have made me feel a LOT better. <br />Did you receive a pm from LH this morning? Hes saying hes sending out all orders so fingers crossed if you havent received yours yet you will get it soon

				Received 1g speed from him, only took 3 working days for it to arrive in my case. It&#039;s definitely not LE, people need to stop fear mongering like that. LE doesn&#039;t send out chemicals. On the other hand, there is certainly some strange vendor behaviour going on here...
