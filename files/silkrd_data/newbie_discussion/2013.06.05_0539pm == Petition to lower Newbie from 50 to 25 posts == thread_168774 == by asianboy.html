				Going to 50 sux, but I definitely understand why it&#039;s in place and support it.<br />If you really need the 50 that bad just hit the spam thread in the stickies section.<br />Guess I&#039;m old fashioned or just not in a hurry, but earning the 50 with real meaningful posts shows people you actually have something to say and offer.

				While 50 does seem a bit much, I imagine it keeps a lot of the true slackers out. If you aren&#039;t willing to spam to 50 or gain the 50 by actual posts, you probably also aren&#039;t willing to search the forums for your answers and instead post whatever stupid shit you feel like. It is a barrier to entry that really isn&#039;t even that hard to get over. I had my 50 in about 20 minutes. If you can&#039;t dedicate 20 minutes then I wouldn&#039;t want you in here. <br /><br />My two satoshi.

				50 Posts really isn&#039;t that much, even if you have to spam them over Tor. Just have a show on in the background or do something else while you wait for the pages to load.

				Keep it the way it is in my opinion. Their are so many impatient people that don&#039;t bother trying to learn about PGP, Tails, or their online security looking for the quick fix(literally) that I believe SR is doing them a service they cant see yet. Take the time to learn new knowledge that will protect your own ass or just spam in the appropriate thread and see how ya go. It&#039;s very simple really. I don&#039;t understand why so many people complain about it.

				I second, third, fourth and fifth this! The cats voted lol <br /><br />But playing devils advocate here, If more people had to use the forums like they do now to get to the 50 posts, MAYBE just MAYBE the people of SR would be more educated and informed on everything it takes to run a vendor account, use pgp, know whos good for what drug of choice, etc...<br /><br />Now Ive changed my mind, Keep it at 50! lol
