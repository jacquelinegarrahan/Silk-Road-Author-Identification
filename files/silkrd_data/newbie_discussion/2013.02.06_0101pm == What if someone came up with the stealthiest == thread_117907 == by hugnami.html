				It depends... the stealthiest package ever would be also impossible to determine from a normal letter. The main thing you&#039;d have to worry about is all your parcels looking the same, as at some point when your business is growing bigger and bigger, LE are going to decide to make a small order from you to see how you package, so if all your parcels are the same or similar, they&#039;ll just pick those out of the mail. If you were &quot;flying under the radar&quot; and not worth LE ordering a package from you specifically (I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they did it at randomly anyway), you wouldn&#039;t need to change it until one got intercepted...<br />The best stealth is to have your packaging look exactly like every other non-conspicuous letter, so that even if LE knew EXACTLY how you were doing it, it&#039;s not worth their time to open, for example, every plain windowed envelope... The thing to remember is they&#039;re smarter than you, but they have limited time and resources. That&#039;s our ONLY advantage, and both sides know it.

				Erm how many letters go through the postal system everyday ha ha ha I can just see 1 lone devil assigned to picking out your letters n packages NOT,, if they do order from you it wouldn&#039;t be how you pack your shit it&#039;ll probably be prints or DNA they&#039;d be looking for which is the whole point of posting so that the vendor does not touch nor leave anything on the letters n packages full stop this is why every single vendor wears gloves etc and does not touch things with their bare hands or gets someone not known to pack the shit like so it&#039;s virtually impossible to get caught I reckon the only way to get caught by this way of doing things is if you get snitched on by one of your own other than that FUCK THE LAW AND THEIR SNITCHES this way of life will never ever be infiltrated by no devils nor their helpers hope this gave some people a bit of hope peace out, phoboss.

				Yeah, you could call that job &quot;screening mail&quot;... How do you think they get caught? If every envelope disguised as a certain companies letter, etc. But yeah, they&#039;re much more likely to check every piece of mail for &quot;prints or DNA&quot; than they are to look at it :)

				Just realized that last post didn&#039;t make sense, but I&#039;m just trying to get my post count up and I&#039;ve already put my 2c in. You obviously keep any trace of yourself off anything illegal you send, that&#039;s far from the &quot;stealthiest&quot; and more towards &quot;You&#039;re stupid if you don&#039;t...&quot;
