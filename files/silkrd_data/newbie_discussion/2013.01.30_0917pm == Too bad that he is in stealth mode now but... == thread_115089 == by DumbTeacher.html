				Did I get it right: he is now in stealth but if you are, or have been, a customer you will be able to buy from him now and in the future? <br />If not you will have to be recommended buy one of his earlier customers?<br /><br />And on the subject, do anyone know about the quality of his nasal spray?<br />Waiting for one right now, fingers crossed!

				I think stealth mode just means the vendor is away for the time being. I know there&#039;s a vacation mode too. If the vendor was only going away for a few days they would probably use vacation mode.

				He hasn&#039;t been on Silk Road in a minute. I will send him a message to see if he wants any additional customers, though. He hasn&#039;t responded to any messages for a couple of days. And all of his listings are down also.<br /><br />:-(
