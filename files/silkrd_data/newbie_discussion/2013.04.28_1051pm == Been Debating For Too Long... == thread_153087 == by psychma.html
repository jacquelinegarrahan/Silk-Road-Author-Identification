				Hi,<br /><br />After months of going back and forth I took the jump yesterday (I wasn&#039;t having problems yesterday.)&nbsp; I was so excited with my shopping cart - I needed to install some software for class and it restarted and today I can&#039;t get it... if only I had re logged back in.<br /><br />Well I&#039;m happy to be here and it&#039;s nice to say hello to everyone.&nbsp; I hope all is well!<br /><br />Psych

				Took me FOREVER to make up my mind for my first order. Ultimately decided on these criteria: 1) Something I&#039;d never tried before 2) Something odourless 3) ship/receive same country.&nbsp;

				I just want to assure everyone that SR is as resilient as can be...no matter who does attack this site, it WILL be back soon, DPR works tirelessly to make sure that we all can have this luxury, so have faith in this marketplace, and place some orders!&nbsp; 8)

				Wait, is it down again-again??<br /><br />DPR just announced that the Road is more resilient than ever after the last round of attacks, and announced the site-wide sale. It&#039;s down since then, or are we talking a few days back, now?

				Unfortunately, not a good time to be making your first purchase.&nbsp; :( More downtime for SR, and even the forums are a bit harder to access. And yes right after DPR posted that the site was up and stronger then ever and the sale. It&#039;s a shame. The attackers are showing some resliency but not compared to what DPR and the SR staff will show.
