				MIMM is a fucking joke. <br /><br />Itd be safe to say, most, if not all of his excellent rating are fixed, either by him, or his friends/partners.<br /><br />I wish every one would just stop biting on his hook, with the unrealistic prices.

				Hi All,&nbsp; I received my HH caine order from MIMM today!&nbsp; Yipppeeee, haven&#039;t tried it yet but the weight is bang on and it smells pretty pungent!&nbsp; I gotta say, I was getting a little skeptical from some of the posts I&#039;ve read about him lately, beginning to think it wouldn&#039;t show but it did!&nbsp; It was a domestic order with tracking, took about 10 days to arrive, all little slow for xpress shipping but I&#039;m sure he&#039;s a pretty busy guy.&nbsp; Stealth was excellent too!!&nbsp; I&#039;ll report back when I give it a whirl...<br /><br />Thanks MIMM!<br /><br />**Update**&nbsp; Count was right on and excellent quality!

But MIMM does (did?) send out legit product. I ordered 7 grams of ketamine and ..5 grams of MDMA a few months ago. After I placed the order I started reading some complaints about not receiving product, and got worried. I was afraid it wouldn&#039;t come, but it did. The ket is good, I read a lot of reports about it being cut, but it seemed decently on par with what I&#039;m used to. The MDMA was not great. Decently potent, but something besides MDMA.

				Maybe the undelivered orders were to Australia or something? The guy seems to do a lot of business, with a very wide-range of drugs. Not all of it can get through. He should be quicker on the reconciliation though. I imagine bigger vendors of his seeming size should be able to take the hit every now and again even if he is getting scammed.

				Hmm. I&#039;ve bought from MIMM and had no problem, so I&#039;m one of the genuine 5/5 (not recent).<br /><br />There were rumours of selective scamming, but I couldn&#039;t figure if they were legit or not.

				Amazing that he always seems to ask for 14 days extension and is granted every time.Still have 3 days to go of that extension and i dont like my chances.<br />So what if it is to Australia,other vendors seem to have no trouble getting it here.<br />If any body is interested he has started selling on BMR and so far from all his sales he has had nothing but rave reviews.<br />Insider knowledge? Does he know something about here that we dont?

				I&#039;m waiting on a package from this guy now which was supposed to have been shipped on the 16th and still hasn&#039;t gotten here. After reading all his feedback and some forum posts I&#039;m starting to think it&#039;s probably just not coming, and at this point even if it does get here I definitely won&#039;t be ordering from him again. I wanted to cancel this order anyway after it sat processing for several days, but of course right before I could do that he marked it &quot;in transit&quot;... This was my first order on the road too so it&#039;s kinda disappointing to have this happen.

				I just received what I ordered today. Very quick shipping, it took about 6 days, I have ordered from mimm several times with out a problem. His stealth is some of the best Ive seen, I almost couldn&#039;t find the product. So customs should be no problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Super newbie here, and I did my first order from him. I got it in about two weeks, with very stealth and excellent packaging. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if he&#039;s scammed people or not, but I know he has very specific instructions on how to place your order. If you look on his vendor page, he has a link to a forum posting with instructions, and if you don&#039;t follow them you&#039;re unlikely to get your order because he states:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You must provide your address EXACTLY as shown below.&nbsp; I use an automated order processing system so you must provide it in this format to give your package the best chance of delivery.&nbsp; Do not put anything other than your address in the address box when ordering - either clear text or via PGP.&nbsp; I use an address verification product to configure the address correctly into the format as used by your country&#039;s postal addressing requirements.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I got some ecstasy pills from him which are much better than what I&#039;ve been getting on the streets in my city, so I was very satisfied.

				Pretty new here. Have been ordering meth from mimm for some months now.<br /><br />Slow shipping but product was good. Don&#039;t know about the selective scammer rumours, but I&#039;m at five of five received domestic.<br /><br />My last order however, I&#039;m not so happy with. it looks like the cheap speed I used to buy 10 years ago (i.e like flour, with a few crystals in it), and when you burn it it bubbles red and then leaves a big black stain on my pipe.<br /><br />Have sent him a message to ask WTF. Will update.

				I have been seeing a trend over the past month that mimm is becoming either a selective scammer or just not doing something right anymore. I also heard that a mdma vendor in canada got hit and a lot of orders are being caught. Do not know if it is him. But, with his old stellar reviews to now a lot has changed with him. Maybe it is him, maybe it is not.
