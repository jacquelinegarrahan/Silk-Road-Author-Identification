				Hello fellow travelers!<br /><br />This weekend I (hopefully) will be having my very first LSD experience. The only other time I took it I didn&#039;t get anything out of it due to cross tolerance and heavy use of benzos a few hours prior, but I wanted to ask: What are some fun activities, and what would be a recommended dose for someone without a ton of experience with LSD? I have tried DMT, Mushrooms, and DXM HBR but from my understanding LSD is a much more profound and spiritual experience. Regardless, looking for some ideas and general discussion! 8)<br /><br />Thanks,<br />TheGiant<br />

				You&#039;ve tried all of those drugs but need advice on what to do while on LSD? Just do the same stuff.

				I might recommend taking it before sunset, get to a secluded spot at a park.&nbsp; Enjoy.&nbsp; Have some music.<br /><br />Also, you may not have experienced a trip because you didn&#039;t let the tab dissolve in your mouth long enough.&nbsp; You should taste the acidity, and leave it in 15-20.&nbsp; Maybe you did that, but I know of people who have made this mistake so just FYI.

				There is no more spiritual experience than DMT. To me DMT delivers all the visuals LSD promises.<br />In a short comparison I would say that with LSD you are opening up yourself to exogenous impressions, seeing the world and everything in it from different angles, but it comes with a lot of confusion. With DMT you open that door in your mind for the other world.<br /><br />Regarding dosage I recommend a minimum of 200 mics. In the 60s a normal dose was around 500 mics. IMHO there is nothing worse when doing LSD than taking not enough of it. Everything about 1,000 mics are heavy doses and I have not gone further than 1,200 mics and see no need to. <br />Take it at once. I never got very much out of topping up.<br />A pal once drank a bottle with 15,000 mics at once. It took him 6 months to return to baseline - but he came back unharmed.<br />Keep a mimimum of 2 weeks between trips to avoid tolerance that also cannot really be overcome by taking higher doses.<br /><br />If the blotter tastes bitter and comeup takes around 2 hrs you did not get LSD but 25i-Nbome which is similar but still cannot be compared to the real stuff. It is easily detected by tasting the blotter. If it tastes bitter it is not LSD. Real LSD is taste- and odourless and the trip will beginn after 20 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />There is no such thing as a bad trip when you observe one rule: With LSD one tends to develop spiralling thoughts and what is often described as a horror trip is actually people entering a negative thought spiral and become entangled in it.<br />If your thoughts turn negative, change the setting and direct your mind to something else, e.g. leave the room and go outside. A tripsitter is never a bad idea but either I go alone or I take LSD together with my partner. <br /><br />About things to do while on LSD...<br />Music is paramount and I prefer to run my MP3 player in&nbsp; a mode that does not require any action during the trip. iTunes Visualizer is way better than anything else if you need a flickering screen. Don&#039;t waste the queen of psychedelics to watch a movie.<br />Oh, and when you find decent LSD here on SR, pls PM with the vendors name. <br /><br />

				Be outside where you won&#039;t be disturbed.&nbsp; If it&#039;s going to be nice weather, go camping.&nbsp; Set up camp before you take any drugs.&nbsp; If there are trails, go for a walk.&nbsp; If there are scenic overlooks, look over them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like TV or computer visualizations.&nbsp; They can be very captivating.

				I hung out at a park with a friend my first time doing LSD. Amazing time just sitting in the grass and looking in the sky. I&#039;d done mushrooms and salvia before. Mushrooms were more of a mindfuck for me and the comedown was rough. I thought I died from 60x salvia. Super strong experience but I didn&#039;t like it. Acid was my fav of the bunch.

				Same as me mate&nbsp; ;D<br />Just received 5 blotters and about to test them soon,also,this will be my first time...<br />I heard alot about nature is a good setting for psychedelics and especially for LSD,also sunsets are should be beautiful to observe,but of course the trip lasts much longer.<br />Find yourself quiet place,preferably outdoors where there is a good view.

				All wonderful suggestions from the lot of you! I do appreciate it. I believe a walk to the beach in the early morning might the in order. The reccuring theme I&#039;ve been seeing is &quot;sunrise&quot; and &quot;Sunset&quot;. It seems like it&#039;s the thing to do.
