				it will last forever! DEA knows about it, if they could shut it down they possibly would.<br /><br />Actually who can prove that some Very High company is NOT behind this? a goverment, dea,&nbsp; or so. As long as tor is freely available, SR will live along. And i noticed that DPR&nbsp; (and thanks for that) has made the browsing on the site very much more faster, than it was one month ago (when i first joined).&nbsp; it handle the amount of users. And i keep trying to remember how I found out about SR.. i have always been googling buy drugs online etc, but why i was made known to me at the time it did, is another factor, proving that even google results are manipulated for some reason...

				Unfortunately I think this site time is limited, although I hope some force of nature intervenes and allows the site to continue to thrive for years. But I believe that more and more people will incrementally flock to SR and allow it to grow which is positive but could could also bring more opportunity for scammers and/or less knowledgeable users drawing unnecessary attention. But I want to be wrong, probably am. I&#039;d say two and a half years at most.&nbsp; :(

				Hopefully until the end of prohibition. Tor being shutdown would make access to SR no longer possible. Although i&#039;d say the likelihood of SR itself being shutdown is slim to none. Time will let us know though.

				&quot;The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room&quot;<br /><br />I think the largest protection any site such as this has is its low profile. Naturally, the more the SR fanbase grows the more general - and negative - attention will grow. That said, P2P sites the likes of TPB, with clever management, can outlast many obstacles and legal pursuits. Eventually anything like this will become a victim of its own success and have to make adjustments/compromises.<br /><br />Time will tell, it will be interesting to see how hard authorities fight to take down such an entity as this over a few drugs that cause only minor public harm compared to how hard MPAA &amp; RIAA fight their &#039;demons&#039; being driven solely by greed.<br /><br />I think that what SR is doing is quite noble, it brings drug ethics questions to current day, it shows that decisions made by governments decades ago may not be quite right in a modern setting. It appears that management here is keen to run for the long term, making the choice to eliminate &#039;The Armory&#039; shows they want to avoid head-to-head confrontation, that type of thinking should keep SR around awhile.<br /><br />Because of the nature of Tor and SR&#039;s online presence I think the site itself will be very tough to jeopardize/subjugate, authorities may attempt to reign in the traffic and attempt to disrupt transactions in the real world, especially when it comes to high volume stuff...but even this early on they probably still are fumbling with explaining the finer details of the SR system to one another. XD<br /><br />People have mailed illicit things long before SR existed, many have gotten away with it, we are seeing the US gov&#039;t lash out at UPS &amp; FedEx over sloppy screening practices. Proper stealthing will become increasingly important in the future. So long as we have confident vendors and an active market it will be ok, we just should be on the lookout for any attempts to shake confidence through &#039;fake&#039; vendor accounts. That, I think is the largest current threat - shaking the confidence of users.

				I think it will be around for a long time. This site is a part of a new era - the era of Internet! Internet has reshaped our world and will continue to do so in the coming decades. I think that the older generation, those who are in power now, can&#039;t really comprehend just what the internet is and what it does to our society. In the specific context of Silk Road it has reshaped the drug market. The consumers of drugs can now trust that what they are putting in their bodies actually is what it is claimed to be. Much thanks to the community on this forum. We can get quality products from quality vendors that care about their customers, both their safety/health and economics, since the competition on this kind of market brings that forward. If SR would be shut down, another site would start within months or years, using even better technology than today. <br /><br />The only thing that could make SR, and/or any follower, go away for good is if the people in power realize that a paradigm shift has occurred in how drugs are being traded and that (thanks to the new technology of the internet) people will get their drugs easily and safely delivered to their doors no matter what, and that they change their policy in regard to drugs and simply come up with something that makes SR superfluous. Say for example a government controlled drugshop where any adult can get whatever drugs they want together with scientific information on harm reduction and safety. And then we won&#039;t really need SR anymore.<br /><br />***Silk Road will be around as long as we need it***

				I reckon about 5-10 years in its current form.<br /><br />I think America will legalise marijuana fully in that time frame which will lead to Europe following suit.<br />I also think as a result of the success stories of legalising marijuana many countries will decriminalize drugs when they see that the war on drugs is failing and take a lesson form Spain/Portugal&#039;s book and just decriminalise everything, saving money and reducing the profits of drug cartels etc.<br /><br />When everything is decriminalised there will be no need for the SR anymore except for maybe being a legal marketplace for amazing substances.<br />So i think SR will be reborn as a legal entity and DPR will become the next warren buffet
