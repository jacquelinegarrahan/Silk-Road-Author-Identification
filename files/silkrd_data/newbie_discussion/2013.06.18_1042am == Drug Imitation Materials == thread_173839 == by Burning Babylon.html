			<dd class="postbody">
				My aim with this thread is to be complimentary to my thread Wrapping Techniques: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173129.msg1243537 With &quot;Drug Imitation Materials&quot; I mean any material that as closely as possible imitates any real life drug in terms of it&#039;s texture, appearance and weight but is legal and cheap to acquire. Why would anyone want this you might ask yourself? The answer is to be able to blend a specific sold product with the Imitation Materials so it feels, looks and weights the same for anyone either inspecting the package or watching the contents through a X-ray machine. It could also be used to send for example an identical package but with the actual product replaced with the Imitation Material to someone in Australia and see if it makes it through customs without being opened. Now granted this will not necessarily help in any way if the package is opened regardless ( unless it&#039;s just a test run as it won&#039;t matter then ) as I&#039;ve described shortly in my thread Customs wreck Lego collector&#039;s Star Wars model: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=173833.0<br /><br />Now usually I would start off with giving some example myself but as we&#039;re only dealing with Hash and Cannabis I have a very hard time coming up with something that is similar. For those not familiar with at least mid-grade/standard Hash it&#039;s basically powder-like from the Cannabis plant heat pressed into bits. It&#039;s very hard to cut into without any heat and if done incorrectly it will crumble easily if cut near the edges or with too much force. Any tips on possible plants or likewise that could be used as supplements when heat pressed in an experimental mail run?

The problem though as I see it I have a very hard time believing the majority of the mail currently being intercepted is due to dogs, especially into Sweden where a lot of Silk Road orders are getting intercepted for some reason (which is one of the reasons Domestic Vendors here haven&#039;t been outdated yet).

				You say it&#039;s a &quot;non-issue&quot;, but it&#039;s likely one of the biggest reasons for interception.&nbsp; Sure, everyone should be using MBB and washing down the outside of the bag in a clean environment then bagging again in another MBB, but it&#039;s still possible for traces to end up outside and that&#039;s enough to set off a dog&#039;s nose/particle detector.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m not convinced that such a shipping test reveals much: suppose LE open the package; they will discover it&#039;s legit, but almost certainly see it for what it is (a dry run) and thus carefully reseal and forward in such a manner that their interception is undetectable.&nbsp; They will then add the package&#039;s profile to their database and be sure to carefully inspect any followup in the future.&nbsp; So, you&#039;re none the wiser and end up sending the goods anyway: may as well just have sent them in the first place.

I never lost a package. A FedEx employee I was in rehab with told me that it is likely that 10% of parcels are drugs. He knew the cameras were down at the warehouse he worked at, and figured out what the parcels that were from Big-Pharma factories and contained &quot;Patient Assistance Program&quot; drugs looked like (and rattled when he shook them). He supported his habit by skimming packages. He even kept a whole parcel that had been sent to an empty house... he got a large amount of weed and something else from that parcel. His last score before rehab was 500 Dilaudid pills (he didn&#039;t IV his pills, and so they weren&#039;t worth shit to him... he had fronted them to a friend, likely to never see the money. i was practically drooling as he told me about it). Karma caught up with him though, as he was in rehab thanks to his free pill supply. His knowledge/insight was great though. Using domestic mail is rather safe, in my opinion. Especially if you are ordering &quot;personal amounts&quot; of drugs.<br /><br />My plan is to order what I want to do the day the package arrives... If you have taken the drugs already, it doesn&#039;t matter if LE knows you had drugs mailed to you. Unless you are driving or making a scene in public, being under the influence is not illegal (especially in your own home).<br /><br />Just my two cents on the subject...<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Indeed.&nbsp; And one doesn&#039;t even need to steal others&#039; mail to benefit from working in the postal service/as a courier: it becomes trivially easy to have deliveries sent to a destination on your route, then intercept.&nbsp; I guess the companies shuffle drivers around a bit to prevent this?&nbsp; I suppose one would then need to intercept at the sorting facility - either before delivery (in which case its loss will probably be noticed), or else on return after being refused (one would need to know that delivery will fail and will need to devise some way to make it appear as though the package has been legitimately collected without being caught on CCTV).&nbsp; Probably easier just to run a mailbox service.

This guy knew the security cameras in the sorting facility had been disabled by a storm months back and never repaired. He would set boxes to the side, open them in a &#039;private spot&#039;, skim, and reseal the parcel and send it on its way. The box sent to the empty house was a no-risk thing for him... &quot;Um, I had a large amount of drugs sent to a vacant house and it never showed up, what gives?&quot; Like I said, he got his karma... Though, FedEx was paying for the rehab as he admitted he needed help before being reprimanded for being strung-out. Who knows what the time since I knew him has brought him though?<br /><br />I appreciated the info that 1 out of every 10 packages is likely drugs. Shipping stuff domestically is safe. The USPS and UPS, FedEx, and DHL would be screwed if they stopped shipping drugs for people. Ha. I like using USPS as it makes the government an accessory to the victimless crime.

				Looking back at this with some more experience I realize the only proper way of utilizing this concept is with a sensory overload approach. For example one could send a package with 10-20 mylar bags included where 19 of them are &quot;legal&quot; and the last one has the product. Either one would attempt to make them look as similar as possible for a x-ray, or the complete opposite with as randomized as possible.<br /><br />If one would have the right packaging equipment one would attempt to package it similar to some kind of Oxygen Absorbers, example: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0028AG8RO/ If not the Oxygen Indicators could be put in a double or triple sealed vacuum package which is see through with a MBB at the very bottom - the Oxygen Indicator would be visible from outside the mail but perhaps with the &quot;Oxygen Indicator&quot; text hidden or removed. If one were to send a see-through package like this to a Mail Forwarder or Virtual Office and they take a photograph of the front it would be possible to see if the Customs Agency has tampered with the package or not.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />As for the aspect of imitation itself in the perspective of an x-ray I suppose no one will be able to answer that directly unless they either work in a Customs Agency or know someone who does.
