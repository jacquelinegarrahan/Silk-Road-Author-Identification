				I placed an order with Virwox and under status it states that it is filled, But my SR acct still has a balance of 0. Is there another waiting period I am not aware of?

				It can take a couple hours to show up in your SR account. You transferred to your BTC deposit address?

				Be careful with Virwox. They closed my account apropos of nothing stealing a considerable amount of money from me. This was after about ten perfectly smooth transactions. I was going to complain but I had completely forgotten the e-mail account I had used with them.

				Sucks to hear.....I&#039;m at about 10 transactions....so I&#039;ll keep an eye on things....I never leave money in my account there ...it just gets deposited, exchanged (twice, the bastards), and immediately withdrawn in about a minute....&nbsp; &nbsp; I love the convenience of it...but the fees are killer...and if they stole your money that&#039;s just whacked.&nbsp; &nbsp;
