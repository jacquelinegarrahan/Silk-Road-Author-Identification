				people will keep buying bitcoins no matter what they cost. i think you dont understand what bitcoins are. dont tell others to be quiet when u not have a bit of an idea urself :)&nbsp; for my age im pretty sure im way older than the average in here. dont worry about that.<br /><br />They will raise no.matter.what. so many people got to know bitcoins lately. so many people want to have bitcoins. soon there will be more people wanting bitcoins as there will ever bitcoins be produced. that will lead into the bitcoin will raise ALOT! that doesnt matter tho. as long as its not getting hacked or closed by the feds it is still a somewhat stable paying system. not the seller and not the buyer has to be worry about anything. it will constantly raise. there will not come the point where less people want it. be smart and adapt :)

				Phoboss, refusing to take part in a BTC exchange simply because its dollar per unit price is so high is pretty silly. Especially as how many, if not all of the prices on SR are pegged to the USD and do not fluctuate with BTC. Basically, there is actually no loss or gain with regards to the total amount of buying power with regards to the BTC price. <br /><br />If you pay 20 dollars for one BTC, you still get 20 dollars worth of BTC on the road.<br />If you pay 20 dollars for two BTC, you still get 20 dollars worth of BTC on the road. <br /><br />You may want to review some math. Also, looking at how both of your posts here are huge run on sentences with no regards for proper punctuation, I would be questioning your age more so than I would be questioning b0m&#039;s age. <br /><br />Dantana, I believe the last major crash took it down to either 1$/BTC or .01$/BTC, I&#039;m not sure.

				The best thing you can do is NOT spend all your BTC. <br /><br />Keep a reserve of as much as you can. While the market grows, so will the value of your stash. <br /><br />I imagine it&#039;s hard not to put it up your nose. But try. You can buy more (for less) later.<br /><br />Your DrugBuddy.

				The only reason I went to the trouble to get bitcoins is so I could use them here and for other digital purchases. It is an ever growing option on the web to pay with bc!<br />If I wanted to invest in something it would be gold or silver, if the US economy did crash, everything currency tied to the dollar would bottom out wouldn&#039;t it? If US $ are worth <br />nothing wouldn&#039;t that reflect on the value of BC?<br /><br />Peace

Also due to the difficulty of cashing bitcoins out, as time passes more and more bitcoins are being held as savings by venders and bitcoin service operators thus lowering the supply. The question is when and at what price will those savings finally be cashed out. What an interesting journey this is going to be watching bitcoin grow.

				It`s important to mention that NOT ALL vendors are adjusting their prices to bitcoin values..<br />There can often be a lag, this makes it tricky if you don`t happen to stock pile a bit in a wallet or three.<br /><br />Either way, a sign of a reputable vendor is that they aren`t going to pwn you in the exchange rate trade offs.<br />But it is a way for them to make a little bit more cash.

				prices get adjusted automatically with the price of mt.gox. Vendors can setup their offers to stay in the bitcoin price they ask, or change accordingly to the rates sold at mt.gox.<br /><br />by the way, back on topic. what did i say? :D the explosion has just begun i say.<br /><br />i think its not a few guys buying a lot of bitcoins to raise prices (maybe there are a few), the ones who are responsible for that are the much people who got to hear about bitcoins lately. there are probably a lot only buying it to speculate. but also a lot to use it as its supposed to (you, me) and also alot miners. its just logical - there are constantly more people who hear from bitcoins (it spreads like a good virus/worm), it cant get less u know. the one who know about it - know about it. it can only grow basically. when feds shut down exchangers the price will fall in the first place but raise big in the long run). basically the only thing that could kill the bitcoins is a bitcoin hack. but as this is a open source program, a LOT of hackers already tried that very hard. but no success. that kind of indicates that its not possible with todays technology. Which makes it pretty safe in my opinion and there is no way that the rates will ever fall in the long run (unless bitcoins get hacked of course)<br /><br />it is not a bubble. i think it has never really been a &#039;bubble&#039;. the time when prices fell was the time hackers hacked alot of exchanging platforms. people lost trust in the bitcoin when they should have lost trust in the exchanger platforms instead. There will come the time when they realize that. from there on on the prices will not fall so dramatically when some exchanger gets hacked. then the value of those exchanger will fall but not the prices for bitcoins.<br /><br />i bet by the end of the year prices will be above 50€/coin (in fact i think it will even hit 100€) anyone? :)<br /><br />i for myself will certainly collect as much bitcoins as i can afford. bitcoins has very big potential in my opinion

As far as I can tell, there is no real reason the market has exploded in the past few weeks/month. I think it will correct itself eventually. However, as more and more (legal) retailers adopt this payment method, there&#039;s no reason it shouldn&#039;t continue to rise in value versus government issued currencies (in the short term, anyway). <br /><br />I think that the Dec 31 2013 value will be significantly higher than the Dec 31 2012 value, but I&#039;m not convinced it will be higher than what it is worth today (unless of course some major retailer starts accepting payments or some other action that brings the currency to the masses). <br /><br />Then again, I thought the market would have corrected already, so maybe in 10 months a bitcoin will be worth $929529.84 and you can all quote this post and tell me what an idiot I am.

				In regards to investing, it&#039;s still very risky imo to jump in too deep. Currently,&nbsp; I&#039;m saving half of my BTC and cashing half out when prices jump. I figure if I lose half in a rapid decline I can buy back in with the cash at the bottom for the climb back to even out again. It will be interesting to watch BTC for the next few years that&#039;s for sure.

				I agree with what many are saying here. I have just recently started my &quot;reserve&quot; of bitcoins. I want to save up as many as humanly possible because even though they do go up and down (lately they just keep going up!) If you know anything about how bitcoins work, overtime the price HAS to go up and it will go up A LOT and stay stable at that price because it is not like other currencies, there is a certain number of bitcoins that will ever be produced, unlike cash which more and more can just be printed. By the time bitcoins are fully mined they could be easily worth thousands for a single coin but that does not mean it costs anymore to buy things with them.....Say a coin is worth in the thousands but you only need to buy a few hundred dollars worth then you would get something that looks like 0.00000001 of a bitcoin......it really is not to hard to understand if you do some reading about it. It took me a long time to understand bitcoin but I made sure I had the whole concept down before starting to vend here. I am already very much experienced in the mail order business so joining Silkroad is the best thing that could have happened to me :)

But i do see more and more people get to know bitcoins, so obviously more&nbsp; and more people want to have them (specially investors, there is barely anything legal today that raise in rates that hard and steady). and the more people get to know them the faster the word is getting spread - i imagine it like a virus/worm kind event. friend one tells friend two &#039;hey, look at this, the bitcoin prices exploded from 10 to 50 in just 2 month, maybe we should invest&#039;. friend one keep on going and tells friend three, four, five...., while friend two(three/four/five) does the same thing. so in my opinion there is no way of it to stop raising if nothing significant happens. Investors obviously hording their coins, thats their job. So even less bitcoins hit the market, making the price go up even more. satoshi dice i havent read up at all yet, but i believe every single market that now start accepting bitcoins will rise the prices aswell. there are so many factors that leads to the rates rising, but i can really only see one which crashes them - that is a hack. if sr goes down the rates fall a bit for a small amount of time. but people will go for bmr or other blackmarkets then. <br /><br />Anyway i hope my predictions are right and they keep raising. its not bad for anyone actually. not bad for the buyers and not bad for the sellers. not for ANYONE but maybe the economics if too many companys accept it. if the supermarket starts to accept it, it will be bad for actual currencies because they would fall in rates. that happens because to much money is printed.... i feel like im going to far off here<br />*these are only speculations by me and not to be taken seriously* just my thoughts.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m thinking that if more people continue to get into it, it&#039;s simply a supply and demand issue.&nbsp; Since bitcoins are now harder to mine and the growth is limited (google halving day), the supply is limited.&nbsp; Of course it all goes to hell if someone tries to convert a big chunk back to Government currency.&nbsp; That being said currency speculation is a great way to lose your shorts.<br />

				Unless I am mistaken, BTC has jumped about 7 dollars since i checked yesterday. Crash has got to come soon, saving up my cash for when it happens. I would say 2 weeks tops before it collapses.

				The market value will rise as long as their is demand, with supply limited (as it will always be). Also, the exchanging of hands of BTC for goods/services/IRL currency affects it as well. Another factor is the value of the different fiat currencies and digital currencies (CC and EBT) accepted and circulated by different countries around the world. They continue to print off more bills, many have dropped any concept of a Gold Standard (or any other Standard) and now attach an imaginary value to their currency of choice, which allows for the hyperinflation some countries see (e.g. &#039;Merica...fuck noooo!). The value of a BTC is pinned to the collective values of physical fiat currencies of world Superpowers (USA, UK, EU, CN, etc.), therefore...the worth of a BTC will only truly be independent of established currencies once it is universally (or close to) accepted as payment for goods/services.<br /><br />Hope this shed some light.

The chucklehead never has anything respectable or polite to say, ever. Too bad you can&#039;t fix stupid.
