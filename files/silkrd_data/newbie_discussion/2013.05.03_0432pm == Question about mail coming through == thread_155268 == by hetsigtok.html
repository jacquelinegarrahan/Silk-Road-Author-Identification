				So I just moved abroad to a country by the Mediterian sea. I have rented an ampartment and Im now living in an apartment complex with maybe 50 apartments. What I noticed when I checked the mailbox is that there is no name on any of them, just apartment numbers. Since Im not to keen on using my real name when I order some candy from SR I figured I might aswell use a fake name. Any advice on this? I do want the package to make it through tho but if there are no names listed on the mailboxes it shouldnt be a problem using a fake name no? <br /><br />Would very much appreciate some feedback on this.<br /><br />

				Send yourself a letter and see for yourself.<br /><br />And I&#039;d think using, &quot;Resident,&quot; or no name at all would be better than a fictitious name.

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it, the mailman will be suspicious if you use a name he hasn&#039;t seen before at that box, also putting Resident makes it look like a spam box and may be more scrutinized I dunno.&nbsp; You can start sending mail to another name to your same address and build some credibility with the mail guy, but when it comes down to it there is no other record of that person living there, best and safest way is to use your own name so you have leverage against any funny stuff.

				I think you&#039;re overthinking it!&nbsp; If you just stick to what works you should be ok.&nbsp; You&#039;re right about the mailman doing his job but you&#039;re also wrong.&nbsp; They are still USPS employees, not robots!&nbsp; Just stick to what works, there&#039;s thousands of people on here and we all have deliveries in our own name.&nbsp; Going outside the box here just isn&#039;t worth the risk.&nbsp; You can speculate all kinds of different scenarios.&nbsp; Point is for small personal quantities you should use your own name!

				There&#039;s no name physically printed on any mailbox, but if someone is getting all their bills sent to them under one name, and then getting packages sent to John Doe twice a week, it may look a little odd.

				Use real name otherwise its a red flag. Check the forums on packaging and delivery and you will have plenty others confirm this.

				I&#039;ve always been told use your real name, if you&#039;re ever asked to sign for anything refuse the package and cut your losses.

				You could use your name or a variation of your name? <br /><br />Perhaps use a different for name?
