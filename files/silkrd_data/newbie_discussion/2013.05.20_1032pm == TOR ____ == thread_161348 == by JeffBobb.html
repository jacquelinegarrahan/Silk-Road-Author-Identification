				Im new to using the SR, and TOR.&nbsp; Im quite sure, that like all browsers, TOR needs updating every so often.&nbsp; Even on&nbsp; the drop down menu on the &quot;onion&quot; button at the top of the TOR browser, there is a link you can click on that says &quot;Download TOR browser bundle update&quot;.&nbsp; The only thing is, when I click on that, it just takes me to where I origionally downloaded the TOR browser bundle, and says nothing about an update.&nbsp; Am I doing something wrong, or does it look like this all the time?

				check to see if the version you are running is the same as whats on the download site, if its not or if your unsure, just download it again and install.&nbsp; it should tell you on check.torproject.org if you need to update.

You may have to delete the previous version of Tor if you simply extracted the updated version to the previously existing folder.<br /><br />To do this, make sure you backup any bookmarks you have as they will be deleted:<br />Bookmark button -&gt; Show All Bookmarks -&gt; Import and Backup -&gt; Backup...<br /><br />Go to torproject.org and download the latest version of Tor. Securely delete the previous Tor folder. Double click the new Tor download and extract it to a folder of your choice. Start it up once that&#039;s all finished and then restore your bookmarks.<br />Bookmark button -&gt; Show All Bookmarks -&gt; Import and Backup -&gt; Restore -&gt; Choose File...<br /><br />That will resolve the problem (if there&#039;s a problem in the first place!)<br /><br />Libertas<br />

				also for security reasons i wouldnt suggest keeping any SR links directly related to you on the bookmarks, just in case you get raided. <br />I personally just keep one bookmark of the SR homepage,one for the forums main page and one for the tor directory.<br />&nbsp;but never keep one for your account page or any items you order or anything that can be directly linked back to you, they will use it against you in court. <br />also don&#039;t have any auto complete or auto form filling out features enabled in the tor browser, there turned off by default but don&#039;t turn them on yourself.

				Libertas - Just a thought, it&#039;s not best practise to leave anything in your torbrowsrer, like bookmarks, plugins, etc. If you are comfy with the risk, that&#039;s cool, but others should be aware, this is not the safest way of doing things.

It is important that they are at least taking the most basic security precautions, and once they are doing that, they can graduate on to more secure solutions.<br /><br />Libertas

				is it possible to use bitcoin from tails? ive never bothered to setup persistance, but i imagine that keeping the blockchain information updates would be a pain in the ass. are there secure clients that dont need the blockchain or full blockchain to send/recieve btc? i imagine it would be the most secure method of sending and recieveing btc to have a tails only encrypted client and wallet that is used for SR transactions.
