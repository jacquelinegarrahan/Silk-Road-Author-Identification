				For some reason I cant post to the rumor mill for this post. But just getting the information on here may save a buyer from making the same mistake.<br /><br />Just a warning for people looking to actually receive products on SR. Googleyed / GoogleyedXL is in the top 3% of sellers. He shouldnt even be a seller on SR. This seller selectively rips people off on orders. SWIM ordered some K from him and it arrived heavily cut in talcum powder. Easily 70% Talcum powder. This wasnt the point of complaint.<br />The second order was larger (not knowing about the talcum powder until much later). This scammer will string you along telling you to wait and wait and wait. Then ignores you.<br />This link is a great read on knowing your K. Which pointed out how shitty of a seller Googleyed is.<br /><br />http://www.tripproject.ca/trip/?q=node/1960<br /><br />If you want quality product, go to Project4 or MIMM.

				I originally heard that Googleyed was a great vendor- don&#039;t know the proper pronoun to use for the vendor- , and right as I was about to buy from &quot;him&quot; (luckily) I was informed that &quot;he&quot; basically went rogue. Wasn&#039;t responding to emails, and there had been some weird rumor that &quot;he&quot; was dead.<br />Super sorry to heard that you got ripped off.

If you get shitty feedback, because you provide a shitty service, it shows up on your rating, and people will not buy from you. Unhappy customers = shitty rating = shitty sales = no money. You can not maintain a good rating and &quot;selectively scam&quot;. It is hard enough to maintain a good rating as it is, when you have issues with product getting caught by customs, or any other of a vast number of problems which occur when sending illicit drugs half way across the globe. Trust me, no one who &quot;selectively scams&quot; will be a vendor for more than a month.<br /><br />The feedback system of SR is MASSIVELY customer biased. You can not scam people and maintain a legitimate business. Anyone who even uses the term &quot;selective scammer&quot; to describe a long standing vendor is firstly and idiot, and secondly either butthurt, or a as in this case, a rival vendor posting to try and discourage customers from going to their competition.<br /><br />Also, as a point of note, if your product doesn&#039;t arrive, all you have to do is contact your vendor, and they will help you. People who get butthurt, leave a shitty rating, and then come on forums and flame and just hurting themselves. It should only be a last resort. Vendors are there to provide a service, and if there has been a problem along the way, they will fix it. Simple. No need to be an asshole, just politely ask for assistance. In fact, I think I will go start a thread about this, as I have notice a lot of noobs making this mistake lately..<br /><br />Peace out homies! GE

				I want to clarify, I never actually personally dealt with Googleyed or anything like that, so what I posted was a rumor I heard in the rumor mill/ from a friend and I obviously have no idea if it was true or not.<br /><br />I hope it wasn&#039;t! And I don&#039;t mean to spread any bad vibes, so sorry about that :/ <br />PLUR to everyone.
