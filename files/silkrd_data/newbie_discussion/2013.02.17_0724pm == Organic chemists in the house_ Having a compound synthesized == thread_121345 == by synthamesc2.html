That is not NSI-189 (the first link you gave).&nbsp; I&#039;m not seeing any mention of that specific compound on Thomson Reuters Pharma&#039;s or Neuralstem Inc.&#039;s press releases etc...&nbsp; nothing explicitly saying that this is the compound behind neurogenisis drug NSI-189... but I did find something else.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also of possible interest:<br />In related patent 7560553 I found: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Interestingly, chronic administration of either the antidepressant fluoxetine, an SSRI or the antidepressant rolipram, a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor, promoted neurogenesis in normal animals (Malberg et al., 2000; Nakagawa et al., 2002)&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; Why not start downing these?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see a patent listed for synthesis of NSI-189.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just not finding it, overlooking it perhaps... but my first guess is that they are keeping the info a proprietary secret.&nbsp; Yet at the same time, they aren&#039;t shy/have no qualms about publishing NSI-189&#039;s actual structure.&nbsp; &nbsp;What this tells me is that this probably isn&#039;t an easy synthesis... it&#039;s so difficult even, that they aren&#039;t worried about someone else filing the patent and stealing away it&#039;s rights... losing years and years worth of research/money.&nbsp; If they were worried, wouldn&#039;t it make sense that they file a patent explicitly on the drug (synthesis) itself?&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked for it to no avail.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s not even synthesized, just &quot;harvested&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you read through the patents associated with this research... until they start mass production of NSI-189 (if they ever do), your best bet is to basically eat brains.&nbsp; :o<br />Do what they did to look for the nootropic compounds...&nbsp; well, and maximize them.<br />-Raise rats<br />-Dose them up with SSRI&#039;s<br />-Keep them stress free and happy<br />-Kill them young<br />-Eat their brains <br /><br />You could also do this with other mammals... I&#039;m guessing human infant brains wold probably have the most amount of these compounds.&nbsp; Us being smarter than rats, bigger brains etc.&nbsp; Not only that, I imagine each mammal brain produces slightly different stuff (specific to that species)... just like it&#039;s healthier to drink human milk, it&#039;d probably be better to eat human brain if you didn&#039;t have to worry about cretzfeldt jakob disease (human version of mad cow disease).&nbsp; Yet I don&#039;t think prions/the cause of this disease are really understood... so I&#039;m not sure if cannibalism can be blamed by itself.&nbsp; Infants may be prion free.&nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creutzfeldt_Jakob_Disease#Transmission<br /><br />Really makes ya think.&nbsp; Maybe zombies aren&#039;t so stupid.&nbsp; Or those tales of ET&#039;s harvesting/eating humans brains etc., maybe they aren&#039;t so far fetched :) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
