				1) Create a contest :http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=154293.0<br />2) Limit who can be in it<br />3) Then abandon it and laugh about it and say you dont give a fuck when people start calling you out on it<br />4) Be a dick about it<br />5) Evade any reference to contest ever again<br />6) Repeat publicity stunt every time<br /><br />**UPDATE May 7th**:<br />After being confronted on several threads and evading the issue, Rxking said he will be &quot;be contacting you this week and telling you what you won. Again everything is my rules!&nbsp; ;D&quot; in an extremely bizarre explanation.<br /><br />As of May 7th, no &quot;winner&quot; has come forward, pretty much solidfying the obvious: it was bullshit to begin with and he never intended to have any winners. <br />Contacting the winners &quot;secretly&quot; is a trick he has used before during his early days as a vendor and claimed he will be contacting &quot;the first 10 customers&quot; of his and telling them &quot;they will have 10% off forever&quot; and that they will &quot;know it because they are going to receive a private message&quot;. So he is a profesionnal at bogus promises.<br /><br />Additionally, another member has come forward and put up a $500 dollar BITCOIN &quot;bet&quot; that if ANYONE claiming to have received a &quot;winning&quot; private message from Rxking regarding this contest, he will donate $500 dollars to either Silk Road or to the Silk Road Moderators as a sign of goodwill. As of right now NOBODY has come forward and Rxking is getting more agitated and hopeful that people don&#039;t see this debacle. Not a single customer has come forward claiming to have &quot;won&quot;. How can NOBODY have won? Very simple, nobody ever was going to &quot;win&quot;. It was all a desperate attempt for publicity.<br /><br />Additionally, 2 LONG STANDING VENDORS had predicted this would be Rxkings way to weasel out of his granstanding DAYS before Rxking tried to bury it. Two vendors had privately told a forum user that &quot;in the end Rxking will just fake out and babble some gibberish about contacting the winners and announing the winners privately just so he doesnt look stupid&quot;. <br /><br />I will keep updating this thread as more information comes in about this fraudulent man.<br />

YOU CANT STOP TALKING ABOUT ME... ;D<br /><br />But the best thing you said is I think I am god...yes I do.

NO ONE listens to you...and if you have not noticed...it is only you and your names that even comment besides me and a few others that are always telling you nothing you say makes sense.<br /><br />So I will not comment in any more threads you make with the name PissnNails,Oxyrotten, or Jesse.<br /><br />If you use other names I will still comment ;)

				As a neutral observer around here who usually lurks.. I&#039;ll say one thing. I was following this &#039;lottery&#039; (&#039;contest&#039;) thing that Rxking had announced and honesty thought it was pretty cool. Hes not one of my vendors.. but I&#039;ve seen him around. Although he mentions a lot of RX listings.. I&#039;ve only seen $850 for Bitcoin as a listing on his page. But again.. he might be in a stealth mode so that doesnt matter. he has great feedback, which cant be faked. <br /><br />regarding the contest though.. seemed like a great idea and sure had people worked up (shit I got excited just to see people win). but then he vanished.. and now has changed from his initial stance in his main thread and said &quot;its my thread my rules my contest i&#039;ll contact the winners this week&quot;. He is right it is his contest. But that seems like a major cop out.. he clearly said he was going to post the names of the winners and tie it in to teh Derby. He didnt do that. Then he said he was going to make a thread thee following day with the winners.. didn&#039;t do that. and then when people started pressing him to come forward about it.. he made some vague comments about he&#039;ll be contacting the winners this week and let them know privately. i think its quite obvious he realized he cant fulfillf such a contest (which DID sound too good to be true), or he backed out for whatever reasons. to say &quot;Im going to contact the winners this week and let the know&quot; is obvious attempt to wiggle out of it. how would anyone know if he contacted any winners? sounds like bullshit. in fact, he repeatedly said he was going to post the winners on the forum. but he&#039;s not going to do that.. and i think we all know why. thats pretty sad tho.<br /><br />i dont think it was a fake contest to begin with. i think it was real until he realized he didnt want to follow through with it/couldn&#039;t follow through with it. which is shitty. totally shitty.<br /><br />rxking : no disrespect to you.. but you realize why people are rolling their eyes about this? and this &quot;i will secretly contact the winners&quot; really makes no sense. now you will say im a shill account of someone else.. and i assure u im not. im just a silent spectator. but thats not cool. and like one of the other guys said, its obvious it was a publicity stunt of some sort that backfired. i was talking to a vendor through PM, who happens to be a long time poster here. he had told me a fe days ago (i wont reveal his name unless he wants me to) that he was certain you were going to back out and be vague about it when pressed, and eventually u were going to say &quot;Im just going to privately contact the winners and that the end of it&quot;. He predicted this and put a smiley face and said ANOTHER vendor had told him theres way u were for real about this and would find a way to back out of it..<br /><br />again.. no disrsspect.. thats not just my opinion..

				@JasonLeograndeHalesiteNY<br /><br />How I am even responding to this account name is ridiculous...but since you said what you did I will respond..<br /><br />&quot;no disrespect to you.. but you realize why people are rolling their eyes about this?&quot;<br /><br />So you said that....do you realize NO ONE is rolling there eye&#039;s?? Why don&#039;t you list ALL the names off all the people rolling there eyes.. you would have 3 names...and they would all be the same person. And for those names...not one is even in my contest! NOT ONE...Just one guy being an idiot.<br /><br /><br />You said this---<br /><br />&quot;but then he vanished.. and now has changed from his initial stance in his main thread and said &quot;its my thread my rules my contest i&#039;ll contact the winners this week&quot;<br /><br />Vanish???? How about I just didn&#039;t log into the forums! I know that is hard for some of you to believe but I am not in the forums 24/7.&nbsp; <br /><br />And when I left that message saying my contest my rules...I mean just that! I didnt change any thing..This was ALWAYS my contest and my rules! I never charged anyone any thing...I mean if I wanted to I could just say fuck off..I mean who would care? And those that did care...I could care less...But the facts are I am not doing that...so I just said that to say it...I mean do you even know how many people responded that were my actual customers? You should go look. Also do you see any of my customers complain? Talk shit? NOPE! Just these losers with names newer then yours.<br /><br /><br /><br />I could go on with points you made...but I just cant considering your account name and the fact you have 3 post.<br /><br />If a hero member has any question about the KING...they know how to contact me.<br /><br />I hope this clears up what you said for you.<br /><br />Also no offense taken :D<br /><br />(and all my listings are in stealth thanks)

If someone PM&#039;s me (and they can even CUSS at me, call me names) and just shows me proof that Rxking told them &quot;privately&quot; that they are a lucky winner and delivered, I will give $500 BTC to that person. Or I&#039;ll send $500 to Silk Road as a donation for them to upgrade their servers. Or I&#039;ll throw in $500 to a moderator fund. MARK MY WORDS. I will NOT back down from this. If ANYONE comes forward with proof that Rxking actually contacted them to make good on his contest, even if its anonymously, I will post on this forum that I was wrong, Rxking manned up, and I will give $500 in BTC to either Silk Road or the moderators or in someway donate it to help this place.<br /><br />Rxking - what say you?

				@ JasonLeograndeHalesiteNY<br /><br />Also so you know...I don&#039;t even think to vendors would talk to you...I mean maybe under your other name..but lets say they did...why would they care if I gave away shit or not? And why would I care if they did?&nbsp; So you know...I do not give a fuck. I didn&#039;t do this for other vendors..<br /><br />Also this contest was only open to the forum members that were on that day for the hours I said. That&#039;s it. And I was only doing it because SR was down..when in fact that very day it came back up... <br /><br />I am glad you care so much. And like I said earlier..NO ONE even cares about this except for my customers..and you do not see any of them on here... I mean why would anyone else care....it is not for them!<br /><br />Also you should name names if you are going to try and talk shit. I am not saying you are....but you should if you are going to try and make it look like all these people care... I promise NO OTHER VENDOR gives to fucks what I do....NONE!!!!

But what I was talking about was, through PM, 1 vendor whos been around for a LONG TIME.. literally predicted:<br /><br />&quot;He will come back.. change around his words.. and then eventually just say he&#039;s going to contact the winners secretly and privately. This is so that he can save face and get away without having to actually follow through with it. one of my boys said the same exact thing&quot;<br /><br />So I was pointing out that another person made a prediction about this privately (I don&#039;t think its right for me to put their name out.. since they are a vendor), but I can assure you it was a 100% prediction on what you did. Whats wrong with posting the winners names on the thread like was the plan all along and mentioned 4 times by YOU?

Or I&#039;ll send $500 to Silk Road as a donation for them to upgrade their servers. Or I&#039;ll throw in $500 to a moderator fund. MARK MY WORDS. I will NOT back down from this. If ANYONE comes forward with proof that Rxking actually contacted them to make good on his contest, even if its anonymously, I will post on this forum that I was wrong, Rxking manned up, and I will give $500 in BTC to either Silk Road or the moderators or in someway donate it to help this place.<br /><br />Rxking - what say you?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />LMAO....Now your in this name??????&nbsp; &nbsp;So funny...I love you use all these...<br /><br />Its amazing that all the same person is responding in here....<br /><br />And what I say to you is this.....<br /><br />Your offer is about as fake as all your names... I could care less what you say...I do not even think you have $5 let alone $500.<br /><br />And as I told you already...use another one of your names..

And why would I care if they did?&nbsp; So you know...I do not give a fuck. I didn&#039;t do this for other vendors..<br /><br />Also this contest was only open to the forum members that were on that day for the hours I said. That&#039;s it. And I was only doing it because SR was down..when in fact that very day it came back up... <br /><br />I am glad you care so much. And like I said earlier..NO ONE even cares about this except for my customers..and you do not see any of them on here... I mean why would anyone else care....it is not for them!<br /><br />Also you should name names if you are going to try and talk shit. I am not saying you are....but you should if you are going to try and make it look like all these people care... I promise NO OTHER VENDOR gives to fucks what I do....NONE!!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think you&#039;re not getting the point. I do talk to vendors under my Site name.. because I&#039;m a buyer and I have a good relationship with some of them. The reason we were even discussing your contest was, to be fair, I asked one of the vendors what his thoughts were on your giveaway/contest. And he just kind of laughed and said that it&#039;s just nonsense, and at the end you will say oh the site went back up, oh the rules have changed, etc.. but the end result will be that you are privately going to tell the winners they won. I was just pointing out that the guy was spot on in his prediction.. either he&#039;s pyschic.. or.. I dunno?<br />You do realize how it looks though right? As a major cop out? If people here thought vendors were doing contests like that and being a MAN OF THEIR WORD.. then it might inspire other vendors do hold similar events.. and genuinely bring the mood of this place up (u gotta admit last week SUCKED). So, I really don&#039;t mean to offend you man. Im not even a customer of yours. And the reason your customers are not complaining is because.. duh.. they all think theyre going to win? And they all think theyre going to get a secret message from you saying theyre the lucky winner. That&#039;s why. It&#039;s quite simple rxking. so obviously they will keep quiet to not ruin their chances. little do they know they&#039;re not going to win anything. (my opinion)<br /><br />I dont want to name the name of the person that made the prediction that you would end it with this silly &quot;the winners will now be secret and told secretly&quot;. He probably wont want to be seen as mocking another vendor. It was a private conversation. why not post up the winners/prizes publically? I understand its your rules, and if the reason you arent doing that is BECAUSE it&#039;s your rules then thats totally within your right. But then you cant fault others for laughing at this whole charade.<br /><br />Whistle blower - thats quite a challenge. So all it will take is 1 lucky customer to message you and ssay they were a winner and that rxking came through and u will just give up 500 dollars? damn. <br />Rxking - are u going to take him up on that? or &quot;no because i have nothing to prove&quot;?&nbsp; ;)

(I&#039;m just curious Im not being sarcastic).<br /><br />Whistleblowers challenge seems strange, but it does have a point. Kind of.

				I think it&#039;s fairly obvious that this contest was fake. And in every thread.. the RxKing just laughs it off and says &quot;NOBODY CARES BUT YOU! NOBODY CARES AT ALL! I DONT GIVE A FUCK! I&#039;m DONE WIHT THIS THREAD&quot; and just evades it. He wasnt planning on holding a real contest. As some other vendor predicted, he would end it with trying to be slick and say &quot;im going to alert the winners privately.. this week.. and tell them they won&quot; BUT I DONT CARE WHAT U THINK&quot;. This was predicted, this has happened. No winners have come forward. Whiste Blower has said he will donate $500 to Silk Road if ANYBODY comes forward and proves him wrong and says Rxking has told them theyre a winner. To my knowledge.. nobody came forward. To my knowledge it was just a bad joke. But, that is RXkings right.. I mean its HIS product/btc. He can give them away or hold raffles or do whatever he wants. But to continually lie and evade and posture and avoid having to come out with it.. is a rotten thing to do.<br /><br />Moderators - what is your opinion on this? And your opinion that Rxking finally wiggled out of it by saying &quot;im going to tell the winners secretly&quot;. Scout, Libertas, what is your opinion :)<br /><br />Whistel Blower- does your challenge still stand to donate $500 to Silk Road if any winner comes forward?<br /><br />Customers of RxKing who were on Rxkings contest thread - Were you at all contacted that you were either a contestant or a winner? At any time?<br /><br />Silk Road forum community - What are your thoughts on this &quot;i will contact the winners secretly&quot; cop out?<br /><br />Silk Road Vendors - What are your thoughts on this contest and the fact that it was obviously a giant stunt? Would you guys do the same? (I already know the opinion of 2 vendors. 1 predicted this to a TEE, while another apparently laughed it off and said he had no comment but it would be obvious in a few days what the purpose was.. seems like he was right. )<br /><br />Rxking - Have you contacted any of your customers/winners about this contest and awarded them any prize?

				My offer stands. Silk Road, listen up. If ANY WINNER OF RXKINGS obviously, laughably, fake contest comes forward and claims they were told they were a winner and were awarded any price.. I WILL IMMEDIATELY DONATE $5000 IN BITCOIN TO SILK ROAD. I WILL GIVE IT TO EITHER A MODERATOR FUND, or ANY OFFICIAL SILK ROAD WALLET. I WILL PROVIDE THE TRANSACTION ID/THE WALLET I SENT IT FROM PUBLICALLY HERE ON THE FORUM SO THAT EVERYONE CAN VERIFY ON THE BLOCKCHAIN I HONORED MY CHALLENGE.<br /><br />My offer stands. I am a man of my word. $500 to either the moderators or Silk Road if ANY customer comes forward and validates Rxking&#039;s claim he told them secretly they were winners. <br /><br />This is an OPEN LETTER to the entire community. I think Silk Road and/or the moderators deserve $500, right?<br /><br />modz - Which is the official silk road wallet that donations are accepted? If there is none.. please provide me with YOUR Moderator wallet.<br /><br />Lets see this publicity seeking fake, shady, bullshitter follow through with his promise. Whats he got to lose? This is essentially a WIN WIN situation for Silk Road. I will give them $500 for free as a donation if its proven RxKing was telling the truth. Come on winners.. just 1 of you come forward. Fuck it dont even come forward.. PM me and I&#039;ll take that as proof.<br /><br />Waiting, clock is ticking......

As Predicted by other senior vendors, he would slither out of it like that. EXACTLY what he said. You must feel fucking retarded now Mr Aston! PWNED!<br /><br />**UPDATE May 7th*******************************:<br />After being confronted on several threads and evading the issue, Rxking said he will be &quot;be contacting you this week and telling you what you won. Again everything is my rules!&nbsp; ;D&quot; in an extremely bizarre explanation.<br /><br />As of May 7th, no &quot;winner&quot; has come forward, pretty much solidfying the obvious: it was bullshit to begin with and he never intended to have any winners. <br />Contacting the winners &quot;secretly&quot; is a trick he has used before during his early days as a vendor and claimed he will be contacting &quot;the first 10 customers&quot; of his and telling them &quot;they will have 10% off forever&quot; and that they will &quot;know it because they are going to receive a private message&quot;. So he is a profesionnal at bogus promises.<br /><br />Additionally, another member has come forward and put up a $500 dollar BITCOIN &quot;bet&quot; that if ANYONE claiming to have received a &quot;winning&quot; private message from Rxking regarding this contest, he will donate $500 dollars to either Silk Road or to the Silk Road Moderators as a sign of goodwill. As of right now NOBODY has come forward and Rxking is getting more agitated and hopeful that people don&#039;t see this debacle. Not a single customer has come forward claiming to have &quot;won&quot;. How can NOBODY have won? Very simple, nobody ever was going to &quot;win&quot;. It was all a desperate attempt for publicity.<br /><br />Additionally, 2 LONG STANDING VENDORS had predicted this would be Rxkings way to weasel out of his granstanding DAYS before Rxking tried to bury it. Two vendors had privately told a forum user that &quot;in the end Rxking will just fake out and babble some gibberish about contacting the winners and announing the winners privately just so he doesnt look stupid&quot;. <br /><br />I will keep updating this thread as more information comes in about this fraudulent man.<br />

				Personally I think all those raffles and contests etc are total bullshit. No-one ever wins.<br />Noobs are sometimes forced to buy raffle tickets at the start of their SR adventures,&nbsp; in order to pump up their stats to a place where Vendors won&#039;t ask for FE.<br />Other than that, I see no real purpose in them.

I&#039;m shocked some of you people actually thought this man was credible with his &quot;Free Drugs and BTC giveaway&quot; nonsense. I could have told you it was just a plea for attention. There were a few desperate chearleaders on that thread falling over backwards to defend their beloved King. And boy are they in for a letdown. <br /><br />&quot;for those who won, I will contact you this week to let you know that you won&quot; is the most hilarious attempt to back out and cop out. To think anyone will buy that is amusing. Why he wont announce the &quot;winners&quot; publically? Very simple.. because nobody won. He just doesn&#039;t have the decency or guts to admit it. Instead he thinks he&#039;s slick and will get away with &quot;I told the winners privately that they won AND THEY KNOW THAT IM THE KING! AND I HAVE PERFECT FEEDBACK! AND I HAVE 500 CUSTOMERS!&quot; He will get loud and hem and haw, but will never announce any winners.

I&#039;m offering $500 dollars in BTC to ANYONE who comes forward (even ANONYMOUSLY) and PM&#039;s me and says they &quot;won&quot; anything from Rxkings little sham contest. If someone PM&#039;s me (and they can even CUSS at me, call me names) and just shows me proof that Rxking told them &quot;privately&quot; that they are a lucky winner and delivered, I will give $500 BTC to that person. Or I&#039;ll send $500 to Silk Road as a donation for them to upgrade their servers. Or I&#039;ll throw in $500 to a moderator fund. MARK MY WORDS. I will NOT back down from this. If ANYONE comes forward with proof that Rxking actually contacted them to make good on his contest, even if its anonymously, I will post on this forum that I was wrong, Rxking manned up, and I will give $500 in BTC to either Silk Road or the moderators or in someway donate it to help this place.<br /><br />Rxking - what say you?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>WHAT THE HELL....I PUT 200 DOLLAR ON TOP OF THAT!!<br />He might get his two buddies Blackcolor and Southpaw to say that they won but....they were on the topic to much defending him to make that believable.<br />HE HAS TO NAME ALL THE WINNERS or go down the SR history as a fraudulent megalomaniac.

How come? Are the winners imaginary? You aren&#039;t a man of your word. And your attempts to say &quot;NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY CONTEST&quot; is a the sign of a desperate, delirious, liar who knows that now.. whenever ANYONE searches his name in the forums.. all these threads will pop up about how you perpertrated a fraudulent contest just to stroke your own ego and people (and yes people, not ONLY TWO PEOPLE that you keep barking) think it&#039;s hilarious. If i showed you the private messages going around about this situation.. true.. a lot of people think its not important, (which its not), but nearly everyone laughs and says wow, what a fake ass bitch.<br /><br />$700 dollars to ANYONE who comes forward and says that you contacted them about &quot;winning&quot; anything. Nobody. Not a single person. You&#039;d think someone would do it to make &quot;us&quot; look stupid, you look honest, and Silk Road gets $700. You&#039;d think SOMEONE would come forward. But nobody has. Why? Answer that question, why? I contacted a few of your most ardent ass kissers from your contest thread and point blank asked if RxKing contacted them AT ALL about the &quot;contest&quot;.. and guess what? No answer. Why? Because they&#039;re embarrased they were defending a fraud like you.<br /><br />And now, more creative threads will be created with your name in the subject (just so anyone who EVER searches for Rxking) will see what you really are and be overwhelmed and think you&#039;re a piece of shit.<br /><br />Fradulent asian. (and yes people, read Rxking posts. He talks like an angry chinaman.)<br /><br />$700 bucks on the table. Answer the question Rxking.

				Ok, you people have obviously lost your fucking mind. I&#039;m going to say this and I&#039;m going to say it just once. Prepare your $700 or whatever else absurd &quot;donation&quot; you fags have wagered and immediately donate it to Silk Road. And provide us all with the wallet so we can watch it on the blockchain.<br />I&#039;m not going to get into specifics because it&#039;s really none of your fucking business, but I can ABSOLUTELY VOUCHE for the VALIDITY of RxKing&#039;s honoring his contest commitment. Absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt he has kept his word and did not fake out or any other bullshit. I am vouching. He spoke to me, and the contents of that discussion is NONE OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS, but needless to say I am vouching that he has made good on his word. Not that I, nor he, nor any of his other customers have to really explain this on a public newbie forum. I am NOT Rxking, I am a totally different person, who has no reason to lie or cover or anything. I am publically vouching for this. This contest was not &quot;fake&quot; or a &quot;scam&quot;. In fact calling a vendor a scammer is quite a serious offense and I hope someone takes notice of this. Calling a vendor a scammer without proof is serious FUD and is not good for Silk Road as a marketplace.<br /><br />All of you stalking ass motherfuckers, I am not aware of the whole backstory, and I am struggling to understand what your obsession with RxKing is.. but I am openly vouching that he has come through with his promise to contact the winners. Please pay your hilarious $700 bounty ASAP and show us proof that YOU paid it.<br /><br />Case closed bitter little bitches.

				THE ONLY FACTS YOU WILL EVER READ IN THESE SHITTY POST!<br /><br /><br />I love that you &quot;JESSE&quot;, who is actually the vendor Jacky is keeping my name is lights! I love that for no other reason then jealousy and you being very envious of RxKing that you keep trying to rattle off these stupid post that no one cares about and NO ONE takes your side! LOL...They all AGREE with the RxKING! Now Lets go over who all the members are! <br /><br />I mean you(being jesse,aka cancerJackythevendor) have told me &quot;a lot of people care&quot; lol...Lets go over it and see how great of members these people that care so much are!<br /><br />Oxyrotten--- Well this fine name was created...wait for it....May 4th!!! LOL..And it just so happens ALL of his post were made just in these threads about my give away. And of course this name sent me a message on SR trying to get into my giveaway, Of course it was a day after it it ended&nbsp; and he was never ever a customer of mine! I mean how could he be!! He was created AFTER the give away ended...When I told him &quot; how fucking stupid are you? did you read where is said &quot;RxKings customers only? he just said &quot;oh&quot; and went away...and wouldn&#039;t you know...this is the name that started all these threads...SO he is not a buyer, So I piss on him! HE is not even a real person..I mean he is YOU.<br /><br />Jesse-- This one is great. When you were still acting like you were nothing more then Jesse in the forums, I found out you claim you had cancer. So I said something to you about cancer and your response was&quot; Well you must be a physic because I am really healthy&quot; LOL...Like I have always said...YOU ARE REALLY FUCKING STUPID!...SO then I OUTED YOU AS IN FACT THE VENDOR JACKY! THAT HAS BEEN A VENDOR FOR 1 YEAR. A SMALL SHITTY ONE THAT BARLEY SELLS THE DRUGS HE STEALS. But he does have a 100 score and so that is good. Cant say anything bad about his vending..you can about everything else..just not his vending. But again he barley sells anything at all. And when this whole thing started...he came into the thread complaining that I should be banned for wishing someone dead!( I told you he was stupid) SO I then wished HIM, JACKY DEAD! After all...on his vendor page it says he had cancer and that&#039;s why he gets the meds. He has since told us all, that he gets all his meds for free and so he sells them on SR to make money. Real good guy (except the total opposite) No wonder God gave him cancer!<br /><br />Just still cant figure out why he jocks me so much? Clearly he is infatuated by me He makes all these silly threads saying the same thing over and over again, then he creates names so that he can comment on his OWN threads!! What a LOSER!!. NO REAL MEMBERS CARE ABOUT THIS AT ALL...BUT HE REALLY DOES! And he loves me the KING of course!! But still for&nbsp; another vendor to be such a liar like him is a bad thing..Hopefully he is gone in less then 6 months...<br /><br />Jackoxy-- A name created on May 5th. Again by &quot;Jesse&quot;/&quot;oxyrotten&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;So of course this name is not a real forum member...it was created my Jesse to just make these stupid post. The beauty is that jackoxy could never be in my give away and therefor should not care! But Jesse needed names to make it look like people were commenting!&nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#039;t work as I exposed him.<br /><br />I exposed him in this thread---http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155875.30<br /><br />Jesse then went on to create this stupid thread as when he got exposed he runs and hides and creates new user names...THEN HE RAN OFF AND CREATED THIS THREAD AS HE HAD NO ANSWERS FOR THE TRUTH...I MEAN LOOK FOR YOURSELF...HE HAS 90% OF THE POST...BUT MINE IS THE LAST ONE..BECAUSE I EXPOSED HIM AS A FRAUD VENDOR..JACKY THE FRAUD VENDOR. LOOK AT THE TIME OF THIS POST...HE IS SO STUPID HE WILL GO POST IN IT NOW...LOL..BUT THE PROOF IS ALREADY THERE! AND IF HE DOES POST WE WILL NOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS..HE WILL JUST SAY HIS STUPID SHIT<br /><br />Whistleblower---Now this name was created about a month ago..to supposedly make these big announcements.. Of course NOTHING WAS EVER EXPOSED and NO WHISTLES were blown...LOL ... So again this is not a real member. Just an account created by...I do not want to say JESSE....so lets just go by some other idiot..really makes no difference..as he just came in and offered a fake $500 if a winner comes forward. Again this is totally FAKE as there is no $500(just like there was no whistle blown...all talk..no action ...these guys are just really stupid and think people care...NO ONE DOES...but to his defense he has only recently entered the fray and because he lacks any credibility at all...no one even thinks of him. But if he was real, he would post the 5 btc with the MOD SCOUT! That is the only way he is legit...and everyone knows he will never do that.<br /><br />Color black--- is a legit buyer....and he of course see&#039;s JeSse is just an IDIOT and made up the other names.<br /><br />JasonLeograndeHalesiteNY---all there is to say about this name is LOL..But yes his name is 3 days old!<br /><br />So the pattern you are seeing is this--Oxrotten(created by Jesse may 5th) starts the thread, Jesse comments,&nbsp; Jackoxy(created by Jesse May 4th), oh and &quot;Jesse&quot; is actually the vendor &quot;Jacky&quot;. So Jesse uses all these names in these threads only to make it look like someone cares!! LMAO..I have said many a time..NO ONE DOES...<br /><br />Also you will see that non of my customers have came and complained. NOPE. Just 4 names created by 1 vendor! How sad is that. That is sadder then getting cancer. The worst part is he lived. Poor world.<br /><br />So you can clearly see that I have EXPOSED this Wanabee cacner lover for who he is...A Rat! And an overall total loser. <br /><br />And I know that I should not even waste my time as NO real forum members care at all BUT I like to mess with fans! I like to expose LIARS like PERKY! <br /><br />In fact a well respected HERO MEMBER did come into the thread....and BASHED &quot;Jesse&quot; and THANKED me for exposing this NUT JOB. <br /><br />Just think of all the time &quot;Jesse/jackoxy,jacky/oxyrotten have wasted with this! I mean I am truly flattered that a fan would spend this much time on something that No real member cares about. In fact many a time it is just Jesse posting..like 3 or 4 in a row...then he has to go to his other names to post in this thread...and STILL no one cares!!&nbsp; I post in it to keep my name in the lights and&nbsp; to embarrass Jesse. I mean Jacky.<br /><br />Now of course &quot;Jesse&quot; is going to say that none of these names are him...Ok..We will go with that lie...so then what you are saying Jesse...is that 3 newbies created accounts and all the care about is this giveaway that they were not in????? LOL...Ok...we will go with that!<br /><br />All you have done is showed what a total loser and liar you are. And that you are a person that needs multiple forum accounts because you say so much stupid shit. In fact you are the ONLY vendor that has been here a year that has multiple accounts in the forum and does not have access to the vendor only forum! You should try and get in to see what is said about you..(not good)<br /><br />Also as a vendor you should only have 1 forum account. Vendors do not need more then 1. You should be accountable for what you say, good or bad and stand behind it! Not say shit and then lie and act different because no one knows who you really are. Just one of the many things that makes you scum. You really need to STOP lying. I know you cent stop in your country. And I know you do not care because when you take the free drugs in your country you are not taking them from another patient. You are just lying to the government...No one will care about that in here. But it does show yr character and what a horrible person you are! To have had cancer before and to go into remission but then still lie so that you can get the drugs and then brag about getting free drugs but still charging 230+ for 3 little pills shows what a fucking&nbsp; scum bag you are! <br /><br />What they say in our GREAT COUNTRY is what go&#039;s around comes around. And you have BAD KARMA...so it is like 100% you will get cancer again. But there is a chance you were lying about it all! I mean that is your MO. SO in that case, I will then hope you get it for the fist time! or better yet just a bad auto accident. Like your bike being hit by a car...Since you do not own a car!<br /><br />Now you did make another thread asking the mods if I did anything wrong...because you were to stupid to figure out I can give away what ever i want...and of course the MOD said he was not touching it with&nbsp; a 10ft pole. And you of course spun his answer. BUT I have an idea...<br /><br />Now it is still a mystery why you care about me so much and what I give away...But since we know the $500 was a fake offer....You say $200 is your offer...and of course I KNOW it is fake...but I am giving you a chance to come clean...And since you make so much money, 200 is nothing to you...so you POST...that means to send the..lets call it 2 btc...to the MOD&nbsp; SCOUT!&nbsp; Then what I will do is give scout 4 coins to hold! If a winner does not come through...you can have my 4 coins...and that is like a big week for you! So this is a lot better then your shit fake proposal..where all you wanted to do was give 200 on top of the 500 that another fake person posted. and you too idiots thought that was so much money that for&nbsp; that would spark interest. Well of course it didn&#039;t as no one cares...but this way you can out up or shut up..Show us all how legit you are..<br /><br />So keep your word(you never have so this should be fun) and give 2 btc to the MOD Scout...and I will double that!!! And if there is not a winner...you get the coins...if there is a winner...I of course will not take the 2 coins..I will let Scout have them!!!<br /><br />So step up..I know you will not address&nbsp; the facts in this message... but you cant hide from your 200 you promised. But since your word is NO GOOD..You need to put up the money with a TRUSTED MODERATOR!!!<br /><br />So I know you will not do that. Just like I have shown that &quot;all these so called members are YOU&quot; and no one cares...Just please keep them going...they are working so well for you.<br /><br />Idiot!&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope you lost a few pounds the last 2 days...<br />

You girls are the weakest shit I&#039;ve seen on these forums in a long long time. I must say that you cunts don&#039;t have a clue what is going on and that&#039;s good because if you did the compliance won&#039;t be here. Caauuuse that&#039;s how you vindictive hoes are. You have to be duped into this shit to think it&#039;s your own free will causing you to post and post lies that make you feel better about your worthless wrenched ass lives. Shame really.. <br /><br />Jesse dear your up!
