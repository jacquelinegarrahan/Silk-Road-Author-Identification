				A strange, but delightful mixture I discovered a few years ago was raw DXM hBR powder (600~ mg) with a few geltabs of LSD. My friends and I dubbed it &quot;see-sawing&quot;, the experience was such that it was difficult to tell what substance you were on, rather than an obvious perceptual interplay. One second you&#039;d be riding 3P dissociative vibes with immense CEVs and then another, very strange, OEB lysergic bliss. Some of the most potent visuals I&#039;ve had, including seeing myself via a fisheye lens from behind as I walked down some stairs, then watching my friend bend iron bars apart and crawl through them. Another, more current favorite, is K and Molly. I almost refuse to do them separately at this point.
