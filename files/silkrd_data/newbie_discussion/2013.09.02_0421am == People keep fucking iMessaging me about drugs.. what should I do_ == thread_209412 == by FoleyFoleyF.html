				I&#039;m getting really nervous guys. Keep getting SMS and imessages about drugs from friends and people I know. I always respond that I don&#039;t know anything about it, of course, but fucking idiots won&#039;t stop. I always catch up to them and make them delete the messages, but is that enough? Should I look into getting another phone?<br /><br />Help!

				Do not tell anyone you order from sr. <br /><br />If you want to be safe, don&#039;t let anyone know you can get drugs at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want to become a dealer figure out a business model first. Learn some security.

				If you don&#039;t want to sell them drugs, tell them to fuck off. <br /><br />If you do want to sell drugs, yah you should get a separate phone.&nbsp; And a business plan.

				An alternative to working over the phone is getting them set up with PGP software. Call it &#039;fun spy games&#039;, hopefully that&#039;ll convince them to stop using plain text.

				Can&#039;t you buy track phones at gas stations these days?&nbsp; I really don&#039;t know to be honest, I don&#039;t ever talk about drugs over phone.&nbsp; If I do have to I&#039;ll call not text.<br /><br />Hardly any of my friends use these days, and most of them don&#039;t know that I do. <br />

				I&#039;ve found that telling people who do this to fuck off works pretty efficiently. if they&#039;re using sms or imessage to ask about drugs, they have no sense of security, and shouldn&#039;t be associated with.

				I think a healthy return of goatse (maybe as an autoreply?) would be in order.&nbsp; That&#039;s usually enough to dissuade anyone of just about anything.

				Ya unfortunately people aren&#039;t as concerned as security as they often should be. Even when it&#039;s not about drugs it should be on their mind!<br /><br />It&#039;s up to us roaders to inform! Starting by telling people like that to Fuck Off haha
