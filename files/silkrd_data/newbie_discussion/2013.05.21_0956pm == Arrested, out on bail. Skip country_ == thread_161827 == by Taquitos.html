				I can&#039;t say where I live and I can&#039;t talk much about it, but I can give a few details. I got into a bit of trouble recently and I&#039;m looking at multiple felonies and 20+ years jail time. My lawyer says there&#039;s not much that can be done. Too much evidence. I wasn&#039;t too worried about it because I had a few BTC saved up to skip the country just in case this happened, but my OWN BROTHER ratted me out. I lost all of my BTC wallets but one (and I had my sister chance it to USD to bail me out... only .000274 BTC left, haha. Not nearly enough to skip!), I lost my computers, all of my money and drugs, everything. My brother is the ONLY person I told. I&#039;m still in shock over him ratting me out.<br /><br />No clue what to do at this point. I have a little bit of money left, a couple hundred dollars that I borrowed from my sister, but that&#039;s it. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s enough to skip the country. I&#039;m only in my early 20s, I can&#039;t go to jail for that long. I&#039;d rather run for the rest of my life. <br /><br />But... what should I do? Any advice? I do live in America, so I&#039;d probably skip to Canada or Mexico first... I&#039;m not sure. Ugh! I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m just really stressed and depressed right now. My entire life is ruined at this point over some stupid drugs. I&#039;m very sick, I can&#039;t walk properly (I have to use muscle relaxers, mainly diazepam, to walk... my leg is wrecked) so I have to use a cane permanently. <br /><br />I... I really have no idea what to do. I guess, mostly, what I&#039;m looking for, is someone to talk to about it. I can&#039;t think of anyone else. I&#039;ve been here for years, but I can&#039;t use my SR accounts anymore... (No, my seller account isn&#039;t being used... don&#039;t worry. That one wasn&#039;t found).<br /><br />Well, hope to find some advice possibly... Thanks, everyone. I&#039;ll spam to 50 posts eventually and post this in a different forum if nobody sees it here.<br /><br />Wish me luck. Court is in two weeks, then I go to jail forever... unless I run?

				I think running will probably be a bad choice. Think of the bullshit you&#039;ll have to deal with going underground.&nbsp; Hopefully this insane prohibition bullshit will start to fall apart and you can get out much sooner. I&#039;m hoping you dodge a bullet and you get a better deal..

				Chances of dodging a bullet is nil. Not gonna happen. I had too much shit on me, which is BEYOND frustrating, since I was getting rid of EVERYTHING in two weeks... and then my brother snitches. Freakishly annoying. <br /><br />I&#039;m staying at a really cheap $20 a night motel right now. I can&#039;t go to jail for that long. I&#039;m 23, I&#039;ll be over 40 when I get out, and even if the prohibition changes... the fact that I had as much on me as I did, they&#039;ll never let me out early.<br /><br />That will ruin me. I cannot go. I would much rather be free and on the underground than locked up in a federal prison for the rest of my life...

Hitchhiking might be better, though...<br /><br />@martin<br /><br />I think there is, but I&#039;m not sure if it is valid for this... I already was arrested. I was in jail for a month and I finally got out on bail. If I skip, I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d go back to jail regardless of the amount of time passed.

				Quite a lot. Three lbs of marijuana, 50 plants, 100g of heroin, and a little cocaine. I sold mostly heroin and marijuana. I started really small and eventually got pretty big. I never was even LOOKED at until my brother said something. We were so close too, I just don&#039;t understand...<br /><br />It sorta sucks. This was pretty much the only thing I could do, being severely disabled (it&#039;s either this or SSI, and I don&#039;t want to take money from taxpayers like that). And now I have nothinggg. Heh. You go from being pretty damn comfortable one day to sitting in a jail cell another. And now I&#039;m in a shitty motel (seen three cockroaches already...) waiting for the perfect time to skip to Canada, and trying to gather up as much money as possible. No luck yet. Wish me some! :D<br /><br />@Jack N Hoff<br />My brother knew the information for that account and the password to some of my BTC wallets. He didn&#039;t know the one used to bail me out though.

				that is pretty fucked up on one hand , but on the other thats ALOT of drugs. Whatever your story is, I would never try to run from the police, especially if you are scrounging for money. You will absolutely get more time for running than you will for just going though with it like you should. <br /><br />If you think you wont get caught, I would advise that you reallly think about what it involves to &quot;go underground&quot; and make sure that you can actually accomplish it. otherwise you are wasting time you could spend on &quot;good behavior&quot; and extending the eventual fate of prosecution. <br /><br />

				It was a lot of drugs, but you need a lot of drugs to meet the demand on SR. I haven&#039;t sold on the streets, I haven&#039;t committed any violent acts, I haven&#039;t scammed, and I did reships (for free) or a 100% refund if the package doesn&#039;t arrive. It&#039;s a lot of drugs, but when you have a lot of buyers... you need a lot of drugs.<br /><br />I even donate money to charity, haha. It&#039;s just so ironic. I&#039;m a good person in almost every way, except the drugs, and my entire life is gone because of it.<br /><br />I know what going underground entails. I was prepared for it in case anything happened, but clearly I didn&#039;t plan for this. I&#039;d much rather have even just one more year free and then off myself before going to jail than go to jail now... I&#039;m just glad I didn&#039;t start synthesizing LSD like I planned on doing, haha. Glad I stuck to heroin...<br /><br />If I had all the precursors and LSD on me as well, I&#039;d have an even bigger rap sheet. I&#039;m just so screwed. I&#039;d rather prostitute on the streets for money than go to jail.

				OMG! Your brother sounds like a real DICK! or at least he turned into one.<br />I would probably do what other people are saying and get to canada.<br />Given the amount of funds you seem to have its the best bet.<br />Have you already spoke with a good lawyer and know the best possible outcome?<br />Good luck in your journey.I&#039;m praying for you.

				Wow! That&#039;s crazy shit.. I guess I&#039;d try to run away to Canada and then from there to someplace else... Actually I think I would never be able to stop in only one place...

I rarely use heroin, I mostly smoke weed, but he used it a lot. I think he was mad at the fact that I was getting out of the game and wouldn&#039;t have access to free heroin anymore... <br /><br />Insane what these crazy &quot;junkies&quot; can do for their dope. =/ Just get a job and buy your shit on SR like the rest of us, or learn to synthesize shit yourself like I did, or grow your own weed... I dunno. It&#039;s frustrating having to deal with fuckers like this, and your own FLESH AND BLOOD. It&#039;s mind-boggling.

Better than prostituting myself out to crazy ass dirty Americans/Canadians... I&#039;m pretty young too! ;D<br /><br />Yeah, I had quite a lot. I turned it into a huge business and I made quite a lot of money, and I was preparing to get out and live life on the side of good for a while (though still obviously buying LSD and whatnot from here). So hilarious. I had buyers for all of my marijuana (legitimate dispensaries) and I know someone I could pass the heroin off to to sell for a little bit of a loss, but not enough to even dent the bank. <br /><br />And yeah, you&#039;d think murdering someone or raping a little could would be a little worse than supplying something for people who simply want to change how THEIR OWN bodies feel. So fucking silly...<br /><br />I just hope I can find some way to get back into the business in Canada and make a little bit of money before stopping again. This time, I trust NOBODY in real life. Ugh.

				Taquitos, run for your life, damn its a quarter lifetime you would have to spend in jail.... I feel highly pity for you, I know it won&#039;t help you if I say it, but don&#039;t give up and for real dont prostitute yourself.<br />I have no clue how it is going to be for you being on the run, but I think it&#039;s not going to be too nice from what I read here (issues with the leg + the precursors you took). But just don&#039;t give up. Maybe you can make it out of the US and find a normal job. Since you apparently were making the drugs yourself you don&#039;t seem to be a dumb one. A job should be the last problem for you.<br />Good luck with your upcoming journey and lots of luck.

Didn&#039;t ruin me, simply the effects of it on another person affected me. *shrug*<br /><br />People are just assholes sometimes. Frustrating, but whatever. I&#039;ll miss my sister as she was my best friend, but in 2~3 years I&#039;ll contact her. <br /><br />@DragonJr<br /><br />Never. 20+ years in prison? Hell no. I would DIE.

				&nbsp;I would advise not to go to Canada. Canada LE work closely with the US LE and basically will do whatever is asked of them. You will be hardly any safer their than in the US. If you can go to Mexico. Grow your hair long, dye it, grow a beard, gain some weight or lose weight w/e you need to do to disguise yourself. <br /><br />BUT BEFORE YOU GO STAB THAT DICKHEAD OF A BROTHER YOU HAVE AND THEN FLEE. Not a fatal stabbing just like a &#039;hey fuck you scumbag&#039; kinda stabbing. Keep this in mind though if you run and they catch you there&#039;s a good chance you might not get out till you&#039;re 60. Seriously think about what you&#039;re doing. If you&#039;re comfortable with the risks I&#039;d say go to Mexico. This may be a dumb question but as&nbsp; big time vendor did you have a contigency plan just in case things went to shit? Like fake passports, id&#039;s stuff like that? If not can you get access to one now? Man that really sucks I feel for you, wish you the best luck!

				Why perpetuate a cycle of violence? What long-term satisfaction do you get from knowing you met wrong with wrong? Her brother has his own sins to dwell on. <br /><br />Although getting caught by Canadian LE will be just as bad as getting caught by American, I can&#039;t help but feel Canada will be a more hospitable country survival-wise. Not to mention the border is not as heavily guarded (by LE or by redneck &#039;Murrican patriot posses). A benefit to Mexico is access to a whole other continent by land, but I don&#039;t know how a gringo girl would fare down there. Although I&#039;ve never planned to skip the country and am thus limited in my knowledge, I live in Canada and have spent some time learning bushcraft should the time ever strike me to withdraw from this great society for a bit. Thankfully we have some pretty hospitable forests (bring a warm jacket! ;)), and with a clean nose there&#039;s no reason to get picked out by LE in the cities.

				Tru..Goodpoint..I thought OP was a guy..hmmm ya a gringo girl in Mexico might be tough. Ok if Canada is the destination then I&#039;d advise once you cross get as far way from the border as possible. Ya Mexico might be a bad idea then.<br /><br />The border is heavily monitiored but only if your not from that country. Mostly coming into the US if you are not a US citzen they drill you. Going into Canada if you do it before US LE get a chance to put out a warrant and let everyone know including the border patrol you should be good to cross. But that&#039;s it you can never come back, call or write home. Just trying to help as don&#039;t wanna see someone waste their life in jail.

				Yeah, Mexico would be quite bad for me. :/<br /><br />@NewStem<br /><br />Yeah, I was actually planning on documenting all of this. Maybe make a little how-to guide (hah!).

Gotta find one of them though... hah.<br /><br />Thanks for the luck. I likely still will use heroin every once in a while (probably not for the next 4+ months). I&#039;ve been using it for a long time now and I have never had an addiction problem. I rarely use it more than a couple times a month. I&#039;ve never been through opiate withdrawals.

				Don&#039;t kill your brother, that will just make things worse. Buy a dirty AIDS needle from some junkie and stab him in the face with it. Give him HIV, make him die slowly and painfully. No dope fiend will have medical insurance. As for running, why go to Canada? The obvious choice would be south America, go to Mexico. From there you can go to Costa Rica, Panama, their law enforcement has to be far less efficient than Canada&#039;s. <br /><br />Canada is a pretty bad choice for avoiding US law enforcement, they aren&#039;t just going to forget about you with that amount of drugs. They will issue a warrant, and you will get extradited. Think about the long term, where is best to hide and avoid extradition? Can you jump across a land border, then lay low until you have the funds to fly some place that has no extradition treaties with the USA? Think long and hard about everything, make the right choice.<br /><br />Sorry this happened, but I have no sympathy for you. Heroin is a very destructive drug. You had massive quantities of narcotics and must have known the consequences, you decided to take that risk. Whatever happens, delete your forum account and this thread (especially if you go to Canada), it will do nothing but provide evidence to help catch you.

				&nbsp;wonder if SR would ever be able to come up with a system to let vendors /buyers buy insurance.In case of emergency&nbsp; like these but you would have to prove doc an everything to DPR... Dont know what price it would be or even if it could be done. What do you all think. It should not be that expensve to buy if they would allow cause very few people get busted unless you have super bad luck like your brother ratting on you.<br />I deeply feel for you. I know that must be a terrible thing to be going though an all for just drugs. its a stupid war they will never win. just spending tons of money on it. What a waste you probably have never been in trouble in your life. Now this.<br />You will make it out of this some how....i wish the best for you.....hook up with sugar daddy in a far off foreign country. Like someone mentioned earlier....just never till that person your secret. an find a place with no extradition treaty.

In my country at least I could obtain a few thousand, through several small loan companies that require no real background check (certainly no criminal checks). Personally I am on police bail myself right now and I will be going to prison shortly; I even kept my passport. The police aren&#039;t going to be monitoring this woman when she is on bail, I really doubt it anyway. They can&#039;t keep tabs on everyone pending a jail sentence to the extent you&#039;re imagining.

The most notable was the bust of Canadian vendor, MoveItNice. He supplied some bad ass Coke for a while before mistakenly accepting payments through Western Union for some larger orders, driving the final nail into his coffin so to speak. He was eventually busted with over 500 grams of Coke at his families home and Police also seized over 200 grams in packages from the Post Office, all packaged up and ready to be shipped out world wide. God I miss MIN&#039;s Coke.
