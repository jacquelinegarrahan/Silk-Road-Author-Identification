				got a question here,<br />&nbsp;Is it ok that I&#039;ll place a couple of orders at the same time on SilkRoad?<br />I mean, to add to my cart like 3 or 4 products while all of them, each one is from a different vendor<br />

				Yep. But you should note that all these orders will be sent to single address and ( I don&#039;t know if it matters) during same time period.<br />So if you use multiple addresses or if you want to add a specific comment for some orders, you&#039;d order them apart.

				why wouldnt it be?&nbsp; unless youre paranoid about it all showing up at once and the postman asking questions.&nbsp; but if u get regular deliveried to your house (which i do) then your UPS/USPS man doesnt bat an eye when delivering packages on almost a daily basis lol

				I often have multiple orders on their way to me, usually same product from different vendors. I always give each vendor a number to mark on the package, so I can keep track of what came from where and leave the right feedback.

				Yeah but I&#039;m not a big fan of having all that go through customs though. It is your show, I never understood why to save a little bit people were willing to ship something like that for possible inspection upon arrival at the border especially with all the new security precautions since 9/11. It makes much more sense to play it safe and stay domestic in my humble opinion. Have fun and be well!

				i&#039;ve never had a problem. if you can split up your order would be a good idea. find out beforehand how many pills powder your vendor can stuff in one delivery. might look suspicious if you get 50 e-bay envelopes in a day

				If it are orders sent in regular envelopes (like LSD) I don&#039;t see why not. When getting multiple BIG packages, from all over the world, it might raise some suspicion. Also remember that if one of the packages get nabbed by customs, chances are your other orders will also be intercepted.<br /><br />But most of the time you&#039;ll be fine I guess, just don&#039;t overdo it!
