				After picking up some blue heroin on Sunday...yes...blue. I decided enough of this shit. Monday after work I went <br />straight to library, as suggested from a member, set up a Mt. Gox account, put the amount I wanted to deposit, <br />printed the slip, went to a moneygram place deposited the money and 30 mins. later I had Bit Coins in my <br />Mt. Gox account. Came home and was ready to make my first purchase and i noticed the vendor i decided to go with on <br />Sunday had taken his ads down. I then started to look at a second vendor. I PM&#039;d this other vendor and he said since <br />I did not have 5 transactions I would have to FE early. I decided to wait until today and try again and see if my vendor <br />of choice was back up. Sure enough after work today i logged on with no problem and there was my vendor of choice. <br />I PM&#039;d him and then sat my computer down for about 20 minuets went to get back on SR and...<br /><br />Unable to connect<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firefox can&#039;t establish a connection to the server at silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.<br /><br />then tried new identity and nothing. Then I went to the forums and I am having no problems here...Looks like my transfer <br />of funds from Mt. Gox to SR will have to wait...bumming<br /><br />...and BTW it has taken over 10 times posting this topic. I keep getting that the letter&#039;s in the picture i have entered are<br />not correct when they are...what&#039;s up with this?<br />

				SR is down for everyone at the moment im pretty sure because it hasnt loaded for me all morning might be something to do with the bitcoin price surging to 61 dollars but that is just a guess its not based on any actual knowledge however i am certain it will be back shortly it goes down from time to time dont worry.
