				I&#039;ve noticed spendbitcoins.com has ended its Australian domestic conversion of BTC to bank accounts and prepaid visa along with Mtgox and ecardone being seized in the US, there was another outfit in Berlin offering a range of similar conversion services and on the spot real currency exchange that is also now gone.<br />No doubt this is a trend where only more operators will pressured into closing or have their business&#039;s fall into line with normal banking protocols.<br /><br />With the concept of any more growth in the slice of the black economy which is roughly 20% of global GDP and the whole crime and laundering thing that BTC attracts government agencies are obviously mobilizing.<br /><br />With such an assertive and unilateral involvement from close trading countries which would seem both timed and strategic, would it be fair to say that the potential of BTC remaining an autonomous currency system is becoming increasingly slim?<br /><br />I&#039;m keen to ask the SR community what they think and if they see any solutions, or know of any countries offering to work with BTC under what must be a shiteload of political pressure from the US and others....<br />Also what would happen if Spooks were to get there hands on the BTC creator? Could they not detain him and extract Algorithms etc?<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Moloko
