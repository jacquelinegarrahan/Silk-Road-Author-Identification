				Mine personally was a Yellow Sun years ago. it was one of the first pills i had, so that probably had something to do with it.&nbsp; Mitsubishi&#039;s in the early 2000&#039;s were always good.

				I feel like most of the pills I used to get back in the day had a lot of psychedelic-ness to them, almost like a small hit of acid. I wonder what that shit was. What ever it was it used to train wreck me the next day, so fuck those. Probably heroin is my guess. <br /><br />

				That&#039;s the problem with these fuckin&#039; pills, never know what you&#039;re getting. They have all kinds of random shit in them... baking powder, dog jizz, coke, heroin, frog piss, etc.

				Around 2001 there was a batch of Euro Dollars floating around my area (not for long) which were just incredible. I&#039;d say better than the Doves that were awesome I took in the mid 90s. I had a break from taking beans for about five years and have started dabbling again the past couple. Tried a few of the Dutch ones and wasn&#039;t that impressed. Then I tried one of those Lambo Shields a few weeks ago which are just wow, insanely good. Like real old school shit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				In 2002 or 2003, a Canadian vendor was selling horse pills that were grey, for the life of me I can&#039;t remember what sort of logo was pressed into them, but man they were otherworldly good. Back then the going rate for quality pills in my area was $20 a pop, these things you could sell for $30 easily while advising &quot;just wait til you try them, trust me&quot;, and there would never be any complaints after the fact.<br /><br />Their product range was unfuckingbelievable. Big-ass tubs of pharmaceutical coke, pure hydrocodone powder, powder GHB, you name it... I&#039;m getting a pants tent reminiscing. It was a crying shame when they got busted a year or so later and wound up on the Canadian news. They were apparently slingin&#039; high power firearms as well, and I always wondered if the guns were what really did them in.<br /><br />

				I had these Bentleys in Ibiza back in 2006 that were insane - made me vomit (you know, when you spew really quick and can&#039;t help it) in Pacha and then moved on to DC10 (that place was crazy).<br /><br />Back in Aus, the first pill I ever had was a Cali White in 1997 - chopped for hours and hours.&nbsp; After that it was a these round blue ones called snowballs from the UK.&nbsp; So intense I chipped my tooth.<br /><br />Had some white mitsubishis in 1999 on the eve of 2000 that were probably best ever.&nbsp; Chipped my tooth again and one pill had me on a good roll for about 4 hours plus.&nbsp; I was so chopped I couldn&#039;t move...<br /><br />We had these blue butterflies in 2001 that were quality also.

				In my experience Mortal Kombat&#039;s definitely, a better roll in some cases than bombing pure MDMA. A good 12 hour roll for festivals if you split it in half and re-dose, hardly any body load and from someone who can have pretty horrific comedowns I hardly experienced one with these.
