				Hello everyone,<br /><br />First things first, hope all is well with ya&#039;ll!&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly new to the community and wanted to receive some general feedback in regards to good cannabis vendors.&nbsp; Who are your favorite cannabis vendors and why?&nbsp; I know there are many to choose from out there, but I&#039;m curious as to who has had great success with vendors.&nbsp; Thus far I&#039;ve had some really great experiences on SR with the vendors I&#039;ve placed orders with, but maybe I&#039;ve been on a lucky streak.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read some horror stories on here, people getting scammed or losing lots of BTC.&nbsp; I wanted to share with you my most recent success story as well because the last vendor I ordered from was top notch and I feel other SR members would benefit from a great transaction such as the one I&#039;ll describe below.<br /><br />Currently my favorite vendor is Cannabis Crew.&nbsp; I was really skeptic at first because they were a new vendor, but from reading their posts and vendor description I had a feeling these guys were pretty professional.&nbsp; Well they far exceeded my expectations in the customer service department because I was full of questions and they were right there to answer all of them in a timely fashion and with a high level of professionalism.<br /><br />So I place my order and within a day it was already in transit.&nbsp; 2 days later I receive a package in the mail.&nbsp; The packaging was unbelievable!&nbsp; No trace of odor and it was sealed under several layers.&nbsp; Not just your typical food vac type of vacuum seal either because the buds were still fluffy and full once I got to it (it took 3 layers to get to my product).<br /><br />The actual bud was of the highest quality.&nbsp; I would consider myself a connoisseur when it comes to marijuana and have had many different strains in my day and this stuff was right up there with the best of them.&nbsp; I actually haven&#039;t had bud this good since I last visited Cali and a buddy of mine allowed me to try some of his medical grade.&nbsp; This is definitely of that caliber.&nbsp; All three strains had their own characteristics that made me like them, but let me tell you if you try a little mix of all three (I ordered their Sativa lovers pack) it will most certainly put you where you want to be.<br /><br />Either way just wanted to share out my experience, I hope to hear some great stories from you guys.&nbsp; Below is the link of what I purchased in case any of you are interested in shooting those guys (or gals) from Cannabis Crew a message.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c2f859f5dd

				It&#039;s always so interesting to me when I see people posting reviews of bud on SR. I find it silly because I live in an area where bud is extremely easy to find. (and we have, arguably, the best bud in the world) I can get the finest wax hash edibles greens, you name it, anywhere I walk. Everybody grows here and I can get top shelf medical grade for 50 an oz if I wanted to. In fact...maybe I should just become a vendor and just resell everything :O

				Hey streetelitist I have to admit I&#039;m a bit jealous.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have not been blessed with living in an area where cannabis is readily accessible, hence I must order from here.&nbsp; I can definitely see why it seems silly since you have it all around you, but not all of us are so fortunate.&nbsp; Now if you ever do become a vendor then let me know, maybe I&#039;ll sample some of your products!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				nuggz is a really, really awesome vendor and grows BADASS weed (ask anyone who tried the sour tsunami omfg) but probably won&#039;t have listings up for a while cuz they&#039;re focusing on growing right now.. i also got hooked up w. some good oil and they&#039;re probably one of the most generous and genuinely nice ppl i&#039;ve ever met<br /><br />farmer1 grows skush and if you like indica you really don&#039;t need to look further than that, got hash too and will eventually have other concentrates IIRC<br /><br />norcalconnection will hook you up with half a zone of pretty nice honeycomb for 3 hundo.. fuck yeaaa<br /><br />im waiting right now on a chunk of gaiagarden&#039;s bho..&nbsp; it looks amazing and here&#039;s some of the weed they have right now that they make it from: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/8cae1e30d8&nbsp; the prophet, one of my all-time fave strains, a real heavy hitter if you get the bubba phenotype and everyone has been giving this weed rave reviews.&nbsp; for 265 a zone, well, you do the math... this is headstash shit too like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UER0r-HCm5I
