				Hiya , I`ve recently stopped smoking weed and would like a benzo that does the same sort of job ( heavy body , mind blank , just chill on the couch and watch a movie without a care in the world lol) <br /><br />been taking valium but they don`t seem as strong as they used to be . I`ve tried all different kinds (10mg) and been taking 5+ at a time but not really had an effect on me and i don`t have a strong tollerance.<br /><br />does anybody have any recomendations on a benzo that would give me that effect ?<br /><br />Thanks

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi, know what you mean, love the heavy, relaxed feeling I used to get from weed. Don&#039;t smoke anymore, don&#039;t smoke anything now. First off, harm reduction, benzo&#039;s are crazy addictive, very easy to build tolerance (as you&#039;ve already found) and have prob the worst withdrawal effects I&#039;ve ever experienced. Long term users literally die convulsing from the withdrawals. So take it easy, is what I&#039;m saying :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To your question, I really enjoy Clonazepam. Alprazolam is good too, but the short term memory loss I get from that is pretty extreme. Best wishes, Hitch.

				I don&#039;t mean to contradict Hitch, but I&#039;ve used valium and temazepam a fair bit and haven&#039;t built up tolerance or addiction/withdrawl. They&#039;re good for anxiety and insomnia, respectively. Worst withdrawl I&#039;ve had was a restless night.<br /><br />Not saying they&#039;re risk free, but IMO they are lower risk than a lot of other stuff you can get on SR.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;:) Contradict away my friend. I may very well have an unusually nasty reaction to benzos. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure, I haven&#039;t tried them sorry. Only ever get roche vals. Temazepam hits me pretty hard, I usually just go to sleep soon after taking them :) Really only use them to come down off meth.

				If i were you i would buy Alprazolam powder and dissolve it in propylene glycol 1mg/ml, then use a dropper to dose.<br /><br />2mg i would say would be a recommended maximum

				I agree with 2mg of zans being the max in 24 hours and only with a short period of time, never over 3 weeks.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2mg of Alprazolam is barely a therapeutic dose. I&#039;d take 1-2mg as an initial control dose to see how you react with the drug. Recreational dose for me at the moment is between 5-10mg, but I don&#039;t have as high a tolerance as I used too.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;With Temazepam I usually take 3-4 X 10mg&#039;s, which is about the same as you&#039;d get prescribed for treatment of insomnia. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Agree strongly with xxsquidxx on avoiding sustained use. IMO if you use any benzos for a day or two, don&#039;t take any again for a week. This is especially relevant for you Mutts because your particularly after the sedative-hypnotic effects to which tolerance develops quite quickly, usually after only a couple of days.<br />

				You start to develop a tolerance for benzos so it is important to not take them for long stretches. The withdrawal is horrible as well. I would recommend doing weed for a few months and then benzos for 1 month this will allow to enjoy the full benefits of both.
