				OK so I&#039;ve been browsing here for a couple years.&nbsp; I actually found SR when Bitcoins were $7.&nbsp; My buddy said we should buy a bunch way back then.&nbsp; LOL..&nbsp; We didn&#039;t though.&nbsp; Kickin ourselves in the ass over that one.&nbsp; Not my question though.&nbsp; I decided to start ordering and deposited some Bitcoins via Vanilla Reload Thursday evening( about 48 hours ago).&nbsp; I made 3 separate orders (2 for drugs, 1 for a precursor)3 separate vendor, all with good reviews - and especially in speed of shipping..&nbsp; The precursor was in transit by friday morning.&nbsp; The other 2 vendors are still processing, haven&#039;t messaged me, and both claim to process orders within 48 hours.&nbsp; So basically I ordered these thursday evening and as of now the best I can hope for is shipped out on monday.&nbsp; Thats 4 days to get shipped out!!&nbsp; Is this kinda normal?&nbsp; I can totally see how some of these guys may be overwhelmed with orders, but that was kind of why I ordered on Thursday instead of Friday.&nbsp; And on top of that I decided to get some more coin, and gave my code to a diff vendor than the first time to get Coin from.&nbsp; And it&#039;s been 24 hours on that and I haven&#039;t got my coin yet.&nbsp; The first time it took the better part of a day, but I figured that was due to it being my first time.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s an absolutely awesome thing and we are quite honored to even have this place, so I&#039;m not trying to be bitchy, just wondering if these times are normal?&nbsp; Thanks for your replies.

You said the 2 that are still processing claim up to 48 hrs and it sounds like your right around the 48 hr mark. So, it being a weekend, your looking at Monday anyway if all goes right. You should communicate with them and find out whats up, be polite, don&#039;t just jump into what the fuck mode. As far as funding your account, it sounds like you used one of those coin vendors that work outside the escrow system and it&#039;s straight up honor system. Plenty of people get burned like that. You should check out localbitcoins.com, that site has it&#039;s own escrow system so your protected from being scammed.&nbsp; There&#039;s multiple methods of obtaining coins on there too, you don&#039;t necessarily have to meet someone, some of them you can just deposit your money into their bank account and they send your coins to the wallet you have on that site, localbitcoins. There&#039;s other ways too, all with escrow protection.

				The in transit time thing is kind of funny because it&#039;s somewhat of a guessing game.&nbsp; There are vendors who will mark in transit early yet put the package in the mail later.&nbsp; Then it can be the other way around where package is in the mail but vendor didn&#039;t mark in transit (less likely than the previous IMO).&nbsp; Every vendor is different and since some of the vendors you ordered off of have that policy stating they&#039;ll have it out in 48 hours, it probably wouldn&#039;t hurt to just shoot those particular vendors a quick message and ask for a status update on your order.&nbsp; Tell &#039;em why you need it soon and see what they say.&nbsp; If a vendor doesn&#039;t have it written up though regarding how long it&#039;ll take to ship or mark in transit, I wouldn&#039;t message them.&nbsp; They do have I believe 4 days (or maybe 5 can&#039;t remember) to mark it in transit before you have the option of hitting cancel.&nbsp; If cancel becomes available, I&#039;d send a message at that point saying you&#039;d like to know where the order stands otherwise you&#039;ll cancel.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be threatening but that&#039;s what I&#039;d do.&nbsp; And then finally I&#039;d tread real lightly with the reload in the future.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve sent the code to more than one vendor this is how people get scammed.&nbsp; I hope you did your homework as to which vendor is reliable and truth worthy because the first vendor you sent the number to might take the money and then the new vendor you&#039;re waiting on might check the number and find there is zero dollars on the card.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying that to scare you but it&#039;s a risk.&nbsp; I have had a bitcoin vendor take 24 hours but usually they def. say aprox. how long it&#039;ll take for them to get you your coin.&nbsp; Also if the other feedback says people are getting there coins super fast and it&#039;s say 48 hours and you haven&#039;t gotten them I&#039;d be messaging the vendor.&nbsp;

				I appreciate the replies.&nbsp; I acttually did shoot the 2 vendors a nice message just expressing my interest in the status.&nbsp; I also had thought about the whole &quot;when did the package actually ship, in regards to when they mark it in transit.&nbsp; 1 of the 2 vendors hasn&#039;t even been online since my orders, so that explains that.&nbsp; And I did get communication from the guy with my reloadit info thankfully.&nbsp; I really wasn&#039;t worried about it until I read one of your replies.&nbsp; I&nbsp; ended up cancelling, and have decided to just go back to the vendor that handled my first transaction, but I think I&#039;ll look into the local bitcoin thing.&nbsp; Sounds promosing.&nbsp; Thanks again for the info.
