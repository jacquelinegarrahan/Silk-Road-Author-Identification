				Placed 5 orders the other day with a few different vendors.&nbsp; 2 of the orders were for digital downloads.&nbsp; I followed the instructions on the vendor&#039;s pages, but for some reason 4 of the 5 orders are still &#039;processing&#039;.&nbsp; The feedback for each of the vendor&#039;s was great and included comments like &quot;ultra fast shipping A++&quot;.<br /><br />Any ideas why my orders haven&#039;t been handled?&nbsp; I&#039;m especially curious about the digital downloads, as I expected those to be dealt with almost immediately.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your feedback on this matter.

				Check and see when the vendor was last logged in. If you only placed the order the other day,<br />it may be they haven&#039;t been on to process yet. You could always PM the vendor with a nice message<br />to check the status.

				If you are concerned about your order, especially if you are trying a new vendor, don&#039;t be afraid to send them a FRIENDLY message asking what&#039;s going on. Some vendors really get swamped with ordered and messages so it can take quite some time for them to get the orders packaged and out. You should never feel like you can&#039;t message a vendor and you don&#039;t need to wait 3 days. You&#039;re giving them YOUR money, you&#039;re allowed to know what&#039;s going on with it. It&#039;s often pretty difficult to be patient when you know what will be in the package you&#039;re waiting on ;)

				I agree. If the vendor&#039;s page doesn&#039;t give a time frame (like saying it will be 2-4 days) after a day or 2 I would politely ask them for an update if available.

				Thanks for your advice folks.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had thought about the fact that maybe they hadn&#039;t been on the Road in a few days.&nbsp; But in all the cases, the vendors have been logging in each day since I placed the order.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve had some orders from certain vendors stay in processing up until I could cancel. Other vendors ship the same day or within 24hrs. Guess it depends on how dedicated the vendor is

				how about the vendor page. Does it mention anything about FE? I&#039;ve run across 1 or 2 vendors that I ordered and didn&#039;t think twice about it. Then after a day or 2 I see there was no updates and it was bc the vendor said they don&#039;t ship till FE.<br /><br />With that said though I would not advice to FE unless you&#039;ve used the vendor before.

				It really shouldn&#039;t take long but some vendors only login once a day. SR or TOR may be having issues. I&#039;m not trying to make excuses but sometimes SR does act weird. Good Luck

				Vendors have a max 4 days, but most of us knock it out in 1 to 2 days.&nbsp; <br />One thing to remember, if you are in the US and your ordered on Saturday (day 1), the PO was &quot;closed&quot; Sunday and Monday (holiday).&nbsp; You will probably see it updated tonight.

				With most vendors it seems to be about a day. Sometimes 2. However, I&#039;ve had one that took a week. After 4 days you receive the option to cancel without penalty. If the vendor hasn&#039;t gotten back to you by that time, you are probably best off cancelling it and going with another vendor.
