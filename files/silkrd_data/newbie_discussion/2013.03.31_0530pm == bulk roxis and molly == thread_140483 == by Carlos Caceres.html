				If you keep getting busted perhaps you should pick another vocation. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see how selling Oxy (as posed to weed) will prevent you from getting busted. If caught you will face far more time in prison. <br /><br />Prices on the road are quite a bit higher than street prices even in bulk. Might be better to try it the other way around.just a thought.&nbsp;

				From what I hear people just buy coke and cook it. That&#039;s why no crack on the road. <br /><br />So I hear anyway. <br /><br />What kind of problem are you having with your wallet?

				LMFAO NO WAY DUDE!<br /><br />Its funny cause in your pic, you dont look like a total idiot..<br /><br /><br />Thinking about it now, it would seem more plausible to me, that the OP is infact an enemy of the real Carlos Caceres, and is trying to some how get this kid busted again. <br /><br />Either way, tiisk tiiisk.
