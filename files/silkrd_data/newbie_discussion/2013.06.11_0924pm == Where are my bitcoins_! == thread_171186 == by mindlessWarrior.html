				Your lucky dude, I can&#039;t get blockchain to work fror me today, and thats what I&#039;m used to using and the fastest abd easiest way for me. I even tried going right to bitinstant and had no luck.,<br />Anyway, send an email to blockchain customer support, I&#039;ve had the same issue a couple o times and they always have been able to work it out.

				Well im not sure &#039;lucky&#039; is the word id use to describe my situation right now, as I have a missing 200 dollars. So I just want to make sure I did this right. I sent the funds through bitinstant to a wallet address. Then listed my wallet address from blockchain. Succesfully paid the funds. Now I should have bitcoins in my blockchain wallet, correct?

				LOL<br /><br />No its not a big deal for starters. I mean $200&nbsp; is $200, but many people that have experienced the same delay as you for thousands of dollars. Notice I say delay, because thats all it is your experiencing. <br /><br />Secondly 3 hours is hardly a delay at all. It can take as little as 1hr and as long as a few days in extreme (rare) cases.&nbsp;
