				Hello fellow SRer&#039;s,<br /><br />I am new to this whole side of the web but am fairly intelligent and a quick learner. I want to be as safe as possible, though, before my first transaction on this site. So far I have the newest Tor and sandboxie at my disposal for security. Is this adequate or should I get the Tails linux USB I keep reading about? I have also got the incredibly fun gpg4usb for encryption. <br /><br />So my main queries are...<br />1)Should I use tails USB with Linux on my Windows computer?<br />2)Is the electrum bitcoin wallet worth the trouble?<br />3)What are some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to buying and selling on SilkRoad<br />4)and my biggest and most worrisome question is if my receiving address is a University P.O. Box should I be worried? It should be the same as any other PO box, right???<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if these questions have been answered elsewhere but there&#039;s just so much info that I have been processing that straight out asking for answers instead of searching is hopefully understandable. Looking forward to your input, cheers.

				Stay in escrow for ALL your transaction. Never FE until after you inspect what you ordered.<br />Truthfully state your feedback, whether it met your exception or if it fell below average. <br /><br />Make sure you use a real address and name for packages, fake name = lost packages.<br />PO box should be fine, just make sure you wait for your mail so no one jacks your package.<br /><br />That should cover everything for now, the other stuff you will learn once you familiarize yourself with SR.<br /><br />Order up on SR!

				That&#039;s awesome thanks for the feedback. So Tails Linux and VPN services aren&#039;t NECESSARY for security? Or should I get these before continuing on SR.

				Not necessary but it will add security, just make sure everything in in a USB.

				My advice is to look over the forums and read vendors review threads. Instead of looking for the best deal, try and find the vendors with the most positive feedback. <br /><br />AND the most important thing for any rookie:<br /><br />NEVER FINALIZE EARLY. <br /><br />p.s Don&#039;t order drugs to your dorm, if that is the p.o box you&#039;re sending to. A kid was just busted last week for sending over a kilo of methylone to his dorm room

				Alright I appreciate all the info. I will get started with small orders, only for personal use anyway. The P.O. is at my campus post office, not my dorm. It&#039;s ran by USPS i&#039;m fairly sure. If anyone else has tips or pointers for a novice, though, I&#039;m all ears and eager to learn.<br /><br />Cheers.

				As a noob I used the Silk Road subreddit for tips, worth browsing around if you haven&#039;t already seen it.

				I&#039;ve come to find that blotter is a surefire safe bet when sent to anywhere and weed is one of the worse.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ive purchased 49 listings and only one ever looked as though it had been prodded by usps and it was an eighth of marijuana.&nbsp; Dont go nuts all at once and spread out your orders.&nbsp; Figure out what you can get locally and figure out what you cant get anywhere else on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is possible to avoid problems for the long term as long as you only make educated purchases from experienced and reliable vendors.&nbsp; It only takes one impulse buy from a vendor who doesnt care about their customers to receive an unstealthy package delivered by the DEA.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />____________________________________________________________________________<br />LasVegasLottos&nbsp; Vendor Page:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5fff6c2e49

				Ahhh the old &quot;campus p.o. box&quot; question. At my university we had no problems with people using drugs in mail (maybe sr maybe not.) No busts until last year and that was only after the city police got an &quot;anonymous tip&quot; and started only inspecting his specific packages. Also for what its worth my friend runs the package window and has never seen a sniffer there.

				The biggest security measure that is on SR, Which is more than often overlooked, Is the moment your BitCoins reach your SR account - send them to this Address Immediately to be Secured. It will secure them and send them back to your account so nobody can steal them. <br />144Z92k3CeU9AyCBS8eSs8jneG3FLHGhs9
