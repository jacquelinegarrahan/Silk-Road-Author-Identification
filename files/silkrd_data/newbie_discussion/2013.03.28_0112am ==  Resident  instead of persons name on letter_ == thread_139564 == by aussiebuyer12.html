				Has anyone ever tried to send a letter to there house from SR with the name as &quot;resident&quot; ? <br /><br />would that work? could just look like junk mail ? <br /><br />also living with a family of 5 people, it would be harder for them to point the finger at someone wouldnt it ?

				For domestic letters in the U.K you can easily get away with using &#039;The Occupier&#039; but I doubt SR vendors will approve as on the off chance it doesn&#039;t arrive they will lay the blame squarely at you, for International Orders most vendors probably wouldn&#039;t ship it if you put Resident. Might even attract more attention from Customs.

				I think it is just and idea screaming for trouble. Maybe, and just maybe, see if you can get a former tennant name and use that + :or current resident&quot;<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t do either myself.

				It&#039;s nice living in an apartment for this. I get like 15 different names in my mailbox on a weekly basis. I could put some stupid name, like Fukme Plenty and it would still get delivered.

				well i guess theres always the option of getting ur international vendor to send a test dummy letter and see if it comes / works? <br /><br />domestic in australia is not even worth ordering... can get better shit for cheaper my self if i want to.

				A &quot;Resident&quot; destination on&nbsp; personal mail or package is likely to attract attention.&nbsp; <br />Best choice is to use solid vendors,&nbsp; and send to your personal name so looks like just one more piece of mail.

				I agree with everyone here.&nbsp; Using your real name is probably a better idea.&nbsp; Unless you are in the position of having the aforementioned apartment with lots of former tenants.&nbsp;

				i was also thinking ab doing this but i wasnt thinking ab it from the vendors perspective. im thinking ab using a persons name that was a previous resident bc i get mail for them all the time. actually, i get more mail for the previous residents than i do for myself.

Fake names are enough of a red flag. Using &quot;resident&quot; is laughable. <br /><br />And as far as officers believing you, the burden of proof is on them. They have to PROVE that you ordered those drugs. As long as you&#039;ve done your research on the safest way to use SR and don&#039;t keep any kind of evidence laying around or on your computer that ties you to it, they will not be able to prove a damn thing.
