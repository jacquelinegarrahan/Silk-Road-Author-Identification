				If I order say a magazine subscription or any sort of mail delivery that I&#039;d get regularly in a fake name so that my mailman starts seeing this name regularly, would it be a good idea to use this fake name on SR orders so I can just say well I didn&#039;t order that that&#039;s not even my name on the package. Or would it just seem more fishy than me just using my real name?

				There seems to be quite a lot of conflicting suggestions about which names to use on your packages. I&#039;m sure that, if you were going to use a fake name, a fake magazine subscription wouldn&#039;t hurt. However, I&#039;ve started using my real name on all my orders- I doubt it increases the likelihood of your getting arrested given that anyone could have used that name, and I think it certainly does increase your odds of actually getting your drugs if they end up at the post office.<br /><br />What does seem like good advice is to wait before opening your package. I know it&#039;s exciting but just set it aside until the evening or the next morning. In this way it&#039;ll be much harder to get caught &quot;with&quot; drugs if the police have had their suspicion aroused.<br /><br />(3/50)

				Yes get a magazine supscription with the fake name....<br /><br />Your mailman will come to notice that name and not give a second glance to a package or letter....<br /><br />Ordering with a fake name just raises a RED flag with the mailman....

				There is a lot of conflicting ideas and suggestions on this. I think the best thing you could do would be to do a search across silk road, as you&#039;ll be able to see peoples comments for and against it. Not that many full members look at the newbie section so you&#039;ll probably get a better info that way. <br /><br />Just search for things like &#039;fake name&#039;, &#039;name&#039;, &#039;real name&#039; etc.
