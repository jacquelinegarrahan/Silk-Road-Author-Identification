				You can buy bitcoin from vendors on the market, simple.<br />Buy MP or GD loading card and exchange it from them.<br /><br />Thank you<br />YCTT

Have them sent to a tumbler, and then have the tumbler send them to your SR wallet (you&#039;ll lose a little in fees but it&#039;s worth it). <br /><br />Or like YCTT said you can buy from vendors on SR. It&#039;s risky for new buyers tho, as there&#039;s no escrow &amp; it&#039;s easy to get scammed. <br />

				I&#039;ve mentioned this numerous times on other threads, but give VirWox a shot. I use them once every 2 weeks.<br />If you have a tight budget like myself, this is a great way to go.<br /><br />For larger bitcoin purchases, I would suggest what the others have, get a moneypak and trade for bitcoin.<br />This is a great option since it&#039;s recycling the coins that have already been used on the road, so they have already been mixed.<br /><br />Good Luck

You can buy online from people on localbitoins.com. There&#039;s a whole section for it. You can also find people on #bitcoin-otc channel on Freenode.<br />
