				Alright, I need to accomplish 2 things here, so I&#039;m going to get to 50 (deleting my longtime account was a stupid fucking idea), and also ask/discuss something I&#039;ve noticed. <br /><br />In a nutshell, USPS has been a joke lately, and not even with packages relating to SR. In the last 45 days, I&#039;ve had something like 8-10 packages (USPS orders from a major online retailer), regular mail, and 1 order from a non-SR but SR like place go missing. <br /><br />After reluctantly checking the tracking, there was a 5 day window where all mail to my address was just marked &quot;undeliverable&quot; and sent to nowhere. Valid vendors of legit goods didn&#039;t get it returned. The other order is apparently sitting in the PO in NorCal. <br /><br />What the fuck is the deal?

				Quick background - I&#039;m as addicted to shopping as I am anything else, so it&#039;s not uncommon for weeks to go buy with 1-2 packages a day coming from online retailers, eBay, music stores, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;ve collectively had probably 300 boxes come in the last year, and none have ever had any issues (sans 1 which was held at USPS for hilarious reasons). <br /><br />

				Call your post office and complain, like any civilian who isn&#039;t receiving their mail would. I did this a few months ago and my service noticeably improved. If this does not help, you might consider a PO box, although there are those who would warn against that.

				I did this...I complained and also had an online retailer complain (as they had 4 official resellers lose their shipments in whatever fuck up took place, and by policy had to have them re-send them to me at their expense). <br /><br />I offered to pay for the reships of doodads to each, but only one asked me to actually go through with it. <br /><br />The thing that does weird me out is that the one package that have been trouble was marked &quot;undeliverable&quot; but had valid addresses on both fronts. It came, wasn&#039;t delivered, sat in my PO a few states away, and now is just sitting in the PO near SanFran. <br /><br />It&#039;s had no traction in months, and I even requested a delivery. If it had been the first, I&#039;d be sketched out. But it wasn&#039;t.
