				I&#039;ve had it take as long as 6 hours, I believe. The Silk Road is basically laundering the money for you so no one will ever find out what you spent it on. So it&#039;s a really nifty service, but it&#039;s not instant.

				mine once took about 12 hours, i think it depends on how silk road is doing, if they are doing maintenance it might be a bit slower. normally its about 6 for me though.

				read that thread the mod posted...wow<br /><br />Been a member here since the ole days...(which really sucks that I can&#039;t post anymore in the other forums btw!) and delays do happen. But man...Right when I think the site is back, and dump some coins on the road to go on a spree...this happens. But hey, the point is....it happens. I have so much faith in DPR! That guy or gal has been our best interests at heart...What I don&#039;t have faith in though is the value on my coins unfortunately :&#039;(

				I,ve been waiting 19 hours for my coin to go into wallet i,m not panicking after reading whats in the forum i,m sure it will be fixed but i agree with other people that a warning could have been put on when it was realised there was a problem at least people would have been aware they were going to have a wait and would have expected a wee msg on a forum from DPR i think it would have helped settle people but maybe too busy trying to fix the problem for us, its not like it hasn,t happened before as other members are stating and it was always sorted so confident all will be ok&nbsp; :)

				Like Libertas and Scout said, here and in countless other threads about the same issue.<br /><br />I had multiple transactions yesterday go through in minutes, which is not common for me. Now i have 34+ confirmations on a small transfer and SR is still empty. <br /><br />Shit happens, price we pay for such a utopia, wouldnt ya say?<br /><br />Ive actually on two occasions waited over 36 hours for my coin, whilst blockchain showed it was all good.
