				That wont hurt anything.<br />It&#039;s still from your account.<br />It&#039;s just gonna take anywhere from 30minutes to 4 hours depending on the btc network speed today...it&#039;s different timing every minute every day...just depends if it&#039;s a slow or fast day how long it takes to get there.
