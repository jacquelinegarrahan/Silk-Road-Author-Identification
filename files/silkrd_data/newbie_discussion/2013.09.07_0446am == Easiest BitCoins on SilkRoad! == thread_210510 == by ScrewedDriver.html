				After browsing here on Tor for more than a month, I was a tad unsure that I wanted to entrust some BC dealer I&#039;d never meet with my cold hard cash. After considering all of my options on how to get started here on the Road, one vendor suggested I check out the Money section and find a reputable dealer in coinage. Imagine my surprise when I found that theabsolutefinest not only dealt in premium medical grade cannabis products but also sold BitCoins through my own bank! <br /><br />Long story short, I made a quick trip down to Bank of America, pulled money out of the ATM, gave the teller inside the provided deposit information and before I could get back home and finish eating my supper I had BCs faster than ANY site on the Internet could possibly offer! Being a newbie, I was even more surprised that theabsolutefinest walked me through the whole process, maintained EXCELLENT communications throughout and even gave me not only a more than fair exchange rate but several incentives to order cannabis products through them, as well!<br /><br />So, not only did they make a tidy little commission on my first BitCoin purchase, they are also about to receive my first order here on the SR.<br /><br />The rating system needs to be adjusted so that customers can give more than 5 out of 5 stars, because theabsolutefinest has already gone above and beyond in taking care of this customer. I cannot wait to try out their wares! <br /><br />Cut and paste to your browser&#039;s address bar to get BitCoins the EASY way at your nearest Bank of America: <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/131fa3cd48<br /><br />Once again, THANK YOU, theabsolutefinest!!!
