				Sent him 650.00 today via cash deposit at BOA. Well apparently SR has demoted him already and Im shit out of luck..Ive read the Rumor Mill discussion on him and seems that others have been screwed out of $$ recently as well...Some easy google search brought me to His info and by that I mean his address and telephone number...skip ahead a while and now we are at this point. I called the number listed and without too much effort got info that he did infact deposit &quot;about 1900.00 in money orders today&quot; ...seems fishy right? could this be the guy? I have ALL his info bank acct, telephone, address. Im going to go to bank of america tomorrow and see if I can get some money back. If anyone else has lost money from him CONTACT BANK OF AMERICA AND LET THEM KNOW HE SCAMMED YOU , BUYING BITCOINS ISNT ILLEGAL! I am going to say I was promised bitcoins and he never delivered and that I know he scammed other and he received (his words) about &quot;1900.00&quot; and try to recoup some of my money. IF ANYONE WANTS HIS INFO LET ME KNOW AND I WILL POST IT FOR THOSE WHO WERE SCAMMED..hopefully the vets will read this in the rumor mill post, I unfortuantely dont have enough post to post in that area so if anyone wants they can copy and paste this in that section...Any advice would be helpful as well... THE MORE PEOPLE THAT COME FORWARD THE GREATER CHANCE WE HAVE TO GET OUR MONEY BACK!! <br /><br />sorry for the excessive caps..Im just so furious!

				Yea..true but like I said..buying bitcoins isnt illegal. I would be going into bank of america and telling them he offered me bitcoins in exchange for 650.00 worth, I still have my depoist reciept and I will let them know I know he deposited a bunch of money because on a forum for bitcoins others said he scammed them..I just cant sit back and let this POS get away with this...I believe I have his info if anyone wants it...Im just super furious and he had good stats so Its completely unfair...Its making SR not worth it anymore..Anyone with suggestions on legit bitcoin suppliers? Sorry to vent, but I hate the feeling of being taking advantage of...

				Yup, out a quarter of a paycheck, cant do shit.&nbsp; I also looked up his info(dont really know what I planned on doing. just heat of the moment i gues) its likely that all the info is bullshit(identity theft and what not).&nbsp; Account was either sold or hacked and then ramp up by fake reviews. plus a little clever advertising &quot;5% for the next two days!&quot; and &quot;I have over 70 bitcoins and will be the only vender well stocked for the next couple days&quot; or something to that effect and some dick head gets away with thousands in a weekend.&nbsp; Any who the number I found linked to the name of the account info that was given is (352) ***-0817, I doubt there is a scammer at the end of that line so do with it what u will (was thinking of letting them know a account was opened in their name, but its a little shady).&nbsp; Actually edited out some numbers, just posting it to see if others got the same number in their own investigation.

				BoA isn&#039;t going to do anything for you. They have no dog in this fight. They aren&#039;t responsible for him, you or me. They just passed the money along, they have no liability in something like this. I can tell you right now they are going to say there is nothing they can do, it&#039;s not their problem, they are just the middleman. <br /><br />We got taken and we just have to suck it up.

And Static, I would love to give you everything I could find on this guy, I have his or should i say who I think he is BoA account number, his name and the zip, a simple google search showed only one guy with his name in that part of the state he lives in. Im now utterly confused. I called and he admitted to depositing over &quot;1900.00&quot; in moneyorders today..so it could be him, but now this news about his account being sold..Im confused entierly..please PM me and I will give you the info I have for him and the google info I pulled on him and how I got him to admit to depositing the money... I would greatly appreciate your help. If anything I would like to get myself and others money back...This should NOT be allowed on SR..guess these are pirate rules..sink or swim..

I mean could i have gone through a different site and got them yes, but Understand this, Benzoking had good feedback and had been around for awhile, I dont think that makes me stupid, maybe too trustworthy but not stupid. And Had I have known that YOU CAN SELL YOUR EFFING ACCOUNT like apparently this cocksucker did, I would have gone through someone else, specifically localbitcoins or Blue sky traders who had limited quanity available but were holding onto coins for me becaue they went fast today and I emailed them.

				Hey guys, sorry to hear you&#039;ve been rorted by some shit heel, that sucks :(<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me just say, because I don&#039;t want things to get any worse for you, SR admin take doxing very seriously. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a respected vendor or a scammy asshole, you&#039;ll get banned if you publish any private info, even private messaging it to another scam victim! They don&#039;t have many rules here, but that&#039;s one of the few and it&#039;s enforced vigorously.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;That said, I don&#039;t particularly agree with the people saying just let it go. You&#039;re right, buying bitcoins isn&#039;t illegal, neither&#039;s buying legal items from Silk Road. Scammers like this can be forced to pay for their misdeeds, but it usually takes pressure from a few people complaining and not letting it slide. Make those thieving rapist banks and that vicious American police force work for wronged Roadsters, it&#039;d be brilliant!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck, Hitch.

				Thank you Hitch, I appreciate you not being a jerk because a few dozen people thought they were buying from a reputable dealer in bitcoins..I for one, am going to be calling not only BoA and letting them know about the account and the person that this transpired with and the scam he ran, but will be calling the number I have for him based on a Google search and having already called him confirming its him and he deposited alot of $$ today... I honestly hope others do the same and do some due diligence to make him repay his wrong doing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Im not 100% on the rules on the forums but Im not just going to give the info out in a reply.. I cant say that If someone who was scammed asked me for his info that I wouldn&#039;t give it out, because If it is indeed him at the number I have, than he needs to make it right for everyone he scammed.. I can only imagine how much he actually got away with before SR/customer support was alerted and removed him. But I also blame SR/DPR for allowing accounts to be sold if that is what has transpired... It is unfair and costs SR users money...Seems that SR is going downhill quickly...<br /><br />Thanks for the positivity in this negative world Hitch !

				I do not think sr is to blame, it is not as if the sale was done above the table - the person only found out by the accounts behaviour and did not say anything immediately to sr - maybe if he had then you could blame dpr/sr.<br />good luck getting your cash anyway.

				I was one of the few that were scammed. I&#039;m now broke to the end of the month. <br /><br />Also, don&#039;t put us on the spot about not using an escrow system. Most of us merely go off of reviews and ratings and trust vendors merely by that alone. I had seen this guy in the past months ago so I said &quot;why not give this guy a try?&quot; Especially because his ratings were still high.<br /><br />Why are these sales even ALLOWED on SR if they aren&#039;t safe? It&#039;s almost like SR is promoting scams for profit by letting this sections run.<br /><br />Thanks BenzoKing. If my cancer kills me in 8 1/2 months or less from now.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as the rest of you. I placed an order 8/7/13, for 350.09, and I never received the bitcoin. He does answer the PM&#039;s that I send, but always a different excuse. If someone can PM me his personal information, I will reply with the BOA account number and the name. If enough of us have proof that we deposited money into his account, we could contact his local police, because this is fraud, and the money amount should be higher than a misdemeanor.

He advises not to buy your BTC from SR but doesn&#039;t say it&#039;s not allowed but basically if you do and lose your money it&#039;s out of the hands of SR.<br /><br />Now in regards to going to the cops I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to help your guys case. Think about it for a second and I know you guys are pissed and you have a right to be but do you really want an investigation into this? Why were you sending him money and what was it for? Bitcoins? Trust me you don&#039;t want authorities looking into this. The best thing if you have your info and you actually were able to talk to him on the phone which totally astounds me that you were able to do that which means he pretty much sucks at covering his tracks is set him up somehow to get your money back or get him tipped off. If you plan on doing that do it while the trail is still fresh. <br /><br />Sorry this happened to everyone. It&#039;s funny cause last Friday I wanted to buy Bitcoins and was going to use but something about him was off especially his review thread with people saying &#039;Excellent service&#039; and all of them had like 1 or 2 posts and all were canned responses. Remember never trust anyone on here until they prove it to you and take it a step further and don&#039;t bother buying bitcoins from here. If you do and you&#039;re using a new vendor place a small order for $100 if they allow a few times before making a big one but still I would just use localbitcoins. You can use coinbase too just make you tumble the coins.<br /><br />The other thing so we&#039;re not allowed to share a Vendors private info? A vendor that scammed idk how many fucking customer, why does SR give a shit about his info. IMO he lost the right when he scammed his customers. Please show me documentation that stats that if I&#039;m wrong.

				I feel like im beating a dead horse by keeping this topic alive, even though I started it..I have calmed down and accepted bad shit happens..In reguards to how i found his number, If it is truly him..I have his name and state and zip, only one guy with that name in that zip code..lucky huh! So i called up and without divulging anything further sounded professional and got him to say he deposited over $1900.00 in money orders..now that to me is alot for one day espically in money orders for an ordinary person...It makes me think this guy is retarded and Its him baised on that alone..Im not for giving out personal info but If I had to put a number on it im 75% sure this guy has something to do with it...If enough people want I will give out the same info that he gave me to do the cash deposit..really whats wrong with that?

Basically, all I can say is that again I know it freaking hurts being burned like that, but It could be worse and it could be better.Its life, sometimes your the one shitting and other times your the toilet..the ebb and flow of life I suppose..FYI I just used localbitcoin today, was able to buy coins under MTGOX and used paypal, so no fees and I didnt have to even take off my lady sweat pants and messy hair LOL, and my transaction went so well Im actually happy :) Try it out, I will never, REPEAT never use SR for buying coins unless they implement an escrow service..If it takes me 650.00 to figure that out then I guess that&#039;s what it takes.<br /><br />&nbsp;Im genuinely sorry for EVERYONE that lost money to him, If your like myself, and your not a trust fund baby or born into wealth and actually have to WORK for a living and its a huge disappointment to my outlook on humanity that people do this but some think money is worth it to ruin peoples lives...Im not trying to sound all Buddhist or whatever but try localbitcoins they have escrow.. And try to move on from this..staying angry isnt going to change anything...really, karma is a bitch :) It will come back full circle...<br /><br />If you want to donate to the BenzoKing survivor foundation ( hahaha) I will include my SR wallet address: <br /><br />1AM9nBoH8NCdrjVZ2rGvkFKkti5yassr6Q<br /><br />This is a joke ^^^ btw, unless of course you want to help a gal out :) <br /><br />Thanks everyone for the kind support and thanks to those also who where not so nice..your replies were ever so helpful -.-<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m glad to hear that your taking it this way. It really isn&#039;t worth it the end. You&#039;re right about people putting money before everything else. Whoever this vendor is in R/L this will come back to him one day whether or not it&#039;s by you or from this incident. Life has a weird sense of irony. It does sucking losing over $300. Happened to me when I was new here as well and it was very discouraging. I was fuming for about a good week but in the end I took it as a $300 lesson and it actually helped me to be more wary and learn everything I can to make myself secure. Not all Bitcoin vendors are scammer but the thing is even if your dealing with one that has a A++ rep and been doing for over 3 years what if one day after taking a shitload of transactions he ups and retires and takes all the money with him? Always a chance of that. I&#039;d donate to your fund but I only have $4, lol... don&#039;t know how much that would help :(

Obviously I am attempting to start a business here. I am not the last guy, so I can&#039;t speak for him, but what he did was terrible. I hope OP gets her money back by some means. Perhaps if someone decides to take the chance to work with me they could send some of the free money I am offering her way?

The account was sold a few months ago so it&#039;s not the real BenzoKing and I don&#039;t think many people knew this unless you were one of his regular customers. The orginal BenzoKing sold percs and you guessed it..benzos. <br /><br />Sorry you lost your money, it really sucks. It looks like quite a few people were affected by this. If you want help trying to track him down with the info and account numbers you have I wouldn&#039;t mind helping. I have a knack for putting puzzles together if you know what I mean. Don&#039;t bother going to the bank and complaining all that&#039;s likely to happen is either they won&#039;t give a shit or become suspicious of you. <br /><br />Local bitcoins is a safe and easy option.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good question!! How is it that an unknown can cash in on a previous vendor&#039;s reputation by buying the account and keeping the same name????? There should be a way for buyers to know the account is not with the original vendor and all previous feedback is null and void. This is a process that is ripe for abuse. How about it SR? Can you do something about this? Some kind of note that says the vendor bought the account, or delete all the old vendors feedback? We, the buyers, are responsible for making good buying decisions but SR should have some accountability too in helping to protect buyers who are trying to make good buying decisions.<br /><br />WOW! This is news to me and im sure mostly everyone that got spammed. WHY IS THIS ALLOWED?! I appreicate all that SR and DPR has and are still doing but this ^^^^ that you just reveiled would have made me NEVER buy from this d-bag. Im not trying to place blame but goddamnit if DPR/SR isnt somewhat to blame for letting this happen to unsuspecting customers who see good reviews next to a vendors name...Anyways whatever with all this BS.. And Static, I would love to give you everything I could find on this guy, I have his or should i say who I think he is BoA account number, his name and the zip, a simple google search showed only one guy with his name in that part of the state he lives in. Im now utterly confused. I called and he admitted to depositing over &quot;1900.00&quot; in moneyorders today..so it could be him, but now this news about his account being sold..Im confused entierly..please PM me and I will give you the info I have for him and the google info I pulled on him and how I got him to admit to depositing the money... I would greatly appreciate your help. If anything I would like to get myself and others money back...This should NOT be allowed on SR..guess these are pirate rules..sink or swim..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
