				So I put in an order Friday evening and today had a msg from SR support saying my order was cancelled and money refunded. Possible reasons? Does this mean I cannot order from this seller in the future?

				Shoot the seller a PM, ask what the deal is. <br /><br />It happens on occasion, could be anything. It likely has nothing to do with you, unless your purchasing stats are total shit. PM the seller.

				yea that does suck, luckily you didn&#039;t lose too much. I think it just means the seller cancelled your order, nothing serious.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone know if your order is unhedged and at the time of purchase the exchange rate was say 98usd = 1btc and then you or the seller cancelled the order when the exchange rate was 108usd = 1btc you would have more money than when you started? and vice versa?&nbsp;
