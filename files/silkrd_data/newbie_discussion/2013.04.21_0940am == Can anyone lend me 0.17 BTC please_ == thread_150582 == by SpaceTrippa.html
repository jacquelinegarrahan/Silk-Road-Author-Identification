				Hello everybody!<br /><br />I&#039;d like to make a purchase here on the road but I&#039;m short 0.17 BTC. I cannot buy any further Bitcoins today because the exchange site I&#039;m usually using is temporarily down. I am going to pay the money back right when I have my BTC stock refilled next week I guess. I&#039;d really appreciate if someone please helped me out. My SR user name is &quot;BlackID&quot; and my wallet address &quot;15aNdsm88CxrbrUvmePXDNaqRmrLVMLGzt&quot;.<br /><br />Thank you very much in advance!<br /><br />Greetz,<br />SpaceTrippa<br />

				Not for nothin dude, but thats like $25. This is your 1st post and nobody knows you. That IS asking for a lot of faith to be put in a stranger&nbsp; , especially someone who&#039;s prolly lookin to buy drugs . Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m as much as a fiend as anyone, and with being a fiend, I/we know how dishonest many, not all, but many people are when in need.&nbsp; Maybe posting your buyer stats might give some insight into your character? Maybe not.&nbsp; Ya might at least try offering a little vig when payback time comes around. I&#039;m not trying to bust yer balls, just saying......<br />Good Luck
