				I tried and failed in my attempt to crush and snort an original Oxycontin, the one&#039;s labled OC and not OP.<br />I took 1 pick, smashed it up with a hammer in a ziplock bag and then even used a razor blade to try and get the powder finer. I picked out as many green bits as I could.<br />Then, I lined it up and used a straw to snot, but all it did was burn, I had a real bitter taste in my mouth and long story short, wound up wasting a perfect good Oxy<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that I did many thing incorrectly.<br />If anyone could let me know what I did wrong and also what steps I should take next time to avoid wasting another one.<br />I would really appreciate any help from people who have successfully snorted Oxy&#039;s before.<br /><br />Thanks in advance to anyone who helps!

				The outer coating is pretty easy to remove. Place the pill in your mouth for a few seconds and cover it with saliva. Remove it and use a tissue or piece of paper to wipe away the outer coating. Then all that&#039;s left to do is crush it up as finely as you want it. You&#039;re snorting a substance. It will not be comfortable.<br /><br />Be sure to let it dry prior to crushing after removing the coating.
