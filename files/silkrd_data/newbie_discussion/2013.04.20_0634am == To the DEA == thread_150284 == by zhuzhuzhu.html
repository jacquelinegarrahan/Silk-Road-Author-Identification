				Title: <strong>To the DEA</strong><br />

				With the troll/psyops post causing panic I thought I&#039;d offer my thoughts to the sir or madam from the DEA. Warning this is probably tl;dr for most and I am quite high on various psychotropic substances so I cannot vouch for integrity of my grammattic ability at present. That being said here are my thoughts, I hope you enjoy them.<br /><br />Dear DEA: You are the appendix of this collective body we call society. You have become inflamed and threaten the health and well being of the whole. You are being cut out state by state and one day you will be removed completely if you do not find a healthy place to fit in. Instead of towing this tired just say no drug free America prohibitionist fantasy line you need to rethink your priorities. Is making our country drug free worth destroying it? Not physical destruction, though that is a possibility, but rather the destruction of its spirit. America was founded upon the spirit of sanctity of the individual. That we the people should be free to choose our own path to happiness without stipulations, like it can&#039;t be induced by external chemicals rather than endochemicals. Even if others disagree it is our right as human beings to pursue our own path. Even if that path leads to personal destruction it is our right. <br /><br />If you truly wish to reduce the harm of drugs on society prohibition is not the way. Education, better access to rehabilitation, better reintegration, access to clean needles, quality control of substances, regulation and age requirements. These things work far better than putting non-violent people in prison. By putting non-violent offenders who were only harming themselves in prison it causes the public at large to lose respect for law enforcement. We see this divide grow wider every year, month and day. Police becoming militarized and having an us vs them mentality. Beating and shooting innocent people often for no real reason and without provocation. This is the real and human cost of your unjust and illogical war. Innocent people dying for no reason. I don&#039;t believe in life after death but if there is a hell I have no doubt each and every one of you that supported this war in full conscience of the harms will be there. A just God would not accept the Nuremburg defense. I was following orders does not excuse your crimes against humanity on Earth and you have committed many. Stop now because whether you realize it or not this destruction you bring against your fellow man doesn&#039;t destroy him so much as it destroys you. <br /><br />Why do you think LEAP was formed? It is because suddenly these police, prosecuters, judges and politicians learned to use logic? No that idea is complete nonsense. What happened is they saw the real costs of this war and had a conscience. They saw that by having a hand in something so unjust they were destroying their own spirits and even collectively the spirit of America, by arresting and prosecuting people who have committed no act of evil against their fellow man. Destroying lives and families just so they could repeat some banal meme invented by a mediocre mind to win political points for a even worse intellect. They hurt their fellow man but in the process hurt themselves worse than they could have imagined. The people that were arrested and prosecuted get out of jail eventually. You however will have a prison without bars yet cannot be escaped. A prison in your mind made of the evils you committed and your conscience will be your warden. <br /><br />Despite the evils you have committed in the name of whatever excuse you prefer, we the drug using and selling community welcome you back into society. Welcome you to become real fully integrated humans again that support your fellow beings in this endeavor that we call life. In a free society we must support everyone&#039;s freedom to make their own choices, even those we disagree with, as long as it does not harm another. That is the spirit of America and we must keep that spirit alive. We have seen the alternative; Communist China, USSR, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany. That spirit used to shine as a beacon in the darkness. Now it is flickering like a candle in a storm. Don&#039;t let the light of freedom go out. Do not let the spirit of America die.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.
