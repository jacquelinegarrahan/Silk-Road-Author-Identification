				So last night i got PM as followed<br /><br />Greetings,<br /><br />Silk Road has decided to move on with a new venture, a new Silk Road. We have listened to sellers feedback from here and the forums and with the amount of buyer scams on the rise we have decided to act. On the 1st of April we will be launching Silk Road 2.0 as a separate site to the main site. This site will be invite only and work on a web of trust method.<br /><br />As one of our high ranking, trusted sellers we are inviting you to participate and be amongst the few to join. Sellers will be recruited from the main site when we feel they have gained our trust that they are reputable sellers. Buyers will in the first instance be recruited on their seller stats (min 6 months, minimal refund &amp; auto finalize, $1500+ sales) thereafter they will only be invited by you, the sellers. This will be the web of trust working to best effect.<br /><br />We will have a quick ban policy on any scams or scammers and they will not be able to re-join for at least 3 months (If invited again) We are hoping to provide a safer, more productive site for you, our trusted sellers. We also hope because of the way the site will work we will see a better community evolve, and larger deals being able to be placed. Silk Road will still run in conjunction with Silk Road 2.0<br /><br />The Site is due to go live on the 31st of March 2013 with an announcement on the forum at the same time, the reason we have kept it quiet so far is that we expect a lot of debate about the site on the forum as until sellers begin to invite their customers the people allowed to join will be limited. We ask that you do not mention it to your customers until this time.<br /><br />As a trusted vendor the fee for joining with this invite is 2btc (~$100) after the 1st of April the fee will be the same as the main site. Your unique btc address to send the payment to is 17UcDKHtusuSijELtFxqpw2p8dYFvQARuU<br /><br />Once the payment has been matched and confirmed you will receive the address of the new page with a link to register and build your store. please do not release the address until after 31st March.<br /><br /><br />We hope you join us in this new and exciting venture<br /><br /><br />Silk Road Admin

				Then i got this <br />Dear brainfreeze,<br /><br />This is an automated message to all sellers at Silk Road :<br /><br />A message has been sent to many vendors claiming that a new Silk Road is being launched and you must send 2 btc to remain a vendor. This is a scam and you should NOT send any money to this address.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Silk Road Vendor Support

				What the bloody hell is wrong with people, here at SR we have something very, very special place, a place you can come and buy great quality stuff and so far for me nice and safely. I would never uy from the streets anymore, and yet you got total wankers out their scamming. Why try and destroy something so good, this site can be so good and i think SR should try and do more to stop it and protect honest people vendors and buyers. I&nbsp; dont know how they can but they must.<br />If you want to see my page you can find me here&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0319a1315a im UK to UK only vendor friendly and safe stuff thats always tested&nbsp;
