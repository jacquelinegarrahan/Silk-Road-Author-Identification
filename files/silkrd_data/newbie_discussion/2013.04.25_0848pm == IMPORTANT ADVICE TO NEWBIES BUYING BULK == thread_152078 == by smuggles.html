				I&#039;ve been on the silk road for a little over a year. I don&#039;t usually post in these forums, because I like to stay low key. I&#039;m not interested in the petty drama or people crying over their 1 gram purchase. However, I know a lot of you are like me and looking for bulk ketamine or other products. Yes, getting a gram or two is a cake walk. In fact in my experience getting even 50g on here that actually arrives and is good quality is a walk in the park. However, those of you looking to pick up 250g-1kg you will be fighting every step of the way. There are a lot of bad vendors on here, which took me by surprise last year. So far I&#039;ve dumped over 40k onto this market with good and bad results. This is what I&#039;ve found out the hard way:<br /><br />1. DON&#039;T TRUST FEEDBACK: If you look a lot of the vendors feedback, it is mostly if not all people who finalized early. Vendors hold everyone hostage on here to give 5/5 or end up on a blacklist as a scammer and tell the rest of the vendors not to deal with you, regardless of quality, no ships, etc. 5/5 is excellent service. However, if you look at the actual comments people will complain about the service and sometimes not even recieve products and still give 5/5 hoping to get their money back. I&#039;ve been there myself, but now I refuse to be the one. If you need a refund that is not excellent service. You actually get a bad mark for getting a refund on here and it makes vendors suspicious of you. That is poor service anywhere else in the world including the drug market. If you leave a dishonest score for the vendors benefit you are cheating yourself, contributing to the large amount of scammers on here, and disempowering the buyers. If someone gives you bad product, delays shipping, or does not send the product leave a realistic score for them. They won&#039;t blacklist you. It&#039;s an empty threat. <br /><br />2. NEVER FINALIZE EARLY: Vendors will tell you to &#039;FE&#039;, because of your stats. You don&#039;t have a history and they want to &#039;protect themselves&#039; from being &#039;scammed&#039; or you got a refund from a vendor who gave you bad service and they are saying that they are aftraid you are a scammer. As a new user you will most likely fall for this, trusting the feedback. Don&#039;t. I lost $14,000 the first time I came on here to GOOGLEDEYED on buying a kg of Ketamine. He told me that it was shipped UK, which is not a designated drug country and guaranteed 100% reship. In reality it was sent from India (Flagged country) and it got caught by customs of course. He never sent the reship and cut off communication. Every transaction after I have not FE&#039;d and when they went sideways I was thankful, because SR staff could oversee the process to make sure I&#039;m protected as a buyer. The system is there for a reason.<br /><br />3. DON&#039;T TRUST MIDDLEMEN: Learn to identify who&#039;s sending direct and who&#039;s taking your money to send it to another country. PILLPOPPERZ and GOOGLEDEYED are examples of middlemen. There are others on here I thankfully figured out were middlemen before I did business with them, but since I have not purchased from them, so I will not put their names out there. Middlemen will have you FE and then they will take the money and order it from someone else in India or Pakistan. Just like your shady friend of a friend on the street who asks for your money to go around the corner and pick up product for you and does not return or gives you bad product. <br /><br />They send your personal information to people you have not communicated with, so they can fulfill the order. If it doesn&#039;t make it they will cut off contact or give you a hard time on refunding you if you did not FE. Middlemen just like on the street are not real wholesalers or professionals. They don&#039;t even have enough money to purchase the product they are selling. You can&#039;t communicate with the actual supplier so you are playing the telephone game the entire time. If the quality is bad, the package does not arrive, or it is light, they will pass the responsibility to vague outside influences. Example of PILLPOPPERZ is he sent weak ketamine and only sent part of the order. It came again from a designated drug country: India. The part he did send was 10grams light and weak. The other 250g package I never recieved a tracking number for an entire month. He kept saying that the police was after his supplier and he was running around like a fugitive with my package trying to send it for an entire month, till I finally told him I wanted a refund. Again, because I didn&#039;t FE I got my money back.<br /><br />4. RESEARCH YOUR NEW SUPPLIER: Don&#039;t just go through the menu, see an unbelievable price, and jump on it. Bad move. This is a lot of money and a serious business relationship you are initiating. All of us are in a rush to get pipelines up that are down, find someone with better quality than your current supplier, or get a fairer price. However, some scammers are on here posting unbelievable prices and asking you to FE. They will send out smaller orders to get their feedback up and turn around and walk off with the large orders. They won&#039;t care about the account being closed, because they will just make a new one. Research the vendor on the forums first. Remember just because someone said something bad about them, doesn&#039;t make them a scammer. This is drug dealing. There are always conflicts and issues and people can blow them out of proportion. There&#039;s names I put in here to as a warning, don&#039;t believe me. Check for yourself. See if the vendor responds to the person openly on the forum and judge for yourself who&#039;s right. Look for corroborating evidence. If there are scores of people saying the same thing, it is most likely true. <br /><br />5. INTERVIEW YOUR SUPPLIER: There is a twisted logic on Silk Road that you are at the mercy of the vendor. This is not a reality unless you make it so. Remember if you give undeserved feedback or FE you are putting yourself at risk of losing money, and contributing to the growing amount of vendors who scam or selectively scam people. Bulk buyers are at the highest risk for this. Vendors might fulfill orders for small customers with ease all day long. However, when you show up with several thousand dollars it turns into a whole new game. You wouldn&#039;t trust someone with several thousand dollars just because some drug users that buy 20 bucks worth of smack said he was a stand up guy in real life, so don&#039;t do it here. Interview the vendor. Ask them when you will recieve the tracking number once the orders made. Ask them what country it&#039;s being sent from and if they are personally handling the package. Tell them your country and ask them their success rate in sending there. Fact check all of it. Information is important. If they ask you to FE tell them you are uncomfortable with that arrangement and ask them why they would want to circumvent the process. SR staff reviews refunds and there should be a tracking number for your shipment. There is no room on your end to scam them, so if they tell you they are protecting themselves it is bullshit. If they want to get into the bulk game, they need a proven track record of bulk orders for you to trust them or they need to keep the money in escrow till it arrives.<br /><br />I am currently doing business with another bulk vendor on here for Ketamine and MDMA. I am not going to promote or give negative reviews yet, because it is too early. However, as soon as we have done a few more orders with him I will let you guys know if he is a trusted vendor. I would appreciate other reviews here of BULK vendors not small orders (we have plenty of those already). Good luck out there and don&#039;t get caught.<br /><br />-Smuggles

				Hey, great post, full of wise advice. I&#039;ve bought bulk cannabis here a few times so I thought I could share my experiences. First order was La fuente, qp of weed, guy was friendly but convinced to FE because of stats (was my 2nd purchase), I did and it arrived about 28 days later, no problems, except it came it four different packages, which seemed risky and unnecessary. Anyway, ordered from him again, HP of weed, very good price but he said for this price he can&#039;t wait a month for payment so everyone must FE, so I did. No problems, about same delivery time, all good, and in only two diff packages this time. Next was smaller, 2ozs from swazibud, waiting over 30 days, went to resolution, got 50%, fair enough (plus it wasn&#039;t hedged so I got back like double the dollar value of the purchase), I did give him 5/5 though, I didn&#039;t believe I was scammed but no customs letter or anything ever came. Next got a QP of cannabis from CaliforniaCannibas, he said I&#039;d have to FE because he had only shipped bulk domestically before and was wary of getting scammed, I foolishly complied again, however in just 6 days it arrived beautifully. Also got another half lb from La fuente, express shipping, didn&#039;t FE, arrived in about 14 days no problems.<br />Dont know if my experiences so far are of use to anyone but,, fuck, im stoned&nbsp; 8)

				There are some vendors that you will FE with and they will send it. Even middlemen sometimes get an order through. However, when you are dealing with several thousand, FE is an expensive roll of the dice. The vendors I&#039;ve gotten ripped off from are all above 90% on the feedback scale. The ones I chose not to do business with because of other bulk customers I found out they ripped off are also above 90%. There&#039;s one right now I was communicating with, that fortunatly I researched in the forums. He had 4 accounts suspended, yet had a new one with 100% feedback. It&#039;s important to be careful out there. Hopefully we can change buyers from being helpless to being more empowered. As it is you are at the mercy of the vendors. Circumventing escrow and feedback has become expected and that should never be the case. Why even have escrow or feedback if buyers are forced to circumvent escrow and lie on the feedback in the initial email sent to them by the vendor?

				I just got done talking to ITALY. He is offering Ketamine and MDMA in bulk at ridiculously low prices right now, so I decided to contact him. He dodged my questions and lied to me telling me he had experience sending bulk to my country. I looked on his feedback for his bulk and he had no customers at all let alone from my country. I went on the forums to research him and found him admitting to being four other accounts. I confronted him with all of this and told him to answer my questions. I told him I wouldn&#039;t FE so don&#039;t bother asking and that customers on my level aren&#039;t idiots which is why he has no customers moving kilos. He said I would have to FE because he doesn&#039;t have the money to pay the factory. What a joke. How can you do a reship if you don&#039;t even have the money to buy the product in the first place? I told him not to waste my time.<br /><br />Buyers have the power here. Especially bulk buyers. Don&#039;t get scammed or let these scammers lie to you and play games. Call them out right there. If everyone just FEs and gives perfect feedback after getting treated like dirt you will make terrible vendors into the norm here. I&#039;m glad people are starting to get wise.

				Nice post, honestly I&#039;m starting to look into bulk buying even though I haven&#039;t got much into it. Also looking into MDMA mostly (huge in my area). If you&#039;d give insight into who you&#039;re using through either PMs or anything so I don&#039;t have to do all of the grunt work (if you&#039;re shipping domestically US) that&#039;d be awesome. But thank you for the advice.

				I ordered a 100g sample of mdma and Ket from OA. I will let you know quality when it arrives. This guy seems pretty legit in comparison to a lot of the vendors on here, though the real test is when I go for the large order.

				Let us know how it goes with Abzu and the 100g. I also was going to do business with Charasbros till I read the forums. Glad you saw that before you ended up getting ripped off.

				Yeah, currently going thru this... Actually, FE my first two orders here no problems.<br /><br />Placed a 2nd order with one vendor, over 30 days and nothing. No FE.<br /><br />Placed an order with another vendor (first time ordering) and still haven&#039;t rec&#039;d.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if NOT FEing has affected me here... First two orders were fine, now I&#039;m in one open dispute and waiting for response from another.

				Im writing in this thread because i cant post in anywhere else just yet. I got burned by hollymolly on a 250g package. Already ordered a 50g batch that arrived fine and went in for the 250g. I was asked to FE because of an issue they had and they wouldnt ship to me in aus if i didnt. Finalized early and all contact was lost, i have sent about 10 messages, none read or replied to<br /><br />Im not new to SR but i fell into the trap of FE and i think i have lost 5K if holly doesnt pull through
