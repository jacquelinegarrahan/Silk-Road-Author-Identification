				not sure where your based, but in the uk localbitcoins.com is good. <br />you can either meet someone selling coins in person or wire money.<br />you do this based on their previous rep. can&#039;t guarantee it&#039;s 100% safe but it has worked for me.

				I use bitinstant when localbitcoins doesn&#039;t come through. I do kind of hate the rate, but there really isn&#039;t any great way of turning cash into bitcoins that I&#039;ve found... that either isn&#039;t reliant on people that aren&#039;t necessarily vested in the situation, or doesn&#039;t have a high exchange rate. That being said, 3% is better than the 10% i tend to see for reloadit transfers.

They use an external service (its called CashPayment, http://www.cashpayment.com &lt;-- clearnet). You specify the transaction you want, ie: cash to bitcoin address. In the list of &quot;cash&quot; there are a few places you can select, like Walmart or CVS. It&#039;ll give you a receipt that has the information that you use when you go to the counter in order to send money. If you use Walmart, for example, it&#039;d be moneygram. The company that handles it - cashpayment - has a few methods that are dependent on location and where you go to actually do the money transfer.<br /><br />The 3.99% is the fee. If you look on the bitinstant site, there is a spot that gives you fees and location information - if you scroll down to the ZipZap section, that is the one that deals with Cash. ZipZap is the parent company that owns and runs CashPayment.

				You should also remember that using the cash service includes both the 3.99% fee from bitinstant/zipzap, and the fees from the service you use, ie moneygram. So, if you do say, $200 - it&#039;ll cost you $212 to send at moneygram in walmart, plus 3.99% fees on the bitinstant transfer, so you are going to end up with $192 (4% of 200 is $8) plus the $12 you spent at money gram. Thats $20 total, so you hit like 10% at that point, if you consider the original amount you wanted to send.

				<br />I use bitcoinnordic.com, commissions are a bit steep, but service is fast and easy.<br /><br />you can use CashU or you can wire-transfer from your bank-account.<br /><br />Personally I use wire-transfer then move the coins to blockchain first and then depending on your level of paranoia you can move them through some wallets, I send them straight from blockchain to SR - SR tumbles them anyway and it is not illegal to have bitcoins in SR after-all you can buy non-contraband stuff there if you look carefully ;-)<br /><br />I am not so prone to paranoia - first of all I am banking in 3 different countries, one of them being Hong Kong (yeah it is China but still a special region) the others two European countries and I don&#039;t live in either of these countries - so I am opting that wire-transfer is quite OK - if LE wants to pursue my transactions it requires a hell of a joint effort globally<br />and if they do that I am pretty sure I am not the one they would be chasing for buying coke in smaller amounts for personal use.<br /><br />Anyway it works like a charm for me and requires no ID or anything else for that matter.<br />
