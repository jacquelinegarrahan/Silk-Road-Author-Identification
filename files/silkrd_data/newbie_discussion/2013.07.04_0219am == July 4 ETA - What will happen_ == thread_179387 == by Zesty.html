				So it &#039;would&#039; be here tomorrow. I always get my stuff from this guy 2 days after he marks it in transit, but USPS does not deliver on holidays. My question is what will happen to the package? Will it be left in the post office over the holiday and be delivered the next day? I know it&#039;s bad when things &#039;sit&#039; at the office over the weekend, but I&#039;m not sure about holidays.<br /><br />Thank you all in advance for replying.

				I&#039;m far more worried when my packages are in the mail truck baking in 100 degree heat. Thankfully my mailman comes early in the morning and I know him by name. He brought my package to my door today. Freaked me out at first but he was just being nice and didn&#039;t ask for a sig. It will sit for one extra day in an air conditioned sorting facility. Doubt it will be a problem. I got some buds today that stunk up the entire room when opened and you couldn&#039;t smell a damn thing before I cut open the package.&nbsp;

				Looks like it didn&#039;t get here today, which is absolutely the strangest thing of all.<br /><br />I guess perhaps they might have held it somewhere else on the fourth and not the nearby office, but jeesh.

				Yeah it looks like the guy who I usually get my coins from cashed out. I expect he took back his vendor bond for a short period so he might be able to salvage it&#039;s value.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t hold coins for a long time. As long as you get your coins and order in ASAP the drugs will still be the same price.
