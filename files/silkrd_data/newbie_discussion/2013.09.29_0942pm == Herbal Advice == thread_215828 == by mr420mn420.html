				Hey there fellow travelers of the SR. I was hoping I could get some input about pot.&nbsp; I am starting my first round of chemo next week and I wanted to know if anyone had any strains, vendors they could recommend here on SR would be appreciated. I intend to fight this all or nothing! I am not in a state that has recognized the power of marijuana, so I turned to the one place where I knew I could get help and support. Thank you<br /><br /><br /><br />Mr420&lt;---- you would think with a handle like that, that I wouldn&#039;t need any help. ;)

				First, look for a reputable vendor with an indica-dominant strain. You want about a 1:1 THC-CBD ratio.<br /><br />I recommend Farmer1.<br />Strains- kush types, purple types, sour diesel is decent for pain relief, personally I prefer some sativa, but for cancer benefits you want something that is reviewed as &quot;heavy stone&quot; types, as the CBD compound is responsible for this, and also has a fair bit of the anti-cancer properties. <br /><br />Second- if you have the money-<br />Look into rick simpson oil.&nbsp; Make it yourself if you can. <br /><br />Third- Get a vaporizer. I recommend a magic flight launch box if you are a bit strapped for cash, a volcano if you aren&#039;t.&nbsp; Magic flight is really nice IMHO, doesn&#039;t give the biggest hits which is okay if you don&#039;t have a tolerance, and has the benefit of being just about the most discreet way to smoke. I smoke all the time in a bathroom with the fart-fan on and unless I open a sack of stinky weed and leave it open, e.g have the flight box prepacked, I can peruse without anyone knowing unless I tell them.

				On the subject of Vaporizers, I would choose a Herbalaire over a Volcano... I never really saw the appeal of them aside from the design.<br /><br />The Herbalaire allows you to fill up bags with your medicine or direct draw straight from the unit or Filter through a Bong. It is also about half the price of a Volcano and saves you having to grind into a powder before use. If you are in need of something portable, all the resources on the net seem to suggest that an Arizer Solo is one of the best units around. I am planning on buying one of those this week for the car and at friends houses.<br /><br />The Magic Flight Launch Box, from what I&#039;ve heard, is a very good discreet and portable vaporizer, however it is very easy to combust your materials instead of heating them up to the correct Vaporization temperature (which, while we are on the subject is about 190-200 Celsius) as they do not have a built in temperature controller, it is down to you inserting and removing the battery at the right times. <br /><br />If you are not a recreational user, I doubt you will care much about the &quot;stoned&quot; feeling, but just in case, and for anyone reading this who is interested, Vaporizers produce a very different type of high, it is much more cerebral, more of a head high and you will want to use a higher grade plant in them to produce big clouds of intoxicating, healing, delicious vapor.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t recommend any good domestic vendors for you as I&#039;m not from the US but I will advise you to check the vendors feedback, never FE on a large order if you can&#039;t afford to lose it and most of all enjoy! If you have any questions about herbs or vapes, feel free to ask. I wish you the best of luck with your treatment and with your travels down the Silk Road.

				Hmm, will have to check out the herbalaire.<br /><br />Also- if you go the vape route, remember to save the &quot;popcorn&quot; or ABV- already been vaped, this can be used in edibles without having to &quot;activate&quot; them using heat, as they already have been heated! <br />In addition, if you need the &quot;stoney&quot; high from a vape, just crank the heat north of recommended, it provides a good stone. <br /><br />Re: the MFLB combusting easily, it does take practice, if the smoke is a bit more moist it is hard, but with good, dry smoke it will combust somewhat easily.&nbsp; After you get used to it it is quite easy, you feel the heat on your lips, and hot lips equal burnt smoke. <br /><br />Can&#039;t recommend farmer1 enough for a US vendor, esp for indica.&nbsp; NorCalKing is a good guy as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I know this is blasphemy, but CaliBud from BMR-&nbsp; http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/<br />is a good source for bulk stuff.
