				Obvious rant is obvious but I&#039;ve read so much stuff about people wanting their drugs for free.<br /><br />This stuff is illegal. I simply don&#039;t want just anyone to mail me drugs.<br /><br />#1 Security of the packaging<br />#2 Drug Quality<br />#3 Don&#039;t want someone giving away drugs to have my address<br /><br />So the bottom line is pay for your fucking drugs. If you can&#039;t pay for them -then maybe it&#039;s a sign that you should quit doing drugs and find a job that pays.

				What if I offer someone a few free Vicodin to teach me pro shipping techniques? If you&#039;re a pro buyer you most likely have a PMB (private mail box) anyway so your personal address would not be compromised.

				I&#039;ve only ever and will only ever accept drugs for free under these conditions:<br /><br />1. I must not know what the drug is.<br /><br />2. It must be able to be taken orally.<br /><br />3. The person giving me the free drug must be a stranger.<br /><br />4. They must place abovementioned free drugs directly on my tongue.<br /><br />It&#039;s just no fun if you don&#039;t follow this code.<br />

				Here to play devils advocate a bit. I have done quite a few samples for review for new vendors, and maybe I&#039;ve just been lucky, but those orders have almost always had some of the best quality packaging and awesome drugs. I think many new vendors have something to prove when they are doing samples, and actually put a lot of effort in. I only order domestic, so I don&#039;t have to worry about unknown packs coming to me through customs. The worst packaging and quality has actually been from well known vendors with high ratings, possibly it&#039;s that they know they&#039;ve got business so they get a bit lazy, or get overwhelmed with orders and can&#039;t keep up. Always encrypt your address and don&#039;t go too trigger happy with ordering tons of samples and it&#039;s reasonably safe.

				The most important reason is free drugs can lead to vendor address harvesting.
