				Hi all just wanted to share some thoughts on a BTC vendor, CryptoKeeper.&nbsp; I have only made one purchase with him in the pat an it was a bit rocky.&nbsp; This was about a month or two ago.&nbsp; I got my coins at an awesome rate but it took a long time and there was almost no communication.&nbsp; Upon reading his latest review I decided to give him another go.&nbsp; I made the order yesterday and that night he sent out a message to all his customers say that he had run into some problems and that there would be a short delay.&nbsp; Just with this he went up a couple notches in my book.&nbsp; He could have just made us all wait and left it at that but he took the time to keep his customers updated. Very cool.&nbsp; Plus, at only 7% his rate is awesome.&nbsp; I don&#039;t buy large quantity&#039;s of BTC at one time so just the fact that he is willing to process a 100$ MP is awesome.&nbsp; Not to mention his rates do not go up for smaller denominations.&nbsp; Some vendors charge anywhere from 10-40% for small amounts for BTC like that.&nbsp; He let me know that he will hopefully get me my coins by tonight which is great.&nbsp; I will update on how fast my coins get to me.&nbsp; All in all I think this BTC is a keeper and he will be in my &quot;favorites&quot; list as long as he keeps this kind of service up!<br /><br /><br />Much love,<br />Goose

				Imagine how nice it would be if someone actually followed up and posted an update on how things worked out. I can&#039;t see putting my trust in someone that is less than a month old with all newbies vouching for them especially when they really do not update on how things went in the end.

				It would be better practice to wait till an order is 100% complete to promote a vendor. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t even consider promoting a vendor unless they offer exceptional services:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have only made one purchase with him in the pat an it was a bit rocky....

Communication is a big one for me. It illustrates that the vendor is truly applying themselves to their business. Communication is essential to customer relations which leads to future sales. <br /><br />There have been 3 threads on Cryptokeeper on the front page of Newbie discussion and I can honestly say I would never consider doing business with that vendor, ever.
