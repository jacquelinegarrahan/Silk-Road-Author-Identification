				So I am one of a numerous amount of people who have been bitten by the disappearance of one the roads previously glorious vendors. K Queen.<br /><br />I am hoping the community can come together and donate small amounts of BTC to help those who have been burnt.<br /><br />So please, if you have been genuinely affected by this post here with your bit coin address of choice and let the good-will of the community (hopefully) repay some of what you&#039;ve lost.<br /><br /><br />Thanks very much for anything you can spare.

				... I&#039;ll start.<br /><br />I lost Â£25 worth of BTC in one transaction. I am not wealthy and would greatly appreciate any donations you can offer.<br /><br />If I receive my outlay back in donations I will post here to say so.<br /><br />Thanks again.

				Yes, I was told by K Queen to FE because my order history was less than 10 transactions.<br /><br />It appears that around 1-2 weeks ago, the vendor requested that all international customers FE too, and now she has vanished with all of our money.<br /><br />Lessons learnt.

				That rule will now be sacrosanct for me. <br /><br />The mistake I made was to trust a vendor I had previous, smooth transactions with, who changed their T&#039;s and C&#039;s for seemingly legitimate reasons. So yes, no matter how much of a legend the vendor seems to be, don&#039;t break rule number 1.

				If you don&#039;t FE, and then the vendor disappears with your money or something, so you go into resolution to get the money back, does that blemish your buyer history and make it less likely for future sellers to sell to you?

				If you didnt FE the vendor didnt disappear with your money then did they.&nbsp; I think it does still show up as a refund though im not sure but cant see why it wouldnt. Ask SR staff in resolve they can answer that better
