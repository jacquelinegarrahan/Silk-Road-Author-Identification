				I&#039;ve recently been scammed by Emerald and narcocrew and this has put me off from using SR, at the same time I have received a much better treatment on Atlantis. I don&#039;t know what SR makes about this, but I&#039;m sure these vendors won&#039;t be praised for what they do. Even though these guys have apparently good reviews, remember there are ways of keeping statistics high and a scam every now and then may go unnoticed.

				How could you have been scammed? you don&#039;t give them the money until you get your stuff?<br /><br />Unless you mean you finalised early, in that case it is your own fault in doing it not once but twice.

Now I have made it my prime objective to make sure these people lose as many customers as possible. Remember that a 50% refund is also a scam because you spent 100 and only got 50 back. Now you can make your own conclusions.....

				I still don&#039;t get it. If you have not finalised early then you can get all your money back from SR resolution as that is what it is there for.<br /><br />You do not have to accept a 50% refund especially if one of the vendors have stopped trading, SR admin take all this into account when doing the resolution. If you accepted the 50% then that is your fault, I really don&#039;t see how you can be scammed here especially if you did not FE.
