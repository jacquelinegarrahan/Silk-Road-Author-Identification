				You might be a newb but you can still vendor review...in the the Newbie Discussion board.<br /><br />Anyhoo thought I write a review for the LSD seller Drugsbunnies. When doing research I couldn&#039;t find anything recent about their tabs on the forums, so&nbsp; here&#039;s an attempt to amend that.<br /><br />Bought a bunch of Drugsbunnies 100-110ug&nbsp; white fluff LSD tabs. They arrived reasonably quickly and when the seller said they would. Stealth was...well I&#039;m able to type this review so clearly the stealth worked. <br />However, this acid is very mild, I had two tabs and was just feeling it. I mean the trip was enjoyable but not particularly psychedelic or intense. Just some mild sensory intensity type stuff, and a bit of visuals (walls melting/patterns).<br />These were priced at around $27 which is kind standard for this sellers country but overpriced for strength. Very pleased (and annoyed :P) to see that the prices have decreased considerably since then.<br /><br />All in all, good communication, mild product but good to see they&#039;re adjusting prices accordingly. It would be nice to see a bit more Drugsbunnies when you search the forums.<br />

				True, the ominous absence of reviews and also activity on their behalf is a little unnerving, and confusing, considering they&#039;ve been around for a while now, they have a moderately high fan-count, and they have products with great prices.<br /><br />I received mine a few days ago, and just tried them today. For the most part, the only feedback I&#039;ve seen is that their acid is extremely weak, but their communication and resolution diligence is great. I just dropped 1 tab about 30 minutes ago (just testing with 1, as I have a very low tolerance to psychedelics, doesn&#039;t take much to get me whacked), and just sitting around waiting to see if anything happens.<br /><br />Postage and communication 10/10 though, they were quick and very laid back. Thanks for that at least guys, will let you know how acid goes

				Ive heard LSD needs to be stored in a dry cool and dark space or it loses potency. maybe a loss in the potency is a result of shipping. anyway, enjoy your trip!
