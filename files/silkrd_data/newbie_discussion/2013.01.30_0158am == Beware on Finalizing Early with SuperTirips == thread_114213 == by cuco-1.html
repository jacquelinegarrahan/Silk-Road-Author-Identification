				You should not have to F/E with any seller. I did not F/E late last year and thankfully&nbsp; re-couped 1/2 my btc&#039;s of an order that never arrived<br /><br />I was told in no uncertain terms I could not get the 100% refund.&nbsp; To my dismay he said 0% in resolution - wells his profile page does not reflect 0%<br /><br />I did business for some time with this seller and after the November situation things went down hill I did receive 2 shipments and then this shitshow <br /><br />This is not my first kick at the can as I&#039;ve been on SR short of 1 year<br /><br />Just a heads up avoid the aggravation - in the beginning we were in it together now the money&#039;s involved<br /><br />I sense a different business policy with SuperTrips - to which is too bad as we were partner for quite sometime<br /><br />This is my experience - should you not believe -&nbsp; be educated and&nbsp; search the forum

				I ordered enough to stay in escrow but I think you never shipped. He changed my order status 20 minutes before I was able to cancel and nothing in my mailbox and he does not reply to my PN. I hope I will get 100% refunded by SR.

				ID STAY AWAY FROM SUPERTRIPS ALL TOGETHER. You just do not know what is going on with him cus his operations are so large. In the past month there have not been many people saying they&#039;ve received from him im in on a tracked order. Day 24 i think. Hope it comes.
