				Hi everyone-<br /><br />Just joined by a highly recommended friend but after all the questions I have &amp; he couldn&#039;t answer, I am beginning to think he has never ordered before lol. So here are my questions:<br /><br />1. I see everyone pretty much having orders sent to a PO Box. I currently don&#039;t have one &amp; my mail is sent to my house. Does anyone have cause to feel that this would not be safe? My man has his meds sent VIA mail from VA so I don&#039;t think my mail carrier would be too suspicious, especially if I keep the ordering at a dull roar. <br /><br />2. Does anyone have/know where I can find a bitcoin converter? It&#039;s frustrating because I do not know how much I would actually be paying for some of this stuff.<br /><br />3. I have set up an account with www.localbitcoins.com&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anyone have any advice on where to purchase bitcoins?<br /><br />Thank you in advance; any &amp; all comments/suggestions/opinions are welcome :)

				Sending boxes to your actual address is completely fine. Personally, I&#039;ve had 47 transactions all sent to my home without a single issue. Search under the top sellers and pick and choose from those with the best feedback. <br /><br />As for exchanges, I highly recommend Campbx. I fund my Campbx account from Dwolla, which is linked to my bank. It is a very easy process however, it takes 30 days to receive your first transfer. After this, the transfers are instantaneous.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps a little!

				most of the buyers that order from me use their house address, maybe 10-15% use a PO box.<br /><br />Also you might consider using bitcoin-brokers, I&#039;ve heard positive things about that service from a few of my buyers that needed btc.<br /><br />WAtch out for sr vendors that are new and sell btc for moneypaks. <br />Several have been huge scammers, robbing vendors for thousands, robbing buyers big time!<br /><br />

				bitman.biz&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will get your your btc tinight dude this guy is amazing. he can even put up a custom so you can use the escrow on localbitcoins!<br /><br />i will personally reimburse DOUBLE if you lose anything. thats how sure i am about this guy. i have a vendor acciunt and im saying for everyone to see i will pay you double because im that sure that bitman is a business man who ALWAYS took care of me FAST and im sure he will for everyone. so check it i=out contact him and go through escrow if it makes you more comfortable escrow and a low % you cant go wrong with this guy,please tell him a buddy on a forum told you about him? thanks!

				Hi, welcome to SR!<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually always been under the impression using a PO box is a bad idea.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always just ordered to my address, using my name, and never had any issues.&nbsp; Though I just purchase small amounts for personal use.&nbsp; As long as you are selecting a respected, domestic vendor who is on point with their shipping and stealth, you shouldn&#039;t have any issues.&nbsp; By BTC converter, I&#039;m assuming you mean what the $ value is currently?&nbsp; If you look in the bottom left hand corner of SR when you are logged on it should say 1btc = $x or something simliar, but to make it even easier, in your account settings you can select which currency you want prices to be displayed in so the site will just do the conversion for you.&nbsp; As for purchasing bitcoins, localbitcoins is a good option, especially if you want to pay cash and keep things as anonymous as possible.&nbsp; There are a handful of sites online you can purchase from, Coinbase, campbx, etc, but they all require some kind of linkage to your real identity in some way.&nbsp; If you go that route, it&#039;s a good idea to move the BTC around a few times to addresses that aren&#039;t linked with your identity before finally moving them on to SR.&nbsp; There is a wealth of information regarding all of this in the forums here, spend as much time as you need to read, read, read until you have a firm understanding of how things are working and always feel free to ask questions.&nbsp; Hope I&#039;ve helped a little!<br /><br />D

Copy the encrypting message again from the beginning --- to the end --- ONLY, then paste that as your message.<br /><br />At the top right corner of the site you can click PGP Key Generator to create your own public and private key, you only post your public key on your profile and save your private key and your password for decrypting messages sent to you.<br />
