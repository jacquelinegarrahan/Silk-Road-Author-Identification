				If it all of course.<br /><br />I have been on since 2002 started on the &quot;Marketplace&quot; buying off of people like cannabis4u882, and later farmerval/frenchfrog4u<br /><br />Curious how long others have been aware of this corner of the net. SR has certainly taken things to the next level.

				Been in real life for 10+ years... on Silk Road for 1 year and a few months.<br /><br />Loving every minute of SR (Well, ALMOST every minute.&nbsp; Except when certain vendors decide to send me fake shit).&nbsp;

				Real life since 1995, on SR since 2011. Don&#039;t buy much anywhere else these days.<br />SR is probably one of the best things I have ever found online.

				I was thinking of posting something like this for awhile now to see if there were any other old timers in the midst that have been around the scene before SR was born.&nbsp; Zippybud&nbsp; was my official online cherry popper.&nbsp; I had been trading with online friends over mirc for a few years before that but it wasn&#039;t official vendors like zippybud and then the boom of the MOM scene.&nbsp; I was a member of OPR, The market, Custom News, pharmacyrater (what a shit hole that was) I could go on for days about the MOM and MOD boards i was a member off back in the day lol.&nbsp; Now that i think&nbsp; about it....I&#039;m shocked I&#039;m still alive lol.

				I used the old e-mail/list system in the 90&#039;s.&nbsp; It was a hassle but worked (most of the time).&nbsp; SR is vastly superior and is a pleasure to use.&nbsp; Online dope deals have finally come of age.

				LOL pharmacyrater...jeuss I forgot about that one...what was the name of that one board from around 2008-2009 was run by that Admin who was a huge steroid user and way psycho?<br /><br />But yeah, SR has really brought online drug dealing to a whole new level, I mean you have scammers come up but the amount is far less percentage wise, and it is much easier to figure out who is legit.<br /><br />Without looking into it much I can only speculate it was built by people who had been on the old scene and brainstormed &quot;How can we overcome all the usual BS?&quot; Lord knows I have thought about those kind of things before...

				10 years in real life, mainly just a buyer, 2 months on SR although have used the cesspool that is topix before and scored some good deals.<br />I still use my contacts in the real world to procure some things as they are much cheaper then on here,<br />SR prices are strange, MDMA seems very reasonably priced but Ket is double street price nearly? <br />Anyway its a beautiful thing SR, I hope its around to stay.<br />
