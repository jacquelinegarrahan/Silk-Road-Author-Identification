				Hey everyone. Great community sense here.<br /><br />Anyway, I still got a few questions.<br /><br /><br />1. When I randomly checked some vendors, a certain percentage of them stated they wouldn&#039;t ship to Israel. (I&#039;m from IL). Do you guys know of any policies here that make it not worthwhile for vendors to make business here? Or other reasons? I guess I should know this stuff before I make my first purchase. <br />2. What&#039;s FE?<br />3. Can I filter the results by where it ships to?<br /><br /><br />Thanks!

				What if a rocket hits the mailman, and some little jihadist runs off with your order?<br />That makes it hard to prove scam or not.<br />:)<br />JK<br />I ship anywhere, so I don&#039;t really know why, though I haven&#039;t had any orders to the middle east yet.<br />So far good reviews from Aus, China, Europe and USA, though I charge a little extra for the stealthiness of my pack.

				Hi mate, and welcome to the road!<br /><br />If some vendors do not deliver to your country is becouse or is a called &quot;red flag&quot; country as Marruecos,Afganistan,Netherland,etc.. or is a place where the customs are very effective,and most of the times the packages are been discovered by them.<br /><br />FE it means finalize early, that it means that you pay for the product before have it in your hands, so, you take all the responabilitie and most of them will not refund them,and also Silk Road, will NOT be able to help you.<br />If FE is not requested, when you receive the goods, then you (Silk Road has in escrow )send the money to him.<br /><br />No there is no way to filter that, so be patient, the time worth the price ;)<br /><br />hope I helped you.<br />Peace!!&nbsp;
