				depends what you are looking for. CaliConnect has the best rate per pound. the thing is you get what you pay for so you might end up with some seeds even though it&#039;s advertised as no seeds but he lists his stuff at like 1000/ half pound and even does 3 and 5 pound listings. <br /><br />if you&#039;re looking for top shelf then ill just say good luck, the prices on USA Bulk right now are ridiculous things may change in the upcoming weeks - keep an eye on TopShelf420, they said their indoor harvest will be out around September - they also had some outdoor Green Crack for ~2400/pound not CaliConnect prices but quality is better for sure. <br /><br />BayAreaBudz was always good to me and an overall cool dude. He pops in from time to time and will probably be back more consistently in Sept. last we talked all the indoor vendors were jacking their prices since the outdoor was in low supply, seasonal crop economics. <br /><br />Right now i&#039;m outsourcing to Canada until the USA vendors can get their shit together. like i said,, in the upcoming weeks as the outdoor crops saturate the market the prices of indoor will start to drop. happy hunting.

Overall, I expect prices to drop for hydroponic and outdoor. Outdoor commercial will be stupidly cheap. (Think 50 bucks an ounce)
