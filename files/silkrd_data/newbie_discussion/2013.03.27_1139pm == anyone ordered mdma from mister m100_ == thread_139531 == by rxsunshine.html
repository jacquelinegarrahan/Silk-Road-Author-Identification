				i ALMOST ordered from him last time i did bulk but ended up going with a vendor i knew and trusted... his prices were very competitive, which was the major draw, but I decided against it last minute. def interested to hear from anyone that has done business with him in the past...

				Hi! Just wanted to check in to this thread. I am very new to silk road, so after doing some research I decided to go with mister m100 for my first purchase... Well it just arrived today (very quickly), and WOW am I impressed. The stealth is absolutely incredible; we were laughing as we opened it and realized that mister m100 is truly a professional. Product looks amazing, very excited to try it out this weekend. A+ stealth, speed, and service. Highly recommended.

				I ordered from this guy last week and he unexpectedly canceled my order a couple days later. No explanation. No communication. Interesting way of doing business...

				Try reordering. I also placed another order with him but it was cancelled, I realized it was because the listed price was only in bitcoins, not fiat. So, if this was during the crash, your order would have been placed at a ridiculously low dollar value, and it makes sense that he would not honor those orders. Just try again all the listings are fixed price now.

I&#039;ve also since realized that he got a new pgp key. I had his old one saved. That probably wouldn&#039;t have kept him from sending though, as he could have just emailed me and asked to resend address. Most likely due to btc drop.
