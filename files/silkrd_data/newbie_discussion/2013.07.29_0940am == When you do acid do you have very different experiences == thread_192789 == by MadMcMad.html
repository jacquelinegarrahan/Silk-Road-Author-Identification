				I found that many that tabs I took back in the 80./90&#039;s would vary wildly in their effects. <br /><br />Not necessarily in a strength way but my first half tab took over and hour and a half before going full scale nuclear.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had ones that come really fast but fade fast to<br /><br />Mellow sit down ones. Wild non stop action ones. non stop laughing ones. and ...<br /><br />the ones you find yourself just standing there and 3 hour have gone by without having a clue what just went on.

				From my experience no two acid trips are the same. They share common traits, but they&#039;re all pretty different enough to be categorized into their own experiences. It also is heavily dependent on your dose as well as your setting. On low doses I feel more giggly and on high doses I feel very serious. When I am by myself it feels very introspective, but when I am with friends it feels more recreational.
