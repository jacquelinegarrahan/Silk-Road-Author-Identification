				Jst got a g of H from Marlo Stanfield.<br />I did almost 3 tenths within three separate shots and ended up having to dose a pretty hefty shot of some synthe opiate that a buddy of mine makes on top of that, b/c I wasn&#039;t really feeling high.&nbsp; So, bout 5 to 6 months ago, I got onto SR and ordered a gram from a vendor who&#039;s no longer around.&nbsp; When I got that, I fell out on less than a tenth (some strong shit).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to find the best of the best, but since Smile Awhile went stealth, I&#039;m feeling like a headless chicken. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The synthe opiate I take has a very high opiate content and has boosted my tolerance to the moon.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I got back on SR, b/c anything I could find locally wasn&#039;t even touching me.&nbsp; So I though SR would have dope strong enough to at least give me a fck&#039;n rush anyway.<br />Looks like I was wrong. Like I said, three tenths and no rush.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t be able to take three separate shots at a tenth apiece, and still need other opiates to get me high. <br />So my question.&nbsp; Where&#039;s the good shit.&nbsp; The #4, no taking more than a tenth shit.&nbsp; I mean, real heroin #4 should be strong enough that u can&#039;t take more than a hefty tenth without permanently falling asleep. Is it out there?&nbsp; I&#039;m not gonna go from vendor to vendor spending 200 plus a gram, jst to find the top ranked boy.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t have to do that anyway.&nbsp; I mean, isn&#039;t that part of the reason for these forums.&nbsp; <br />Come on SilkRoadians, help me out here.&nbsp; I prefer to get it domestically (in the US), but will import if I need to.<br />Where&#039;s the best dope on SR right now?&nbsp; The BEST #4 available.<br />Someone plz help.

				I like Tomorrowman myself.... i have a pretty strong tolly thanks to methadone and i usually do 80-100mg shot and get my nice rush chill out for awhile start nodding and wake up a couple hours later hahaha.Never had the chance to try SAW which i hear is the gold standard but i also choose Tman cause his customer service is next level.He is in Canada but ship&#039;s down south and his stealth is great and puts it in th mail when you order not days later...Hope ya find what you are looking for bud either way!!
