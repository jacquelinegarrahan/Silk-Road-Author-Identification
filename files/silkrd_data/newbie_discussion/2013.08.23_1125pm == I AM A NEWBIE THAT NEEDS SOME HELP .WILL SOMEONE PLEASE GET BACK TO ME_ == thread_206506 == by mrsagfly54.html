				You can see your account information and wallet information when you click on &quot;account&quot; where it shows your available bitcoin amount at the top of the page (next to messages and orders).<br />I don&#039;t change my pass/pin every time that I make a deposit. I can&#039;t see why you should either. Someone please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.<br />I would NOT recommend buying bitcoins from a vendor on sr. Too many opportunities for a scam. You can do a simple search here on the forums for suggestions and ways other users buy bitcoins. Localbitcoins is pretty popular. I wouldn&#039;t recommend mtgox however.<br />I&#039;d say you need to do a bit more research here before you make a first purchase....<br />Good luck and don&#039;t finalize early!

				It is suggested that you change your bitcoin address after each transaction, not your password and pin. Achieve this by clicking on the Account link at the top of any SR page, then clicking on the Get New Address link next to your bitcoin address. To purchase coins, I suggest localbitcoins.com. It is not necessary to meet in person to buy coins, though this option is available. But there are many other payment options offered, and your coins are held in escrow by the site so the seller cannot run off with the coins after you&#039;ve made payment.
