				Hey all! Along with the usual security measures taken for receiving orders I have been using an alternative spelling for my name. (Hold on don&#039;t bite my head off yet) All of my orders have showed up so there is no problem with receiving the items. I am thinking that if my package were to be intercepted I could use this as plausible deny-ability saying someone is trying to set me up. Is this a good practice to use if your name allows it? Would like some advice from more experienced members. Thanks and may the Road live long and prosper!&nbsp; ;D

				You&#039;re lucky your packages still arrived!<br /><br />In the end, it is still best to use your real name. Don&#039;t let the paranoia overtake you!&nbsp; ;)

				Where i receive mail i believe the workers sort by box # and use the name to verify its in the right box it is also a real slight change so it reads exactly the same.<br /><br />I blame the paranoia on close calls and drug use&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				I don&#039;t think that you will get off on that technicality as your address, almost same name and if they do bust you they will most likely wait for you get the item cause they cant arrest you for something not in your possession. Why do you think when they do street busts they have to wait to the transaction to be completed before they can rush in and arrest you.

				Not a good idea. Buy from a reputable vendor and take necessary precautions.&nbsp; You just risk having a package not show up and screwing the vendor.

				Lol I used to do this but honestly it&#039;s probably more likely to be a disadvantage than an advantage. More than likely completely pointless however
