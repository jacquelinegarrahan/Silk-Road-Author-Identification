				No swallow&nbsp; is better.&nbsp; It could depend on things, like Ex pills I swallow because its not that much when you crush it, waste of money.<br />MDMA when I swallow in capsule form I get really fucked up.&nbsp; Now if your at a part or some shit snorting is kool, but you snort alot.

				snorting will make the onset quicker but i hear its a little bit of a waste and doesn&#039;t last as long. overall, you will probably have a better rolling experience if you just eat em

				MDMA pills are better taken orally in my opinion.<br /><br />With crushing pills you end up with a lot of inactive filler (necessary to press the pill) going up your nose.<br /><br />Also the duration of the effects is longer through the oral route.<br /><br /><br />

				thebaine<br /><br />Snorting a whole disco biscuit is no easy task there really ain&#039;t too many willing participants cause it tastes awful ...only do it for the novelty factor maybe try a third. <br /><br />molly is one of those drugs&nbsp; that seems to work best when swallowed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve swallowed cocaine before going in to a nightclub.... what a complete waste.<br /><br />Damn kamakazi parachutes

				No the pills are to large , theyll just plug up your nose.<br /><br />seriously the pill binders and crap will clog up your sinuses. very little will pass thru nasal membrane and youll be eating it anyways with a glob of chalky snot. <br />Advantages to snorting&nbsp; dope are pretty small actually, and potentially could harm your sinuses.

				Crystalline MDMA HCL is rough enough on the nose for me... I never got into snorting pharmies, but have snorted a roll or two in my day and they hurt like the dickens. Too much plastics, for binders and fillers, in any kind of pill to make snorting it not totally mess with your septum eventually. Also a good, professional pneumatic pill press can exert thousands of pounds of pressure per square inch squishing any molly into the tiniest size, so roll size can never be a good indicator or how much mdma is actually inside.
