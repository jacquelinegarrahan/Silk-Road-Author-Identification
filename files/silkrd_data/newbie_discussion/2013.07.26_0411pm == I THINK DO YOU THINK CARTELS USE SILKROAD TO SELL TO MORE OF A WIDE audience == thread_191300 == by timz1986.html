				I have considered this.&nbsp; Not so much cartels, but let&#039;s say somebody moves keys at a time.&nbsp; They usually buy like 20 Kilos or something and sells them for...umm...a lot.&nbsp; Now let&#039;s say next time they buy twenty-one kilos, sells the twenty just like normal and then takes the extra, dubs it out and makes a LOT of money.&nbsp; But people who are selling kilos probably don&#039;t want that kind of exposure.&nbsp; I admit, I really don&#039;t know how the cocaine market network works.

				It is very possible. I&#039;m sure some of the products sold on the road come from cartels, so technically yes they do in an indirect manner.

The Caps Lock button is right next to the &#039;A&#039; Button. But on topic, I think it would make sense, especially like the Mexican Cartels, if they&#039;re sending to America or the UK, these are two fairly wealthy countries, and in Mexico, they&#039;re powerful enough to not have to worry about being tracked and shut down, like domestic, small town growers/chemists would have to be concerned about. <br /><br />It reaches a wider audience, but at the same time, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s much more costly than selling directly to buyers, they&#039;re putting more trust in the buyers, they have to pay for shipping, and in situations like the Silk Road, they have to build a reputation among customers, something that I&#039;m sure they have no intention of doing, being such a large orginazation. <br /><br />When you&#039;re an individual seller, it&#039;s easier for you to contact customers, build a reputation, and be more personal, with the cartel, they would have to relegate someone to that position, a sales associate of sorts, and trust them to build a reputation with their customers.<br /><br />In short, I think no. I think markets like the Silk Road are too small, too risky, and too personal. Now, it&#039;s more likely that indivduals who have business with cartels most likely sell on SR, but I think cartels have enough business that they need not bother with the pocket change that would come from the SR, it could be a little profitable to set up a few guys to relegate the accounts on the side, but it wouldn&#039;t be as profitable as it would be to sell to individuals they work with personally.

				Well, ALL the cocaine in the world moves through cartel hands.&nbsp; Whether it&#039;s a mexican or Columbian drug lord selling the drugs on SilkRoad, or if it&#039;s a 22 year old white kid in Texas, it all comes from the the cartels.&nbsp; So yes, the cartels are selling drugs on Silk Road.

				IMO the cartels are involved in production and transportation not in the end sale/distribution of product.- Compared to the enormous volume that is daily produced and distributed is seems highly unlikely that any cartel or large organization would be involved, the profit margin are just not there- If you look at the facts its truely staggering- for example Pablo Escobar would right of 10% of his money annually in loss (due to water dmamge being eatne by rats etc.) and he was still one of the richest men in the world- that was decades ago and although i doubt that the cartels are well equipped to launder what is a cash business and no longer have huge warehouses out in the jungle stacked w/ US currency ( seriously im not making this up) I just dont see them selling what is small time transactions over the web<br />Another fun fact about Escobar he created a nice little zoo in Medellin and bought some&nbsp; Hippos who were left after he was killed then there were 4 now there are 40- in the jungles of Colombia

				The cartels probably sell to the vendors of SR, but not the customers themselves. I doubt they&#039;d waste the time and effort selling half grams and shit for $10-$30
