				Ok this might be a real beginner thing , but I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to email using thunderbird with gpg installed a SR user that has a&nbsp; @SR.onion domain email address, as it is &quot;returned un-routable&quot; I want to use Thunderbird as it will encrypt the message using the public key of the recipient. <br /><br />what am i missing here?

				Please make sure your Thunderbird is configured for a darknet email provider.&nbsp; You DO NOT want to be sending emails from your clearnet email provider.&nbsp; That is just as bad as sending email from gmail or yahoo to a vendor.

				You are forgiven.&nbsp; ;) and yes my thunderbird is configured using torbirdy but still wondering..<br /><br />Platform:mac <br />programs :thunderbird , GPG <br />trying to: send an email to someone on SR. The public key imports their email address as&nbsp; &quot;blahblah@SR.onion&quot; <br /><br />Is this the email address i send to? as it is returned UN-routable?<br /><br />So am I missing something? do i change the domain? how do i get the email address of th ...@sr.onion not real email addresses and do i have to use the messaging in SR? or is there a way for me to use my thunderbird (behind tor with gpg)

				I think I get it now.<br /><br />What your seeing in the vendors public key is a fictitious email, some use tor emails and some just make some up because the more information you type in when creating your key the more secure it is, well the block of text is bigger at least not sure how much more secure it is.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want to message a vendor on the road, send them a PM and if it has some sensitive information then encrypt it.&nbsp; Open a text file, type your message, use your gpg program to encrypt it then copy and paste the block of text into the PM to the vendor. <br /><br />If your using gpg tools have you ever used it before?

				Ahhh DoctorFate you nailed it. I was thinking that the email might just be a fake one entered. Ok so generally speaking to take the conversation &quot;offline&quot; (by this i mean off of SR messaging,&nbsp; and communicate between my tormail adresss on thunderbird) how would one do this? <br />In other words once i message through SR will most respond to my tormail address if i give it to them in the initial contact? (encrypted of course)<br /><br />I just started using GPG but I do get the gyst of it. I have the users public key and can encrypt the text and copy it over to the SR message. One additional thing. can i just include my public key in the encrypted message body text for them in the initial contact?<br /><br />thanks for the help!
