				A kind of spammy thread, but figured it would also offer a little insight into our drug usage from another perspective, here&#039;s one of my favorites thus far, a simple, classic one by Alan Watts:<br /><br />&quot;Psychedelic experience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight, but a glimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways of meditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen...&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s how I look at all drugs, it shows you where the window is and might crack it open a touch, but its your job to throw that window open and take a deep breathe of air.<br /><br />What&#039;s your favorite drug related quote?

				&quot;Everything we do is for the purpose of altering consciousness. We form friendships so that we can feel certain emotions, like love, and avoid others, like loneliness. We eat specific foods to enjoy their fleeting presence on our tongues. We read for the pleasure of thinking another person&#039;s thoughts. Every waking moment--and even in our dreams--we struggle to direct the flow of sensation, emotion, and cognition toward states of consciousness that we value. Drugs are another means towards this end.&quot; -Sam Harris<br /><br />&quot;Among the many mysteries and insults presented by DMT, it offers a final mockery of our drug laws: Not only have we criminalized naturally occurring substances, like cannabis; we have criminalized one of our own neurotransmitters.&quot; -Sam Harris<br /><br />I recommend reading more of Sam Harris&#039; work such as &quot;Drugs and the Meaning of Life&quot; and &quot;Free Will&quot;. Brilliant man.

				&quot;Jesus man! You don&#039;t look for acid! Acid finds you when *it * thinks you&#039;re ready.&quot; - Hunter S. Thompson<br /><br />It&#039;s very true whenever I am looking for acid, everywhere is completely dry. But when I stop looking for acid it always comes my way. Of cause, with me recently discovering silk road there&#039;s no more need to call friends to get directed to friend of friends to then finally getting some tabs and them turning out to be absolute shit.
