				Hey all you fellow stoners out there who have received some dank bud and wanna leave a review on the regular cannabis review page but can&#039;t because ya don&#039;t have 50 fuckin posts feel free to post your reviews of your favorite vendors here!<br /><br />I&#039;ll start it off with a few of my favorites:<br />Note that many of these reviews talk in the present but most were origininally posted day/weeks ago.<br /><br />*******Brutusk Review:********<br /><br />Order came in yesterday and I&#039;m just getting on the forums now, sorry for the delay! The Purple Romulan and Mendocino Purp shipped Saturday and arrived Thursday cross country over New Years so AWESOME fast shipping!&nbsp; Stealth was as expected with multiple vacuum sealed layers and color barrier as expected from brutusk who always employs top notch shipping methods. <br /><br />Purple Romulan:&nbsp; Huge (&gt;5g)&nbsp; to medium dark green fluffy nugs with a good amount of purple color as brutusk described.&nbsp; Most of the tips of the buds were so nice and dark purple. The buds had a nice floral smell with a hint of berries when broken up.&nbsp; The high creeps up on you, I wasn&#039;t quite sure of the potency until my fifth bong rip when I realized I was baked as fuck.&nbsp; Thanks Brut!<br /><br />Mendocino Purple&nbsp; medium (1g- 3g) nugs with a great pungent piney smell that fills up the room every time the lid comes off the mason jar.. and that&#039;s pretty often haha.&nbsp; The buds are nice and dense and light green with bright orange hairs and crystals.&nbsp; The high from this bud hits ya quick with a nice sativa buzz that you can ride all day long!<br /><br />Jack Herrer Review:&nbsp; I received my order of jack professionally packaged as always with multiple vacuum sealed layers with a color barrier in between.&nbsp; Product was several layers deep within the stealth package, Brutusk knows what he&#039;s doing and takes the extra step when shipping bud!<br /><br />The buds themselves were overall medium in size with a few nice large (&gt;4g) nugs.&nbsp; They are light green in color with so many orange hairs and trichomes covering them I couldn&#039;t wait to break them up!&nbsp; Them smell once broken up is heavenly; initially the aroma was dank and of citrous and it becomes extremely fruity and&nbsp; sweet once ground up!&nbsp; Brutusk hooked me up with 10+ grams extra on top of the hp to make my day that much better!&nbsp; The high hits real quick with the jack and is nice and energetic and mentally stimulating as promised as a sativa!<br /><br />Great buds as always Brutusk, coming soon: more JH reviews and review on Bubba Purple<br /><br /><br />**********NoStess Review:***********<br /><br />The delivery took a couple extra days compared to other orders shipped the same day but who knows with the mail system.. Anyway they package came perfectly intact and there was decent stealth with one layer of vacuum seal inside a color barrier.&nbsp; I think more precaution would have been taken if it was a larger order.&nbsp; NS communicated well with me and made sure our transaction went smoothly!<br /><br />Vanilla Kush:<br /><br />Appearance:&nbsp; medium sized light green nugs with lots of trichomes covering them making the buds look off-white/yellowish because of all the crystals! In between the leaves you can see some nice orange hairs; these buds were very nicely trimmed with virtually no leaf or stem. <br /><br />Smell/taste:&nbsp; This bud smells so dank and sour it immediately reminded me exactly of sour skittles, especially when ground up! MMM the smoke tastes amazing on the exhale with floral notes that actually remind you of vanilla or at least a nice sweetness. <br /><br />High:&nbsp; Well.. I’ve already been high all morning but from the looks, smell, and smoke of this bud combined with how I’m feeling that Vanilla kush produces an awesome high. <br /><br />Mid-Grade Chronic:<br /><br />Appearance:&nbsp; small nugs with some shake but appears to have a lot of crystal and orange color to the buds.&nbsp; Although there was some shake it was all from popcorn buds no leaf.&nbsp; I would be happy to buy zips of this bud for a good price based on appearance. <br /><br />Smell/taste:&nbsp; Smells surprisingly fruity and dank for being advertised as mid grade.&nbsp; I smelled aromas of fruitiness and cherries when I opened the bag.&nbsp; When ground up it gained an even more sour and skunky smell and smokes real sweet with a peppery kick! I like this chronic so far!<br /><br />High:&nbsp; Again, I’ve smoked so much today already it’s pretty hard to differentiate the highs, but I would definitely recommend both the Vanilla Kush and Chronic to buyers depending on the money they are looking to spend. <br /><br /><br />********FastForward Review:*********<br /><br />Hey everybody, I placed my first order with FF last week to try a couple strains of his dank.&nbsp; The order was shipped within an hour (Crazy fast!!) and I was notified via pm as soon as it was dropped at the post office.&nbsp; FF has great communication, quick stealth shipping and stellar nugs.<br /><br />Blue Dream -<br />smell -&nbsp; Instantly filled the room with an amazing blueberry skunky aroma, when broken apart the buds were absolutely filled in crystals and smelled so sweet.<br />color -&nbsp; &nbsp;The outside of the buds were dark dreen and crystally with orange hairs all over.<br />trim - dense buds with no leaves<br />Overall - This BD smokes so smooth and has the classic berry earthy taste on the exhale and gets you super stones with just a few rips.&nbsp; A++<br /><br />Green Crack : **This is one of the best strains I have ever smoked<br />color - bright orange and green with ridiculous amounts of crystals throughout.&nbsp; Gotta be careful with these buds, just holding one will cover your hands in kief!<br />smell - dank citrusy perfection<br />trim - some of the densest nugs I&#039;ve ever seen with no fluffy leaf whatsoever<br />Overall - Astonishing quality with strong but pleasant smoke that will give you one of the best mental and active highs you&#039;ve had in a long time.&nbsp; A+++<br /><br />Cherrie Pie and SSH:&nbsp; Received my gram of Cherrie pie and SSH today in its ridiculously good stealth package and was ecstatic to find FF hooked me up with almost .6 extra!&nbsp; The nugs came in three or four small nuggs and one big (around .8g) nug that were completely orange and purple.&nbsp; They felt very dense and sticky inside and smelled amazingly dank! As always FF went above and beyond in every catagory and is a great vendor!!<br /><br />*********NorthWestDirect Review:*********<br /><br />NWD Hooked me up with four samples that were packaged individually heat sealed and vacuum sealed with layers of color barriers.&nbsp; The packaged arrived promptly in three days across the country and I couldn’t be happier!&nbsp; Here is a review of the strains I received:<br /><br />Jack Herrer: nice dark green bud with small dark green leaves and orange hairs.&nbsp; You can see the trichomes glistening when held up to the light and smell skunky and like quality outdoor buds.&nbsp; You can tell that the JH was properly cured with a “crisp” feel to it when breaking it up and after using a grinder it smells nice and citrusy.&nbsp; Smoke was smooth and sweet and gave a good cerebral uplifting high.<br /><br />BlackBerry Kush: Immediately smelled so sour and like fresh berries when I opened the bag I was pleasantly surprised!&nbsp; The nug was nicely covered in orange hairs and had TONS of trichomes that made it look like the bud was covered in crystals.&nbsp; After ground up it was amazingly pungent and sour they should make air fresheners out of this smell!! The smoke was simply amazing, smooth and berry-y!<br /><br />Shish:&nbsp; Sweet and mucky smell that lets you know its top quality bud.&nbsp; The nug of this strain was denser and again filled with crystals; my fingers got sticky breaking it apart.&nbsp; The smoke was a bit harsher than the first two strains but I think this could be because of a higher thc content! Overall great bud.<br /><br />Blue Cheese:&nbsp; They call it blue cheese for a reason it actually has that super dank cheesy smell that fills the room.&nbsp; The smell was even stronger once ground and the smoke weirdly tastes just like blue cheese.. and gets you high as fuck!!<br /><br />13<br />Rumor mill / Re: NoStress review thread<br />« on: January 14, 2013, 07:14 pm »<br />Hey Everyone Here&#039;s my review of NoStress&#039;s Vanilla Kush and Chronic!<br /><br />The delivery took a couple extra days compared to other orders shipped the same day but who knows with the mail system.. Anyway they package came perfectly intact and there was decent stealth with one layer of vacuum seal inside a color barrier.&nbsp; I think more precaution would have been taken if it was a larger order.&nbsp; NS communicated well with me and made sure our transaction went smoothly!<br /><br />Vanilla Kush: <br /><br />Appearance:&nbsp; medium sized light green nugs with lots of trichomes covering them making the buds look off-white/yellowish because of all the crystals!

				my first two orders:<br /><br />a g of green crack from MarleysMainMan, which was pretty danky, although it wasnt better than the medical I can get locally, so I wont be buying from him again becasue I am only looking for top top notch dank here.<br /><br />a g of grape ape from GoodTimes. wasnt anything close to medical dank at all. Too dry, no purp to it, and It had seeds, (which I&#039;m saving to germinate)<br /><br />both were great vendors as far as shipping packaging and price but the quality just wasn&#039;t up to my standards.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Agreed! Building good relationships with your favorite vendors is key to succeeding here on the road.&nbsp; Once you have some history with a vendor selling a product that you like you should stick with them to reduce the chances of getting scammed to virtually none!&nbsp; And show your vendors some love and make sure to become a fan or give them a good report if they deserve recognition for exemplary work.&nbsp;

				I recently ordered form Carlos Lopez and he proved himself to be an outstanding vendor! he has completely earned my respect. <br /><br />product is outstanding got the early skunk which smells so nice and fruity.

				Vendor NorCalChronic Review:&nbsp; HIGHly Recommended A+++<br /><br />WOW NorCalChronic Everything about our transaction was perfect!.. except on my part for not writing this review sooner.&nbsp; I sincerely apologize because this review is long overdue due to me being extremely overloaded and just trying to pass my last semester of senior year of school... priorities had to be passing my classes but I&#039;ll follow through on out deal now; I can&#039;t wait any longer to tell everybody how great the buds from NCC really are!<br /><br />I ordered a sample pack that NorCal put together to me custom at my request.&nbsp; It consisted of Bubba Kush, Bobba Con (Bubba Kush X LA Confidential), and Purple Bubble Berry!<br /><br />Communication: NorCalChronic communicated professionally and friendly with me as I asked him questions about his different strains and methods of growing, shipping etc.. he answered with enthusiasm and made my experience as a buyer a great and comfortable one!&nbsp; At no moment did I ever feel worried about my order&#039;s safety or the quality of the bud, NCC is a trustworthy vendor!<br /><br />Shipping:&nbsp; The shipping time was extremely quick traveling thousands of miles to me in less than 3 days!&nbsp; The packaging was adequately stealthly packed with all the precautions that I look for when opening it, and best of all the innermost layer contained small pockets of air to protect the buds from being crushed and unappealing to the eye.&nbsp; These buds were in PRISTINE condition!!<br /><br />Bud Appearance/quantity:&nbsp; All bags were nicely a few points over in weight on top of an already generous offer from NCC.<br /><br />Bubba Kush - This Bubba Kush looked like a Bubba Kush pictured in a cannabis magazine; they were all about .7g and ONLY buds.&nbsp; I repeat no leaf, no stem, ONLY buds that were light green in color and absolutely covered in white crystals giving them a frosty appearance.&nbsp; This was some perfectly cured and grown bud that you can tell was handled with care.&nbsp; It was the perfect density that appeared to by fluffy to the eye but was dense with crystals that gave it a simultaneously sticky/crispy feeling when broken apart with the fingers!<br /><br />Bubba Con -&nbsp; The Bubba Con had one big (1.5-2g) nug and many nice nugs weighing around half a gram each.&nbsp; This strain appeared slightly darker green than the Bubba Kush and slightly less covered in crystals.&nbsp; Although it may have had a few less trichomes on the outside you discover the inside to be a goldmine of THC trichome stickiness!<br /><br />Purple Bubble Berry - Holy Cow! Nicely done NCC the pbb buds are all uniform .5-.8g nugs that are all bud thats over 40% true purple color that varies from light to dark on each bud.&nbsp; The purple color along with to the fact that it&#039;s covered in trichomes as much, if not more than the Bubba Kush make this my pick for Favorite Bag Appeal. <br /><br />Bud Smell/taste:<br />Bubba Kush - Smelled super dank like a good classic kush should.&nbsp; As soon as the nth layer of vacuum seal was sliced open revealing the buds the entire room was engulfed in this heavenly aroma.&nbsp; I consider myself a cannabis aficionado and I know that smell isn&#039;t the only indicator of potency but let me tell you I love it when my bud REEKS with dankness and all three of these strains passed the smell test with flying colors!&nbsp; The dankness on the Bubba Kush definitely had a nice strong citrousy sour smell as well which I loved.<br /><br />Bubba Con - Wow what can I say after the last review which pretty much covered all of the strains in terms of strength of smell.&nbsp; The Bubba Con differed from the Kush with a more peppery herby smell on top of that strong dank undertone. <br /><br />Purple Bubble Berry - In addition to the strong dankness this strain was my favorite to smell.&nbsp; Just listen to the name and imagine the best possible smell for it!&nbsp; Super fruity sourness accompanies a very pleasant earthiness that&#039;s perfect for this strain!<br /><br />All Strains tasted great and gave great highs equal to some of the best top shelf cannabis I&#039;ve had the privilege to try!

				This has peaked my interest. NCC is next on the list... currently working on a thorough vendor sampling for tasty products--and reviews to come. Unfortunately I have no images to post, only words, so the more confusing a review gets, then assume it was excellent gear.

I&#039;m located in The US and offer high grade, real medical marijuana with THC levels ranging from 19-22% which is grown indoors, hydroponically. I have magic shrooms from a local farmer which are grown indoors as well. I offer top notch, pure, clean Ecstasy which is imported from Europe and its bomb! I will soon have high grade, washed Cocaine and MDMA to sell within the next week to come. I&#039;ve been in business for 7+ years and although there is still much to learn but, I do my best to offer honest, fast, reliable service.

Their product got me too fucked up to remember their name. ;) Overweight, great customer service. Great gear!<br /><br />NorthWestDirect. Fantastic product. Medical grade, indeed. Very therapeutic, very tasty, well cured.<br /><br />Cannabis Arbiter isn&#039;t bad, but last I used them (several months ago), their stealth wasn&#039;t as good as it could be... but things could be different now. (Recent Customers: please confirm/deny for a fair review) I really enjoy the variety that CA offers.<br /><br />UndergroundSyndicate. Good product, fair price. Not good for resale, but for personal use, then it is not bad at all. Stealth was good--not the best, but it was a &quot;sample-sized&quot; quantity, and overall reasonable stealth.

				FarmGuy. I got a QP. 4 different strains. Grade A vendor<br /><br />Chernobyl - Sativa Dom. Could have cured a little longer in my opinion, but a nice body high leaving my mind clear.<br />Sage Kush - 70/30 Sativa dom, great wake and bake. Mild pain relief with a good body high.<br />Master Kush - 70/30 Indiva dom, Great for eating and bedtime.<br />Purp Diesel - 60/40 Indica dom, good mellow high for just relaxing.<br /><br />It was half an O over. Great communication, fast shipping.<br /><br />MarleysMainMan - 2Gs (Each weighed 1.3 so got 2.6) Great communication, fast shipping. Grade A vendor.<br /><br />Amnesia Haze - Sativa, very nice fruity taste, great high for throughout the day.<br />Black Widow - My favorite of all the strains I have had. Sativa, very unique taste to me, but I am a Sativa fan and I loved this high. <br /><br />Drwhite - QP of Commercial<br />Nothing against the vendor. Great communication, fast shipping, everything he said it was... But I lost on this deal... Again, nothing against the vendor. I was impatient and tried to rush something... I made a mistake.<br /><br />The Top Shelf - Scammer.<br /><br />Thanks for your time. <br /><br />

				OGbryan - ordered a half O of OG Banana Kush. Arrived quickly, good enough stealth. It thought the bud was OK, not what he was bragging about in his profile. I&#039;ve heard that sometimes when he runs out, he will have another grower&#039;s bud instead. Whatever, it was still AWESOME pot, just didn&#039;t seem like &quot;the best on the west coast, 10 years perfected strains.&quot;<br /><br />MIMM - got a quarter of Hindu Kush and an eighth of Romulan. I have to say, if you have not tried some romulan, do yourself a favor and find some. This was a great strain, knocked me on my ass, very strong body high. The hindu kush was great as well. Stealth was as good as it gets. No complaints.<br /><br />Blue Skies Red Eyes - Fucking fabulous MJ, true medical grade. The Blue Dream was some of the best I have ever smoked. Stealth was very good, and shipping only took 2 days.<br /><br />Angel Eyes - 2+ month cure grape Bogglegum and 4+ month cure grape Bogglegum. 2 month arrived quickly, ordered for a friend so I have not tried this one yet, but judging by others (and his) reviews, its going to be a treat. Stealth was reported as very good and creative. The 4 month BOG should be here soon, can&#039;t wait to try this one.<br /><br />
