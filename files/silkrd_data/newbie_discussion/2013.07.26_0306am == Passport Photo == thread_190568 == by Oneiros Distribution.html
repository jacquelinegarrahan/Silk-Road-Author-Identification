				Title: <strong>Passport Photo</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>Oneiros Distribution</strong> on <strong>July 26, 2013, 03:06 am</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Couldn&#039;t find any thread about this by searching so thought I&#039;d make one. Now obviously a Passport Photo is needed for a forged ID of any kind but the crux is the majority of buyers on Silk Road use their own photo for buying Novelty IDs to get some booze or Driving Licenses to possibly get away from fines - they want it to resemble themselves as much as possible. I&#039;m looking for the exact opposite to that, photos from anywhere that look as different as possible from me.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />To begin with I did a response to a thread called Fake I.D.&#039;s, Passports, and Disguises: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184022.msg1335061#msg1335061<br />It lists all current Forgery Vendors who provide IDs of various kinds. Now most of them don&#039;t provide actual Forged Passports but since the concept of a Passport Quality Photo applies for all kinds of IDs I&#039;ll include all of the vendors in this thread and if they have any explanations on their profile and/or listings in regards to how the photo should look like:<br /><br />Vendor A: TedDanzigSR - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b2e1b93742<br />Explanation: Yes - has a somewhat comprehensive section over at their companion website: http://efhhaozlsgglfx2m.onion/started.html<br /><br />Vendor B: KingOfClubs - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/eaee669cc1<br />Explanation: Yes - has a section on their profile:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: KingOfClubs</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-Take 1 photo taken with a digital camera against a wall, from the shoulders up. (The better the pic the better the ID, you can also get passport photos done and scan them, up to you. Make sure you send pics with the size at least 1.5 megabytes and up.)<br />**Try to avoid having shadows in the pictures, if there is a shadow I will do my best to edit accordingly**</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Vendor C: namedeclined - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d55ca24e41<br />Explanation: Yes, explanation in listings:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: namedeclined</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">*Please take a ID quality photo in a well lit area. Ideally have someone else take the photo and do not use a cell phone.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Vendor D: perfectscans - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/fcc0da37e0<br />Explanation: Yes, explanation in listings:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: perfectscans</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Passport Quality Pic.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Vendor E: supremePSY - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7630e2bcca<br />Explanation: No - only seems to have a guide listing for how to create novelty IDs.<br /><br />Vendor F: YourCannabisProvider - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/bc04279465<br />Explanation: No - no Active Listings currently.<br /><br />Vendor G: his royal highness: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/80811f8926<br />Explanation: No - Vacation Mode.<br /><br />Vendor H: Red Bull - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5ca833dace<br />Explanation: Yes - explanation in listings:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Red Bull</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">- a biometric photograph</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Vendor I: Fear The Reaper - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ae959dae64<br />Explanation: No - forgeries listed don&#039;t require photos.<br /><br />Vendor J: starlight - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7399ffa5d5<br />Explanation: Yes, explanation in listings:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: starlight</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Headshot (optional)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Vendor K: NoQuarter - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9148bc20d9<br />Explanation: No - however from the listings it appears a random ID photo &quot;might&quot; be provided.<br /><br />Vendor L: Rainbowbrite123 - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/80ac6ef804<br />Explanation: No - only sells an actual Passport with a fixed picture.<br /><br />As one can see with the exception of TedDanzigSR the explanations are very simple and basically just amount to &quot;take a Passport Photo&quot;. Now personally I wasn&#039;t familiar with Passport Photos at all before this thread and I&#039;m sure there are many like me, so these explanations didn&#039;t help much at all. Below I&#039;ll list all links with information listing what constitutes a &quot;Passport Photo&quot; from official sources from I&#039;ve been able to find:<br />----------<br />Australia: https://www.passports.gov.au/Web/Requirements/Photos.aspx<br />Austria: http://www.passbildkriterien.at/oesterreich_neu.html ( Native Language )<br />Canada: http://www.passport.gc.ca/info/photos.aspx<br />Denmark: https://www.borger.dk/Sider/Regler-om-pas.aspx ( Native Language )<br />Finland: http://www.police.fi/poliisi/home.nsf/pages/AAF8DA6C2A3D663AC22570910026CA45<br />Germany: http://www.germany.info/contentblob/1954900/Daten/124004/Pass_Passbild_Schablone.pdf ( Native Language ) / http://www.germany.info/contentblob/2177362/Daten/178573/Sample_Photos_DD.pdf<br />India: http://passport.gov.in/cpv/column_guidelines.htm ( Not sure if this is a joke or not&nbsp; :o )<br />Netherlands: http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/photo-matrix-guidelines.pdf<br />Norway: http://www.udi.no/Norwegian-Directorate-of-Immigration/Oversiktsider/Common-pages/Photo-requirements/<br />United Kingdom: https://www.gov.uk/photos-for-passports<br />United States: http://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotoreq/digitalimagereq/digitalimagereq_5306.html<br />----------<br />During my search I randomly stumbled upon companies who specialize in transforming pictures online to Passport Photo Standards, their argument being why go to a photo booth when it can be done by them. This is the perfect type of company to use for finding a decent picture online and then being able to remake them so they can be used for a forged Passport. A selection of ten companies I could find which provide this service:<br /><br />http://www.123passportphoto.com/<br />http://www.epassportphoto.com/<br />http://www.idphoto4you.com/<br />http://www.kodakexpresscamden.com/Passports-Online-Ordering.html<br />http://www.makepassportphoto.com/<br />http://www.onlinepassportphoto.com/<br />http://www.passportphotonow.com/<br />http://www.passportphotostudio.com/win/index.html<br />http://www.pic4pass.com/<br />http://www.yourpassportphoto.co.uk/

				Why would you want a fake id that doesn&#039;t look like you it will not work as an id for you?

Ideally it would be combined with a VPN from the same country as the service offering - have a thread up for that as well called VPN Services That Take Your Anonymity Seriously, 2013 Edition: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177551 :)

				Hi,<br /><br />Had an idea on this, as a service or listing and wondered what you thought.<br /><br />Would be worth us offering a listing to do exactly that ? as long as the pic confirms to the requirements of whatever country, i.e. US passport do not mind you smiling, UK passports, NO smiles allowed, we can create a listing to make your PIC passport quality.<br /><br />This is something I have considered to help both customers and myself.<br /><br />

However there&#039;s also the second part of even if one has access to a Virtual Identity not many see any use for it and I think this is mainly due to the fact people don&#039;t realize when signing up for a service which requires a Passport Verification the people taking the copy have no actual way of verifying it&#039;s fake unless they see it right away OR they call the Passport Origin Country and verify the ID directly with the Law Enforcement Agency in that country - very few take the time do this and even if they did assuming a decent VPN has been used there&#039;s virtually no risk involved if a Virtual Identity gets busted. With that said there are some companies who do take it to the next level like Coinbase which requires questions to be answered based on a persons Social Security Number, Forgeries unfortunately won&#039;t help much here.<br /><br />I would suggest the following information is supplied with each photo:<br /><br />Gender: Male or Female, N/A if unknown.<br />Age: Approximate Age, N/A if unknown.<br />Ethnicity: A guess on what area of the world the person originates from, N/A if unknown.<br />Original: The original photo is supplied along with a country of choice by using the &quot;Postage&quot; option so an edited photo for that country is included.<br /><br />In addition I would recommend the following:<br /><br />Variation: The photo should preferably have some kind of minor editing each time a new customer gets it, although obviously magic can&#039;t be made and the person won&#039;t look like another person they shouldn&#039;t be able to check that two photos are technically absolutely the same.<br />Preference: The buyer gets to pick through for example postage what preference they have in terms of Gender, Ethnicity will kind of be automatic if one gets to pick country of choice - if nothing is picked they get an entirely random photo instead.

				I will create a passport pic listing at some point.<br /><br />I am wary of using the same pic even with variations, I am very aware that many of my documents get used at the same places hence I work hard on variation. Ideally, I want to create a database of pics but have exhausted all of my contacts, hackers and the like on getting this together.<br /><br />our focus at the moment will be on new documents, and new account services, and we are working hard towards more anon banking too.
