				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I have been pretty active purchasing over the last 2 months with (previously) perfect stats:<br />Total transactions: 32<br />Total spent: $6197.21<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 3 months<br /><br />Now, I made a couple of purchases from a vendor that I had a past issue with. I never received the package. He did a partial re-shipment. I ordered a couple of more things recently (he was the only domestic seller), and this time I paid for Express shipping for each (not so much for delivery speed, but for the tracking). I received 1 order, that was standard delivery, though I still was charged the Express Rate. Is this OK? I sent a message to him about it and never received a response.<br /><br />The second order from him I also paid for Express shipping (for a $30 purchase), again with the Express option. I waited, and waited, as his profile says delivery might take a while. I was so patient that now both of these orders have been auto-finalized! I messaged him again, still waiting for a response. I have not filled in my feedback yet.<br /><br />Do I have any recourse through the resolution center if the orders have been auto-finalized? Now my stats have a 7.55% auto-finalize rate (obviously that calculation is not based on bitcoins spent, but # of transactions).<br /><br />If i don&#039;t hear back from him in day or so, can I still raise the issues in the Resolution Center? How would I do that? I don&#039;t really care about the piddly amount of money, but just that it has been a big hassle, and I have not received my second package, and the harm done to my purchasing stats.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t left feedback yet -- I feel like giving him a &quot;1&quot; with why I am giving him that rating. However, I am afraid he will add me to the secret vendor &quot;black list&quot; if I do so.<br /><br />Any suggestions?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Frog<br />

				you should have went to resolution and extended it before it auto finalized!! i believe once it auto finalizes that&#039;s it. its final. <br /><br />you can, and SHOULD leave a 1/5 and leave a warning that he may be a possible scammer. USA domestic, shipped express, does NOT take so long that your order should auto finalize. i have never, ever, ever, had something come express and it take over 2 days.
