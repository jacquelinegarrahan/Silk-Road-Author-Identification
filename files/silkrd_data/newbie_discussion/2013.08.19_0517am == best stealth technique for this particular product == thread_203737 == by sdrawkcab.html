				So, say someone had 30 suboxone strips they are going to mail to someone, how would you stealth it up?<br /><br />What size/type letter to use<br />what to conceal the 30 strips with<br />basically, how would someone make it as stealth as possible? <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m just so curious...

				i have been, i read the shipping guide thing that is the very first post and what i got from that is to maybe put them in a 9x5 envelope (does it matter if its manilla envelope or will white work?) and is that the right size? also, i read about people putting things in cd cases, are they referring to dvd cases or music cd cases?

				Do not expect a very definitive answer.<br />There is some great info on this forum tho!<br />But do be creative when finding your own answer. You got this!<br /><br />Good luck

				ok, ive got a pretty good idea of what someone would do but i do have a couple questions,<br /><br />would an x-ray be able to see through the envelope and see the suboxone strips/wrappers<br /><br />and i dont think so, but would a dog be able to smell the suboxone?<br /><br />thank you guys<br /><br /><br /><br />p.s. if it&#039;s not against the rules, anyone with a good idea could PM me their idea of how to mail 30 suboxone strips..

				Envelopes don&#039;t usually get x-rayed from what I have heard. Just try to make it look like something innocent and normal.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if dogs smell suboxone but I think they are usually only trained to smell certain things (e.g. the obvious cocaine, heroine, meth, I don&#039;t know).

				So say someone was to line suboxone strips up (in their foil wrappers) in-between pages of a thin book, and put it in a 9x5 envelope, with a proper printed label with a random return business address from the area it&#039;s being sent and also print the label with address and name of whom the suboxone was being sent to, also make the package look neat....<br /><br />Would that work
