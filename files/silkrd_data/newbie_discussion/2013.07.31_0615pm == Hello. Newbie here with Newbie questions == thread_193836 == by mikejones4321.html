				Hello all. I would like to place an order (or two) but I have some security questions and can&#039;t seem to find them flipping through the threads. I&#039;m sure this has been asked a hundred times. If this information is some sort of security-secret too, then I understand so please ignore anything inappropriate.<br /><br />My concern of course is delivery. How do you pick a delivery address? Surely you don&#039;t want to have a delivery at your home. Ideally, an anonymous PO Box would be best but I&#039;m not sure if there is a way to get one anonymously. So what is good and safe practice for delivery? <br /><br />Thanks

				I think packages going to PO boxes tend to be more inspected by customs. Most of the people send to their home and put a fake name if it&#039;s possible.

				I think most people use their own address from what I&#039;ve read on the forums. You can use PO boxes, you&#039;ll need some fake ID if want to use them anonymously, though that could potentially get you in more trouble if shit did hit the fan.

				The general rule of thumb is real address real name..<br />(That&#039;s what I&#039;ve read via these forums)<br />I think the rule of plausible denial protects the recipient.&nbsp; (As long as you aren&#039;t getting bricks shipped to you)

				Cool. Thanks for the replies. Have there been instances where buyers are messed with? I read somewhere that there has only been one instance of a seller being messed with, but from my understanding buyers are pretty safe. Please let me know if I&#039;m wrong on that.<br /><br />And FYI, no, no bricks lol. I just want some shrooms for personal use. It&#039;s been way too long and I&#039;m way too out of touch with my spiritual self. Unfortunately we don&#039;t get enough rain or ideal conditions for them to grow here. We&#039;ll probably wind up growing them at one point or another but we really need to sit down, eat some and go into the other realm for a bit :D. I don&#039;t even do anything too much anymore. I use to have all the connections in the world for whatever I needed but that was years ago. Now-a-days, it&#039;s all for spiritual use. Fucking shame that we have to hide in the shadows and worry about LE when simply trying to practice shamanism, self healing and self improvement. We should be able to just go to the store and buy them. But don&#039;t even get me started on the war on drugs because it will turn into a novel.

				Some mates and me have received dozens of packages and never got a problem, as Itakethem2study if customs get the package you can pretend it&#039;s not yours.

				Yeah I think with personal use - as long as good judgement is used you should be fine.<br />I order parts from all over the internet.. some of the stuff i get is shipped so poorly, it looks like it could be contraband.<br /><br />I love mushrooms too :)<br />
