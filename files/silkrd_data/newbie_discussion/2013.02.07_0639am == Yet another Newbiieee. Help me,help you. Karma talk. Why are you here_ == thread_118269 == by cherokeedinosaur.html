				I&#039;m trying to score some MDMA for my girlfriend and I&#039;s 4 yr anniversary! Just scored Bassnectar tickets and needed the perfect thing to pair with it. She&#039;s been dying to try MDMA and so have I. I&#039;ve just learned PGP and made my tormail. Browing.&nbsp; about on Silk Road and reading through some guides on reddit (some of that shit is so conflicting). I&#039;m still trying to figure out how to do the whole bitcoin thing, it&#039;s 1am here and my brain is kinda mush after 22 hours of no sleep (insomnia rocks,not!). So yeah,any tips on making things easier? Also, have any of you had success on the road yet?

				There is several ways to get Bitcoins, depending on where you live. Here&#039;s a wiki site on the topic. (Clearweb)<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins

				I first came here to by drugs, but since the first moment of realization, what SR really is - made me think. Now i am here to help contributing, for those who want to see, either through knowledge, good advice or simply biocircuit feedback ;)<br /><br />For the BTC&#039;s i used a combination of virwox, blockchain and instawallet ;)<br /><br />Cheers!

				I&#039;ll tell you the best way to get bitcoins.It is to walk into wallmart and go to the Money gram section or any other Money gram store and askfor the blue form. fill it up using any fake name, as they usually don&#039;t ask for an ID.&nbsp; Hand over the money and write in the bitcoin address and get your bitcoins deposited in 3 minutes.

				1. make a new wallet with blockchain.info <br />2. once made, click on &quot;send cash&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;fund&quot; something like that<br />3. enter the amount of money you want to turn into bitcoins, fill out you REAL info with your REAL NAME<br />4. chose a location (i chose walmart the first time, but it didnt work so i chose a local pharmacy)<br />5. go to that location with cash and pay<br />6. go home and open up your wallet and your cash will be in blockchain.info<br />7. log on to sr and get your id key number and enter it in blockchain and transfer it. <br />Within a few hrs youll have your bitcoins in sr.

				Get a bitcoin wallet (online or desktop). It will take some time to synchronize to the BTC network at first. (Maybe a day or two..) It&#039;s a public record of every block created, (200k or something?)<br />You get an address. <br /><br />Then go to a site such as Blue Sky Traders and put in a cash bid for BTC. Contact them, and provide the address (like and acct #) that you would like your BTC deposited into. Deposit the $$ into the account that is e-mailed to you the day of trading. You will then receive BTC. <br /><br />Then, send BTC to the address provided on your SR &quot;account&quot; page. After it has been verified by the network- then you will see a balance in your SR account. Then, use like any other online store. <br /><br />from one newbie to another.. I hope this helps! <br /><br />PS- if you can figure out PGP encryption, BTC should be a piece of cake.

				Eh, been around the Silkroad for over 2 years now, but didn&#039;t really order often and simply haven&#039;t had the time to join the forums before. But I&#039;m getting a bit wary of just trusting feedback on Silkroad itself, soo....

				IM DEFINITELY NOT HERE TO DO ANYTHING THE POLICE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. <br /><br />I remember buying fake ID&#039;s and stuff off the internet back in 199X before cops knew about internet explorer. It was glory days until they started closing websites and whatnot. <br /><br />I figure the glory days are back.
