				Hello i ordered 2 grams of coke (dispaters) on saturday and it arrived on tuesday! Very fast and well packaged. Bang on weight and vac sealed. This is far better than street coke, i just had about a 50mg line (pretty small) and it was amazing for the price. Very nice and strong smelling and for the price it is good quality. It&#039;s not fishscale or anything but the price reflects that, it is 100% worth the money . I would love to buy again a fantastic seller with great communication! If you are on a budget and you want decent coke this is the guy to go to! 10/10!

				Insanely fast delivery so comms weren&#039;t required. The coke was good and definitely better than what I can get on the street. Early finalisation was annoying.<br /><br />Edit/update: Have now also had some of the next batch and have to say this wasn&#039;t quite as good. Was more mushy/crumbly which made me think it&#039;s probably been cut less but had to bump more often and my tolerance isn&#039;t that high.<br /><br />I recommend dispater for value relative to the rest of SR and lightning fast delivery. He doesn&#039;t bullshit about his coke, and you shouldn&#039;t expect top of the line.

				<br />Opiumtea, I have tried his Crack, it is OK , I had a sample &amp; then half a G as it was hard to tell from the sample. It is not the strongest I have had but it does the job.

				I ordered 1 gram from dispater last weekend (friday to be exact) for a family party that would have been unbearable sobre. Comms were fast and my order was processed within an hour and posted. Package came on time the next day (saturday), was well hidden and just overweight (1.1g according to my scales). Product was everything you could expect....and was very nearly as strong as other, more expensive &#039;fishscale&#039; offerings....for a much lower price. Overall, awesome customer service, very friendly and very good price/product also, nice one!

				Hi All - just wanted to review Dispaters coke<br /><br />I have been buying from Dispater for 5 weeks now on recommendation from a friend. I have bought 15g now since I first started cause I just can&#039;t get enough!! I was dubious about the cost to start with but was assured that I should FE early as requested and that I wont be disappointed. My first order arrived within 24 hours in what can only be described as the best stealth packaging I&#039;ve ever seen. You wouldn&#039;t be able to tell it apart from normal post and the way it is done means that any accidental &#039;tears&#039; in the postal processing wouldn&#039;t give away what it is either!!<br /><br />As for the product, my first line was a cautious one (just over 0.1) but crushed and chopped as fine as icing sugar and went up very well. The high was smooth and enjoyable and (as a person who gets verbal diarrheoa when using good white) I couldn&#039;t shut up! This lasted for a good hour before I was craving another bump to keep me going! 1/2g lasted me a whole night (about 6 hours) easily and the comedown was manageable easily provided you take the necessary precautions to look after yourself!!<br /><br />In conclusion, Dispater has got to be the best value for money seller with the best quality product.<br /><br />Give them a go!!

				I&#039;m very fond of coke. Typically I have it at least once a week (much more on holidays etc) and have been doing so for about 10 years.<br /><br />I&#039;m not an expert on testing purity but experience with other stimulants has taught me to recognise active cuts in coke.&nbsp; In my life I&#039;ve had the very best coke available (Peru) as well as the shittest (Soho yardies).<br /><br />Since discovering Silk Road, I&#039;ve bought from most UK coke vendors here but the one vendor I most regularly buy from is Dispater and he has never once let me down.<br /><br />I&#039;ll break this review down a bit for clarity...<br /><br />Delivery time:&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve made about ten orders so far for coke with Dispater. All of them bar one have arrived in one working day (one took two days). This actually correlates very neatly with Royal Mail&#039;s estimated delivery times for 1st class mail. In other words - if you see that your order has been marked &quot;in transit&quot; it really is in transit and assuming you ordered it on a weekday - it will probably arrive the next day.<br /><br />Without revealing too much about myself, my business involves posting thousands of 1st class parcels each year (legit, not SR) so I know from real life experience that 95% of 1st class parcels will (on average) arrive in one working day. Any UK vendor that says otherwise is either talking out of their arse, a liar or a just a lazy fucker that marks orders in transit days before they post it.<br /><br />The fact that 90% of the orders I&#039;ve made from Dispater have arrived in one working day is to me absolute proof that not only does Dispater treat his work as a serious, full-time profession but also that he doesn&#039;t bullshit you (I&#039;ve had a lot of bullshit from other vendors such as &quot;it isn&#039;t unusual for 1st class to take a week&quot;).<br /><br />Any regular coke users reading this will no doubt agree with me that one of the most important qualities a dealer can have is an appreciation of their customers&#039; impatience. Seriously, how often do you plan a coke session a week in advance? So for speed of delivery I&#039;d give top marks here. <br /><br />Coke quality:<br /><br />Dispater&#039;s coke always arrives in a rock form, sometimes many small rocks, sometimes one single rock.&nbsp; I&#039;m not so naive that I think that a rock equals high purity. I&#039;m well aware of re-rocking (something I learned in my wilderness years). Nevertheless, seeing a nice solid rock makes me feel happy - it&#039;s an assurance that at least someone up the chain gives a fuck. By the way, for anyone still using razors to chop rocks - use a spoon to crush it instead.<br /><br />The buzz from a 75mg line is very euphoric and gives a great wired feeling. Although there is of course no doubt that this coke is heavily cut (most is), it is way higher purity than the coke available to me with an hour&#039;s notice. What is noticeable is the lack of active cuts: there isn&#039;t a significant crash half an hour after a line and I personally haven&#039;t noticed any trouble sleeping after doing some. Admittedly I do feel a considerable need to redose after 40 mins but to be honest I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever find coke that doesn&#039;t make me feel that way.<br /><br />There are two coke dealers on SR that I have used whose coke is fucking brilliant (and advertise it as such) but I would honestly prefer 2 grams of Dispater&#039;s to one gram of theirs (it still works out cheaper from Dispater).&nbsp; I&#039;m certain that I get more coke per pound spent from Dispater even if the purity is lower.<br /><br />Weight<br /><br />Almost every coke order I&#039;ve received from Dispater has been overweight, usually by 10%.&nbsp; When you consider that most non-SR dealers in the UK sell grams that weigh 0.6-0.7g you realise that this is fantastic value for money.<br /><br />Communications<br /><br />Dispater says fuck all. Really. He will respond quickly to PMs but he is economical with words.&nbsp; I find this reassuring as he is happy to let the product/price speak for itself.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve bought more from him than any other SR vendor I&#039;ve rarely had any reason to exchange more than a few words which is probably how it should be I suppose.<br /><br />Stealth<br /><br />100%. Only sends UK2UK so who gives a fuck really. It is very well smellproofed.&nbsp; If your address and name is correct it will arrive.<br /><br /><br />Think that&#039;s everything I need to say actually.&nbsp; May update if I think of anything else but in summary I&#039;ll keep on using Dispater until he moves on and I&#039;ve said it before but I wish to fuck there were a lot more vendors on SR with Dispater&#039;s approach - Honest, fast and straightforward.&nbsp; Without doubt my favourite vendor here.

				Right then. Dispater has the best quality and cheapest coke on SR. Super fast delivery too. Why would you not buy from him?! Seriously, I have bought coke from all the regular UK SR sellers and this guy is by far the best. Weight always good, quality always good, packaging always good. I cannot praise him enough.

				Lets not beat around the bush......Disapter is a top class vendor who clearly takes his business very seriously and aims to please his customers. I wanted to write this so that any new members to SR can look at this review and realise that this vendor is to be trusted 100%. I have used most of the coke vendors on SR from the UK and not one provides the quality and amazing delivery times that this guy does.<br /><br />Quality - Top quality product for the money. He is not claiming it is pure and un-cut but as someone who does a fair amount of coke I can confirm that it is good and has a lovely high.<br /><br />Delivery - No one can match his delivery times. It has also been 2 days from sending my order until it arrives on my doorstep.<br /><br />Stealth - Great and have ordered probably 10/15 times from him and all orders have got through no problem.<br /><br />Communication - Short and sweet lol. A man a few words but that is because the product is with you so quick you don&#039;t need to worry and keep asking where it is.<br /><br />Overall - BEST VENDOR ON SR FOR COKE BY A MILE!!!!!!!

				---------------Background to user (my mate SWIM&nbsp; :))---------------<br />SWIM usually takes pills/MDMA at the weekend though to be honest he is fed up of being wiped out. SWIM has had too much unwanted emotional bonding with others and can&#039;t hack the comedowns/fear anymore. If you&#039;re with the right people it can be the best but very often you don&#039;t know where the night is going to lead you. This is where the interest in coke comes from.<br /><br />SWIM has tried street coke but the price and duration of its effects doesn&#039;t make it an economical drug. SWIM has had about 5 orders with disapter for amounts under 1g. On all occasions SWIM has shared it with friends when he really doesn&#039;t want to because it costs loads!<br /><br />---------------Delivery---------------<br />Usually SWIM places his orders in the evening. Disapter always posts the next day so within the UK SWIM gets it the following day. SWIM can&#039;t ask for more really. Amazing.<br /><br />Packaging consists of an envelope with the coke sealed and smell proof. Perfect for domestic delivery. Can&#039;t ask for more.<br /><br />---------------The Coke---------------<br />Rocks. SWIM crushes them up and sometimes little bits go flying and his heart sinks! This stuff costs too much to be liberal!<br /><br />SWIM snorts maybe a 50-100mg line and wow! Buzzing his tits off for the next hour and a nice easy comedown.<br /><br />SWIM always mix with drink and goes very nicely. Adds a nice controllable dimension to the night that you just don&#039;t get from alcohol alone. MDMA you don&#039;t know wtf you are doing most of the time and you can&#039;t enjoy drink.<br /><br />---------------Weight---------------<br />Never under.<br /><br />---------------Finalising---------------<br />First 2 orders had to FE. Now he doesn&#039;t but always makes the effort to clear it upon arrival ASAP.<br /><br />---------------Summary---------------<br />Basically if disapter keeps up this level of service, SWIM will keep ordering. Cheers.

				I has very happy. order was processed in lightning time and the quality was excellent. The best was actually seeing what a full g of C actually looks like and makes you realize how ripped off you have been in the past with quantity&#039;s.

				I got a half gram of coke of Dispater for my first SR order - FE&#039;d early as requested. Arrived the next day packaged discreetly and vacuum packed. Got a gram a few weeks later, FE&#039;d early and perfect again. Have ordered coke from Dispater several times now and the service is always faultless.<br /><br />Quality is great and size is always on point, I can&#039;t see why anyone wouldn&#039;t use Dispater - quick service and great communication from a trustworthy seller, end of.

				I&#039;m no coke connoisseur but I tried a few of the coke vendors when I started using SR and found Dispater to be by far the best. The stuff always gives an excellent euphoric rush. No bullshit about purity levels like other vendors do. Prices always the best and delivery times are excellent as well, almost always next day. Now I wouldn&#039;t use anyone else.

				Here is my honest review of Dispater&#039;s Coke, if any other information warranted being added, good or bad i would have added without issue.<br /><br />I have been ordering Coke from Disapater since joining SR 2 mths ago and has been without doubt the smoothiest transactions of all of my 24 orders including other products domestic and within EU, not ordered outside EU as yet.<br /><br />Delivery is so reliable i wonder if he used to work for amazon and stole processes they used and applied to his business. If you order the night before or before lunch time next day you are almost guaranteed to get next day.<br /><br />Quality of coke - It is pyschological i am sure, but when coke arrives in rock it does give a feeling of well being even though i have the experience to know it can be mean little. It has always arrived in rock to me and part of the excitement/ritual of crushing and preparing. It gives a nice clean buzz and good euphoric feeling<br /><br />Price wise - Can not go wrong. I have tried other SR vendors for this product both domestic and EU and this is great value and little concern over customs as it is domestic for me? <br /><br />Weightwise i have never had an issue<br /><br />Communications - embarasingly, the only time i ever had to contact Disapater was to apologises for a daft error i made<br /><br />Stealth - no issue UK wise and i have had EU deliveries with less stealth employed<br /><br />Summary - At present, dispater is a rock solid vendor with good quality value for money with great deliveries times. <br /><br />Dont assume non EU products which and/are more expensive than Disapater are better quality or will suit your requirements better. Dispater is a MUST vendor try at the very least, i would bet a couple of BTC that you may find yourself ordering from Dispater more than others, as i do.<br /><br />Hope this helps <br />

				So got my order.. ordered late friday afternoon and received sat morn.... again! (all gone now of course haha) really happy with the speedy service.. as i said previously the coke itself isnt that strong but its fairly cheap and does the trick.. its also consistent.. i have ordered his coke a number of times over a long time scales (months) and the stuff is always the same. I&#039;m surprised at the amazing reviews it gets though tbh after looking at the feedback which read along the lines of &#039;mindblowing&#039; and &#039;excellent&#039;... it certainly isn&#039;t that. I guess for cocaine naive persons this may seem the case though.. If you were to compare the product alone to say Lloyds brothers or c63&#039;s from holland then it wouldnt have a leg to stand on tbh.. but like I said thats product alone.. service and price wise its a good deal.

				Hi. Formerly a user on here by the username Marlou but forgot my login! LOL.<br />I just wanted to update my previous reviews of Dispaters Coke. I&#039;ve only been using his for 2 months but must say that what he distributes is great quality. I ordered a G yesterday in the late afternoon and was expecting it to arrive on Wednesday but it was here this morning (less that 24 hours later) in it&#039;s usual stealth packaging. I have just tested it (that&#039;s what made me re-register to write this) and found that it is the purest yet! I ordered a G from another seller last week to get a comparison (Not mentioning who but it was almost double the BC) and after testing found it was less quality that Dispater and also under weight (only by 0.06g but hey, I paid for it!) That&#039;ll teach me a lesson for testing the water somewhere else!<br />On top of that, a friend gave me half a G of street gear at the weekend and the comedown was immense! I&#039;ve never had anything like that from Dispater. Get the usual stuffy nose but if your sensible that can be combated (break out the aspirin and the tissues!)<br />Dispater has got to be the best vendor in the UK right now! Thanks Dispater!

It elevates you heart and tastes nice.&nbsp; Service is also great.<br />

				Look, Dispater is a good honest seller, you get your shit next day 99% of the time.<br />He dont fuck about and the quality is good enough, you get what you pay for but his service is better than any other seller so stop asking questions and order from the guy.<br />Seriously, I cant recommend highly enough
