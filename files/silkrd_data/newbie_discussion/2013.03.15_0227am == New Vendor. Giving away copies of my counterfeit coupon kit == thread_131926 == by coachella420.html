				I have momentarily decided to give away copies of my coupon kit which includes a 51 page guide, barcode tools, and easy to use templates. The PDF guide can teach you everything you could ever possibly want to know about counterfeit coupons.<br /><br />The only favor I ask in return is, if your appreciate the kit, please leave feedback for me.<br /><br />You can pick up the guide from my vendor listing here<br /><br />&nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f5381ce491<br />

				Honestly I understand your guys concern. If its any consideration what I had originally planned to sell did not work out about a year ago. I recently decided to put this vendor account to use.<br /><br />I have not, nor do I intend to ask for FE, ever. Order the book for yourselves and see for yourselves. Its free right now.<br /><br />wraithe, I see your a frequent poster in PL threads.<br /><br />Thanks for looking out for others. One can never be too safe on the road.

				Honestly I am the original owner, however, I have had several messages lately from another user attempting to blackmail me. Not sure if its a follower of another popular coupon guru here at SR.<br /><br />I&#039;m just here to sell a product guys, nothing more. What im doing is nothing different then other vendors who give samples and only charge shipping.

You do shit like this, knowing how hard it is for a new vendor to get any rep. Anyone who has taken a basic economics class knows that when a market has little or no competition, it usually fucks its customers in the ass as hard as they can, however, competition is the best thing possible for consumers in helping to keep prices competitive. <br /><br />You would know that, if you didn&#039;t spend all day getting your ass hole blown out by purple lotus.

				Alright guys, pulling this guide down. After having 8 people not leave feed back, and 1 person even going as far as to call me a &quot;fraud&quot; because I &quot;Never said it did not include coupons,&quot; it aint worth it. I will be selling shrooms in about 2 months, so watch out for a major sample give away.<br /><br />Sorry for the free ebook silkroad.

				He means Purple lotus.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be clear on this, I am NOT reselling anything purple lotus created. This guide was created by Lucas Townsend Henderson a/k/a “The Coupon Guy” who was arrested and convicted on two separate felonies for creating this guide.
