				It seems that with there being multiple sites ( SR, BMR, Atlantis ) to do business with that there is a potential breeding ground for scumbags like Sam Giancana. Whats to prevent these Rogue vendors from either setting up a new account here at SR using a different name or worse yet rotating between the sites scamming honest buyers by the hundreds. Can the Admin at SR ID an IP address with everything been sent thru TOR, and is there any chance they would be willing to share information in regards to rogue vendors with other sites. I have no desire to move away from SR..... they simply have the best site going. <br /><br />On a different note it seems that since SR was mentioned on the mainstream media there has been an obvious influx of CHILDREN as evidenced by the post put up by the IDIOT CHILD supposedly using a funnel to put crushed XTC up his ass. As humorous as the post was I would be willing to bet that since the exposure on main stream media there has definitely been a HUGE influx of minors who have no business even trolling a site like SR. It&#039;s a shame that Admin can&#039;t devise a way to filter the children from the adults.

				Identify an IP address?&nbsp; If that could be done, none of us would be here.&nbsp; Lots of people have speculated that ScamG, theTeflondon, and mtljohn were all the same person but there is no way to verify that.<br /><br />Personally, i dont care if kids are on here.&nbsp; If they are determined enough to find silk road, make an account, get bitcoin, and have the drugs shipped to themselves then they are probably determined and smart enough to get drugs from someone IRL too.

				There are advantages and disadvantages to total anonymity on the internet. <br /><br />Did you seriously believe, when you first heard about tor, that there wouldn&#039;t be people abusing the power that comes with being completely anonymous? Hell, that&#039;s how the DEA and FBI view us, but they bite their tongue and move along. And so do we with these degenerates who find shelter under SR&#039;s bandwidth

				Obviously my understanding of TOR was WAAAAY off so I feel pretty fucking stupid for even asking ....... never used TOR or even new it existed prior to joining SR. As to the comments regarding our youth buying drugs off SR ...... although I don&#039;t have any young ones at home .... I did raise 3 and put 2 thru college and I it&#039;s anybody&#039;s guess if this would have happened had they had access to a site like SR in the early teen years. So yes I have a conscience&nbsp; when it comes to minors using SR. I don&#039;t troll and no further responses required.

You should do some reading about how Tor works; it&#039;s good stuff to know as it will help keep you anonymous! :)<br /><br />You can read more about Tor on the Tor homepage:<br />https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en<br /><br />Also, please make sure you&#039;re at least using the Tor Browser Bundle, which you can download at www.torproject.org, and make sure to keep it up to date! Using clearweb (regular internet) sites such as onion.to to access Silk Road and the forums are not anonymous as they simply offer you a proxy with which to view .onion (onion network) sites. It is possible for the people that run the onion.to proxy to see your real IP address, and also to log your usernames and passwords if they wished to do so.<br /><br />Everybody is of course free to their own opinions regarding any topic, but personally I feel that if somebody is old enough to do the necessary research about a drug and use the drug safely, then they should be able to purchase it. This is my own opinion, of course, and not reflective of Silk Road policy. The young person in question was making a much smarter choice buying from Silk Road than buying off the street, both for purity and security reasons.<br /><br />The drugs available on Silk Road are generally much cleaner than what people will find on the street - that is the beauty of free-market economics: vendors with bad quality products won&#039;t last very long, and vendors with good products will have to up their quality to compete with vendors that provide excellent products!<br /><br />Furthermore, as this is a free market, Silk Road should not - as a matter of course - deny any free person that wishes to purchase here. Silk Road is not just a place where people can come to buy any product that they wish, legal or otherwise. It is a bastion of freedom in a world where freedom is being evermore restricted by world governments.<br /><br />Welcome to the future of freedom. :)<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks for the info on TOR ...... very helpful ..... I would be embarrassed to tell you how I thought the damn thing worked. Basically thought it was merely a portal that delivered the user to the SR website anonymously where Admin then controlled anonymity.&nbsp; Your sentiment concerning the youth on SR is widely shared. I agree with your opinions concerning the freedoms and the oppression of such. I&#039;m not sure where you live and no I&#039;m not asking but with the exception of a major city like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles ....... where can the average 16 or 17 year old go and get virtually ANY drug out there ....I mean literally A to Z.&nbsp; That&#039;s my only point ..... agree SR is safer ...... agree drugs are cleaner ...... how many underage people are trying drugs they would normally not have had access to. Maybe I&#039;m living in a cave, my running the street days have been gone long ago, and prior to SR my purchases were always from other professionals. I&#039;m not trying to turn this into a thread so please no response just wanted to get it off my chest. Appreciate the job SR and moderators do with the forums ..... best tool on SR and NOOBS&nbsp; should use the forums to their advantage.

				All the more reason you teach your kids realistic drug safety from an early age. I do my best to teach my kid that certain drugs are not likely to kill you, but others definitely can. Same with different types of booze. Preaching to the choir here, of course.

We ALL have to learn about EVERYTHING sometime! :)<br />Piggybacking on the anonymity issue, administrators / moderators do not &#039;control&#039; anything here, per se. This is a free community that evolved out of a free market, and discussion on any topic is welcome. We moderate to keep things easy to find and the like, but we do not control. Every user is responsible for his or her own actions here.<br /><br />I live in a relatively small place, a &#039;village&#039; some would call it, and in a VERY good area. Despite this (or perhaps because of it), within 400 feet of where I&#039;m sitting I can get my hands on literally ANY drug that is offered on Silk Road. Most of them are terrible quality, but they&#039;re there. I know all the people that sell them so I know that for a fact. All of those drugs are actually closer to me than alcohol or tobacco, with the nearest store being about 500 feet away! Ironic, eh! ;D<br /><br />Trying drugs is not a problem for young people, regardless of whether they are legal or illegal. It is the misuse and abuse of drugs that is a problem (but if it is a problem for them personally, and it is harming none but themselves, what right has anyone to tell them to stop?) Alcohol, for instance, is one of the most destructive drugs out there. People drink that without any judgement being passed on them - for the most part - all the time.<br /><br />I am trying drugs that I had access to, but that I refused to use because of what might be in them. Now I can get clean ephedrine for working out better than I can naturally, Valium to relax me in the very occasional circumstance that I wish to use it, Viagra to satisfy my other half&#039;s ridiculous sex drive and the occasional THC edible that I had never tried before but was seriously missing out on the fun of.<br /><br />This place represents the freedom to do all of that, and more going forward. When you realise that you are experiencing TRUE freedom to do as you wish with YOUR body without anybody restricting you, that is an incredibly powerful eye-opener.<br /><br />Without Silk Road, I&#039;d be a much different person - and that person is somebody that I would never want to be again.<br /><br />Libertas
