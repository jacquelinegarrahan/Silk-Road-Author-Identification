				I am ready to make my first purchase, so while logged into SR, I clicked &#039;Click here to make a deposit&#039;.&nbsp; I received a long warning ending in &quot;Once you are ready, send your deposit to this address:&quot; followed by a alpha-numeric address of 30+ characters.&nbsp; I logged into my blockchain.info account and sent the money to the address given to me by SR.&nbsp; This was about 50 minutes ago.&nbsp; When I look under my transactions at blockchain.info, the SR address is correct, and the transaction shows 8 confirmations.&nbsp; However, my SR account still shows 0.00 bitcoins.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; How long do these transfers take?&nbsp; The transfer that I am waiting on is already insufficient for my transaction because I transferred the exact amount.<br /><br />Many thanks in advance!<br />

				Your initial transaction has enough confirmations (6), before your Silkroad account shows the bitcoin balance however you will need to wait for the transaction between your deposit address and your silkroad wallet to reach (6). If you go on the blockchain and search your deposit address you should see an outgoing transaction to your silkroad wallet address. You can track progress there.

				Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; The transfer has gone through, although I probably won&#039;t do an exact amount again as I have .01 too few Bitcoins for my purchase, which means ...<br />another transfer.&nbsp; I&#039;ll go and do something productive while this one clears.

				Yeah it normally takes 2-3 hours to show up on SR. <br /><br />Myself I like to keep a small buffer of spare change in my SR wallet just to negate such problems with currency fluctuations. Similarly if the BTC exchange rate goes up tonight, due to most sellers prices being pegged to USD, tomorrow you may find you once again have enough funds for your order without needing to add to them.<br /><br />Oh yeah and welcome to the greatest, most revolutionary, website on the planet!

				dont feel bad i had problems with my first bit coin purchase too they ended up holding my coins for like 7 days before i could use them but it worked out good for me cause the value of my coins went from 87 dollars to 125 dollars during that time so i ended up being able to purchase more than i thought id be able to

				No big deal.&nbsp; The delay made me think that I might have screwed something up and been out $$$.&nbsp; Now that I know the delay is to be expected, I won&#039;t worry about it.<br /><br />Even though there&#039;s a process, SR is still light years better than going to the hood to buy Mexican brick weed.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post again when I have my bud.
