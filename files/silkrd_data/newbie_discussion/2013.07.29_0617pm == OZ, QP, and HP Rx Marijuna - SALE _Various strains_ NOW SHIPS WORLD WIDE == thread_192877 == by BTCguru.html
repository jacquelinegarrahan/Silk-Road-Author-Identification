				<br />Hi everyone we just got more buds in and are having yet another sale this week to promote our services world wide. oz for less than $200 and QP for less than $700. thats 20% off for everyone, its the same great quality you have come to expect from BTCguru after half of our current stock is gone we will raise the prices to normal which is Oz- $225, QP-800. and so&nbsp; on.. also we are working on getting pound listings, we have found it is probably easier to send full Lb in multiple packages<br /><br />Curent Strains:<br /><br />1) Purple Thunder Fuck: Seattle thunder Fuck x Grand Daddy Purple look up the parent strains on the internet to get an idea of this one as I cant find a good description. the buds are not as big as purple cream but they are still very dank!<br /><br />2)<br />Purple Cream: purple Erkle x Grand Daddy Purple if Im not mistaken. it has an amazing sandalwood and grape aroma and some good size buds as well.<br /><br />3)PitBull: The indica-dominant Pit Bull strain begins with a trade: som P-91 seed from the university professor who created the P-91 strain. Stoney Girl was told that this strain was the government’s latest G-13. P-91 came from a program at a university in Southern California that supposedly did not exist. This grandfather of the Pit Bull’s paternal side was crossed with Stoney Girl’s own Berkeley Blues to become a strain called Sugar Plum. Sugar Plum, an award winner that placed first in the 2003 Oregon medical cannabis awards, is Pit Bull’s father. The Pit Bull mother, simply referred to as P-91, is a cross from Southern California, consisting of a G-13 mother crossed with Bull Rider.<br /><br />4) Afghan: not sure about the genetics on this one. It has a spicy hash flavor and is loaded with THC, extremely frosty.<br /><br />Modify message<br />
