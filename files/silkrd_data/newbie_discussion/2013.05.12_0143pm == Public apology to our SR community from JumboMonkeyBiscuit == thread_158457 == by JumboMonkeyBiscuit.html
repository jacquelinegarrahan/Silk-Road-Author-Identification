				Hello SR family,<br /><br />We apologize to all our customers who have been affected by our Moneypak bottleneck. We are currently working on getting the issues resolved so we can be up and running again like the well oiled machine we want to be. We hope everyone understands that we canceled orders because we were going to be unable to process them within the next 72 hours. Please be careful who use while we are away in getting your bitcoins. We have already received notices of Ramo400 and KwikFick being scammers. We are pretty sure their are others so just please search their username here in the forums before handing over your money. <br /><br />We will be online throughout our time away so leave us a message or comment and we will get back to you. Again we&#039;re sorry for the inconvenience moneypak has put us in. Please know we are working hard to get things up and going again.<br /><br />Moneypak is changing the ways ALL of us will be able to handle these types of transactions. The US government is cracking down on AML. We need to complete a long term solution to this bitcoin cashing out and bitcoin purchasing strategy or markets like Silk Road are going to suffer even more.<br /><br />Thank you again for understanding<br /><br />JmB

				No offense dood as I am sure you are cool given your rep, but how can everyone whose orders you canceled verify funds on their MoneyPak anonymously? I am sure anyone who is going to try and use a new BTC supplier does not want to hear that there is no money on the card and wonder who robbed them especially those that have not done business with you before.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is there any way to verify funds on a moneypak card anonymously? I think your customers, especially those who have not used you before would like to do this before moving on. I figured it might help everyone else too. Thanks for your time

				So I guess there is no way to check the balance anonymously on the moneypak for all the orders you canceled?

				I&#039;m not sure about anonymously, but you can log into PayPal, click on &quot;Add Funds&quot; and select the MoneyPak option.&nbsp; You can then input the MP info and submit it.&nbsp; It will then tell you the balance on that MP, and from that screen, just be sure to cancel or return to PayPal without funding your account.&nbsp;

				Sorry for the slow response. We are trying to get better at frequenting the forums. Thank you for the follow up SCOUT..... I can assure all users that we had to cancel orders from that we DID NOT process any cards. Our ability to process them was cut off until today. We had no way to process them. Thank you for understanding.<br /><br />JmB

				Hey dude - I just ordered from you and sent the info in my order.<br /><br />Are you capable of handling the orders? It was for over $400.<br /><br />If so, please let me know... and please don&#039;t cash it...<br /><br />Thanks!

				Hey guys had a real quick and awesome transaction with this guy.<br /><br />Prob most trouble free on SR. Communication was extremely quick and professional (something I&#039;m not used to) and the entire transaction was completed quickly.
