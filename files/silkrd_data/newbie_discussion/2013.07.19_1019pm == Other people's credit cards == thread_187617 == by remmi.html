				So, I wanna use a stranger&#039;s credit card to buy some shit online. <br />1. Where should I send the stuff? I don&#039;t want to send it to my house or a friend&#039;s, just can&#039;t.<br />2. Should I use a public computer, or should I be fine if I use Tor?<br />Anyway, thanks to anyone who can help.

				I know all the good advice has been said, but to the OP: imagine if their utilities get cut off, or someone in their family dies and they can only pay for plane tickets, etc using that credit card? And the panic and stress of not being able to do so because credit card has been declined. Hey, i&#039;ve done my dirt too when i was younger, but i wasn&#039;t thinking about how i was affecting others. Nevermind the RIGHT/WRONG of it. Just put yourselves in the person&#039;s shoes whose credit card it is, and try to imagine if it was you how pissed and awful you would feel that someone ripped you off. If you seriously try to see it in that perspective, you would not do what it is your trying to do.

Not only does SR make selling and buying &quot;illegal&quot; drugs among other things safe and anonymous for both vendor and buyer, it also introduces a little bit of humanity in it as opposed to the shadiness of buying/selling out in public. I&#039;m talking about looking over your shoulder for LE, wondering if your getting real shit or even robbed. There&#039;s a list , but it goes on and on and on and on and on. It&#039;s assholes like the OP that makes me pay a premium for shit I could get on the street at half the cost sometimes, just for not having to deal with douche-dick thieves like this one!

				I made a purchase for some shoes on ebay when i was 19 so about 11 years ago, i used paypal but still someone got ahold of my identity.&nbsp; they maxed out my card and it wasnt covered by mastercard. it was over $2500 they stole from me.... now that transaction isnt the only reason that i have bad credit but i ended up disabled and having that on my credit history has made my life very difficult. <br /><br />think about the affect you are going to have on someones life not just now but how it can affect them in the future BEFORE you destroy their credit history and make it harder for them to own a house or a car. The companies and banks dont want to pay if you scam someones card and will look for any reason not to cover their loss. <br /><br />I was also just ripped off by a vendor on SR because I trusted enough to FE. It was only a few bitcoins but it almost left me homeless trying to cover that loss. <br /><br /><br />THINK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE DONT BE SO SELFISH!!
