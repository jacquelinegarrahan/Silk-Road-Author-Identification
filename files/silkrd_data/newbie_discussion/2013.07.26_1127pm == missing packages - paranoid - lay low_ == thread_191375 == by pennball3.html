				I have made several successful purchases on SR of varying products &amp; vendors over the past few months.&nbsp; All arrived successfully within a few days via USPS.&nbsp; Recently, I placed two orders; one 12 days ago and one 9 days ago.&nbsp; Neither have arrived (yet).&nbsp; <br /><br />If neither shows up, have I been &quot;flagged&quot; somehow (USPS or other) and should lay low on making further purchases on SR for a while?

				Where are you ordering from? Maybe it&#039;s just taking a long-ass time.<br /><br />I would recommend not making any more purchases until these ones show up, though...

				depending on where you live in the us you might wanna lay low, it&#039;s always good to have a clean house <br />anyway. sometimes just takes longer than normal, they don&#039;t call it snail mail for nothin&#039;<br />How long did you say it has been{not including weekends}

				I always just place one order and wait for it to arrive before I place the next one. In your situation I would just lay low for a while, clean house and wait
