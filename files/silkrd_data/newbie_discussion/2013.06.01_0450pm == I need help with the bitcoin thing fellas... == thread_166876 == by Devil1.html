				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				Are you in the USA?????<br /><br />If so, this is what I posted in response to another dude&#039;s similar post . I&#039;m not sure if things work different in other countries.<br /><br /><br />Create a blockchain wallet, then while your on your blockchain wallet page, hit the deposit cash link. It will walk you thru the process, which, utilizes bitinstant for the deposit. Again, it will walk you thru it. .Moneygram doesn&#039;t do bitcoiuns per say, it is just used to send money, from their point of view, your just paying&nbsp; bill.<br />Here&#039;s how it works<br /><br />1- create a wallet on blockchain, it&#039;s anonymous<br />2- hit the cash deposit link (this must be done with your wallet page open)<br />3- it will walk you thru the process and give you all the info you need to take to a moneygram outlet<br />4- at moneygram, you will send your $$$ to an intermediate company,given to you by blockchain/bitinstant, I wont mention the name here but to moneygram it looks like your paying a bill...(bitinstant will give you a receiver code for the intermediate co, this code ID&#039;s that company for moneygram so they know who to send it to)<br />4- this intermediate company will do the rest and your dollars will magically appear in your blockchain wallet as bitcoins<br />5- transfer to your SR wallet (it can take a few hours for this transfer to go thru, don&#039;t worry , it works)<br /><br />The reason for the middle wallet is security, and, I&#039;m not sure you can deposit right into the SR wallet, unless you trust one of the SR bitcoin vendors to do it but that is done outside the escrow system and it&#039;s easy for them to burn you, and, they can sometimes take&nbsp; lot longer than most people would like.<br /><br />I hope that all made sense.<br /><br />Everyone has their own method, this one seems easy to me and I can usually have the funds on the Road and ready to use in a matter of like 1.5 to 3 hours, start to finish.

If a member wishes to download a PDF with which it is possible that their system may be compromised, that is their own decision. If they are not aware that PDF&#039;s can compromise a system, that is their own fault.

Please have a look through the Security forum for more information on securing yourself from possible malware etc. - the best advice I can give you is to open them inside a Virtual Machine. You can read more on Virtual Machines both here on the forums and with a search on Google.<br /><br />Libertas
