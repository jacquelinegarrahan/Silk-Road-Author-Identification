				I´ll be straight and get right to the point! I am not interested in making 50 posts so i can be one of the gang here.When you think about it, my life must really be a big mess if i have to spend my time worrying about garbage like that. So who cares. What´s the benefit? I get to be a big boy and post my opinion on the BIG BOY FORUM.? You know what scares me ? The fact that if i want to buy something and i think that the vendor is a pompous asshole,that just because he makes money for himself and the Road i could be blackballed! I am older than most of the people here and that concerns me as well. I´ll tell you how i really feel now! if someone is making money here for the road, they could do no harm,but God forbid you get a new guy like me here and i go to buy something and the guy let´s my order sit in limbo and when i send him 5 emails and he doesn´t respond like i´m his stepchild,and then i yell him what´s really on my mind and thew guy calls me a fucking asshole that no one wants to deal with me well. THAT´S A PRETTY BROAD STATEMENT DON´T YOU THINK. That concerns me Mr, Vladmir.Is that the way to welcome a new member here that takes a chance with MY HARD EARNED MONEY ON YOUR BULLSHIT?&nbsp; I am a simple guy. I pay you deliver! Mr. Roberts wants to have vendors judge buyers. So judge me! I DO BUSINESS THE RIGHT WAY.<br />I try to be a gentleman i ask information and then i´ll buy if i feel comfortable.I´ll ask as many questions as i want until i feel that i have someone solid.Anything wrong with that.? Well some of these vendors seem to think so.This idiot tells me after i placed an order with him and he doesn´t respond after who knows how many times i asked him for some help and says to me to GO TAKE MY SHITTY BIT-COINS AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.So let me ask you something Mr. Roberts. How does the road deal with people like that? Now i have to worry about having bad buyer stats? if the little boy vendors are so worried about their little bit-coins i´ll FE every order i buy but don´t let me catch you trying to beat me. YOU KNOW IT SAYS HERE DON´T F.E ANYTHING TO VENDORS AND I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH THAT BUT I ALSO AGREE WHEN THE VENDOR DID THEIR JOB ,PAY THEM AND PAY THEM RIGHT AWAY. THEY EARNED IT! BUT IF YOU DON´T LIKE ME TELL ME MSG TO MSG, BUT DON´T YOU DARE PUT A NEGATIVE COMMENT THAT I AM A BAD BUYER BECAUSE THE LAST TIME I LOOKED I DON´T OWE ANYONE ANYTHING. AS A MATTER OF FACT&nbsp; I AM WAITING FOR THE SO CALLED ¡¨¨RESOLUTION DEPARTMENT TO RESOLVE WHY I HAVEN´T RECEIVED SOMETHING AFTER TEN DAYS AND I DO LIKE THE VENDOR VERY MUCH.You want to judge me, judge me if i pay for what i buy. That is what a buyer is supposed to do .IF YOU BUY ,PAY. if you make a rule not to F.E. a vendor then you tell me why this rule is broken every day of the week. I mean don´t get me wrong, i was a vendor years ago and a rather big one and yes there are some little weasels that look to take advantage of a real solid hard working vendor and they whine and lie sand cheat and try to get over. NO WE CAN NOT PUT UP WITH CRAP<br />LIKE THAT.However don´t judge me because you don´t like me and tear apart my buyer stats especially when i am first learning the right and wrong things to do. YOU SEE THAT´S JUST PLAIN NASTY AND INCONSIDERATE OF THE NEWBIE.You know people often forget that with out this ingenious site half of more of these vendors would be street peddlers and some of you buyers would still be getting taken off and beat out on the streets. PUT A LITTLE GRATITUDE IN YOUR ATTITUDE! Now&nbsp; Pirate Rob, you sure you want to have me post 49 more??? LOL!!Anyway I´m out with that.

Its becoming harder and harder to sell things on SR something is all ways changing with bitcoin&#039;s pgp and other crazy bull shit and vender&#039;s have a lot of buyer&#039;s trying to buy stuff its a lot to watch after it can be overwhelming. I don&#039;t know who Vladimir is or how he acts but dealing with a large volume of people can really get to you sometimes. 10 days is a long time to w8 i would agree with you there, but some venders do not ship every day, just try to relax bud and if you get a bad buyers ratting oh well fuck it its just pixels and paper. Hope everything works out well for you just try to keep a level head and keep up the good fight.
