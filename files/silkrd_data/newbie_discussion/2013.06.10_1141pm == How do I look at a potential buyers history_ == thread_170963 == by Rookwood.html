				Got a message from someone asking for a custom order but when I click on his name it just goes to send message. I just wanna verify they are legit because it&#039;s a large order.

				Can anyone help with this? I hate that I have to post in the noob section because I bet a lot of experienced vendors never drop by here. You think if you drop half a grand to become a vendor you could post in the goddamn forums man. Instead it&#039;s this or be a douche and make 50 useless topics. <br /><br />Guy wants to do a big custom order, I just wanna know if I can check out the info he is telling me such as his buying history. If I ship and get tracking then I WILL get paid right? He has to pay before I ship and if he doesn&#039;t release funds and I have the tracking number I&#039;ll still get paid? Any help here guys would be awesome.

				The only way you can see a buyers stats are if they place an order with you. You could set up a free listing and ask them to order it; then you could see their stats. <br /><br />Or else you could ask them to place the custom order and if you don&#039;t like the stats, you could cancel the order. If you do this, make sure the order isn&#039;t hedged or the customer will lose 4% of their money (hedging fee) if you cancel the order on account of not liking their stats.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				That does help. Thanks man. :)<br /><br />Oh one more thing. So I would change my setting to expose escrow? It says that&#039;s not recommended. Will I lose money if I cancel?
