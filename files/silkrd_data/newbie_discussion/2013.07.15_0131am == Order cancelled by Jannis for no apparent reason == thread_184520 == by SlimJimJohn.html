				I tried placing my first order ever on SR last night.&nbsp; I used all the recommended protocols.&nbsp; Today I was disappointed to discover that my order was cancelled and money refunded.&nbsp; Since Jannis appears to be the most highly regarded vendor in his class of product - i am just wondering if anyone has been having a similar experience - and knows how I might correct the situation

				Straight from the Jannis&#039;s Vendors Page <br /><br />*** Order Requirements ***<br /><br />I do not work with newcomers on the road. I check the stats of every order. You need to have spent twice the item value on the Silk Road before in order to buy it. The specific amount is specified in the item description.&quot;<br /><br />Always read the vendors page before ordering

				Well, it&#039;s probably because you&#039;re a newbie. A lot of vendors don&#039;t risk placing orders for newbs because they want to stay protected and avoid serving LE or getting scammed by new time buyers who threaten leaving 1/5 unless they get free product. I suggest making yourself known on the forums, it makes a huge difference. Try placing an order with vendors that will work with new buyers and don&#039;t require you to FE. Also buy small at first, test out the waters. And always read the vendors profile page to avoid wasting time. Check them out on the forums as well.

I have been on SR about a year now and I have had some of my orders cancelled also. It happens....shrug it off...find other Vendor....and just go on.... :)

				it sucks, but you&#039;ll need to establish a reputation of some sort. might need to purchase something else like weed to get ur stats up before more established vendors decide whether or not to deal to you. Good luck

I can, because I&#039;m a fan. - That&#039;s how that works.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Seems they&#039;re overwhelmed as it is. The last thing they need are a whole lot of newbies asking questions. Try building up your stats with another vendor, like an earlier poster said.
