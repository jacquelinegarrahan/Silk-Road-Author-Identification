				Blatantly stealing the idea from http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120811.0 except for newbies this time.<br /><br />So, I&#039;ll start with one of my stories.<br /><br />This was my first times smoking fake weed. The folks smoking with me later said that it had been an extra strong type, and I smoked about half of a joint that was meant to be for three people. For a few minutes I just stood around, smoking and talking.<br /><br />Next thing I remember, I&#039;m standing in a field of green glass cubes and existence is shrieking at me.<br /><br />What am I really doing?<br /><br />Turns out I went to pee, and got stuck with my pants down and my dick in my hands, just staring at the grass around me. I just stood there for about five minutes until my friends managed to snap me out of it.<br /><br /><br />Your turn!

				She said yes! It&#039;s really only crazy because we were both pretty unexcited about marriage, we are very committed to each other but don&#039;t need other&#039;s approval to seal the deal. But for some reason that night it just felt right. When crazy feels right.

				Took some LSD with three friends, one of whom had a camero that idled around 15 miles an hour.. We would get on top of the car and just ride and trip balls all over the back roads, while one person drove.. Well because of the car idled, my buddy who was driving was able to come up and hang out with us.. It took about 10 secouds for me to realize that no one is steering the car..

				This past weekend:<br /><br />Friday: 20mg xanax, countless beers and other alcoholic beverages and to top it all of smoking about 70mg of DMT.<br /><br />Result: MANY bruises and scrapes, zero memory and woke up alone in a bed belonging to a 23 years OLDER &quot;lady&quot; who slept on the couch because I made &quot;strange&quot; noises in my sleep.... Happy times! :D<br /><br />Saturday: 50mg valium, 4mg xanax, 6mg etizolam, once again: excessive alcohol intake.<br /><br />Result: Getting thrown out of the bar, then &quot;apparently&quot; two men at the age of about 55+ starts fighting with me! (all witnesses say that I was attacked unprovoked) <br />But my drunk (aka: fat) ass just falls over them, ending up on the ground and by some act of God (or beer) I´m able to make one of them bleed &quot;a lot&quot; from some face oriented cavity.<br />No cops so once again: Happy times! :D<br /><br />And I almost forgot, as to &quot;treat my battle wounds&quot; (yes I did get some more bruises that night as well) a &quot;lady friend&quot; came to visit me the day after and well... I´m easily cured ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Well this was a bit of topic but it´s one of the most fucked up drug related weekends I´v ever had!<br />&nbsp;
