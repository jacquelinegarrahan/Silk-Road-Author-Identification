				Normally when you click a vendor name the info page for that vendor comes up. In this case I cannot access said page (it takes me to my PM msgs with said vendor). <br />** How do you report a vendor issue with the account effectively closed like this? **<br /><br />BACKGROUND: <br />I ordered a nicely priced order and vendor assured order would be sent that day if I FE&#039;d for the order. I didn&#039;t FE and the next day vendor replied saying his account had been hacked and was being drained of funds, imploring me NOT to finalize the order. Then says previous msg asking for FE was from the hacker. <br /><br />It didn&#039;t add up so I offered him an account with fake credentials to use in the interim. He refused saying he&#039;d just bought a new account name and will swap over to that vendor name. I asked to clarify when order would be sent and all contact ceased.<br /><br />My issues: a hacker doesn&#039;t slowly drain funds, a hacker changes the password to prevent access, a hacker can chnage anything he wants but he sure as hell can&#039;t steal the ACTUAL PRODUCT (it&#039;s never arrived). <br /><br />Worst of all my funds are tied up waiting (I&#039;ve lost ~%20 of value with BTC dropping as it is) for RESOLVE to appear and as I mentioned first up, I can&#039;t access vendor info to report vendor. <br /><br />To me it feels like vendor added ridiculous prices on non-existent products then asking for FE in hope of scamming enough ppl before bowing out. How can I get my goddam ฿ back without waiting for resolve? And why did vendor ask me not to finalize? Is this just him playing the role of hacked vendor I&#039;m assuming?<br /><br />So to the Aussie vendor, please explain how a hacker stole ฿ AND actual physical matter please. This is the drug dealer bullshit SR is here to avoid. <br /><br />Anybody with input?

				Hard to say what with their not being proof for you that his account was hacked. Did you ask him for his new vendor name. If what he is telling you is true, then you should be able to contact the vendor on his new account and maybe work out a re-ship since all the error seems to be on his end. If not, i don&#039;t know what to tell you. Sorry man, i know that&#039;s a horrible feeling when you think that you have been had.

				Yes he told me the new vendor name but how do I find him to contact him? <br /><br />My question boils down to this: SR admins oversee disputes. How do I contact them to release the funds for an account which is closed without waiting for weeks until FINALIZE is an option (btw, how long until FINALIZE becomes clickable after order is dispensed?)

				You pretty clearly got taken for a ride, dude. You need to either take this to resolution or cut your losses. It doesn&#039;t sound like you&#039;re going to be able to get anything out of this vendor.
