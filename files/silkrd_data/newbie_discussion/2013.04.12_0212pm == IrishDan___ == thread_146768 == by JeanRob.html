				I placed an order with him late Friday night/early Saturday morning, it was marked in transit on Tuesday. Maybe it has just taken a few days extra? Hopefully everything is fine, I&#039;m new though so I&#039;m obviously freakin the heck out! Surely tomorrow will be the day right? He uses First Class Mail w/o signature. That stuff is suppose to be fast... maybe we can keep in contact so we know if its a buyer thing or one of us just not getting the order.

				I basically think that we should have faith in the guy and not flood him with messages. Its the USPS more than likely, not him. I have another order that said 3-5 days from an extremely reliable seller and its been six days on that as well. That makes me think its postal problems for sure. Now if it gets to like day 10 or day 14 and both are still not here.. I&#039;m probably gonna shoot myself in the face, but until then I&#039;m gonna hold off on thoughts of negativity/LE involvement.

				I agree that in a case where a reputable seller marked the order &quot;in transit,&quot; I would just be patient. First class mail can occasionally be incredibly slow.<br /><br />In my case, where the order remained &quot;processing&quot; after four days, I decided to just cancel the order. I hated to do that because I wanted the order. And I was concerned about the wildly fluctuating value of the bitcoin, but in this case, my refund was only about five bucks less than my payment. Apparently, I caught the bitcoin spike on the way up when buying, and on the way down when cancelling.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=146768.msg1006344#msg1006344">Quote from: BigStyles on April 12, 2013, 03:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">. . .

Or at least trying shooting your arm first to see if it hurts.<br /><br />JeanRob

My package has been &quot;In Transit&quot; since the 9th. I&#039;ve ordered from him before and it was fast but I&#039;m worried now because he hasn&#039;t replied to the message I sent him but he has been on SR the last couple days. I notice there is no recent feedback on any of his items so maybe he sent out a bunch of packages at once? Do you guys think my package is en route cuz I&#039;m getting really low on Xanax. Thanks and good luck to everyone else too.

				Burgerboy,<br />I also placed my order on the 6th/ transit on the 9th. I got a message from him a few hours ago. He said packages had been slow to arrive for some reason and that I would receive my order within the next 4 days. I take this as a good sign, I&#039;d say he had a glitch in supply or something that has probably been resolved now. I would stick with it and you might get your xan&#039;s before the weekend. The &#039;in transit&#039; thing is definitely abused though, I don&#039;t think it has any concrete link with when something is actually shipped out (in most cases). <br /><br />JeanRob,<br />No I didn&#039;t FE and I&#039;m definitely still holding off on any drastic actions&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Although I will say that DoctorFreedom shipped my order from India way faster than either of the two domestic guys I&#039;ve tried.

				I ordered from Dan early on April 7th. The privnote message that I sent with my order (containing my address) was opened on the 9th. According to his vendor&#039;s page, he apparently logged into SR each day. He did not open or read either of the two short PMs I sent, nor did he respond to a tormail message I sent.<br /><br />His most recent feedback seems to have turned sour. (But you can&#039;t trust that. For some inexplicable reason, buyers who receive shitty service, no service, or just plain get ripped-off will still leave a 5 of 5!) I just plain got a bad feeling, so I cancelled on the 11th, as soon as the &#039;cancel&#039; link became active.<br /><br />Dan&#039;s homepage says &quot;I ship items within 48 hours.&quot; and &quot;If you have any questions at all, Please ask.&quot; and &quot;Email is IrishDan@Tormail.Org, I check it twice a week&quot;<br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t harbor any ill-will. I hope Dan is OK. Of course, who knows what may have happened to Dan, since he has not modified the clearly false statements on his vendor page, and has not communicated with his recent customers.<br /><br />I think it is weird when a vendor stops communicating and stops filling his orders, especially at a time when bitcoin values are all over the charts.<br /><br />I would be very happy if Dan would refund the money I lost between making my order and cancelling my order. But I&#039;m not holding my breath.<br /><br />My advise is to look for a more reliable vendor for future orders.<br /><br />JeanRob

				I ordered the gador alpax xannies late evening April 1st and it remained processing until the 9th, when it was marked as in transit. I started to get worried towards the end of last week when someone left this as feedback...<br />&quot;Things seemed to be going alright then..., no product, then..., no communication. I&#039;m not angry. Just don&#039;t know what happened and the lack of communication was not good business.&quot;<br /><br />I sent him 3 messages notifying I had five days &#039;til resolve and he finally got back to me a couple days ago and said &quot;give it 3 more days and it will arrive.&quot; People who ordered ritalin from him around the same time I placed my order received it in a timely manner.That tells me it has nothing to do with the postal service.He mailed it on the 9th.Today is the 17th.I&#039;ll keep waiting for it but it&#039;s not looking good.I&#039;m really disappointed and pissed.<br /><br />Don&#039;t order from him.I know I won&#039;t ever again.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Received order yesterday and noticed his listing for this particular product is back up.This is only speculation but seems to me he was out but decided not to communicate that and leave me (and possibly others) hanging for almost a month.If that is the case I find that irritating and not okay.Vendors shouldn&#039;t be marking things in transit if they are not.11 days in the mail on the same side of the country? I don&#039;t know man.Anyway, i&#039;m satisfied it finally came however I SUSPECT THE PILLS TO BE FAKE.<br />
