				Hi everyone, this question is for all the music heads that I&#039;m sure this site is not lacking.<br /><br />We all know certain drugs make music so much more enjoyable, sometimes the its just so beautiful its ridiculous. What is the best experience you ever had combining the drugs and music. Please feel free to throw in awesome videos too they helped add to the magic.<br /><br />My most recent blissful drug/music melt was DMT and Infected Mushroom - Heavyweight.<br /><br />I recommend this experience to any and all, and do yourself a favor and watch the fan-made video on youtube with the fight scene from the movie &#039;Snatch&#039;. <br /><br />Looking forward to hearing your experiences.

				Godspeed You Black Emperor was practically made for robotripping. I&#039;m especially fond of Dead Flag Blues, the section with the train is great to kick you off into space.

				First time rolling on MDMA, listening to Sandiego - Axum.<br /><br />It&#039;s a proper minimal track, I&#039;d never felt so good in my entire life. Surprisingly, I&#039;ve never tried listening to music whilst tripping, would you recommend it?

				Pink Floyd&#039;s first album - The Piper At The Gates of Dawn. On shrooms, acid and ketamin. Doesn&#039;t get any better than this.<br /><br />A few years ago I took I wild dose of ketamine, couldn&#039;t even walk, and was listening the first song from the album on repeat: Astronomy Domine. <br /><br />Even when I&#039;m completely sober it gives me fucking chills, what kind of music they were able to make in 1967, using sampling, and what not before it was even called sampling. <br /><br />But I see most of you are posting some recent stuff I&#039;ve never heard of. I must be getting old,&nbsp; man oh man...fast forwarding into the 40s...Any old hacks like me who are into Pink Floyd and ketamine around here, or am I the odd one out? :)<br /><br />Peace,

				My first Dead show on acid. Everyone dancing and having fun. Such good vibes.<br /><br />As far as music on the radio. It was listening to the cd Are you Experienced on shrooms when cd technology just started(1987ish). The difference between the sound quality of a cassette tape or album as compared to a cd at the time was a trip in itself. I&#039;m dating myself, but those were the good old days. It was great to experience the beginnings of the majority of all the electronics, the internet etc. Just my 2c.

				No way Babyshiva, Pink Floyd is the best. Another epic &#039;melt&#039; I experienced recently was watching Metalguru&#039;s youtube video for &#039;Time&#039; on 2c-i ..insane fun.<br /><br />Seriously, you want to check out that video, all of his videos, a trippers dream.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZY2O906bDo

				LSD + Pink Floyd&#039;s Atom Heart Mother<br />WEED + Beach Boys&#039; Pet Sounds (though it was only weed it was some fucking strong weed I smoked at the beach that I couldn&#039;t even remember the room at the inn I was staying. It was fucking magical and opened the Beach Boys door to me).

				my most thought provoking and memorable have been concerts with just a simple dug out with good bud.&nbsp; Tool helped me open up to new ideas about my spirituality/Christianity. Muse helped me understand what type of woman would make me happy... (just after my first marriage.)

XXYYXX is the bee&#039;s knee&#039;s! I&#039;m actually very shocked that you know of his music. He is still fairly unknown but wow is that kid talented. I believe his first album came out when he was 16 or so. Even listening to his music sober is a trip.

				Anything works well with me when I&#039;m on drugs, I tend to just throw on the radio as I don&#039;t like to plan too much while on drugs haha.
