				I have noticed alot of users, or Ive assumed, a lot of users are using the SR username as their forum username, doesn&#039;t this take away<br />some anonymity? if your posting about your purchases (which vendors clearly appreciate trip reports and product feedback) your not really<br />protecting anonymity of forum UN and SR account UN who has made purchase<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wasn&#039;t even sure what to post this thread on the forum in, my SR name or a temp login... but im some posts deep... so why not continue getting the count<br />

				Yeah I kind of agree, I have an old forum username I used occasionally that was the same as my SR username but it just felt wrong. I&#039;m always paranoid someone will recognize the way I post or something and I don&#039;t want to be linked to all the shit I buy on SR. Probably just paranoia but better safe than sorry imo.

				My SR username is a completely random mixture of numbers and letters. I like it because its absolutely untracable. I feel like it might scare some sellers at first though, because it looks like something a spammer/scam artist would throw together to keep from being identified. Still, its all in the name of security.

				As a newb I was asking myself the same question. All the SR guides assume you already have a account.<br /><br />It&#039;s good to know that I can use different names.

				I&#039;m against the grain I guess... I see no loss in anonymity.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I see what you&#039;re saying though... but in that same vain, why even post reviews or post on the forums at all? <br /><br />I mean... like if LE knows who you are here, surely they know who you are on SR.&nbsp; (you obviously have some sort of security lapse)&nbsp; And if they already know who you are on SR, what does it matter what you are here?... obviously they don&#039;t need more info to track you down.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I don&#039;t see the point in having a different UN... well besides to separate buying and selling, which I would do.&nbsp; Am I saying use your UN&#039;s on the clearnet, no.&nbsp;

				Hahaha and here I&#039;ve been in the exact opposite position; frustrated that Vendors on SR had to go and get different names on the forum. It confused me for a bit. I have the same name, but I guess I should consider a change, eh?

				I really don&#039;t think it matters, especially if you just buy small quantities on here. Personal use isn&#039;t what LE is looking for here... As long as you never release information about who you are or where you live you should be fine.<br /><br />If you really think LE finding a connection between your accounts here and on SR is gonna help them find you in person, well then somewhere along the line you said too much about yourself.
