				Hey ppl,<br /><br />Im wanting to make an order from an international vendor into Australia. That being 28grams of MDMA. One of my close mates next door neighbours owns multiple homes and visits this one only a few times a year.. So basically its empty all year round and we were wanting to send the order there.<br />Would this work?<br />Has anyone has much success with ordering this amount or anything similar into Aus?<br /><br />Just needing some experienced SR users opinions on what is the safest way to go about this. <br />Cheers peeps!

				look for a good vendor with verifiable stealth shipping first, and do a small batch... if a small batch comes through and u open it and see that it is packaged safely, carry on with a larger order...<br />

				Thanks for the reply karrsix6six :)<br /><br />Well we were thinking of that, but would prefer to make one bigger order as we have a festival coming up. The vendor we have gotten in contact with has great feedback and says they&#039;ve successfully shipped to australia and no packages have gone missing.<br /><br />Will we be fairly safe doing this? As it wont be any of our address&#039; and fake name will be used.<br />I think it is worth the risk.<br />Plus ordering donestically in australia is far too pricey for what you get.<br /><br />Any responses will b greatly appreciated

It is a medium-sized marketbale quantity. They can and have done controlled deliveries for less. The vendors will tell you whatever they can to get you to make the purchase, probably also asking you to finalize early.

				Ive just read the story on google, However he was a vendor selling aswell, so he would have been receiving packages in bulk to his house on a regular. What I&#039;m doing is a one off and we plan on using a different address/name. <br />The vendors all have near perfect feedback and have had from 900-1100 transactions.<br />And Ive read quite a few 5/5 feedback from other fellow aussies. <br />So what there telling me is backed up with that. <br /><br />Thanks tho for the heads up tho, much appreciated.:)

The most likely case is that you don&#039;t receive anything and you lose your money. On top of that, you run the risk of being investigated because 28 grams is a lot.<br /><br />Shadh1 is not the only case. There have been a number of people who have been arrested and charged since then for sending drugs in the mail. The quantities involved were much less than 28 grams. I know you want to send it to an empty house but there are still a number of problems with that.<br /><br />Do I think you will get arrested doing this? no, but I don&#039;t think it is worth the risk given that it would cost you a few million dollars over the length of your life if you were. I think the most likely outcome is that your package doesn&#039;t arrive.

				well considering the vendor has over 1000 fans, Im guessing its pretty spot on. Yes it is a lot, but being sent it doesn&#039;t look big at all. Especially if their technique is the candle method. I think it would get through.<br /><br />Can anyone link me up with any other relevant cases?&nbsp; <br /><br />Or has anyone actually made a big order/any order internationally into aus and had it arrive okay??<br /><br />And i dont see how It could come back to me even if it was to get intercepted? seeing as its extremely hard to track ppl using sr.<br /><br />Thanks

I have no idea why you think they would. You are either incredibly naive or stupid. It doesn&#039;t seem that you comprehend the magnitude of what you are trying to do. If you get caught importing that amount of drugs to someone elses address you will get many years in prison.<br /><br />What are you going to do if the package is watched? How are you going to identify where you are being watched from? Are you getting the package by yourself or with a friend? How much do you trust them? If with a friend, who is going to take physical posession of the package when you pick it up? If you get a slip from the post office that an item is waiting, who is going to pick it up? Have you organised a way to even be able to pick the package up? How many days are you prepared to visit the address before assuming the package was lost?<br /><br />Have you considerded any of this?<br /><br />We keep answering how the package can be tied back to you. It&#039;s because at some point you will take posession of it and at that point it is yours. It is incredibly easy for the AFP to catch you. You aren&#039;t smarter than them, you are just hoping that the amount you order is less than an amount they will care to properly investigate.<br /><br />In answer to your original question, is it a bad decision, yes<br />Is it worth the risk, no

You buy a small 1 or 2 gram order. It gets sent, makes it through customs, and then you buy a large order which never arrives because of &quot;tough customs.&quot; Doing this also means that you will have to use your address twice instead of once.<br /><br />The amount of effort that needs to go into stealthing a 1 gram order is completely different from a 28 gram order. Not to mention the added attention that a larger order brings from LE if it is intercepted. Even some of MDUK&#039;s packages, which were meant to have been the best, were probably taken recently. It seems that customs has caught onto the use of MBBs into Australia.

				Australian law states that anything over .75gs of MDMA is considered an offence - the higher you go, the more extreme the offence.<br />28gs of MDMA is a dealer&#039;s quantity. The fact that youre ordering to an empty house is good.<br />You can go ahead and order but you have to accept the fact that you might never be able to get it<br />You have to ensure no one is watching your house<br /><br />If drugs are intercepted by customs - small amounts are simply confiscated<br />Large amounts (ounce of MDMA is a shitload - almost on par with cocaine and heroin) lead to an investigation<br />If you are caught - the repercussions will be severe - 100% jail time.<br />

				the poilce may confiscate it and try and find the name<br />OR more usually allow it to arrive at the address (or even better for them - the local post office)<br />and then you are fucked.<br />Plus if it arrives to the post office you need to provide ID - if its a fake name - you won&#039;t be able to get it<br />IF YOU EVER BUY - make sure there&#039;s no signature required<br />I would highly recommend against it but in the end its your $$$ - know the risks.<br /><br />hope this helps

He will go to jail importing that amount. It is a marketable quantity and every marketable quantity that is prosecuted ends with a prison term of at least two years. When you throw in the additional charge of interrupting the mail supply (max sentence 10 years) it will probably be even longer.<br /><br />You are exactly right though, it is not worth 5k, whichever way you look at it.

				Is this all drugs or just specifically MDMA?<br />I don&#039;t know the specifics for mdma but I know quite a few other drug cases (shrooms and ketamine) whereby offenders got away with marketable quantities due to an early guilty plea, etc.<br />But MDMA is like a level below coke/heroin (which is the only offence other than killing a cop that can lead to an non-parole LIFE sentence) so you&#039;re probably right.<br />Not worth 5K buddy - permanent record, black mark.<br />Go big or go home - 50K!<br />nah man probs dont risk it

				What mbius298074 said.<br /><br />Australian law (different in different states) has very low threshold quantities for MDMA, as mentioned above, as low as 0.5 grams. Amounts above this can be considered trafficking without other evidence of selling, therefore attracting a higher penalty.<br /><br />If I were you, my concern would be if the package was identified by customs through their routine checking of imported packages (yes, they do profiling for Silk Road packaging, though that won&#039;t capture all of them), they would allow it to arrive then have the empty house under surveillance through AFP. The only link between you and the package is your attempts to pick it up from the house or from the post office. <br /><br />In the end the success of Silk Road is about small packages coming in that are harder to distinguish from standard letters... because to check every letter would be impossible. But the bigger the package, the bigger the risk it will be checked. <br /><br />However, if you did this and the package got through Customs checking, I don&#039;t see how there is much evidence linking you to the package (assuming there are no other in-person mistakes that you and your friends make that lead LE straight to you...). Guess it depends on how much you are prepared to lose if things go wrong!

				Australia is a hot country.&nbsp; Seems like le are actually looking for shit coming in there.&nbsp; I&#039;d say be extra careful and watch out for surveillance on the package.&nbsp; They could watch and see where it goes too.&nbsp; If you have an elf, use them to get the package.

				Im not posting pics,<br />However I will offer some advice. Make sure you find and communicate with the vendor of 90 or 100% feedback. I spoke to mine for a little over a week before placing the order.<br />I also made sure the candle method was used as a stealth package. Which it totally works by the way. <br />14 grams might sound like alot, but when its in your hands it doesnt look like much at all.<br />I recieved my package on friday in my mailbox and have had no problems<br />
