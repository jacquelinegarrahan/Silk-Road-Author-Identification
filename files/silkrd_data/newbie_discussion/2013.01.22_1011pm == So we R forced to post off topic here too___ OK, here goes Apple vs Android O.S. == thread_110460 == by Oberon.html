				The iphone and IOS are nice products, but I think Android is a better platform. One thing Apple does well is engineering quality products, but I dislike the way the company operates in general. Fucking patent trolls drive me nuts, no matter what industry.

				Apple.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used both, and Android was fine, and I can see why people like it, but when it comes to just doing what I want my smartphone to do:<br />Send/receive texts, play my music, show me how to get places, check my email, show me good places to eat and help me cheat at trivia....<br />vs. I guess having to create some custom solution, root my shit and so on...<br />Apple just does what I want.&nbsp; <br /><br />50!

				Android! I really do not like the direction Apple is going in. Plus, I have friends whose iphones shattered in their pocket when they messed up a trick, and others whose androids have survived worse mistakes perfectly intact. <br /><br />I believe Apple is currently looking at its manufacturing as more flash than actual quality. It is basically the phone of the stereotypical foppish aristocrat, not a working mans phone.<br /><br />At least, that is how it seems to me from my experiences.
