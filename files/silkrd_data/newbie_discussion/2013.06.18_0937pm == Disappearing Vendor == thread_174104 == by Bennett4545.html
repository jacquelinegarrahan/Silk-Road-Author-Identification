				I placed a small order with a &quot;reputable&quot; vendor (Duck Commander).&nbsp; After reading through the forums, I sent him a message asking to cancel before he finished processing, as I was not going to FE as requested.&nbsp; He told me that escrow was cool, so I am now waiting on my package.&nbsp; I don&#039;t expect it for a couple of days.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />In the meantime, Duck Commander seems to have disappeared from SR.&nbsp; He no longer has a vendor page, and searching for him only takes me to the message thread I have with him.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not that concerned since I did not FE, but I have never seen a vendor disappear in the middle of a transaction like that!?!&nbsp; Is there any way to see if anyone else is getting their orders from Duck Commander?<br /><br />

				Not sure how you&#039;re doing your search, but DC&#039;s vendor page is live and well:<br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/messages/send_message/4d888769d7<br /><br />I&#039;m a fan of DC, have had multiple transactions with him, and all were delivered on time and with great stealth.<br />

				MedicineWoman,&nbsp; you&#039;ll notice that is a link to a message dialog.&nbsp; That&#039;s all Ive been able to get.<br /><br />I am not a &quot;fan&quot; of DC, and we talked by message last night.&nbsp; I think he must be in stealth or vacation mode, and I just can&#039;t get to his page now.&nbsp;

				Give him a little bit more time, not like you hit FE. Good info for me though, I need to make sure I become a fan of my favorite vendors.

				This is weird.&nbsp; I got my package today.&nbsp; Duck Commander certainly didn&#039;t scam me.&nbsp; I finalized immediately.&nbsp; <br /><br />I asked him where his listings had gone.&nbsp; He told me that SR admin had &quot;pulled&quot; his account? I guess too many people had called him out for requiring FE or selling BTC through western union?&nbsp; I figure that must be against the rules.&nbsp; <br />
