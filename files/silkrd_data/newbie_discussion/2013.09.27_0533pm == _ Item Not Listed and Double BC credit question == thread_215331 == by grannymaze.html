				Hi, total newb here. <br /><br />quick questions. <br /><br />At about 6amET i put a product in my cart. 2 hours later I made the bank deposit and my BC were in my account. I went to my shopping cart, placed and paid for the order and now the vendor&#039;s links to all quantities of their products say &quot;Item Not Listed&quot;. Did I just have shit luck and they were out of stock and pulled the listing in that window when i went to the bank? am waiting for a likely refund/order cancel? or should i be concerned? I sent vendor a message and got no reply. I&#039;m traveling Tuesday next week and paid for Express. <br /><br />Is this common on TSR? vendor seems very reputable. ayeseadee1080 is the vendor.<br /><br />second, a third part BC exchange sent me the funds twice and have asked i return them to the same address. i am going to return them, but if i was a scuzball would they be fucked?<br /><br />tia

				The person you purchased from couldve gotten banned for scamming, also if vendors dont check in every 2 days their listings are removed and their account becomes in active. Maybe the vendor just hasnt logged on for a few days?

				I had to reply as Ayeseadee1080 is one of the top vendors on the road. He is my go to guy and has never let me down.<br /><br />First, not a good idea to put items in your cart until you are ready to purchase (btc already in your account) as things can change while you&#039;re waiting for your deposit to go through. What usually happens is the item you put in your cart is still fair game for someone else until you place the order and if the item is in your cart and it&#039;s the last one then they get it because they are ordering now. <br /><br />Second, ayeseadee1080 is probably the most honest guy on SR. He was my very first vendor because when I sent out PMs looking for help as a newbie he was the only one who replied who wasn&#039;t rude or sarcastic. Walked me through the process, answered all my questions and took my order (my very first SR order) without making me FE. When delivery was delayed because of USPS I PM&#039;d him and he immediately tracked the package and gave me it&#039;s location and status. He has rave reviews going back his start on SR a long time ago. If I had to pick one vendor on SR for trust it would be him.<br />If it says &quot;No active listings&quot; on his profile page that means something has happened and he had to go somewhere or do something and he has taken down his listings so orders don&#039;t come in and sit around waiting for processing.&nbsp; I just looked at his profile page and that is the situation. There must have been an emergency. He will get back to you as soon as he gets back I&#039;m sure. Don&#039;t worry you didn&#039;t get ripped.<br /><br />Yes the exchange vendor who paid you twice would be out of luck if you chose not to return the second payment. But you don&#039;t want to start out on SR by getting a rep as a scuzball. You should return the payment and keep everything in balance. For the most part we look out for each other here, that&#039;s part of the reason for the forums. Do the right thing. (who was the exchange vendor?)

				Thanks all.<br /><br />Happy to say my order just converted to In Transit.<br /><br />The BC were bought through a non SR related entity. I would never keep the coins. I&#039;m an old fart and still believe karma will fuck you hard. I&#039;m just waiting from them for an account number.<br /><br />Peace

				Other than the bump this follow-up created, I am sure this thread will sink into oblivion. However, if anyone searches and finds it, I wanted to tie up the loose ends. That&#039;s easiest done, I think, by simply pasting the review I just left the vendor...<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />I am actually speechless. This was my virgin order on the road. 2 hours after I ordered it, it went to &quot;In Transit&quot;, 23 hours after that was 15 minutes ago. Right now I am loving the drip from the massive Glacier the nice Postman handed to me. So, 25 hours from &quot;Submit&quot; to Snort.<br /><br />I was the first of my friends to do the online thing with AOL 18 or so years ago, but the last of all of us to embrace the confidence of using this internet thingy to score. What a fucking douchebag I was. ALL the sketchy motherfucking, in-person suppliers along with the changing faces and eternal waits in hot parking lots is history for me. Short sacks and constant peril *almost* made me give it up.<br /><br />For $10 more than I was paying I have a fat-ass slab of crystalline goodness and I never had to get off my couch.<br /><br />I have been an Amazon seller for 7 years and I did not expect the stealth to be so utterly brilliant. This stealth method could be nearly perfect in its totality. I base that on shipping nearly 200,000 items with my own hands. <br /><br />Plus, got a cool cave for the glacier.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; <br />Seller and other buyers from him know what I mean.<br />☻☻☻☻☻<br /><br />5 Happy faces<br /><br />★★★★★<br />5 Big Stars<br /><br />Many Thanks!!

I just wanted to add the vendors name again, Ayeseadee1080, as he is a model vendor. When you posted the original post I PM&#039;d him to say I was concerned something may have happened and got a response in a few minutes. He was otherwise occupied, as I suspected, and suspended his listings so orders wouldn&#039;t be coming in and not be processed immediately, which is how he handles all his orders. You cannot go wrong with this vendor. I tried almost every other C vendor after him (he was the 1st I used) and now after many wasted $ and a bunch of crap product I&#039;m going back to him b/c he is so solid. He will be my only C vendor from now on.
