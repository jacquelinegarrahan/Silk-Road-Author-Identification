				I hope im just being paranoid but when I log into tor it does not do the normal where it says your ip address appears to be 234654678. It is giving me a page cannot connect?? like when SR is down. I went ahead an reinstalled an it did same thing. So I tried to type in SR url and it came right up. Plus its like my computer has someone else trying to control it?? My mouse is standing still but the arrow keeps jumping all over the page. And this is the biggest mystery for all how in the hell would I have a silkroad url icon on my home screen just like you would have a folder with a picture in it but had silkroadvb5 you know the rest. i erased it before I could even examine it. im just a small buyer but still. Please if anyone know how any of this happened please tell me. im to scared to place a freaking order now.<br /><br />update as I was typing the mouse arrow quit moving around on it own. I have control over it. but still tripped out. any info would be much appreciated <br /><br />

				The same cannot connect occurred with me and my buddy today with our first time using tor. Eventually it got through to silk road after multiple refreshes.

				Not sure if this is even relevant but I had a SHIT LOAD of problems getting TOR to open up tonight. I deleted and reinstalled The TOR bundle twice. Got so frustrated I took the damn computer to the local Mcdonalds to make sure the ISP didn&#039;t put up a firewall. finally it came back to&nbsp; life and haven&#039;t had much problems since. As to the mouse movements ...... swap out the mouse and see if that doesn&#039;t take care of your problem especially if it is hard wired to your computer ..... meaning not wireless.

				update- I my computer started skipping pages like im hitting the back button.....then a message popped up that said you are not encrypted on the site any info can be seen by 3rd party if sent....or something along those lines.....I logged off asap....got back on tor an my address is different now like it should be. What the F was that message all about? it was at top of screen at main page of SR.<br />im going to chalk the icon up to accidently hitting ctrl + S<br /><br />how do I give the karma to people? StExo desires one +1 an so does the other people helping me out on this post.<br /><br />im using a wireless mouse.

				I was having the problem earlier today where the Tor project start page wouldn&#039;t load for me either.&nbsp; I was still able to get onto other urls, but that page just wouldn&#039;t connect.&nbsp; There is a Tor Browser Bundle update that came out in the last 24 hours, and upgrading to it got rid of the problem for me.
