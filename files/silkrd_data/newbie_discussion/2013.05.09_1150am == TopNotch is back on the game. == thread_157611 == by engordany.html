				My order was processing since last Thursday, marked in transit yesterday, just arrived today.<br />So relax if you r still waiting, he ll deliver.<br /><br />I see some guys moaning...<br />dude, it was a long weekend, sr has had problems, a thousand things could have gone wrong with his setup and this guy is not fucking McDonaldÂ´s.<br />So respect his reputation and give him a fucking break&quot;<br /><br />

				Read the threads dude, no one was really moaning and almost every one tipped him as the best uk#3 on the road. A few of us were in a panic but then were bound to be as it&#039;s not a lump of hash we&#039;re waiting for. I think those threads have done more good for TN than bad as its now quite clear if you want quality and speedy delivery ( when the road is not down) then TN is the vendor to use.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				no moaning huh?<br /><br />&quot;If a vendor says &quot; I don&#039;t have time for messages or is rude, then why in the hell are they even here?.. Come on its like any business...&nbsp; the customer comes first, Next time a vendor tells you that, please tell them you will take your money elsewhere. Cocky Grouchy vendors suck &quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ve sent TN a couple of PM&#039;s titled &#039;Genuine Question&#039; as I know he doesn&#039;t reply to normal PM&#039;s - however he hasn&#039;t even read them, let alone reply!<br /><br />&quot;Bit rude to be honest, it&#039;s not like we&#039;re dealing with weed here, it&#039;s H and people need to know what the fuck is going on. If I don&#039;t hear anything before I&#039;m able to cancel, then I will be cancelling and out of principle not buying from him again. It&#039;s not exactly hard to put a message on his vendors page explaining what&#039;s going on. In my opinion this is total lack of respect to his customers. I now have very little BTC because it&#039;s all wrapped up in these 2 transactions, so I&#039;m starting to get pissed off (as you can probably tell!!)&quot;<br /><br />&quot;For me TN has mugged us all off by not letting us know what&#039;s going on, I have confidence that TN&#039;s orders will be sent - but for me that&#039;s beside the point. We&#039;re dealing with Heroin here not Hash, the minimum he could have done is put an UPDATE on his profile: it takes 2 minutes FFS.He&#039;s not even reading, let alone replying to his PM&#039;s even though he&#039;s been on line for the last 2 days - for me that is horrendous customer service. I have 2 days till I can cancel, if it&#039;s in transit by then I&#039;ll take it, If not I&#039;m cancelling without doubt.<br />I&#039;ll only return as a customer if he offers a justifiable reason for this scenario - if it&#039;s simply &quot;Sorry guys I was bogged down with orders&quot; that wont cut it, as like I said it takes 2 minutes to update a vendor page.&quot;<br /><br />and on and on...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				You have picked out a couple of points from those threads and I say again if you read through the threads the sentiment is pretty good. most people there recognize that the road has had a few issues and the problems with processing are a knock on effect.&nbsp; Almost everyone was tipping their hat to TN for quality and timely delivery under normal circumstances. It is great that there is this forum where we can air our thoughts and for a business&nbsp; that kind of feedback is vital as you can change the way you run your business to suite your customers. I seriously doubt TN has taken offense to those threads as any other uk h users reading them will understand the issues caused by the roads down time and try ordering from him. Also there is not that much difference between McDonald&#039;s and vendors on the road. They supply products that customers need. If you don&#039;t like your burger or the customer service then you go to burger king. Likewise if you don&#039;t like the gear or the service you go to another vendor. That&#039;s business after all. I for one will be sticking with TN as I think the service and quality are A+ but that&#039;s just my opinion. Some may not agree but its a free market, yes.

I&#039;m holding a slight hope that maybe he&#039;s done the orders and hasn&#039;t had time to log in and mark shipped yet. Doubt it though. Fucking just want to sleep until it gets here. Spent all my last money on a big order from him.

I&#039;m thinking we may be in for a couple of days delay at most. I ordered Sunday morning, I&#039;m expecting (hoping) delivery by Wendesday, if not then I&#039;m going to have to go to a big issue seller and do what I hate doing.
