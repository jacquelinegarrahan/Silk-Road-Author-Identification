				If you get caught receiving drugs in the mail, would it carry the same penalty as if you bought it in person? Or would it be worse?

				You can get hit with another charge for abusing the mail system, which is a felony. I don&#039;t know how serious the charge is though.

				Just don&#039;t sign for anything that you aren&#039;t expecting to sign for and you won&#039;t have any problems. They can&#039;t prove you ordered the drugs as long as you take the proper precautions. (encrypt your address with pgp when ordering, only order from reputable vendors ect) If you buy domestic, the chances of any problems (package being seized) significantly decreases as your package doesn&#039;t have to go through customs. If your package does get seized, whether or not you get a controlled delivery will depend on the contents and the amount. If you are only ordering personal amounts, you have very little to worry about.<br /><br />Hope this helps, and good luck!

				Right, if you are paranoid, keep the letter/parcel unopened for a couple of days and write &quot;return&quot; on it. If LE comes up you can show them that you haven&#039;t opened it and wanted to return it to sender the next days as you have no idea what that is and you don&#039;t want to open it.
