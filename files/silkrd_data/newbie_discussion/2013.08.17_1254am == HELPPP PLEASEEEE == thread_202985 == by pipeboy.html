				You will have to wait a couple of hours for the BTC to appear in your SR wallet, if that is what you are asking.

				I think doing it this way is not very smart and could potentially get backtraced quite easily... because its unkown that sites like localbitcoins give out IPs of users or not, and if LE has access to their databases, so they may keep track of people sending BTC directly from their website to Silkroad.. <br /><br />The safest thing to do is mix your Bitcoins first when you transfer them on your SR account, you do this by opening a new Bitcoin address on blockchain.info, and then theres an option to mix btc... that way its alot harder to trace them back.. Have 2 account there, send BTC from localbitcoins to your new blockchain address, then use the mixer and send them to a 2nd blockchain adress. From there send them directly on your SR account. If you wanna cash BTC out, do the same thing.. register a new Bitcoin account, and send them to your main BTC account with the mixing option.<br /><br /><br />Mixing is basicly you send a certain amount of BTC out, and OTHER people would send you those bitcoins to your account.. so the Adress that sends them out is a different one that the one you actually used. This is also called a laundry service. Blockchain is the biggest of those mixers because most people use that, so the more people the safer basicly<br /><br /><br />You should still keep in mind that are transactions are public available and if they are using some sort of dataminer they could potentionally backtrace every transaction... So to be even more safe i would advice you to use amounts that most people use, such as 1 straight BTC and not 1.00305 BTC, since that amount would be suspicous

				When you get your new coins in the localbitcoins.com account, best to send them through a few wallet addresses to make sure they are clean, or recommend sending them through the bitcoinfog machine before funding your SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />To make identification more difficult for outsiders, you should not move the coins directly to SR from localbitcoins acct, it&#039;s best to practice the security and move them around asymetrically (move as odd amounts and fund SR from two addresses at minimum) as it will greatly guarantee your safety. <br /><br />Stay safe, and live longer.

Once the interested parties, be it authorities or just interested researchers (http://anonymity-in-bitcoin.blogspot.com/2011/07/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous.html) have acquired any one of your addresses or transactions, they could easily track your money around the network.<br /><br />And knowing your transaction history, connecting your bitcoin addresses to real you is possible, because you will at some point need to exchange your bitcoins to or from a fiat currency using a bank account number, a credit card, LR account or similar service which is much less anonymous than the bitcoin network.<br /><br />We are providing a solution for this: using our service you mix up your bitcoins in our own pool with other users&#039; bitcoins, and get paid back to other addresses from our mixed pool, which, if properly done by you can eliminate any chance of finding your payments and making it impossible to prove any connection between a deposit and a withdraw inside our service.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Keep in mind, this is NOT A MACHINE! Its not a PROGRAM! Those sites are managed by real people, and they COULD scam your whole wallet, since you give them YOUR btc.<br /><br /><br />The most importand thing here is that they mix the BTC in a pool with all the other users. Now that can only be secure if the pool is big enough. I dont know much about this website but im fairly sure Blockchain has a much higher pool then this site, and you can also access it by using Tor ( Wich i highly advice when creating new adresses)<br /><br />In short: Go with blockchain.info and if you want even higher security use other services aswell, but keep in mind that you always have to trust those persons if you give them your BTC ( all i can say is blockchain is 100% safe..)

				like i said dude, honestly.. better send them back again and mix them up... it may be hard for LE to track a seller down, but its quite easy to get his bitcoin adress. And if hes not hiding his funds its quite easy for them to track your btc adress, so they can atleast bust you. I would be very cautious especially if you buy harder drugs such as MDMA and not just cannabis. The amount you buy matters aswell.
