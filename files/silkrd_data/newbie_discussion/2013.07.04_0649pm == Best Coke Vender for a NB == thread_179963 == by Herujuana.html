				Hi!<br />The two coke vendors I&#039;ve dealt with are Blueberry91 and Licentia. Both are fantastic! Both have sent product within 24 hours. Product smooth, nice euphoric high, ALMOST no burning up the nose, easy come-down etc... That said, I just sent Licentia a message stating that his/her last batch was f&#039;ing awesome! Almost NO come-down... it was like it just faded. Amazing! Stealth efficient and NO need for concern. I would probably be better at writing a review for both, but considering I&#039;ve had quite a bit of alcohol today my writing ability is somewhat limited... at least at the moment. HA! :)&nbsp; Please message me... as I&#039;ll provide as much info as I can. The two vendors I mentioned... I absolutely LOVE! If they were actors I&#039;d give&#039;em Oscars... HA :)<br /><br />Ciao! <br />D~

				Thanks. Neither of them have listings. Probably because of the holiday. I already went ahead an placed an order with chaletla, so I&#039;ll let you know how that goes.

				Yes, please do. Always interested to know how transactions have gone with other vendors. I&#039;ve seen his/her listings, but have never placed an order.<br /><br />According to Licentia&#039;s profile he/she is on vacation cuz of the holiday. I&#039;m sure BB91 is on vacation as well. <br />

				On the top of my head, the absolute best quality to price ratio is Bungee54 or ItalianMafiabrussels - unfortunately they both have their listings down atm<br /><br />Sukey has 2 &quot;collections&quot; : the ultra-clean coke and the high quality coke. Even though both of them are in the top potency-wise, the difference in prize and quality is noticeable. They can be bought in order in the size of .25 grams - enough for a good night out or at home :) I do recommend to try it out at home without alcohol if its your first time<br /><br />These 3 have the best quality coke on SR, and what You should chose between, in my opinion.<br /><br />This comes from a 3 year casual coke user, IRL and online.<br /><br />Regards,<br />bluehorn

				i just split a gram of sukeys ultra clean high quality coke with 3 guys... I&#039;m not saying it was bad at all and i&#039;m not knocking on sukey, but i feel like it wasn&#039;t 83 plus percent . We started off with .05 lines and ended with about .08 lines. anybody else recently try his ultra clean high quality stuff? I think it was good( 7/10) but not worrth $185

				When I first started here on SR, I FE&#039;d for Northern Dancer for a half gram of coke.&nbsp; I got it literally 4 days after it was marked in transit.<br /><br />That was almost a year ago, and I still believe that ND is a good option for coke.
