				Anyone know what SuperTrips delivery time to the USA is looking like lately? I placed an order on May 11 and it was put in transit on the 15th. 21 days later and still hasn&#039;t arrived. Anyone know if this is common right now, or if my pack probably isn&#039;t coming. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks

				Yeah I saw a ton of people saying 8-16 days to the States but I&#039;m still a little hopeful. However I get a weird feeling this order is not going to show up. Hopefully he will resend because I would really love to try his products but if he wont resend then I cant place another order with him. Not worth the risk to me.

				i know....hoping that there is still something comming.<br />i wait for two orders from two diffrent vendors from nl since 4 day and both dosent show up.<br />so sometimes it can take longer and sometimes its super fast.<br />my longest time was 8 days from ger to ger or 6 days from nl to ger.ger to ger shouldn t take longer than 2 days....so still keep hoping that something will come but also tell supertrips your situation.<br />last year i order many packages from nl and many doesnt arrive but also no letter from le so i think they get lost :(<br />good luck and hoping for you that something comes the next days :)

				My SuperTrips delivery took 3 weeks to arrive in the UK. I&#039;ve no idea why it took so long. It was sent &#039;Priority&#039; but obviously not delivered in that way.<br /><br />Never had an order take so long before and still turn up.

				I messaged SuperTrips to try to find out what&#039;s going on cause its now been 22 days and my pack diidnt arrive today either. He said its still possible that it will come and he&#039;d give it til the end of the week. It just seems unlikely that if it hasn&#039;t come within 3 weeks I probably wont get it. Also I didn&#039;t get a customs love letter so I know customs didn&#039;t confiscate it. I&#039;m just hopeful that mine is coming cause someone on the east coast of USA just gt there pack after roughly 21 days and I&#039;m on the east coast as well. I&#039;m just dissappointed but hopefully SuperTrips will come through.

				i have had many order with ST and all have arrived to US in about 14 days. my last one, marked in transit 5/8, has NOT showed. i am in the process of trying to get a reship. there was some slow down at the beginning of the month in germany, which ST mentioned, but i would have expected mine by now. ST has been very responsive to my messages. reading some feedback it seems many people have been experiencing long delivery times. i think my order will not come as its been close to a month:(

				I&#039;m just skeptical that mine even got sent in the first place. Marked in transit on 5/14 and no sign and no love letter. I hope I am wrong but I don&#039;t think it even got sent. I think they tucked up cause it was quickly put in transit 1 hour before the cancel button became available.

				i can say this about ST: even when he had all the problems last year, he still managed to square things up with me and i was ordering small amounts. I do NOT think he&#039;s a scammer in any way. Like i said, many people have been experiencing long delivery times. i don&#039;t think he selectively didn&#039;t give you your package

				I don&#039;t think it was intentional. I just think they quickly put my order as in transit so I wouldn&#039;t cancel and I finalized within minutes so I think maybe my order was lost in the mix somewhere

				SuperTrips is fucking slow. I know that he has a lot of customers and all, but come on - If I order from c3amg or frankmatthews, the H is on it&#039;s way the next day. It is now the 3rd day of <br />me waiting for SuperTrips to send it. Didnt try the quality though, and that&#039;s what really matters. I&#039;ll save the judgment for when it comes

				Supertrips heroin #4 had no reaction on a reagent test meaning it is not heroin. Everyone says it packs a HUGE rush but the effects are gone within 2 hours which is consistent with fentanyl and its analogs. I cant say for sure what it is cause i havent gotten mine yet but if it has no reaction on a reagent test it does not contain any heroin. Other people are saying its heroin #3 labeled as Heroin #4 anyways I still bought it regardless of what people are saying because of how strong thy say it is. I just hope it comes soon car id love to try this stuff. I would really love someone to send in a sample for GC/MS testing so we can all get a positive ID of what the active opioid in this stuff is.

But fentatyl is much, much stronger than heroin. If it was pure fentatyl, people would die. So if what you say is indeed true, then it probably is a little fentatyl mixed with mdma. That would explain the rush. Are you really sure about there being no h in it?<br />

				People are sayingt that the reagent test had absolutely no reaction so t showed no trace of heroin. Fentanyl should have an orangish reaction and this stuff reacted clear. I&#039;m thinking its a fentany analog possibly. 3-Methylfentanyl which is typically the only opiate/opioid available in Estonia which is about 18 hours away from Germany. Again this is all speculation on my part based on wat many people are saying about this &quot;heroin&quot; because I still have not received my order. I just believe it is a fentanyk analog bescause the duration of effects are very consistent with fentanyl and its analogs

				Mela was supposed to say MDMA. I would think if its tent/mdma the mdma would have reacted on the test. I know customs can hold a package for a grip but just wanted to know if anyone has had 23-35 days in transit for supertrips.
