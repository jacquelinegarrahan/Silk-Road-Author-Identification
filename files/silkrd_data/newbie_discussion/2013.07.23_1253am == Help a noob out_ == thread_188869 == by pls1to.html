				Do just a little more reading, like here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide<br /><br />Then if something isn&#039;t crystal clear, come back. Different countries/regions have various options for you depending on your level of desired anonymity.

				PGP / GPG is really simple to use here<br /><br />To get BTC is a pain these days, I think lots of people go to localbitcoin or pay someone with a green dot credit card ....&nbsp; But in USA the government is trying really hard to make BTC difficult or impossible to exchange.

				Use localbitcoins or https://bitbargain.co.uk/ if you&#039;re in the UK.<br /><br />With localbitcoins you can buy with cash anonymously from your local area.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />
