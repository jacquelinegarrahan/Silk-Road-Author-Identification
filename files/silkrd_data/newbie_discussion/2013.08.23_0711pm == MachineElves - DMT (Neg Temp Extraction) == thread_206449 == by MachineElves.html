				am i crazy if i smoked dmt and then questioned everything i ever thought i knew about life and this world. i believe in aliens now after they had me strapped to their surgery table and probed my brain and i could feel the probes poking the innermost parts of my brain, they had their own language and i couldnt understand them, i begged for them to stop, and i wanted a fun trip, and that world disappeared, into a crazy dimension we were in sheets of mirrors falling and shattering only into another mirror , me watching Asian girls dancing, while our glass world shattered into another. they partied all night with me, and right before they left they threw all these drugs ive been doing lately (mostly MDMA) at me and they turned into toxic liquid and&nbsp; did a bunch of crazy stuff i cant really explian. then i came back to earth.<br />

				i have had countless breakthroughs with dmt. i have done it many many times. i could go on and on with details of my experiences instead i will say overall dmt has changed my life for the positive. i am extremely comfortable with death .&nbsp; i feel as if dmt proved there is an afterlife and higher powers this is no longer theory to me. we all just move on from here.&nbsp; it also helped me with anxiety issues i had and more...&nbsp; i am so thankful i did not miss out on dmt
