BE WARNED its the most vial thing you&#039;ve shoved down your throat... unless you like to eat dog shit regularly lol

I have seen it in the purple micro dot form on sir but when I decided on my first purchase it was gone and I haven&#039;t seen it since, I can&#039;t remember what the actual price was but I think it was around 10 dollars. far cry from back in the day when I got 100 for 65 dollars. I do miss the dots.

				I have had San Pedro tea from some weak stock and only had threshold effects. Tea from a 12 inch bridgesii sent me into outer space. It was a very enjoyable experience after I got past the nausea. I heard that mescaline hcl doesn&#039;t cause the nausea and vomiting like cactus tea. I am a little surprised that no one is offering it because tricocereus cacti are legal and readily available. I know the cost of extracting would make the final product far more expensive than most RCs but I think it would be worth it. People have been using mescaline cacti for thousands of years. God only knows what most of these RCs will do
