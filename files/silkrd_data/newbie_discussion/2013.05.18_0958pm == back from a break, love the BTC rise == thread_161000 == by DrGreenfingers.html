				Four weeks ago it was at £100 ($150) a coin. Then came the DDOS attacks and it fell back to £60 ($90) odd. Been at £70 for a while before creeping up to £80 these last couple of days.<br /><br />Was really exciting before the crash though. I had 5BTC in a wallet and for a couple of weeks I was earning over £100 a day on it. I was literally making more money just by holding a few coins than I was by going to work each day!<br /><br />Told the missus that if it carried on at the same rate Bitcoin would be taking us to Disneyland! But she didn&#039;t believe they were real. She was adamant they were all part of some online fantasy game. Managed to convince her in the end. But then came the infamous crash.
