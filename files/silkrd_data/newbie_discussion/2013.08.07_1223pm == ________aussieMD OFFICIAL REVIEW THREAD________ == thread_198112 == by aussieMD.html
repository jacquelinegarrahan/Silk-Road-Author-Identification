				Helloo<br /><br />Bought MDMA from several vendors across SR and atlantis in the last couple of weeks and this is by far the best quality I have received, so much that I am making a forum account to review it.<br /><br />I bought as much as possible earlier in the week and it came in the most ridiculous stealth I&#039;ve seen so far and included an extra 200mg sample.<br /><br />As for the appearance, nice slightly off white color with massive crystals. I&#039;m talking 3/4 gram rocks.<br />Next order I am going to get out my geology field kit and classify the grain sizes, I was very impressed.<br />I&#039;ve had a blocked nose so I couldnt comment on the smell but it had that stinky chemical taste you know is going to be half decent.<br /><br />Anyways, for further testing it just happened that I had ordered a couple of marquis tests from another vendor that arrived the same day. straight through to dark purple in a matter of seconds. I&#039;ll make sure to upload photos on the next order.<br /><br />Through to eating the shit.<br />My mate had a party on the saturday, so naturally that was testing time. Split it up so that a group of us (around 14 people) all had some of varying quantities. I only had 3 caps (100mg, 100mg &amp; 180mg) and first dosed at 9pm when I was about to finish work.<br /><br />0000:&nbsp; &nbsp;100mg cap. about to leave work<br />+0030:&nbsp; &nbsp;still at work, had to stay back, getting a bit chatty. feeling slight come up<br />+0100:&nbsp; &nbsp;arrived at party, feeling really good. much better than I did before I took the cap<br />+0130:&nbsp; &nbsp;had a couple of drinks, ran into my brother who was sober, decided to split a line 50/50<br />+0200:&nbsp; &nbsp;fuck yes. having a fucking awesome time. smoking blunts and raving <br />+0400:&nbsp; &nbsp;still peaking so hard, pupils the size of the moon, talking to everyone about everything<br />+0500:&nbsp; &nbsp;made a gazillion new friends, everyone in the sample group is fucked off their minds high.&nbsp; <br />+0600:&nbsp; &nbsp;its about 3am. party is still kicking, am really fucked up good but decide to do another cap&nbsp; anyways.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- split the 180mg cap into 4 little lines and remember that I have work tomorrow at 3pm.<br />+0700:&nbsp; I am so high. so so high<br />+1000:&nbsp; Arrived home, high as fuck but smoked enough cones that I think I can sleep. go to bed<br /><br />had an alright sleep, kept waking up and dancing round in my bed but other than that it was sweet. woke up about 1pm so +16 hours after first dose and +8 hours after last dosage feeling not too scattered compared to what could have been.<br /><br />how I rate it: <br />The last time I did MDMA was a few weeks back at a 3 day music festival in northern nsw and that weekend personally took about 2.5g of a different sellers stuff over 3 days mostly insulfating and I was pretty fucked up. That was great mdma however if I had the option to choose between that stuff and AussieMD&#039;s stuff back then, even though Aussie&#039;s gear is more expensive, I would choose his product. Its much nicer and a better quality.<br />This was agreed by all people who tried both batches.<br /><br />As I said, I will be buying more and I am happy to upload pictures next time as I didn&#039;t even think of it back then.<br /><br />Regards<br />The1122112<br /><br />

				If people are wondering about the processing time for this vendor, I am very happy to report that I placed an order approx 2 hours ago and it has already been marked as in transit! Hopefully that means it will go in today&#039;s mail. <br /><br />I live a regional area where express post usually takes 2 days to arrive, so I am very impressed that it has been processed on the same day I placed the order. <br /><br />I will be sure to update this with feedback on arrival time, stealth and product review - but so far I am very happy with vendor!!

				Hi folks,<br /><br />Have ordered twice from aussieMD now. Pending stock availability, I have no reason to go elsewhere for MDMA. <br /><br />My first order arrived in 2 days and was overweight by 0.2. Stealth was great, the most professional I&#039;ve seen so far. Product was a nice brown colour and the vast majority of it was little rocks. I capped it up in .120 dosages, the first one i had got my buzz on but didn&#039;t quite get me where I wanted to be, so I had another and was proper buckled. Was a nice clean high with good waves of euphoria, not as smacky as MDMA can be (I didn&#039;t have to sit down and ride out the waves) which was good. Ended up eating 4 caps over the night, punched a few billy&#039;s before bed and had no trouble sleeping. Was a touch scat in the morning, but it wore off pretty quick and was only a bit tired come afternoon. <br /><br />My second order just arrived today, I was a little concerned because It hadn&#039;t come as quick as my first order. I sent some messages to aussieMD who was always quick to reply, apologetic of any delays and kept me up to date with the tracking. Turned out I put the wrong postcode down. Am very appreciative of the communication during the second order, was a great relief when it turned up, but I never really had any doubt. Just weighed the order and was overweight again, this time by 0.3, can&#039;t wait to get stuck in this weekend.<br /><br />Have only made a few order on Silk Road, it&#039;s definitely easier and cheaper than going through my previous dealer. aussieMD has been most reliable so I have no reason to go elsewhere.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Fingerbang
