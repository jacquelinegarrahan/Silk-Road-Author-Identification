				I am trying to become a seller. Problem is I have no money, which is why I wish to sell here. Now the issue is the fact that I need over 4 BTC to bond in order to sell, I can&#039;t afford that at all. I have very little money and would need about $500 in order to place up for bond. Is there any other possible way to work around this. I am in desperate need to be able to sell on here and would appreciate if anyone can tell me what is possible to do.

				Sorry, there is no way &quot;to work around&quot; the vendor bond.&nbsp; It is required.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing you may want to think about is if you can&#039;t afford the vendor bond (which is later refunded) then how will you be able to afford to keep your product in stock, and how will you be able to afford the necessary supplies for processing and shipping orders discreetly/safely?

				Shipping materials and methods are not an issue at all. They also are way less than 500 dollars. As far as supply of product, I&#039;d rather not go into details but some product is not a constant and other product is pretty easy for me to get without worry of price or trouble of getting what will be sold. I am not planning on making a full blown living off of the site, but do have an occasional chance to sell wares of different sorts, and going through silk road and using bitcoin is the easiest route for my success while minimizing my chances of getting in trouble. I would love to be able to work with them in some sort of way, maybe have my first couple of sales witheld until the buyer provides good feedback or anything like that just to prove this is not any type of scam or anything. I have ways to get things done without having to use money, through barter and trade usually, this is why money is an issue here.

				That is a notion easier said than done. Problem is to getting the initial money. I don&#039;t have money that is the root of the problem. If I had cash I would have used it for here by now, I know I can make money once started, but in order to do that I need the money to get started. This is the reason trade and barter have been such a huge part of everything I do. It&#039;s easier to get people to part with things they don&#039;t use too much in trade for something they do want, and be able to turn that around to get something you want. Trying to get people to part with their cash however is more of a challenge. If I could barter than sell what I get that would be easier but the whole selling thing is more of a challenge, as I said people are happy to part with items, not cash. This is the problem I am stuck with and have been stuck with. I&#039;ve been looking into selling for a while and have tried to figure out a way to build up that capital, but every bit of cash I get in has to go right out. So being able to spare that is the issue in which I can not find my way around, I have even asked a few people I know if I could borrow the money for a few weeks and they would get it right back but none of them can do so, I&#039;ve even offered interest with it but just keep spinnin my wheels.

				maybe I would let you know how I am able to come about what I get if I actually knew you, I do not have the leisure of giving away how I can do what I do. I have what I have and can sell what I have. It is not always a constant, but I do have my ways. So everyone has their secrets as you have yours I am sure. I do not freely give secrets, I am not asking for anything but help from the people who run SR. Maybe some sort of work around, an extra hold with them after escrow, waiting until true confirmation from buyers that the product is on the up and up. Whatever means to prove I am someone who can be trusted.&nbsp; I assure you everything I have to sell is real product in a few different categories, my issue is the bond and that is it.

				I suggest starting on the other marketplaces (BMR and Atlantis) until you have made enough profit to join Silk Road as a vendor. You&#039;ll get your bond back after being a member for 6 weeks and selling $1,500 of product so if you have a supplier who trusts you then maybe you could extend your credit to include this $500.<br /><br />You could also sell some stuff on Bitmit until you have the coins, or work for Bitcoins in other ways until you have the funds. Use your imagination, that&#039;s what I intend to do.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Bud, one word of advice, the more desperate you look to your friends and the people you are asking to borrow you money, the more it puts them off,&nbsp; I can appreciate you want to come and provide a service and maybe make some bucks, but its not the right way to start in this manner. Without some funds and due diligence you are likely to jeopardize your security and expose potential buyers.<br /><br /><br />P.S. If you really want to get some money from your friends, don&#039;t offer things like interest and all this, just stress out to them it would be a favor and you will remember what a good gesture they did. And most of all play it cool, like you want it but you don&#039;t really need it, cos then people might think they will either wait a long time for their money or never get it. This advice might a good chance of working on people which you havent asked already.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Seriously fella...get out and do some labour and earn some extra if you don&#039;t have it!...work at McDonalds or on a building site for minimum wage if necessary...<br /><br />As others said, how would you buy product to sell without working capital? It&#039;s daft to try to get involved without a decent pot to set a bond (quite correct of SR to set a bar - AT LEAST THIS HIGH....I think it should be more personally....) and then to buy all the correct stealth equipment (God knows how you intend to send your product??...I shudder to imagine the lack of planning and poor execution...but please tell me I&#039;m mistaken and you have suitable expertise and equipment and I&#039;ll take that back!) and then purchase quality product to sell at a reasonable mark up to our community...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know pal, it just seems like you need to go out and save some cash and come in next year when you have it all nicely sorted...the problem with borrowing and sounding desperate is that you put yourself and others at risk in my experience.<br /><br />But good luck...go find a second or third job to save your cash up :)<br /><br />Doc
