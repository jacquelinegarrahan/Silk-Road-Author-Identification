				shrooms...... I got a half ounce of her mushrooms and man let me tell you..... even though they were kind of small.... they packed a FULL PUNCH!<br /><br />I have noticed that sometimes the smaller the mushroom the more potent they are....&nbsp; first I ate just 1.7 grams to try them out.&nbsp; I had full on breathing floors and walls... trippy visuals.... very nice...<br /><br />so a bit later in the day I ate maybe 3-4 grams.... WOW boys and girls... I had a full on Psychedelic trip on my hands... I had auditory distortions, visual distortions... color changes, warping of shapes,&nbsp; YOU name it and it was happening!&nbsp; I was seeing Geometric patterns in the pictures I was looking at......And had the biggest laughing fit I have had in years.... tears of joy and laughter was intense....<br /><br />so a big THANK YOU to mushroom girl and her organic greenhouse shrooms.... give her a go folks<br /><br />mm &amp; sn

				For sure. I purchased a quarter from her a while back and was thoroughly impressed. From her communication, shipping, stealth, to the potency of the caps. Would definitely recommend!
