				Hi all,<br /><br />Trying to get to Tor Mail today but it appears to be down/unreachable to me.&nbsp; Anyone else having the same problem?&nbsp; Is this to be regularly expected from Tor Mail or am I doing it wrong?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Mr uP.

				I am also new to Tormail.&nbsp; I had no problems setting up the email account; it was getting in to check it or see if I had any mail!&nbsp; Disabling my firewall seems to be the trick as I&#039;ve been getting in on every try in the past few days.&nbsp; I set up a second Tormail account and sent a test email, just to make sure my messages were going through and such.&nbsp; Everything&#039;s cool now.&nbsp; Let me know how it goes.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />angelicruin

				It always seems to be hit or miss for me. I either get right in or it just doesn&#039;t load no matter how many times I try. Flaky at best.

				Tormail.org is pretty flakey as far as connection goes...<br /><br />Try changing your Identity(IP) and reconnecting.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s a simple error in the proxy you&#039;re using, like one of those phantom IPs from the middle of the Ocean?&nbsp; Sometimes Tor sites struggle to establish a connection with the entirely fake IPs. <br /><br />Otherwise, their servers are constantly being attacked I&#039;m sure. Secrecy comes at a price.<br /><br />Always use encryption regardless.

				<br />It seems necessary to have a backup email. <br /><br />There are ways to cope if you prepare for the worst.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />TM should be reopened soon enough. Meanwhile get your backup set up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Life is one adjustment after another&nbsp; :)
