				in north america i dont see many domestic vendors with prices low enough to make any money<br />i find the prices on SR are high. everything is at the top of the price scale for each drug. i would have to sell the drugs for crazy high amounts to make it worth the risk.<br />i have seen some good prices internationally where you could make some good money but i dont think i would take the risk buying bulk internationally.<br />i think it makes more sense to buy on the street and sell it for top dollar on SR<br />

				I know people who use silkroad to resell but they use it accordingly to make the money to restock from other countries instead of paying higher price for shitter quality drug then you can get imported.<br /><br />I am from australia though so obviously we have massive street value for drugs compared to the rest of the world.<br /><br />

				I plan to start doing just that. I will let you guys know. And from the prices I&#039;ve seen and as mentioned above.. If you order Domestic in the US specifically for resale on the streets then you are losing money. I am currently waiting for a shipment of 1/2 ounce of shrooms from MushroonMafia, 1 gram MDMA from TomorrowMan, 50 tabs of 25I-nBOME from Righteous and 5x 20mg&nbsp; AMT from j1m1th1ng, all of which I have estimated will make around $570.00.<br /><br />I am also planning on reviewing Mr. Charlie Sheen&#039;s FishScale Cocaine (1/4gram free sample) when It arrives, So I will be sure to post how good his Coke is.<br /><br />And I purchased a sample of 100mg of MXE as well as 250mg of 5F-UR-144 from FiberOptic and will make a thread to let you all know how that goes :)<br /><br />I feel there is certainly Ca$h to be made here if you get the balls to do it right and carefully.

				if you have the balls to go international you can make good cash<br />supertrips sells 10g of h for 850. where i live its very hard to get and cut to a level that is almost humorous. could easily chop that up and sell it for 2300 to 3000 depending on the amounts being sold<br />thats without cutting it.

				@RobLoblaw, please dont cut it&nbsp; :P just saying. As to the OP, i have and continue to resell domestic NBOMe from Righteous and T5, Great vendors and huge margin for profit. Domestic MDMA is a joke, but i am currently investing into spaced semi-bulk packages from EU of pure moon rocks, To then Gel Cap and resell here. Good profit margins with this CRAZY demand for it but definitely feeling the risk with those shipments! Overall SR really is a good place to try new stuff, or distribute whatever you have locally as a vendor, But not really a good place for supply and resale in the long run. Start making some connections domestically through SR or IRL and then you can start seeing some real stacks!

				Here in uk i find some prices are high but the quality is much above street gear here, i have also seen domestic vendors selling on better stuff than the street but also way above street prices,i find meds go for max street price right through, like £1 for each diazepam to&nbsp; £100 the 100 diazepam but dont need to deal with users etc so this is why i think u pay more, better service and quality than u would get on the street, i personally find paying a bit extra for better stuff is much the same as paying for double off street as quality half as good.

				Where I live when it comes to weed, you really have 2 options: either reg or kill shit. And it always varies. It&#039;s not like you have a choice of different types of kill, you get what they have. <br /><br />On average, kill goes for $110-$120 qtr. I must say though, I only have a small network to suppliers here, so is it possible there are lower prices? Yes. However, we aren&#039;t anywhere near a MM state to bring those prices down a bit. <br /><br />That being said, I just ordered a 1/2 of some purple haze for $185 on SR. That would have cost me an average of $230-$240 here, so I am looking at about a $50 or so savings on a 1/2. I saw some good shit on SR for $200/oz, which could easily be re-sold here at $100/qt all day long, getting a 50% ROI on it. <br /><br />However, that being said, I don&#039;t want the risk involved. Would it be a good investment? Absolutely. But having to order continually to my address and in large amounts and then the risks that come along with being a &quot;physical dealer&quot;? Fuck that. I want to smoke weed...not sling it and risk spending years in prison for trafficking. <br /><br />Only exception may be is if I am ordering something for myself and a buddy or something wants to go in half, but that&#039;s it. <br /><br />Best of luck if you decide to go that route, and make sure you have a safety plan full of redundancies &quot;just in case&quot;.

				You could be an evil bastard and sell &#039;TechnoHippie&#039;s&#039; DOB blotter tabs of as acid. He&#039;s selling them as 0.01 per tab. So sell them say £5 a tab then there&#039;s some good profit in there. It&#039;s just a matter of the morale obligations as an unsuspected acid seeker launched into a 18 hour DOB trip is not a pretty sight.

				Personally the only way I think it would be worth your while is if you get something that no one else has in your area that you can sell really high. Pretty hard to be the only person around if you live near a decent sized city though.

				The prices for weed are ridiculously high on SR, around here, i pay $10/g for top shelf stuff and $5/g for decent stuff, i don&#039;t get why it&#039;s that pricey.. but i just ordered some Super Silver Haze out of curiosity.<br /><br />But there&#039;s a lot of money to make from ketamine in my town, it usually goes for $80/g, i sell it $50/g to my usual dealer, so i don&#039;t even deal with end-users. When i order 10g it&#039;s out within 4-5 days.<br /><br />Other than that, i just received some LSD at $5/tab that i can resell very easily at $10 if not $15 each. And i also stock on local-bought yummy fishscale Cocaine, 2C-B and Xanax for my friends who want to get high, because all you can get around here is pot, speed, heavily cut coke, pharmaceutical opiates and Mushrooms if you&#039;re lucky.<br /><br />Also, why are you guys scared of international orders? i&#039;m from canada and 11 of my 12 orders came from Europe fast and without any trouble while my only order from the USA never arrived and the re-ship either. No letter from the customs, though.

				I have no practical experience on buying from SR but I would suggest that there is no reason to buy off SR and sell on the street unless #1, #4, or #5. If either 1 or 4 are true then 2 and 3 apply. <br /><br />1) you have a network already (starting a new business can be a difficult, dangerous, and unforgiving endeavor)<br />2) the product on SR is far superior (talking Ferrari to a Suzuki swift.)<br />3) the product on SR is one that is not locally available/ exceptionally rare.<br />4) you are in a remote location without competition.<br />5) you can successfully perform a hostile takeover.<br /><br />just my thoughts.
