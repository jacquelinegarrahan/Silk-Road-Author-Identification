				So this weekend me and my girlfriend are taking MDMA.&nbsp; I have taken it once before and she has never done it.&nbsp; Last time I tried it I took about 130mg by parachuting and didn&#039;t feel that much different at all.&nbsp; I had bought the MDMA off the road from a trusted vendor and they told me I should take much more like .25 or up.&nbsp; I weigh about 185 pounds.&nbsp; According to the 1.5mg/kg rule 130mg would be a fine dose but I didn&#039;t feel much.&nbsp; My plan this weekend would be to take more like 250mg or even 300mg parachuting again and I was wondering what others felt about this dose.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.<br /><br />Also my girlfriend weighs less than me obviously but I&#039;m not exactly sure how much.&nbsp; She is not an experienced drug user but wants to try MDMA.&nbsp; Because of her inexperience a super intense roll may not be the best idea.&nbsp; What might be a good dose for a 5&#039;9&#039;&#039; girl who is pretty skinny.

				could be a matter of purity<br /><br />i&#039;ve done lots of mdma, as in many times and (sometimes) in large quantities. if it&#039;s pure and unadulterated, you could easily take half a gram or more over the course of a night (i would not recommend doing that with pills unless you are 100% positive they contain no other agents because that&#039;s how you OD on random things you never intended on taking).<br /><br />if you didn&#039;t feel 130mg your first time, either you didn&#039;t measure it properly, or it&#039;s not very pure, or it could simply be a matter of mdma not being very effective for your chemistry. mdma works by releasing the seratonin already in your brain, and certain medications and/or drugs you may have taken in the past can fuck with that. also since the mdma itself doesn&#039;t actually make you feel anything (other than the lockjaw and body &quot;high&quot; associated with methamphetamines in general), if your brain for whatever reason doesn&#039;t have a lot of seratonin in there then you won&#039;t have such a strong euphoric effect. this is also why you should wait at least a week but better 3 or 4 between rolls -&gt; give your brain time to replenish its stores. i think certain vitamins are good for that as well, but i don&#039;t remember off the top of my head.<br /><br />i would just go ahead and try 180mg. or take 130 again, and then another 50 or 100 if you&#039;re not feeling anything. your gf should be fine with 120-150. put some good music on and have crazy sweaty sex for 3 hours straight. good times. also if you rail it then you can get a faster and somewhat stronger initial high. i recommend doing a few fat lines every 90 minutes, gives you a nice rhythm of peaks and plateaus. if you have pure crystals just keep doing it until you get bored/tired/run out. also make sure you smoke a ton of weed when you&#039;re coming down.<br /><br />also, don&#039;t listen to people&#039;s advice. do your own research and find out what works for you.
