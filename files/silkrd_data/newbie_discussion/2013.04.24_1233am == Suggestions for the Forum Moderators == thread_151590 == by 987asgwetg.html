				I think it is fairly obvious that there are alot idiots that posts total bullshit.&nbsp; People like me that really do what they are talking about end up sending PM&#039;s to people whom have legitimate concerns or questions.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t you ditch this whole Newbie thing and start moderating the forums and deleting messages that will either cause someone to destroy some expensive drugs or worse could result in someone seriously hurting themselves.&nbsp; Personally, I would like to see a section called &quot;Drug Safety&quot;, in which there a permanent posts that tell people how to test, clean drugs, and how to most safely use them.&nbsp; This is simply too important of a subject to be left to idiots that have either never done that which they are telling someone else to do, or have not done it enough to really understand that what they are doing.<br /><br />I would love to write one up on recrystallization, solubility and reagent testing. It&#039;s sad that people don&#039;t understand that a few ML of USP grade 200-proof dehydrated ethanol or Chloroform is all that is needed to clean up just about anything. on&#039;t understand.

				The 50 post policy was implemented by the admin, as is the rule that we - as moderators - are permitted to delete posts ONLY if they are scams, bitcoin spam, or endanger someone.

				I used to moderate a forum in a past life and it&#039;s tough thankless work. Thing is there are a lot of complaints about the 50 posts and I wonder if there isn&#039;t a more elegant solution to the problem. I&#039;m a vendor here, have been for 1.5 years now and I still can&#039;t respond to threads. I don&#039;t want to spam to 50 so damn it sucks. There has to be a better way : (

There is a Vendor whom receives alot of attention of the forums, whom shall not be named at this time because I fear that to do so would likely cause this conversation into one about my experience with certain substances instead of discussion about how to provide an environment in which there a definitive community validated sources of information that answer the most common subject matters, such as how do I verify the identity of this substance, how to I clean and purify this substance, is it dangerous to take this amount of a substance or take these two substances together, and place them in an index that that makes it easy for a forum member to locate and access the information.&nbsp; &nbsp;I view the wrong answer to all of such question as being capable of endangering someone.<br /><br />Here is a example I came across in one of the forums, and please keep in mind that this is a very rough and loose summation that is intended to convey the general context of the conversation, and does not accurately portray the entire discussion thread.<br /><br />&nbsp;A member posted that he did not experience any effects after taking one of 10 pills of MDMA that he had purchased, and another member replied he bought the same pills and rolled his ass off on 3 of them, the replying member further made a statement to the effect that 1 never does much and advised the original poster to take several of them. The tone of the exchange was on in which the replying member was strongly insinuating that the posting member was a pseudo raver.<br /><br />My perspective is that there should be one community reviewed and approved permanent post that persons with questions can consult if they are uncertain about the circumstances under which taking a second pill is an relatively safe thing to do.&nbsp; Nothing ever happens unless a dialog is first commenced, and so in the interest of promoting my suggestions about the structure of this forum, I have provided a&nbsp; quick and dirty version of what I believe such a post should say.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; <br />(1) Buy a test kit and personally subject each and every pill that you or a friend are intending to eat that night to multiple reagent tests<br /><br />(2) Never take more than one pill at a time, even if it tests perfectly. Eat one and if things are as they should be in after an hour and a halfor so, but you desire a more intense experience then go ahead and eat another full or half pill out of the stash of&nbsp; previously tested pills which you so expertly concealed in one of your female friends bras earlier that evening.<br /><br />(3) If the your first pill&nbsp; does not produce the expected effects within an 1 1/2 or so,&nbsp; enjoy dancing and hanging out with your friends and babysitting the inevitable moron whom is all sorts of fucked up because he ate every shitty pill people that you wisely, and responsibly refused to take, sober (or whatever state your currently in) . If your not feeling anything from that first pill after&nbsp; 3 or 4 hours it would be a great time to drop a couple of couple of Viagra because the little flashes of light and the blue hue will be be amusing while your giving that pill eating idiots rolling girlfriend the best the fucking of her life.&nbsp; Behind every irresponsible geeked out moron, is a hot rolling chick that is just dying to hang out with a real man who not only treats her with respect and kindness, but has a&nbsp; dick that stays hard as a rock for a long ass time.<br /><br /><br />(3) So long as you as your body hair (arms, and chest especially) is not standing up stiff, and your not sweating and covered in goose bump at the same time, feel free to repeat above step number (2) every couple or hours, until you either become content with intensity of your MDMA&nbsp; or start exhibiting the aforesaid physical signs. Basically, a what comes first scenario, you become either become content with the state you are presently in and enjoy it and stop taking more, or you start exhibiting physical signs of a good heavy roll, and you stop because taking anymore will not only change the euphoric state of empathy that you presently experiencing into a speedy hallucinatory one, but its a guaranteed path to Serotonin Syndrome as well. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
