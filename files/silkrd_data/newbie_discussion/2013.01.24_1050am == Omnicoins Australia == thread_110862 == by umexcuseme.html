				First post and its a question covered many, many, many time before....<br /><br />Advice? sorry if it seems a little cold but GIYF... (Google is your friend)<br /><br />On another note though WTF is going on with the vendors vanishing? I think there are 2 left in weed and 3 or so in meth.. 2 are new!!<br /><br />Anyway I just searched Omnicoins and got a thread that may be of interest to you..<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46583.msg499396#msg499396<br /><br />Good luck with your walk down the road mate.. hope you find what you are looking for.

				Hey umexcuseme<br />I was about to use omnicoin today and I was put off by one small detail. The require you to send a scan or photo of your deposit slip after you&#039;ve made your deposit. If you have a way of anonymously uploading and sending files then you should be ok. I haven&#039;t figured out a way to do this and I can&#039;t risk my anonymity.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used www.spendbitcoins.com a couple of times and they haven&#039;t let me down. They charge 10% on top of their rates so they&#039;re not as cheap but they are quick and discreet. They don&#039;t require a copy of your deposit slip unless the bitcoins don&#039;t make it to your wallet which has never happened to me.<br /><br />Both sites require an email address but that&#039;s easily overcome by using an anonymous email service (there&#039;s plenty of options if you google).<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

Maybe create a tormail account and upload the photo to that then send it to another email address, like gmail or yahoo, which you set up and access through a public computer at an internet cafe and send them the photo from there. There could be a simpler way. This whole thing is doing my head in actually. I cant even encrypt my address because I cant get gpgtools working on my mac.<br />I&#039;ll have a look at www.spendbitcoins.com and see how I go.<br /><br />

				Yeah, a public computer might be the way to go. <br /><br />But then again, all the sellers with photos of their goods must have uploaded the images anonymously. Need to do some investigating. <br /><br />I used spendbitcoins again with no problems. If only they were better value for money but I suppose you pay for a good service.<br /><br /><br />
