				Scout my man.. I hate to say it.. but.. I&#039;m with this guy on this one. What exactly did he do wrong to prompt a comment about him posting cryptic hints? Am I missing something? <br /><br />Aqua - Bro, welcome to the SR forums. Where hypocracy is the order of the day (unless you&#039;re a price fixing vendor who makes the powers that be money), and the mods/admins play favorites yet have the nerve to preach their liberterian musings on how censorship of any form is wrong. I saw your post earlier about the pervert lurking around here. Believe me, knowing the mods here... they never fail to defend such fuckbags and lock/delete/ban/take sides willy nilly. Don&#039;t expect fairness. Expect to be signled out for everything you do. Expect, if a vendor cusses at you and you put him in his place, the mods jump over backwards to do their bidding. <br /><br />Never fails to amaze me this place.

				I don&#039;t really do drama so idk what other posts this guy has (and don&#039;t care to look) but at least he&#039;s promoting awareness in a board that consists almost completely of spam. not taking sides just making an observation. also because i think tormail could be an easy thing to forget about for some people, especially newbies. <br />now can we be a happy family again?

				Haha promoting awareness. I&#039;m the last person on the PLANET to ever take a mod&#039;s side here :) And I never will :)<br />But it&#039;s obvious &quot;check your tormail&quot; is some kind of a plot to get someones attention. Or maybe get attention to himself. Hmm. <br />Well either way.. do we really want LE lurkers popping out of the woodwork and focusing on the SR forums of all things because 1 fucking disgrace to humanity hangs out here?<br /><br />Aqua - if you want to blackmail him, more power to you. Make the motherfucker pay!! Do realize though.. this shit might be better handled via PM or Tormail or whatever. We&#039;re a community of drug takers.. we have nothing to do with the darker side of the net. It&#039;s a complicated situation I guess.<br /><br />Scout - Dude.. if someone were to be anal here, his thread subject is not exactly enough proof to say he&#039;s blackmailing anyone. He&#039;s apparently telling someone to check their tormail.. but he doesnt say who and it seems like he&#039;s too smart to. Although why go through this if you&#039;re not gonna rock this child molestors world? I say out him if you&#039;re serious. Like Livestrong says.. promote the FUCK CP FANS awareness all day!

The longer you&#039;re here the less you have to check posts, you get to know who&#039;s a troll, who&#039;s confused, and who really is in the wrong, a mod for doing their job or a troll who may be pretending to be slow n order to troll a mod and take up their time, and from what I see, possibly from a shill. If this was the first post of mine you read, you&#039;d prolly think I&#039;m a troll. In reality I&#039;m nice and supre friendly, but not to dicks who come here to cause trouble. He is not &#039;promoting awareness on a board&#039; he is promoting awareness of the fact he has a bit too much time on his hands and likes to twist things, thus actually contributing to spam by taking up time from those who delete it while they argue over this silly little issue of his, while at the same time provoking and antagonizing that mod. You choose who to put your support behind. But I see where you are coming from. Just see where WE are coming from though.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140059.msg953259#msg953259">Quote from: WhisteBlower on March 29, 2013, 06:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Aqua - if you want to blackmail him, more power to you.

				You&#039;ve got no idea what you&#039;re talking about, since I remove and/or editted all my posts for a specific reason. That&#039;s all I have to say about the issue - for now.&nbsp; Scout and 1 other person know, and that&#039;s all that matters.<br />If you&#039;re that curious, you could PM scout yourself. But in good faith, I&#039;m not commenting on this one way or the other.. pending a couple of things. Good day.

				After clarifying things with DPR and inigo, I&#039;ve been given permission to delete these posts and the user for blackmailing someone after he got his info by pretending to be a vendor.&nbsp; This is the final warning - next time I see a cryptic post intended to continue this bullshit blackmailing, I will be deleting it.

Where hypocracy is the order of the day (unless you&#039;re a price fixing vendor who makes the powers that be money), and the mods/admins play favorites yet have the nerve to preach their liberterian musings on how censorship of any form is wrong.

Don&#039;t expect fairness. Expect to be signled out for everything you do.

				I give it 5 minutes before the next load of pointless drivel gets posted backed up with multiple shills all inflaming the situation and stiring up the natives.<br /><br />For any newbies out there reading this, this is how some keyboard warriors operate, create the illusion of truth and justification by posting from shill accounts expressing they are in agreement.
