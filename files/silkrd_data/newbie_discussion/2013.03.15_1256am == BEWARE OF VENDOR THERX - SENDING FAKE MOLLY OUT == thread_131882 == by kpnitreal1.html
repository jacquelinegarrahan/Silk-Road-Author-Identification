				So my order from THERX came in today.&nbsp; <br /><br />I purchased 1 g of his &quot;100% PURE MDMA&quot;<br /><br />As soon as I received it, it looked exactly like the bk-MDMA that everyone is peddling around here so I whipped out my trusty mecke and marquis test, sure enough.&nbsp; It turned yellow.<br /><br />What a shame.&nbsp; I guess i&#039;ll have to take this as a loss.

				I just received an order today as well, same size, though I haven&#039;t any testing reagent handy. (Mecke/Marquis results with yellow could be anything from a variant like Methylone to DMT to 2C-C, depending on what type of yellow result came up, and which of the two reagent categories the color registered in...). I was also part of the FE group (had done so before to gain credit/trust as a newcomer, and took the risk here as well... if it&#039;s not what I ordered I&#039;ll be rather disappointed), so no recourse will exist for me if this stuff turns out not to be what it was advertised as. <br /><br />If you can provide some more details on what the color results were like (was it the Mecke reagent, or the Marquis, or both? What sort of color yellow, and any changes over time to the test color, like going to green or red or brown?) that might be a bit more conclusive.<br /><br />Although one thing that gives me pause is why someone with months of background as a vendor and apparent high approval rating from their buyers would begin shafting people...

				Yeah, I noticed my error after posting (hence the correction). Either way, any more information on the testing would be informative. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have a reagent kit to whip out at the moment (and really should get another soon, at this rate...).

				I&#039;m pretty sure &quot;TheRX&quot; is the very same one being discussed; the OP and myself both ordered the same item, same amount, same vendor (although OP has the benefit of their M&amp;M kit...), and their profile is at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/112c67b631 . Earlier today their rating stood at 100% ... and now down to 96, despite all available readable feedback at a 5/5. . .

				Last week those &quot;100% molly&quot; listings were available along with, to my recall, a fair number of other offerings (like Xanax bars, and a couple other items that escape my recall). So, either it&#039;s all out of stock or has been withdrawn? (Or am I missing something and other listings aside from the one for Oxy are being viewed by others?) [N.B. I&#039;m not looking to shaft anyone without cause; I&#039;m just curious and wanting to get as much info as I can myself...]

They took the listings down last week.<br />I actually was planning on buying more but they took it down the night after I received the parcel. <br />I can post pics of product if you want. I&#039;ll post a pic of the dime-bag it came in so others can confirm<br /><br />When I messaged TheRX why they took it down. They cited that they had received too many orders in such a short amount of time.<br />And were holding off for safety.<br />They said&nbsp; that I should look for a re-listing sometime this week.<br /><br />&nbsp;When I added the molly listing to my cart initially it had round 180g of available product about 5 days later there was only 70g available the night before it was taken off listing. After the listing got popular the amount of people ordering may have snowballed. Plus they were offering a pretty decent deal. 1.7ish BTC per g. <br /><br />&nbsp;I have not tested my goods yet. So I don&#039;t know if its legit or not. I was planning on sending it out to a lab but may just opt for a marquis test instead.<br /><br />EDIT for Pics. OP, please post pics of content and the regent test. That way we can make a comparison. <br /><br />http://www.anonmgur.com/up/bfe673bc03231193a025f7221177d648.jpg Bag &amp; Contents<br />http://www.anonmgur.com/up/a0e70adf82d43d6d0bcb25d06bd3e2fd.jpg Contents<br />http://www.anonmgur.com/up/e9ae6a2ad97d069b31e49866bd1a6be6.jpg Bag w/ Contents

				Check out reddit&#039;s SR sub - another member has the same problem, which in turn means I will have the same problem since I ordered two grams. It&#039;s been in transit for seven days and have yet to receive it.

				Also, make sure you use the &quot;report vendor&quot; button on SR to report this clown.&nbsp; If enough people do that, SR Support will investigate and hopefully ban him before even more can be scammed.&nbsp;

				I also ordered from TheRx, was asked to FE because of my stats, well like a dumb ass I did. Two weeks latter nothing, wrote him to ask him what&#039;s up with the order and no response. Well lesson learned, at least it was only for a gram.

				I don&#039;t personally dislike Methylone, but yes it is nothing like good old real MDMA. Sure it&#039;s fun, but it is short lived, and doesn&#039;t have that push and great feelings you get on real MDMA. Why even push something and label it as something else. There are plenty of people that actually do enjoy M1 over MDMA.

				I&#039;m very sorry that it took me this long to respond to the allegations at hand. Like the saying goes, when it rains, it pours...I don&#039;t like revealing any personal info just because whatever we say can be used against all of us vendors in a court of law to identify each &quot;anonymous vendor&quot;. But due to the seriousness of the issue at hand, I feel the need to explain myself...I had a very serious family issue (my daughter has been extremely sick since Tuesday of last week and ended up getting hospitalized on Friday night when her fever spiked to 104.) and honestly, that was the first priority to me in my life. She IS my life. Anyone that has children will understand that nothing else in life takes priority over your kids. They have no one else in this world that they can depend on besides you. And just because some of you saw me online for a few minutes on Saturday, or Tuesday afternoon, doesn&#039;t mean that I was hiding from anyone or ignoring your messages. I truly didn&#039;t have the time to go through everyone&#039;s messages. Each message takes us vendors in between 3-5 minutes per message to open, read, respond, and reload our messages. Take 100 messages, that&#039;s 300-500 minutes of my day that I didn&#039;t have. I STILL have to go through everyone&#039;s messages.<br /><br />Anyways, I wasted about an hour writing a professional statement to address this issue, like the people who know me were expecting. It honestly seemed too robotic, so I decided to shoot straight from the hip on this one, partially because that&#039;s what a lot of you guys deserve and partially because I&#039;m absolutely hurt and disgusted by some of you. <br /><br />When I made the choice to leave Silk Road and take a break, things started getting out of hand with buyers pulling scams. I guess that was to be expected when we went from a small tight-knit community to getting national media attention and people coming out of the woodwork to join. Not to mention, where drugs are, scams will follow. It also doesn&#039;t help that buyers aren&#039;t charged a fee to sign up, which many of us vendors have asked to have changed. Everyone always blames the vendors, but there are FAR MORE BUYERS who scam on an everyday basis than the 1 or 2 vendors that pull scams every few months. There are pages and pages of threads in the hidden vendor&#039;s section of this very forum dedicated to all of the people who have tried to scam hardworking vendors and become blacklisted. When I ultimately made the choice to end my vacation and come back, I was told to be very careful of scammers because this place had really started going downhill...Not due to DPR, or any of the mods, or vendors, who all bust their ass on a daily basis to make this place what it is, but due to a lot of the noobie scumbag buyers who seem to think that they&#039;re owed something. <br /><br />To everyone saying that I&#039;m a scammer, or a con-artist, or whatever other immature bullshit, you can in plain English go fuck yourself. Buyers like you are the very reason why some vendors laugh all the way to the bank after they fucked you. The lack of respect shown to us vendors who work very hard to please everyone, and take a serious risk by putting our freedom on the line for a great cause (Silk Road) is sickening. Jumping to conclusions on every little thing, threatening us, not realizing that a lot of us bigger vendors get 50-60 messages per day and can get overwhelmed by them very easily, not understanding that we have lives outside of this place, the straight up harassment and numerous shitty messages that some of you send when you don&#039;t get your way because you&#039;re hidden behind a computer screen, acting like we have control of USPS being late, holding vendor&#039;s ratings hostage for bullshit reasons, thinking that we get rich, yet many of us make pennies and only do well by selling a big volume, because we have to be competitive with our pricing, and the fact that so many of you truly think that you are owed something and act like you&#039;re entitled, etc...is the exact reason why some vendors don&#039;t just close up shop and leave, but why they feel the need to stick it up all of your asses. Unfortunately, a lot of good, innocent, people are thrown into the mix, and why I would never advise a good vendor to do so. But some of you deserve everything that comes to you. Karma is a bitch. Same goes to the vendors that fucked innocent people, though. Fuck you too. <br /><br />As far as me scamming everyone...Use your head and think logically for a minute, how did I amass a perfect 5/5 100% rating through 1200 orders if I was a con-artist? With how picky people are, you don&#039;t think I&#039;ve had to come out of pocket on some orders to make people happy? That&#039;s the first thing. Second of all, I&#039;ve been here for over a year as a vendor, and more than 2 years in total, closer to 3 years...I&#039;m a grown man and not a 20 year old kid like a lot of you. I&#039;d like to think that I would&#039;ve come up with a far better scam than walking away with $2000-$3000 if I decided to scam anyone. The amount of money that I would lose in the long run from pill sales is that times 200. I have sold more pills on here than 99.9% of the other vendors, and left this place in the top 2% of vendors when I took my break for a couple of months. The only reason why my rating is not the same as when I left, and why my most of my reviews are gone, is because vendor&#039;s records are purged by SR every 3 months. <br /><br />Anyways, to the issue at hand...when I received the first message from someone claiming that they received bunk stuff on Wednesday or Thursday, that was after roughly 35+ 5/5 positive reviews, 4 messages of positive Marquis Regeant test results with thank you&#039;s, and a positive Marquis Reagent test result performed by myself. So put yourself in my shoes, what would be the first thing that you thought? A guy was trying to scam you, no? Not to mention, this is after being told upon returning to Silk Road, by other vendors who you were friendly with, that their was a serious problem with <br />buyers scamming hardworking vendors. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m far from an expert on MDMA, and never acted like I was. I am a large-scale pill retailer. I picked up MDMA for a customer of mine that asked me if I could get some because he was having a problem getting &quot;clean stuff&quot;. I didn&#039;t know anyone locally that sold it, at least in volume, because the people around here who do it, are young kids mainly in college. I did know someone who was over in Amsterdam at a world class school for Muay Thai training, knew it was a big deal over there and they get the best MDMA in the world, and he ended up reaching out to a friend for me who sold large quanities of MDMA. That&#039;s how this whole shit-show started. I ended up ordering a half pound. When I received it, I guess due to how it had to be packaged to get through customs (I have minimal knowledge of this, because I&#039;ve always refused to sell internationally), it was 8 individual ounces, individually vacuum sealed. When I first received it, I didn&#039;t even know that testing kits existed. It was only upon speaking to another MDMA vendor on here, after my product was already listed, that I learned of the testing kits, and purchased one trying to avoid all of this. You bet your ass if I knew that they existed before hand, I would&#039;ve made my buddy get one before it was sent to the states. I paid A LOT OF MONEY for the half pound. Why I didn&#039;t pull the listing down and wait for the testing kit to arrive, is because I had sold roughly a half of an ounce to my friend who asked for it, he shared it with a few local club kids here as well, and everyone had rave reviews, so I didn&#039;t think there would be an issue at all in selling it here on Silk Road. I was worried about getting scammed, so I was happy that the test kit was on it&#039;s way from DanceSafe.com.<br /><br />So upon receiving the &quot;bunk message&quot;, I placed a call to him informing him of someone complaining. Due to his busy training schedule, my work schedule, me running back and forth to the hospital, the other day to day responsibilities I have due to my family, and the time difference, we didn&#039;t first talk to each other until Saturday. I didn&#039;t tell him about the 35+ 5/5 reviews, the 4 positive marquis reagent test results, or the one that I performed by myself, because I didn&#039;t want it to influence the conversation that he had with his supplier. I knew his first response would be that some jerkoff is trying to screw you. After he spoke to the supplier, he was told that there was supposedly 25 kilo&#039;s in the batch that the supplier picked up, and he said that the only one complaining right now is me. Some guys bought kilos and full pounds, wouldn&#039;t they have test kits as well? Obviously, I don&#039;t know the dealer personally, but I do know the middle man (my friend) very well and I do trust what he says. So getting off the phone with him this time, I was pretty sure that the person who sent me the message was a liar and trying to extort me for some free MDMA. <br /><br />Now when I logged onto SR Sunday night, I saw that quite a few other people jumped on the bandwagon in saying that the stuff they received was fake. By that point, I realized that there was a problem of some sort. But then, even people who already rated it good, and said that they enjoyed it, had now changed their rating. (Even one of the people THAT SAID THEY TESTED IT!) So how many actually got bad stuff, and how many are just running with it thinking that they can get free stuff out of the deal? That&#039;s the problem I&#039;M HAVING with this whole thing. <br /><br />As far as how did ANYONE end up getting bunk stuff, when there was only one batch that I ordered, and others got real stuff? The ONLY thing that I can possibly think of, IF all of the people crying wolf are TELLING THE TRUTH, is that the supplier I bought from tried to mix in an ounce or two of methylone thinking that no one (me) would check every single ounce. Obviously, the majority of people that ordered from me got real deal, unadulterated, MDMA like advertised. As I said earlier, what I have left out of the half of pound, comes up as MDMA. But I don&#039;t have much at all to test. I have enclosed a picture (http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/x.php?x=8qt.jpg). A lot of other people have received MDMA that came up purple/black, as well. I didn&#039;t order more than one batch, as I said, and after this whole nightmare, I will not be ordering anymore or selling MDMA ever again. It was too much bullshit to deal with in the beginning with vacuum sealing, tons of pointless messages that sounded like 15 year olds wrote them, which I don&#039;t receive for pill orders, waiting days for guys to get high before they release your funds, etc...now this is ultimately the cherry on top of the cake for me. Fuck selling MDMA. And I give you vendors that sell it a lot of credit. You deserve every penny that you make. Now I know why there&#039;s a hole in the market for big MDMA sellers on here.<br /><br />I know a lot of people who did receive the bk-mdma are asking for partial refunds, but personally I&#039;m going to refund them 100%. Anyone that can show me a picture which shows my bag, and a yellow test result, will get the 100% refund, including shipping costs (I&#039;m not responsible for deflation or inflation of bitcoin values, I&#039;m refunding exactly what I received according to SR). I&#039;m exposing myself to a ton of scamming, because you can test any methylone to get a free bag out of me, but it&#039;s the best way that I can think of. Also, anyone that changes my rating back to a 5/5, I&#039;m going to throw them a little something extra (a $20 SR gift code) for the inconvenience of this whole mess and being understanding throughout everything that happened. If anyone isn&#039;t happy with that, I can always throw you nothing too.<br /><br />I&#039;m not running from anyone, I&#039;m here to stay, as always, I didn&#039;t intend to screw anyone, and I tried/am trying to do my best to figure out what went wrong and fix the situation. I was already overwhelmed with orders and messages before this nonsense happened, and my daughter going to the hospital made my life go into a complete tailspin. Just please be patient, and give me a little bit of time to go through all of the messages, figure out who got what and refund the people that need to be refunded. If you didn&#039;t fall asleep yet (from reading this book), I&#039;d also like to thank everyone that wasn&#039;t immature, actually were understanding, and personally apologize to you for any inconvenience and/or aggravation that this has caused. <br /><br />Take care,<br /><br />-TheRX

				As someone who is not a liar or a scammer, that message from TheRX did nothing to make me feel better.&nbsp; I certainly sympathize with his family situation.&nbsp; He accuses buyers of overreacting.&nbsp; But despite his high ratings prior to this incident, it&#039;s not unprecedented for an established vendor to go out with a big scam, so it&#039;s perfectly understandable that people reacted the way they did to his absence from the site and no response to messages.<br /><br />I bought two packets from him that were both 100% methylone.&nbsp; He tries to get us to believe that he didn&#039;t know there were testiing kits for MDMA.&nbsp; The marquis reagent has been available for decades.&nbsp; Pill vendors in the listings on SR mention the test results all the time.&nbsp; If he&#039;s that ignorant he shouldn&#039;t be selling MDMA at all.&nbsp; He should certainly not be importing large quantities of off-whte chemicals from overseas and selling them to people when he has no idea what the chemical is.&nbsp; That is the height of irresponsibility and is frankly just not believable.&nbsp; He tried to bribe me to give him a 5 feedback rating with a gift code, but I said my feedback was not for sale.&nbsp; The resolution center apparently agreed since I got everything I wanted in resolution today and made a profit in the bitcoins as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now here&#039;s my question... Does anyone know why my feedback, and in fact none of the negative feedback that brought his score from 100 to 88, shows up on his vendor page.&nbsp; There&#039;s something seriously wrong with the system if there&#039;s some way he got it to disappear from his vendor page.&nbsp; The 88 is still there, but not feedback less than 5, and only two pages total of ratings show up from a two month period.&nbsp; Something is very wrong with that.

				Hey TheRx,<br /><br />Man, read your message and yeah thank you for posting it; clears up a lot of questions. Willing to give you the benefit of the doubt here -- know how it goes, sometimes shit comes up and priorities have to take priority right? Totally get that. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interesetd, guess the big frustration for me was just absolutely ZERO word from you. And for weeks. Not even just a quick 1min profile update that says: <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;hey sorry y&#039;all, some heavy shit has come up, and i know this sucks, but will def. fix it. Nothing that affects you, just give me 2 weeks to sort this out. Promise!&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>or whatever. Sure some assholes still gonna cry &quot;murder!&quot; yeah, but for the rest of us, it helps build trust and keep solid connection with your peeps.<br /><br />Without that, ya know, anything could have happened... remember, buyers are taking risks too, so... thoughts are like:<br /><br />- &quot;did shit get intercepted?&quot;<br />- &quot;is the vendor comprimised?&quot;<br />- &quot;is my drop address safe?&quot; <br />- &quot;should i be looking over my shoulder?&quot;<br />- &quot;imma &#039;bout to get my shit raided?&quot; etc.<br /><br />And really just a quick 1-line profile update when shit goes south, shows you&#039;re thinking about your peeps, recognizing they going through hell too trying to figure out what happened, and assures them to sit tight and that there&#039;s nothing to worry about. <br /><br />Basically shows you&#039;re a stand up guy, taking responsibility for this shit, not leaving us all hanging. 1min is all it takes.<br /><br />So yeah, if something like this happens again, please think to drop a quick update on your profile until you can get to answering every message. It goes a LONG way to keeping all this shit on the good side and keeping your customers sane &amp; loyal.<br /><br />Anyway, that said, sorry to report the shit arrived and am among the crowd who got the bunk shit. Here&#039;s a reagent test performed today (http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/xw.jpeg). If you want me to do another test &amp; write your name on it, can do that too, no problem man... just tested quick so you&#039;re not left wondering.<br /><br />As this is not what was ordered, please refund as you said and we&#039;ll just call this a random few weeks when the wind didn&#039;t go well for either of us. <br /><br />Will post this same message in the order Resolution Center on the road, once it&#039;s back up.<br /><br />Trust you&#039;ll do the right thing here. Cool?

				Summary: Sorry, issues in my personal life meant that I sent you methylone instead of the MDMA you paid for. It is just a coincidence that when things like this happen, people never get MDMA instead of methylone. Take the gift codes. I hope other buyers don&#039;t see this thread.

				-TheRX:<br />I&#039;m not sure about how to go about comparing your regular customers over the last few years to the &quot;kids&quot; these days on the internet looking to score some X. <br />But as an experiment... I invite you to pull this exact (MDMA -&gt; M1) stunt with your regular clientele... You already have good reviews and you&#039;re reputable as a supplier of quality opiates. So next time just throw them a cap of Tylenol 3 caps in place of their $30 order of 1 oxy. Then... Make them wait and wait... But Wait! Better yet; crush those Tylenol 3 and tell them it&#039;s 100% pure oxycodone. I&#039;m sure no one would be the wiser. No one would be upset at all.&nbsp; If anyone complains just blame your source/personal problems.<br /><br />Maybe for you it was an honest mistake? But you still ended up dicking a ton of people. You said you&#039;d never pull a scam this petty for a measly few grand. And we believe that... But all the while your reviews went from (100) to (83). So obviously something went wrong. You&#039;re in a position where you can make things right. I&#039;ll gladly clean up my reviews and forum posts when you resolve this. But why should any buyer who was sold inferior shit have to spend another 40% in addition to the transaction just to buy materials (a test kit) to prove that the seller screwed them (for a refund)? Sure, I&#039;d get more money back if you&#039;re good on your promise. But it&#039;s just a matter of principle. The buyers that you screwed (be it intentionally or not) shouldn&#039;t be paying to check on your mistakes and clean up your mess.

				Despite the earnest reply from TheRX over a week ago, haven&#039;t heard a single peep from him since. And am one of the ones that got burned by fake shit.<br /><br />Have posted regent tests, showing full yellow (Methylone) and according to his word, am due 100% refund, but nothing has changed yet. Order is still in dispute, with no reply from him, and have even given extra time in good faith, but still no reply.<br /><br />Has been nearly a month since order, and have received precisely 1 message from TheRx; a copy/paste of his forum post above.<br /><br />Disappointed. Maybe some mod can resolve this in the Resolution Center, since clearly TheRx has given up making any effort for customers on this.
