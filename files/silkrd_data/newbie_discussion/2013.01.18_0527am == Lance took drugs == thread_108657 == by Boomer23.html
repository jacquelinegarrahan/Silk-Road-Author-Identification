				I think the interest in the Lance Armstrong story is not that he was on the gear but that he went around suing people trying to out him.<br />Like most professional sports stars he was/is a massive douchebag!

He flew on Apollo 11 along with Buzz Lightyear and Michael Porter.

				Lance Armstrong wasn&#039;t on the moon, that&#039;s just silly. He was nothing but a jazz man from New Orleans, with some mad trumpet skills.

				<br />I&#039;m not quite sure why so many people actually believed lance armstrong was clean for so long. I don&#039;t think any less of him because of this latest controversy. I feel sorry for him and his poor gullible fans, it&#039;s like growing&nbsp; up and&nbsp; finding out that Santa Claus don&#039;t actually exist<br /><br />His book first book was one of the most inspirational reads ever. Honestly if you feel like your life kinda sucks right now start reading that book<br /><br />Tour De France times are 5% slower now with the extensive testing.<br /><br />The UFC for example allows steroid use as long as you have a medical exemption. Case in point Dan Hendersons career highs at his age<br /><br />

				If anyone believes this was not the norm in sports for a long time, you will be very disappointed. On one hand I could care less what he did as long as the gaming is being played at a high level and entertaining. On the other hand I feel like I did back in the days of the East Germans in the Olympics blah. He certainly was a beast on his bike but very questionable off.
