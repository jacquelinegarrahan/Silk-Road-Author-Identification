In the UK, fake names are fine as letters get delivered to door number and postcode so the name is usually irrelevant.<br /><br />If you&#039;re living in shared accommodation for instance and you notice that mail gets delivered to past tenants then as a rule of thumb a fake name should be all that is necessary.<br /><br />Anyone from elsewhere care to chime in?<br /><br />Be Good.

				But consider I am going to give my real address. Where I live. Because I don&#039;t have any abandoned destinations in my mind where I could receive a letter from a vendor.<br /><br />So you mean giving a fake name is a necceserity?&nbsp; :)

				In the US generally for personal use people use their real name and address. Fake names can arouse suspicion or not get delivered at all. Fake addresses even moreso. For resale you&#039;d need to set up / get drop addresses.

				Depends on origin. Generally it&#039;s okay. But makes no difference really. If you get busted, you get busted.

				Just send yourself letters with the fake name you would want to use and you&#039;ll know if it works or not... It just sucks if it&#039;s a package and you&#039;re not there and you have to pick it at the post office because you&#039;ll most likely need an ID then and your order will get lost. <br /><br />Using your real name is fine though. Using 50 different fake names will pretty suspicious though and if you use the same fake name regularly without ever returning anything it&#039;s suspicious too.. If you use your real name, you can always deny ordering anything since anyone that wants to cause you trouble could just send you drugs. If they see you&#039;ve received 20 packages under the same fake name or under different fake names, you don&#039;t really have as much plausible deniability anymore, unless you have a pretty good explanation for that.<br /><br />And for the record, signing or not doesn&#039;t make any difference if you get a controlled delivery and you accept the package (in the US).
