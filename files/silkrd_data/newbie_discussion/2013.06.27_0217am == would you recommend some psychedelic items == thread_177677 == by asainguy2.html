				LSD, DMT, and MDMA.<br /><br />Crystal X is a very gentle psychedelic, unless you take an unsafe dose there isn&#039;t much hallucination to speak of.&nbsp; It alters your mind in a truly spectacular fashion though, it&#039;s definitely worth trying at least once.<br /><br />Acid and DMT both produce legitimate psychedelic trips, but if you dose responsibly you shouldn&#039;t be too overwhelmed.

I was completely fine with walking, body load was not an issue. I didn&#039;t experience heaviness or nausea like I would with shrooms. Talking is so-so, I had to try really hard not to sound like a giggling idiot but I could manage if I was talking over the phone. It&#039;s really fun, he said it&#039;s great for a day at the beach which is hard to imagine until you try it.

				LSD and 25i. I&#039;d definitely say lsd is better but for the price of 25i it makes it worth it. a 1200ug blotter which seems to be fairly standard on SR lasts typically 4-8 hours depending on your tolerance. You will be able to walk around and I&#039;ve never had problems talking face to face on it but everyone&#039;s different so I can&#039;t assure you.

				before i encourage experimentation with any psychotropic substances i advise doing your homework on the chemical composition as well as physiological effects of any you choose to indulge in. With safe use these substances can improve the quality of your life on many levels (some would argue every level). If misused there can be consequences on both a physical or mental level. To use irresponsibly is to give our respective interests a bad name and hinder any efforts to reduce the stigma that exist in conventional society.<br /><br />That being said have some fun!&nbsp; <br /><br />well if you wish to start out slow and easy i would advise Lsa (baby wood rose or morning glory seeds) are good introductions for tripping, both for a psychedelic state and a slight physical discomfort which a few worthwhile substances have.<br /><br />mushrooms of most kinds rock as well and can bring you pretty far and are great for getting ones feet wet. Always make me feel silly.<br /><br />L S D has a great deal to offer in terms of diversity of experience, although can be quite uncomfortable to those who become anxious. Using proper education and moderation, i plan to use it my whole life, like a few others.<br /><br />mescaline is hard to find, i advise just extracting it yourself if you can get the cactus mailed to you. but mescaline is by far my favorite, it is sensual, euphoric, forgiving, subtle, and expansive. I owe much awareness to the cactus &lt;3<br /><br />ketamine when used with caution can also be quite expansive. It provided entirely new interior planes of awareness for myself, but also has a reputation for encouraging irrational beliefs when used compulsively. <br /><br />4 aco-dmt is quite lovely, very sparkly and hallucinatory although i am yet to know what damage continued use it may have. quite fun though it merrits at least one or two goes.<br /><br />many 2-c research chems are worthwhile but can be quite uncomfortable i suggest after a few years of mushrooms and acid maybe look at these.<br /><br />d m t is quite powerful and its existance in every living thing has some implications, or at least one may be driven to extrapolate of of such an astounding fact. try it, expect nothing, accept everything, and be critical of any assumption.<br />&nbsp;mdma and mda are not so much hallucinitory although i have had auditory and visual hallucinations off both i count them because psychedelics etymological roots are, mind manifesting, which i interpret as awareness or mind in a state of becoming. this takes place as a unique sensory or psychological environment, and i feel both mdma and mda provide this. try it out in small doses and gradually raise them based on comfort.

				there are many impartial studies that just offer information on safe use and what to do when someone od&#039;s. i have helped provide harm reduction for people who have both overdosed or found themselves in psychosis, and although i do not need the same, we need to offer support within our community.

X has never done LSD nor read about it, all his friends have and they recommend it to him. X has a family history of mental health illness and if he uses this just take it and see how it goes attitude he could very possibly bring on a psychosis. Whereas if he had spent 15-20 minutes reading on erowid he would see that it is not recommended to people predisposed to mental health issues. Drugs can have too big an impact(seen it first hand as well) to not know everything you can about them before putting it into your body...just my 2c

				Ok besides from the reviews which you can&#039;t really say are bullshit because everyone&#039;s interpretation/experience with a drug can be different, the information erowid has on a huge variety of drugs is such a useful resource...for those who care about their health I suppose.

				i mentioned other substances other than lsd mushrooms and dmt (but mushrooms do have a toxicity level and i find it unwise to eat more that your body can deal with) are also psychadellic but have a sensitive dose rate and can be hard on the body. it is better to cover your bases then not.<br />ketamine and many research chems need to be administered with care, and i belive this for all substances just out of respect for there potential and power. but yes we are all autonomous, even free to attack others rather than reasonably holding a discourse.

				I have tried a lot and dmt is a really easy psy to do. I mean this by it has no anxiety which pretty much means you won&#039;t have a &quot;bad trip&quot; its really short and a great experience. Out of all psy I have done dmt is the one I&#039;d recomend for anyone who is new to psychedelics. <br /><br />But all around my favorite is 25i it is amazingly fun. And cheap its the one I take the most

				Since DMT is so short it would be better to use Changa.<br /><br />Changa lasts longer and the come up is not as fast.
