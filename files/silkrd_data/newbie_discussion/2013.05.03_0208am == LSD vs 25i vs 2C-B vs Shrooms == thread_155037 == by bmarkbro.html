I think you know this, but I&#039;m just throwing a small amount of caution into the wind that should be taken when ingesting ANY substance, regardless of how safe it is perceived to be.

				LSD is the most amazing one by far seriously you will laugh till you cry so many times I took 4 hits 3 days ago and laughed so hard the whole day my abs were sore great visuals no taste notlike that shitty 25i horrible taste almost ruins trip, 2cb only took once in a light amount seemed kinda like a roll to me but I was real young when i took it 2c e is intense as fuck but again not a fan of the chems.&nbsp; <br /><br />shrooms are almost as great as lsd it is just a little bit easier to freak out at nothing maybe leading to a slight bad trip happend to me only once but was my only bad trip ever so it kinda scarred me ha

Good, clean L is tasteless and should leave you feeling rejuvenated the next morning.<br /><br />The morning after 25i feels like I ate some bad ecstasy rolls... probably because lots of rolls are laced with 25i&nbsp; :o

				Mushrooms all the way my friend. If you haven&#039;t heard of Terence Mckenna I suggest you do some research and listen to a few of this lectures, and you&#039;ll gain some insight into the power of them. Also I would suggest including DMT in that list of what ifs.&nbsp; 8)
