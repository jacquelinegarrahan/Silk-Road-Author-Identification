				Hi guys,<br />I want to try DMT, but I don&#039;t like the vaporization methods out there, so I came up with my own. I would like to hear your thoughts on it. Here&#039;s the idea:<br /><br />1. Place the DMT at the bottom of a glass jar<br />2. Cover the top of the jar with duct tape<br />3. Puncture two holes in the duct tape and insert a straw in each one. Position one straw towards the top of the jar and the other towards the bottom. Seal the gap between the straws and the duct tape &quot;lid&quot; with more duct tape. tape the ends of the straws so they bend and seal.<br />4. Fill a large bowl with warm water and place it in the microwave. Put the jar in the bowl. Heat for 30s at a time, stirring the water in between. The water will keep the temperature from increasing past 100C which should be enough to vaporize the DMT<br />

				sounds like it might work. I dont know. I would just search the web for instructions on how to make &quot;the machine&quot; or &quot;the key&quot;. They both work good. I like the machine better. Plus it is portable. Good luck!!!

				Why going through all this trouble when you can simply create a machine in like 1 minute of time?<br />It is much less complicated doing it than using what you want to use. Not saying it will not work (never tried but in theory it could) but IMO it is more hassle than needed.<br /><br />You say you don&#039;t like the other methods you researched but can you please explain what you don&#039;t like in the machine, for example? I can guarantee you that the heat transfer method of the machine is the best (your method even if working doesn&#039;t come even close), the only things that can beat it is something like the volcano.

				volcano would be the best indeed (with digital dial). You dont need weed after DMT, i even would advise against it. DMT is not for getting &quot;fucked up&quot;, its real aim is a spiritual journey, so you dont need anything afterwards. You will feel happy and refreshed, no crash whatsoever IME.

				I looked at the DBV and volcano, but they&#039;re both too expensive for me right now. As for the machine, I have a couple problems:<br /><br />1. I don&#039;t like idea of vaporizing on metal. Glass should be less toxic<br />2. I don&#039;t have any tools to cut glass<br />3. It&#039;s possible to burn the DMT<br /><br />The machine has much higher heat transfer, but it shouldn&#039;t matter. In my method, the temperature is held constant, so even though all the DMT isn&#039;t immediately vaporized, eventually all of it will be.

				OK guys,<br />I&#039;ve been there :D <br /><br />I tried the bulb, I sandwiched DMT in a bong, I builtt a machine - and wasted a lot of DMT on the way.<br /><br />Now I use a long pipe with a porcelain head with a size that takes about the first joint of my ring finger.<br />I put a pipe screen on the bottom, some cigarette ash, then the DMT, than more ash to completely cover the DMT.<br />Take a lighter, hold it abut 1/2 to 3/4 inch above the pipe head and start inhaling slowly. I can toke 50mg in one puff this way.<br /><br />Have fun (and don&#039;t waste as muck money as I did on useless pipes.<br />

				I would be very interested to hear if it works for you because there is very little information on DMT&#039;s boiling point.<br />I doubt, however, that you will get it going at 100C, but please keep us posted.<br /><br />From my experience the machine is the best way forward and there is no need for drilling if you can get your hands on a mini bar bottle of Martell cognac - just a screwdriver and a hammer.<br /><br />Find a thread dedicated to DMT (search for &quot;deemsters&quot; and you shall get there) - see OP and posts by myself of dmtnexus and you will get to the technique of making the machine without drilling :)

For the amount of heat put there&#039;s no difference whatsoever.<br />2. You don&#039;t need them. A single screwdriver + hammer is enough.<br />3. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really possible to burn the DMT with the machine because of the way the brillo is done (the heat transfer of the metal + air + intermingled lines). I once tried intentionally to burn it by keeping a very high flame directly on top of the brillo but I couldn&#039;t burn the DMT; it vaporized completely at once before it could burn. The only direct possibility of burning the DMT with the machine is when you charge it.

				Everyone seems to be using Merck&#039;s data on DMT&#039;s boiling point of 60 to 80C.<br /><br />It looks like Shulgin was saying that it must be wrong even on theoretical level.<br /><br />Here is an interesting post picked up from here - *clearnet warning* - http://www.psychonaut.com/ayahuasca-dmt/40697-dmt-crystals-volcano-vaponizer.html#post647471<br /><br />It looks like DMTs boiling point is in fact closer to 160 to 180C.<br /><br />Here is full text:<br /><br />&quot;Volcano +DMT test completed successfully&nbsp; <br /><br />i used Temperature range 180-190 °C (my logic saying me if we above boiling point 160°C , the exact temperature doesn&#039;t matter until we stay below burning point ) <br /><br />I used separate balloon for DMT and the only part of Vaponizer that kept smell after use (btw smell not strong at all) is &#039;Filing chamber&#039;, but i cleaned it with vodka and smell disappeared straight away. <br /><br /><br />Practical observation: filing of Volcano balloon takes 30 seconds, where DMT vaporized approx in 10-15 Sec (*within temp range i used 180-190 °C ). Meaning , there is no need to wait until balloon is full, as half of it will be just hot air. Balloon contains 4 hits, where you can only take 2 hits of DMT (with correct dosage , etc , you just don&#039;t have time for 3rd hit as after 2nd one you already in another space (lets called the Unknown -) for now). Taking above said into account, if you use it alone fill only half balloon (otherwise your dosage will be half and other half will be lost ), if you share it with friend (which i did) fill balloon fully. Bear in mind the dosage and idea: doesn&#039;t matter how many crystals you put inside filling chamber, all will be inside a balloon within 15 sec. &quot;

				Maybe start off with 35mg work your way up. But &quot;they&quot; say 50mg will most definitely break you through. I tend to think so too. But I would suggest changa if you really don&#039;t have a proper way to vape.

Get some shredded b.caapi vine and vape some of that a few times solo first. Not only will you get a MOAI into your system the vine will guide your journey. Mix some vine and DMT together in a 50/50 ratio and load 100mg into the genie. Take long slow hits and blastoff. Much like doing 5+g of mushrooms make sure you take the 4th hit off the genie if you really want a spiritual trip. The plus side is that with the MOAI in your body you do not have to wait between bowls.

				I use the plastic bottle and tin foil technique that I learned from some cool black dude on YouTube called myjeanz and he goes by the name Young Morpheus on twitter. Its pretty simple and highly effective but lately I&#039;m worried about how much burning plastic I could be inhaling. Also I think smoking of tinfoil is pretty bad for you but if you got nothing else and you want to break on trough to the other side then its a good option. Personally I&#039;m trying to buy a glass vapor genie because that what everyone raves about but they don&#039;t sell them in the UK and shipping it from the US is pretty expensive and will probably take a month to arrive. Hopefully I can find a UK seller. Anyway I though I would post the link to the video explaining the bottle technique, hope it helps.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtckVptu4I4<br /><br />Peace.

				On weed in a water bong.&nbsp; use a torch lighter and dont let any flame contact the dmt.&nbsp; Take the blast in two hoots.<br /><br />Hold the first in till you start to feel tingly. then slowly start smoking again and try to torch out any remaining dmt.<br /><br />30-50mg is a good way to play.
