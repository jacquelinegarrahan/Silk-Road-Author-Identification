				A little concern about peoplesdrugstore disappearance as well as them shutting down their website! I had an order in with them and now that I think about it they could easily be selective scammers. Anyone else concerned or heard anything from them??

				They were reported multiple times for instructing customers to purchase their products through their website, forum, or email in order to avoid SR vendor fees.&nbsp; That is blatantly against the rules.&nbsp; You can&#039;t use SR to advertise your product and get customers only to then complete sales outside of SR to avoid the fees.

				scout,<br /><br />i CAN UNDERSTAND him not allowed to use SR to promote his site, but how can u guys make him shut his site down? and just wondering what could u really do if he told u guys to fuck off he was keeping it up? Im not being a smart ass im wanting to know , what could SR really do other than bitch at him and suspend him from SR? and then he could continue selling on his own site, <br /><br />hes gone to BMR and is gonna advertise his site and bring it back up soon,so i dont think u guys have done much really.. And now its possible a few of us have lost our drug orders, u could have giving him enough time to finish the sales he made to us and all before u had him shut down shop.. <br /><br />If i dont get my order I want some coins from somwhere,n rite now SR is the reason he shut down for now.. Hell be back up from what i understand though just in a more undercover way

				Ya I am a little caught, I think its &quot;righgt&quot; that SR would shut him down if he was using it to advertise but to hold his BTC is &quot;wrong&quot; Now his own site is shut down,Probably cause he wants to get his 50 BTC back.&nbsp; IF someone is doing worng, shut them down, its not neccessary to steal their money in the process. Guess thats what you get when you get a community of drug addicts together regardless of where it is.

				I made an order from him on SR and got it. He mentioned his webite in a PM and I decided to make a purchase there cause they had lower prices. So I make the order and should have it monday. What was odd though is that they started giving excuses that they couldn&#039;t ship it on time. Then they sent me a message saying that prices were going to &#039;go up&#039; on Monday and that were should order soon. This does not sit well with me.

				Might be a good time to remind people who might not already know -- even if you hear about a product on SR and see that the person is a vendor here, if you place your order elsewhere (like on the vendor&#039;s personal website or via email or whatever else) SR will not be able to do anything to help you if you have an issue or are scammed.&nbsp; Just something to keep in mind.&nbsp; :)

				I ordered for PDS last Christmas season. I ordered some hash oil viles (FE&#039;d money I was willing to lose). They took 6 weeks to arrive! PDS took a long time to answer messages but they did answer eventually. Just sayin that 21 days is not always enough time (even though it should be more than enough).<br /><br />At the risk of stating what has already been stated repeatedly;<br />Do not Finalize Early unless you are willing to lose your money.<br />If you ask on the forums, you will find the product you&#039;re looking for from a vendor who wont make you FE.

				For those that dont know DO NOT ORDER FROM PDS WEBSITE ! He has had a message on BMR for a long time stating that the webmaster locked him out of his website after making it and pretending to be him and stealing money from all the orders! do not order anything from that website, only order off him on BMR (which is the real PDS even uses the same pgp key) <br />and also so everyone knows I had an order in with him here on SR after SamGiancanna attempted to rip me off which i did not fall for. So he got banned while My order was placed with him in processing still, once I got my coins back I still wanted to order off him cause Ive had lots of good orders with him never a problem, so I transfered my coins to BMR and placed an order with him, (Heroin and crack) It took a lil longer for him to ship it cause he said he had bunk rock at first so he got good stuff, He gave me extra for the delay. <br /><br />it did take awhile to get the tracking # but he also stated that he didnt want to give them out unless there was a problem or it was longer then 5 days cause he spent too much time replying and hunting down tracking #s (those are his words)<br /><br />anyways the stuff showed up today and its dynamite both products and i got my extra, so I have to vouch for him cause I have done multiple orders from him and he has always came through. <br /><br />Just thought I would mention this since its only fair to let ppl know that he does come thru

				Just want to do the right thing and recant my statement about PDS.&nbsp; My BMR order arrived today (ordered during the ddos) after an experience similar to the above poster.&nbsp; In my defense the package was actually mailed 12 days after he assured me it would go out &quot;immediately - the next day&quot;.&nbsp; There definitely is a connection between them and CDN (scammer) though.

				yes Mine was sent out late as well, I think He had some hiccups on his end, I sent him a message and let him know that He would benefit from just being honest with his buyers if hes having some issues on his end and the package hasnt gone out yet, becuase as a buyer you feel like your being strung along and its the same things a scammer does so you start to get sketched out right away.&nbsp; Im sure he meant well cause He did come through in the end for me and you! so hopefully he reads that and takes it to heart cause He is true to his word in the end and not a scammer. So I would not give up on him yet, (Im not)
