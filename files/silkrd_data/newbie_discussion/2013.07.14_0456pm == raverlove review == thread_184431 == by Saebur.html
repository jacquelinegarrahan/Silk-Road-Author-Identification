				Took 10 days to reach east coast usa due to vendor&#039;s emergency but was compensated with 2 extra caps &lt;3<br /><br />I honestly thought I got scammed but he finally came through :)<br /><br />This looks VERY clearer than the stuff I usually get. <br /><br />Some of the shards are literally see through. My assumption is that it&#039;s quality stuff :P<br /><br />I don&#039;t really care if the label is hand written or not, as long info is discarded correctly :)<br /><br />UPDATE: Tested great. Took one of his 140mg extra caps. It was one of the best ones I&#039;ve had. Been getting a lot of stuff that hasn&#039;t been hitting with that euphoria hard and this did it. Long lasting and peaked for a while. This is indeed quality. Next day I feel just hungry cause I didn&#039;t have the stomach to eat last night. Not depressed, but refreshed. I got a lot off my chest and my mind feels clearer. I honestly love the rolls, that feel as if it&#039;s life changing and this did exact that. I don&#039;t like the ones that just give you the fucked up feeling, and drugged up. Honestly a theurpedic night. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for the love R.L.

				I got my order from raverlove a couple days ago. It took longer than I had hoped, and did indeed include extras. Haven&#039;t tried it yet, but I will soon. Thank you!
