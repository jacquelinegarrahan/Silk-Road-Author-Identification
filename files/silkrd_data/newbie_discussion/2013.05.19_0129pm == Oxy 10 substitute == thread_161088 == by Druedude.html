				Well theres probably a dozen substitutes for OC 10&#039;s.<br /><br />Whats readily available to you? <br /><br />&nbsp;You can get a 30mg blueberry, take a razor to it, cut it into 4 quarters, and dose that way. Maybe a 15mg greeny?<br /><br />&nbsp;I would personally cut the shit and get some H, but I dont feel comfortable advising people that havnt and/or dont use heroin, to start.

				Morphine has a fairly similar potency to oxy, and it is readily available.&nbsp; There is a reason it is the gold standard for pain control.&nbsp; You can easily plug it (rectal) if you want a stronger hit.<br /><br />If you are truly a chronic pain patient then methadone can do wonders for pain, and it is cheap and not hard to get a script for.&nbsp; If you&#039;re an addict then I wouldn&#039;t touch methadone outside of a clinic.&nbsp; You need something for when you hit rock bottom.&nbsp; Trust me.<br /><br />If you take it orally you could look into Opana (oxymorphone).&nbsp; Be aware that it is MUCH more potent sniffed, plugged, or injected.&nbsp; This is a very powerful narcotic that needs to be treated with care.&nbsp; 10mg oxy is a sliver of a 40mg opana in equivalence for analgesic dosing.<br /><br />Be careful, and make sure this is where you want to go with drugs.&nbsp; Heroin will wreck you, and make no mistake about it you are doing heroin.

				Exercise and a healthy diet maybe?<br /><br />I&#039;m not a fan of psych meds being used outside of a therapy setting, so I wouldn&#039;t comment even if I had the answer.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are after euphoria then any opiate will give a similar taste to the oxy you&#039;re used to.<br /><br />Good luck.

				You could try the fentanyl nasal spray from SunWu, it has the cheapest price-per-dose of all the opiates on the road (except for the pure fentanyl but that&#039;s just way too dangerous), being at 70 cents a dose equivalent to 10mg of oxy. <br /><br />For depression I&#039;d recommend ketamine if you&#039;re into self-medicating though, it&#039;s the most effective treatment for depression, starting to act right after you take a dose, and its antidepressant action lasts 7 to 10 days, which makes you avoid addiction and also makes you not be high all the time. Ketamine reverses the neurological damage caused by stress, which drastically improves your mood if depressed, it makes you grow more neurons in a way.

				yah generally opiates arn&#039;t prescribed for depression. if you take then regularly and become addict its likely to add a lot of depression to your life. that being said, i dont think there is any substitutes for opiates in the way they make you feel. 10mg oxycodone is a very low dose. you could try raising your oxycodone dose or using a smaller dose of a strong opiate ie. hydromorph, oxymorph, h, eyc..<br />if your looking for a completely different drug besides opiates best bet is to just try a couple ofthem. its often a matter of opinion. some people find smoking weed helps, other people like ketamine or benzos.<br />you could try going to the doctor for psych meds and getting an ssri or some other antidepressant. you have to take the regularly so it would make more sense to get a prescription. the effectiveness of antidepressants are disputed.

				I&#039;ve tried many FDA approved meds. Currently taking 60 mg Paxil and 300 mg Wellbutrin xr. Xanax prn at .5<br />I also like the feeling from ambien; usually take a small dose around 7 for the buzz and then a full dose 2 hours later for bed.

				but i should add there have been numerous studies showing the effectiveness of ketamine on depression. it works incredibly fast too. personally i find certain brands work better then others. i like the r-isomer personally but a lot of people like s. i think those studies are talking about using a dose and then not using it for several days. if you use k everyday on going things usually become very blurry and disoriented and physical health problems start.

				Ketamine&#039;s antidepressant effect is noticed when you&#039;re NOT high anymore. You take some K, trip for an hour, after that your depression is gone for a week or more, that&#039;s why ketamine is a great option, because you don&#039;t need to be under the influence of something all the time to be in a good mood. Using ketamine once a week isn&#039;t so bad for your health, considering that you don&#039;t need high doses to benefit from its antidepressant effects. It&#039;s certainly not as bad as effexor everyday.

				assuming it doesnt have some harmful cut or your not mixing it with something i doubt using k once or twice a week is harmful at all. the side effects i was mentioning were from people i know and my own experiences. they happened after chronic use. but i think it still has to be mentioned. in a perfect world a dose a week can be very helpful but as so many people find out, sometimes self medicating can lead to abuse lol i was just throwing it out there<br />ketamine can very seductive especially if your depressed.<br />i use 1 gram every 4 weeks and i find my mood is noticeably uplifted afterwards for about 1-2 weeks and i have minimal side effects but i did spend many years in a k-hole because it was easier then the real world :)

				I appreciate the input, truly! Benzos put me to sleep - at least .5 Xanax does, and that&#039;s the only one I&#039;ve had. I have enough pills here that I don&#039;t use to make killer money on SR&nbsp; &nbsp; lol
