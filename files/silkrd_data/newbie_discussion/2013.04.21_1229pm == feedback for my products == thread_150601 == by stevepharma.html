Wow what a generous sample and so he has definitely earned my business.<br /><br />Everybody here is just going crazy over these fresh as fuck xanax and V&#039;s. They had an expiration date of 2016!

				I got a free sample consisting of 10 Ambien and 20 Valium from Steve.<br />Shipping was free as well and really fast, only 3 working days! <br /><br />Steve&#039;s communication is very good, he replies fast and is friendly. There wasn&#039;t any real stealth but for a domestic pill order it&#039;s not very important. The package doesn&#039;t look suspicious from the outside though, the stuff just isn&#039;t hidden inside, which isn&#039;t that big of a deal.<br />Another downside is that he had no PGP at the time I ordered my sample but he started using PGP very soon after that, so this isn&#039;t of concern anymore.<br />The pills were good, I didn&#039;t notice a difference in potency between his pills and those coming from a US pharmacy (the pills were manufactured in another country, as pictured on his listings). <br /><br />All in all he&#039;s a very professional and flexible vendor, his sample was beyond generous, and he has the real deal with super fast shipping. Now that he has PGP I would definitely recommend him and order from him again!

				Wonderful Vender over all. <br /><br />Shipping was super fast <br />(it would have been here in two days, South East USA) I saw would have, See he shipped Express and it required a signature.. Well my Mail people are odd about Express mail and it added a week to my delivery having to chase them with slips.. I went to the post office to pick it up and was told it was out for delivery, Went home found another slip.. Signed they took it then next day then I waited a few more days.. Got another slip... Today a week+ I finally got my package NOT the venders fault!! My Mail peoples issue.. But when ordering from this vender going forward I will ask for Priority as I never have issues with it.. They just leave it on my porch or in the mail box when it fits. <br /><br />Items look on par from what I was getting from my local pharm when I had a script<br /><br />Great Communication across the board. He really wants to make sure you are getting your product and are happy!!<br /><br />I will give an up date after I have taken one. I got Ambien so I have to wait a few days till I can ensure I dont have to be up too soon for anything.. :) Friday maybe? :) <br /><br />Thank you again! Product review coming!!

				Ok.<br />Just remember that encouraging people to pay with WU/mg or similar outside silk road escrow system is not something to take lightly.<br />It is a shame letting newbies thinking it is a safe way to trade when there are may big safety risks (and fraud risk) involved.<br />Maybe this vendor isnt such a nice guy after all...

				Another 5/5 The only reason I did not finalize the day I got it was because I couldn&#039;t get on to SR the day I got it.<br /><br />Stealth could be improved, however, communication, shipping time, and product were top notch.<br /><br />Will be looking to do business with this vendor again.

				Product was delivered extremely fast. It came Express, overnight. One small thing that the vendor can work on. Don&#039;t just throw a bunch of blister paks into an empty Express envelope. Please wrap the product up first in a small bag or anything so if someone accidentally opens the Express envelope they won&#039;t know what the item is. I have had multiple Priority/Express envelopes open by accident but nothing ever happen to the contents since they were wrapped/packaged also. Thank you, will use vendor again.

				Full amount came..Fast..Ordered early morning Thursday, got Monday morning...They look real. Not sure what the Arabic writing is about on product. Maybe vendor could just explain that on fan page...Stealth could be better...<br />(just being honest)..First time with vendor and if product turns out good, I WILL BE BACK!

				StevePharma is by far one of the best vendor&#039;s I have ever done business with on SR. Best communication, shipping time, and product...I&#039;ve been an SR member for well over a year and this is the best experience I&#039;ve had with ANY vendor. This vendor knows how to treat his customers!

				Thank you so much! Arrived ride on time, and legit as can be, still in the blisters. Stealth was minimal and it would have been nice to have known what the class of mail was going to be (as the listing only says USPS), but it&#039;s really hard to say anything negative when I&#039;ve got all these little blue pills smiling placidly at me. :-) Also, steve&#039;s communication was kind.

				I&#039;ve only been posting my 5/5&#039;s in the normal feedback way, but I should probably post here too.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had the slightest problem with stevepharma&#039;s shipping, speed, or product.&nbsp; As people are mentioning stealth, I guess it&#039;s worthy of mention that in the past orders have been simply blisterpaks in an envelope, and I suppose that if someone took note of the sound, or if the envelope were to be damaged, this could be an issue.&nbsp; It hasn&#039;t ever been a problem with my orders, but according to his page, he&#039;s now using bubblemailers, which are probably better.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, as a relative newbie here on the Road, I don&#039;t have tons to compare with, but I really can&#039;t say enough good stuff about this vendor.&nbsp; When he says things are in transit, they are in transit.&nbsp; Stuff comes overnight.&nbsp; He is kind in his messages and understanding of the needs of those who order his kind of meds.&nbsp; He&#039;s really quite exceptional.&nbsp; And that&#039;s that.

				I wanted to leave my detailed feedback in the same timely manner SteveP attended to my order.&nbsp; I submitted order on a Wed am and to my (pleasant) surprise, was marked &#039;in transit&#039; in 36 minutes.&nbsp; From order submission to receipt at my door was a blistering 46 hrs. Considering I had not arranged nor paid for any form of speedy shipping, I was quite pleased as well as relieved. This was a new vendor for me and I&#039;m sure you all know the anxiety of waiting to see how it will all pan out with someone you have not put to the test before.&nbsp; I am happy to report all worked out well in my case!<br /><br />His page states he ships many products in blister packs and as such has shipped to a newer bubble envelope.&nbsp; I can confirm both of these statements are true.&nbsp; While the package was silent as postal worker walked it to my door and handed it over, knowing what it contained I did take it inside and give it a good healthy shake.&nbsp; Yes I could hear a small bit of rattling sounds from the tablets inside the blister packs.&nbsp; However if there are postal workers shaking packages like b-day gifts trying to ascertain the contents, I have to say the sounds could have equally been those of those little ball bearing labyrinth or pinball games.&nbsp; Or perhaps those movable tile puzzles where you try to complete an image or put numbers in order by manipulating the tiles.&nbsp; Basically any small plastic parts shipped would have produced the sounds by good shaking achieved.&nbsp; If the bubble would have been damaged or cut open, yes there would be no mistaking what was in the shipment (as some have left feedback they wished there was some doubling up of envelopes/packaging in some way).&nbsp; But I find that mail order pharmacy has become a huge option for many legitimate medication orders and on the surface I don&#039;t believe my particular meds would have raised to much attention while I know this is not true for all any many other types of shipments.&nbsp; I am no vendor nor stealth expert, but perhaps those of you stating concerns in this area can do some PMs with him with your suggestions.&nbsp; My hope that they would not slow down his incredible pace nor have much affect on his prices.<br /><br />I did make sure to consume some product immediately as to be able to include in this review.&nbsp; My order had 10 blister packs with 10 tablets each.&nbsp; Not one single tablet was broken, flaky, or damaged. Each looked brand new and were exactly as advertised. Expiration dates were 01/2017.&nbsp; Medication is working as expected, addressing symptoms and then some (I have been taking this product with scripts from pharmacies for about 4 years).&nbsp; I think a reviewer mentioned some foreign writing on part of the blister pack, I did see this as well but find his explanations of his standards of countries and companies he uses to be acceptable to me at least.&nbsp; And of course most of the pack was in a language I could read (English) and the foreign part took up only a small part of the entire packaging. <br /><br />So a big thank you to StevePharma!&nbsp; You have created a fan and in the future a repeat customer.&nbsp; Please keep up the speedy and honest (honest in the sense of the word toward your SR customers that is!) work and methods. Look forward to using your services again soon in the future!<br />DakotaAnn10
