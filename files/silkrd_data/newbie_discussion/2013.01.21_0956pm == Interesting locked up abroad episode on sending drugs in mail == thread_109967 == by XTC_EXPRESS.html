				Might be good knowledge for some of you:<br /><br /><br />http://documentarylovers.net/locked-up-abroad-party-girl/<br /><br />by the way these shows are great, im hooked, my favorite is &quot;hasidic king of coke&quot; great episode damn.<br />I&#039;ve always wondered why 90 % of these people busted are walking through airports with it, why not just fucking mail it?

				Man, that show gives me the heebie jeebies. I was actually just about to order from you, Mr. XTCEXPRESS, when I started having paranoid thoughts (I&#039;m in the USA) about intercepted mail and swat teams in the middle of the night. Customs is just one more hurdle I&#039;m not sure I feel comfortable with yet. I haven&#039;t watched the video yet, but surely it won&#039;t help assuage my concerns...

According to US postal inspectors:&nbsp; https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/radDocs/pubs/AnnualReportArchives.html<br /><br />For 2011, postal inspectors arrested 1,327 people...&nbsp; 1,102 convictions.<br />For 2010 (SR came into existence in 2011), postal inspectors arrested 1,322.&nbsp; (So just about the same amount)<br />For 2001.... 1,662 people were arrested for mailing drugs<br /><br />Imho I really don&#039;t think the smuggling game is changing much at all...&nbsp; if it were, the CIA would be pissed it&#039;s being cut out of the loop. :) I don&#039;t think we can compete with C130&#039;s, Ocean containers, etc... we&#039;re not even a drop in the bucket compared to means like those.&nbsp; &nbsp;And if it was... all coke vendors here would be from South America, heroin vendors would all be from SE Asia etc... but that&#039;s not what we have going on.<br /><br />I know shipping illicit substances in the mail may seem new to those that found SR, but It&#039;s not... I myself was having stuff sent to me long before SR ever came around.&nbsp; The way we network here though, well... that&#039;s a different story. <br /><br />And some other spit-balled numbers...<br /><br />~313 Million people in the US back in 2011. <br />Lets say 10% of them were illicit drug users (I think this number is higher)... that makes 31.3 Million drug users.<br />Now lets say 1% of all those druggies score by mail...&nbsp; that&#039;s 313,000 people<br />As per the the US postal inspectors; 1,327 arrests were made in 2011.... this equates to 0.42% of postal scoring drug users getting arrested.&nbsp; (0.35% convicted) <br />
