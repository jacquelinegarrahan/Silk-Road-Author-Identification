				Hey guys, I need to vent. After my first couple of transactions to dip my toe in the water so to speak, I can&#039;t seem to find a vendor that will ship when they say. I get stuff like...<br /><br />XXXX: As soon as you finalize I will ship.<br /><br />ME: Hi there, that&#039;s done. Thanks very much XXXX.<br /><br />2 weeks later...<br /><br />ME: Hi XXXX, sorry to hassle you but I still haven&#039;t received a delivery as yet. I haven&#039;t received a seizure notice or anything yet. What&#039;s the usual amount of time to deliver to xxxxx for you?The last 2 for me were 9 days. <br /><br />ME: Alright, I&#039;ve just read your page here and some in the forum. I admit, you got me good.<br />&quot;As soon as you finalize I will ship&quot;<br /><br />But the truth was......<br /><br />&quot;Now I will admit that over the past month I have stated that packages had shipped when they had not shipped yet, for this I apologize&quot;<br />You must being going through some shit to do this to people. Good luck with whatever it is XXXX.<br />Take care.<br /><br />XXXX: I understand your frustration, it is more than justified. If I wanted to &quot;get you good&quot; I would not still be here and not making an effort to make things right. Will you at least give me to opportunity to do that?<br />What was order and your address please?&nbsp; Your skepticism is warranted, but I promise you, I will make good on this.<br /><br />ME: Hi XXXX, let&#039;s be absolutely clear here, you did get me good. It&#039;s a transaction, I pay money and you ship the goods. I fulfilled my end, you didn&#039;t, simple.<br /><br />I&#039;m just here trying to find a few decent connections that I&#039;m able to build enough trust in to operate for as long as we both benefit. I&#039;ve quickly figured out that there is little risk for vendors on the site. It&#039;s the customer that pays their money up front and crucially provides a drop address. My problem with you is that I have to potentially lose this drop rather than expose another one. <br />I&#039;ll ask you directly for a favor please. Either send it this week or not at all. I can&#039;t keep the window open for this drop any longer than 2 weeks. Anything sent later isn&#039;t worth the risk to me. If nothing else I beg you to respect that. I&#039;ll cop it on the chin and move on. <br /><br />(I provided an address, it has been a month and nothing came. Ok, lesson learned.&nbsp; I did contact support as the vendor admitted in a message and also on his own profile that he hadn&#039;t sent packages but I didn&#039;t receive a response.)<br /><br />My next one I wasn&#039;t going to FE. I thought paying $150 for express 1 - 3 day delivery would help. That was 2 weeks ago. I was wrong. The vendor won&#039;t answer messages and his glowing feedback has changed to stuff like ... <br /><br />Fe as asked did not recieve tracking number and no replys to my msgs maybe i been scammed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />1 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never recieved and didnt recieve communication from vendor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order inexplicably canceled, but whatevs, not gonna hate on the guy.<br /><br />I don&#039;t get it, these guys never heard of repeat business? My thinking is they&#039;d make a lot more if they would actually just fill their orders. My point really is that what&#039;s to stop anyone just starting vendor accounts and running these scams for as long as they can? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Obviously the &quot;main culprit&quot; seems to be this &#039;FE&#039; business prior to shipment. I understand that sellers/vendors are needed for any service-based site to progress, and I understand that a good percentage of the items on offer here have an inherent risk involved as they could be considered illegal in many (if not all) countries - which, for me personally, is all the more reason to a. Always pay the extra monies (when necessary) for proper shipping with tracking, and b. Never FE while your hands are empty.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have to FE all my purchases and it seems like the only way to get delivery to Aus. I would suggest only buying from people with the highest feedback score. They typically want their score high so won&#039;t try rip you off as you can always leave bad feedback.
