				On the page instructing first time depositors, it says:<br /><br />&quot;Once you are ready, send your deposit to this address:&quot;<br /><br />Then nothing.&nbsp; It&#039;s blank.&nbsp; Am I missing something?

				No.&nbsp; My only lead is that the instruction page advises me to change my password and pin before making my first deposit.&nbsp; I just signed up, and I would rather not.&nbsp; Do I really have to do that before an address will appear?

				Just tried it now.&nbsp; Also, I tried to upload a screenshot of what I see, but the forum tells me my upload folder is full.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; The only thing in there is my avatar.

				Said the same thing for me. Just go to where it tells you to change your password after clicking the deposit thing under account, then it should be the address at the bottom where it says &quot;when you&#039;re ready, use this address to deposit.&quot; They must&#039;ve changed it recently because the guide I was using said something different too. Also, it&#039;s not in green, just plain text.

				Still the same for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check it again tomorrow.&nbsp; I can&#039;t be the only person with this problem.

				Bumping my thread from yesterday.&nbsp; Anyone at all have any idea why I can&#039;t seem to obtain my depositing address?&nbsp; I&#039;m using the Tor browser on Windows 7, as I&#039;m sure 99% of us are.<br /><br />&quot;Once you are ready, send your deposit to this address:&quot;<br /><br />Believe me, I would love to.&nbsp; By the time I figure this out, I might have 50 posts.
