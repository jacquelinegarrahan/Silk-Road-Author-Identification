				First of all hello everyone! I&#039;m very intrigued by the silk road and can&#039;t wait to start buying, but I have a question about bitcoin.&nbsp; If I&#039;m buying from a site like mtgox.com where I have to give them my personal info to buy coin, is that ok? Once I get the coin and transfer it to my account is there anyway I can be tracked down? I&#039;ve noticed that there are ways to completely anonymously buy coin, but is that necessary? Is buying coin from a site using your legit info safe enough?

				I don&#039;t fuss with MT GOX, they are too conformist and require way too much info and it just isn&#039;t easy enough for me.&nbsp; I just posted elsewhere that I think its easiest today to just make a temp wallet at blockchain.info and fund it direct through anonymous and fast (miutess from making the temp account to creating payment slip to filling out blue wal mart form sans ID to having bitcoin.&nbsp; I can usually have bitcoin in under 10 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Like I said it depends on where you live really as to what your options are.

				With new bitcoin casinos turning over millions of dollars - you have total plausible deniability for buying bitcoins. However, for someone to dig up your bank accounts because you ordered a few grams of weed/MDMA/ acid over the darkweb is going to take more paperwork than it&#039;s worth. Think about it...that&#039;s FBI level shit - and all for some kid who likes to listen to Black Sabbath while getting wasted...<br />Bitcoin is the least of your worries...
