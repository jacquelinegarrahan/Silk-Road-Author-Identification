				Title: <strong>Great LSD quotes..</strong><br />

				&quot;Of greatest significance to me has been the insight that I attained as a fundamental understanding from all of my LSD experiments: what one commonly takes as &#039;the reality,&#039; including the reality of one&#039;s own individual person, by no means signifies something fixed, but rather something that is ambiguous—that there is not only one, but that there are many realities, each comprising also a different consciousness of the ego. One can also arrive at this insight through scientific reflections. The problem of reality is and has been from time immemorial a central concern of philosophy. It is, however, a fundamental distinction, whether one approaches the problem of reality rationally, with the logical methods of philosophy, or if one obtrudes upon this problem emotionally, through an existential experience. The first planned LSD experiment was therefore so deeply moving and alarming, because everyday reality and the ego experiencing it, which I had until then considered to be the only reality, dissolved, and an unfamiliar ego experienced another, unfamiliar reality. The problem concerning the innermost self also appeared, which, itself unmoved, was able to record these external and internal transformations. Reality is inconceivable without an experiencing subject, without an ego. It is the product of the exterior world, of the sender and of a receiver, an ego in whose deepest self the emanations of the exterior world, registered by the antennae of the sense organs, become conscious. If one of the two is lacking, no reality happens, no radio music plays, the picture screen remains blank.&quot;<br />Albert Hofmann - LSD: My Problem Child, 1980

				Yep :)<br /><br />Here is another one:<br /><br />&quot;&#039;Turn on&#039; meant go within to activate your neural and genetic equipment. Become sensitive to the many and various levels of consciousness and the specific triggers that engage them. Drugs were one way to accomplish this end. &#039;Tune in&#039; meant interact harmoniously with the world around you—externalize, materialize, express your new internal perspectives. Drop out suggested an elective, selective, graceful process of detachment from involuntary or unconscious commitments. &#039;Drop Out&#039; meant self-reliance, a discovery of one&#039;s singularity, a commitment to mobility, choice, and change. Unhappily my explanations of this sequence of personal development were often misinterpreted to mean &#039;Get stoned and abandon all constructive activity.&#039;&quot;<br />Timothy Leary - Flashbacks, 1983

				This one is great too:<br /><br />&quot;Always that same LSD story, you&#039;ve all seen it. &#039;Young man on acid, thought he could fly, jumped out of a building. What a tragedy.&#039; What a dick! Fuck him, he’s an idiot. If he thought he could fly, why didn’t he take off on the ground first? Check it out. You don’t see ducks lined up to catch elevators to fly south—they fly from the ground, ya moron, quit ruining it for everybody. He’s a moron, he’s dead—good, we lost a moron, fuckin’ celebrate. Wow, I just felt the world get lighter. We lost a moron! I don’t mean to sound cold, or cruel, or vicious, but I am, so that’s the way it comes out. Professional help is being sought. How about a positive LSD story? Wouldn&#039;t that be news-worthy, just the once? To base your decision on information rather than scare tactics and superstition and lies? I think it would be news-worthy. &#039;Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we&#039;re the imagination of ourselves&#039; . . . &#039;Here&#039;s Tom with the weather.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />Bill Hicks

				Personally I don&#039;t like, and think that quotes from people while they were high (especially on LSD) are absolutely pointless and usually absurd to read or look into.<br /><br />I&#039;ve no doubt that peoples world views change dramatically after taking said drugs, but absolutely not something I would read about. I love SciFi and fantasy and reading, films and television and honestly it&#039;s just absurd to hear people&#039;s ridiculous thoughts and &quot;woah man&quot; while they were on X hallucinogen.
