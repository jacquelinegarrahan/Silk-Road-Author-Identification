				Does anyone have access to this research, suggested dosage, side effects (for those who do it recreationally what&#039;s it like?), etc. Would really like to know more about the research being done, I&#039;ve heard a lot of great results but doctors (and the FDA) won&#039;t touch it with a ten foot pole because it holds a similar stigmatism as weed (which we all know should be used for tons of medical ailments over there respective pills).

				I commend you interest in the research of anti depressants, but I dont think K is the way to go. Yes I do use it all the time, and esp when im down in the dumps, but its just a band aide. The soon as your back on earth, you realize, your stress and worries, have not gone any where =/<br /><br /><br />EDIT; Its a diss-associative, has no effect on brain chems and or balance of them. So it will not actually change anything in your brain, making you less miserable or depressed. What it will do , is have you float ever so gently to the moon and back. Which is great, but like i said, its a temporary fix for depression. I find that when im on a down swing of my manic depression, its wonderful for allowing me to let my mind rest and get some sleep. So a snap or three before bed is nice. But that only builds your tolerance very quickly. By the fourth or fifth day, youll need at least twice the amount you started with to get where you need to be. Good luck dude.

				This one isn&#039;t actually for me, but someone very close to me. I&#039;ve heard of drug trials showing success after a single low dose of K (pharma grade) having powerful effects on the chronically depressed for months. Allowing them to be weened off anti-depressants. There was an NPR report on it awhile back.

				doesn&#039;t Erowid have some info on this? <br /><br />I think there&#039;s been another post on the forum about this topic, <br />can&#039;t quite remember what the name was, but shouldn&#039;t be to hard to search for...

				I&#039;d like to float to the moon and back when I&#039;m down and out! I have never used K before, what is the recommended dose for first time users/recommended type? Keep in mind I don&#039;t want to get blasted, just happier.

				Ket is a anesthetic/tranquilizer/dissociative. Its been used in surgeries, and alike practices for animals and humans as well.<br /><br />A light dose would be prob around 10-30mg depending on weight. A usual dose for a user is around 50mg. Tolerance for this stuff builds very quickly. So 50mg may get you there one day, then&nbsp; the next it will have to be 80-100mg. <br /><br />&nbsp;Do some home work and you will not be disappointed with the effects. Unless your just not a downer kind of person.&nbsp; In which case im sure you wouldnt have much interest in this thread lol. Much love guys.

				Bluelight and Erowid are excellent resources for this kind of question.&nbsp; SWIM knows quite a bit about depression etc having formerly been educated on this and does not recommend looking for a silver bullet to cure this kind of issue.&nbsp; Look for the core reasons for the depression first and identify if it is situational, seasonal or a lifelong issue then begin to research from there.&nbsp; GL!
