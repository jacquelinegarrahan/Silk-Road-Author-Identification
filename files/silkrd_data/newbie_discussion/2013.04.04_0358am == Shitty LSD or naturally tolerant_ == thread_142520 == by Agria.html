				I recently ordered 5 hits of &quot;potent and clean LSD&quot; from a reputable vendor. Last night I consumed one tab, waited about an hour and a half, and finally started feeling it. It was extremely weak and felt very similar to a low dose of 2C-B. Some giggling here and there, but no visuals and no mind fuck. This was my very first time trying LSD so I really don&#039;t know what I should be looking for or if I&#039;m expecting too much.<br /><br />Do you think it was shitty LSD or could I just be naturally tolerant? Could I try again tonight with two tabs instead? Should I message the vendor? <br /><br />Thanks for your help :)

				I&#039;d say try again on an empty stomach, particularly avoid acidic foods like fruits and orange juice.

				There have been reports on the Avenger&#039;s forum about Tess&#039;s recent batch being particularly weak. Have you finalized already? Either way, I would bring it to his attention and see what he says. There is a good chance it wasn&#039;t your tolerance.

				If your on certain meds that can effect it, but I have read that Tess&#039;s recent batch was weak as well.

				I&#039;d bet that&#039;s shitty LSD. <br />Try to take 3 in a week and see.

				you&#039;re better off trying 3, I had 2 of the same tabs and I had a decent trip but nothing special like all the other reviewers have mentioned.&nbsp;

				There have been a small amount of reports coming in that his blotters might be uneven or lower dosed.&nbsp; You should always message the vendor first and see what the resolution is.&nbsp; Good luck.<br /><br />Pink Floyd - Echoes

				Thank you everyone for your help :)<br /><br />I tried again with two tabs instead of one and couldn&#039;t feel a thing so I&#039;m definitely thinking they&#039;re unevenly dosed. I&#039;ll message the vendor and see what he says.

				subbed..<br /><br />I&#039;ve been interested in buying from Tess.&nbsp; They seem relatively overpriced, but every review I&#039;ve read&nbsp; has been positive (other than this thread, those reviews may have been before this recent batch)<br /><br />I&#039;ll also say that if you are taking certain drugs including antidepressants/SSRI&#039;s or Molly or Psilocybin recently that can reduce tolerance, from what I read in Dr. James Fadiman&#039;s book &quot;The Psychedelic Explorer&#039;s Guide&quot;.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; Please keep us updated with how you get this resolved, because I&#039;m still interested in ordering from Tess, but leaning more toward Hollandonline

				I&#039;ve ordered from Alberthoffman1943 3 times, and this guys legit. Me and 6 others have tried it including two first timers, all good things have been said. fast stealthy shipping, very clean felt super happy. HIGHLY recommend here. prices a bit steep, but well worth it
