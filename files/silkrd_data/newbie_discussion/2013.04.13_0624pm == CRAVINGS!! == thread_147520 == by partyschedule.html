				Asking for any advice on Heroin cravings, or to just take my mind off shooting up.<br /><br />In a predicament where I have to drop lab-UA&#039;s frequently.<br /><br />Any other substances that would take my mind off Heroin? I&#039;ve been clean for a few months, and still have strong cravings.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking psych&#039;s would help a lot, (LSD, DMT, MUSHROOMS), as they wouldn&#039;t show up in UA&#039;s, but I&#039;m open for suggestions!<br /><br />&lt;3

				after quitting ops a couple times caffeine became my drug of choice, didn&#039;t help the wd&#039;s tho. i found the only thing that helped was mentally knowing i did not want to use anymore, atleast for that time being, ultimately it failed in the long run

				Thanks guys! Good looking out.<br /><br />I&#039;ve experimented with Kratom before, and it just didn&#039;t do much for me. Actually didn&#039;t feel anything at all..<br /><br />Maybe it was just a bad supplier?&nbsp; &#039;kratomKing&#039; or something.. a clearnet source.<br /><br /><br />I know I&#039;m late to respond, but if any of you read this, what&#039;s the best dosage? Do you have to spend a whole lot on it? I&#039;m not trying to spend as much as I do on Heroin, but just to take away the edginess/thinking I can shoot up just once feeling.<br /><br />Again thanks for the support. Very much appreciated!<br />

				i have heard from a few peeps to try pregabalin it&#039;s often prescribed for neuropathic pain or generalised anxiety disorder, but have read a few places that it can help with detox<br /><br />psychedelics might help but i don&#039;t know if you&#039;d have the best trip withdrawing<br /><br />benzos, bupe, meth but in a way it&#039;s compounding the problem<br /><br />anti histamines like promethazine and hydroxyzine would probably help with some of the physical side effects and might take the edge off without being particularly addictive in themselves<br /><br />ibogaine and ayhuasca i would definitely imagine help though

				Aww! Thanks, manik :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve been clean and without physical withdrawals for a few months now, and it&#039;s necessary for me to drop lab-UA&#039;s frequently to keep my freedom. I&#039;m thinking psych&#039;s would give me a better sense of well-being.<br /><br />I&#039;m worried about anything else showing up in a UA..?

				well anything prescription i shouldn&#039;t imagine being a problem being in urine analysis<br /><br />i highly doubt they check for obscure psychedelics like dmt and mescaline, dmt especially is present in every persons body so i&#039;d imagine they&#039;d have a tough time proving it was taken illicitly

				Suboxone will stop the cravings but it is an opiate in itself so you are just trading one addiction for another.&nbsp; However, the subs are a lot easier to quit than the H.&nbsp; If you end up trying out Suboxone, start out with the lowest possible dose that you can tolerate.&nbsp; A lot of Dr&#039;s prescribe 2 x 8mg films to start out.&nbsp; If your H habit is not that bad then I would try to start out with like 4mg or even the 2mg film.&nbsp; You have to taper down in very small doses also.&nbsp; When I quit Subs, at the end I was only taking 1/16th of a 2mg film or .125mg.&nbsp; Wellbutrin also seems to help a little bit.&nbsp; If you want more info about the subs just send me a message.&nbsp;

				S/he said s/he was clean!<br /><br />I found that the intense cravings just wear off over time. Can take a long time but every day, hour minute you don&#039;t succumb you are making yourself stronger and the cravings less.<br /><br />As for taking your mind off the cravings whilst staying clean for a piss test... it depends what they are testing for. Persoanly I would steer clear of hallucinogens as that would be too risky.<br /><br />It&#039;s a cliche but exercise works.<br /><br />Never tried kratom, heard good things about it.<br /><br />All the best

It might suck for now but in the long run you will feel way better. I did Cocaine heavily for 3 months and had a very difficult time to quit, so I started using Ketamine heavily because I justified it as &quot;not being cocaine.&quot; <br /><br />What I&#039;m trying to say is it&#039;s not a good idea to take another drug, so you don&#039;t feel the WDs or cravings for another drug. I&#039;ve heard of people on some forum boards that I frequent who get WDs from Kratom as well. If you do want to do something, smoke some weed but if you don&#039;t feel that&#039;s enough....<br /><br />I&#039;d say go for a heavy psychedelic experience, with something like DMT. OR If you are feeling ballsy, go for an Ibogaine experience.<br /><br />I do realize I just said don&#039;t use drugs so you don&#039;t feel WDs or Cravings for another drug, but if you&#039;re going to do something, I&#039;d suggested the above.

You don&#039;t have to full out exercise. Get a craving, pump out a couple 10/20 sit ups, if you have a bench or even a curl bar. Bust out a couple reps. Specially if you are pissing for a PO. You do not wanna be doin them fuckers in the &#039;yard&#039; during your 30 mins of outdoors time. =)
