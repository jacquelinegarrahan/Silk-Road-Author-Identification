				So I am about to buy myself this machine:<br />http://store.apple.com/us/product/FD102LL/A/refurbished-macbook-pro-29ghz-dual-core-intel-i7<br /><br />I hope to run my future vendor account off of this computer. Also I plan on running this machine for games.<br /><br />Unfortunelty I am very new to most of this tech so I need to get as many opinions on this as possible. <br />First off I want to ask if it is possible to run tails on this machine? Or something similar. What is my best bet for 100% security or who should I speak with.<br />I remember an older member guru was an expert on security having to do with macs. If only he was still around.<br />I asked pine months ago for help, but it seemed he/she didn&#039;t know macs to well.<br />Any help is appreciated on this.<br /><br />Also, for anyone who is into first person shooters, such as myself, will this be a good machine to run a setup out of. <br />Thanks everyone

				Gamer Laptops are usually 200% as expensive as a normal PC for the same hardware.<br /><br />I am not experienced with macbooks but am almost certain that this is not what you are looking into playing halfway recent FPS.<br />First of all, as far as I know, you&#039;ll need to run a VM just to play the games and second of all the GPU won&#039;t handle the games too well.<br />Are you sure you want a gaming laptop? Why not buy a PC for your gaming needs?<br />If you are really looking into buying a gaming laptop you should consider windows based custom made laptops and I am not talking Alienware where you will be paying extra just for the name.<br />Look into names such as XMG or any company that uses Clevo cases.<br />Those things get really hot though and are really expensive.

				Unless you absolutely need a portable gaming machine, you are way better off building a nice desktop gaming box, and then getting a decently cheap laptop for SR and other activity you want to keep separate.&nbsp; This makes data organization a piece of cake, increases general security and all-important separation of identities, and will probably cost about the same as a nice gaming laptop anyway.

				tails is vastly overrated. just build a pc and put linux on it and go from there to make it secure. with the money you will save you will be able buy a nice graphics card for your games. a low spec refurbished macbook is the worst choice for gaming.

				Just to focus on the security for the vendor part. I have decided on purchasing a MacBook Air 2012 model with 4gb ram. This computer will only be for the road and other minor tasks. I plan on getting a whole separate computer for gaming.<br /><br />I need to be overly secure about this. I want there to be no chance of police getting into my computer if ever confiscated. Is the FileVault system secure? What should I do to fully secure the computer and encrypt it to full safety. <br />Also is there a way I can boot from a USB even though it is Mac? Anyone have experience with libirte for Mac?

				I probably wouldn&#039;t buy a macbook for gaming at all. <br />Its also probably not that bright an idea to be doing your personal activities and running a vendor account on the same machine but that may just be me.<br /><br />As for tails, I&#039;m sitting here on tails running through the very same machine you listed. There are some things you can&#039;t do like set up a persistent volume but that is due to be fixed in the next release. It also pretty much forces you to run from a live disc rather that a USB drive. this sounds like it suck but if you use a non-rewriteable DVD it&#039;s more secure as nothing can maliciously write to your live disk (like say a trojan or keylogger for example) <br /><br />I would probably follow the advice above though, build an SR specific machine and use a secure disti of linux like liberte or tails if you want too. Tails is nice because its very user-friendly but, as you can see, it has some detractors <br /><br />Hope this helps, <br /><br />Annex

				depending on how paranoid you are, and how badly the police might be trying to view your data, I wouldn&#039;t go for anything with SSD (solid state drive) as its very difficult to truely erase everything, even if you write over it. have a look for yourself if you don&#039;t believe me <br /><br />http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/02/20/ssds-prove-difficult-to-securely-erase/<br /><br />Ideally, you would have a small cheap laptop that you bought second hand and don&#039;t mind having to ditch.

				tails will run off your macbook air using a USB but you have to manually put it on a USB and get a patched EFI. I&#039;m ssuming from this post that that really isn&#039;t something that you will be able to do. do yourself a favour and buy two separate machines.<br /><br />Also, you&#039;re geocoded at all times with your hotspot so I&#039;d be careful what I view :)
