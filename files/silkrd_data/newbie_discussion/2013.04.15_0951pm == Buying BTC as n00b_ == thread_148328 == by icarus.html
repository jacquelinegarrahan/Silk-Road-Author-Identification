				Hey, I&#039;m fairly new to SR, just been browsing so far but would like to become a more &quot;active&quot; participant. The thing is, I don&#039;t have a clue how to get Bitcoins.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read the &quot;how to&#039;s&quot; and know lots of people use cash deposits to bitfloor through bank of america, but that isn&#039;t an option for me. I live in a small city with only a couple different banks, and neither appear to offer that service.<br /><br />SO the question is, if I need to anonymously obtain bitcoins and I can&#039;t do it through cash deposit to bitfloor, how can I accomplish this?<br /><br />Any help is appreciated!

				I will tell you one of things I do to get BTC thats easy. Getting it into your SR account is easy from there but I dont know about how safe it is to send them straight over.<br />http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#bitcoin-otc&nbsp; is a chat room where you can find reputable sellers that will take all different forms of payment like Paypal or Green Dot Money Paks or bank deposits. I can recommend +c4pt as being very trustworthy. Look into it yourself and make your own decisions but there are people there who can help you. I dont mention SR over there. Just Bitcoin talk but thats just me.

				hey mate i know a good place to buy bitcoins online if your from the Uk very simple and you can pay via bank transfer. As to anonymous its not the best but easily done and ive never had any problems. You can have bitcoins in your SR wallet in 2hours from start to finish of buying them. <br /><br />Let me know if you need the link

You know I love popping cherries on Silk Road forums lol ;) )<br /><br />It depends a little on where you live. If you live in a small town and not a city or large town, you absolutely need to be careful about buying bitcoins, but you really do anyway regardless of where you live. Any bitcoin transaction used expressly for Silk Road should not involve banks. It wasn&#039;t too bad last year but it is becoming increasingly foolish to continue this practice, and there is increasing wisdom in using a certified Silk Road bitcoin vendor to cut this paper trail out. I feel I shouldn&#039;t need to say this. It&#039;s just common sense. I can understand someone new on The Road doing this though, the excitement is too much!! :D But don&#039;t keep doing htis again and agian and again, and expect not the nosy little bank manager to authorise an investigation. <br /><br />Common sense when buying comes with experience. You can tell something is up almost straight away with a sus listing. LE can buy vendor&#039;s acc./s just as easily as we can. Requiring a signature for a package is so obvious that not many vendors do this any more. It stands out like a prostitute in a convent. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I use Bitinstant&nbsp; you can make a cash deposit at places like CVS , Walmart or 7-11 .. all pretty common even in small towns.. <br /><br />You can have them put Bit coins right into a wallet address or an exchange account what ever way best works for you..

				The excitement is strong but the desire to be able to enjoy the fruits of what it IS that excites you and not fruit in jail safety/security has to come first. What is the saying? Follow the money. There are multiple ways to get BTC but to get it into SR you need to know how to do it safely. <br />Razorspyne wouldnt that be entrapment if LE setup a vendors account? Then again what is it when an undercover narco sells stuff? Its a curious subject. What are your thoughts? Also you mention suspicious ads that could be LE. What signs do you look for? I will only purchase from a vendor that has feedback meaning (to me) people are getting their items. Would this be a good way to &quot;weed&quot; LE out? I wont sign for anything myself. I also dont order anything I cant afford to lose. I see signatures required on the large orders mostly.

				If you can&#039;t do a cash deposit you can always do a wire xfer to the account they list from another bank. It takes a couple days but works no problem, and depending on the amount you want to buy it may be cheaper. <br /><br />With BTC being an investment outside of just for SR lately I think buying them is a whole lot less sketchy. <br /><br />It would seem that you would have a bank of some sort that one of the exchanges linked with, or you have a CVS, Walmart, etc. and can do a deposit onto bitinstant, although a lot of people have lost money there...

You could not legitimately claim that police used duress in any stage of you buying from them b/c you did so willingly and as part of a well-established routine. So no, not really. <br /><br />As to suspicious ads, I can&#039;t really give details of that, even over PM or TorMail, for the obvious reason that anyone and I mean anyone could be LE. That includes you, lol. :P After you&#039;ve been here a bit people start to open up to you but by then you already have those answers lol! Same reason why we never talk about money laundering or hiding places for stash. Sounds like a good idea to discuss it, until you think about it for a second, and about leaving a lot of really good, detailed info on Main for anyone to look at. But generally if someone leaves no other option but to sign... well... That&#039;s really common knowledge. I like when a vendor has a forum acc./ to correspond with their SR acc./ and can manage to be vouched for by forum members. Some people build up a reputation buying on SR for a while, then join the forums, then become a vendor. These are the best kind of vendors to buy from. It is hard for LE to remain here a long while under scrutiny without someone noticing something. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148328.msg1020576#msg1020576">Quote from: super-silk-woman on April 16, 2013, 07:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I will only purchase from a vendor that has feedback meaning (to me) people are getting their items.

If FB is being left on a vendor&#039;s page it could mean people are getting their packages (although there are 2 ways around this). It could also mean that LE are either letting newer buyers off in favour of building evidence of longer users, or that they are building and improving evidence on the orders they let go. Which, I guess, amounts to the same thing.<br /><br />Buying from established vendors is a good idea until someone is experienced enough to pick up on suspicious components on a vendor&#039;s page. They&#039;re obvious to me but not to a first time user. Practice makes perfect. You get better at it over time. <br /><br />Sorry I can&#039;t give you signs that I look for. (Often I don&#039;t even have to look, they just jump out at me.) You get that.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				maybe others have posted similar,same or even better solutions, but here&#039;s what I know to work and what seems easy and good to me:<br /><br />make an account on www.bitstamp.net , click Deposit and select method (I use international bank wire transfer,&nbsp; easy and fast), select amount of euro/dollar to send them and click Send. <br />Then they give you their bank details,&nbsp; account number etc., and a message you include when you send the money which includes your unique account ID.<br /><br />Wait a day or two after sending wire and it should have arrived, and the Bitstamp account has been credited so your account has a dollar/euro balance.&nbsp; Now you can click&nbsp; &quot;Buy bitcoins&quot;,&nbsp; I usually do it the simple and default way which is just entering the amount of dollar I wish to buy bitcoins for, and it buys bitcoins at market value until that amount has been spent,&nbsp; this process is usually done in a minute from you click Buy.<br />Then the balance in the account shows the Bitcoin you just bought.<br />Now those bitcoins can be withdrawn to the Silk Road bitcoin address that is listed under &#039;Account&#039;, and after sending bitcoin from Bitstamp to Silk Road it usually takes an hour or few until your Silk Road account has been credited and you are ready to spend the funds on drugs.<br /><br />Maybe not the safest or otherwise best method but, what Ive been using for over a year now I think, many times and has never failed me yet.&nbsp; Also I dont think your real name is required, as I have set up transfer from foreign bank accounts sent from other names, they just included the &#039;Message&#039; with the transfer so Bitstamp knew to credit my account, and I always got the money.<br /><br /><br /><br />in short just setup an account with bitstamp.net and click to create a deposit, send the funds according to the details they gave on the deposit page.&nbsp; then short wait before the cash is in ur account which u can buy bitcoin with, which u can then choose to withdraw to your Silk Road bitcoin address, which should have your account credited within a few hours and ready to start spending.&nbsp; <br />select a drug off the menu and enter the address to have it delivered to,enter pin and click Send.. lil more waiting and dinner is served!

				Razorspyne that makes sense about entrapment I didnt know those details. I know what you are saying about that &quot;sense&quot; for LE and bad situations in general online. Its a combination of street smarts and online street smarts. Its from trial and error over years. Its getting busted and learning from it enough to not to get busted again. Getting ripped off and learning from that and all kinds of other experiences online and off. I learned a long time ago to pay attention to everything I do online. What I write stays there for a long long time. Trails and paths of where ive been and what I do. Its about being conscious of what youre doing. People are all to eager to leave their name and email all over the internet (like a footprint). To let everyone know who they are what they like and what they do. As well as where they are or have been. Think about Facebook, Ebay and Twitter to name a few as well as all these forums and blogs out there. Who needs big brother we tell on ourselves. I have none of these things and do none of them as much as possible. This is the only forum that I NEED to have. I lie without lying in everything I do online. Its easy enough. Why do you need an email with your real name? Its going to be my primary email and im not scamming so why not make it anonymous? If I have a car I will write I took the bus. I still got there. Yesterday was last week and the cat is a dog. It was still a day and I still have a pet. Its enough to get my point across but if anyone was to ever put it all together it wouldnt be me. Im always learning more though and one can never be TOO cautious in my opinion. Maybe other newbies will read this and think about what they are writing a little more.

				so I just bought a couple coins from bitinstant via moneygram and was sketched a little when they asked for my ID and real address\phone #\info. I sent the coins over to a blockchain wallet and have not credited my SR account, but is there any way if I add them to my SR account they can be traced back to my real info?? I&#039;m placing a small first order so I&#039;m not terribly worried about being set up but for the sake of being as safe as humanly possible, is there a better way to get coins quickly and anonymously?
