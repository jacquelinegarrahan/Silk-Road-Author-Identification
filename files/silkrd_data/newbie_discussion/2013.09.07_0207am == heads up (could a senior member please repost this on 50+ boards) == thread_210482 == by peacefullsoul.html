				just voicing a little concern..there is a synthesis sold on here that is claimed to be safe for newbs etc by a man who sells consulting..i agree most of it is safe and in most peoples opinion it prob is but hydroxylamine hydrochloride goes bang big time..Some was being synthd by the under pressure method..when it went bang..<br /><br />scenario<br />large pot full of cooking oil with 9 300ml bottles in it..normally heat is gently bought up to desired range over a few hours but this time someone was in a hurry so they just cranked the hotplate to where its guna end up..now this person doesnt trust digital displays so an analogue thermometer is always run in the oil as a secondary and for a true reading..everything was going well then noticed that even tho the digital said 100 the analogue started climbing as tho the solution vessels had gone exothermic?? or the hotplate malfunctioned??..anyway hotplate was turned off but temp of oil kept rising.. then fckn boom&nbsp; and i mean boom.. had it not been for the wearing of respirator and glasses&nbsp; (always wear a min of glasses and put the respirator on when things didnt look right) you prob wldnt be reading this.. please do this outside and dont become complacent and lose respect for the reaction like someone else did..peaceout&nbsp; &nbsp;

				You are a fucking idiot.<br /><br />It&#039;s not his fault that your equipment malfunctioned. You should have removed the pot from the heat source. You should have covered the oil to stop a fresh supply of oxygen allowing it to combust.<br /><br />Making drugs is sometimes dangerous kids.

				hallucinating horse thanks for the insult ,if i wanted to be insulted id tell my mrs to get off her ass and go for a run .I dont see any of your information as being relevant, could you please explain to me a bulletproof way of doing this reaction as you seem to know all .. no one was blamed nor was there any mention of making drugs There are many uses for hh but i have seen mention of people wanting to make their own for that synth. and im not completly sure it was an equipment malfunction .It wasnt the oil that combusted..like i said the hotplate was turned off (at the wall) but the internal heat kept rising .Im not going to banter back and forward with you as i see it as a waste of energy, I just dont want too see any1 get hurt. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				It doesn&#039;t strike me as idiotic to be looking out for peoples safety.<br /><br />He pointed out that it is advertised as &#039;Safe for Newbs&quot;<br /><br />If shit can blow up that easily it probably isn&#039;t that safe for people with little to no experience.<br /><br />

				yip ..i think you can see the prob as well..like i said complacency and lost respect for the reaction..its not cool when its raining hcl from the roof and you wake up the next morn all itchy and rashy, and shit,yet alone explaining to ure mrs why theres glass embeded in the wall, which is why i dont want it too happen to any1 else.. I know i fckd up man and calling me an idiot doesnt make me feel any better..anything under pressure is dodgy i should have tread more carefully but it wasnt my finest hour.

				nah was just shortening muriatic acid..61grams of nitro-methane added to 114 grams of muriatic acid and then heated to 100c under pressure until homog x9 ..the caps are made of metal and they have a perforation around the lid(im guessing its a safety feature to release pressure so the glass doesnt explode)that was my warning bell.the first 1 hissed gas at me at 102c-104c? which ment i cldnt get near it to take it off the hotplate or i would have put the pot in the sink of cold water i had on standby.It was trying to hiss itself out dry but then the next 3-4 blew the top of the lids off but the thread was still on the bottle..the remainders all went with 1 last bang.my only saving grace was that i was complacent not lazy so my respirator was on hand the straps wernt pulled tight so i had to run out the room and adjust them cause i was gettin a little gas in thru the sides..by the time the last bang i rckn 2 -3 breaths in any room in the house wlda had you fckd because went i went outside to try and regather myself i took my mask off and it was unbearable within 10 feet of the backdoor..this is 1am in the morning in suburbia but everything is always packed in plastic bins and ready to go so within 3min the cars loaded and gone .its not illegal in my country to make hh. what im tryin to get at though is this would be alot safer outside because you dont have to try and resolve the prob u can just let it do its thing rather than watch ure house go to shit.which gives u impulses to try and fuck with it which wld result in pain..im just tryin to make people aware that this reaction can go to shit and real fast.. you hit the nail on the head though slow as you go
