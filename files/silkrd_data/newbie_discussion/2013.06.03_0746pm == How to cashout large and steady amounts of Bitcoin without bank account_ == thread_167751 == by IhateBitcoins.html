				Hello all <br /><br />I really hate Bitcoin - it&#039;s not anonymous, it&#039;s easilly tracable, exchangers are being leaned on by the feds hard right now,&nbsp; and the only form of cashout seems to be bank transfer, or localbitcoins.&nbsp; It seems to me this is a system designed to get and keep Bitcoins in it, not to help you get cash out of it. <br /><br />With that said, I&#039;m a long time Liberty Reserve and before that e-gold user that does 100% of business in e-currency, and with LR now gone and the alternatives not being great (such as PM) I am forced by my customers to accept Bitcoin<br /><br />So, I have come here looking for some advice from Bitcoin experts on how to stay anonymous when cashing out!<br /><br />I understand laundering coins, and whatnot, but my hang up is how to get large and regular amounts back to cash money without opening 100 bank accounts using fake IDs.&nbsp; I do not understand how any of you are using real bank accounts and staying safe from the law, and from the tax man, other than counting on the fact that e-currency is still not well understood and just doing it anyway.&nbsp; But as that will no longer be the case in the immediate future, staying safe and anonymous is absolutely paramount.<br /><br />So, does anyone have a method, or advice on moving funds out of bitcoin without a trail?<br /><br />IE:&nbsp; Western Union and Moneygram transfer + fake id,&nbsp; Offshore accounts with anonymous debit cards,&nbsp; Bitcoin loadable debit cards etc.<br /><br />Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated!
