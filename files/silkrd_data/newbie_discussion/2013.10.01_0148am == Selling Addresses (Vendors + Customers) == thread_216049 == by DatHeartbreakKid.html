				Selling addresses of vendors + customers that bought $10,000+<br /><br />So far I have smokeables address and Rxking&#039;s, I&#039;ll take BTC or LTC as payment, $3500 for smokeables, and $5000-$10,000 for Rxking&#039;s. I can verify that these are real addresses before you buy them. I also have 100+ people who&#039;ve spent $10,000+ addresses, selling these for $500 each. Add me on Skype @ DatHearbreakKid<br /><br />I&#039;ll be giving the first two people Smokeables address for free so I will be able to verify that I am legit. He lives 30 minutes away from me.

				You&#039;re an idiot.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you got so many customer addresses, or what anyone would do with them, but theres much better things you can do with them than just sell them.<br /><br />
