				First, let me say, I&#039;ve only been aware of bitcoins for approximately 4 days. However, in those 4 days I&#039;ve witnessed a tenfold increase against the Euro. From €46 per BTC to now over €56 per BTC. <br /><br />As a new member I am obviously curious as to whether the price fluctuates regularly on SR in line with the current market? <br /><br />BTC is in a really steep incline so I&#039;d imagine if you purchased something this week for 3 BTC and that was equivalent to €150, next week the same price of 3 BTC might cost you €200. <br /><br />Similarly it could cost less and the sellers would need to increase the BTC price - however, there does not appear to be a decline in the BTC whatsoever. It is in constant and very steep incline.

				I found an answer to my question in another thread. <br /><br />On the face of it, we see BTC as our currency - or our price if you will. The vendors actually specify their price in USD however, and the BTC price that we see fluctuates with the market. <br /><br />Therefore, the price is always the same. Now I feel like I&#039;m getting somewhere :)<br /><br />

				No thats not how it works as bitcoins rise then the amount we ask for our stuff falls so if something cost you £150 today and BTC keeps going up and you want said thing again it will still be £150<br />Hope this helps my page if you watch it you will see the btc asking prices go up and down&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0319a1315a
