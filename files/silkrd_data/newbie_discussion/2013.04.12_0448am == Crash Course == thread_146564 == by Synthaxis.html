				Hey Everyone! I just got alll this new information dumped in my lap and mind today, and am needless to say very excited. Ive gone through and researched as much as i can handle regarding bitcoins, approved sites, SilkRoad services and ofocurse these forums. Now i would like to get a couple of straight answers please....<br />I plan on going through bitfloor.com (it seems reliable and has good feedback) and need to know how to do that exactly.<br /><br />1.So how can i get bitpoints through Bitfloor?<br /><br />2.How can i then send them to the SilkRoad?<br /><br />3.And WTF is a PGP and how and why do i use it?<br /><br />Please and thank you for any and all comments for im totally lost here...<br />

				1. Make an account on Bitfloor.com, then make a deposit request and they will give you all the information you need. You will be making a cash deposit at BoA. It&#039;s bitcoin, by the way. ;)<br /><br />2. Your money will likely be in your Bitfloor account by the time you get home. You can then trade it for BTC, which you will be able to send to your SR address. You will use the withdraw option on Bitfloor after you have gotten BTC. Your SR address is located under &quot;account&quot; on the SR homepage.<br /><br />3. PGP is used to encrypt your address and any other sensitive information during your communication with vendors.&nbsp; You can find a tutorial and download link here:&nbsp; http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/

				Also there are online services such as http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGcrypt.htm<br />If you&#039;ve no paranoia, it could be used for PGP instead of more complex (and more secure) software.

				I would suggest Bitinstant. Its fast, you can use cash at walmart and use a fake name and info too. They dont ask for ID there. You can have it deposited directly into your sr bitcoin address on your account page. Just be sure the phone number and other info you put through bitinstant matches the one you put on a moneygram.<br /><br />PGP is pretty easy once your figure it out and there are plenty of tutorials on youtube that will help. Basically, you create a PGP account with a software such as GPA. Import someones public key (usually on their page) and you can then use that key to encrypt a message that only they can decrypt to read.<br /><br />If you want them to send you encrypted info, they will need your public key. They will use it to encrypt a message ony you can decrypt ( looks similar to the garbled text of a public key). They send it to you, and you decrypt it using your passphrase that you created through your PGP software.<br />Have a polite day.

				If you care to stay safe and secure, 1) Read the Wiki 2) read up on the security forum<br />SR has serious risks if you aren&#039;t careful. You are fucking up if you don&#039;t know what you are doing, which sounds to be the case.

				Everyone has already said what you need to do. BUT i would strongly recommend not purchasing any bitcoins or making any orders until the bitcoin market and SR recover and stabilize from the crash. Lurk a little more, get more familiar with the site, learn how to protect yourself and then once you really know the ins and outs then go ahead and make a purchase. Otherwise you might have a terrible first experience.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the advice guys! I hear that bitinstant isnt that reliable tho.... I even called down to my local walmart asking about moneygram orders and they had NO idea what i was talking about. Part of me is thinking about going with mtgox just cause...
