				I am considering offering high volume dxm powder at prices that are cheaper than buying cough syrup / robogels from the grocery store.&nbsp; The price could be as low as $5-7 usd/gram depending on the way the numbers work out.&nbsp; Once I get the shipping situation figured out, I figure I could be up and running in 2 weeks.&nbsp; For some reason I&#039;d like to retain my anonymity even though selling dxm isn&#039;t explicitly illegal.&nbsp; Ideally I&#039;d like to mail small amounts out in standard letters with bogus return addresses dropped off in blue boxes far from my home to remain anonymous, I don&#039;t see how I could retain my anonymity going to the post office because there are very few within normal driving distance and I would be using a BS return address. Forgot to mention, USA domestic only.<br /><br />Do you think I could even recoup the vendor deposit?&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />Also, this whole 50 posts newbie thing is annoying...&nbsp; ::)

				Yes, there would certainly be a market for it. DXM is a pretty popular drug and I am sure there are people who would appreciate not having to drink a ton of syrup or take a bunch of gel caps to get it.

				There might be a market for it. Define &quot;bulk&quot;. <br /><br />A few times a year I get a hankering for some DXM and don&#039;t act on it because current OTC products blow compared to powder. 3-5 grams at that price and some good feedback...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Pure DXM would be kick ass. Drinking robo absolutely sucks. DXM is a highly underrated psychedelic tool, it&#039;s written off as teenage recreation but with the right approach and dosage it can be extremely interesting to psychonauts.

				There is a market for any drug out there - how big of a market is another question.&nbsp; With all the better Dissociatives out there now that are more prevalent like K and MXE, I would assume the market would be on the smaller side.&nbsp; The risk of adverse side effects is also much larger on DXM.

				In high school a hundred some odd years back .I used to boil down Sucrets.The dxm floated up and then Id filter it, dry it, and I sold it by the gram.You could snort 6 inch long rails of it,and because of the menthol from the cough drops no burn.I called it Spacecoke.
