				I hate to break it to you, but there is no magic answer. It&#039;s going to depend what is available to you in your region. There are lots of bitcoin exchanges in operation now.<br /><br />The idea though, is to purchase your bitcoins in a way that does not require your identity to be verified / revealed.<br /><br />You then access your bitcoin exchange account using a VPN / Tor (and preferably do it all at a public WiFi) so that you cannot be linked to the bitcoin exchange account with an IP address. Since your identity has never been attached to your bitcoins, and SR has a coin tumbler built in, you can now send your bitcoins straight from your bitcoin exchange account to your SR account.<br /><br />If only verified options are available to you for purchasing bitcoin, then you are going to need to add an extra step to anonymize your coins.<br /><br />You will also need to familiarize yourself with PGP (peer to peer text encryption) and definitely need to check out the buyer&#039;s guide, wiki, etc. <br /><br />All the resources and info you need to successfully pull this off is already out there, and we&#039;ve all jumped through the same hoops pertaining to our specific situations.<br /><br />It may seem a bit daunting at first, but it&#039;s not that hard to figure it all out, and with a bit of effort, you can school yourself up in no time.

				Hi!!!<br /><br />The way I was told how to do it was go to localbitcoins.com - find a seller in your area - country - depending on how you wanted to do it (in person or via bank transfer, in branch bank deposit)&nbsp; and then open up a block chain account ( or another wallet). <br /><br />Wait for the seller on localbitcoin to deposit your bitcoins on your account and than transfer them to your secondary wallet (blockchain or other provider of wallet).<br /><br />and then transfer from there to anywhere you like - note that you only need to use a secondary wallet provider if you send your btc to SR since localbitcoin won&#039;t directly send btc to sr (for reasons unknown to me)<br /><br />Hope this helped - just trying to pass the info on<br /><br />CHEERS<br /><br />CP

				also like capipapi posted, localbitcoins is a great alternative too if you can meet someone in your area willing to sell at a reasonable price. theres lots of people who mine and are will to sell at average price if your near a big city. just meet them, pay cash and they will send to your wallet address. once 1 confirmation is made the trade is irreversible i think so you dont have to sit there for every confirmation. this is very anonymous as well <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166905.msg1189325#msg1189325">Quote from: capipapi on June 02, 2013, 01:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">note that you only need to use a secondary wallet provider if you send your btc to SR since localbitcoin won&#039;t directly send btc to sr (for reasons unknown to me)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />obviously you dont want to send bitcoins that are attached to your personal information to SR. if the person selling the bitcoins is not into illigal purchases, they probably have their coins stored in an account or wallet with their personal information. if SR becomes compromised they might not want to take the chance of authorities seeing them sending money to a website that sells illegal products. same reason why you should use a wallet when sending coins to SR.

Click the drop down menu, and go straight to Bitcoin Address. Go to account screen on SR, click/copy your SR BTC Wallet address.&nbsp; Paste it in the box on the BitInstant page, and proceed!<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t get any easier!

				Thanks to Scintillation&#039;s points about safety, I&#039;ve taken down the old listing and created a new listing. Free info on obtaining bitcoins is now at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download.

Works great for me but I&#039;m within 2 minutes of wallyworld and CVS. I just posted this in a similar thread<br /><br /><br />Create a blockchain wallet, then while your on your blockchain wallet page, hit the deposit cash link. It will walk you thru the process, which, utilizes bitinstant for the deposit. Again, it will walk you thru it. .Moneygram doesn&#039;t do bitcoiuns per say, it is just used to send money, from their point of view, your just paying&nbsp; bill.<br />Here&#039;s how it works<br /><br />1- create a wallet on blockchain, it&#039;s anonymous<br />2- hit the cash deposit link (this must be done with your wallet page open)<br />3- it will walk you thru the process and give you all the info you need to take to a moneygram outlet<br />4- at moneygram, you will send your $$$ to an intermediate company,given to you by blockchain, I wont mention the name here but to moneygram it looks like your paying a bill...(bitinstant will give you a receiver code for the intermediate co, this code ID&#039;s that company for moneygram so they know who to send it to)<br />4- this intermediate company will do the rest and your dollars will magically appear in your blockchain wallet as bitcoins<br />5- transfer to your SR wallet (it can take a few hours for this transfer to go thru, don&#039;t worry , it works)<br /><br />The reason for the middle wallet is security, and, I&#039;m not sure you can deposit right into the SR wallet, unless you trust one of the SR bitcoin vendors to do it but that is done outside the escrow system and it&#039;s easy for them to burn you, and, they can sometimes take&nbsp; lot longer than most people would like.<br /><br />I hope that all made sense.
