				It&#039;s probably the slight change in the value of BTC between you funding your account and buying things. When I paid for my vendor account I ended up with 0.009999 leftover despite having originally only had the exact right amount of BTC.

				No. That&#039;s not it. I only deposited 1.2 BC&nbsp; and spent over 1.1. <br /><br />No other deposits other than my own show in my account history.<br /><br />

				I had a transaction cancelled and ended up with 0.2 BTC less than what I&#039;d paid (hedged transaction). Initially, I thought this was down to fluctuations in the BTC exchange rate but no I checked the exchange rate chart over the period the transaction had been placed and then cancelled - and it was flat. I later heard that SR charges 4% for hedged transactions which is not refundable even if the transaction is cancelled, so I guess that&#039;s where I made my loss. Thing is that the vendor cancelled because I&#039;d selected the wrong postage option, however they didn&#039;t have any instructions on their listing about what kind of postage I should use. Shit, if they had have just messaged me telling me that I didn&#039;t choose the right postage option and they needed a little more money to cover their postage expenses (it wasn&#039;t a lot), I would have just sent it to them and then they wouldn&#039;t have had to cancel the transaction. Not a big issue, but no one likes to lose $20.
