				Hello, <br />I&#039;m a new newbie and realize I&#039;m probably worrying over nothing BUT<br />I ordered a 1/4 oz. of weed. It was marked in transit the next day. 7 shipping days pass. I contact the seller who quickly responses in 1 hour later saying &quot;I can find the tracking number if you send me your city and state&quot;. so i send him the city and state. 19 hour pass and seller replies that it was delivered 3 days after I placed the order. I response by asking how is this possible and what should I do if anything. the seller has since not responded. SHOULD I BE CONCERNED that the package was somehow caught? IS A CONTROLLED DELIVERY LIKELY? Though I have done my research and know what to do in the event of a controlled delivery I&#039;m still uneasy.<br /><br />This is my first SR buy ever and I feel like I&#039;m the dark as to what is going on. Getting caught would really fuck up my life. <br /><br />additionally this seller has good reviews for fast shipping in fact most say 3 days coast to coast, over 60 transaction and a 5 out of 5.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

				Domestic.<br />That&#039;s not great news but not bad ether.<br />That package (or hopefully envelop) has my name and address on it. so better to be caught by someone who would simply just steal it. But that raises the question HOW? how did it get caught?

				Besides the fact I just wasted a decent amount of money on a seller who is now ignoring me. I am more concerned with where that weed filled envelop (which has my name and address on it) is currently located. The greedy mailman&#039;s house? Or the mail inspectors desk?<br /><br />Also isn&#039;t it the sellers job to ensure the package doesn&#039;t smell and is ready to be sent though the US postal system? After all who stays in business if their clients don&#039;t get what they pay for?

				if your expecting a signature required package i wouldnt have done that !!!! should of just got regular post because if you get the package and you know its coming through non signed post and it wants a signature then I dont sign for it because i say i didnt order anything and am not signing for it ... but in your situation i dont Know it might come but it might have been caught and there trying to set up a bust on whereever you posted it to . just IMO dont get tracked post because that NEEDS a signature which is dodgy because you have just signed for a package you were expecting and then get raided .. its a hard 1 .

				No way I would sign for a package. under any circumstances. the shipping method used does not require signature. that would be a terrible idea. but I am growing concerned that the item is being held while things are being legally processed. this brings me to another question. if they were trying catch me why would the package be marked as delivered? wouldn&#039;t they know that would raise suspicion?

				I&#039;m inclined to agree with the last 2 posts. Ha ha really waiting is the only thing I can do at this point anyway. Wait for weed or wait for pigs. but ether way wait. <br /><br />Also I&#039;ve decided if the weed does show (and doesn&#039;t require a signature of course) I&#039;m still just gonna let it sit unopened for a day or two. just to support plausible deniability <br /><br />But still just to be safe I made sure my house is clean. And I manage all this online stuff off a 16GB micro SD. The SD actually has the OS (which I&#039;m using right now) and every thing that is even remotely associated with the SR on it. Its easy to hide and if it become necessary easy to destroy. But I&#039;m getting off topic.<br /><br />So the general consensus is I&#039;m probably not at risk? Or rather the weed was likely not found? I&#039;ve been reading online, USPS priority doesn&#039;t exactly have a great rack record....

				hmmm interesting point. at best I could let it sit with a pile of unopened mail for a day. too bad the mail box is in a block with other boxes and needs a key to be opened. otherwise I could place the weed off site for a few days and could argue &quot;well someone must have used my mail box and picked up the mail when i wasn&#039;t looking...&quot;<br /><br />any ideas?

				1st of all, regarding the signature issue, I&#039;ve HAD A VENDOR WHO WAS NEW NOT REALIZE THAT HE HAD TO WAIVE THE SIG OPTION, AND , I&#039;ve had just gung ho postal workers ask for a sig just because they want to cover their own ass.

				www: <br />you sound like an asshole but what you wrote makes a lot of sense. the cost of a cop (or cops) stopping by is less than the purchase price. many times over. however i would never claim to understand the inner workings of&nbsp; law enforcement.... also I have two extremely awesome dogs so lets hope it doesn&#039;t come to that. <br /><br />88fxstc:<br />I&#039;m not sure what constitutes a new vendor but this seller had 60+ transactions. <br />nothing is being held for me at the housing management office. I called today and three days ago asking (not directly of course). nothing was being held or has been received for anyone in my house hold in the last two weeks. I was careful to check. as far as contacting the post office directly that is something I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m willing to do. <br />I have told no one of my SR business. And I mean exactly that. NO ONE. I&#039;m a big believer in compartmentalization. 2 months ago a friend told me about bit coin and the SR. After much private research I&#039;ve made a first purchase -- the purchase we now are discussing now. I can say with high degree certainty no one but me was expecting that piece of mail. I taking good measure to ensure that. Namely:<br />1) I&#039;ve not spoken a word of SR or bit coin (since I first heard of it)<br />2) Never used anything but a tor bridge<br />3) Never used anything but a public internet (with proper precautions of course)<br />I&#039;ll spare you the rest of the details but needless to say only me and the seller knew. I understand most of this is unnecessary but anonymity is important to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as receiving mail, I know the mail man by name and I have had high value items come by mail with no problem before now.<br /><br />It is possible my mail was stolen. but I don&#039;t think it would have been stolen unless the theft knew what was in the piece of mail. otherwise why risk stealing some random piece of mail only to find a paper weight or a stapler?

				Hey Dude, I was just throwing out some thoughts off the top o my head.&nbsp; One thing that would answer some Q&#039;s would be to get the tracking info and check yourself. If the vendor isn&#039;t giving it up, or he&#039;s completely ignoring you, sounds like he&#039;s hiding something. But, what do I know dude, just what I read in a few sentences so I took some guesses. I do hope it works out in the end for ya.<br />Good Luck

				I&#039;ve requested the tracking info. but no reply. Of course it is a friday night so we&#039;ll see, hopefully everything pans out this weekend. On that note I do have some where to be soon and would to thank everyone for their input. I have learned a lot in the last few hours thanks to this form and look forward to becoming a member of this community.

				If the vendor doesn&#039;t reply or refuses to give you the tracking, then when you are able, click resolve and request the vendor provide them with the tracking. Don&#039;t know what happened, but definitely wouldn&#039;t just take the vendor&#039;s word on it.

				Still no reply from the vendor. It is looking more likely that I may need use the resolve option. <br /><br />I did list my real name and address. I took that risk just to avoid it getting lost or mis-delivery. Also because I do know the mailman (just by name we&#039;re not friends or anything) and he would know if the name on the envelop didn&#039;t belong to anyone in my house hold. <br /><br />I am absolutely certain the address was correct. I&#039;m trying to buy drugs on the internet I don&#039;t take this shit lightly.

				OK now I really do need advice on what to do. <br /><br />I choose to use the resolve feature and within minutes the seller responds with a tracking number. But the tracking number says the weed was delivered to some other city. Not where I live and certainly not the address I gave the seller. its the wrong fucking city! can I somehow prove it&#039;s not the address I gave the seller? I know beyond a shadow of a doubt I submitted the correct address (including city and zip code). I checked USPS and google and reread the address a few times. I gave the right fucking address. But the tracking number doesn&#039;t show my city. <br /><br />Also the seller is offering only 50% refund saying &quot;This will not go well with the resolution center on your end. I can provide a 50% refund at the most&quot;. Is the seller trying to fuck me over because I&#039;m new? is the seller scamming me or was there just a mistake made? And if so how can I prove it? Is there a way to prove the address I gave to the seller? <br /><br />Not to mention if it was shipped to some random ass city does it have my name on it? is there weed out there waiting in someones mailbox (say a cop or some goodie two shoes) with my full real name plastered on in it big fucking letters?<br /><br />Please advice. This guy (or girl) is really starting to piss me off.
