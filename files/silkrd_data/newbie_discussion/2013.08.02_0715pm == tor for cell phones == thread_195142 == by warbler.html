				I stick with wifi and hardly use the actual data but I do see wha you are saying and was curious about all that myself. Hopefully someone who knows a hell of a lot more about this can share some knowledge.

				In the states If i was really worried I&#039;d do the following.<br />Get a prepaid with a data plan (you can switch identities when it runs out)<br />use Tor and wifi from public hotspots.. not at your home or place of work.<br />switch carriers from time to time with pre paid phones/plans..<br />You&#039;d have to be very worried or have a lot to loose by going to all that trouble.. but it&#039;s a way to insulate your risk.

				Orbot is very secure.&nbsp; Orweb browser works for that.&nbsp; Orbot = mobile Tor.&nbsp; It is still Tor.&nbsp; It is still anonymous.<br /><br /><br />Getting busted and having your phone taken and having them be able to get into your phone and look through your stuff, would be the fault of you for not rooting your phone, and taking necessary steps to ensure that your phone is clean and clear.&nbsp; Any good dealer/distributer has 3 phones.&nbsp; The real-life phone, the orbot phone, and the burner for local distribution.<br /><br />All of this information is readily available here in the forums; if you have less than 50 posts you won&#039;t be able to reply to those threads, but that doesn&#039;t mean that they do not exist.&nbsp; <br /><br />Patience is a virtue.

				One other thing to note; the Orweb browser keeps those cookies that SR loads to keep you logged in active for much much longer than your normal Tor browser for PC or Mac.&nbsp; So, always remember to log out of your SR account when you&#039;re finished up with your business transactions when using Orbot/Orweb.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />It&#039;s not a crime to have Tor.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t save browsing history.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let paranoia make your decisions.
