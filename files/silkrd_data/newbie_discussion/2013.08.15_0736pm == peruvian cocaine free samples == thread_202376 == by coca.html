				Hey guys,<br />Im off on my second trip to peru on saturday.I was there last year and my god is the coke some serious shit&nbsp; :o..<br />I have a mate over there (we are both from the UK)who can get pure stuff. The price is very cheap over there for coke so I was thinking of doing a little business with some people if they are up for it..<br /><br />Im planning on taking orders for some to post back to whoever wants it..the cost will be 60$/g and its pure so where can you go wrong.<br />I wont put any more than 5g in one envolope for safety and hopefully better chance of getting through.<br />Tormail is gone so if anyone interested please leave a pm and we can chat or give alternative way of contact.<br />Ill be there for 3 weeks and will take orders the whole time im there. So hopefully for the skeptics ill have some feedback on this before they order..<br />Look forward to helpin you out :)

				About 75% of coke sent from Peru in letters, small packages gets intercepted. Look at some vendors who work out of Peru and see on their feedback how many shipments never reached the buyer. Peru is a flagged country. <br />And a repeat of wht the previous poster said, You CANNOT vend to SR members outside of the established SR system. If you&#039;re set on this establish a vendor account.

				As a noob myself i would suggest that the best thing for you to do is to get some confidence in clients, send some free packages. As Peru is flagged it would seem the chance of recieving goods is low so if its free then that shouldnt affect anyone to much, going by how much it costs in south america you would be a fool to be paying more than $2 a g so bite the bullet, invest $30 give 15 samples and then go from there....

				I&#039;ve been to peru last year and 2$ a g is bull. Also my mate lives there and he said hes paid 10$ at least for a g ..what im willing to do is send out 0.5g samples. Ill send 20 of these but I want 10$ to cover shipping cost. I cant be any fairer than that

				Place an add om SR for samples and put the price at the postage cost only. 10 is very steep price to pay, you are getting ripped off. I had it posted to europe from there at $6 from a friend and he was making 4 profit. search around, i kid you not. im only trying to be of help!

				You aren&#039;t the first person to try and make this work.&nbsp; Another vendor on SR in particular has tried really hard.&nbsp; His packaging is top notch but many of his packages don&#039;t make it.&nbsp; I think success rate to the US is even worse.&nbsp; I commend you on trying but just want to warn you that recovering the $500 bond might prove to be difficult.<br /><br />You also need to seal the cocaine in moisture barrier bags that have had all cocaine contaminants removed from the outside of the bag.

You are going to have to be very creative in order to get enough packages through to turn a profit. It&#039;s difficult to make clear how hard it is to ship out of a country like Peru. There isn&#039;t much that is contraband that anyone wants to ship out of Peru except for coke. So they are REALLY looking out for it. They also have assists from DEA, Postal Service, etc. If you could get 75% of the packages out you would probably be among the most successful SR vendors ever.

If it was even halfway easy to ship from Peru SR would be flooded with hi quality Peruvian C. Think about how much (or how little actually) mail probably comes out of Peru. In that country every package is considered to have contraband unless otherwise proven. With the focus put on by the locals, with assists from USPS, DEA, etc it isn&#039;t surprising how hard it is to get anything out. There is a guy on SR working out of Peru and look at his feedback. He has to refund like 4 out of every 5 orders because they didn&#039;t get through. Want to get really good Peruvian for really cheap? Go to Peru.

				&quot;Peru combats use of postal service for narco-trafficking; More than 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of cocaine hydrochloride have been seized this year at the main sorting facility of Peru’s postal service.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;http://infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/en_GB/features/saii/features/main/2012/07/09/feature-02<br /><br />With only 5000 pieces of mail leaving the country every day it&#039;s no wonder the success rate of posting cocaine is so low. Even if packaged with the best stealth, dozens of letters posted to the same city week after week will quickly draw the attention of postal inspectors. Lately I&#039;ve been looking into mail-forwarding services but it seems like more trouble than its worth. Still if I had someone I could trust in down there in Lima and communication was flawless, I&#039;d be up for a try.

				if LE wanted to get addresses of sr users so they could watch their mail, the best way would be to offer free samples of some shit on here that sounds really good, and just wait for everyone to send them their addresses. i don&#039;t think i&#039;m gonna be going for any more free samples of vendors anymore. its nice to have a little turn on just for writing a review every now and then but its just not worth putting my regular orders at risk. i need my address to stay clear of any suspicion.

				Nothing illegal in a free sample its the ones you pay for you should worry about. A phising scam from LE offering free samples would not stand up in court that&#039;s for sure!<br /><br />Sadly we all know the chances of cocaine leaving peru by post is slim, almost impossible. The only way that coke would make it to us as already stated, it needs to leave peru first. This of course does happen all the time lol As we know once it does it cut.. thats coke for you

				Don&#039;t think you have the ability to do this, sorry to say. You can&#039;t even research how to properly do business on this site, how are we to trust you to get coke out of peru. Sounds good, but you sound a fool. Do some thorough research and then maybe? But most people don&#039;t have the ability to do simple research. In mean look aat all the dumb questions people ask that a simple google search could find. Or a look at erowid. What yoi don&#039;t know erowid but you have found the silk road???????&nbsp; Bottles the mind.
