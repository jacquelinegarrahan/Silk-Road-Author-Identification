				As the title implies I&#039;m looking for a way as a vendor to send in some product/hash/cannabis to be lab tested for its purity/content. The closest I&#039;ve found so far by searching is the thread Offering free limited gas chrom. Testing for thc levels to vendors: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165848.msg1190535 - however it seems like it&#039;s based in the US and not much has happened since. There&#039;s also threads like Drug Purity/Authentication Testing with NIK kits: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159626.msg1125973 - but this doesn&#039;t appear to show any specifics on the drug as far as I can see. If one lives in the Netherlands there&#039;s the option of http://www.drugs-test.nl/ - this has the drawback that it has to be done in person and it appears some drugs are restricted from testing.<br /><br />So what options are available for the rest of us?&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;m not ready to give up on this idea quite yet. While I suppose there is no direct way of testing anything outside of those countries specified surely there must be some way of indirectly sending it to a dispensary which would then be able to test it? They could potentially take a premium for performing that service but if that is the only way to do it then so be it.<br /><br />I have some ideas how I might be able to find the information in a very unconventional manner, but I would only try that idea as a last resort as the idea itself would require quite a bit of planning - I will return with results on that one in a couple of days/weeks if I see I get no answers here.
