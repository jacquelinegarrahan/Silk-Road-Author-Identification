				Hey,<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly new to SR and just received my third order with a well-reviewed oxy vendor. I had her ship it Express and was made to sign for it by a male postal worker, as opposed to the female delivery lady who normally delivers my mail. My question is this: Should I be worried that it was a controlled delivery, and if so--what should I do about it at this point? Since it was just a small amount of pills, you&#039;d think the chances of getting caught are slim unless the vendor were compromised, and so maybe she just forgot to check the &quot;Waive signature&quot; box. Either way, I&#039;m feeling pretty stupid about signing now and am wondering if there&#039;s anything I can do to maximize my safety at this stage.<br /><br />Thanks everyone.

				Do not open the package. Write &quot;return to sender&quot; on the package. Wait for a couple of days.<br /><br />If the feds come knocking, tell them it&#039;s not the package you expected (you&#039;re an avid Amazon shopper, yes?) and wanted to return it, just had not gotten to bringing it to the post office yet.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve already opened it, same story, tape it back shut and write &quot;return to sender&quot; on it. Tell the feds its contents did not match with what you expected.<br /><br />If the feds try to incriminate you and say &quot;but these are drugs, didn&#039;t you see! why didn&#039;t you report!&quot; you tell them you figured it was a dietary supplement, diet pill, caffeine pill or whatever. Even the thought of illegal substances never occured to you.<br /><br />If they still don&#039;t buy that, stick to the fifth amendment (or if you&#039;re not a US citizen, the right to remain silent).

				Don&#039;t worry too much about it.&nbsp; At least twice I&#039;ve had a postal worker ask for a signature when the vendor waived the sig requirement. Sometimes the postal worker justr asks for a sig as a mistake, I&#039;ve even had one say to me , &quot; there&#039;s no sig required for this but I&#039;m just covering my ass&quot; . That was many months ago and upwards of 25ish orders ago so it was obviously nothing to do with LEO or a sting, just an overzealous postman.
