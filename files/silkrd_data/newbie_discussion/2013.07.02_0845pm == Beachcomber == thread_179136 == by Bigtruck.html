				Has anyone had any interaction with beachcomber recently?&nbsp; He communicated great in the beginning and said he was throwing in extra because he was three days late to ship. But I haven&#039;t heard back since he said I owe ya one I shipped without throwing in your extra. No. Biggie as long as I get my original pack I&#039;ll be happy. U paid for a tracked package and asked what&#039;s up with it and no response. I&#039;m not hitting the panic button I&#039;m just curious as to anyone else&#039;s experience and any input is appreciated greatly! Thank you all for your time and wisdom and hope I&#039;m not over reacting<br />BigTruck

				One of my first purchases was going to be from him. I ordered an oz of w/e at the time, order was processing for a good 4 days, I changed my mind, asked him to cancel the order, and said he couldn&#039;t because he already sent the package, he still didn&#039;t mark it in transit, messaged him a few times to get no response. I waited. No package, so I cancelled the order about a week and a half after the initial thing.<br /><br />The dude seemed totally out of it when I spoke to him.

				I have a feeling I&#039;m gonna take a hit on my 300 some odd bucks and it sucked because I was so enthusiastic and optimistic about starting to use sr and build a Web of honorable go to vendors. I almost didn&#039;t order because he had a less that 99 average but I said huh 94 can&#039;t be bad. Grrrrr maybe I&#039;m jumping the gun but he won&#039;t respond to any messages in 3 days and not tracking when I paid for it

				In bc defense I just checked his vendor. Page and it says he hasn&#039;t been on in three days and all orders will ship Tuesday which I believe means today. There&#039;s no date.&nbsp; But he still hasn&#039;t been on in 3 days which would answer why he hasn&#039;t answered my messages. I&#039;ll most define keep you all updated and will probably be asking for advice family

				Just got a message back said he was away and the holiday might be holding my package up. Gave me tracking info and on site it says electronic info received but I&#039;m not quite sure if the actual item was received for shipment. Says it should take 2-9 days on the site so I&#039;ll keep ya updated thanks&nbsp; Bigtruck
