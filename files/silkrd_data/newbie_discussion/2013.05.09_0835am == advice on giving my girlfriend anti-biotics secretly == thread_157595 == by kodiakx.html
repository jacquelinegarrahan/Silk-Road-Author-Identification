				Anyone have advice on how to give my girlfriend antibiotics secretly?<br />I got an STD curable by antibiotics from another girl, she has confirmed this and now I have it.<br />I am now worried about my girlfriend. I need to give my girlfriend a treatment and myself at the same time.<br />I am going for the shotgun approach, the single dose pills to get rid of clamydia, trich, and gonorrhea just in case.<br />The girl I got it from may have given me something else, who knows.<br />Anyways, there are several pills she needs to take, so not sure of the best way to secretly get her to take.<br />I was thinking of making a smoothie and blending it into her drink, but not sure if it would make it taste bitter.<br />Of course, I will treat myself again at this same time.<br />I would like to do the right thing and tell her to go get tested and treated by a doctor, but she has recently been diagnosed as bi-polar and is on so many medications, some anti-psychotic.&nbsp; She also recently lost her job, and is quite stressed at this time.<br />One time recently she even told me she would kill me and herself if I ever cheated on her. She has changed since I met her, and at this time I cannot just break up with her, or tell her about getting the STD from another women, it would endanger her life and possibly mine.<br />I think the best thing to do at this time is get her treated with anti-biotic in case she has something. And not cause some mental imbalance in her life right now. I don&#039;t see a long term future between us, but she needs my support right now.<br />So please no judgement, just some ideas on how to get her to ingest these medications.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />

				I am also a person with bipolar disorder.<br /><br />I am not saying this in judgment, but rather taking you at your word that you are concerned for her well-being:<br /><br />1) There is always an interaction potential between antipsychotics and other medications, which is why us psychos need to regularly see psychiatrists and have our medications memorized for any unforeseen hospital visits. Do you know what antibiotics you&#039;re using? Do you know what antipsychotics she is using? Are you medical literature-literate enough to be able to confirm that there aren&#039;t adverse interactions between these medications? <br /><br />2) By your message, it sounds like you want to give her just one big dose (perhaps I&#039;m misreading). That isn&#039;t how antibiotics work. All that would produce is a drug-resistant version of whatever STD she may have contracted from you, which would leave her worse off. If you were going to do this, you would need to be able to give her the FULL course of the antibiotic, regularly, no skipping days, no ending the treatment early. So, whatever it is that you were doing, it would have to be routinized as a daily thing that would not arouse her suspicion.<br /><br />3) Crushing or grinding the medications may compromise their effectiveness.<br /><br />I sympathize with your situation, but I don&#039;t think there is a way to square the circle between your desire for her to receive STD treatment and your desire for her to be unaware of it. And doing an antibiotic treatment half-way or, God forbid, for only one day, would be worse than not giving her antibiotics at all.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;m not a physician.<br /><br />But, as a bipolar person who has suffered from suicidality, I would rather have someone just tell me what happened and give me the chance to get proper treatment.

				I would put the pill(s) on my tongue and slip it(them) into her pussy while licking her. I could do this for you, where do you live?
