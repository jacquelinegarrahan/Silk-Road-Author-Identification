				Well in the long term, the value is almost guaranteed to keep rising as long as the currency stays around. I&#039;m talking years down the road here. If we&#039;re talking next few weeks to few months, then I&#039;m going to hazard that it&#039;s going to snap back to a much lower price point. It&#039;s rising too fast for it to be stable.

				If your running a commercial operation, definitely drugs. Guaranteed return, instead of just a possible return (or possible loss), and you should have higher profit margins as long as you keep turnover up.

				In my opinion, the more that people hoard large amounts of bitcoins, the higher the value becomes for the remaining ones. <br />It&#039;s far better (for everyone)&nbsp; to just buy what you need, when you need it.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I accept that this will never happen.<br /><br />Who can resist buying a few more to keep when the rates are low? Vicious circle.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Agree with above though, I think rate will fall soon. It&#039;s risen too quick to remain stable. <br />

				I saw a news article somewhere that a student developed a special gpu to mine bitcoins more efficently than was possible before. I would guess that prices might increase if ppl start mining with thoes vid cards like crazy. Just my guess.

				Bitcoin rewards have halved from 50 to 25 per successful block, and the difficulty is increasing.<br />It&#039;s easier to buy them than mine them right now.<br />It only makes sense for the price to go up, folks weren&#039;t even breaking even on their mining efforts in the last year.<br />That being said, who knows when it will all crash, someone could hack mtgox again, or drop a shitload of cheap coins into the exchange and drive the price down.

				BTC are for buying ish and gambling online the idiots buying them as an investment will lose out big time as this will not last put it this way the idiot keeping them at this price could lose the whole lot tomorrow as<br />there&#039;s only around 2 mill btc available at any one time anyway i&#039;ve stopped buying them rite now as this is just BS a month ago they were half what they are now I just cannot wait for the idiot who&#039;s bought all those coins for his or hers computer to crash or overheat or a simple mistake to wipe the lot from that stupid wallet I hope it happens soon ie within the next month

				They&#039;ll drop again, for sure, but no doubt after that they&#039;ll continue to rise.<br /><br />Eventually it will be quite big and the government will actually try and do something about it, shutting down big sites like mt gox, making it crash bigtime.

				If they continue to become more popular, the price will inevitably rise. The rate is the unknown here, and that all depends on how quickly it becomes popular.

There&#039;s something like 23 million in circulation (?) ...the more that people hang on to their coins, the higher the value of the remaining coins. Simple maths.<br /><br /><br /><br />
