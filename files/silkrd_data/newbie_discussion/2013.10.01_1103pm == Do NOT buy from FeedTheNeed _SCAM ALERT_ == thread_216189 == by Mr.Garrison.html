				Recently I was just spending the last bitcoins in my account so i decided to buy a few items from feedtheneed, i bought 3 OZ of red kratom and 2 OZ of salvia, the kratom never showed up, most likely he never sent it, shipping was domestic. i received a box of salvia that was not even bagged, it was floating around in the box, when i took it out it weighed 13.8 and did not produce any salvia like effects, messaged vendor and he did not respond so me, having 1000$+ in successful transactions sadly had to resolve my first order, for some reason SR decided i should only receive half of my BTC back even though this vendors last 50 reviews are all saying that he is a scammer and not to be trusted, his profile says he is &quot;sending out free items to raise his unfairly tarnished rating&quot;, im not angry about losing any BTC, im just letting some people know to NOT buy from this vendor, you will not recieve product, and if you do, the weight will be off and the packaging is very poor. maybe its my fault for buying from him
