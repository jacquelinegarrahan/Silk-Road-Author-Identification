				I was recently scammed by a seller who has vanished, EJDirect. My funds are in escrow, but he marked the package in transit and requested I FE&#039;d but said it wasn&#039;t necessary. I of course respectfully declined. 2 days later he is gone. I messaged him multiple times between his request and his disappearance.&nbsp; I would just like my funds returned so that I can make a purchase as soon as possible. Any tips on things I can do to speed up this process, or in general would be greatly appreciated.

				I don&#039;t see why it would be a problem to get my funds back if they are still in escrow. I just would like to know the time these things take, and if i can speed it along at all. But what ended up happening to your funds/when did this take place?

				The whole point of escrow is to protect you from exactly what happened. I would contact scout or a more experienced member via pm and ask him/her what the time expected for you btc to come back. my guess would be that the gm or moderators in the case would have to give your funds back. but im not quite sure.

If the vendor has had lots of shady dealings the support staff will probably return your coins pretty fast! Hope this is helpful and good luck!

				I hate saying it but&nbsp; going with reputable and experienced vendors with lots of happy transactions pays off. <br /><br />Fly by night operations are pretty easy to spot.&nbsp; THey got the best prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)
