				I&#039;ve never tripped on acid/LSD before. I&#039;m strictly a weed smoker looking to have an actual trip. Any suggestions on quality vendors for good prices? I saw something like 100 blotters for .56 bitcoins (the market is down for me right now). What are good deals on acid? I&#039;m not looking for anything too strong. Just some easy acid I won&#039;t freak on.

One blotter tab is about between 50 and 100 ug.

				if you saw 100 tabs going for 0.56 btc then it was probably one of the nBOMEs (25i, 25c, etc) which aren&#039;t LSD but are a lot cheaper.&nbsp; what are you trying to get out of the lsd trip? are you trying to have fun at a party or are you trying to learn more about yourself?

				Never tried acid before but if you are looking for a trip that is pretty easy to ride try USAShroomz powdered philosopher stones. They are great for a first time tripper because it has a shorter trip duration than acid and the dose is easier to control.

				I think most of the LSD in the market look pretty good.&nbsp; I recall it being a lot cheaper when I was a kid, but here they appear to cost 10 bucks a hit or so.&nbsp; Start with one to get a feel for it.&nbsp; If taken in the right setting, you&#039;ll be able to have an introspective thought provoking trip.&nbsp; I guess the best advice I have is to avoid taking it around people you don&#039;t know or trust, or anyone that gives off even a slight weird feeling.

				Sounds to me like its not LSD.&nbsp; Probably some type of nbome.&nbsp; The nbome series is holds its own, but is still a PEA.&nbsp; LSD is a TYR, and it is a world of difference. <br /><br />Spend the extra money on a few hits of LSD.&nbsp; I prefer to dose 200-300ug.&nbsp; Maybe with 200mg MDMA after a few hours.<br /><br />It costs a bit more, but Its well worth it

If possible, I recommend tripping with someone (preferably someone with a bit of experience), but stay away from people that you don&#039;t completely trust or like. Acid makes my friends and me more emotional and less rational, so being in an uncomfortable environment can really mess with you more than it would if sober. But again, it&#039;s largely mindset that determines whether a trip is good or bad.

				This may differ form conventional opinion, but if you are looking for a deep self journey, i would recommend eating at least 5. LSD can be ingested in large quantities with no physical consequences. The more you eat, the better. Especially if its good fluff or something, the harder you trip, the more clear and natural it becomes. Especially if its your first time, you want to get as much out as possible. If you are going to freak out (which I doubt, its not as common as you might think) you will freak out whether you take 1 or 10. Youll be okay, and your perception of all things you are concious of, including yourself, will be forever changed. Have&nbsp; fun!

				just do what i did and start off with some 25c-NBOMe if your not experienced with anything acid or lsd like. its really cheap and if you have no tolerance just pop 2 in your gums above your 2 front teeth for about 30minutes then swallow (or spit).

				I would recommend starting out slow and testing 50 to 120 ug, maybe just hanging out with good friend watching movie/listening music or hike or combination of both.&nbsp; If your new to psychedelics, start slow and low and then if you like it build up from there.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Merry Prankster said it really well, you really should start out low if it is your first time on any psychedelic drug as you don&#039;t know how your mind and body reacts to the experience. The first time I tried LSD we were 3 friends splitting 2 x 100ug and that was really sufficient for a first time as none of was knowing what to expect.<br /><br />Try to be at a location a bit outside town or away from the crowds of people that you wanna avoid risking coming in contact with. Like at a cottage or a farm or such. Maybe go out in nature and take bath and just looking and existing amongst all the beautiful things there is out there...<br /><br />Good luck

				I recommend reading Hoffman, Timothy Leary and especially Stanislav Grof books if you&#039;d like to get into theory. <br /><br />Start with a 100ug for a first time. Do it in a calm, natural enviroment without people (or with a close friend). Do not do it at home. Then your risk of getting bad trip would be very-very low.<br /><br />I&#039;ve started with 150-250ug at rave and that was FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE, but there were diffucult moments.

				I would highly recommend going to the The Avengers Vendor Review thread and look at the original post on page 1.&nbsp; There you will find a list of vendors.&nbsp; After reading that page and seeing as it is your first time.&nbsp; I would highly recommend a minimum of 100ug in your system.&nbsp; Currently jesusofrave is offering single tab hoffman blotter listings which have been tested to be approx 100ug :)&nbsp; You are new at this.&nbsp; You know you better than anyone.&nbsp; Some like to cannonball into the water and some like to dip their toe in first.&nbsp; He offers really fast worldwide shipping and he is praised for his excellence in all aspects of SR transactions and customer service.&nbsp; Order a tab it will come out to .21 BTC = $27 USD.&nbsp; Yes this is expensive but will be worth it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pink Floyd - Echoes&nbsp; 8)
