				Okay seriously, im relatively new and out of 6 recent orders with highly rated vendors Ive received only 1 order in the last month... The rest either dont respond and dont ever ship, or dont respond and cancel, or dont respond and have phycotic breakdowns (no names mentioned Eh... Hem.. Hiro... Cough...)&nbsp; or dont respond and just dont respond....<br /><br />Does ANYONE actually ship on SK or what??

				Gotta do your research better. Especially on the forums. I&#039;ve been here for at least a month before I started ordering and in the beginning I thought I had found good quality vendors, but when continuing to read on the forums I quickly came to another opinion. Reviews on SR are not as reliable as reviews on the forums by more than a few trusted posters. So guys with 51 post claiming here that god himself has made the product probably aren&#039;t real.

				I think the biggest problem is that some vendors can maintain brilliant feedback despite a huge percentage of parcels not showing up.<br /><br />If buyers would stop giving 5/5 for parcels that don&#039;t show up, I&#039;ve no doubt that a lot more parcels would arrive.&nbsp; A newbie should be able to get a good indication of how much they can trust a vendor from their feedback score and at the moment that simply isn&#039;t the case.

				All the vendors I have used have been great, perhaps a little more research next time? or your address has been flagged. I dont think its fair to slag off the vendors on SR, 99% of them are great with great products and excellent customer service.

				I got nothing but good impressions. 13 orders all arrived, on schedule, on weight, on quality. <br />Maybe Im just lucky.<br /><br />My recipe: I only order from domestic vendors last seen today, no less than 95 and good reviews. If I smell the smallest hint of scam, I dont buy. Theres plenty of vendors out there.

				Listen to feedback, look at the products they sell and how much of it they sell and even message them a friendly PM if your unsure about a vendors T&amp;Cs. I&#039;ve used the road for just over a year now and have NEVER had any problems with any vendor. Packages always come when they are meant too.<br /><br />Only one time was a package from Spain got lost, but the vendor shipped out my full order again for free and I received it a few days later. <br /><br />It just seems like bad luck on your part. Some vendors ask new-comers to FE just to make sure they wont get scammed. Just be careful.

				I would say your probably just unlucky! Between 2 accounts i have made 8 orders and one of them was through the forums when the road was under attack (I sent BTC straight away) and all 8 have been fine, not one problem!<br /><br />I try my best to stick to domestic vendors (have only ordered non domestic once) and make sure i study the review thread for the vendors before i pick who i will use. I like to stick in the top 10% of sellers where possible as well!

				out of the 20 items I&#039;ve had shipped not one has failed to arrive so all you can do is read the review threads on the forum and try to find a reliable vendor and stick with it<br /><br />kind of like real life drug buying except replace &quot;review threads&quot; with word and &quot;the forum&quot; with street.<br /><br />obviously don&#039;t order moderate- to-&nbsp; large amounts of anything until you find a reliable source

				Like others have said, you gotta do your research. I&#039;ve been here maybe 5 months and after over 20 orders I&#039;ve only had 1 that I wasn&#039;t totally happy with . It showed up, just took longer than it should have and I couldn&#039;t get the vendor to give up the tracking info. All others have been great , shipping time, customer service and quality, all were right on.

				I agree with only buying from established vendors. I haven&#039;t found something that I wanted without an established vendor (most of the time domestic) selling it. The exception so far is ketamine, I have heard some not so good things about UGS recently and that was the only name on there that I recognized. <br /><br />Good luck with your packages mate.

				It can depend a lot on where its shipped from and where its shipped to, example south america to US, or Holland to UK? <br /><br />See what I mean?<br /><br />New to SR but somewhat a veteran in the game, my best opinion is to order domestically or within your neighboring countries.

				Been on the road since around October and only had issues 2/3 times, but never to the extent where I&#039;ve not received the product. Mainly with people advertising certain delivery times but not turning the product over in that time. Laziness I guess.<br /><br />Stick with it.

				I was a part of the forums and SR for over a month before I finally made my first purchase. I did a lot of research into each and every vendor that I thought of doing business with. I messaged them prior to any business being done.. It doesn&#039;t show on this name or on SR, because I had to make a new username. I spent so much time researching, I forgot my PIN and had to make a new account, lol. <br /><br />I&#039;ve since made 5 purchases with 4 different vendors.. They have all been great as far as customer service. 3 of them the shipping was very quit.&nbsp; One of them is still in transit and I&#039;ll update on the vendor when I get the package. Should be here tomorrow.

If a vendor is not going to take or make the time to &quot;advertise&quot;, then in my opinion it shows that that they don&#039;t have much faith in their product. If you&#039;ve ever been in sales then you want advertisement, you want people to know that you put effort into being the best of the best and making sure your product is the what you say it is. Being able to handle open criticisms shows character and that the vendor is willing to listen to the negative so they can become a better vendor.&nbsp;

I&#039;ve been here for at least a month before I started ordering and in the beginning I thought I had found good quality vendors, but when continuing to read on the forums I quickly came to another opinion. Reviews on SR are not as reliable as reviews on the forums by more than a few trusted posters. So guys with 51 post claiming here that god himself has made the product probably aren&#039;t real.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This^ research is key. <br />

We know, buyers can be tough. They go after the stealth level, the quickness, the quality, and the communication. <br /><br />With an official vendor review thread any missteps will quickly bleed out into the forums. You get whipped quick and it&#039;s part of the new vendor hazing process. In all this anonymity, it&#039;s the closest thing we have to honest, lengthy reviews and it&#039;s the hallmark of a top-notch vendor IMO.

				It&#039;s not just advertising, it&#039;s also good information for a vendor to heed.&nbsp; Feedback ratings are bullshit, and can be manipulated, but people can be honest in the forums because their forum names can be different from their SR names, so they can be anonymous to the vendor.&nbsp; Of course we all hope that our review threads are full of positive things, but if something is going wrong, I want to know about it so that I can correct it, and a forum review thread is a great way to get that information.<br /><br />Also, you can set one up in the amount of time that it takes to post a comment about how you don&#039;t have time to set one up. Just saying.

				This is highly uncharacteristic of&nbsp; the good vendors on SR. Either you&#039;re ordering a lot from countries that are halfway around the world from you or you just don&#039;t know what a &quot;reputable&quot; vendor is. 100 transactions? Not a reputable vendor. 200 transactions &lt;97-98% feedback? Not a reputable vendor. Optimally, you want a guy with a (99) or (100) next to his name (I&#039;m usually able to find a 100 guy) with &gt;300 transactions done and &gt;300 fans. Well-known, well-reviewed. You can flip through feedback and check, for god&#039;s sake.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t know how this happened to you; seriously, the only thing I can think of is that you need to revise your buying habits. A smart buyer is going to get his product 99% of the time, period.

				The fact that this stirred up so much soliciting from vendors is quite amusing. Let your product speak for itself. Advertising outside your personal thread is quite desperate-sounding. Don&#039;t take it to heart - it&#039;s just my opinion, but as we know the top vendors aren&#039;t running around the forums asking people to try their product. They&#039;re busy filling the copious amounts of orders they get.

As far as the rest of your &quot;opinion&quot; on how I order, your way off. I only order domestic, only order high rated, however product specific its not easy to find what you want from a mega seller with 100% and 6,000 fans. I do the best I can and when someone has perfect 5 stars from last 20 orders and no negatives, one should be able to normally assume its a pretty good chance of receiving orders...<br /><br />All I can say is that Ive encountered more BS vendors on SR by a MILE than any other web service. There is a reason for that (I don&#039;t know exactly why) but needs to be worked on in a way that discourages all these scammers flooding in.
