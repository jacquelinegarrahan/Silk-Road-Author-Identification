				I have to say, acquiring BitCoin has been the most difficult part of this whole process BY FAR. With that being said, I finally think I may have found out what I am going to do to purchase the coins, but have some questions as far as what happens next.<br /><br />I think I am going to use BitMe because they will allow me to deposit Ca$h via a Chase bank. I would much prefer to use Bank of America but unfortunately there are none around where I live. <br /><br />So alright, once I get the coins at BitMe... I know I have to transfer them to Silk road somehow. My question is... can I transfer them directly from BitMe or should I transfer them first to my wallet at BlockChain, Then to SR from there.<br /><br />I really would like to get everything rolling tomorrow. I would go today but Chase is closed on Sundays :(. Hopefully, fingers crossed I can place some orders tomorrow and have them by Wednesday or Thursday. <br /><br />Thanks everybody

				i would wire them to some disposable wallet first, after that into sr<br />can&#039;t say if it&#039;s really necessary security-wise, but then it certainly can&#039;t hurt to obscure the trail a bit<br /><br />https://instawallet.org<br />https://easywallet.org, just in case you would like some more options - i&#039;ve used them both<br /><br /><br />good luck

				It never hurts to be extra cautious. Obviously the bigger the order the more steps you want to take. <br /><br />Wish you happy traveling.

				also, this might be of relevance to you, i don&#039;t know if it&#039;s actually true though:<br /><br />&quot;Blockchain.info no longer sending anonymous to sr?&quot;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126419.0<br />

				Hey all, thank you for your responses.<br /><br />Basically, once I buy BitCoin on BitMe... will I be able to transfer the funds from there into SR? I am not talking necessarily about the most cautious/safe way anymore at this point. I want to be able to get something this week, if at all possible. If I can transfer funds from BitMe to SR... unless that&#039;s not possible or not advised, I think I will just go ahead and do that. I need something for the headache that BitCoin has caused me lol

				Yes you can. SR tumbles coins before they hit your SR wallet and again when sent to a vendor.<br /><br />

				So technically if I was to buy the coins as myself at MtGox, <br />then transfer them to a disposable wallet that I set up through Tor or public wifi, <br />then send them from that wallet to SR (again TOR or public wifi) they should be reasonably untraceable .... and even if they were traced back to me there is plenty of plausible deniability.&nbsp; And the risk is still very low since it would only be a few hundred bucks a month<br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp;

				I think some people are too paranoid lol <br /><br />Just buy the bitcoins, transfer them to a website for wallets that allows you to transfer anonymously, transfer anonymously to SR. I don&#039;t see why it should ever be any harder than that until there are new laws that forbids bitcoins in certain places in the world, but I hope that never happens and as long as they increasingly become used for very legitimate legal reasons it shouldn&#039;t be for a long time.

				How long on average would it take to do the whole process, from cash --&gt; BitMe (for example) --&gt; convert USD to BitCoin --&gt; transfer from BitMe to another wallet such as... BlockChain (even though I am still meaning to check out the link someone posted earlier in this thread about how BlockChain may no longer be anoynmous? gotta check that out) then finally into SR escrow. Hypothetically. Sounds like it will be a day, at the very least (which sucks)<br /><br />And @Sensei, yes, sorry, I am a bit paranoid before doing this the first time. Something about having contraband delivered anywhere makes me wanna make sure I have all my bases covered and haven&#039;t made a mistake. I think I will be fine, but you know, I just don&#039;t want to regret ever thinking that for any reason. I am careful, and always have been. Never has failed me.

				not counting the time you will have to wait for the cash -&gt; BitMe move, i would say about 4 hours.<br />the last transfer to silkroad usually takes longest, about 3 hours on average (less maybe, depending on traffic)

				I used Coinbase, that way I could purchase BTC with my bank account and it took three days to verify, but it was easy from that point on! Transferred the BTC to my &quot;wallet&quot; here and WHAM! Now I am buying away. Coinbase is a Beta version, but so far I can&#039;t say enough about it, but you must be patient.

				Sigh... -.- <br /><br />I woke up this morning with the intention to get on BitMe and get about $150 USD in BitCoin. BitMe will only let you get $500 in BitCoin a month MAX (pretty sure, something like that) ... and yet I get on now and it&#039;s telling me &quot;You are unable to deposit the minimum required amount at this time&quot;. <br /><br />I am so incredibly frustrated by this whole process I am about to just give up. It doesn&#039;t seem like I can use cash to buy BitCoin anywhere. I got a PM a while back from this user named AmericanBitcoins, I may check into that again. I never wanted to go through him because of all the BitCoin scams floating around.
