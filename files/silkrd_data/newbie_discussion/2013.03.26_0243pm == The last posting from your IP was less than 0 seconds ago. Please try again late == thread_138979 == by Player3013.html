				Just a forum bug I think. Very annoying though, a bit like the &quot;two people have posted since you clicked reply&quot; message. <br /><br />Just copy your post before clicking submit in case the bug causes you to lose it and having to re write.

				That&#039;s because a lot of people are connected to the same proxy I think. You&#039;re using the Tor Browser package right? Go to the traybar (next to the clock), click the onion. Click Stop Top. Then Start it again and you&#039;ll have a different IP. Hopefully you won&#039;t have much problems, but remember that many people browse the forums, and there&#039;s a limited number or proxies.
