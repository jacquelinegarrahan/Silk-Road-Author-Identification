				Hey guys I&#039;m hoping to make my first buy in a couple weeks, but i have no idea how to set up my mtgox account so i can put money into it and convert that to bitcoins. I tried yesterday but i am waaayyy fucking lost. I tried to set up an account with Dwolla but they wanted my social security and I sure as hell am not giving that to them. Is there any other ways to convert my money to bitcoins? Could I just lie about my social security? sorry for the dumb questions but I&#039;m seriously lost and just need some people to help out who&#039;ve done it before. Thanks a bunch guys&nbsp; :D :D im excited as hell to start using the road. :)

				Sadly now closed, I used BitFloor/Localtill just a month ago. I was going to use Blockchain/BitInstant originally, but the higher fees persuaded me to go with BitFloor. I guess next time I need to fund up I&#039;ll be using Blockchain/BitInstant.<br /><br />The cool thing is that funding is as simple as visiting a Bank of America branch and making a deposit, no ID required at any point.<br /><br />Be sure to do all your site registrations through Tor. BitInstant has a BC tumber service for a fee, but there is a tumbler built into SR. Transferring between a few wallets or bitcoinfog is recommended for maximum security.&nbsp;

				so can someone walk this thru with me so i can buy .1 bitcoins and get the hang of things? Sorry for being a complete fucktard.&nbsp; So I&#039;m at bitinstant and its asking where i want to pay from. I want to convert my cash into bitcoins so should i choose local deposit locations? then it asks for where to pay to. That should be bitcoin address but I have no idea what to put for the address. So those two to start.

				Are Blockchain.info wallets safe?&nbsp; I thought I read about someone hacking their wallets not to long ago. Fuck I have a problem trusting any of these online wallets. Not that I know too much about it. I have been using Bitinstant directly to SR BTC address. Has worked great so far<br />&nbsp;???

				Wallet &quot;safety&quot; shouldn&#039;t be an issue if you&#039;re just buying coins then transferring directly between wallets, eventually to SR (I think its unnecessary to transfer your coins between multiple wallets), if you dont mind paying extra for speed, try localbitcoins.com, or bitbargain.com (Only use trusted sellers)&nbsp;

				Ya the act of buying bitcoins is in no way illegal. Better yet (as far as I know, but could be wrong) any information that a transaction ever went down on SR isn&#039;t stored anywhere for very long. So after a bit, its like nothing ever happened through the site. I think.

But hey, the IRS is full of politically and morally corrupt cocksuckers. Good luck with that.<br /><br />BTC is currently under attack by U.S. DHS, with other nations planning similar steps to curtail BTC and SR, but the truth of the matter is that at the moment Japan is in control. Satoshi Nakamoto--and every BTC miner--controls the market, and thus, they control the (legal) future of BTC.<br /><br />IT and computer professionals are now the arbiters of BTC.

				Haha i know understand how they work but I still don&#039;t understand how to get it. When I get to Bitinstant where do I pay from. I know I want to pay to a bitcoin address ( that would just be the address on my SR page) but I just don&#039;t understand were and how to &quot;pay from&quot;

				add your items to your cart. click on your cart button to go to the cart screen. select the type of shipping you want and update that. then enclose your encrypted gpg address for shipping and hit the button. i cant remember what its called exactly. it should be pretty straight forward. you cannot FE your purchase until the seller marks it in transit

				you order has been placed<br />processing means hes packing it up and getting it ready for shipping<br />when he ships it, he will come back and update. then it will say in-transit<br />at this point the finalize button becomes available. DO NOT HIT IT<br />also you will see another button available called resolve. you would use this if you have a problem with your package like it doesnt show up or something<br />once you package arrives in the mail, then you sign on to SR and hit the finalize button<br />when you hit finalize, you complete the sale. the resolve button goes away and its considered a done deal. so best to wait until you have your package in hands!<br />
