				Ordered a half gram of stuff Sunday night, got the package this afternoon.&nbsp; .91 grams with the bag, and after a small test line I can safely say this stuff is clean, and potent too.

				Quote from my vendors homepage:<br /><br />&quot;<br />★New Silk Road Users★<br />- Clients must have at least 4 transactions totaling at least $150 before ordering.<br />Anything less than this, the user must contact us BEFORE placing an order or it will be immediately cancelled.<br />We usually attempt to be accommodating with New Users. Depending on variables, of course<br /><br /><br />We reserve the right to cancel any transactions including users with auto finalize,a high refund rate, a lingering smell of bacon or if you are from Minnesota(Fuck Minnesota)<br />If we haven&#039;t provided 5 out of 5 service please let us know before leaving feedback so we may have a chance to improve the situation.&quot;<br /><br />New folks just need to contact us before ordering, very rarely is there ever a problem selling to new people. Just want to touch base with them first.&nbsp; SDS
