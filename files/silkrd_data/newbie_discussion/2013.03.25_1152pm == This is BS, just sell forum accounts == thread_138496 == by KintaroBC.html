				50 posts to post elsewhere now? I can see ups and downs. A while ago when I was active on here, there was this big spam thing going on where new accounts would pop up with the name like HIGYIGYIGF or some shit, and they would spam the shit out of every forum with bullshit bitcoin sites trying to phis for CC info, etc. So, this stops that, however, I can see the frustration of being a new member to the forums and having to make 50 posts just to post elsewhere. At least the mods allow spam threads.

				I am a long time SR member but only recently made a Forum account (wish they could be linked)<br /><br />but i am willing to put in my time and be patient to get to 50 on my own its really only a few posts per day and <br /><br />im online all the time anyway :/<br /><br />but i wonder how much an account with <br />lets say 51 posts <br />would sell for or if the all powerful SR admins would have something to say about that...<br /><br />-Jackofspades

				It&#039;s not BS its a good rule. I just saw some dweeb spam his way to 50 (50 posts of nothing but spam), then go straight to another forum and ask a newbie question, which could have easily been answered in the newbie forum.

				I am really busy at it is with processing orders and whatnot as a vendor.<br />Having to make 50 posts to actually post in other parts, to make a review thread and so forth.<br /><br />It just takes way too much time, would definitely prefer to just pay for the privilege.

				I dont think 50 posts is to hard to get, I really think it says your serious when you get to 50 posts without spamming or anything like that
