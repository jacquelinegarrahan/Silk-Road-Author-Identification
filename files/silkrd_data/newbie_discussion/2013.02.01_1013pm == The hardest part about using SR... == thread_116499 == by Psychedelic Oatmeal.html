				...is deciding what to buy. I&#039;m real keen on getting some &#039;cid, as the two times I&#039;ve had it were rather lackluster (well the first time was really fun but in retrospect I&#039;m pretty sure it was an RC. Second time the tabs were weak as fuck). But, acid prices are kind of high for my income. Shrooms, however, are cheap as shit compared to local prices. I also have the urge to try DMT, meth and heroin.<br /><br />So, SR users, what the fuck do I want to buy?

				If the price on acid is to high for your income then good H is way of my friend...<br /><br />But when you decide that your soul is worth more than food on the table then do like so many others (me) and buy it ;)<br />Both ice and H are the most &quot;long lasting&quot; drugs, according to me. You get allot for your money, a g of good ice last for a week, and I mean a week of no sleep, so its game on the whole time. H can last just as long if u use every day and you´r a newbie, use like a &quot;normal&quot; person and you will get at least two awesome weekends out of each one.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				The monetary risk. I guess it all depends on how you use SR.

Also I want to try MDMA, but no pill bullshit. The time I got some molly I had 2 pills, swallowed one and let the other dissolve about halfway on my tongue 45 minutes later. I felt nothing but couldn&#039;t fall asleep and I felt like I got hit like a train the next day. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion oral is a fucking shitty ROA for the majority of drugs (personally). Every time I eat a drug it&#039;s wasted. Weed edibles, vicodin, codeine, mdma, all taken and felt nothing.<br /><br />I&#039;m rambling. I just like discussing drugs&nbsp; ::)

				H is a pretty strange thing to do in place of acid.&nbsp; I wish someone would sell some real mescaline, that would be sweet.&nbsp; The only thing i&#039;ve seen on sr under the mescaline category was one listing for some cactus powder (whether san pedro or peyote i didnt check).&nbsp; I wonder if there was ever a vendor with mescaline

				For &#039;price-per-dose&#039; I&#039;ve found these to be good value.<br /><br />mxe<br />2c-b<br />mephedrone<br />GHB<br />5-meo-dmt<br /><br />H and mdma seem to be pretty good as well for price.
