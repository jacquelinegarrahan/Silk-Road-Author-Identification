			<dd class="postbody">
				Just wanted to say hello here.&nbsp; I am new and have enjoyed it thus far. Lots of great vendors and lots of great info on forums...which makes my question about shipping somewhat undecided yet.<br /><br /><br />Ive seen use MBB and Heat Foil bags. Which sounds like a great idea that i will be trying, but im trying to get a lil more clarification on this....<br /><br /><br />Ive seen debates about vac sealing and then heat foiling etc.<br /><br />What order would you do it in? Vac seal with MBB then Heat Foil? Or any other suggestions<br /><br />Secondly ive seen some of the shipping flat pouches on the road here, but are there any decent places to order off web? As the vendors i see with these shipping pouches are overseas from me, and will take quite some time to get here. I know that ordering MBB and Heat Foil are totally legit, but i dont want to order from a site that might raise a red flag in other words...so any suggestions on where to order these other than the road?<br /><br /><br />Last but not least. Ive seen all kinds of post about Vac&#039;ing the MBB where it is a pain in the ass? Is there a sealer that you reccomend? And im not looking at spending alot of money on a sealer. Just a good sealer and a easy sure shot way to vac seal MBB.<br /><br />Any help with these questions would be greatly appreciated...<br /><br /><br />thanks, lesmiles
