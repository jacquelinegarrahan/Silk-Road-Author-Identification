				Hey everyone, I am a new seller on here (CannabisKing) and I already have a few notes to share with buyers, seeing how I haven&#039;t found them yet in the forum section. <br /><br />I would strongly recommend <br /><br />A) ordering early in the week<br />B) ordering in the morning<br /><br />The reason for A is that as a buyer, you want your mail in the postal service&#039;s hands the least amount of time possible. Having it sit around on sunday only allowed those MBB and vacuum sealed bags to become more and more permeable. By ordering on a Monday or Tuesday, you will most likely not have your package sitting around on a weekend while the services are closed. The less time in the mail the better, this is one way to avoid that.<br /><br />The reason for B involves your shipping information. The less time your shipping information is out there, the better for you. By ordering in the morning, the seller should be able to ship that same day, which of course right after shipping they are to delete the address immediately! <br /><br />Anyways, like I said, I am new to SR as a seller but I thought I would share my 2 cents on it seeing how I haven&#039;t seen anything else about it on the forums (yet) and I have been researching the forums for months now.<br /><br />Peace, and if you need some dank bud on the cheap, search for CannabisKing! ha
