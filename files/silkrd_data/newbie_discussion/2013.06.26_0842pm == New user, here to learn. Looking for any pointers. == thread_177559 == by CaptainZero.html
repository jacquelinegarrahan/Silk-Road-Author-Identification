				Hi everyone. Just wanted to introduce myself and ask some questions. I&#039;m a long time, and generally semi in control user of a few substances, though I&#039;ve had some rough patches. Opiates, psychedelics, occasional stimulants and just in the last 5 years, cannabis. I&#039;m a musician and a family man and a neophile. There are some substances that I&#039;d like to try, that I&#039;ll never find anywhere else but SR. I moved away from the city and I have lost contact with any sort of scene that could lead me to novel substances. <br />&nbsp; I&#039;m here to learn as much about Silk Road, its rules and methods as possible. I&#039;m so happy that it exists and want to use it properly.<br />&nbsp; I plan on reading as much as possible on this board, every post if I need to. I&#039;ve already read the stickies at the top of this sub forum, and plan on reading them again. Any recommended reading? Indispensable posts, important topics? <br />&nbsp;I plan on learning as much as I can about security, pgp, bitcoin and safety before making my first order. Are there any posts or faq&#039;s that outline a path to the successful use of SR? I&#039;m not looking for quick shortcuts, but also don&#039;t want to waste too much time on useless info. I&#039;d like to optimize my research.<br />&nbsp;Thanks for your help. I hope I can be a useful member of this community.<br />CaptainZero

				InI am new myself. i have only ordered benzo&#039;s and painkillers mostly. Be careful who you deal with. Don&#039;t finalize early, ever. Have bought from mdpro several times without a problem. I would definitely recommend him. Other than that, pay attention to vendor stats. Hope this helps you even a little.

				I agree, don&#039;t FE, read the forums, order early in the week to minimize shipping storage. Let me know if you need some green. ha

				I&#039;d advise you to never try to buy BTC on SR. It&#039;s the easiest way to scam a buyer. <br /><br />Definitely keep up with threads on your drug(s) of choice, as well as vendor review threads. Read older posts in big threads to get a feel for who&#039;s been around a long time, plays nice with others, and isn&#039;t prone to rants and freakouts. If one of these people reports a scam, recommends a vendor, etc, you can give their opinion more weight. When someone with 51 posts, 50 of which are spam, starts a thread or posts in ALL CAPS about being scammed, or starts dropping rave reviews all over the forums for a newer vendor, you can and should ignore them. You get the picture - do your homework so you know who to give a bit of trust.<br /><br />Never trust anyone here completely. Accounts get hacked, or bad shit happens IRL and a vendor needs $$$ fast and scams in desperation. Don&#039;t risk more than you can afford to lose, especially if you buy here for resale offline.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be a dick. Karma isn&#039;t a number under your name. :)<br /><br />That&#039;s about all I got. It sounds like you already have the right idea and are proceeding with due care. Keep that up, and you&#039;ll be alright.<br />

				Never FE and only order off reputable vendors to start. Always check most recent forum reviews and order from sellers who are forum active. Keep it safe, keep it real.
