				I&#039;ve noticed that some sellers have tracking codes for their customers. How do you pull this off, without having to show your (or someone else his) face at the postal office? Is this even possible?<br /><br />P.S. From the vendors and buyers perspective.

				The seller should provide you with a tracking number and you just go to the website of whatever company they chose to use to deliver... they also give direct links.. no need to go to the post office

				Don&#039;t be pissed, though, if a seller doesn&#039;t have that policy.&nbsp; Not providing the number means some numbnuts can&#039;t post in feedback &quot;Got from Florida to my house in North Jersey in 3 days! Woo-hoo!&quot;

				Is it safer to use Torr for the tracking?<br />Or does this set off alarms?

				It depends on how much you trust Silk Road vs TORMail, honestly.&nbsp; If a seller has an option to provide a tracking number, I have no problem with him sending it to my SR private message inbox.&nbsp;

				I had a guy tell me once not to search the tracking code through the shippers website on the clearnet. they can see who looked at the tracking code and link it back to your isp. but of course Tor should take care of that problem. right?

				In my opinion checking tracking unless the package is over 10 business days late is a big compromise in secuirty for everyone involved. <br /><br />Especially through tor. Use a public wifi or a hacked wifi adderss.

				DO NOT TRACK YOUR PACKAGES THROUGH TOR.&nbsp; This can result in the pack being flagged.<br /><br />go use public WiFi or something

				Yes I am a noob when it comes to tracking and admit I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m talking about using one of those online services that you can track UPS, USPS, FedEx, ect. They are not the official sites from any of those but a 3rd party service tracking site. I&#039;m not noob enough to try any of those without asking the question on here for some honest discussion.

				I&#039;d say forget about tracking.<br />The need to sign for a delivery is dangerous. Avoid registered mail.

My experience has been that not all packages from dutch webshops needed to be signed, but some did. Not sure why.
