				I think the American people will use TOR more now with this recent scandal, and the more TOR users, the harder to profile individual ones.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				I think so too.&nbsp; We should all take the time to advertise the awesomeness of the TOR so that everyone uses it.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d tick all three options in your poll if I could. Well, the first two for sure.<br /><br />First, more Tor users is only half the answer, or even less than that. What is crucial is more independent relays. Search &quot;jacob appelbaum not my department&quot;, a 29C3 talk (JA is a Tor developer/evangelist). I&#039;m sure the NSA, too, is participating in the Tor network, by running relays and exit nodes, as any self-respecting intelligence agency should.<br /><br />Second, governments have been getting away with this for a long time. A lot has been written about Wikileaks and Manning, and we&#039;re slowly starting to forget them, surrendering the memory to our digital collective consciousness, thinking the memory will be there if someone flips a switch. That video I suggesed to search, you didn&#039;t watch it on YouTube, did you?<br /><br />Third, and most important. This is not about the American people. This is about everybody.

				Seriously, I do not understand why people continue to give facebook every aspect of their lives and then believe that the &quot;privacy&quot; policy will protect them.

				&nbsp;:o :o :o :o :o :o :o<br /><br />True Story; <br /><br />I had deleted a fedbook account a while back.&nbsp; One drunken night I mistakenly inserted my email and password, (a whole year or more latter) and guess what!?<br /><br />My fedbook was reactivated and took off right were I left off last time.&nbsp; Shit was ultra scarry that they had that info for a whole freaking year and still didn&#039;t dispose of it as claimed when deactivating.&nbsp; &nbsp; Anymore I figured just start all over and begin w/ all new mail and what not.&nbsp; I only use TOR now and use clearnet just to keep in touch with those who haven&#039;t made the leap over into TOR yet.&nbsp; Though I&#039;ve threatened everyone if they don&#039;t hurry up and learn PGP and use TOR they&#039;ll never get to communicate w/ me again via any means.&nbsp;
