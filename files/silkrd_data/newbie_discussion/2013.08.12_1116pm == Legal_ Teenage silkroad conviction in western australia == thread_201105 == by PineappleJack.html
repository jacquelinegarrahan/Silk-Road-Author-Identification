				http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/18437383/first-wa-convictions-for-silk-road-trades/<br /><br />&quot;Two of the convictions were against brothers aged 15 and 17, after police from the technology crime unit and Esperance detectives ran Operation Cinder late last year. The juveniles were jailed by the Perth Children&#039;s Court for a maximum of 12 months on more than a dozen charges of possessing 6.8g of cannabis, 0.7g of cocaine and seven ecstasy pills with intent to sell and supply. A 26-year-old man, who was charged with attempting to possess drugs from the site, was fined $1000.&quot;<br /><br />An earlier article: http://au.news.yahoo.com/local/wa/a/-/local/14980079/brothers-in-court-over-online-drugs/<br /><br />&quot;The boys&#039; parents approached Esperance police because they were concerned at packages they were receiving through the mail. Staff at the local Australia Post sorting depot had also become concerned. Detectives launched an investigation dubbed Operation Cinder and identified the source of the drugs as The Silk Road.&quot;<br /><br />Not exactly sure what the link to the 26yr old is....

				&quot; &quot;Parents who do not actively monitor what sites their children use on computers and smart phones shouldn&#039;t be surprised when police execute a search warrant or charge their son with serious offences,&quot; Det-Sen. Sgt Troy Douglas said.&quot;<br /><br />Good luck with that. The only reason the kids were caught was because the parents turned them in. Great job mom and dad, you just ruined your kids lives over a few grams of prohibited substances.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty sad the police are taking credit for this &quot;operation cinder&quot; arrest, that only eventuated because the kids parents approached leo. In reality it demonstrates that the police have a hard time busting SR users who operate safely and anonymously.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Parents don&#039;t realise how little sympathy police have for drug crimes, they want easy arrest stats. Parents often think they&#039;re helping their kids, and that by being good, concerned parents talking to leo that the police will just give their kids a scare&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;An extreme example is Scott Rush&#039;s (Bali 9 infamy) parents, who alerted Aus Fed Police to the smuggling op. The feds, instead of intervening before hand, or even waiting until the kids returned home with the drugs and busting them then, told Indonesian authorities. Now that kid&#039;s lucky he&#039;s only got life imprisonment in a hell hole Indonesian jail. He was sentenced to death... Imagine being that guy&#039;s parents.
