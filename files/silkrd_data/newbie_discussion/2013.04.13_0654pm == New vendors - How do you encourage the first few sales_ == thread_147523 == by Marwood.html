				I recently listed some product for the first time but have no sales yet. <br /><br />Obviously I have zero feedback so I have placed my prices very competitively but until I get those first couple of sales and some positive feedback what can I do? <br /><br />I don&#039;t blame people for using tried and trusted vendors but everyone has to start somewhere. Any tips?

Additionally, find members who post in the review threads for benzos and are willing to sample and review your product. Get good reviews, others will follow.

				Get to 50 posts and offer free samples on the main forum. I doubt many people have even seen your listings at the moment.

				You can catch people with the wording you use. Some vendors are doing frequent buyers things, I also saw some one where they have samples for X amount of $, and then when you place a real order you get that money back towards your order or you get extra stuff

				Have a good forum presence. Most buyers (well the smart ones anyways) will not only check reviews but search the forums for reviews and warnings about vendors before making an informed purchase. Make your vendor page informative and not flashy. Good luck with all your endeavors.

				Thanks. I&#039;ve so far refrained from posting in all the spam threads just to get my post count up because it&#039;s a bit crass and I&#039;ve learned a lot whilst doing so.

				Yeah getting to 50 without spamming is quite the annoying task. I&#039;d order your sampler and do a review but I&#039;m not from the UK :p if you ever go international I&#039;d gladly order some Benzo&#039;s from you though.

				I thought about it but I would have to look into international postage and then there&#039;s hassle with customs on the buyers end.
