				So I recently engaged in a transaction with a vendor with good stats and had good things to say on his seller page about shipping, communication, etc. Well the seller didn&#039;t live up to his part of the deal and left me very unhappy with the transaction. The seller also had on his page that if you felt satisfactory fell below 5/5 to contact him to make things right. Well i did this and let him know of my unsatisfactory and his response was he got busy and sorry get over it. Well i let him know that i was going to leave honest feedback about the transaction and he responded by saying that he would basically blackmail me by giving me a &quot;Suspicious/Irresponsible Buyer&quot; label. Now what can I do in this situation? I am relatively new here on the road and i have about 12 transactions with no refunds or autofinalizes. I want to be honest in my feedback but how can he give me that label and won&#039;t it badly affect my ability to buy from many established sellers? Please help and offer any advice if anyone on here has a similar experience or knows how this process works of getting this label. Thanks.

				You do not say why exactly you weren&#039;t happy with the transaction. It&#039;s hard to help you without that information.

				I&#039;m a noob on the road with just a few purchases but there seems to be a trend with some to subjugate the buyer by making him FE, give good ratings, 5/5 or the vendor will leave a bad rating for him/not sell to/not resell to. Many of them convey the tone of a child in their terms and conditions. <br />As buyers in general will make less transactions than vendors, this unspoken threat carries more weight and the vendor knows it. <br />We should communicate with vendors as business people, there&#039;s nothing wrong with being hard nosed about it.<br /><br />If you already have 12 good purchases you should be ok on ordering,lots of sellers i have seen will only ask for FE on +15% resend/refund.

				As a client you should be up front with your vendors. its my opinion that this should be done via PGP messages to try and resolve the issue first. if that fails then you can take it to the ratings system.<br /><br />just be prepared for the backlash if the vendor feels slighted. remember some people are not always on the level, especially when it comes to underground transactions.

				Thanks for the replies guys. The issues were in communication and shipping. The seller claimed in his seller page that he had stellar communication and fast shipping but took over 4 days to reply to my messages and ship my item and a week later I still don&#039;t have my item. I had no intention of killing his feedback rating over something this trivial I just wanted to let him know that if he isn&#039;t willing to do what his seller page says he will do then he needs to revise his seller page because the reason I purchased from him in the first place was because of what he had to say in his seller page and I felt I would receive my order in a timely manner. Really the thing that bothered me the most was he clearly states on his seller page that if a buyer feels the transaction went below a 5 to let him know and he would work to make things right. Well after contacting him his reply to me was pretty much sorry i got busy and just get over it. Then came the threat of putting me on the black list of buyers if i left poor feedback. Well after some consideration I have just decided to let it all go and leave 5 of 5 feedback with no comments. As much as that bothers me to do that I know that the way he conducts business it won&#039;t take long for him to wrong enough customers so his rating goes so low he won&#039;t have any business at all. Hell in the past 24 hours his rating has fallen from a 99 to a 94 because another buyer he did wrong left him poor feedback so I feel in the end these things will work themselves out and vendors who don&#039;t take their business serious will be out of business. But it also got me thinking that there is always the threat that a vendor has a buyer&#039;s address and could spite them for leaving honest, poor feedback by reporting them to local authorities anonymously and screw a buyer over. It just has me thinking you never know what a crazy, vengeful vendor could do but in the end if nothing else he lost an honest buyer who would have been a repeat customer and I&#039;ll just take my business elsewhere. That being said almost all of the vendors I&#039;ve dealt with on the road have been upstanding professionals and I am very glad to be a part of this great thing we all got going here.&nbsp;

				Well I&#039;ve tried contacting him again with a message saying lets just agree to disagree on the matter and neither one of us try and do anything that is going to hurt the other here on the road and I&#039;m really just looking for a sincere apology instead of this i got busy get over it its not that big of a deal crap. But that message was 36 hours ago and I can see it hasn&#039;t been read and I know the road has been down a lot so I&#039;m trying to give him the benefit of the doubt but I would hope he gets back in touch with me soon and is happy I&#039;m willing to just let it all go but if I get the silent, ignore treatment or my package doesn&#039;t arrive in 7 business days when i paid priority on top of everything else I may look into contacting SR. How do I go about contacting them over a dispute?

				In this type of situation the best thing to do is just leave them their 5/5, but indicate in the feedback you were not satisfied with their communications nor their delivery based on the promise they made on their profile page.<br /><br />It&#039;s not worth getting into a fight over it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure why it is, but there seem to be a lot of vendors who simply don&#039;t get the concept of priority shipping.&nbsp; They don&#039;t seem to realize we order priority because we want the product quickly, not simply because we want to track the package.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had too many vendors think it&#039;s OK to take an order for priority shipping then take 5 days to put it in the mail.<br /><br />On the other hand, being threatened with a blacklist if you don&#039;t leave 5/5 feedback is wrong.&nbsp; You do have the option of clicking on the &#039;report vendor&#039; button for something like that. <br /><br />To report a vendor, go to their profile page and click on the &#039;Report This Vendor&#039; button.&nbsp; Make sure you have copies of all your correspondence with the vendor and anything else you feel relevant.<br />
