				Hey everybody, I have just joined.<br /><br />Questions.<br /><br />I saw a thread which was titled &quot;I think I just got CD&#039;d&quot;<br />What does CD mean?<br /><br />I am from Australia (not sure if this is bad to post my country) and am looking to purchase some bud from SR<br /><br />My questions are;<br />Qho is the best aus seller? I was looking to buy from AussieUnderground<br />Has anyone bought from AussieUnderground?<br />How good was the weed?<br />How good was it stealth packed?<br /><br />General question <br /><br />Is the weed from all vendors all what it seems? When I look at SR I look at it and think, god this shit is probably just like the stuff American or Netherlands would have at their shops.<br />Is that what it&#039;s like compared to your typical Australian weed?<br /><br />I read on a thread someone saying if you get asked to sign for your package you should not sign and just take the loss and they usually have an undercover cop give you the package if it gets caught.<br />First off, I receive usually 1 package a month (sometimes 2 or 3) from the post van with stuff from ebay, I know what the guy looks like and I have never had a different person, it is always the same. If I do sign I will most likely not open the package for a few hours.<br /><br />So, do I sign for it if I have to?<br /><br /><br />I will only be buying 3 grams since it is my first purchase, if I was caught by the cops with the 3grams would I even get in trouble considering it&#039;s such a low amount or would the charges be worse since it was shipped?<br /><br />That is all, thanks for any replys,input and advice.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				CD means controlled delivery. A controlled delivery is when your package is discovered and LE (law enforcement) delivers it to your door under the disguise of a postal worker. Once you sign and accept the package they bust in your house the same day and search the place. For 3 grams of weed this would be EXTREMELY unlikely. If you order internationally and your package gets seized by customs you get what is called a &quot;love letter&quot;, which is just a letter from customs telling you that they took your drugs. <br /><br />In the unlikely scenario that your package is discovered, remember to DENY DENY DENY. Anybody can send anybody anything. I could send a box of dead babies to somebody I don&#039;t like. Even if you sign for it you could say that you were expecting a package from Ebay. If the mailman looks suspicious that day just sign for it, put the package on your table and write &quot;return to sender&quot; in black marker, so that if LE busts in your house later you can say that you didn&#039;t order it and were planning to return it. <br /><br />But again 3 grams of weed is nothing. Take a look around the forums, there&#039;s lots of other useful info. Good luck on the road!

				Also, revealing your country is perfectly okay. <br /><br />Escrow is the system through which you make payments. For example: You order a platypus from vendor A. Your bitcoins then go into the escrow system where they are held until your package arrives, which ensures that the vendor won&#039;t just take your money and not send your package. When your platypus arrives you click &quot;finalize&quot; on your order, which releases the bitcoins and vendor A gets paid. The vendor may request that you FE (finalize early), which means that you give the vendor the money before you receive the package, but this is an easy way to get scammed. NEVER finalize early.

I understand buy doing that the selling can&#039;t rip you off but the buyer can, so what happens when the buyer rips the seller off? No I am not planning to rip anyone off over 3 grams xD I am just curious. Also what happens if the seller rips the buying off if someone was to FE?

After 20ish days have passed since you placed your order the escrow system auto-finalizes your payment, so the vendor gets your money anyway. The obvious question then is &quot;why don&#039;t vendors just let all of their orders auto-finalize?&quot;...the answer is that after about 10 days since you placed your order you&#039;re given the option to go the resolution center. This is where the buyer and seller, with the help of SR staff, come to an agreement if the package hasn&#039;t arrived or is unsatisfactory. <br /><br />Of course the system has flaws, which is why you should start out by buying small quantities at first to see which vendors you can trust. It would be wise to only buy from vendors who have many transactions and good feedback. Be sure to read each vendor&#039;s refund policy as well. <br /><br />If you FE and the vendor scams you then nothing can be done. If this happens then you should post about it in the forums to lower the vendor&#039;s reputation. Reputation is everything around here.

The OG Kush, Hindu Kush, Albert Walker OG and Jack herer have all been amazing. Jack was a very energetic high.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />
