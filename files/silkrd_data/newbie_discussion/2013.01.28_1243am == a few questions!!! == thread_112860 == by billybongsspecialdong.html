				HI SR!<br /><br />OK so I&#039;m completely new to the SR and have come across a few things I need clarification over. And I apologise if it&#039;s been answered already!!!! :((<br /><br />1. On the Buyer&#039;s Guide it talks about phishing scams. How do I know if i&#039;ve accessed the right SR website? :S I mean would the phishing site tell me about phishing?!!! Sorry if I sound like a complete dumbass!!!! -_-<br />2. I&#039;m from the UK - https://mtgox.com/ - is this a valid bitcoin supplier? If so do i have to sign up using USD? :SSS And can&#039;t whoever trace you by looking at your bitcoin account details? :SS Sorry again if i sound like a dumbasss!!!<br />3. WTF is Escrow?!<br />4. This is gonna sound reaalll dumb! I&#039;ve been reading that peeps who order large amounts of product from the USA etc DONT get caught. when i mean large amounts i mean a few ounces of weed, drone or coke etc. Don&#039;t the fuckers find that shit???!!! Sniffers or anything??!!!!!!!! :SS<br />5. if im ordering domestically will it ever get scanned? or is ordering domestically the safest way to do it?<br />6. If it ever does come to the point that the popo knock at the door and my package isnt opened can they prosecute me? i mean i didnt open it and if they tell me whats in it i could just say WTH i had no idea!!<br /><br />thanks to anyone that answers these questions!!&nbsp; 8)<br />

Memorize the URL.&nbsp; It&#039;s silkroadvb5piz3r.onion, and it should always begin with that.&nbsp; Just always check the URL before you EVER enter ANY passwords or your PIN or order ANYTHING.&nbsp; Other than that, you don&#039;t have much to worry about.<br /><br />2. MtGox is legit, but I have no idea how it works for the UK.&nbsp; I live in the US and I just used BitInstant to do a cash transfer.&nbsp; You print off a slip after you fill out the form, take it to walmart, or walgreens, or CVS, or anywhere with moneygram.&nbsp; You pick up the red phone, enter the numbers on the slip, talk to some Indians and repeat some more numbers on the slip, then pay the cashier at the store.&nbsp; Half an hour later you have coins in your wallet.<br /><br />3. Escrow basically means the vendor doesn&#039;t get your money until you do what&#039;s called &quot;finalizing&quot;.&nbsp; When you receive your order, you finalize, which grants the vendor their money.&nbsp; Until you finalize, your money is in the middle, being held by SR until you finalize or file a complaint.&nbsp; This keeps you safe from scams because if your product doesn&#039;t arrive you can file a dispute and usually get a refund instead of trying to convince a seller to give you your money back.<br /><br />4. Ordering inside your own country is the safest way to go, especially with weed.&nbsp; As long as the vendor vacuum seals and has good packaging, the smell is usually not a problem. The main issue comes with customs, which is only a problem when you ship internationally.&nbsp; Other than that, the US Postal service usually doesn&#039;t find anything unless there&#039;s a reason for it to be suspicious (bad packaging, coming from the Netherlands, smell).&nbsp; If possible, domestic is the way to go.&nbsp; Always check out reviews though and see what people say about their packaging methods.<br /><br />5. If by scanned you mean like an X-Ray, I&#039;m pretty sure domestic orders don&#039;t pass through those, or else a lot more orders would be getting caught.&nbsp; I could be very wrong though, like I said before, domestic is the safest by far.<br /><br />6. If you&#039;re paranoid and want to be SUPER safe:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Write &quot;RETURN TO SENDER&quot; in big letters on the package and DON&#039;T OPEN IT.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Wait a week<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. If nobody comes knocking, you&#039;re safe, if they do, you have plausible deniability (&quot;I have no idea what this address is, I&#039;m not expecting anything so I planned to take it back to the post office tomorrow&quot;)&nbsp; Usually, they&#039;re more interested in getting the package before it even gets to you than busting you with it.

				Hi there! Soo I can&#039;t answer EVERY question, but i&#039;ll try to shed some light<br /><br />1) As long as you enter the SR address exactly as it exists, you will be fine. The Wikipedia link to the SR has been compromised, so don&#039;t use it. When i started out- I would access it through the Silkroad subreddit www.reddit.com/r/silkroad ... then once you&#039;ve reached the login screen, BOOKMARK the page, and you won&#039;t have to worry about phising.<br /><br />2) Mtgox is a great way to get bitcoins, not my preferred method from the US, so i&#039;m not completely sure how it works but I know its established and you&#039;ll be fine using it.<br /><br />3) Escrow essentially means that your payment doesn&#039;t reach the vendor until you say it does. This protects both buyer and seller... So if you buy something, it has 17 days from when its marked &#039;in transit&#039; to get to your doorstep and for you to finalize the order-- finalize means that the bitcions finally reach the vendor. The SR holds onto the coins in &#039;escrow&#039; until&nbsp; you finalize. **Some vendors will ask you to finalize since you are new, do NOT do this... its essentially giving them money, without receiving product** If you&#039;re in the UK, I suggest your first transactions go through vendor: Jesusofrave ... they&#039;re GREAT and very professional<br /><br />4) If vendors ship internationally, they are usually pretty good at disguising their products that they ship. So yes it does happen, but this is but a fraction of a percent of the time.<br /><br />5) Sure you COULD get scammed... but Like i said, stick with Jesusofrave-- he&#039;ll be your domestic best friend for ALL of your drug related needs... no need for you to order anywhere else in my opinion<br /><br />6) If the Law Enforcement come knocking on your door... you &quot;don&#039;t know anything&quot; ... If you buy your btc correctly, encrypt your address with PGP (whole other story, search around for how to do it, great videos on youtube or [https://www.igolder.com/pgp/] is a great way without downloading anything... they have no way to prove that you actually bought the product, only that its there. So if they come, say you know nothing and give them the package.<br /><br />and please, i repeat, NEVER FE, ever ever ever

				1. make a note of the SR address, and check it when you log in. Also, never respond to emails/messages that ask for your password or log-in details. Silk Road will never do this.<br /><br />2. I&#039;m UK too. mtgox is definitely a legitimate organisation. Personally, I use a blockchain wallet, and fund from my bank,viat Barclay&#039;s pingit. <br /><br />3. Escrow is the name given to a kind of virtual holding area. You pay, SR puts the money in escrow/on hold. When you receive yyour goods, SR release the money to the seller. This helps prevent both seller and customer ripping each other off.&nbsp; <br /><br />4. No idea. Order from uk vendors only. (change search setting to &quot;domestic only&quot;). <br /><br />5. Domestic orders are not gonna be looked at by customs. You&#039;re only worry is Royal Mail. Sellers work REALLY HARD at making your package a stealth package. A lot of uk sellers claim to have 100% success rates when posting domestically.<br /><br />6. Either use a different name when ordering and plead ignorance, or ship your goods to another address (drop), like a friend&#039;s house or something.<br /><br />Hope that helps. ★

Just remember to be VERY cautious on the road. What we have going here is amazing- its drug dealing of the future. Lets not let it go to waste via some ignorance. Not saying you will be ignorant in your endeavors... just want to stress the importance of being safe in both buying/doing whatever chemicals you find appealing.

				Hey BBSD<br />The answers to all of your questions have been answered many times over in the forum. Use the search function and spend as much time as you can researching before you do anything that could compromise your freedom or hard earned money.<br /><br />I&#039;m killing time right now so I&#039;ll try and answer a couple of your questions (in no particular order).<br /><br />1. Try not reveal too much about yourself eg. where you live.<br /><br />3. Getting orders into your country from overseas is very possible and happens every day. It depends on many factors - where your delivery is coming from, the quality of the vendor&#039;s stealth etc. Customs are not perfect.<br /><br />4. Buying domestic is generally more expensive but you don&#039;t have the worry of getting a delivery through customs. Of course there are still risks but domestic mail is not subjected to the same scrutiny as overseas mail.<br /><br />5. If the police knock on your door and you have an unopened package containing 5kg of whatever addressed to Joe Bloggs sitting on top of your fridge could they prosecute you? Good question. Every country has different laws regarding these things. <br />Of course you could say &#039;Wasn&#039;t me guv, I&#039;ve never touched drugs in my life. Must have been the previous tenant using this address to get his drugs into the country.&#039; Might work.<br /><br />Anyway, spend time reading the forums, research your vendor, have a safe delivery address. Use the search function!<br /><br /><br />
