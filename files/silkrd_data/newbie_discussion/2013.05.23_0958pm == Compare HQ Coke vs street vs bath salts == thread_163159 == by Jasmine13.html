				Hello all, <br />I need a detailed review of what to expect from a HQ C buzz. I am used to street cola. I like street C, good st c that is!! So I recently got an 8 of &quot;pure uncut&quot; off SR.&nbsp; At first I thought WOW but then I got Really jittery and nauseous. I simply cant decide if its good or not. This is my first &quot;pure cola&quot; purchase. So I have no comparison. Are the highs totally different? Is HQ so strong that some users just wont enjoy? <br />Last night i was doing lines. Wanting another one maybe every 15 min. By the end of the night I was TENSE and uncomfortable. Today I have only done key bumps, no lines. Its definetly got me buzzed but not chatty and my nose fkn hurts!! Last night i was totally plugged up at the end of the night. I dont have 50 posts so I cant put a review out. Plus I dont want to bash vendor if this is in fact good stuff and is just such a different high from street. <br />Also, for all I know this may be bath salts or speed or anything!! A detailed bath salts experience may also be helpful.<br />Any insight would be greatly appreciated!!<br />Thanks! :)

				a high quality cocaine buzz is very nice and euphoric, theres really no way to not love it. you snort some and things just go zoom, cant stop talking, smoking, doing more. its 100% enjoyable except for the after effects when u just want more coke. you should look into regeant testing your C
