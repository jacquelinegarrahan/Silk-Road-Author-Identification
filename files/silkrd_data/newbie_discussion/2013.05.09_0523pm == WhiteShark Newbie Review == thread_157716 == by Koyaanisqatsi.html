				Now, <br />I&#039;m not exactly a newbie, but I can not post in WhiteShark review thread. <br />So, here&#039;s my review. If one mode was kind enough to move it to WhiteShark Review thread (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67348.0), that&#039;d be really nice.<br />Late December 2012, I notice a new weed vendor. Based in Canada. WhiteShark. She seems very honest, I really like the message on her vendor page, the prices are ok, she promises good quality. Oh, and she maybe cooks, since she also sells weed cakes. I must be one of her first customers. <br /><br />First order : <br />I make my first order with her. I trust her enough to FE. <br />I receive my package, from overseas, within a week (I dont remeber exactly).<br />Now, my name and first name are both quite short, but both contain errors. Oh...<br />But it does not make any problem. I go to the post office, retrieve my package, and go back home. <br />There, I discover a ok-good package, and very beautiful nugs. <br />Now, understand me. I don&#039;t give a f... about weed appearance. I want to smoke, not contemplate it. <br />But I did contemplate WhiteShark&#039;s weed. It was beautiful, smelled really nice and I loved to smoke it. I was a very, very happy customer. (Did i mention she threw a little extra ?)<br /><br />Second order : <br />Ok, so, second order was shipped exremly fast. Again, I think I did not wait for more than a week to get my weed. <br />There was no problem on the spelling of my name and first name.&nbsp; I had to go to the post office to get my package (which I give 0 fucks about), and there... there... packaging guys... the packaging that brings a SMILE on your face ! Really. <br />Once home, I see beautiful nugs, and nice smell. <br />i love to smoke it, but, as i wrote in my purchase review, the weed is very dry. Dry enough to make my lips very dry after 2 joints. <br />But, you know what ? I had been warned. Because this woman tells the truth. I knew it was dry weed. and it is still very very good. <br /><br />Summary : <br />This woman seems to work hard. She communicates well. She ships fast. I trust her. I FE twice and will do it again. <br /><br />To be quite honest whiteShark asked me if I could write a review. What I wrote is 100% what I think. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
