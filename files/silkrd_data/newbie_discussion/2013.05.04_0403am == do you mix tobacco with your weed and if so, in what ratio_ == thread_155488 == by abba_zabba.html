				I personally hate tobacco and either roll puries or hit a bong..<br />STILL tobacco has the positive of making the joint burn slower and in a more correct form.<br />So a 9/1* is an ok for me in case someone want to spliff.<br />*wee/tobacco ratio

				actually in the EU it is very common to mix baccy in with the weed to make it smoke better, especially because they smoke mostly hash. personally i don&#039;t mind a little bit, like a 6/1 to a 10/1 ratio weed/tobac. i prefer just smoking bowls of headdies though, now that i&#039;m here in the SWUSA i am spoiled a bit ;D

				I always smoke with a bit of tobacco. It&#039;s just not sustainable for most people to smoke pure blunts in the UK unless you grow your own, as 1g of weed costs so much. I did try smoking a blunt once when I ran out of tobacco and I way prefer the longer lasting burn of a nicely rolled joint.

				All the people posting about puries have my support but it&#039;s more of an economical issue rather than &quot;taste&quot; competition. <br />I think it&#039;s crystal clear to everyone that tobacco tastes like shit and is granulated dog food with shit on top (50/50 always).<br />Soooo...Long Live The Bong!

				I enjoy mixing a little tobacco to help it burn better. Love me a good spliff :3 Usually just eyeball it. Prolly ends up 4:1 or 3:1 weed:tobacco ratio. Can&#039;t smoke with my new job tho so it&#039;s just been &#039;cid and benzos for me!

				I rarely roll em anymore, but I got into the habit of adding a pinch when I was living in the UK. I&#039;m pretty particular about what tobacco I use though, if any. I won&#039;t use anything other than a whole leaf tobacco without additives like American Spirit. I don&#039;t recall where I read it, but I do remember reading that tobacco actually increases the vaporization of the thc and thus if you are smoking some dirt weed, it&#039;s actually better to roll up a mixed blunt. <br /><br />Nicotine can also help to counteract &quot;side effects&quot; such as munchies and cognitive issues as it has the opposite affect as THC does. While THC increases appetite, nicotine decreases it. While THC decrease cognitive activities, nicotine increases them.<br /><br />Nicotine also affects cannabinoid receptors in the brain (CB2 specifically) and can increase the pain reducing properties of those cannabinoids.

				I&#039;ve experienced the whole spectrum here...<br /><br />When I roll, I usually go clean, although my toke bloke revealed how by adding a pinch of good rolling tobacco (not cigarette chemical crap), you get a mellower comeup. Whenever we do that, we go about 1:4, although we smoke clean more often.<br /><br />Many of my other friends mix an entire cigarette with just a pinch of weed, making a horrible mix that I hate. I might puff a few out of courtesy, but that much tobacco feels much harsher on my throat.<br /><br />The best smoke I ever had though was from a massive blunt crammed with $200 of amazing herb... too bad nobody in my current area even knows what a blunt is.

				When I used to smoke the brown stuff I&#039;d sometimes use a small plug of rolling tobacco as a &quot;filter&quot; in my joints. Have never liked mixing it in with weed because the resulting smoke always tasted like soap!

				As I don&#039;t smoke regular tobacco I can&#039;t mix them. The taste of tobacco is unpleasant to me and I can&#039;t cope it without coughing. I haven&#039;t smoked weed for a great time now but when I do I&#039;m not going to mix them.<br />But couple of times I mixed my weed with dried peppermint from garden because I didn&#039;t had that much of a weed left for a joint. And actually peppermint smoothed my throat so it was pretty enjoyable and I like the taste too.

				Probably 60/40 or 70/30 tobacco. And pretty much the same for everyone I know here, smoking a pure roll would knock me clean out, then again I don&#039;t really smoke weed anymore.

				Well I do enjoy my spliffs and I mix them various rates depending on where and what I am doing and I am not a smoker.<br />Where I live in Europe the price of weed is not the issue - we grow the fucking bomb here and it is good to smoke in a bong or pipe also.<br /><br />but the beauty of the spliff is that we smoke them anywhere<br /><br />I regularly have a couple with me and enjoy that in restaurants or cafe&#039;s when we are out my wife , I and friends -&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Have got the stink eye a couple of times but generally it works like a charm<br /><br />another issue is that the weed I have tried in the US (several times) and in Amsterdam and in Christiania in Copenhagen is much weaker than the weed we have here - so mixing it <br />makes it burn nice and slow and you only need 20-30 % weed.<br /><br />
