				Hi,<br /><br />I know some states in Aus have quite strict quarantine laws. Is it safe to order small quantities (domestic only) to these states? <br /><br />I mean, there are some states that quarantine are introducing a fucking seed levy where they charge you a stupid amount of $$ if you buy seeds from another state. How would they enforce such a thing if they weren&#039;t checking all mail somehow? <br /><br />If you have any knowledge on the subject, I&#039;d love to hear from you.

				you gotta think about the sheer volume of mail that goes around australia everyday, they can&#039;t slow things dow with checks to much, i had seeds sent to the west from tassie no probs, same with international sure they gunna check more but at the end of the day the mail needs to arrive in a timely fashion whick means alot of stuff gets through the cracks

				Yeah I&#039;m not too worried about seeds though, it&#039;s drugs I&#039;m after. I don&#039;t like the idea of ordering something that&#039;s FAIRLY likely to get through. I always thought that Aus post was a sure fire delivery system until I remembered about select states&#039; strict quarantine.

				Domestic shipping is fine and safe provided the vendor isn&#039;t mentally retarded.

				It&#039;s going to get to you as long as they don&#039;t send it in a see through envelope that says this package containis illegal substances.
