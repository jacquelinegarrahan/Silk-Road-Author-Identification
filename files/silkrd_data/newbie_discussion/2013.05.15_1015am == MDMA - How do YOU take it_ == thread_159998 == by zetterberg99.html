				Hey everyone,&nbsp; stoked to be posting my first new thread!<br /><br />I wonder what everyones favorite method of taking MDMA is?&nbsp; My favorite to crush the crystals well and then mix it into a drink.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also taken capsules, blown it, and eaten straight moonrocks.&nbsp; My opinions on the four:<br /><br />Capsules (weighed to about 100mg) - Not too much for me and taking two is fine if they&#039;re spaced out enough.&nbsp; I find the come-up to be intense as i suspect this is from the capsule breaking and the chemical rushing your system.&nbsp; Often makes my girlfriend throw up.<br /><br />Nasal - OUCH.&nbsp; Tried with my first MDMA packages from the road.&nbsp; Learned my lesson.&nbsp; It hurts but 100mg will hit you like a wall in about 20 minutes.<br /><br />Nom nom nom - Terrible taste is a sign of great stuff&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; not fun to swallow but easiest when already in an &quot;altered state&quot;<br /><br />Drinking - My favorite intake method.&nbsp; I put 200-300 mg in a plastic waterbottle and shake the shit out of it.&nbsp; As long as you keep it separate from your fresh water this is great as you can sip as much as you want and have great control of your roll.&nbsp; No intense comeup as its spaced out over 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; Also makes it easy to share!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />Well, what do you guys think?&nbsp; Anyone have a strategy I haven&#039;t tried?&nbsp; I&#039;m always up for new experiments<br /><br />

				Snorting mdma=silly. lol<br /><br />Either parachute as mentioned, cap it.. orrr for novelty, i take a starburst, cut it in half, unwrap it, begin to much it between my fingers untill its all flat, and verry thin, pour the mdma in the center and fold it up real tight..<br /><br />&nbsp;the whole vomiting thing, is 100% normal, as thats your peak. <br /><br />the dosing is 1.5mg/kg of your body weight.

				300mg?!&nbsp; Hot damn android is going hard in the paint!&nbsp; I would never take that big of a dose myself, but if you don&#039;t mind my asking, is that due to your size or a tolerance?<br /><br />Most I&#039;ve witnessed taken at once was 400mg (my roommate).&nbsp; He came up in about 15 minutes and was totally incoherent until about the peak of his roll, then he just plateaued for a few hours.&nbsp; Pretty scary for the rest of us tho.&nbsp; Fortunately he was okay, but this 84% shit is no joke!<br /><br />I definitely would not suggest anyone blow a line of the stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never been a big fan of taking pressed pills.&nbsp; I&#039;d consider it off of SR though since I would trust the supply more than whats around here.&nbsp; Does anyone on SR sell pills mixed with MDMA and other stuff?&nbsp; I would think that would be of interest to alot of people if the contents were trustworthy.

				Hello , You can Take it Orally (bomb, capsule, pill, ect.) it hits second best, but is my favorite. (making a bomb with papers is better than a capsule, because the paper better dissolves ).&nbsp; If you crush a pill or take it non crushed is also a differnece, because a crushed one hits stronger, a non crushed lasts longer). You can also put the mdma in ur ass ! It hits more (strongest way to take, from the 3) but i prefer orally. And Last you could snort. ItÂ´s the fastes way to feelin the high, and it only hurts the first minute and the pain is not stronger than snorting amphetamine slurry ( i dont know the exactly word in english but i mean the paste-base from a failed meth sysnthesis.&nbsp; i think there are more ways , but that 3 a the populateds. Hope it helps. <br />P.L.U.R

				haha, digging the starburst idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bring on the novelty!<br /><br />does anyone know if it can be absorbed transdermally?&nbsp; when handling crystals to put into capsules I used to just use my fingers, which was easy, but I started to feel like my fingertips were tingling.&nbsp; probably just in my head.

				Snort a small like because I am utterly impatient. Scream gently whilst my eyes run like a tap. Open mouth and poor desired amount it, chew a bit, swallow. Wash mouth to avoid gum damage. <br /><br />Or if I just make a bomb with a rizzla

				Was tempted to answer &quot;as often as possible and in large quantities&quot; but seriously<br /><br />I must be the only one here so far who likes snorting MDMA! I love the hit and the burn isnt too bad (now 20mg of 2-CB in the nose that HURTS!!!!)<br /><br />I usually take about 140mg as a rizla bomb (thats 2mg/kg for me) and then bump lines of say 30mg as I fancy it.&nbsp; I guess im a bit tolerant too been doing MDMA/pills on and off for 20 years and i&#039;m a bit of a monster with MDMA.<br /><br />Did over half a gram with my gf a month or so back and it was all lines we racked them up and kept going every 10-15 mins till we were in orbit!&nbsp; :D <br /><br />Base loading with a bomb does lessen the nose injury tho.<br /><br />Never fancied shoving it up my ass!!<br /><br /><br />

				MDMA has Pharmacokinetics that are, pretty well understood now... there is a pretty simple reasoning towards how much to take and how much to save for extending the roll. They may not understand its effects, but it&#039;s methods of action are definitely getting more press now that PTSD sufferers have started to benefit from it like the rest of us.<br /><br />MDMA is my favorite non-herbal drug just ahead of LSD. I&#039;ve never really suffered the after effects from it... but that might have something to do with the depression I suffered a lot as a kid. Doctors threw all kinds of shit at me, none of it worked - MDMA made me a completely different person in society.<br /><br />That being said, to the original answer. Ultimately it depends on a few things - am I going to a Rave? Am I sitting at home? Did I do some the day before?<br /><br />If I&#039;m going to a party, I snort some on the way, but I&#039;ll usually bring some skittles with me because they&#039;re a bit easier in public, at least for me. I get just as much of a high from them while I&#039;m with other people in that sort of shared joy.<br /><br />If I&#039;m at home or at a party at home/at a house, snort. Definitely snort. This is my FAVORITE route of administration, I LOVE the taste of it. The drip is just awesome. Most people think I&#039;m crazy for it, but just like the way I feel on it... it&#039;s like candy from heaven.<br /><br />If I did some the day before (or recently enough that the load is gonna need to be higher), plug it. It took me a while to get used to doing it this way... but I was convinced that it was definitely a good way after the first time I tried it no less. I don&#039;t particularly like doing it this way... but it does give a great roll.

I mean yea when I crushed up a pill things would burn. Then I&#039;d get blue snot... which is funny in a napkin lol. But, powder? It&#039;s never burned all that much to me.

I&#039;ve been taking MDMA for 3 years now and when i do it i usually split 300mg-400mg between 2 capsules (as it doesn&#039;t usually fit in one) and if i just do one of the capsules (150mg-200mg) I don&#039;t have anywhere near as good time as when i do both. Like I say this could be a quality thing but i definitely do not think its a waste at all as re-dosing does not do the same as taking it all at once!

Bit short of breath / physically exhausted, but my pupils were dilated and my vision and thoughts were crystal clear for hours after.

				I usually put in a capsule. I usually take 80-100 mg, and then redose with another 80-100 mg when the first dose has kicked in.<br /><br />I don&#039;t snort it, since it is way to harsh on my nose. I also avoid licking it, since I find that it irritates my tongue and tends to cause canker sores. Same thing with pills. Sometimes I chew the pills so that they break down faster, but then I usually end up getting the tip of my tongue irritated for a few days thereafter.

				The hardest come up on MDMA I&#039;ve had as of yet, was a few moths ago at a party and one of the girls there had a lolly pop (chuba-chub type), and I dunno what possessed me but I took the lolly out of her mouth, properly dipped it into my bag of mandy, and just sucked/licked it all off the lolly. <br /><br />20 minutes later I was rushing like a mofo. haha. <br /><br />I actually don&#039;t mind dabbing it - tend to do that a lot of the time as is the most convenient when out and about raving... unless of course you plan ahead and make some bombs up before going out...

Ultimately, any drug that operates as an inducer, benefits from higher quantities. However, this is a logarithmic scale: there is an optimum point for efficiency, after which technically you are wasting it, as the benefit per mg drops dramatically. The reality is, there is no way to really specify the weight at which this point is reached, as purity as well as the method of the dosing contribute, as well as things inside your body as well as timing. <br /><br /><br />As for recent snorting support...<br /><br />I really do enjoy snorting it. The drip is amazing. &lt;3
