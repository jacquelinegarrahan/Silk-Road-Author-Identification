				in my opinion they are. To me 25i is in a class of its own and it took a few months of research for me to come to that conclusion. 25i has the impression of being a stimulant. It;s very speedy IMHO and trippy. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of info about it here in the forums I think in the drug safety page and evreywhere. 25c is more laid back with a relaxing nature. 25b has a lot of flashy trippiness about it<br /><br />hey airblaster1 how do the nbomes effect your tolerance for serotonin effecting drugs? They seem to really deplete my serotonin really fast and so the other drugs have to be put on the waiting list ya know? Like mdma. or lsd or shrooms and the other 2c family drugs.&nbsp; Now there are dozens of nbome vendors<br /><br />Nawlins has some of the best 25 i I ever had. Tyl3r&#039;s is always great but he is closed down for the time being<br /><br />LightFlower, http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e1a2aec8fe, has the best 25b I&#039;ve had

				I&#039;ve never taken NBOME before, but I have many friends who love the 25i and have told me its similar to mescaline.
