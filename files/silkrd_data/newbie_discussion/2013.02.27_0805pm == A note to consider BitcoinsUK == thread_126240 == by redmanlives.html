				Hey to anyone about to use BitcoinsUK I would be careful. I got half the bitcoins upfront but the second half he&#039;s delaying paying. He sent me 0.25 bitcoins when he should have sent 5.25. I&#039;ve given him until tomorrow 2pm then I&#039;ll report him. Just saying to anyone considering to send to him in near future be careful.

				I&#039;ve used him several times for much larger amounts and he&#039;s always come through. Did it not occur to you to message him asking about this, especially when it could&#039;ve been a typo that he&#039;d be ignorant to without you mentioning it?

				I&#039;ve only been reading good stuff about him... You should try speaking to him via PM or whatever before running your mouth on the forum, it&#039;s probably just a mix-up.&nbsp; :)

				OK first off yes I messed up, I was tired, sent him 0.25 instead of 5.25 but I rectified it later on and sent him a bit extra as an apology.<br /><br />I wish he had come back to this thread to say it had been sorted these kind of things can be very damaging! I&#039;ll make sure its the right guy and get him to come say I made it right :)

				Shit sorry thought I deleted this, the guy made genuine mistake, which I genually thought was him trying to rip me off. Got the coins and can&#039;t say a bad word about the guy. I wanted to warn the SR community just in case, in that had I been ripped off no one else could be ripped off in the time it took for me to resolve it.
