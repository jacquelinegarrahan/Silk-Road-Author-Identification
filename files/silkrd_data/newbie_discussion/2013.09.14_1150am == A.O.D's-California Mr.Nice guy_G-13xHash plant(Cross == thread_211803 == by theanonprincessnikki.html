(Though I appreciate those of you who do so voluntarily.)<br /><br />&gt; Your order will not be underweight. I don&#039;t trifle over fractions of a gram and don&#039;t expect my customers to either, so I always weigh orders over the advertised amount. How much it is over will vary, but you won&#039;t have to scrape shake out of the bottom to have the advertised amount - portions are generous and there is always enough to go round!<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ★★★★★Nikki&#039;s Review★★★★★&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reviewing Mr.Nice guy packaging was just about perfect honestly hun.
