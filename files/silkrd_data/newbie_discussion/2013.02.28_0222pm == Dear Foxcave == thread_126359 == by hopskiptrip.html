				Foxcave I hope you are back up and running soon. I purchased your mushroom powder. And am so glad I did. It was the best trip I have had in years. I got see the walls breathing the floors melting. Oh my precious lawn ever talk to me. I was putting it off cause I wanted to go through bat country with a friend but atlas I had to go solo. I was such a nice mellow trip Every time id start zoning watching crazy things I would pull myself back and laugh. I cant say enough how much I appreciate you wares. I have been up all night tripping and I feel so good right now. Mentally psychically and just all around better I feel lighter. Come back soon my new friend. Your art and work is needed.

				I got some mushroom powder recently from Foxcave. It was the best packaging I&#039;ve seen for mushrooms. What happened to Foxcave?

				Says on his page that he is taking a break. Probably has to regroup, the stress and all maybe. Or he could be waiting to re-up
