				Hi,<br />Ive got these digital scales at home they are small and compact which is good. The problem is they measure from 0.00g but Ive found they are very inaccurate below a gram. Anything over 500mg and into the grams they are good but if I want to measure 100mg or even 250mg they just are not sensitive enough to be reliable.<br />I dont want to spend a fortune and they are purely for personal use but I want something capable enough to measure out anywhere from at least 50mg and upwards and be reliable and quality.<br />Can anyone recommend some brands or sellers or what they use themselves that meet my requirements.<br />Thanks in advance.<br />

				My Weigh Palmscale 8 sets the standard, all others fall short IMHO.&nbsp; The 0.001g scales are $50 at Amazon. This is the best-selling digital scale in the world I&#039;m told. You&#039;d have to pry mine from my cold dead hands.

				TANITA - they are a bit expensive but any serious vendor or anyone with experience with products and such for sure has heard of them and probably uses them. Never let you down and very very accurate, had my mine for over two years and yet to see a problem. The smaller ones cost between 100-200 GBP, you pay for quality. Hope this helps, cheers

				The Palmscale has settings for pretty much any type of weight, even random stuff like troy weight. You can even customize it to add a specific weight if it doesn&#039;t have what you need.
