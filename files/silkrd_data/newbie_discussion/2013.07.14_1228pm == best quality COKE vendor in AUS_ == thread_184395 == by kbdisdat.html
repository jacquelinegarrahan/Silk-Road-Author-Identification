				Since your bumping it each day, I&#039;ll try and answer.<br /><br />Most people that have been around a while don&#039;t buy coke domestic.<br /><br />You REALLY are better off reviewing the feedback for the domestic coke listings than taking one or two peoples opinion in the forum to a question like this.<br /><br />In summary, for domestic coke, not many people who are buyers are active on the forums, and normal consensus is its overpriced given you can just uncheck the domestic box and get it twice the quality at half the price.<br /><br />I have bought domestic a couple of times and both times it was ok. I just went off feedback, and its too long ago to be any reliable sort of guide today.

				OzHigh has started selling coke at a very reasonable price ($300 a gram). I may be trying some this week or next. If I remember, I&#039;ll let you know how it goes.<br /><br />But yeah, domestic coke isn&#039;t usually that good, apparently.

				Thanks for the reply. <br /><br />Honestly, I would MUCH rather by overseas than domestic, everything on the SR market for aus is overprices and shit.<br /><br />Fucking customs though, straight up will seize my shit unfortunately. <br /><br />There&#039;s only really two coke vendors for aus, so I&#039;ll just pick up I guess. <br /><br />Was hoping someone had tried them though seeing as there isn&#039;t many options available for aussies, so lots of people would have HAD to try them.<br />

				I tested out a half gram of OzHigh&#039;s coke. It was pretty damn good man. Fucking awesome for the price.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re looking for the purist shit out there, I&#039;d choose dryice (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5e01abf2fd)<br /><br />He recently had his gear lab tested at 88%.

				I had assumed that there was no point in ordering coke domestically on the basis that it would be quicker and easier to simply set fire to my money. After many years I bought 2 grams at $400 each 3 years ago. Complete waste. Interesting to learn there may be some point in buying via SR
