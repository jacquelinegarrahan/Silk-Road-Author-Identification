				Some great things to do while tripping…can you add to this?<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Go for a walk or go hike in Nature…Especially if it is raining!!!!&nbsp; Staring at the moon can be an experience in itself.&nbsp; <br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though.&nbsp; <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Go to a Concert or Rave <br />5. Painting and Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on a psychedelic…the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; The paint does this disappearing, reappearing act and it is quite fun.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, foot massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metallic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You haven&#039;t seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!!&nbsp; Download the presets by googling: bltc winamp&nbsp; <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blueberries, Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good.&nbsp; <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paint-balling on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.&nbsp; <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other (black-light paint perhaps)<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt.&nbsp; <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)&nbsp; <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.&nbsp; <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers, legos or clay if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)&nbsp; <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining.&nbsp; <br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer <br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadget…)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid.&nbsp; <br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself, or Snap a picture here and there.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I can’t even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; &nbsp;Petting a cat or a furry animal. <br />45.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br />46.&nbsp; Close your eyes and think about how you are able to even think.&nbsp; Think about the fact that we are on a Rock flying through space, and that this Rock orbits a star.&nbsp; Think about Infinity and the universe and ask yourself: &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot;&nbsp; Let your mind wander and voice record your thoughts.&nbsp; Listen to them on another day.<br />47. stream of consciousness writing<br />48.&nbsp; Buy some Gallium online.&nbsp; Gallium is a metal with a melting point of about 85 degrees f. When you hold it in your hand for a minute or so it starts to liquify into what looks like Mercury. Gallium is not dangerous like Mercury however. You can easily buy some online for around $40. I think it would be a cool thing to play with while tripping.<br />49.&nbsp; Go to a reflexologist or have a masseuse (if you can handle interacting with people while tripping that is)&nbsp; if you don&#039;t know what reflexology is, google it and go do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s mind-blowing. <br />50.&nbsp; Go to a Diner at the end of the Experience and recharge your brain.&nbsp; Reminisce with your tripping partners on your experience (Go Through any pictures you may&#039;ve taken)<br />Any other suggestions?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				That&#039;s a great list, OP!&nbsp; Although as a snowboarder, I would have to say that skiing or snowboarding while tripping sounds incredibly dangerous to me... I would maybe do cross-country skiing or snowshoeing, but that&#039;s it.
