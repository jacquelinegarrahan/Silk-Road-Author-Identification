				My favorite drug combination that I&#039;ve had a chance to dance with would have to be oxycodone mixed with a little alcohol. I know you aren&#039;t suppose to mix the two together, but dam it transports you to a state of pure bliss. I haven&#039;t did opiates for about 3 months as I&#039;m trying to <br /><br />wane myself off of them, but I enjoyed that combination.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard so many positive things about candy-flipping and hippie-flipping, but I have yet to try MDMA + LSD or MDMA + Mushrooms. I will as soon as I get enough coin together though. Enough about my experiences though, what are you guy&#039;s favorite drug combinations????&nbsp; :)<br />

				ive candy/hippy/kitty/jedi/wtfever-flipped quite a few times and have to say, i&#039;ve seen quite a few ppl who dropped that shit at festivals or something&nbsp; seriously freak out, and i always feel pretty close to exploding on the come-up.&nbsp; i like LSD + MDMA more than any of the other ones (mushrooms make my sinuses feel weird), but i wouldn&#039;t do it again now even though i dont regret doing it then.&nbsp; really what keeps me from recommending candy-flipping tho is that acid lasts a lotttt longer than md, and its really difficult to dose at the right time to keep yourself from having a seriously horrifying comedown.<br /><br />but all in all id have to say my favorite combo really is dabs and tussionex (lil bit of Boy instead works in a pinch too).&nbsp; i don&#039;t really like plunging myself into a deep psychedelic trance that much anymore (i think terrence mckenna is the one who said, &quot;once you get the message it&#039;s time to hang up the phone&quot;), and prefer drugs to relax and medicate me, not tear my ego out particle by particle..&nbsp; just my thing

				Definitely depends on the situation and the company. <br /><br />Relaxation or solo= weed or opiates<br />Clubbing= coke and alcohol or mcat<br />Small group in private setting= LSD and weed<br /><br />Overall though weed is my go-to choice in every situation.

				Never tried coke but I love me some scotch, and yea mushrooms and weed gel together pretty nicely. Makes me feel really introspective and spiritual; very nice buzz I must say.<br /><br />I had the chance to grab some of Cloudsurfers legendary MDMA, and now I&#039;m waiting on my Tesselated tabs to arrive so I can finally flip out. Cloudsurfers MDMA made me explode from the inside on the come up, I can only imagine how that cookie crumbles when I get my Tess tabs in&nbsp; :).

				Good ol&#039; alcohol and Heroin works wonders for me. Or alcohol and coke. Or alcohol and weed. Or alcohol.<br /><br />Haha, but really. I find mixing alcohol with just about anything to be enjoyable. The other night I had a wonderful time drinking, doing H, smoking weed, and had taken 100mgs of DPH a few hours beforehand. Shows it really is all about moderation.

				I haven&#039;t had too much experience with combos. When I have, I&#039;ve had some pleasant experiences and some not so pleasant experiences. <br /><br />Smoking weed at the end of MDMA and especially the next day has always been very pleasant for me. I guess maybe that&#039;s my favorite at the moment.

				i remember 8 years ago, i was fully drunk and consumed 30mg of ritalin. the rush was so unique and euphoria strong and amazing. never got that rush again after a injury. It was fucking amazing, just as good as coke and alcohol if not better. the ethylphenidate currently on sale would not match the above. idea is to get drunk first then pop the pills. the metabolism of it this way does the job.

				Shrooms aint shit without pot and opiates without booze.<br /><br />Also i think one dark night in high school I smoked a little pot, drank, had some xanax, percocet and something else I don&#039;t even remember. If felt very unique. Not sure if it stands out as good, though. Just different. I felt god-like and good.

				After a night of partying and balling with some rich friends who don&#039;t know what to do with their families and tables full constantly through the night, there&#039;s nothing like going to the gentleman&#039;s doing a few gummies of some top uncut shit, (saves the obvious leaking nose the next day), go to their huge homes with a bunch of girls from club and smoke some dank! After a potential nice night with a nice lady best part is you wake up next day feeling fresh after going to sleep like a baby, thats my remedy of a good ass weekend!

With a nice opiate buzz I feel on top of the world AND I can functional on a very intelligent level.

My advice to anyone who hasn&#039;t IV&#039;d a drug (Heroin specifically) DON&#039;T DO IT, yes it&#039;s one of the greatest feelings in the world, but it WILL ruin your life, especially if you can afford it and can find it on a daily basis

				One day in the not too distant past, I stumbled across a beautiful mixed Kitten by the name of Molly. She was a tabby with jagged interruptions of white fur, with sharp angles akin to crushed ice. Anytime she graced my presence, I was overtaken by a strong feeling of neverending contentful bliss. Since that day, no other combination of feelings had given me the feeling that Molly the Kitty gave me.&nbsp;
