				I placed a $80 order last week for 1 gram of molly. Which I was planning on taking for the first time with some friends on vacation today. The seller is newer (became vendor like 3 months ago) but has a good amount of good reviews.<br /><br />anyways i messaged him the other day and asked for a tracking number. He gave it to me and it says I received it Saturday. He sent via usps and the tracking number says delivered Saturday to my city, state. But it doesnt say my exact address. also i was home all day saturday. so im thinking a couple of things... <br /><br />1. He could of sent nothing to a random address in my city.<br />2. My package was confiscated, but it says delivered?<br />3. Mailman dropped it off to the wrong house..<br /><br />What would you guys do? Should i call my local postal service or is that too risky? should i dispute this transaction? I dont know what to do.. I am going to ask some neighbors if they received any of my mail though.

				sounds like it got delivered to the wrong house maybe.<br />His stats look pretty good, almost 300 sales in 2 months, plus the fact he didn&#039;t make you F.E.<br /><br />

				I just messaged him asking if he can prove he sent it to my actual address and not just my city. Would like to try and work it out between us before automatically disputing it. I even just went through all my garbage this week (yeah nasty as hell) just to make sure I didn&#039;t accidentally throw it out but but no luck... I&#039;ll keep you guys updated on what happens or at least try... I&#039;m leaving on vacation in a few hours.

Things can get very messy when resolutions are attempted person-to-person; at least in the resolution center you can both be sure that things will be kept civil, and as factual as possible.<br /><br />Libertas

				i have had packages say delivered and then show up a few days later in the past.&nbsp; but since saturday seems to be a long time.&nbsp; <br />also if you live in a place where you share a large bank of mailboxes (apt, etc. where the mailman needs a key to open the boxes) it is possible the box is broken, even if you can open your individual mailbox.&nbsp; ive had this happen in the past too so it said delivered but the mail carrier had to try to redeliver it for days until the box was fixed.

				But if the vendor has given the tracking is he still held responsible (i am not saying you should have to lose your 80 also) but reason why I say this is cos tracking, goes country, state, county, and city and possibly town, so you can almost track your mail to your city. None the less, I hope your get mail pal.<br /><br />Cheers
