				I&#039;ve tripped alot lately on acid,nbomes through the summer. I&#039;ve noticed that even after three weeks of no psyches, smoking marijuana brings back the trip. But today has been by far the craziest trip ever. I smoked some kush and was listening to music. All of a sudden this amazing body high came over me. I looked around and was blown away- the most intense visuals I&#039;ve ever had,even on acid. It was like the best acid I&#039;ve ever had. Just from weed. <br />The walls of my room were literally swimming like milky surface with many colors, shapes formed everywhere and morphed in these geometric patterns that were very 3d ,clearly popping out into my close field of vision. When I closed my eyes these very complex fractals would dance before me with dazzling overlays of color, orbs floating in then exploding into pieces,each forming a new design. These images would persist upon opening my eyes and would crawl all over the furniture and snake up the walls like flowers in bloom.The air looked liquid like,rippling and bubbly. This same liquid was surrounding my hand and when I waved it in front of me the aura around my hand&nbsp; would vibrate and make very clear indentations in the liquid air. <br />Trails&nbsp; on everything moving. My arms are now covered in this moving energy made of some language,arcane symbols. This is the most amazing trip I&#039;ve ever had, on ANY psyche! This weed is awesome! Kush...as I&#039;m typing this the letters on my screen are like &#039;dancing&#039; abit...wtf. I don&#039;t know what to say about this. Have any of you experienced something this intense from just smoking weed? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I may not have to take acid again. Maybe the acid unlocked some door... and it never closed.<br />Cheers :)<br />

				Whoa that sounds intense. Whenever I smoke after a trip it can bring back very faint visuals but nothing like you describe. I have a pretty high tolerance for weed though.

				This sounds unreal lol. Not that I don&#039;t believe you, but it sounds very uncommon! Would love to score some of that weed! I simply cannot put my mind around hitting up a joint and starting to trip balls lol. Hope you had a blast.

				I had a friend in high school who would describe the blue cube in the woods that he would enter and metaphysical secrets would be revealed to him.<br /><br />My own visuals were more like doing salvia. :(

				I had visuals like 20mg of 2C-E from 6 hits of cannabis many many years ago.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t smoked in over a year and I ended up with a little nug.&nbsp; I packed a small bowl and took 6 hits and zoned out due to all of the colors and designs spinning and getting bigger and smaller all over the place.&nbsp; The visuals only lasted about 15 minutes and I passed out after that.
