				Hi guys<br /><br />I know it&#039;s best not to name the vendor so I won&#039;t, but basically I bought a small package off someone and it didn&#039;t turn up. It was marked in transit after about a week (I messaged him after only a few days and he said it wouldn&#039;t be long). Now I had to message him again because the thing was about to auto-finalize, so I applied for an extension. The dude didn&#039;t reply, and his seller rating has dropped from the high 90&#039;s to 80%. Also I can&#039;t view his vendor page for some reason, even if I type the URL with /user/idnumber it just goes straight to send him a message, but I want to view his profile.<br /><br />What is going on here, and if he doesn&#039;t reply or the item doesn&#039;t show up will I be entitled to a full or partial refund?

				Sounds like you got scammed, hopefully you didn&#039;t drop a lot of BTC for that package.

				Yep, he was definitely a scammer, as (unfortunately) it takes A LOT for SR to suspend/revoke a vendor&#039;s privileges... Who was it?<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter now, as you&#039;re definitely not getting your package... Trust me, a vendor named xanaxbar (at the time had 100% feedback and nothing but great reviews, like many who do this) took me for $100 before he dipped out...&nbsp; Fucking scammers ruin this great place!!!

				The vendor was called CashMachine<br /><br />The package was 1g of coke for about £50 I think, can&#039;t remember exactly<br /><br />We&#039;re still in escrow, so if it is a scammer I should get my BTC back right?

Likely for scamming. If you Finalized Early, you&#039;re in trouble, otherwise you have to take it into resolve, and/or contact SR Staff for a refund(if you stayed in Escrow, as advised in the SR Wiki).<br /><br />Sucks bro... I hate scammers!
