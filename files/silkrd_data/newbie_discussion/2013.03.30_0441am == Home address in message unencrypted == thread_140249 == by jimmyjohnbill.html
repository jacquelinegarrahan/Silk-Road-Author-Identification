				I&#039;m dealing with a vendor that looks like they&#039;re having issues with their PGP.&nbsp; I originally sent my address encrypted, but it&#039;s looking like he was unable to decrypt it.&nbsp; Now I might have to send my mailing address in a message.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know when you enter your address when ordering it will be deleted, so even unencrypted it has some security.&nbsp; But with messages this isn&#039;t a guarantee, he might leave my private information floating around on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m just checking, but it seems like it would be a horrible idea to send it unencrypted.&nbsp; Am I correct here?&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll use privnote for the guarantee it will be deleted after being read.&nbsp; Thanks guys.

				Fuuuuck that is a red flag. I would re encrypt, send my key and then the encrypted address in a message. I only ever once didn&#039;t use PGP,I was high as fuck when I did it though.<br /><br />

				Yeah that&#039;s what I thought.&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna talk to him and see if he can get a new public key, or figure out whatever he fucked up.&nbsp; If he can&#039;t figure out PGP I think a privnote would be secure enough.

				If a vendor can&#039;t or is unwilling to figure out PGP you should probably move on and find someone else.

				I should have mentioned this is mostly speculation.&nbsp; <br /><br />I read in one of the other forums about the vendor sending out a mass pm that he was having issues, I didn&#039;t receive it so I don&#039;t know what happened there.&nbsp; Something with his computer, or working on a better shipping method.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today I noticed his PGP isn&#039;t listed on his page anymore.&nbsp; So it looks like something must have happened with that.&nbsp; Lastly he said all orders would&nbsp; always&nbsp; ship within 48 hours, but 48 hours just ticked by.&nbsp; I&#039;m in contact with him, waiting for a response from him.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll figure something out.&nbsp; I was just looking for some&nbsp; reassurance that it would be a dumb idea to send my mailing address through a pm, if it even came to that.&nbsp; Thanks guys.

				no pgp no order. just the way it should be. pgp should be a requirement for vendors if it is not already.

				Exactamundo. Made the mistake of doing that the first go around (hadn&#039;t figure out pgp yet). Never again. Even privnote makes me nervous.
