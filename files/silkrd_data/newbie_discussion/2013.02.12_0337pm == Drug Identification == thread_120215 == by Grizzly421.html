				About&nbsp; 2 years ago in the midwest US there was a drug that was called bliss. It was before all the &quot;plant food&quot; and &quot;bath salts&quot; where sold in stores. It was white fluffy powder. it clumped together and almost seemed moist. It was the strongest, most euphoric stuff I have ever done.&nbsp; almost immediately after snorting a 10mg line it would produce a &quot;wooosh&quot; feeling and I would need to shit. anybody know what it would have been?

				There is no way to know for sure but the three most common chem where mdpv, m1, and drone.&nbsp; I vend the most high quality domestic supply of two of the three and can point you in the direction of the only vedor who&#039;s drone I&#039;d buy.&nbsp; Heck I&#039;d be happy to make you a very cheap private listing for the two I carry so you can sample them and see if one of them was it.&nbsp; I would basically do it for postage fees..

				I&#039;ve done all three of those, mephedrone is the most similar but looks completely different. It looked most like mdpv but didn&#039;t last hours it was more of a big rush and over after about an hour. <br /><br />I actually have gotten you m1. Good stuff, I&#039;ll probably get some more but right now I&#039;m waiting on some mephedrone.

				vuw62nhym6nbhkyz&nbsp; &nbsp; hit me up on torchat if you want to find out if the drone is garbage or not. IMHO there is only one good source for it right now.
