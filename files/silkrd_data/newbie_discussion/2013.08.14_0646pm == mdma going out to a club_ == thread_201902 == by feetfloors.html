				Hi, i wounder if it would be a good idea to go out partying on mdma, and if so how much i should take.<br /><br />The first day i took like the 0.1mg mdma, then the second day 0.2 mdma and now the last day i wonder on how much(yes i know that you should not take mdma so often, but i want to do it before my school starts)<br />So i have 0.3 mg left, then time i took 0.2 mg i did hallucinate some, like i saw &quot;shadow people&quot; and i saw some stuff that wasn&#039;t there in reality, i also said stuff randomly like if i was talking to someone, even tho they weren&#039;t there(tho this only happened like 3-4 times in 3 hours or so), so if i go out partying should i take 0.1 first, then after a hour or so if i want more take another hit? or go smaller with like 0.05 mg?<br /><br />I Have only take mdma 4 times, one time before this so i have not much experience with it.<br />Also do you think i should mix mdma with alcohol? i have heard that it makes the tops of the mdma worse?(Like not as strong as without alcohol)<br /><br />Thanks in advance :)

				ive taken mdma a few times and i have never hallucinated off it, thats kinda strange to me. usually the product thats being sold on SR has a high potency level close to 60-90% pure mdma. so if i were you id think twice about doing to much. id suggest you do the right amount by your body weight so if you weigh around 155 your intake should be 105mg and re dose 52mg after an hour an half. that should last you for a few hours and if the party is still going then maybe parachute another 50mg to stay rolling. dont over do it. always take hard drugs in moderation for your safety, never drink booze with it and hydrate with plenty of water not to much tho, id say 8oz for every hour. have fun and be safe.

				All I can say is stick to a safe, comfortable dose and make sure you drink plenty of water. Hydration is key when it comes to rolling. If you become dehydrated, not only are you putting yourself in danger, but it lessens the effects of your roll. Dehydration makes things not as pleasant as far as effects go and can make the comedown/hangover much worse. So just make sure you are safe and you&#039;ll have a great time. And if you&#039;re doing it this much that frequently, I would advise taking a break for a good while. At least a few months, you don&#039;t want to lose the &quot;magic&quot;.

				Of course it&#039;s a good idea to go out partying on MDMA! It&#039;s a party drug. :) But I would take a bit less than I would if I stayed in a private place with friends.

				Be prepared for a wild ride.<br /><br />If it were me.... I&#039;d leave the phone in the car and just bring in your ID and a small amount of cash.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Depending on the quality the dose will be different.&nbsp; You can find this information online all over the place.... it&#039;s hard to say about dosage, but really, it doesn&#039;t take that much.&nbsp; Be careful.<br /><br />Drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol.

				Were those dosage rates above in mg to pounds? I have read elsewhere in the forum 1.5mg to the kilo. I am 90 kilos and plan to hit the club on Friday night with my first bit of mdma in years. (I had done a few pills but not for at lest seven years)<br /><br />

				Na dont drink alcohol on md man :/ You probably wont feel a thing until you start coming down then it&#039;ll hit you like a ton a shit. As for the first question it is most definately a good idea to go out clubbing etc on mdma. I have wasted many rolls sat in front of speakers at friends houses and regretted not saving it for a better occasion. Lastly, dont go to mad on the repeat taking man, space rolls out as much as you can and the experience is something to look forward too. The &quot;magic&quot; doesn&#039;t last forever, you know? ;)<br /><br />ps Pure orange juice its the dogs bollocks when buzzin&#039; :D

				MDMA is the perfect party drug. Just make sure you drink a good amount of water.

				Thanks man!<br />I can&#039;t take credit for it though.<br />I&#039;m pretty sure I stole it from zvp1014.<br />or moonflower.<br /><br />Either way, Helen Keller is said to be the original creator of that quote!<br /><br />Might even do a little research on the topic, myself.
