				I wouldn&#039;t encourage spamming the vendor.&nbsp; Did you not stay in escrow?&nbsp; If you stayed in escrow, SR would be able to help you get your money back.&nbsp; But it sounds like you finalized early against all of our warnings to STAY IN ESCROW.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />You can report the vendor as a scammer by using the &quot;report this vendor&quot; link on their vendor profile, but in the end, I&#039;m sorry, but you made the decision to finalize early knowing that many people are scammed that way.

				I put advice up for bulk buyers here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=152078.msg1053693#msg1053693<br /><br />I lost $14,000 in one shot on here from not following the escrow rules. Don&#039;t get crazy or act unprofessional. There&#039;s no point. People will just avoid you and ignore what you are saying. It&#039;s fucked up, but that&#039;s how it is right now. Never FE.

				Ya, if they wanted posters to have different levels it should have ordered by buyer/seller stats or something, not by how much you spam
