				Why is it that the prices for domestic weed in Australia so shit?<br /><br />And why do so many people buy such tiny amounts (1G) for such high prices?<br /><br />Am I missing something?&nbsp; Is the quality THAT much better than normal weed?<br /><br />Why can&#039;t someone (who&#039;s not a scammer) sell fucking ounces for $300?&nbsp; Every cunt in the country would be ordering them!&nbsp; I know the shit comes cheap in bulk, especially since it can come straight from the producers, so why isn&#039;t someone doing this?&nbsp; Makes me think I should start a grow-op.

				Hey long-time SR user, first time forum poster. I came here looking for answers to that exact same question. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been using the SR for around 18 months now and 95% of the time always buy domestic - it&#039;s safer, quicker etc etc. But in the last few months the prices have gotten beyond ridiculous. Especially for weed.<br /><br />Luckily I have a regular, reliable supplier of high-quality weed in the real world and she lives a few blocks away. She charges $80 for a quarter of dank sativa. She travels quite a bit though and there&#039;s times she isn&#039;t around, during these times I buy a bit of weed on the SR to get me through.<br /><br />I just logged into SR to see what&#039;s up. I won&#039;t name names, but there is one Aus seller on there selling 7g of sativa for 1.01 bc + .09 postage = 1.10. <br /><br />Based on the current exchange rate from my bc provider ($128 AUD), that equates to around $140. For a fucking quarter.<br /><br />ALMOST A 200% FUCKING MARK UP!<br /><br />And all the reviews are glowing. Are people fucking mental or have I missed something? Do people even realise they are paying double?! $140 is the price for half an ounce, but if you order on the SR you&#039;re only getting a quarter. It&#039;s robbery.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know who&#039;s worse, the sellers setting their prices so high, or the douchebags paying them. I can only assume it&#039;s kids who don&#039;t know street prices. No self-respecting weed smoker would pay $140 for a quarter and most dedicated weed smokers have their own supply in the real world anyway. <br /><br />What sucks the most is that it has had a knock-on effect to other drugs and now EVERYTHING in Australia is above street prices. But hey, I&#039;m still not keen to risk international so waddya do?

				I find it interesting that weed prices have hardly risen in Oz since the early 80&#039;s!!!&nbsp; We too score &#039;off the street&#039; IRL as the prices here are excessive, but that said...<br /><br />You guys are also forgetting that this is an International site, and that in many places in the world pot is RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE!! e.g. UAE aka United Arab Emigrates...we&#039;ve hears the price for ONE GRAM is around $180-200USD!!! IIRC it&#039;s ~$80 in Japan!<br /><br />Who&#039;s to say the vendors dont have such customers...and it&#039;s noy like Oz is a &quot;watched&quot; country, esp for EXporting drugs .... It&#039;s NOT on &#039;watch lists&#039; in most countries, but who&#039;s to say a whole bunch of stuff isn&#039;t going from here to places like there? ***<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Now we have no idea how much of their pot goes OS, but, remember Schappelle?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; We have it on fairly good authority that what she (did NOT know) she was carrying, was 4kgs of Primo pot for expats who (so I&#039;m told..&quot;gladly pay $800-1000 fpr top quality weed from a safe source&quot;)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; I believe they believe the &quot;safest&quot; source, for them, is another Aussie!&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; <br />They would rather pay top dollar for security, rather than chance a few hundred bucks on 10+years jail....cant say we blame em either!<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />Caveat Emptor RULES the Road, and now as us &#039;buyers&#039; start to build a forum with some cohesive standards, where members CAN come to get an idea of &#039;who&#039;s doing what&#039;&nbsp; AND&nbsp; be able to have a fair level of confidence in the other members sincerity<br />&nbsp;<br />I guess these prices reflect this<br />&nbsp;and they&#039;re<br />&nbsp;makin much moola!<br />&nbsp;motek ;)

				Hey motek.<br /><br />Good point about the relative cheapness of Aussie weed and the export factor. But the majority of Aus seller accounts say they only ship domestic, so they&#039;re not selling it to OS buyers. Maybe people buy domestic and then export but I hardly think anyone&#039;s going to buy a Q to export. And even the listings for 1g average about $40-$50, when street price is around $20-$25.<br /><br />For me personally, the effect of this is that I&#039;ve pretty much given up on SR. Today was the first time I&#039;d even logged in in over a month only to find that prices have gotten even higher, not just for weed but for everything. I like to dabble in MDMA and LSD now and then but those prices are now way above street prices to, so I pretty much don&#039;t bother. I stopped buying international when I had a package seized by customs a while back. I got a letter in the mail saying it had been seized and no more came of it so I was fine, but it was enough to scare me off importing forever. I would love to take advantage of OS prices but I refuse to take the risk of the cops knocking on my door one day.<br /><br />Anyway, like most people who complain on internet forums, I have no solutions, just having a whinge.<br /><br />But in saying that, if any Aus vendors see this I would appreciate an explanation as to why you put such a huge mark up on your product. I don&#039;t blame you, there&#039;s money to be made and your making it. Kudos to you, but just wondering, do you only set the price that high because you know people will pay it? I can&#039;t imagine the risk being any greater than the risk real-world dealers take, if anything it&#039;s less risk because you don&#039;t have a parade of stoners turning up at your door day in day out.

				Are the prices for other drugs in Australia bad on SR too ? I saw that domestic MDMA is expensive there.

				Pretty much, but not as bad as weed seems to be. Which seems really odd to me. In my experience weed is easy to come by in Aus and I&#039;ve never really struggled to get it. Besides you can grow the shit yourself pretty easily. <br /><br />Checked a few listings just then. I&#039;m not that wise on OS prices so someone else will have to tell me if these sound reasonable...bear in mind that this is in AUD which these days is pretty much on par with US.<br /><br />A gram of coke is going for $455 with one seller, $360 with another.<br />A gram of meth = $628<br />A gram of heroin (yuk) = $374<br />Can&#039;t find an MDMA listing for a gram of powder, but pills are around $35 each, which is actually quite good. I&#039;ve paid $40+ for a pill off-SR before.<br />10 LSD tabs = $190 (again not too bad)<br /><br />I even saw a listing for 3g of dried cubensis mushies (really only one dose, and a pretty low one) going for $80, which made me laugh, especially since I was walking to the shops the other day and came across a little patch of cubensis just growing like crazy on someone&#039;s nature strip. Picked me about 30g of fresh cubensis&nbsp; ;D The weather conditions in OZ are just prime for shrooms at the moment so get out there and keep your eyes to the ground. Free drugs! Free enlightenment!

				I&#039;d check out this guy &#039;Supplyin Aus&#039;, been following the bud listings on SR for 2 years and there&#039;s probably not too many local vendors I haven&#039;t sampled... http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/eefd778bc7<br /><br />Seems to switch it up between indoor and outdoor batches but both have been amazing, this latest indoor is some of the best bud I&#039;ve bought on the road and is still going for standard prices ($50\3.5g) + fees. I&#039;ve tried out plenty of the named strains around but honestly a lot of them really aren&#039;t worth the money people are charging.

				I can get on locally off someone for ounces 250, but a lot cheaper in bulk. The reason they are such high prices is because silk road has a surcharge on every purchase. <br /><br />There is a seller, QualityAUSurance, who was selling quality bud at a good price, just under 300 a bag. He should be back in stock soon.

				Dingo Ate My Drugs has some reasonably priced bush bud at $100 a quarter, which is par for the course ...<br /><br />@alchemetric yeah those prices are about right, but they can vary 10-20% ... a g of good molly (domestic) is around $200-240 which seems to be the standard<br /><br />g&#039;s of great coke &#039;could fetch up to $600! :o<br /><br />back to the possibility of domestic vendors shipping OS, we have a US vendor who states in their profile they Only ship to the US ... that&#039;s Not so! They&#039;re happy to ship down here but I have no idea why they say they dont!&nbsp; Go figure?<br /><br />maybe it&#039;s so people do as we did and pm them first to discuss the &#039;possibilities&quot; ... idk!<br /><br />&#039;<br /><br />

				Agree with SmashBros, have to factor in SR surcharge also there would be heaps of customers who don&#039;t have access to a supplier, live in remote areas or prefer the anonymity of purchasing online

				I noticed the weed prices jumped sharply after XMAS.<br /><br />There was a drought on the road for domestic weed which didnt help.<br /><br />Personally I dont mind paying a bit more of SR for quality weed, and where I live at present I dont have any connects.<br /><br />I rationalise it by thinking what the street price is +SR commission fees +vendors loose a bit when cashing out of BTC plus packaging and labor costs. It&#039;s a business and they are here to make money.<br /><br />I tend to stick to my own trusted vendors and also factor in stealth and professionalism. Food vac sealong some weed and throwing it in an envelope is not stealth and I have received some shitty packages before. Also receiving weed so compressed and flattened like roadkill sucks too.<br /><br />I have had some great scores, Boyd Crowders hash was quality and well priced. Cannamo&#039;s AK47 was nice, Rastaman&#039;s Jack Herrer awesome.<br /><br />Bought some pretty ordinary over-priced weed from Half Baked. MedicalandMedicinals Shishkaberry overhyped bush weed with lots of timber in it but hey it was cheap.<br /><br />My go to vendor these days is PuffinBilly he has some good strains, good stealth.

Currently waiting to sample the Amnesia Haze and White Widow.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey guys!<br /><br />How are we all?<br /><br />Completely understand why some of you guys would feel this way cause in comparison to some street prices in certain parts&nbsp; of Aus, from the outset Aus SR weed looks expensive BUT what you need to understand is a few things.<br /><br />1) SR takes a commission on each sale as mentioned in prev post.<br />2) Some buyers not a huge amount&nbsp; forget to Finilise and you can wait up to 17 days for your money, so you have to factor this in.<br />3) Expenses such as postal materials may seem to the non vendor &quot;not that expensive&quot; but think about how many orders are sent a week by a average vendor and try and work out how much it would cost in materials? If you have received a order from me then you will know what I use, I can tell you that its NOT cheap ESPECIALLY when stealth is a MAX priority like mine.<br />4)Packaging is not a quick process either and doing it under the rador along with dispatching the orders takes a lot of meticulous planning and (well for me) additional expenses. Obviously I can not disclose the info but yeah there a way more expenses that you have to take into account, that&#039;s IF the Vendor is doing the right thing and has security measures in place.&nbsp; I mean you can skimp out on things BUT you leave yourself open to exposure quite easily.<br />5) Changing BTC to usable, untraceable CASH is (if you are doing things properly that is) a additional expense and can vary on what level you have in place... think about it for a sec.. how would you convert this money quickly without being traced and convert into cash?&nbsp; My connections for bulk supplys unfortunately don&#039;t take BTCS as payment..lol I wish!<br />6) Quality of the product.<br />7) Supply..... for me around chrissytime, there was a mad drought and I was paying 25 - 50% more just to keep up stock levels to supply my customers, therefor I had to increase my price BUT since then things have started to level out and I have lowered my price accordingly.<br />8) SR&#039;s whole concept is to provide a portal for people to get great quality products without the headache of a street dealer and basically the safety aspect etc and for me when I was a buyer I was happy to pay extra for the comfort of being able to Vet a vendor first, read reviews/feedback and then order from the comfort of my own home.<br /><br />I&#039;m not speaking for all Vendors here and feel free to add more to this&nbsp; post.<br /><br />Cheers! and I hope that puts things into perspective for you guys. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Totally agree and half baked has an amazing service,<br /><br />Also people expect price to be around what they get usually (locally or not), it is dry and not always easy to get on so people do pay a little more themselves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks Mate!

				I gotta say halfbaked I hope the quality of your bud has improved, I&#039;ve bought off you several times at your originally low prices and then once your pricing was inflated.. and the second batch I got was somehow&nbsp; worse than the first. Nothing personal, I just found I needed to smoke a hell of a lot to get stoned.

				I&#039;m currently getting $280 oz of some decent quality bush, looking to stop buying from him and start supporting the vendors of the road, also curtailing my usage to max once a week so the higher price here won&#039;t be that much of an issue, just want some high quality buds.

				Like many, I have plenty of contacts for local weed and must say, the idea of sending through the mail without appropriate stealth somewhat risky but, the possibility of getting some good imported hash is definitely worth a thought.

				the prices aren&#039;t so bad. afterall, I&#039;ve been getting 1g for $25 off open houses in my area. <br />and I&#039;ve even bought 2 ounces of MALE BUSH PLANTS for $800 ( i wanted to burn the dealers house down - but i well and truly believe in karma) after losing that much money and losing $25 bucks to some jackass on ebay for 5htp i&#039;m a little bit hesistant (but still VERY TEMPTED) to buy off SR.<br /><br />to answer the question - &quot;why does it suck on SR?&quot;, because:<br />1) any weed is better than no weed<br />2) if you can get better locally - why are you asking this question? i&#039;d LOVE to buy local. it&#039;s like buying at your local vege market as opposed to shopping at Coles Online.<br /><br />god is fair and good when you breathe in and pay attention to the details of your circumstances. the details to my current circumstances on SR are pretty awesome and prettttttttyyyy..and I feel the spirit of libertarianism burning bright and strong.<br /><br />
