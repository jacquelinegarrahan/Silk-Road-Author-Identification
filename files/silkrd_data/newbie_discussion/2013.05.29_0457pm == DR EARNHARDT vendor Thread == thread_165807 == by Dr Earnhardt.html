				UPDATE: My sample (1g &#039;Snow White&#039;) just arrived, perfect stealth and smells amazing. His vendor page looked a bit weird at first but he delivered with stealth and his prices seem very reasonable. The product is very good, so I would recommend trying it out.

				The reason why you can read back in my profile that some lambo (SAMPLES) didn&#039;t arrive is that most of the time people that receive their sample just don&#039;t give feedback, and those who received none DO!!!<br /><br />Nevertheless I managed to smuggle some big orders of Lambo&#039;s (100+) into Australia, stealthy shipping has been great success so far and also cactuses which aren&#039;t vacuum sealed, also arrived.<br /><br />Another reason is the large amount of 1 gram/1 lambo/sample hunters.

				I ordered two pills off Dr Earnhardt that never arrived and he gave me a refund that was about $10 USD more than what I paid for in escrow. I don&#039;t think he is scamming people I just think he is shipping from a high profile country and might need to look at his shipping practices.

				Hello,<br /><br />New articles are being added almost every week.<br />If you/anyone has suggestions they are welcome and I&#039;ll look at the possibilities.<br /><br />P.s.

I&#039;m planning on stopping the shipment of samples since they look to suspicious to custom agents.<br /><br />Dr. Earnhardt<br />

				Anyone try his fresh peyote?&nbsp; According to the link Dr. Earnhardt posted in the peyote listing, you need a lot more, like 3-5 times more than one of his listings to have a decent trip.&nbsp; I was wondering if anyone can say how their trip was because there is another vendor selling dry peyote, but his prices are also ridiculously high.

				I feel I have to warn my fellow Scandinavian customers. <br />Don&#039;t buy from vendors who send from Netherlands. <br /><br />I ordered a month ago from Dr a sample of weed that never arrived. I didn&#039;t thought that I was scammed but more that my letter got seized.<br /><br />Today I got a letter from our customs that said the seized it and wants explanations.<br />By the way I find super silly to give explanations for 1 gram of grass... In what world are we living in???<br /><br />Anyway. I am sure that Dr Earnhardt is a good vendor and I will never have the opportunity to taste his products. But I have to warn also all customers from Sweden not to risk buying stuff from Holland.<br />Better for you, and better for Dr&#039;s reputation.<br /><br />Take care and most of all be safe!<br /><br />Adamiz
