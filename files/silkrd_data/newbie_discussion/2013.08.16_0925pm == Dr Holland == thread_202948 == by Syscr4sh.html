				Too bad you did an FE. I ordered from Dr Holland over a month ago and I&#039;ve received nothing. Ohh, sure, they accepted my TWO 10-day extension resolutions at the last moment before they went to a SR admin, but they haven&#039;t replied to a message I sent asking for some sort of update and they have yet to respond to my latest resolution which is requesting a 100% refund. <br /><br />Since I&#039;ve been ordering from abroad since 1998 I&#039;ve always received one of two things within a month, either my order or a seizure notice, but with Dr Holland I&#039;ve received neither. The lack of communication (even though I see they&#039;re online everyday) coupled with all the bad reviews on the other thread here and on SR makes me believe the order was never even sent.<br /><br />Luckily my order is in escrow, I&#039;m already frustrated with them, but I&#039;d be furious if I had FE&#039;d.<br /><br />

				So, were in the same boat. I ordered the 1g listing as-well. Looks like were scammed i think. But i will give a feedback here. If nothing arrives to all of us. I will advise SR-Admins to take a closer look at him.<br /><br />Tip: JunkyXXL let us newbs stay in Escrow :) Not like the other scammers around who want to scam the newbies. Will give Feedback about him, too.

				I&#039;m currently battling it out in the resolution center, I have a lot of evidence pointing towards them never even sending my order and they want to give a 40% refund. Seeing as it appears they never shipped, I really don&#039;t want to get screwed out of 60% of my money, so I have to allow this transaction to be under review which is something I didn&#039;t want to do.<br /><br />Stay the hell away from Dr Holland and NEVER FE!<br /><br />Over 5 weeks and nothing! No order and no seizure notice, this was just not shipped. <br /><br />Ever notice how all of their 5/5 ratings are FE&#039;s or the lottery game? Then they went into stealth mode and returned with more expensive listings. I think they&#039;re getting everyone to FE now before they take off with all of our money.<br />

				Well, SR stepped in and extended this pointless process for 5 more days, but made sure to mention that if they have to decide I won&#039;t be getting more than 50% refund, which was a dick move on their part IMO. <br /><br />I doubt Dr Holland ever even shipped my damn order, so now I&#039;m probably going to get fucked out of at least half of my money; so much for the highly-lauded escrow system. Obviously the staff member was in a bad mood and didn&#039;t bother to check the FACT that almost all of Dr Holland&#039;s 5/5 ratings are FE or the lottery game and the other ratings are 1/5 with people calling him a scammer. Not to mention the other thread on the forum about Dr Holland which isn&#039;t exactly a glowing endorsement.<br /><br />Dr Holland is pulling a burn on SR now, they went into stealth mode for a while when they were getting shitty reviews, then came back with new listings and EVERYONE is having to FE. After they screw as many people as possible they&#039;ll probably leave and come back on SR as a different vendor and repeat the process.<br /><br />Stay away from these scammers unless you&#039;re feeling generous and just want to piss your money away...<br />

				Agree @Cloquet - It´s tooooooo easy for scammers!<br /><br />Don´t know why the SR-Staff didn´t take a closer look?! And they should be harder with these fucking scammers!<br /><br />He surely has a deposit here - they could give us our money back(so long it´s there).<br /><br />I think i lost my 50€ on the first order with Dr Holland. :( The first order here at SR.<br /><br />Would be really happy when i am wrong and he is a honest Vendor, but i don´t think so. :-\<br /><br />SR should totally shut down FE. The Vendors and scammers got enough money, let them take a bit risk. Now only the customers take the risks especially the newbies.

				I had Dr Holland agreeing to a 60% refund, which I guess I should have taken. I would have if I&#039;d known that the SR staff would completely hobble me by letting both Dr Holland and I know that if we can&#039;t come to an agreement I won&#039;t be getting more than 50%; hmm, do you think Dr Holland is going to offer 60% again now? Hell no, the SR staff (fucking biased prick) totally screwed me out of spite because I made them step in and actually do something.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t want to give in because I&#039;m positive Dr Holland didn&#039;t send my order. The SR staff claims I don&#039;t have enough credibility to warrant any more than 50%, but the main reason I became a SR buyer was to get GBL.&nbsp; I can&#039;t afford to make thousands of dollars worth of transactions just to get good enough stats to warrant a 100% refund from an obvious scammer. I live in the USA and almost NOBODY ships GBL here. It was either Dr Holland that I now know is at least a selective scammer or some people in Thailand and I figured both locations were likely to be scrutinized by customs. Looks like I made a huge mistake going with Dr Holland. If I had received a seizure notice like I always have in the past within a month if my order didn&#039;t show up, it would be one thing, but I haven&#039;t after almost 6 weeks and with all the tricks Dr Holland is playing and the bad reviews I&#039;m sure they screwed me. The name and address I told them to ship to has no seizures linked to it, so this has just been a waste of time and money and and all-around bad experience.<br /><br />Fuck SR in the future, I can&#039;t get GBL anywhere (obviously) and anything else I want I can get without all the hassle of dealing with this bullshit, so they can go screw.<br />

The only time Dr Holland replies is when the resolution is under review, then he behaves like a reasonable gentleman and offers you a 40% refund. I stated my evidence of him scamming as in all the 5/5 ratings being FE or the lottery game and many serious orders being a 1/5. I also mentioned their lack of communication and pointed out the fact that people on this forum were having the same problem, but the SR staff member reviewing the case has pretty much sided with Dr Holland, so good luck with your escrow. <br /><br />I know there are good, honest vendors on SR, but now I&#039;m starting to think the scammers are allowed to scam for a while and they split the pure profit with SR staff, because this one didn&#039;t even bother looking into the case at all.

				My money is still in escrow and the due date extension the SR staff imposed is up in two days. They specifically told me they wouldn&#039;t grant a 100% refund, but I&#039;m still requesting it because it&#039;s so obvious that Dr Holland is a cheating, scamming scumbag. Hopefully the SR staff will actually look into this a bit deeper next time and notice the scam Dr Holland is pulling with all these FE&#039;s.<br /><br />To all those that did an FE, you have my condolences and to anyone with their money in escrow best of luck.

				I placed an order with Dr Holland over a week ago. Thankfully it wasn&#039;t a large order as i,m still finding my feet so sticking to small transactions for time being. <br /><br />I was asked to FE since i,m new and i accept full responsibility for agreeing to do this as i had read that it wasn&#039;t safe to do this...i think i,ve just learned this lesson the hard way. I will never FE again and i,m grateful it took only a small hit to my wallet for me to see why.<br /><br />The current situation appears to be this-<br /><br />As soon as i paid the item was quickly changed to being in transit. I have received nothing nor have i received any notification from either the postal service or customs. This is now over a week...from their country to mine has been 3-4 days i have found in my other transactions with others from that country.<br /><br />Dr Holland is in Stealth Mode and although i,ve emailed today i,m not honestly expecting a reply. I,ve lost my money and chalking it up to experience. In the extremely unlikely event i get the item or a response then bonus but i,m not holding my breath. The only thing that i,m concerned about is that someone who is now appearing to be suspicious has my drop address but i reason that they got the money and won&#039;t need that address for anything...still i,d rather they didn&#039;t have it.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see any listings, feedback has recently plummeted and there are many others who now have said no parcel, no communication from vendor. Learn from my lesson...never FE even if they seem legit and fully check out feedback...alarm bells for lots of&nbsp; &#039;asked to FE&#039;...I saw this but didn&#039;t click it could indicate that a seller is about to clean out as many people as possible before leaving town. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t reported them as yet as i,ve only emailed them today so its only fair i give them a few days.&nbsp; But for all it might be worth in adding my story to the pile&nbsp; i will if/when i don&#039;t hear back

				My first message here on the forums.<br /><br />All my transactions at the silk road were good so far until now. I needed some speed for this weekend, because tomorrow its my birthday. <br /><br />So i decided to order some speed from Dr. Holland, and it is already 3 days ago that i finalized my order. I know that it is stupid, but i know more vendors at the Silk Road who are always asking to finalize early.<br /><br />I send him a few messages, and he doesn&#039;t respond. So i guess i also got scammed for 5grams of speed.<br /><br />I&#039;m still a student, and this was a lot of money for me. And the worst thing is, my birthday is gonna be 1 big disaster without the dope haha!<br /><br />Please SR staff, can you remove Dr. Holland his account or something? It would be a shame, if more people will get scammed by this douchebag.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />pencilsnapper (Netherlands)<br /><br />
