				This has been highly debated over and over but basically if the vendor doesn&#039;t say in his lasting to expect to sign, don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />I would rather be out $150 than go to jail...

				Last week as I was retrieving mail at my box when a clerk asked me to sign for a package ...I recalled I was expecting an over-sized item and I knew it would go smoothly ...but if gut feeling says otherwise the best response is to casually fumble for your wallet and calmly say oops I&#039;ll return in a moment. It is important to go near closing hours (certain exceptions) and to always park a couple blocks away and out of view of any cameras. Never rent a box at a store with it&#039;s own parking section. If it&#039;s a sting operation the clerk will be wired to the lead agent who is cognizant of the legal ramifications of the suspect actually signing for and receiving the package and most likely will keep his team on standby. Be extraordinarily perceptive of your surroundings. When exiting the building do so with your keys dangling and walk towards the parking lot and keep on walking straight out of the area. Be prepared to run. Carry a high voltage tazer. Ideally the setting is near a busy street that can be your escape route if you&#039;re daring. Call your partner to the scene to note any activity that might indicate the presence of surveillance or an attempted controlled delivery. If left uncertain he should return to the area an hour before opening to conduct counter-surveillance until he deems it&#039;s clear and for you to get your plug! Hopefully it won&#039;t happen with the same clerk more than once because you don&#039;t want any suspicion you&#039;ve rented a box using fake ID. The trick is to find someone legally still a juvenile and teach them all these things. If you find a really good one it would be a wise insurance policy to bury a few sticks of dynamite to maybe help get him a reduced sentence in the event something goes wrong.&nbsp;

				Unless you&#039;re into serious weight and already the subject of an investigation, a controlled delivery will be attempted by a few officers in unmarked vehicles, not a SWAT team and helicopters. You shouldn&#039;t be worrying too much about controlled deliveries if you have little or no criminal record and are only receiving personal amounts of soft drugs in your real name. Nevertheless under some circumstances and for some people, getting busted importing even a relatively small amount of drugs like cocaine or heroin means decades in prison. I recommend carrying a tazer not to &quot;attack&quot; cops but to be able to defend yourself from them and their dogs if it could give you the chance to slip away. Don&#039;t forget tazers are non-lethal and cops won&#039;t hesitate to use them on you so don&#039;t give them any more respect than they deserve. You can always ditch your weapon if you see no way out. Don&#039;t brandish it or you likely will get shot. One said &quot;do you think it will only be one cop chasing you?&quot; Eventually hopefully yes. Have you never been chased by police? You avoid wide open spaces and try to lose them in backyards hopping fences; if you can really move at some point there will only be one left behind you. Usually the danger is being tackled trying to get over a barrier. If you elude their initial trap they&#039;ll sic their dog on you if they think you&#039;re still in the area. If you&#039;ve ever been rushed by a dog you should understand the value of a having a tazer.

				When you sign for a parcel surely you&#039;re not incriminating yourself, you are simply acknowledging the receipt of a parcel. You would sign for a parcel if you didn&#039;t know what it was. Or am I missing the point.

				&quot;A signature is not required for a controlled delivery to take place&quot; true <br /><br />my point was missed. if you realize or think you realize that you&#039;re being watched (gut feeling stuff for those who don&#039;t understand), but this only becoming apparent to you the moment you are asked for your signature or you notice something as you approach your box, evasion still remains a good possibility if you&#039;ve got some testicular fortitude. They plan it to move at a very certain point. You&#039;ll need id to retrieve anything too bulky for the box. Smart to know exactly what is expected but easier said than done. At least if it&#039;s in your own name you&#039;re only half caught. Personally if I see any potential threat in the vicinity of my drop, I&#039;ll do a 3-corners and retreat from the area then determine whether I&#039;m compromised or paranoid. Drops must be cycled like cell phones. They do need a signature unless they&#039;re long on your case. Their worst case scenario is to intercept a package addressed to an unknown name or evidently fake driver&#039;s license they have no picture of, only to alert the suspect.&nbsp; The operation may be planned to move in once you produce false id; if you get a gut feeling you must convince anyone listening or observing your body language that you are only momentarily departing course, because if only they hesitate a few seconds you can at least be out of the store. If it&#039;s all in your head the worst you can do is make a little scene by returning to your car to get your wallet, it&#039;s not &quot;refusing to sign&quot;. Once I got jumped by five goons exiting a mall yet somehow managed to escape fortunately for the presence of a busy freeway. We&#039;re talking about risking our freedom. Sadly so far it seems those who would surrender have won the poll.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i simply pick up packages from the po at night time after having checked out any suspect vehicles. its always there, usually ill get some weed and they will leave the key for the bigger box. <br />i used to go during the day,There has been one time where i had a note saying to pick up at the desk. I thought well they got me, no use in avoiding it, take the charge like a man! <br /><br />I went to the desk, handed the lerk the note, they apologized and said all the spillover boxes were full this morning, i said no problem and walked away, smiling as i exited the building!<br /><br />i never get overseas orders to a box though, use a neighbor who isnt home or a friend with a clean house and pay them good. <br /><br />but then again they arent gonna let the package leave there sight.<br /><br />it just depends how much you are willing to go down for!
