				In blockchain or electrum or other wallets, when you have a receive BTC address, and use it, and it gives you a new address after, are those addresses related? I mean is it possible to tell that they belong to the same user / wallet?

You can have a plethora of BTC addresses in your Wallet if your client allows it and many Wallets if so desired. They should (BTC addresses) only be used once and then discarded. A new BTC address for each transaction should be used to minimize the chances of you being linked to more than one transaction should you ever be caught.&nbsp; ;D

				Great, thanks.<br /><br />So if I have BTCaddress1 and BTCaddress2 in my wallet, is it possible for someone to tell, if they have both BTCaddress1 and BTCaddress2, that they are related / come from the same wallet?

Once it&#039;s been used once, disregard it permanently and acquire a new one for your next transaction.&nbsp; :) If the one address is used multiple times, that could allow LE to implicate you in multiple transactions should they be watching your movements.&nbsp; :)

Another member posted a vague name but it wasn&#039;t me. Buying Bitcoins off the road is very risky in that all Bitcoin transactions are NOT covered under the Escrow system, meaning should something go wrong you&#039;re at the mercy of the vendor in question. I personally would never buy Bitcoins off SR for that very reason alone. There are proven BTC vendors like RxKing on SR, who does the right thing by his customers but equally, there are unscrupulous ones ready to pounce on the uninitiated when given the opportunity.

				Sorry about that I copied the wrong username, I fixed it now. Right on yes there are plenty of posts of people who got ripped off in the Moneypak/reloadit transactions. Thanks for the mention of a reputable vendor.
