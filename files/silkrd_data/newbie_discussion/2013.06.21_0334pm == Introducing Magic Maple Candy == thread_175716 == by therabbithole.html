				Hello everyone!&nbsp; We&#039;re the new kids on the block and we&#039;d like to start by thanking Dread Pirate Roberts for making us feel like we&#039;re in the right place.<br /><br />Second... we make magic candy. Our ambition has been to create the hash brownie of the fungus world, and we think Magic Maple Candy is it. Nothing but pure Canadian maple syrup, a touch of coconut oil for smoothness, and 1.0 gram apiece of our own organically grown P. cubensis Amazonia.&nbsp; The smoky, earthy taste of maple doesn&#039;t try to cover up the fungus, but works with it to make the flavour a good thing.<br /><br />Check it out here :<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/12f29c0c43<br /><br />We grow our own carefully maintained strain on 100% organic rye. Tightly controlled conditions ensure consistently high quality and potency. Read our dosing guide to find the right number for you: they&#039;re so good you won&#039;t want to stop at one, but you&#039;d better stop at two unless you really know what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to ask if you have any questions. Thanks!<br /><br />From the Rabbithole.

				That&#039;s a great idea. Lately I&#039;ve noticed psilocybin extracts in the form of chocolates and caramels sold at festivals for their discretion- is this anything like that? Is it packaged like ordinary, legal, non-enlightening candy?

				This is a fabulous idea for a product. Not everyone finds mushrooms good tasting, and I have had mushroom chocolate in the past but it obviously needs to be kept fairly cool or it&#039;ll melt quite easily. It&#039;s also very handy that they are dosed at one gram each. I have just ordered a sample and will update with a review soon!

It&#039;s dried and powdered Cubensis. We make it like ordinary candy but using lower temperatures. It looks like and is packaged like ordinary artisanal candy. We think this would be a great feature, you can&#039;t tell it&#039;s illicit even after opening.<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in trying some, just PM me.<br /><br />From the Rabbithole.

				Just wanted to add my post from the rumor mill to this one!<br /><br />My order was processed with lightening speed and I received the tracking number extremely quickly as well. It made it to me in a grand total of two days domestic, and I nearly fell over when I opened it. I have seen lots of creative packaging during my time here but this vendor really goes above and beyond in terms of packaging, I was extremely impressed. The treats look quite well made and were completely undamaged by the heat which is often an issue for baked goods traveling this time of the year.<br /><br />I have several groups of people who will be reviewing the treats including myself and will update, but for now I just wanted to make Canadian buyers aware of this great new vendor with a very unique and professionally packaged product.

				With the right packaging(heat sealed mylar bags with weather resistant bags) or even a plastic bag with a nutrition label and a sort of &quot;Mom and Pop store&quot; looking brand name, you could make to to at least the US if not other places and once you&#039;re more established as a vendor and have worked out all the kinks I would love to purchase from you.<br /><br />Also you spell &quot;dose&quot; as &quot;doz&quot; which screams unprofessionality at me, unless I&#039;m missing something and &quot;doz&quot; is meant to mean something else entirely.

				I received my sample of 4 candies 3 business days after it was placed in transit. The stealth is very legit- I don&#039;t even want to call it &#039;stealth&#039;, because if it were legal (as it deserves to be) it would be packaged the same way. They arrived just before the Canada day long weekend, so it&#039;s been a while, but I have plans to eat them within the next few days and will review shortly after. They look really, really fucking delicious.
