				Governments, banks, royal families?<br />What do ya reckon?<br />I think some royal families still have control over some nations, but I reckon most people running things don&#039;t care much about nations they just move around according to the global economy. Gov&#039;s pretty much just go on TV etc. in my opinion and don&#039;t really handle many decisions.

				Only about 1/2 of us vote in the US.&nbsp; it sure seems that if the other half voted then Bush, Cheney, Bachman, Cruz and etc would never get elected.&nbsp; My belief is we get the democracy we deserve.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thinking that there&nbsp; are outside controls is just paranoid thinking to me and and an excuse to give up on it.&nbsp; Barak said yesterday that we are becoming a more perfect union, not a perfect one.&nbsp; We have to work at it, take responsibility for it.&nbsp; The Quakers say &#039;spread peace one person at a time&#039;, I can work on me, I can try to grow to be peaceful and authentic.&nbsp; I can&#039;t make you&nbsp; be peaceful and authentic,&nbsp; but if we see one person who is heroic we can try to emulate them.<br /><br />Just my humble opinion.<br />&nbsp;

				It depends on who&#039;s asking...&nbsp; But no bullshit the answer is those who control the Bank of International Settlements, the top fiat money bank regulator on the planet.&nbsp; Please download and see the movie &quot;Thrive&quot; for a succinct explanation of the money and power masters of the world.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t get carried away with the free energy stuff, or the governments will hunt you down..&nbsp; Also their is a complete lack of the spiritual side of the CONTROL issue presented in the movie.&nbsp; Without it though very wise and researched, Mr. Gamble misses the whole point of humans&#039; REAL original sin, and the lies of wealth and to be like gods told by the serpent with legs (Reptilian, demon or alien?!) to the original created humans, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The same lie is told by the same entities to these present world masters in one way or another, &quot;You shall become like God.&quot;

				My Two cents... <br /><br />Depending on where you are in the world there will always be some form of control. Saying that when talking about the World America as a whole would be the biggest controlling group in the world in our time, They are currently the ones to look to when problems arise and the ones who solve them. But beneath the surface who is controlling them?? An example of this was when the Saudi asked for help in taking down of Saddam Hussein. At the time he was seen as a dictator who couldn&#039;t be controlled. America answered there call with assistant to Kuwait to protect its borders from Iraq Republican guard. Now America wouldn&#039;t just help anyone if it wasn&#039;t in there best interest. At the time The Saudi royal family had trillions of dollars in America which equated to (dont quote me on this) about 7% of there national budget which they were threatening to pull out and cash in. if this were to happen it would of devastated Americas stock market.<br /><br />Other groups community and family&#039;s that come to mind are the Jewish community, they would have a major influential role in the controlling of the world with its wealth and long history. The Rothschild a family who have been embedded in the banking and media worlds of the Americas and Great Britain for decades. An older but more religious group would be the Catholic Church representing more then a Billion people world wide and having a 1000 year old traceable history. The Stonemasons who can traced back to the times of BC, who&nbsp; are not as influential as they once were, There traditions see that they will never be lost. <br /><br />My opinion is it all depends at the time...<br /><br /><br />

				Capitalism. The problem is the system that forces people to be corrupt.<br /><br /><br />I like this quote from Terrence McKenna:<br /><br />&quot;Isn&#039;t it so simple to believe that things are run by the greys, and that all we have to do is trade sufficient fetal tissue to them and then we can solve our technological problems, or isn&#039;t it comforting to believe that the Jews are behind everything, or the Communist Party, or the Catholic Church, or the Masons.....I believe that the truth of the matter is far more terrifying, that the real truth that dare not speak itself is that no one is in control, absolutely no one&quot;
