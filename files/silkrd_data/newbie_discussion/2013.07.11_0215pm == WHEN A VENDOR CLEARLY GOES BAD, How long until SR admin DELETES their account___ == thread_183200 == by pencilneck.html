				WHEN A VENDOR CLEARLY GOES BAD, How long until SR admin DELETES their account???<br />IE: Vendor Bazley! <br />3 items i did not get from him, almost 20 of his latest feedback says &quot;Did not get, no communication ETC&quot;, Lastly seen 14 days ago, popped in for a day, wasn&#039;t seen for over a week before then, the bad stats keep coming but I&#039;m out of time. I &quot;warned SR around a month ago things were looking dodgy with him/her, SR did not do anything, since then i have noticed quite a few people have either lost money or been refunded by SR, told them again, still did not DELETE their account, &quot;GOOD STANDING&quot; i believe they put it as, their account. I think i even told them again but still they wont delete their account. I just don&#039;t get it.<br />I did try to ask SR how long they would put up with this vendor and DID NOT GET A REPLY THEN, thought i may ask here and hopefully a big wig or a fellow member in the know can chime in or some shit?<br />Love to get a response, even a &quot;Eat shit&quot; would be better than being ignored?&nbsp; <br />PS: 5 points to the first smart arse who posts &quot;Eat shit&quot;<br />

				Eat the sacred sandwich? Why limit it to just shit, how about a shit buffet? Start with the appetizers of little shit petit fours, perhaps. Then onto entrees, shit paninis, hot pressed fully dressed shit po-boys, and for the hungry man appetite, a poo cano of monstrous proportions. Dessert: shit souffle, shit pudding, and a chocolate shit cookie.<br /><br />In my best Julia Child &quot;Bon apetit!&quot; In my best Sean Connery, &quot;Trebek, I&#039;ll take bon ape tit for $200.&quot;<br /><br />Trebek &quot;That&#039;s bon APPETITE, Mr. Connery.&quot;

				no more drugs for you dude! Missed the 5 points also as an &quot;Eat Shit&quot; what what was required to win. Read the instructions...My your kitchen must smell, or do you save time and have a cooker in the bathroom?<br /><br />Anyone else have a clue about anything i wrote other than &quot;shit&quot;
