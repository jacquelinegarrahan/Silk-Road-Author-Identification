				<br />&nbsp;Hey everyone my first order here was FM and his N°3 Heroïn...<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m not a heroïn addict at all, 6 months or even more since a last took a sniff of that.<br /><br />&nbsp;First try was like : Omg fucking stoned as hell for 0,1 g. I did not puke but that was hard to retain it...<br /><br />&nbsp;Second try : Took a bit more than 0,1. Could not even follow the discussion on the internet, forgetting where i was and stuff, so, fuckign stoned as hell but i had no impression of &quot;good feeling&quot; that should procure heroïn. I puked once after 20 minutes which is normal i suppose for this kind of drug when you&#039;re not used to it for someone like me.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now, in the morning i have the bad feeling as if something were stuck in my throat, can&#039;t stop burping I just puked 20 minutes ago, puked all the product i sniffed yesterday...<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m no professional of Heroïn but I feel like i were scammed by this FM, this &quot;uncut&quot; batch is a joke I think, my friend who takes heroïn regularly will test it and will tell me for sure if that is a big shit or not...<br /><br />&nbsp;In addition i&#039;m going to take a sample and test it somewhere by medical personnel, i wanna know what&#039;s inside. I&#039;ll let you know.<br /><br />&nbsp;On the other hand if this product is total scam, shit and dangerous for your health I will publish public results and discredit this guy as much as I can.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m new here but this market is sooo interesting, i want to help the whole community as I can.<br /><br />&nbsp;did someone try this batch and have something else to say or agree with what I said ?<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks for reading.

				Interesting post...<br /><br />1.) No.3 heroin is usually smoked on foil or injected.&nbsp; Did you try chasing it on foil?&nbsp; Easier to control your dose that way, rather than snorting an &#039;estimated&#039; dose.<br />2.) Not sure how effective No.3 is when snorted, but since it&#039;s a very fine powder I expect a lot of it may have bypassed your nasal mucus membrane and impacted your throat and upper respiratory tract.&nbsp; Probably not that pleasant and not surprising you were sick.&nbsp; I doubt you would&#039;ve absorbed a great deal.<br />3.) No.4 heroin, like cocaine is a hydrochloride, and is therefore ideal for snorting since it&#039;s easily absorbed into the mucus membrane inside the nose.&nbsp; &nbsp;Try snorting some of Franks no.4 and you&#039;ll know about it!&nbsp; Start small though. It&#039;s strong.<br />4.) It&#039;s unlikely you&#039;re going to discredit Frank Matthews as he&#039;s one of the top vendors, with over 1,000 fans, and doing 100&#039;s of transactions per week.<br />5.) Experienced heroin users have written countless positive reviews about all his products on his official review thread.&nbsp; I think these will outnumber the account of an inexperienced user such as yourself (no offense).<br />6.) I&#039;ve had 20+ orders from Frank (various products) and have been 100% satisfied.&nbsp; His #3 heroin, although maybe not the very best I&#039;ve ever had, is certainly the real deal, and way better than street gear in the UK. <br /><br />I&#039;m only a part time user of H and other opiates, but have been doing them a long time.&nbsp; If you have a problem with Franks stuff and there is genuinely something wrong with it, message him.<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />Part Time Fiend

				<br />&nbsp;Thanks for the answer but as I said and you mentionned it as well :<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m a huge newbie concerning Heroïn and opioids, i won&#039;t discredit Frank if i&#039;m wrong or something, this is why i start by asking here.<br /><br />&nbsp;I need advices from heroïn users for my opinion to be truly effective.<br /><br />&nbsp;My friend who is on heroïn for 15 years is gonna taste it very soon and gonna tell me what&#039;s wrong or if I am wrong.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t want to discredit Frank if this is good stuff.<br /><br />&nbsp;But imagine thats it&#039;s bad and I publish real medical results for his dope ? and report him ?<br /><br />&nbsp;I may be new here, i&#039;m sure it has an importance...<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway i&#039;ll update this post ASAP when i&#039;ll know more about this stuff and get different point of views from professionals using this drug.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m just wondering, i&#039;m not accusating...<br /><br />&nbsp;But i&#039;m sick as hell and I can tell you I feel fucking bad and I have no fucking pot to feel better :(

				<br />&nbsp;By the way, do you think N°3 would be more efficient or appreciated by blood injection ? (i won&#039;t do that, it&#039;s for my friend who&#039;s gonna taste it)<br /><br />&nbsp;Nevertheless, i think i&#039;m too much of a noob and I have to stay away from these kind of drugs. (I mean opioïds, heroïn, these stuffs.)<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll stick with alcohol and Hasch and weed :D<br /><br />&nbsp;And i&#039;m definitely against heroïn from now on. This is finished for me.

				<br />&nbsp;I think u don&#039;t understand my statement Northernstar...<br /><br />&nbsp;I said i&#039;m a huge noob in heroïn and in my opinion yes, i think you&#039;re right, but i want to be sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;As I said a friend of mine is going to try it because i simply don&#039;t have enough knowledge of that drug. (I bought it for him at first all I need is weed or hasch, i&#039;m not fond of heroïn at all).<br /><br />&nbsp;I just wanted to try it before taking it to my friend. In my opinion, i only tried low quality heroïn and everything went fine with it but this one is stronger and so I get sick...<br /><br />&nbsp;My friend told me like you that if i keep vomiting it&#039;s a proof this is good product.<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t want any answer from Frank because i simply asked nothing from him. I don&#039;t want to tell him &quot;your product sucks&quot; if not...<br /><br />&nbsp;I created this post to have external opinions no need to call me a fool or something else...
