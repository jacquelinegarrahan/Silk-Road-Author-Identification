				Anybody remember the phishing site that asked you for your pin in the homepage? And once you log in there was a seizure notice?&nbsp; If I remember correctly the seizure notice for the real site looks almost identical to that one. <br /><br />Also,<br /><br />When they took over tormail, what did it say?

				Wow all over the mainstream media, hoping someone has a cached copy of the site so we can get dealers emails that kept them on their profiles?<br /><br />

My package went out via Priority mail on Monday and should be here by now, since USPS changed their Priority service to be guaranteed based on location and it is always two days with this guy. A third day may be no big deal--maybe he dropped it off post cutoff or whatever, but... I didn&#039;t receive ANY mail today except for a slip that was left for a package unrelated to SR. They wanted me to sign for it even though it is a normal monthly item that I never have to sign for and always fits in the mailbox. The postal dude wrote the words &quot;not safe&quot; on the slip--not sure what that means but it&#039;s sure fueling my paranoia.
