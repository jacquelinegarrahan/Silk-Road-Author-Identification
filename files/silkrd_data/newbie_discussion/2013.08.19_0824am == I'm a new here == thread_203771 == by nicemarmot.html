				I am really irritated with this site. I can&#039;t find any legitimate sites to buy bitcoins. I am a long-term opiate addict and i thought this place would be my savior after talking to a friend who only believes in getting personal use. I live in a dead ass over inflated area and can&#039;t find anything worth buying. I have a good job and I need what I need. Please give me some input on how to invest in some bitcoins without being ripped off.

				Just keep trying man. I don&#039;t know what to recommend in terms of buying bitcoins, but the heroin here is better than anything you&#039;ll ever see on the street. It&#039;ll be worth all the wait :)

				I used Bitstamp.com, Pain in the ass to do an international wire though....<br />From wiring from my bank to acceptance by bitstamp, 4 days<br />transfer to my bitcoin wallet, instant<br />Transfer BTC to Silk road, 3-4 hours<br /><br />Total transaction cost: wired $1800, recieved $1736 after fees, plus the 40 my bank charged.<br />so about $100 cost to wire 1800.<br /><br />Good luck.

				What country? Bitbargain.co.uk is quick and easy but it&#039;s UK only. Localbitcoins is also good, works in most countries too.

				try from localbitcoins/bitcointalk with escrow/ SR&nbsp; if you&#039;re not happy with this, try okpay&gt;&gt;btc-e. i think&nbsp; you need&nbsp; to try to be secure after you start to move btc to sr and purchase from SR. buying btc is normal now :).

				Sorry everyone. I&#039;ve had a rough few days. I haven&#039;t felt like messing with this bitcoin issue in the midst of wd&#039;s. To answer the ?&#039;s, I&#039;m in the US... In the shit midwest. I have to drive 100 miles to find the closest bitcoin person on localbitcoins.com. I really wish I could just do this with a greendot. I am pretty sketched out on this whole bitcoin concept to begin with. I&#039;m probably going to pass on this silk road. I had high hopes when I first heard of it, but now it seems as if the hassle isn&#039;t worth it. I have regular money. It&#039;s not good enough, so fuck it. Shit, I&#039;m irritated.

				Nicemarmot, people on localbitcoins offer bank transfer services. When I first started out I used a cash in the mail btc vendor, I&#039;m sure you have a few of them in the US. It&#039;s worth a shot man.

I&#039;m not &quot;mad&quot; though. Just irritated.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you would be a wee bit bothered if you were dopesick and unable to get something you need that is right in front of your face.

				No worries, and if you do go for a cash in the mail vendor make sure it&#039;s one with a lot of positive feedback.

				It&#039;s not impossible just kind of a pain in the ass. <br />Like I said the &quot;hardest&quot; part was the international bank transfer since that seems to be the only option left for US residents right now, but once that was done it was easy. started this whole journey on Aug 14, and I&#039;ve got 6 Silk Road orders and 3 from Atlantis now. Don&#039;t give up! Or do, whatever... Your Life.<br />
