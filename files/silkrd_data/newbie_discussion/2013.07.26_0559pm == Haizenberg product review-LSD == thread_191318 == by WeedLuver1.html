				Hey SR forums members,I just wanted to share with you my experience with LSD.<br />So a week and a half ago I bought 5 blotters of LSD from Haizenberg (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b8a261bdb6),and tested them with my friends yesterday.<br />I received them exactly a week after order,in great stealth!<br />We were 4 friends: 3 of us took one blotter (its the first time for all of us)and the 4th friend just sitted.laughed and was watching us(no blotters taken).<br /><br />So one of my friend got an empty friend&#039;s house and we decided to take the blotters there,each one of us put the blotters on the tongue for 20 minutes and after that we chewed them and swallowed.<br />And now the waiting is began,after half hour i looked at one of house&#039;s rooms and saw a light,it was dark room with no light in there so it was weird lol ,and when i looked at the ceiling where was lightning-it become brighter but nothing special yet.<br />we waited for something around hour and didnt got any special feelings,and when we thought that nothing will happen everything happened.<br /><br />I became a bit hyperactive,as well as my friends and than we felt an euphoric feelings and visuals become more clearer.<br />It was our first time and we didnt know the best setting for this kind of thing so we just tried different things once in a while (unfortunately we didnt have any nature close by),we started watching TV from beginning and this friend&#039;s house have some trippy and special statues like mushroom people that i remember that was smiling at me.<br />When we watched the TV we just changed stations and the trip adapted to the movie or series.I remember we stopped at the movie American Pie (if im not wrong,it was the first one)and I and my friend saw the actors face and body change,like the body become very long or thin and their face become fatter or they eyes changed locations.<br /><br />I also brought my Ipod so I tried to listen to different types of music I like,Like dark psytrance and pink floyd&#039;s dark side of the moon album...<br />immediately after wearing the earphones and started the psytrance I entered to other world,another dimension.<br /><br />in some point I became hungry so we decided to head to the local mini market,I admit i was a bit afraid because i didnt know how i would act outside,<br />so i enter the mini market and decided to take a snack when i handed the money i looked on the sellers eye and his eye colors changed.<br /><br />after a while one of my friend had to return to her home(her home is nearby,5 minutes walk),we walked outside again and we walked pass a park and decided to stay a bit there,we were something like an half&nbsp; hour there and i just stared at the light pole and he become more and more brighter and changed his form.<br />we escorted our friend and returned to the apartment..the trip lasted for another hour and a half,maybe two(the trip feelings became faded but still was there)<br /><br />I stayed with only one friend(the watcher was a long ago gone and so is the other friend)and I said I got a joint of some A grade AK47,I didnt want to mix weed with lsd because i was afraid of the consciousness(after all,it was my first time with LSD).<br />It was a very small joint (0.14 g and i shared half of it with the friend)and i didnt thought it will have any effect,i was wrong. it was one of my highest moments that last for 2-3 hours (intense) and after that the after effects and the fading high feeling for like more 4-5 hours.<br />we watched some tv and suddenly there was a britney spears song of smurfs,it was trippy as fuck all become 3D the smurfs come out of the TV...at some point my friend said i answered the actors questions and started to talk to actors and they talked to me.<br />It was awesome experience!!Thanks Haizenberg !<br /><br />As for the seller,Haizenberg ,He is very trusted person,<br />got an amazingly good prices for his products and i was very satisfied with the communications with him.<br />also,he promised me not once but twice a bonus on my next order!<br />I&#039;ll defiently buy again from him for my next LSD experience.<br />i forgot to tell i tripped so hard i lost the other 2 blotters in the apartment lol(all the time it was in my wallet but i couldnt find it anywhere).<br /><br />

				Thanks for the report, glad you enjoyed your first time, and it is comforting that Haizenberg LSD got delivered, i order exactly a week a go from him and still waiting.<br /><br />i guess he got his page for trip reports and he got a link for it in his vendor page, but i assume this is the one :<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166614.0<br /><br />and since you got an account with less than 50 posts i guess you cant post over there, the same in my case with this new account, so i guess i might slap my report here when i get my stuff&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />enjoyed reading your trip buddy ...
