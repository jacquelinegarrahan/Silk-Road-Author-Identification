				Hi All, <br /><br />I see quite a mix about the whole principal about finalizing early and escrow with new account holders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just wanted to see what people think about this. <br /><br />For instance a buyer attempts to make a buy from a seller for $300 worth of product but this is the buyer&#039;s first purchase.&nbsp; As a seller, this is not exactly the most comforting situation.&nbsp; Now as a seller, if you&#039;re using tracking and it comes down to resolution, does the seller have the right to submit a copy of&nbsp; receipt showing the buyer&#039;s information and proof that it was delivered? <br /><br />Personally I think the whole purpose of using tracking resolves this issue, but as a seller you&#039;re not suppose to keep this information once you put the sell &quot;Into Transit&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems like a little contradiction but if a seller can keep the tracking information, then escrow seems like an extremely efficient system and it prevents buyer who try to scam and it also helps prevent sellers trying to scam buyers.&nbsp; No proof of tracking and the seller should cough up a refund if it&#039;s their fault.<br /><br />Appreciate any feedback!<br /><br />M :P

Some vendors may have a policy that you will have to FE if you choose to order from them, and once they reach 30+ sales and have been vending for 1 month or more they are entitled to do this, but you are not required to FE under any circumstances.<br /><br />If you place an order with a vendor that asks for FE (when entitled to do so) as part of their store policy then they will likely cancel your order. Always read a vendor&#039;s page in full before attempting to do business with them. I would recommend always going with a vendor that does not require FE as once you go outside of escrow you have no comeback in the event that the product does not arrive.<br /><br />As far as tracking goes, a vendor is not permitted to keep addresses after the order has been sent (and indeed an address is automatically deleted once a vendor marks an order &#039;in transit&#039;), however they are allowed to retain DCN and tracking numbers to assist with any potential resolution that may be entered into. If there is a dispute then the seller is entitled to provide those numbers to the administrator dealing with the resolution.<br /><br />Libertas

				Dont do it. Escrow is there for a reason, it protects everyone, so use it.<br />I never had to FE for anyone as a new buyer. If you&#039;re a new buyer perhaps you shouldnt make huge orders to begin with anyway. Do a few small transactions to get your stats and confidence up.<br />And as a vendor, Ive never asked anyone to FE, not even new buyers. Escrow is there for a reason. A tracking number can help a lot.

				I&#039;ve done it on most of my new purchases as a new buyer but always with low amounts (&lt;$50 USD) and with buyers with high ratings. All of them but one have come through -- still willing to give this vendor the benefit of the doubt as it&#039;s currently at 18 days from EU, but other overseas orders have all arrived within ~1 week and overall I&#039;m not getting a great feeling about it as the vendor in question has been less active on SR lately and a couple of recent pieces of feedback have indicated non-delivery. I&#039;m not sure how the resolution process works, but from a vendor&#039;s perspective there&#039;s less to lose for a buyer with 0 transactions to scam a vendor than a vendor who has a reputation to uphold has to gain by scamming a buyer.<br /><br />Common sense would dictate that, if you do FE, to only do so for a reputable vendor and be suspicious of prices that are way too low. And, obviously, don&#039;t FE on any amount you could not afford to lose.

				i think it is worthwhile to look around for a vendor who wont make you finalize early, as it seems you are more likely to get selectively scammed if you are a new buyer. It might be a bit more expensive or not in the biggest quantity, but it lets you learn the ropes of the system before putting lots of money on the line. I haven&#039;t FE and havent had too much trouble finding vendors who dont ask for it.

				I wasn&#039;t required to FE when I was a new buyer, and as a vendor, I don&#039;t need new buyers to finalize early.&nbsp; Escrow + tracking protects vendors too.

				After lucydrop drops major scam, FE was accepted by the majority as being a put on the fast lane to getting screwed. Lucy proved that even long time, trustworthy people can just go rouge one day and fuck tons of money out of people who trusted him.

				Do not FE. The second purchase I made on SR the seller sent me a pm to &quot;please help me out and FE&quot;. I declined. As the auto-finalize date got closer, I contacted the seller and we both decided that I would go to resolution and add 10 days extention. 8 days later, my order showed up. I may never know if the seller would have screwed me if I had FE&#039;d, but because I did not, I got what I paid for. The only time I personally can see FE&#039;ing is after a seller and I have had a few orders together. Even then, I probably would not FE. I always Finalize as soon as I get the order and it is what I ordered. On the other hand, buyers that do not Finalize quickly after they receive their order is the reason some sellers require FE. It goes both ways, I stick to not screwing with a seller and so far, have not been screwed by a seller. A few bad apples can ruin a delicious apple pie. ;)

				As others have said DO NOT FE! EVER! So many people are scammed by FEing.<br /><br />There are vendors who do not require n00bs to FE. Use them.
