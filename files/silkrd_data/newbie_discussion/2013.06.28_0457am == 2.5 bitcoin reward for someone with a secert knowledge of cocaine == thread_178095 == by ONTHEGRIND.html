				I agree with RiksKim...and my 2 ¢, keep your stuff more pure, charge appropriately and keep a happy customer base.&nbsp; The first time I order that shit from you/someone like you, I&#039;m not ordering again.&nbsp; As a frequent recreational user (aka, not an addict) I still think I&#039;d be able to tell.&nbsp; You&#039;ll really piss off an addict, they&#039;ll know on first bump or whatever their method of delivery.<br /><br />On a side note, if you cannot get the info yourself through your connections or discovering methods online etc then you probably should stick to middle man work.

				Probably no one listens ne ways but just for the record i have no intention of selling &quot;fake&quot; fishscale here on silk road. If that was my intention i definitly would not post on the silk road forum asking how to do it lol.<br /><br />Believe it or not not everyone in the real world is willing to pay top dollar for the best product. I have guys that want to pay 140 bucks a ball 3.5g How is that supposed to be real cocaine? If you want to pay half the price then u get half the product and i am simply doing those people the favour of trying to make the product look/be proffesional as possible not just coke with caffiene and inositol squished in a press lol. Believe me i wish i had 100 customers like you guys that pay 100$ a gram + but in the street that doesnt prove 2 be true. anyways, Thanks 2 all the real ppl that msgd me!
