				I have to hit refresh like 5 times to load the site once, and a minute later it&#039;s not loading again.<br />Almost impossible to use, what to say if you have to list 10-20 products.<br />Is it just me? Any way to improve the speed?

If I use the site in the morning or early afternoon I usually don&#039;t have connectivity problems so maybe you should try a few different moments during the day.

				depends on how low my pants are for me. If they&#039;re just waist height, I can&#039;t get a clear connection, but if I put them around my pants and watch some porn, the connection is top notch, everything loads really fast. Bangbros helps more than others for some reason.

				I&#039;ve seen some links that mention a dedicated access to TOR.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t looked into it yet though.&nbsp; TOR is just slow I guess.&nbsp; The price of security.

				Yep, TOR is also to blame, but in a good way. tbh I don&#039;t mind, but must be a pain in the ass for vendors having to message a lot of people.
