				So, I am somewhat of a new vendor (been on the road for a month), and can&#039;t sell my MDMA, even after dropping the prices over an over. Although new, I have stellar feedback, a very appreciative customer base (all things considered, and offer a great alternative from buying stuff from overseas (I only ship domestically to the US).<br /><br />Is traffic on the road down, or am I just doing everything wrong? All my samples offered are gone...guess I am just looking for some advice. Any help?<br /><br />Regards,<br />STUDY BUDDY

				I&#039;ve check out your store before (after becoming aware of your existence in your other thread that I commented in) and, to be honest, I was immediately turned off by your price. <br /><br />I understand you&#039;re USA domestic only which is awesome but so is this: <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/cb3cfac85a<br />As far as SR shipping goes, I basically consider Canada USA because I&#039;ve never had any difficulties with packages from Canada and they normally arrive pretty damn fast. <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/41611f9166<br />Then there&#039;s this guy who has a great track record: <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1d018ddcf4<br /><br />Those are just some listings for 1 gram of MDMA that are in my bookmarks.<br /><br />Then keep in mind its another $10 just for your shipping. <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to put you down or anything. After all, who the fuck am I to tell you how to run your business? You seem like you honestly want help so I&#039;m honestly trying to help you.

				You&#039;re one of few who&#039;s ever understood my honesty. I piss people off all the time because they get offended for no reason so I try to make it a point to not come off as offensive when I remember haha. Happy to help a new vendor, especially US (&quot;my country&quot;) domestic MDMA (&quot;my drug&quot;) lol. Who knows, I may end up ordering from you in the future. You mentioned you sent out samples. Do you have an official review thread? I&#039;m sure that&#039;ll help haha

				Unfortunately, I do not. I am still a noob on the forums.<br /><br />I have been up to sate (since early 2011) on everything outside of the forums. Now, I am playing catch-up, and need help...

				Here&#039;s my advice: start an &#039;official review thread&#039; in the newbie section. Everybody can post there so it doesn&#039;t matter. You just want all your reviews in one area. What were all the samples you sent out for if not reviews? I see you got some in your vendor feedback which is good but those are all only a sentence or two. People who care normally will go to the forums to check out a vendor before buying. If you want, you can contact PrincessHIGH about moving your thread. She&#039;s known for &quot;moving&quot; (quoting with consent) new vendors&#039; official review pages to the rumor mill. <br />If you can&#039;t get in contact with her for some reason, I&#039;m willing to help.

				Try and contact the people you gave samples to and get them to post a review in your thread as well, that&#039;s what samples are for after all. People should be pretty happy to do it if you gave them free/discounted stuff. <br /><br />For people with only a few transactions every month SR doesn&#039;t show a score out of 100 so the forums are the only way of knowing what you and your product are like, a review thread is essential. Good luck.

				Your prices are OK but not the cheapest.<br /><br />Once you establish your reputation you will have many orders, it may take a while to gain trust.<br /><br />Having a strong forum presence, and many reviews will build your reputation and get you more orders.<br /><br />Just stay true to your word and people will notice!
