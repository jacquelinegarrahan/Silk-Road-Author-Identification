				I agree, people who don&#039;t read vendors pages and agree to terms and have the nerve to leave bad feedback is unforgivable. <br />I&#039;ve seen it many a time, you can see a vendor has clearly labelled a product of a certain quality and to not expect more, and yet people still expect more.<br />A three-strike system is what i suggest to be imposed for minor misdemeanors, and a immediate ban for worse offenses (scamming, not reading the vendors page and leaving bad feedback).<br />SR is some people&#039;s livelihood,&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand the need to infringe on that.<br /><br />Of course, then comes the question of who decides the proceeding strikes and banning which takes manpower and time and therefore money. It can&#039;t be left to vendors due to bias, and must be observed by an outsider.<br /><br />Peace <br />Astrona

				SR is so important to vendors and buyers alike. However, as newbie it seems that vendors have alot more power on the road than buyers. If a buyer leaves anything less than stellar feedback they&#039;ll be blacklisted in the vendor community. What if the product was not as described or shipping took forever or communication was terrible. Then again if a vendor is repeatedly poor it makes it into the forums and percentages do go down.
