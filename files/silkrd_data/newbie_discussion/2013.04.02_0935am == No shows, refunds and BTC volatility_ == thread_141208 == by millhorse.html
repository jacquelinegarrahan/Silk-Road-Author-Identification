				I placed an order over a month ago that has never shown up. No big deal, was bound to happen eventually, and the vendor has stayed in touch and suggested a 50% refund. I am at his mercy too &#039;cos I was going to be offline for a bit and FE&#039;d based on his feedback and the assumption that the order would arrive long before I was back online.<br /><br />The dilemna:<br />I paid him 2.5BTC over a month ago. I have not had the use of those coins for over a month.<br />But the value of BTC has soared in that month. A 50% refund, or 1.25 BTC could let me place the same full order again, with change.<br />If I bought something on Amazon that never showed up, I would get the money I paid back regardless of whether the price had been reduced in the meantime. Likewise, if I bought something in a bricks and mortar shop that developed a fault, I would be entitled to my money back, even if the item was now reduced in a sale.<br /><br />So what&#039;s fair now?<br />Do I get my 1.25 bitcoins back? Remember I have still lost half of my outlay.<br />Do I get the bitcoin equivalent of half of the dollar value of the bitcoins I paid a month ago. This would be much less than a quarter of what&nbsp; paid in BTC and I have also been without the use of my coins for over a month.<br /><br />Interested to hear what folks think is a reasonable outcome here.<br /><br />Other thought: The out and out cynic in me wonders is this part of a SR business model? If I&#039;m a vendor I can decide to simply not send every tenth order from a new customer. Worst case scenario, I get to keep half the money every time and I still get enough positive feedback to keep people buying. Best case scenario, I keep all the money for over a month, BTC more than doubles in value and I eventually refund about a fifth of what I was paid. Added bonus, with the free money I get doing this I can subsidise my prices to keep them among the lowest on SR, ensuring an ever widening customer base to rob 10% of.<br /><br />Thoughts?

Back when I was trading I had to point out to customers that I also lost out if the Bitcoin dipped in value as it did quite dramatically last August for instance after the Pireat40 Ponzi collapsed, so it does work both ways.<br /><br />If you&#039;re offered the USD equivalent of 50% of your original order I would suggest you accept it and plough your Bitcoins into the Bitcoin Stock exchange, invest in a mining rig or similar and sit on top of the dividends, you&#039;ll make your original order back and more with luck. The Bitcoin is likely to increase in value even further before it comes crashing back down to earth.<br /><br />V.
