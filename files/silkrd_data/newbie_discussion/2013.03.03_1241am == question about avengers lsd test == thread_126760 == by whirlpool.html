				I am assuming because he/she is still new to the game, and that is the nly thing. In time if the reviews are right and they keep it real I am willing to bet Tess will make it up there. I just ordered from TESS myself!

				Yes that test result is that of a perfect L nik test. The reason that Tess is yet to be star, is most probably because the masses have yet to praise. Yes Tess&#039; L is fucking 100% legit, and usually dosed to the teeth, i was one of the first to test and review his tabs some months back, and i vouch for the product through and through, but their prices are far to unreasonable for many people liking.<br /><br />IMO this is why they&#039;ve yet to become star vendors. Just as when JOR came around, it wasnt more than maybe 2-3 weeks before The lord of Rave was named Star. Tess will be there soon enough, once they contour their numbers more towards the real L heads, and not just the social buyers. Aside from their prices, i cant see why they wouldnt be Star material yet, great doses, great shipping times, good stealth, and great customer service. Much love
