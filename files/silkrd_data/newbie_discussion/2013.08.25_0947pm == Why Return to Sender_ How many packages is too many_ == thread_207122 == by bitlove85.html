				Hey,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using SR for awhile, and read the forums daily, just never registered... I was reading the thread started by a UPS employee, and people often say things like &quot;open it remove the drugs then close it back and write return to sender.&quot; . When I get my packages, I simply shred the label and throw them away. Why would you mark them &quot;return to sender&quot; and send the vendor back an empty box? Wouldn&#039;t marking so many packages as return to sender be suspicious and a waste of time? Or is there reasoning for this that I don&#039;t understand...<br /><br />Question 2...If you get a large quantity of packages from &quot;random&quot; places, would you be flagged?<br /><br />Thanks

				I agree that it may seem odd to send all these back, but it does have its purpose. USPS is obviously run by the government and we, as citizens, have rights to do what we want. If these boxes contain nothing that we are sending back, then there is no reason to flag your address. Anyone can send anything to anyone over the mail. They will only seize it for reasonable cause.. meaning it smells funny, comes open.. basically dumb mistakes made by vendors.<br /><br />When you send it back, you are putting an action to the words, &quot;this wasn&#039;t for me. Must be a wrong address.&quot; Thus you are saying that this was never intended for you, so you have no connection to the parcel.

				Normal people don&#039;t &quot;return to sender&quot; packages on a regular basis. Doing this is not only a waste of time but it will make the people that work at your post office wonder what is wrong with you. Please don&#039;t act like a fool somewhere that you go to pickup drugs.
