				Hi Silk Roaders,<br />I,d appreciate your advice on two points if you would be so kind.<br /><br />1. Do I have to use PGP? I will eventually but to make my first order i,m honestly not that concerned about it. If i order a bit of weed i don,t feel to worried.. If i,m caught i,ll take my lumps, won,t be the first time i,ve been arrested. But do vendors care about this?<br /><br />2. After lurking and educating myself somewhat it seems that buyers are really focused on the possibility of getting scammed or ripped off. But if we always buy from vendors that have shown themselves over and over to be honest, what is the issue? I understand that even the most trusted person can one day disappoint, but generally speaking, i would think that sellers with an good and established record can be relied on. Am i way off base here?<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, I,ve learned from my lurking that FE is a no-no and therefore is a non-negotiable Fuh-geta-bout-it for me. Out of the question so i feel i,ll be protected there,<br /><br />Please let me know what you think. I,m itching to make my order.<br />

				I&#039;m pretty sure majority of people are going to recommend ALWAYS using PGP.
