				My brain hurts from trying to do this. It took me 2 hours to figure out the tor browser thing. Then I had to figure out what bitcoins were. Please explain what I need to do as if I&#039;m retarded. Because, I think I am. I&#039;m wanting Ox30mg or BTH .5 -1g. I don&#039;t shoot or smoke. I have a &quot;wallet&quot; set up for bitcoins. No fucking idea how that works aside from &quot;virtual currency&quot;. I&#039;ve figured out what FE means and know not to do it. I&#039;m in the biggest state in the nation and its a small town. The biggest thing here is meth and I don&#039;t do it. No doctors are prescribing pain pills to young people here. Dude, I just want some relief for my pain. I&#039;m good on everything else. Can someone please help me? I&#039;m so confused and frustrated. Help a newbie out, please!

				Think about this..<br /><br />There is literally thousands upon thousands of SR users that do not even know that these forums exist, let alone come in and learn here. Now all of those people managed to figure out how to use SR, btc and what have you and odds say that none of them are any smarter than your average bear. <br /><br />Read read read..knowledge is power my friend.

				There are two important things you&#039;ll have to learn before you make your purchase.<br /><br />1) How to buy bitcoins so do a search for this in the forums (if you&#039;reAmerican this should be fairly easy to do there seems to be a lot of options for you guys). Then click on your SR account to get the wallet number to send them to and sent them. It can take a few hours for them to transfer.<br /><br />2) Google Kleopatra and then download and install it. This is for using pgp to encrypt your address and other personal details. It&#039;s pretty easy to use. I&#039;m a complete technophobe and I learn to use it in about an hour.<br /><br />Why not get started on those two and keep coming back here with questions as they arise. There are a lot of really helpful people here.<br /><br />The best of luck.

				Oracle13, <br /><br />one thing to remember is to write down your SR username, password and the pin, do the same thing for your wallet.<br /><br />when you do a transaction, you&#039;ll be asked for a pin or a password, and if you forgot it, you&#039;ll end up locked out of your bitcoins.<br /><br />as goldenrod mentioned, use the wallet address to buy or transfer bitcoins, you&#039;ll have in your SR account page bitcoin address for SR - use that one to receive the bitcoins from your wallet.<br /><br />once you transfer from the wallet to your SR address, it&#039;ll take a while, maybe an hour or more.<br /><br />after you&#039;ll see your balance on SR, and then you buy what you need, remember to make sure you&#039;ve got all passwords and pin working properly.<br /><br />there are some basic &quot;how to&quot; bitcoin tutorials on youtube.

				In order to get actual funds into my Silk Road account, I made a different bitcoin wallet on coinbase.com, to use as an intermediary. I then used bitinstant (google it) to buy bitcoins for the coinbase wallet, then changed the coinbase wallet address. I then sent the bitcoins to my current Silk Road address (you can add another coinbase account to the chain here if you want), which I then change (I usually change the coinebase address here yet again).<br /><br />As far as finalizing early, as far as I&#039;m concerned I&#039;ll never do it, even with a trusted vendor (this seems to be the conventional wisdom). You might not have that luxury based on the vendor availability for what you want (I just smoke weed). Essentially that allows the vendor complete immunity to any issues that may happen (delay, didn&#039;t show up, bad quality, etc). You&#039;ve already finalized and given them your money; transaction complete.<br /><br />Just my two cents, good luck dude :)

				Stay anonymous.&nbsp; Look into bitinstant.&nbsp; <br /><br />A good method would be: bitinstant -&gt; bitcoin wallet -&gt; bitcoin fog -&gt;&nbsp; SR bitcoin address

				MedicineWoman has a free guide you could read. They say it&#039;s directed towards buyers with little to no background in Bitcoin.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d05b9deccc<br /><br />I&#039;ve not read it myself so I can&#039;t attest for how good it is, but when it&#039;s free I suppose you&#039;ve got nothing to lose!

				Hello. Oracle, Which country are you in then?<br />Do you know what you want to buy, and how much that is is Bitcoins? If you would like to PM me, I can talk you through the whole procedure step by step, I&#039;m not busy. What is the Silk Road&nbsp; url (web address) that you&#039;re using? Is it&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion ? It should be. There&#039;s many scams you need to learn about. Never enter your pin on the login screen.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
