				Placed an order with xinhai for 250mg for about 30$ <br /><br />Stealth was fantastic. One of the trickiest I have seen. <br />Product were slightly murky crystals with just a tiny bit of crushed in the bottom of the bag. no powder. <br /><br />It took about 6 days from time I place the order. For some this may be disappointing, but anytime I order from the SR I prepare myself to wait up to a week just to avoid the possible disappointment, but I still check the mail every day in hopes hehehe. <br /><br />I&#039; had never done Methamphetamine, so I can&#039;t guarantee it&#039;s the highest quality product. I will tell you one thing though. I had the greatest time of my life. <br /><br />I snorted a weighed dose of 50mg and the second I felt that burn my love affair began :) <br /><br />I stayed up all night just buzzing about, switching between cleaning and futilely trying to get an erection. When it came time for school in the morning&nbsp; I took a couple more small bumps. I couldn&#039;t focus very well, and when I was trying to pay attention to the professor I felt<br /><br />&nbsp;paranoid and it made me start shooting my eyes all around the room trying to avoid looking awkward or guilty.&nbsp; I ended up just leaving class 30mins early and I don&#039;t even think he noticed me walk out so I doubt he gave a damn about how I looked in class. I felt stupid for <br /><br />leaving early and missing the homework assignment so I started to head back but then I realized I could run home to do another line.&nbsp; Keywords: Run Home<br /><br />Even though I drove my car to class I still felt compelled to run the mile and a half back to my house, with a bag of books. I don&#039;t regret this decision one bit. Greatest run of my life. I weighed out the remainder of my back when I got home, and much to my dismay there was<br /><br />&nbsp;only 100mg left. Maybe those &quot;couple more small bumps&quot; were a bit larger than I originally thought.&nbsp; Oh well. I felt so great I swear I wondered why I even wanted to do more meth. I just did. <br /><br />I ran back to the local college and got my car and went to Mcdonalds to order a smoothie, milk, and a small fry. After forcing myself to consume the nutrients (not so enjoyable) I talked to everyone in the lobby for about 30 minutes. Had some great conversations with <br /><br />strangers. I&#039;m sure this would have freaked&nbsp; most people out but I live in a small town and i&#039;m generally considered handsome and everyone is so friendly. Damn. I love meth. Somehow I had smoked the rest of&nbsp; package of cigarettes, but I swear it seemed like I only smoked a<br /><br />&nbsp;couple while I was listening to music in my car. I chainsmoked for about an hour straight. I&#039;m a bit disgusted by this and next time I do meth i&#039;ll remind myself to calm down on that front.&nbsp; After I ate dinner I consumed a 25mg bump and planned to come here and work on my<br /><br />&nbsp;post count but I got lost browsing wikepedia for way too long.&nbsp; and i still feel way too damn good. greatest day of my life. <br /><br />Figured i&#039;d come and find somewhere to give this great vendor props for the professionalism. then I wanted to thank him kindly as a friend for introducing me to such an awesome time. I have a couple more orders from various vendors coming in so i&#039;m looking forward to writing more reviews :) I hope everyone has had as good of a past day as I have. OMG Sorry for the long winding post I really just dont know what to do with myself. Thanks for anyone who reads this all i HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend xinhai. BUY MORE METH lol but seriously...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				I&#039;m posting this on every thread related to meth and chaletla:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole story with my order:<br />Order marked in transit day after. I wait one week checking the mail, and nothing. I start sending messages to track it. I get a reply that it&#039;s going to be sent tomorrow (that&#039;s 9 days after marked in transit!). I gave the benefit of the doubt. Three days later I receive a bag of stuff that looks like ketamine tiny shards. THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER FINALIZE UPON RECEIPT. I smoked it and I guess if you&#039;re an idiot from a state like mine that doesn&#039;t know too much about tina maybe someone might&#039;ve thought &quot;thats what crystal must be like.&quot; So I reply that I better get the real stuff and I want it express for the utterly obnoxious wait time. Two days later I receive a package of 60% big ass beautiful shards. Awesome product. The other 40% was that same crap. But like a dummy I saw those gigantic beautiful shards and hit the finalize button. As a seller on the streets I figured I have a lot of people who just sniff so I&#039;ll give them that. Two of those people felt sick for two days. Personally after I accidentally mixed some with the big shards to smoke-test it, later in the day my hands, mouth, forehead, and forearms became pockmarked. I have no idea why this seller chose to fuck with me specifically given his amazing reviews and honestly a 5/5 level product. However I seen forum postings about people with less than 5 transactions getting this fake shit. So if you have less than five be REAL WEARY of this guys shit. So, Chaletla, I hope all the people with low stats that buy from you and never tried tina or just not too good with understanding what REAL meth is wake the fuck up and don&#039;t fall for your &quot;meth.&quot; If you want me to make this a 5/5 review, (and your product was 5/5) then send real shit and not in a ratio of real to fake. JUST REAL<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; Vendor got the message that I was one upset customer. He offered to resend the package, +weight, and express. The package arrived on time and was perhaps the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. GIGANTIC shards and beyond superb quality. My only advice to newbies or buyers with low stats is to message him before buying it and making sure that everything will be on point. Let him know you have heard about it happening to others and will not stand for it if it happens to you. <br /><br />Vendor told me that his packaging person was fired solely because of how I was treated as a customer. Chaletla takes customer satisfaction very seriously and I admire the tremendous effort he undertook to make my transaction satisfactory to me.

				I didn&#039;t listen to you RompingStomp and I decided to go with Chletla because he has so many 5/5&#039;s. I am currently regretting it. Right now I am still waiting to hear back from him on my order. You are right the shards are beautiful and next to impossible to know anything is different. It did not melt at a low temp such as MSM, nor did it get the water drops forming in the bowl, nor did it &quot;run&quot; from the flame, it vaporized at about same temp (upon further investigation it is a little higher temp but still have not been able to get exact temp) as good does and it&#039;s vapor cloud was thick and white just like the good. The effect is where I became suspicious. I could go directly to sleep and sleep though the night after only being awake for 8 hours off a full nights sleep. <br /><br />The effects are as follows:<br /><br />1. Smoke<br />2. Sweat intensely<br />3. Disoriented mild high<br />4. headache<br />5. Weakness<br />6. Sleep<br />I would be hungry too<br /><br />This is all in a 2 hour period and had the same effects every day when attempting to find a good shard. I hope all the 5/5 reviews are not people that do not know the real stuff from the fake.<br /><br />This stuff From what I can tell so far it is not meth at all. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have the equipment to confirm what it is made out of entirely before the time is up on the order. The crack back pattern, temp, effects the substance has and the melting temperature are why I can say without a doubt that it is for sure not Methamphetamine Hydrochloride.&nbsp; It appears to be some kind of Alkylbenzylamine. They are very close in melting temp so I need a controlled stable heat source to be more accurate.&nbsp; If I can confirm zero real product then I would lean towards this being N-isopropylbenzylamine as it is very difficult to get it to recrystallize with the good stuff.&nbsp; I would like to stress that it is possible that chaletla is not aware of this because of how close it is to the real deal. Based on the number of people having issues I think he knows something is up with it.&nbsp; I will keep everyone informed on how this goes. I intend on finding out what exactly this is. No one should have to go through this process or feel the way any of us have after this stuff. <br /><br />I really hope this is not on purpose to newbies because that seems to be the pattern I see!

				Same exact issues with his gear.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had been withholding his name when discussing my problems with his gear up till now, but now that I see others have haivng the same problems I&#039;ll chime in.&nbsp; <br /><br />I actually ordered twice, the first order was so horrible that I complained and got a replacement (crazy amount of unreacted ephedrine and fairly poor quality gear once that was eph was removed).&nbsp; With his high feedback, I figured I must have just gotten unlucky and ordered another ball on top of my free replacement.&nbsp; No ephedrine in there this time, just beautiful, gigantic shards that don&#039;t do shit when smoked or snorted.&nbsp; &nbsp;What effects are felt are negative, as described by OP.&nbsp; <br /><br />After a cold anhydrous acetone wash the remaining product was almost the same weight as pre-wash, ruling out MSM as a cutter.&nbsp; It cracks back quickly and fluidly, and without the telltale polkadots left by n-iso, so I&#039;m at a loss as to what is making it so awful.&nbsp; In my opionion, it&#039;s either that&nbsp; levomethamphetamine bullshit (vicks vaupour inhaler fake stuff) or it&#039;s just really poorly synthesized gear.&nbsp; &nbsp;Given that my first order contained a ridiculous-bordering-on-funny amount of unreacted ephedrine, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s the latter.&nbsp; Someone needs to go take a remedial organic chemistry class at their local community college and stop producing horrible meth in the meantime.<br /><br />I just posted in the Meth vendor&#039;s thread asking how people can think that is decent crystal...now that I thought to search his name on the forums and see others describing similar quality gear, I&#039;m even more confused.&nbsp; &nbsp; Is there a bag labeled &quot;new users&quot; and one labeled &quot;real customers&quot; with wildly differing levels of quality at casa de Chaletla, or are enough people really that stupid?<br />

				He fired a packing guy for my order refunded my coins and sent a &quot;sample&quot; of what should have went out. I waited on the review for the &quot;sample&quot;. This sample never showed up but showed as delivered. I have never had a lost or missing package ever until that but I figured shit happens. I didn&#039;t contact him again about the missing package because his profile said if it says its delivered then its delivered and went on to say he is not stupid. So I just reviewed the product I received. long story short I am now waiting on a sample again. If I am lucky I might actually get something real after a month of BS. I was wondering if it is worth trying others...<br /><br />HT - HammerTime<br /><br />Received .5 overweight solid stealth and he was fast to respond. I finalized on receipt. Have not tried much but I am not impressed at all with the quality so far. It has a lot of the same features/effects as Chaletla. Melts the same cracks the same but less msm blow off and has a chemical smell I cant place. He still has a 5/5 review from me pending a closer look at the gear. I don&#039;t expect pure. I have only had pure once and was limited to a small amount for a high price so my expectations are not real high on quality but I do know my real from not. <br /><br />Waiting on an order from The Dope Spot and UnlimitedLife. I should have checked the forum on unlimited before purchasing. I am going to sample every vendor not pegged as a scam and I hope to find one with some good gear I can stick with.<br /><br />Is it possible for a vendor to have multiple accounts?

				It sucks that I was able to write stuff in the real thread before but not anymore. Well, I&#039;ll be 1 post closer to be able to do it again.<br /><br />Ordered some ice from Dopatonin. <br /><br />Everything transaction wise was perfect. Stealth, shipping, weight. I&#039;m at about 15 transactions on SR and it was probably the best packaging ever. Almost overkill since it was a domestic order !!<br /><br />As for the stuff we&#039;re talking about the best shards I&#039;ve seen on SR. They are huges, no color, no odor. Delicious !! It smoke clean as hell leaving nothing in the pipe once you&#039;re done !

				I quit doing meth about 15 years ago. However, my experience is that Smoking rather than snorting it is the best method for not having all of your teeth fall out of your head. At least that is how the long timers (mostly self medicating people with Bi-Polar disorder), would manage their crystal.<br /><br />No judgement here, I&#039;ve done huge ass rails of the stuff and quit and I&#039;m okay. (Maybe a tooth missing here or there but nothing obvious)<br /><br />Just a word of advice is all.

				Meth is not what meth was a few years ago.&nbsp; Its just garbage nowadays&nbsp; And as each day passes the product just gets weaker and weaker.&nbsp; And the more middle men there are the more it becomes nothing but cutters. Meth is not meth anymore . It should be called Methitaintandcutteritismine.&nbsp;

				No teeth missing here. I&#039;m a functioning member of society. Some advice here is hygiene brush floss shit shower and shave. Take care of yourself and stay healthy. I did method 7 years ago frequently and just stopped one day. Now I dabble in it once or twice a year when I have free time.
