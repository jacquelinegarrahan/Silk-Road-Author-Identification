				<br />Appended the email I received from Bitinstant.&nbsp; I got home and thought everything was kosher and my cons were there.&nbsp; Also, it seems funny how they stopped accepting Mt.Gox with no reason given, then required all the registration bS with personal information.&nbsp; I guess them losing my money is the thanks I get.&nbsp; Anyone have similar experiences with them?<br /><br />From: support@bitinstant.comi<br /><br />To: XXXXX<br /><br />Subject: BitInstant Transaction Failed<br /><br />Hi XXXXXX<br /><br />Thank you for using BitInstant!<br /><br />This email is to notify you that while we received your payment successfully, we have encountered an error while trying to process your transaction at Jul 10 2013 12:42:30, meaning your order has currently failed.<br /><br />Transaction ID: xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx<br /><br />If you contact support about this transaction, please reference this number so we can help you more quickly.<br /><br />Your payment of 341.84, has NOT yet been transferred to virwox.<br /><br />Our customer support agents have been informed of this problem and are currently investigating the problem. An agent will be in touch with you shortly regarding your account and what the next steps are. Until we understand what the issue with your transaction is, we suggest that you avoid creating further orders at BitInstant.com (in case you have entered account numbers incorrectly).<br /><br />Again, we have automatically created a support ticket about this issue and you do not need to create one manually. We will contact you shortly to help resolve your issue.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience,<br /><br />The Bitinstant Team<br />

				I used to use bitinstant as my primary method of obtaining btc. <br /><br />But, with the recent changes to their EULA, I feel as if my anonymity has been lost to a greater extent. Also, they&#039;ve been having general problems processing payments even if one fully registers... try localbitcoins.com<br /><br />Best of luck!
