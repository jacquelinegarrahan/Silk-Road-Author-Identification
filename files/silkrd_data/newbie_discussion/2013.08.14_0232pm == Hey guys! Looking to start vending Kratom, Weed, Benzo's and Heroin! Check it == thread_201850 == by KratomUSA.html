				UPDATE!&nbsp; UPDATE!! UPDATE!!!<br /><br />We have decided that we will open our vendor account on Veterans Day 2013.&nbsp; So November 11th!&nbsp; We will have sample bundles with premium Kratom powdered leaf, clonazepam and pre-rolled joints!&nbsp; <br /><br />Please do not contact us here or on the marketplace for samples.&nbsp; We do not have a vendor account and refuse to do deals outside of the SR system.&nbsp; No exceptions! <br /><br />STAY TUNED FOR DEVELOPMENTS!<br /><br /><br />Hello folks!&nbsp; We are KratomUSA, and we are looking into starting a vending operation on Silk Road Marketplace during the fall months.&nbsp; We source only the finest powdered kratom leaf, and enhanced kratom leaf for legal, non-opiate pain management, management of opiate withdrawal and/or recreation.<br /><br />Along with our fine kratom products, we will also have listings for other non-opiate substances, most likely 1mg Clonazepam (Mylan brand, USA Pharmacy Fresh!), 1/8 ounces of indica dominate A+ - AAA+ Marijuana, various grades of Hashish and on occasion stamp bags of street grade #4 Heroin.&nbsp; We are currently looking into pure Dextromethorphan as well.<br /><br />All of our products go through a rigorous testing process before being passed onto the marketplace.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t meet our standards (Which are pretty high!), we woudn&#039;t think twice about holding back a listing until our supplier comes correct with the good shit.&nbsp; As well, all of our listings will be pre-packed for ease of shipping.&nbsp; All orders will be in the possession of USPS before being marked “in-transit”, we will be offering Priority shipping for all items.&nbsp; The only exception will be any opiate based listing, which will by default be shipped express.<br /><br />Of course, there are still some details that need to be ironed out.&nbsp; We will NOT open a vendor account until we have all of our stuff in a row.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what we need from you at this point, is to let us know what you think of our pending service and what you the customer thinks the demand would be for our service here on SR Marketplace.<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />KratomUSA

				Hey there soon to be vendor :) <br />I may only be a complete noob, although I have been lurking about sr for quite a while sussing out whom my first buy was going to be from.<br />Along with price of the product, my absolute biggest issue is STEALTH. Being an A-grade daddy&#039;s child (I&#039;m older than you&#039;re thinking lol, just can&#039;t stand the thought of my dad&#039;s face if i were to fuck up big time) it really means a lot to know that you, the vendor, is putting in all the effort you can in your packaging! <br />Having emailed a few vendors asking specifically about their packaging and getting the answer &quot;yeah it&#039;s good, had success to your country&quot; really put me off, so in the end I settled for someone with the words &quot;AMAZING STEALTH&quot; in every single comment :)<br /><br />Good luck to you!!

				Hello, Joplin!<br /><br />Now, most people would think that receiving Kratom in the mail doesn&#039;t require much stealth.&nbsp; Although this in practice is true, we plan to &quot;bundle&quot; the Kratom with other things that will absolutely need to be kept out of sight.&nbsp; On that note, we have no intentions of deviating from the Silk Road sellers guide.&nbsp; That includes packaging.&nbsp; We should also add that if/when this vendor account is opened, we will have a strict PGP/GPG policy.&nbsp; No unencrypted addresses.&nbsp; Back to the packaging ;)<br /><br />We intend on using the latest techniques in odor and noise reduction/elimination and exterior labeling.&nbsp; We will pack it like we would be getting it, and opening it mostly in front of possible condescending third parties.&nbsp; This is not a one man show, the ideas and general concept for this vendor account have been in the works for months.&nbsp; We are just putting things in place, then within 90 days from now we should be ready to roll.<br /><br />And for Psyche:<br /><br />http://www.sagewisdom.org/kratomguide.html<br /><br />That will give you the basics.&nbsp; We plan on posting general guidelines for recommended dosages with our listings, as our proprietary blends tend to be a bit stronger than the usual Kratom you find in Head Shops or even on Clearnet!.&nbsp; This stuff is on a whole &#039;nother level. Haven&#039;t tried PlutoPete, so I cannot comment on his products at this time.<br /><br />One member of the team here at KratomUSA, has experience with various opiates spanning over a decade and if they aren&#039;t pretty fucked up off 5-7 grams of our powdered leaf then it&#039;s not up to our standards.&nbsp; We have tried the one Kratom vendor here in the US, and we are confident in our blends, products, overall stealth and shipping that it won&#039;t be long before KratomUSA will be your #1 stop for your Kratom needs.<br /><br />Please do not ask about International shipping, as those logistics will, and cannot be in place until the vendor account is well established.<br /><br />Please do not ask us for samples at THIS time, or after the vendor account has been activated.&nbsp; When the vendor account is activated, we will have a half dozen sample packs to go out to trusted members of the forums for reviews.&nbsp; Have been here a while so I know who you good folks are and just about everyone who is a scamming cunt.&nbsp; <br /><br />To wrap this up.&nbsp; We have been discussing the possibility of offering Lotto Tickets of #4 powder Heroin once the vendor account has reached 100-150 sales.&nbsp; Strict rules will be in place for this type of offering, trust us when we say we will do everything in our power to make sure that these get into the right hands.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We are Very glad to see some interest.&nbsp; Post any questions you may have and we will do our best to answer you in a complete and timely fashion!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Thanks,<br />KratomUSA
