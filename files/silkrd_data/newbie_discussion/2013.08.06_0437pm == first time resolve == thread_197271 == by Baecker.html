				hi,<br /><br />for the fist time on silkroad i had some problems with a vendor. the produkt never arrived in the first 17 days and so i had to resolve and let it go to the resolution centre.<br />now my options are: get refund OR extend the due date by several days.<br />i contact the seller and he offers me to resend my order in the next few days.<br />my problem is, if i extend the due day by x days (hopefully to get it) and it doesent arrive one more time, is it still possible to get a refund or is this option no longer available after extening the due date?<br /><br />regrads, b√§cker<br />

				good luck. Dreamension has been screwing a bunch of us over for a month. Each time the resolution is about to expire, Dreamension sends a message saying he has now shipped the order with a big bonus........and silk road keeps extending the date.<br />I have been told my order has been shipped 3 times now, each time with an even bigger bonus, and of course he never ships it.<br /><br />I thought escrow was for pretty much these exact situations but all they do is keep extending the date. I have been asking for a full refund for over 2 weeks now and they just extend the date.<br />So all a vendor has to do is keep lying and say he has shipped the order the day before the resolution runs out and silk road extends the dat either by 7 or 10 days. So if u happen to not log in on the day it ends, they release the money and u are screwed.
