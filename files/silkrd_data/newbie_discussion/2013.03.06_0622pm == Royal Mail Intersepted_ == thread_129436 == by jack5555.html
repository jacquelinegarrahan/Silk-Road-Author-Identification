				Hi everyone. I&#039;ve ordered several stuff from this site in the last 2 months, everything always arrived next day after posting, but i ordered last week something which was sent out on 25th Feb, so 1st class arrives usually next day, but this item has still not arrived, the latest it should have arrived is 28th. What is the likelihood that it was intercepted by Royal Mail/Police or just lost? i&#039;ve never had a letter or package get lost, ever! <br /><br />Thanks for any help provided. I just want to add its UK-To-UK post and the the seller is trusted.

				Get proof of shipping, if no parcel arrives after 2 weeks then request some compensation if you do not get a seizure letter.

				royal mail don&#039;t inspect anything. worst case scenario it was ripped open in a sorting machine which revealed the contents or it was lost/stolen by someone who works for them. <br />i&#039;ve had domestic show up a month after i expected it, it&#039;s rare but it happens. royal mail does seem to have slowed down a lot recently so i wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much yet. if it&#039;s weed you&#039;re ordering i&#039;ll just say our 2 biggest uk vendors have had issues recently with one being ill which severely slowed down his turnaround and the other has been banned outright. <br />ignore magic man his advice is completely irrelevant to your situation.

				Thanks, appreciate that help. <br /><br />it was MXE i ordered. The seller offered to reship it if it doesn&#039;t arrive by Friday which i am happy about, was just worried if they had intercepted it that if a second package comes with this stuff in, it may be problems for me. <br /><br />Strange thing is one of my letters arrived open 2 days ago so was a bit confused...

				hmm that&#039;s weird a load of tunbears orders got nicked before christmas i&#039;m guessing by a thieving temp worker. i ordered some mxe for a friend which didn&#039;t show and he did do a reship after a while which showed up fine but he didn&#039;t ask for an address for the reship meaning he must have been storing them so i avoid him now... could be someone in the postal system his end is onto him and has profiled the packaging. completely forgot about that order given it wasn&#039;t for me!<br />did your open one have product or was it empty?<br />fair dos mduk they inspect and have dogs, i&#039;ll take your word for it! i can&#039;t imagine it&#039;s anywhere near the level of customs scrutiny and i&#039;d still say the likelihood of interception is a hell of a lot lower. i doubt they&#039;ve bothered training any dogs to sniff out mxe either. just hope if it&#039;s a thief that they think it&#039;s coke or something and get uncontrollably fucked up for a while as a result of their thievery ;)

As well as the handelers are expensive, and the RM staff are under-paid. <br /><br />So the chances of a dog catching your shit after it gets through customs is very, very slim. <br /><br />Now border customs is different. The actual place all the mail goes before it reaches a RoyalMail depot. I&#039;m sure they have dogs/x-rays but with all the packages coming in and out of the country every day, it&#039;s still hard for them to catch. <br /><br />You ever watched anything on TV where they go in to these kind of depots. You still only ever see them catching the ridiculous packages. Like the latest one I seen was 5000 pills in a book. The book had a whole cut in the middle, 5000 pills were stuffed in it (not vac sealed, just in a zip-lock) and it was wrapped in brown paper with an address on it. Not even a fucking box. <br /><br />I mean, what the fuck? How stupid are some people.

				yeah use your own name otherwise it looks really weird if a few things turn up every now and then to a different name and they&#039;re all jiffy packages and thick envelopes. if it is your postman and he&#039;s clocked on that&#039;s just like labeling them &#039;free drugs&#039; haha

				Thanks for the advice.<br /><br />Now im thinking he&#039;s most likely clocked it, and thinking he may open my packages too under my own name.<br /><br />I ordered some APB powder (legal high in the UK) from some website which usually comes in a thick jiffy type envelope, i&#039;ll see if i receive that, should receive it tomorrow as i&#039;ve always received my legal highs the next day after ordering them for the last year! if i don&#039;t receive them i may just be having words with this post guy! he looks like the type of guy who does drugs anyways!

				Posties are thieves! I get on with mine really well because we went to school together for a couple of years, and he has out right told me he has stolen festival tickets and envelopes where he knows there is cash in it. <br /><br />Because of the whole &#039;privacy&#039; thing with mail, if they are caught stealing they get a unbelievable sentence in jail, like 10 years or something!

As well as the handelers are expensive, and the RM staff are under-paid. <br /><br />So the chances of a dog catching your shit after it gets through customs is very, very slim. <br /><br />Now border customs is different. The actual place all the mail goes before it reaches a RoyalMail depot. I&#039;m sure they have dogs/x-rays but with all the packages coming in and out of the country every day, it&#039;s still hard for them to catch. <br /><br />You ever watched anything on TV where they go in to these kind of depots. You still only ever see them catching the ridiculous packages. Like the latest one I seen was 5000 pills in a book. The book had a whole cut in the middle, 5000 pills were stuffed in it (not vac sealed, just in a zip-lock) and it was wrapped in brown paper with an address on it. Not even a fucking box. <br /><br />I mean, what the fuck? How stupid are some people.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dogs are trained to detect multiple illicit substances. Just Google the subject...They will only detect explosives, or drugs because of their &quot;hitting&quot; response. I had a scare once flying from Madrid to Amsterdam via Germany. I had been in Ibiza for two weeks, so I obviously had been partying hard. And had been smoking a a lot of beat hash which I would toss in my backpack. I made sure to remove everything before I flew. But upon arriving in Germany a comando guy was sitting there with a very large German Shepard. I went to walk by the dog, but it followed me. The German cop yelled &quot;halt&quot;, good thing I know 3 words of German. Anyway, the dog waled around my lugage for&nbsp; 30 long seconds then walked away. That was the scariest moment of my life. I would have kicked myself if I forgot to remove a gram of hash or something stupid.
