				To anybody new to the road looking to get some buyer stats up quick so vendors will fuck with you be careful. Things like clothing and books and basically everything that would be cheap for LE to acquire and ship oould possibly be a trap to point their LE counterparts in other parts of the country in your direction. Ya know just to see if you are doing anything else that seems suspicious. (ordering t shirts from a very hard to stop,drug marketplace website is suspicious since you can buy them anywhere else like ebay or funnytshirts.com) Im not trying to knock any vendors t shirt or ebook sales ,all im saying is that if a vendor is only selling these items and has very little to no feedback,and doesnt sell any type of drug then please be very careful about shopping with them.

				Does anyone know the crime and punishment for buying legal items on SR since sales tax wouldn&#039;t be payed. Also, what information about the buyer in the vender able to see? Any previous items purchased or just stats like money spent?

				well if they&nbsp; wanted to be assholes then yes the sales tax.i think vendors can only see how many items you have bought and how much bitcoins were spent and how long you have been buying. but if someone has 10 transactions with 70 bitcoins spent then its somewhat obvious your buying more than a shirt. a cop could purchase a tshirt from somebody and just see if it was sent from the persons actuall address. just to see if they had other stuff going on. for me it is hard to trust a vendor who only sells things that can be bought from legal sites. however there are some vendors who have good long reps on sr with their legal products. those would be the only ones i ever purchase something like an ebook or a surv system from on sr.

				With SR and Bitcoins if it could be proven you used it, no one can proved who payed for what. Unless L.E. knows the addresses that you have used.<br /><br />Which I doubt they would. Stop being paranoid.

				No idea on the legality etc. of buying technically legal items through a service like SR, it did however seem like a fairly stupid means of gaining a rep on the site, surely a couple quid would be worth the kind of scamming you might be able to do once you&#039;d &#039;apparently&#039; established yourself. Though i do understand the need to offer something, however potentially ineffective. <br /><br />My suggestion is, Do your homework, message your chosen vendor and establish contact, don&#039;t try and take everyone&#039;s advice (its fucking impossible) but make sure you consider all the angles as what your are doing is illegal, and whilst there isn&#039;t much chance of physical violence, you do have a greater risk of being scammed and drawing the attention of LE via events entirely outside of your control.
