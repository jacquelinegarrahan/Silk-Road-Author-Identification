				&nbsp;;D ;D ;DHello Everyone....<br /><br />I have had a great introduction to SR.... However, I have a problem with one of the vendors here. I purchased an item from him on January 18, 2013. Paid extra for express shipping... Item was marked shipped on January 26, 2013. However, on January 24, 2013 I messaged him about my order and asked him if I need to cancel my order because of the delay. He reassured me everything was cool and it was shipped that day. I finalized the order on January 26, 2013. I still have not received my order...... :&#039;(<br /><br />Two days ago I messaged him expressing the fact that I still have not received my order and I wasn&#039;t pleased with his service. He rudely replied... &quot;then don&#039;t ever order from me again&quot; and that was it. I messaged him in return and asked what happened to my order and he hasnt replied. He doesnt ever have to worry about me ordering from him again ...<br />I am just hoping I was lied to about the shipping times and not scammed? I would have never FE if his reviews wasnt good and a &quot;respectful&quot; vendor. He has alot of orders and reviews on SR. Does anyone else have any experience with COCEZERO?????? Terrible customer service....<br /><br />BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help..... &gt;:(

				Why would you release the funds to him when you had not received his product?&nbsp; If you FE, bad shit usually follows.&nbsp; The vendor already has your money and with the amount of orders cocezero has he probably forgot all about you.

				I&#039;m having some problems with Cocezero as well. I&#039;ve had an account with SR for about 6 months but didn&#039;t have enough extra funds to buy anything until a few weeks ago. Cocezero&#039;s my second transaction and it doesn&#039;t look good. I&#039;m following the advice of more prominent members here, keeping it as polite as can be and giving him the benefit of the doubt but it&#039;s been going down hill.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t until after I placed my order I noticed the rumors about him spraying his weed (seems to be a lot of people claiming it). Then scams involving money orders. Reviews start popping up about bad quality and not receiving any product. <br /><br />I was going to FE as that seems to be what&#039;s expected of newbies here, but decided not to when it took 4 days to process my order. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t because it&#039;s been almost 2 weeks now, and he hasn&#039;t responded to my inquiries.<br /><br /><br />So... it looks like it hasn&#039;t taken long for me to develop a personal relationship with the resolution center... How does it look for me being only my second transaction?<br /><br /><br />On the bright side, TheILF&#039;s service was phenomenal, and made me a permanent buyer. If not for them Cocezero might&#039;ve scared me away.

				Splint, nobody is currently selling it on the road.&nbsp; If you would also buy some once it became available, copy and paste it into your sig!<br /><br />We do that to let chemists and people know that there is a demand for it here.

				I don&#039;t understand, is FE something that legit vendors regularly ask for? What good could possibly come of it?<br /><br />Seriously, if a more experienced buyer or vendor could chime in here, I&#039;d love to hear justifications for FE. I&#039;m genuinely curious.

				I&#039;ve got a pending order as well, but I decided to give him a few extra days for the benefit of the doubt, since I&#039;m not in a hurry and didn&#039;t FE.&nbsp; His latest profile message says: &quot;Re doing shipping and other safety futures(sic) will be back in 14 days.&quot; Hopefully he&#039;ll be able to come back and fulfill any pending orders. *crossing my fingers!* I really don&#039;t want to go down the &quot;Resolve for X%&quot; route.

				Well cocezero came through for me. He responded on saturday said to give a few more days and it just came in. Doesn&#039;t seem sprayed to me, I&#039;m happy. If you haven&#039;t gotten your package maybe he made a mistake; I&#039;d buy from him again.

				UPDATE:<br />Well.... was promised a refund 3 days ago. I have not received my order or a refund. Seller keeps reply with questions to my question concerning my zip code and then the next reply stated &quot;yes sure you can get a refund&quot;. The next message asked &quot;what did you order again?&quot; I copy and pasted my order history with him and sent a reply. I can not believe this guy... I ordered on January 18 people. <br />I have since order from another vendor and received in 3 days. What a major mistake dealing with this vendor! <br /><br />THE BIGGEST LESSON IN THIS IS TO NEVER FE EARLY..... NEVER..... EVEN IF THEY APPEAR TO BE LEGIT ACCORDING TO SR RULES. <br /><br />I read his feedback and see how many people he is conning with this FE. People need to read his NEW vendor profile..... it states &quot;buy at your own risk,&nbsp; no refunds.&quot; He is claiming he will not check tracking. <br />If they are respectable vendors they will not ask for FE....<br /><br />BEWARE...<br /><br />thank you

				I was using him for my first purchase, very attracted by the cheap deal he offered that is obviously too good to be true. He marked the package as in transit last last Monday (February 11th) which is sadly the same time that you guys were having problems with yours. I read the reviews, and since it was mostly good replies, I decided why not - even with the few &quot;never came got a refund&quot; reviews. I was anticipating it today, hoping to start my weekend with bud, but nothing! At this point I expected it so I messaged him yesterday and again today. I already couldn&#039;t believe it didn&#039;t come after one long week and president&#039;s weekend, especially since it&#039;s within the US. He hasn&#039;t replied yet. <br /><br />I have done some research, but does anyone else recommend anyone with similar prices as he does, but is more reliable? This guy&#039;s perfect for new buyers because we get attracted by the price so easily, and here I&#039;m hoping he doesn&#039;t take advantage of the fact that I&#039;m a new buyer and if he doesn&#039;t give me my package, then I could at least get a refund and go elsewhere. I didn&#039;t think much about the FE because not only was it free shipping, but he has reviews already, know what I&#039;m saying?<br /><br />I came to SR for convenience and the wide variety of choices. I expected a lot better from cocezero and was hoping he would be my new supplier. I am also upset about the rumors about him spraying his weed. Although I prefer to try it myself if it ever does arrive, I wish those rumors never came up in the first place. If it doesn&#039;t come on Monday and he doesn&#039;t reply by then, I will consider reporting him. Why keep a business up when this has been a frequent problem with people?<br /><br />Saddest part is that I have used some of my own money I could have saved with this deal to buy stuff for myself locally. Instead of buying that 8th I purchases around here, I could have just invested that money into getting something else.
