				Hello All,<br /><br />Long time follower of the road with many great transactions and amazing vendors encountered. I just wanted everyone to be aware that 47wille is not to be trusted as a BTC vendor. He cashed the MP and stated that he &quot;was unable to help me&quot; and promptly canceled my order. I just wanted to give a heads up to others since I cannot post in the rumor mill section. I hope karma is real...<br /><br />MZ<br />

				Please also make sure that you report him on SR ... there should be a link to report a listing (where you can still report that the vendor is a scammer).

				Hey,<br /><br />Thank you for the response. I have reported him twice thus far and not sure what else I can do? Or how fast SR responds? I just want to prevent other vendors this fate.<br /><br />MZ

				Also seemed to have been ripped off for quite a bit by 47Willie. He has good feedback and there was little reason to believe he was a scammer as there&#039;s only one negative feedback and it dates from this month. At any rate, it has been two weeks and he&#039;s fairly evasive with jumping in and out of stealth mode. We shall see...<br /><br />Will update if anything changes but thus far, no BTC for my cash.

				Just wanted to update that I&#039;ve still not received any communication or BTC from 47willie. I&#039;ve requested my funds back with myself paying the Western Union fees and he still remains elusive. I&#039;ve reported to SR multiple times but haven&#039;t heard anything from them. <br /><br />47willie described his organization to me as a legitimate currency exchange organization out of Atlanta. I would normally never consider such an action but I am asking if there is any degree of consensus with posting 47Willie&#039;s name under which he collects WU payments. He does not seem to use PGP when sending messages, thus is fairly sloppy anyway. <br /><br />In the case that he has multiple accounts, should I post his pickup name in the hopes of protecting other BTC buyers on SR? I use fake names with WU but I don&#039;t doubt the legitimacy of the name he&#039;s given me to send to.<br /><br />Seems fair to do so as buyers are probably out thousands in total with this clown, what do y&#039;all think?

				He was pretty elusive with me as well, however it was a smaller order for a few hundred and he did eventually send me the coin, just took three days.&nbsp; I am NOT vouching, just stating the experience.&nbsp; Although he was cordial I wouldnt do it again based on the forum and his sketchy activity.

				Also if any of you are angry and computer literate, I may have something for you.&nbsp; PM me if you want.&nbsp; Buyers need to stick together against bullshit like this.

				Would like to caution all BTC buyers from purchasing from vendor &quot;47willie&quot; who is a confirmed Western Union scammer.<br /><br />In the event that he is using other accounts now or in the future, please beware of sending to anyone named &quot;William Tomlinson&quot; out of Atlanta, GA,
