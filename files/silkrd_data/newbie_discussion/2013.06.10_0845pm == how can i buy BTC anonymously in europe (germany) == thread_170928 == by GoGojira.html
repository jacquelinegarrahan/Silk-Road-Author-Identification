				I&#039;m sure this question has been asked before but the search function has been an asshole the whole day.(clearly our definitions of &quot;a few seconds ago&quot; are different&nbsp; ;) )<br /><br />the best thing i could find was localbitcoins but the nearest option would still mean 2 hours of driving (one way) and the price is not exactly what i have in mind and buying them online isn&#039;t anonymous.<br /><br />does anybody know a safe way?<br /><br />thanks in advance

				naja, ein verifiziertes konto ist nicht gerade das was ich als anonym bezeichnen würde ;)<br /><br />ich benutze schon bitcoin.de aber ich würde gerne ein paar coins kaufen die sich nicht (ganz so einfach) zu mir zurückverfolgen lassen.

				Fly to the US and do a cash deposit for Blue Sky Traders. It&#039;s that or localbitcoins. I don&#039;t know of any other anonymous way than localbitcoins outside the US... You can also use someone&#039;s credit card (with their consent, or at least pay them back!) and buy them on bitstamp, they don&#039;t ask for any verification or ID.

				Well your coins are clean but there&#039;s still a record of you buying bitcoins and that&#039;s a little suspicious if you&#039;re not trading. If you want to go that route I recommend trading, you make money too (unless you fuck up), and you have a valid reason to have bitcoins. Buying them anonymously is still better though, you can try webmoney and other things like that, which you can buy as prepaid cards, to buy BTC on BTC-e. A prepaid credit card is good enough for bitstamp though.

				localbitcoins<br /><br />find a good vendor. buy some online &amp; send cash. start small. then increase slowly. prices are down... get some soon.<br /><br />yes... you might get screwed this way.... but privacy comes at a price.<br /><br />if you play it smart its a great way. you can meet up in person as well, but thats way too much trouble for me. rather loose 30 E or whatever.<br /><br />

				wow, you must be living quite in the middle of nowhere then ;)<br />but I agree to tree, its either the options in the usa or through localbitcoins. hopefully someone will offer some closer to your place, check regularly.<br />At least I found that option to be easiest and completely anonymous!

				&gt;&gt; wow, you must be living quite in the middle of nowhere then<br /><br />well... its not just finding and meeting up... <br />there is many aspects to it... like what phone number do you give to him in case somebody is late? your real number? use a pre paid one? OK.. how about the phone? get an extra phone too?.. OK.. when do you switch it on? What do you do with your other phone when having it....&nbsp; And Im just getting started.<br /><br />using a phone this way links it to you purchase and therefore to your btc account. which means you got to burn the phone right away when you want to be anonymous.... man.. think about nature too, dont waste phones...

				Why would you need to buy btc anonymously anyway? Buying, selling and owning them is perfectly legal in germany and, afaik, all EU countries.<br /><br />You can buy btc using a european bank transaction very easily (bitstamp perhaps), after which the only thing you have done is exchanged euros for btc, which is no crime at all.<br /><br />What you do with your btc next is entirely your business. You may transfer them from the exchange to a wallet on your pc, or to some online wallet, or directly to SR. Any of that is hard to prove. It is not like sending a banknote to someone with a serial number on it so that it can be proven that a banknote you once handled now turned up in a drug factory in god knows where.

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.

				Do you know this service Friendlyface?<br />Actually I saw a lot of posts exactly the same from you in other threads. And in addition to that no feedback at all. Wouldn&#039;t really trust that site until I find other reviews.
