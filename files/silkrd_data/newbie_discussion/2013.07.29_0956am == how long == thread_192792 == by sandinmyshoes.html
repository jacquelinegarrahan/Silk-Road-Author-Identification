				Yes, anatomy does take a little patience. I should know, I am studying to be a doctor. <br /><br />Anonymity on the other hand, is not guaranteed with the use of bitcoins... ever. Every transaction is logged and every coin is unique. So it can always be told that a coin that ends up in a drug dealers hands came from you if you gave it to them. The idea of the tumbler is to split up your coins and &#039;wash&#039; them through many many transactions so that it obscures the path. It never actually guarantees your anonymity. <br /><br />Ideally you would buy your coins anonymously (cash deposit at bank). <br /><br />The absolute best way with coins that are in a real name is to use a fogger and do it that way because they have a pool of bitcoins and will put your bitcoins in, and take the same amount ou, minus the fee <br />The fee is also randomly set between 1-3% on the most popular site so as to add further obscurity. <br /><br /><br />Really its all about weighing up risk and reward for both you and LE. You need to ask yourself how much effort would LE put in to find your coins and link them to you and your drugs. In most cases, its too much to matter unless you are moving serious quantities.

				bitcoinfog.com was the one I was talking about, but I&#039;m sure there are others. There is also talk that blockchain.info also emplys fogging to some extent, but apparently its not accessible without javascript which should be turned off when using tor. bitcoinfog.com sounds like the way to go. <br /><br />Personally though, when I weighed it up, I decided that sending from my personal RL account to SR was good enough for me, especially if you put a large amount in to SR at once and them use it over multiple transactions that are spread out. However this makes yo really susceptible to the worth of your bitcoins being eroded, so you have to weigh that in too.<br /><br />Just don&#039;t be stupid on the Road and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be fine.
