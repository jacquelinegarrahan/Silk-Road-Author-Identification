				Arrrghhhh.... This is the longest - in 34 purchases - I&#039;ve ever had to wait after my BTC were send to my wallet. It&#039;s tearing my apart. I&#039;m refreshing my account page every 5 minutes, as I was hoping to get my order send out today so I&#039;d receive it before the weekend... What&#039;s the longest you&#039;ve ever had to wait, after being told by your BTC service provider that your coins had been send? Let&#039;s make eachother feel better by sharing my-story-is-shittier-than-your-story, stories...&nbsp; :-\

				Hi, do you know that if you go to blockchain.info and put your BTC address in the search box, it&#039;ll tell you if it&#039;s unconfirmed or how many confirmations it has done. You need 6, in case you didn&#039;t know, and after 6 they should show in the target wallet. Magic
