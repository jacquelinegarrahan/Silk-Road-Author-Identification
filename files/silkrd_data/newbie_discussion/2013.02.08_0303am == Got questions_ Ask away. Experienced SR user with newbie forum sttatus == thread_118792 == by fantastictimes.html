				Hello all. <br /><br />SR is a special thing. My guess is that one of the reasons the admins made this newbie forum is to make sure that people know what they are doing before they get started. This will help ensure that a few don&#039;t fuck it up for all of us. Due to my low forum presence I am a newbie on the forums, but I assure you that I am not new to SR. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars buying on SR and I have sold tens of thousands of dollars worth of illicit substances on SR. If you have any questions to help you get started please ask. I will answer all reasonable questions to the best of my knowledge, <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />FT

				At what point exactly during a transaction, is it necessary to use the GPG encryption? I&#039;m about 78% sure of what I&#039;m doing with it as far as encrypting and decrypting.

This includes messages to and from sellers as well as when you submit the address to deliver the product to. Your public key you can give to anyone and everyone if you want (I put it with the message I send to sellers). The only thing people can do with your public key is encrypt messages that only you can decrypt.<br /><br />If you are waiting for bitcoins to arrive at an address from another it normally takes an hour but it has been known to take variable amounts of time so do not worry if it takes as long as a day or so.

				I want to know if I&#039;m being safe enough using TOR. I live in the US.<br /><br />I&#039;m just using the basic settings that come with the Tor browser.

If you&#039;re worried, connect to some bridges so your connections look like harmless non-tor connections. But overall you should be fine. LE normally goes after sellers more than buyers anyway. Just remember if LE does come knocking on your door, &quot;anyone can send anyone anything through the mail.&quot;

				I recommend keeping anything related to Silk Road in a truecrypt encrypted volume but especially as a seller. It allows you to do things like keep proper accounting and track your top customers without worrying about incriminating them or yourself. If you ask me, the underworld hasn&#039;t had enough proper book keeping since they realized they could pop Al Capone for tax evasion. Lol.

No, you don&#039;t. Just make sure you read vendor&#039;s page before placing the order. Some will ask you to FE if you don&#039;t meet certain criteria. Make sure you research vendors on forums as well, not only from SR feedback. It can be faked using multiple dummy accounts.<br /><br />2. No, unless you can make sure it&#039;s not tied to you in any way. If you get busted using PO box you opened using a fake ID this will probably be the heavier of two charges (if you buy for personal use)

				all these questions have been answered a hundred times before. use the search function from the main page not the newbie section. <br />if you&#039;re asking about how to get BTC then it&#039;s useless if you don&#039;t say which country you want to buy from. <br />USA like bitinstant a lot. UK like pingit&gt;blockchain as there&#039;s not many options<br />be very wary of the BTC vendors on here they may not be the most trustworthy even if you do feel more anonymous using them. make sure to avoid anyone using paypal as a payment option. they are too stupid to trust with your money.

My guess is that one of the reasons the admins made this newbie forum is to make sure that people know what they are doing before they get started. This will help ensure that a few don&#039;t fuck it up for all of us. Due to my low forum presence I am a newbie on the forums, but I assure you that I am not new to SR. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars buying on SR and I have sold tens of thousands of dollars worth of illicit substances on SR. If you have any questions to help you get started please ask. I will answer all reasonable questions to the best of my knowledge, <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />FT<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hello FT, first off let me thank you by making this thread because if it&#039;s anybody I love to ask questions it&#039;s somebody who is experienced in what I am asking !<br />Unfortunately I can&#039;t get BTC from MtGox, the site I was originally going to use because I&#039;m not comfortable with how much information they require. Do you suggest any good alternatives?<br />Thanks!
