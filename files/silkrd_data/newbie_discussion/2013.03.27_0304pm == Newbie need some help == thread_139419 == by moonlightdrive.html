				It&#039;s for added security, alot of people use a coin mixing service or send they&#039;re coins through a couple non SR bitcoin wallets before depositing to SR. It&#039;s for extra anonymity.

				quest 1- yes, that is your sr wallet.<br />quest 2- once your order is processed you will see a button that says finalize, thats how you FE. however, i would not FE. that how you get screwed. you can find vendors that will not force you to FE for your first orders. I would suggest you look into them. <br /><br />as far as using another site and then transferring to sr, if you&#039;re using fake info in the first place it doesn&#039;t matter. either way, it doesnt really matter. lots of people argue that &quot;washing&quot; or &quot;mixing&quot; coins is a waste of time and money.&nbsp; do as you please, but if you purchase the coins with completely fake info, then it doesnt matter anyways if it goes directly into your sr account, its already anonymous. hope that helps, and if you FE and never get your order, dont say I didn&#039;t warn you
