				Preface: MDPV is not dangerous if to invest in a $900-$1200 used 100 gram max 500 nano-gram minimum pharmaceutical&nbsp; OSHA/EPA certified druggist titration scale [your life depends on it, this goes for you 2c-* users too] <br /><br />I have access to even 1000 kilogram drums of 99.98% Dextroamphetamine HCl containers yet I use MDPV, Why? Well one costs upper 6 figures, the other costs roughly 6 month supply for a three digit figure. Granted, one is studied and MDPV could one way be more carcinogenic than asbestos. <br /><br /><br />I began using obscure imbiber of ethanol [booze] unscheduled FDA sidestepped &quot;research chemicals&quot; since 4-5 summers ago. Out of respect for those who sold to me I&#039;ll take the libertarian view of shielding info that could aid law enforcement. changing names, certain details that cold lead back to oft-reluctant persons who assumed I was 14, 15, 16 (I was the age of majority. anyone could signup, but nobody indexed any content on Google]<br /><br />I&#039;ve used 2C-E insufflated in idiotic levels [don&#039;t do that]. Yet I managed to hold to my center, and its made me a better person, despite being almost traumatic, Pro-tip, it inflames your nasal membranes quite painfully. Note.. don&#039;t do this esp if its your time time. Take it orally. not one visual. Though auditory hallucinations occurred. Arm yourself with this information.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also used the oft-demonized psycho-stimulant MDPV on a dally bases due to my lifestyle. Not even compound pharmacy 100mg Dexedrine IR tablets [I though that dose doesn&#039;t exist anymore] could touch MDPV for _my_ body. YMMV. Is Dexedrine healthier than MDPV? No doubt in my min I&#039;ve used MDPV daily for 2 years with just 3 unhealthy paranoia in that time. Dangerous? Aye. Overdose on MDPV and you go into this deviant paranoid state [controlled with benzos if allergic to benz.. barbiturates. <br /><br />I&#039;ve used Dextroamphetamine, mixed levo-dextro-amphetamine, the assorted synthetic cocaine [Ritalin[ [Concerta].<br />As well as a kid I used Phenylpropanolamine [PPA - Dexatrim], Buproprion [beta ketone stimulant in the same family as MDPV] The government, some pencil pusher with zero medical experience who works as an ASAC at a regioal DEA office told me I was a drug seeking patient with potential criminal history, and no doctor ever even looked at my name again . Just try to get this Scarlett letter expunged, and the crime of throwing it away&nbsp; can make the rest of your life inside a key-less zirconium-titanium polymer iron maiden, designed to minimize risk of death, but maximize level 10 pain 24/7/365.. well that will be the tactics used by the D.A.R.E. to clean or kill all addicts program eventually. Perhaps an injection of fentanyl during prison followed by Naltrexone 24 hour continuous drip to send one into a endless cycle of precipitated withdrawal and a nanosecond of Level 9.95 pain vs level 10 pain for 23 hours a day in ADX Super-max in Colorado -- where they have a cell block designed not to keep records about how it punishes its inmates -- because we all know that inflicting sadistic suffering on those we see as evil is a logical thing.<br /><br />MDPV is a super potent drug, no doubt, but its double-digit figures cheaper than both Schedule II and Schedule I amphetamines [unless you are rich with a beautiful doctor who orders 1 litre bottles of 280mg/mL mixed amphetamine sales [a popular product for compounding pharmacies with doctors not afraid to tittrate 20-30 year tolerances to as high as 25 gram tinctures in 2 litre bottles manufactured by compounding pharmacies for five-figures for 2 months worth, and for custom Desoxyn [25, 50, 75, 100mg of Methamphetamine HCl IR, and 250mg, 300, 350mg, 500mg XR tablets sometimes combined with delayed release Triazolam and Oxazepam and 180 2gb Xanax for breakthrough insomnia<br /><br />I&#039;m lucky to always stay in my room when using any drug, let alone the jumpiness, delusions thought woring about. I consider myself damn lucky to use MDPV in amounts that allow me t remind to sanity. <br /><br /><br /><br />MDPV* can cause serious fatal outcomes due to massive increase in hypothermia, an being deceptive to YOURSELF about it will have consequences. <br /><br />I was offered samples that exhibit the fight-or=flight instinct [often resulting to PTSD-- hopfully MDMA will fix this. which is showing promise as a one-pill-forever-cured cure the the painful PTSD. Many persons with PTSD is going to be needed psychiatric treatment to to cope.<br /><br />My first use of hallucinogens was grinding up Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seads, crushed elctronically, and consume. The vasosconstriction combined with the lack of visuals, though I gelt this alient anergy in my occasionally.<br /><br />It was by far my most potent drug experience. But bummed me out that I am not capable of hallucinating except once when I was 6 and had frank [I no longer can process whether these are real or not] and I had a HORRIBLE fever. <br /><br />From a liquid LSD-25 300mcg/mL bottle [total volume not disclosed to protect the person still selling them. I shared a dozen or do strong doses wih others who&nbsp; had among other things, atheist shifting to agnostics, agnostics adopting non-Bush syle jueo-chistian rules. I took 300 micrograms others took 130MCG. They tripped balls as it where. I felt neutral skin sensations an flashbacks to random omens in the past that were not. Visuals? NOTHING. But... it was a mindblowing experience. <br /><br />Now finally, why do I use MDPV?&nbsp; Its seldom recreational,,, and often causes paranoia but it keeps me productive and is cheaper than dirt due to 95,000+ kilos being available and 1,000 kilos being demanded... Look up basic economics. Paranoid over irrational thing is a crappy price to pay for it and many psycho-stimulants bring out anxiety. I hide it well so that others don;t needlessly worry. But I can function rather than sleep. <br /><br />I make sure to eat protein and I sometimes forego my MDPV dose to be able to eat something without gagging. And never more than 48 hours without sleep... so far I&#039;ve been saved from psychosis... just paranoia. <br />Thanks for reading
