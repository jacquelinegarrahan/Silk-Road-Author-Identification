				No, really, I will. Someone help a &quot;Small Timer&quot; into the game.<br /><br />Im low on cash and cant afford a vendor account. Shrooms are cheap to grow, and I have a bunch on hand right now. When it comes to growing, I can hold my own.<br /><br />Heres the deal I propose:<br /><br />I take a pic of 3 oz of dried Psiliocybe Cubensis Mushrooms with your name or any other identifying characteristics. Once you receive that pic you buy a vendor account (with the name I request, not this account). You retain the password to provide a personal escrow. Then I check the site to see that the account does in fact exist. Once Im satisfied that the account is in fact real, I ship a package to you. Ill include a tracking number and stealthy packaging. In effect, you would be my first customer. Once you recieve the package, you would release the password to me, and I would subsequently change that password.<br /><br />Any takers can email me directly for my PGP key at my anonymous and never clearnet accessed account [REDACTED], I use that account as my relay and will reply via my secure email address.

				How will you afford the xxx$ for a proper commercial and up to date vacuum sealer? Shipping arrangements? Im not even naming the dozens of other startup costs that are necessary. 500$ is not much in the scheme of things and if you cant afford that, you shouldn&#039;t be starting such an endeavor. For yours and our safety.

				No vacuum sealer needed for mushrooms. I already have a sealer, and I use mylar bags exclusively. My stealth is already figured out as well. <br /><br />Product is already on hand. <br /><br />Im living paycheck to paycheck right now, and $500 for start up is a decent chunk of change ATM. Ive got everything I need to grow, package and ship. Im not looking to be a start up grower, only a start up vendor. <br /><br />Anyone willing to lend a hand to a new kid?

				For someone to consider this kind of offer you need to be more generous. 3oz is not even $500 at SR market price. Good luck.

				I&#039;ve seen some fucked up propositions made on this forum but I have to say, this just might work. I do agree that you may have to sweeten the deal a bit because nobody has had you product and the quality might not be what you think it is.

				You&#039;re going to have to double your offer I&#039;m guessing. Just the time, effort and risk of setting up the account etc. is probably worth more than that for most folks. It would suck to somehow get stuck with a vendor account you didn&#039;t want with a name you can&#039;t change, and not be able to get the bond back. Good luck re-selling that! I could be wrong on this, but good luck either way!

				It takes more than just having a bit of product to be a vendor here. the whole point of paid vendor accounts was to try and put a bar on who started selling here. Thus forcing people to work to drum up the cash resulting the resourceful and determined prevailing and the ones with no get up and go always just stuck with just the dream. That said I´m being a hypoctitical asshole sort of.. As way back when, I was you sort of, I had just done a run to morroco, eaten almost a kilo of hash and just got back, I had some amazing ideas but spunked all my cash on the journey there and buying the hash. The difference is I could have waited to shift some of that hash face to face to make the vendor fee, in fact that was my plan I was counting down the days, getting all of my profile written up in notepad lol, thinking about all the different message templates I would use, all my adverts, shipping methods, buying the small bits like the vac packer, plastic, mailers, scouting all the post offices, post boxes, calculating runs and drop points&nbsp; etc.. lol I was well into it, planning every fucking detail, it was my dream lol, it still is, i went to sleep thinking about it and woke up the same, I dont think I thought of anything else, even broke up with my then gf cause of it... SO I started selling face to face like usual, had half the fee up (this was like 3 days after it went from like 50 bucks to 500, was sooooooooooo gutted), then a guy called the captain (captainmal) took an interest in me (then a really fucking good vendor, wonder what happened to him.. I think he became a mod, anyway he just gave me the money, lol literally was like here and gave me the lot. Thats the day i figured this place wasnt like the rest of the world at all.. Anyways fast forward 8 months later, people are saying were one of the best hash n opium vendors on this long road. SO I guess maby bets do pay off on people who acn´t quite scrape it all up. WHoooooooo knows, dunno why i wrote all this.. Probably cause I´m really high on opium. Mnnn ACE

				Im glad you can sympathize with my situation. And Im hoping for a similar opportunity. Thing is, I have no intentions of going really big time here. I only hope to supplement my income, and run a small &quot;mom and pop&quot; outfit. <br /><br />While some may scoff at the vendor fee, for a lot of us that $500 can be a gateway to financial relief. Who knows, maybe people wont like my product. Maybe it wont sell at all. Maybe Ill gather a following and do well. There&#039;s no telling how it will go unless I try it. Im giving it a shot.<br /><br />Reality is that I grow mushrooms. Mush growers dont really sell product. They sell risk. The materials are dirt cheap(Literally). But the skill to grow takes a bit of study and experience, not everyone can do it.

				You are not allowed to sell anything from this forum without a vendor account.&nbsp; This is your only warning.&nbsp; If the start up fee is too much I suggest you look elsewhere to sell your items.&nbsp;
