				As I haven&#039;t vended before I can&#039;t tell you with absolute certianty whether they can go back indefinitely and see, but if it was recent feedback they seem to know.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a number of esteemed vendors comment that specific buyers have left feedback that was incorrect and explained the situation in their own terms.<br /><br />there are two possibilities I can see for why this could be the case.&nbsp; <br /><br />1 is that they can in fact see the feedback left by individuals for a short period.&nbsp; similar to how if you go into your account settings you can see recent feedback you&#039;ve left. what you purchased, and from whom.<br /><br />2 is that if they haven&#039;t gotten EXTREME amounts of orders they could deduce the person that left the feedback based on when they ordered, communications they&#039;ve had, when the DCN says it arrived. how far away the customer&#039;s location is, transaction ID, or simply noticing when 1 of their orders disappeared from their &#039;orders&#039; tab and when the money appeared in their account.<br /><br />Did this answer your question?

				I am familiar with windows pgp, but i haven&#039;t worked on a mac.&nbsp; TBH, i think we might be able to puzzle it out between us.&nbsp; So you can unencrypt a message, but not encrypt one? <br /><br />is gpgtool the name of the program or software you are using?<br /><br />btw, I posted in the other thread, but that one is likely to get clogged up or lost, just go ahead and reply here.

				thanks,<br />idd gpgtools is name of the program.<br />i read there a good tuto : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96799.msg686510#msg686510&nbsp; <br />so i know how it works, but it does not. I dont understand why it only works less than half time (and maybe the first when the computer is on),<br />I got, like i said, this error message : &quot; service &quot;openpgp : &quot;encrypt&quot; can&#039;t be use because the application did not respond to service demand. Try to open again &quot;(null)&quot; or contact the editor to get an update&quot;&nbsp; (encrypt or decrypt or anything else i tried..)<br /><br />I already uninstall .. don&#039;t know what to do ...

				Is there a possibility that you&#039;ve done any of the steps differently and didn&#039;t notice doing so in the cases where it does/doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think i wrote that very clearly.. hmmm.&nbsp; Have you tried doing it step by step EXACTLY the same to the same person with the same public key multiple times where it sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#039;t?&nbsp; I still don&#039;t think that question was very clear.&nbsp; If necessary I can attempt to write it more simply. haha. I guess my point with this is to try it a few times exactly the same with the same public key and see if it works sometimes and not others.&nbsp; alternatively I can send you my public key so you can attempt to send encrypt a message to me.<br /><br />The other thing i figured I&#039;d mention is in windows you have to save the text file as &quot;xyz.PGP&quot; before you can import it as a key.&nbsp; it appears that in MAC they want you to save it as &quot;xyz.ASC&quot;?&nbsp; you might want to give that a shot both ways.<br /><br />Hey, I also found on their website that these are the requirements to encrypt:<br /><br />&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; a secret key matching the mail address you want to write from (see Mail.app &gt;Settings &gt; Accounts)<br />&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; the public key of the recipient<br />&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; recipients and senders mail address have to perfectly match the mail addresses in the keys being used<br /><br />If one of those requirements is broken you won&#039;t be able to encrypt any mail.<br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t help I&#039;d recommend taking a second look over the info on here(additional links at bottom of page):<br /><br />[CLEARNET WARNING]: http://support.gpgtools.org/kb/how-to/your-first-encrypted-mail and http://support.gpgtools.org/kb/how-to/first-steps-where-do-i-start-where-do-i-begin

				When you post in a thread(topic) it goes back and loads the subforum(newbie discussion in this case) so you can see all the other threads there.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why, but that&#039;s how it&#039;s been since the forum first came online.&nbsp; If you hit back(alt+&lt;) it&#039;ll take you back to the thread you were in.&nbsp; If it isn&#039;t updated you might have to hit F5 to reload the page, or if it still doesn&#039;t show the changes(your post), you&#039;ll have to hit ctrl+F5 to reload the page where it will show any changes.&nbsp; If you computer is as dumb as mine you have to hit ctrl+F5 everytime you reload a page that you&#039;ve been to before in that session.<br /><br />Sorry. I&#039;m super exhausted and I&#039;m gonna go to sleep.&nbsp; Post back here if you can&#039;t find the address for tormail and when i get back online i&#039;ll find it for you.&nbsp; It&#039;s on the main forum in many locations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, the search function of our forums is AMAZING, but you have to make sure to be on the main &#039;silk road forum&#039; page where you can see everything from silk road discussion to rumor mill to newbie discussion to search the entire forum.&nbsp; If you just search from the &#039;newbie discussion&#039; section, it will only show results from the newbie section.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t figure this out for quite a while and it made me think i was going insane because i was sure i had seen a thread and then it seemingly wouldn&#039;t exist anymore.&nbsp; haha<br /><br />Till later.&nbsp; God Bless.

				No, I am 99% sure the captcha does not go away after you have reached 50 posts! I think its a great tool to help weed out the spammers, among im sure other things. They really are not hard to read they just contain letters, it would probably be better if they used letters and numbers, not sure though. It is an extra step but very benificial!

I&#039;ll let you know. :)<br /><br />CAPTCHA PROBLEM: If you keep getting the captcha&#039;s wrong, make sure you&#039;re only trying to enter LETTERS.&nbsp; I kept trying to enter a 9 when I saw a weird or distorted g and then i read the instructions: &quot;Type the LETTERS shown in the picture&quot; Doh!&nbsp; that confused me for a bit too!<br /><br />vxn: Yes, the vendors have the ability to hedge their purchases or not.&nbsp; Most vendors hedge them so they don&#039;t lose money because if someone doesn&#039;t finalize for 17 days that&#039;s a long time in a very volatile currency.&nbsp; However, with the way btc have been going in the past day or two they would have stood to make a lot of money had they not hedged it. :)<br /><br />Windmillz(x2): Ha, you just mentioned what i did about the captchas. haha didn&#039;t read that.<br /><br />SadUare:&nbsp; It depends.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in germany, that wouldn&#039;t surprise me that it&#039;s taking so long.&nbsp; I could see it taking that long in the UK too since the recent postal strike.&nbsp; Honestly, I&#039;d check the vendor page and see how long the estimated delivery time is.&nbsp; Then contact the vendor IN A VERY POLITE FASHION and see what their thoughts are on the matter.&nbsp; They probably have delivery confirmation on it if it&#039;s for very much money and they&#039;ll be able to confirm or not that it&#039;s arrived.<br /><br />One way or another PUT THAT ORDER IN THE RESOLUTION CENTER.&nbsp; The resolution center isn&#039;t just for getting a refund.&nbsp; It&#039;s there to protect you in a number of ways.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t put it in the resolution center it will AF(Auto Finalize) and that will automatically give your funds to the vendor, but it will also but a black scar on your purchasing history.&nbsp; You have two options in the resolution center: Request a Refund, and Extend Due date.&nbsp; Depending on you circumstances and what the vendor says, I&#039;d definitely put it in the resolution center now(in case you can&#039;t log on in a day or two) and extend the due date.&nbsp; Then clearly and concisely explain the circumstances AGAIN in the resolution center communications.&nbsp; <br /><br />TBH, that&#039;s a LONG time to wait domestic and I&#039;d ask for a reship.&nbsp; a FULL reship if they don&#039;t have dcn to prove whether it showed up.&nbsp; You CAN take a refund, but that will also put a black scar on your purchasing history and that&#039;ll be hard to overcome with a newer account and fewer purchases.&nbsp; Unfortunately a number of vendors take the opportunity to scam new accounts because they can get away with it and just say that the account was some random scammer who&#039;s been here before and opened a new account for the purpose of scamming.&nbsp; Sorry for the run on sentance.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll be on for a bit, any other questions?<br /><br />

				Barbie: It depends on whether they send it directly from their SR account to yours, or from a separate bitcoin address to the address in your account.&nbsp; If it was someone on the forums chances are they sent it directly from their account to yours via entering your account name.&nbsp; You can view the history of this by clicking the &#039;account&#039; link on the top of the page and then clicking the &#039;account history&#039; on the right side of the page. you can see what transfers were made into your account and from whom.&nbsp; If it&#039;s from a btc address you can send it back by copying the address into the space for that in the &#039;account&#039; page or if it&#039;s a direct transfer, just select their username and paste that into the corresponding box in the account page.&nbsp; keep in mind when you are selecting a quantity or amount to send it is in btc so 1.0 btc would currently send ~$15.60.<br /><br />skulldrag is correct, DO NOT finalize early. I have only once and I DID receive my product, however within the weeks that followed the vendor that I FE&#039;d for scammed more than $100,000 from members here. That scared the living crap out of me and I&#039;ve refused to FE ever since.&nbsp; It&#039;s also worth mentioning that even SR staff says they will not help you get your money back if you finalize before receiving your product and verifying it.

Is there an easier way to access forums and discussion?<br />2. I have no knowledge of how encryption works and not even sure if I should be encrypting this message. Should I be encrypting this message?<br />3. What are the pros and cons of using a library computer? My local library has a tech center with 80 computers than run on 2002 windows XP. I have no problem downloading and using the TOR browser and accessing SR. Since I have to use my library card # and a PIN to use the computer, would this be considered unsafe? note: there are surveillance cameras too.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />maxieB<br /><br />

				1) One of the easiest ways is copy and paste this url(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion) in the address bar, then click and hold on the tab that opens. Drag it to the spot right next to the &#039;Are you using tor?&#039; button on your toolbar right under the address bar and let go.&nbsp; When you want to come to the forums, click that link.<br /><br />2) Don&#039;t bother encrypting messages that don&#039;t contain sensitive data. A good way to determine sensitive data other than your address and whatnot is to ask yourself before you post if any of the information could be used to profile you or narrow you down out of the general populace.&nbsp; There are a number of great threads around on using pgp encryption.&nbsp; I would advise you to navigate to the security subforum located here(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=3.0) and then use the search bar on the top right corner of the page to locate some guides.&nbsp; It will be good practice for you. <br /><br />As a rule you should search the forums before asking questions, but if you&#039;re really stumped it&#039;s better to ask than to risk security breaches. In this case I offered to answer questions so I&#039;m not in the least concerned.&nbsp; The only reason I mention it is the incredible amount of questions asked over and over since nobody takes the time to try and search first.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you still have issues post again and I&#039;ll help you out.<br /><br />3) I&#039;d say there honestly aren&#039;t many pros.&nbsp; maybe if you don&#039;t have your own computer?&nbsp; The cons are numerous.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t supposed to load any software on the library computers, I don&#039;t know how you would run your encryption software, People would see what you&#039;re doing, You&#039;re on camera, many library&#039;s have the ability to monitor what you&#039;re doing on the computers, the library account you would be using would be linked to you, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;d seriously recommend looking into getting a secure thumbdrive and loading on that on your computer or you friend&#039;s if you don&#039;t have one. once again you can find tutorials in the security subforum using the search function. Make sure to be in the security forum when you search as the search only looks in the area of the forum you are already in. <br /><br />Once again if you have issues with this post again and I&#039;ll give you more direct .

				Hi,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I am a newbie, my first post, and I do have some questions for you. Thank-you ahead of time for your offer to answer questions. I have spent a small portion each day learning about TOR,SR, Bitcoins etc. And now I have learned I need to use a gpg program. Does everyone who does business on SR use a gpg program even though TOR tumbles addresses and Bitcoin exchanges protect anonymity? I think SR is a great website to cater to those who resent government rules. In the past they have stopped packages crossing the border and I never received the meds I ordered, just a nasty letter. and it scared the crap out of me, that was about 3 years ago and I am only going to order in the USA so nothing has to go through customs.&nbsp; So I am very glad to have found this site, and am hoping it is very secure.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So I understand this much so far about gpg&#039;s= plain text-encrypted text-cypher text-decrypted text-plain text. I learned that by reading the Gp4win information. I downloaded their Gp4win2.1.1Beta software. And I am supposed to test it at their site which I still need to do, I don&#039;t really understand how to. I don&#039;t see how SR uses it when you just put what you want into your shopping cart, then finalize payment with Bitcoins? Can you give me a simple explanation? And maybe explain where gpg&#039;s come into play? It maybe a day before I reply back as reading everything and trying to understand is a bit overwhelming. thank-you again<br />&nbsp;

				GPG is a way of covering your tracks. Do you have to use it? Well ... do you want to put your privacy in the hands of someone else, or do you want to take responsibility for your own privacy? If everyone does their bit and takes responsibility for their own privacy, then we are half way there to keeping ourselves and others half way secure :) <br /><br />Download GPG tools. Im not an expert on the topic, i learned all i need to know through the posts on the main part of the forums. <br /><br />this ... http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />this... http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html<br /><br />this ... https://www.gpgtools.org/<br /><br />this ... http://support.gpgtools.org/discussions/everything/4164-help-sending-my-first-encrypted-email<br /><br />and a very important one is this ... http://support.gpgtools.org/discussions/everything/3267-creating-pastable-encrypted-text<br /><br />Encryption is invaluable, learn it and use it!

				Skulldrag:&nbsp; That&#039;s super cool of you. +1.<br /><br />MumboJumbo: I don&#039;t think domestic packages are seized very often.&nbsp; I suppose if it was something stinky like bud and not vacuum sealed or packaged very well it&#039;d could stand a decent chance of being detected.&nbsp; I think that most of our vendors are very competent though and that it shouldn&#039;t be a very high concern when considering an order.&nbsp; <br /><br />If a package was seized I can think of 2 possibilities.&nbsp; Depending on what in particular was in the package and what quantity you&#039;d likely either get a love letter(from the govt), a controlled delivery, or MAYBE if it&#039;s just a gram of bud or something the package will just just be disposed of.<br /><br />Gardener: Np.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you&#039;ve spent your time researching.&nbsp; that shows you want to go about this in a manner that&#039;s shrewd and cautious.&nbsp; I applaud that. I also appreciate doing your own research before asking for help. :)&nbsp; Read through MumboJumbo&#039;s links. :) Most people use pgp encryption.&nbsp; It is definitely a necessity in my opinion.&nbsp; The difference is that even using btc and tumbles them, unless the person in question is a big player vending a lot of product, and even then, it&#039;s probably not worth the governments effort to try and discover who that person(s) identities.&nbsp; The cost in resources would be enourmous. <br /><br />However, SR is still high on the govt&#039;s radar and if the server were ever to be compromised if you didn&#039;t uncrypt your address when you sent it to the vendor and they hadn&#039;t marked the order in transit, they&#039;d be able to see your address. make sense?<br /><br />Also, the longer you&#039;re here you&#039;ll see that not everybody share&#039;s your sentiments about the SR.&nbsp; In some peoples eye&#039;s it&#039;s just a place to score droogs.&nbsp; other&#039;s have the same ideals as DPR, some have radically different ideas still.&nbsp; Just like great nations and communities in the world, we&#039;re made up of all different kinds of people. :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually had great success ordering from overseas to the US.&nbsp; Never had a single order go missing.&nbsp; Did have to wait quite a while for one though.<br /><br />gpg4win is good software.&nbsp; It&#039;s the software that is used to encrypt text communication.&nbsp; The way it works is that when you place an order with your vendor, you pay them in btc, but you also have to put your address in so they can send you your order.&nbsp; You don&#039;t just want to send it plain text because if the server ever was compromised it could be read.&nbsp; You enter the software, type your address in the clipboard, click encrypt, select your vendor&#039;s public key, and click ok.&nbsp; Then you copy the encrypted message into the address field.&nbsp; Only the person with the private key attached to that code and who knows the password for said code is able decrypt the message.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d also search the security subforum for some more in depth tutorials for it and read the buyer&#039;s guide located here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/buyers_guide<br /><br />If you still struggle with it ask again and I&#039;ll clarify.<br /><br />PathSeeker:&nbsp; The email address serves a couple purposes.&nbsp; It&#039;s a secondary identifier and when using tormail or another secure email service it&#039;s also a business card as it were.&nbsp; Many people put in fake email addresses. sometimes vendor&#039;s put their tormail account in there so in case the SR goes down their customers can contact them.<br /><br />The longest I&#039;ve heard of from a reputable member that&#039;s been here a while was 5X days.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember exactly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard unsubstantiated claims of 60+ days from Germany or the netherlands.

				&nbsp;8)<br />Thanks for the info, I can digest the process a little easier now. One short question- When you encrypt your address and select the vendors public key, is that when they get the private key to decrypt your message? What an awesome way to keep things private !&nbsp; &nbsp;Have a great day.&nbsp; ;)

				When you open the software click on &#039;keys&#039;-&gt;&#039;new key&#039; and enter the desired information.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use your real name, use a handle or your username on SR, and set up a tormail email address and enter that.&nbsp; When you&#039;re done you&#039;ll have your own key set.&nbsp; That is, a private and a public key.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give ANYONE your private key or post it anywhere.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need a password for it, but it&#039;s what you&#039;ll use to decrypt any messages to you.&nbsp; The key you give out(and the key you get from a vendor) is a public key.&nbsp; it&#039;s the half that allows someone to encrypt a message to you.<br /><br />Does that clarify enough?

				Thats the purpose here.&nbsp; It&#039;s shipped to you so you don&#039;t have to go somewhere else.&nbsp; DON&#039;T try to smuggle it yourself.&nbsp; That has a much higher possibility of getting caught.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to order overseas there are many vendors that have ordered international(importing it) and resell it domestically.

				prior to the introduction of hedging, especially when BTC was montetized at low levels there were fairly substantial (percentage wise) swings in BTC value.&nbsp; You might place your order Sunday and by Wednesday BTC value might have swung up or down 30%-50%.&nbsp; This made it difficult for vendors to plan and price ther products effectively.&nbsp; With hedging, for a fixed fee, the transaction maintains a constant price in USD from order to finalize.&nbsp; This takes a significant cost of doing business consideration&nbsp; off of the vendors which helps them price their wares with more stability.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t payed much attention to BTC valuations bit I seem to remember a crash a year or more ago where BTC went down to $2 or so (and sometime prior to that it was up to $30).&nbsp; Now it is back to $15.&nbsp; <br /><br />So lately, there is not too much reason to finalize early since BTC valuation is fairly stable and hedging is available.&nbsp; In the past I have not worried too much about doing FE for trusted vendors.&nbsp; In recent times most of the trusted vendors don&#039;t even request FE unless you a newbie on SR.&nbsp; The escrow system is really what makes SR work and provides needed protection for the buyers.&nbsp; Without escrow who would try out new vendors?

				On my first purchase of any significant quantity i was asked to FE. I did it as i had been following the vendor for a while and they had flawless stats. I could see why he wanted me to FE - for all he knew&nbsp; i could be a fellow vendor trying to sabotage his ratings. I was anxious about FEing, still did it anyway as the stats spoke for themselves. My fears were put to rest when i opened the mailbox the next day ;) <br /><br />My advice on FEing is RESEARCH! Research the vendor and make a judgement yourself.

A good way to determine sensitive data other than your address and whatnot is to ask yourself before you post if any of the information could be used to profile you or narrow you down out of the general populace.&nbsp; There are a number of great threads around on using pgp encryption.&nbsp; I would advise you to navigate to the security subforum located here(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=3.0) and then use the search bar on the top right corner of the page to locate some guides.&nbsp; It will be good practice for you. <br /><br />As a rule you should search the forums before asking questions, but if you&#039;re really stumped it&#039;s better to ask than to risk security breaches. In this case I offered to answer questions so I&#039;m not in the least concerned.&nbsp; The only reason I mention it is the incredible amount of questions asked over and over since nobody takes the time to try and search first.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you still have issues post again and I&#039;ll help you out.<br /><br />3) I&#039;d say there honestly aren&#039;t many pros.&nbsp; maybe if you don&#039;t have your own computer?&nbsp; The cons are numerous.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t supposed to load any software on the library computers, I don&#039;t know how you would run your encryption software, People would see what you&#039;re doing, You&#039;re on camera, many library&#039;s have the ability to monitor what you&#039;re doing on the computers, the library account you would be using would be linked to you, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;d seriously recommend looking into getting a secure thumbdrive and loading on that on your computer or you friend&#039;s if you don&#039;t have one. once again you can find tutorials in the security subforum using the search function. Make sure to be in the security forum when you search as the search only looks in the area of the forum you are already in. <br /><br />Once again if you have issues with this post again and I&#039;ll give you more direct .<br /><br />Ok, Thanks.

				According to Shulgin, a dose of MDMA is supposed to be 120mg. Who knows what MMM&#039;s &quot;sample&quot; dose is supposed to be. You would think a sample dose would be a proper correct dose (i.e. 120mg) otherwise how the hell are you supposed to really sample it? <br /><br />The MDMA in the pic looks quite chunky. I imagine if you crush it it will fluff out and look bigger. So im going to say that it is likely that there could be two proper 120mg doses there. But then i&#039;m not familiar with US money so its hard to say.<br /><br />One way to find out if its any good - split it in half and eat one half. If you get that full on MDMA euphoria then its legit. If you dont, well it could still be legit but the vendor hasnt given you a correct dose and is therefore prob not worth dealing with in the future anyway. So my advice is eat it, its win win.

				Cross-posting from here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108659.msg753655#msg753655<br /><br />How crucial is it to boot from USB?&nbsp; I bought a brand new netbook and USB drive solely for SR-ing after lurking and researching for several months; however, I apparently got the lowest possible model and it doesn&#039;t even have a CD/DVD drive, which (if I am understanding correctly, looking at this thread for example - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101603.0) will prevent me from getting TAILS running on my USB.<br /><br />Are there any workarounds for this, or can I have your input into the necessity of booting from USB if I am otherwise doing the following:<br /><br />- Access SR only on via Tor Bundle on public wifi<br />- Use Netbook ONLY for SR and other TOR-related stuff (i.e. no mixing of ANY personal or clearnet info - no Amazon, gmail, etc)<br />- Communicate with vendors ONLY using PGP<br />- PGP keys saved to TrueCrypt volume on (non-booting) USB drive<br /><br />Where does the virtual machine factor into all of this - also needed?&nbsp; I have VirtualBox from Oracle installed but have not fully dived in.

				Does anyone know how much more of a risk it is to order things from over seas? I really want to get The White Skulls but they&#039;re only in Germany and I&#039;ve read that over seas shipment adds a very very high risk of it getting found and even higher chance of them busting straight into your house.

In that case you won&#039;t get the page of course but someone suggested the DNS could be capturing these requests, at least for known hidden services. You just have to keep clearnet/darknet activities seperated.<br />You might learn some more if you are not such a dick.<br />

				Bro, my reaction was justified by you giving bad advice.&nbsp; Read through Pine&#039;s threads.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if you have been around that long.&nbsp; She covered it pretty well as did guru.&nbsp; I stated I&#039;m not a security expert, but you aren&#039;t well versed in it either, obviously.&nbsp; <br /><br />The fact that you&#039;ve admitted there ARE reasons why a person should not do so nullifies your argument.&nbsp; Especially since we&#039;re in the Newbie Discussion subforum and I made this thread TO HELP THE NEWBIES.&nbsp; Why would you tell them that without even making them aware of the security risks.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t go into detail because it would needlessly complicate and elongate this thread which you have accomplished making it difficult for them to find their answers.&nbsp; The other reason I didn&#039;t give them the exact reason but told them to search for it was to make them independent in their searching so they rely on others less.&nbsp; So i suppose I don&#039;t mind you acting the fool and clogging up this thread as it will also help them learn to use the search function.<br /><br />The first risk you mentioned is part of the reason I gave advice to maxieB earlier in this thread to use a *clearnet warning* which sparked this discussion.&nbsp; The second is possible.&nbsp; I&#039;d think it wouldn&#039;t be terribly probable though as some systems are setup to automatically route any request for darknet domains through a tor2web service.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you&#039;d gone back through and read the thread I&#039;ve been around for a while.&nbsp; I was admittedly one of the first gawker wave, but my User ID on the road was &lt; 10,000.&nbsp; You probably don&#039;t remember being able to see who registered in what order on the market.&nbsp; You also probably don&#039;t remember the days when every account had the ability to sell Items.&nbsp; And the only reason an account changed to a vendor account was if the person listed an item for sale. this was before the fee to become a vendor.&nbsp; This was EVEN before the idea to AUCTION off vendor accounts; LONG before THIS forum existed in any small inkling of it&#039;s current form.&nbsp; So back the fuck down and don&#039;t question your elder, boy<br />

It was a sample from a new vendor who got his account banned after a couple weeks when nobody&#039;s pack turned up.&nbsp; Most people who say stuff didn&#039;t show up are just scamming the vendors.<br /><br />I personally wouldn&#039;t hesitate to purchase from overseas.&nbsp; Just do your research and be aware it may take 4 days or a month to arrive.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;d verify with the vendor(if it isn&#039;t stated on their profile) whether they require a signature.<br /><br />As far as a delivery point, most people are of the opinion that it&#039;s better to use an address, but some people aren&#039;t in the position to do that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used a po box but if my circumstances changed and I needed to I&#039;d feel comfortable doing so if I set it up using a fake name.
