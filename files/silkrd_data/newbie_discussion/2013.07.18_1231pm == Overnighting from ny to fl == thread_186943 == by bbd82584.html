				I ordered 3 or 4 small orders from separate vendors and they are stestimated to be delivered today or tomorrow.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my issue, had to leave home on a family emergency but i need my parcels asap. A friend is willing to grab the parcels from my house, collect them and overnight them to me for a sat delivery.&nbsp; Question: most of these vendors dont offer overnight, a few do priority.&nbsp; I can go into SOME detail about packaging if anyone thinks it&#039;s relevant, but i dont think any of the #4 is vacuum sealed, just double-zip-locked but these vendors are top sr vendors and i havent known them to have issues.&nbsp; This is my question though, if my proxy simply takes my packages as they are (wont open envelope, just black-out return and shipping info on all with a sharpie) and puts the envelopes in a bigger usps envelope and overnights it to me, what are the risks involved?&nbsp; I know from the shipping threads that anything that gets on a plane is subject to search by canine and I&#039;m guessing that is possibly why many vendors wont ship express/overnight?&nbsp; Would it be safer to go with a parcel service like ups/fedex?&nbsp; I worked at a fedex ground for almost a decade and never saw a dog in my hub, but then again, we were a ground service and weren&#039;t situated on a runway.&nbsp; Whats the best/safest way to do this? Are they subj to xray? suggestiong?

				Doesn&#039;t sound like it would be exceptionally risky to me, although if you&#039;re really paranoid you could just wait. To be honest if you think about it, even if the parcel was examined it basically just looks like someone is having their mail sent to them on holiday or something.

				So, what i&#039;m asking is if he should throw my mail in a mylar bag to foil xray? I could have him seal it all up in a bag of doritoes or something.&nbsp; Would this be more suspect than just throwing it all in an express envelope and overnighting it?&nbsp; I checked the scheduling, it wont leave my local post office until 6pm Friday night and will be to me by noon Sat. Can I get some knowledge?&nbsp;
