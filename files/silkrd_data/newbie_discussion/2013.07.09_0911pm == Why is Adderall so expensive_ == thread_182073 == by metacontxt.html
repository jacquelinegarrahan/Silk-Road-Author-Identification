				OK so I&#039;ve been looking online for Adderall sellers on SR and holy shit is their gear expensive! I&#039;ve bought some reasonably hardcore prescription stuff like generic alprazolam (Xanax) from regular websites and it&#039;s come through ok. Yes yes I know it&#039;s not the genuine Pfizer gear, but it does the job. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a lot of Adderall sellers on the web. A lot of them look dodgy as fuck, and there&#039;s no way I&#039;m giving my credit card details to them. There are one or two websites that sell Adderall that appear legitimate, and a 30mg pill costs about $4 each. But....<br /><br />In Australia we dose our wayward kids with 5mg dextroamphetamine tablets - they get a prescription of 5 - 8 or so a day. They&#039;re supposed to take them gradually through the day. If you want to buy these tabs under the table for the buzz/concentration and not the pharmaceutical benefit, they can be had from about $4 ea (reasonable) to $10 a tab (vendor&#039;s fucking dreaming and I&#039;m sure no one&#039;s buying) on SR. This is not a dodgy cook up - it&#039;s the standard pharmaceutical shit ADHD kids take in Australia. You have a prescription and a bottle of 100x5mg pills costs you $12. No prescription and the same bottle costs $400 minimum through the back door.<br />&nbsp;<br />Adderall consists of 30mg active ingredient - 3/4 dextroamphetamine and 1/4 levoamphetamine. So they&#039;re stronger than the 5mg pills in Australia. Wouldn&#039;t mind getting some of that. <br /><br />But it costs in the region of $120 for 5x30mg Adderall pills on SR. Why so pricey? Even the lower strength (10-20mg) pills are $15-20 apiece.&nbsp; I have no doubt the shit you get on SR is the real deal, but I don&#039;t understand why simple 5mg dexies we have in Australia can be bought on SR so much more cheaply than Adderall. And why there&#039;s such a big difference between the pricing of Adderall on pharma websites that have reliably sold me shit like Modafinil in the past and what you get on SR. To be honest, I trust the SR vendors more than I do the non-script pharma sites, but it still makes me wonder...<br /><br />Why is Adderall so expensive?
