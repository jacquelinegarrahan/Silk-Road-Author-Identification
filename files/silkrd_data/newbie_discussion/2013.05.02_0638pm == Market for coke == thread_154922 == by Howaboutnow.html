				Hey SR,<br /><br />I have a good local source here that has some incredible pearl coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;I was looking to sell here on SR but it cost a fortune to open a seller account, so I thought I would ask if people were interested before I buy and pay this fee.<br /><br />If I do a g for $125 would anyone be interested?<br /><br />This stuff is strong and I know from personal experience :)<br /><br />Let me know.<br /><br />Thanks SR

				LOL yea good point! <br /><br />How would you even scam on here?&nbsp; They take a deposit incase you do scam and if I require no FE and track the packages then there is no chance of anyone getting scammed, right?<br /><br />&nbsp;I guess just list it and then let the reviews decide and build a solid rep on SR.<br /><br />

				I will never pay that much for a G.&nbsp; I know what an ounce goes for on the street for some nice soft.&nbsp; Seems pointless to pay triple price anywhere.

				I honestly can&#039;t believe anyone buys coke on SR with these outrageous prices. Seriously I can get a g of decent stuff for $60. And I&#039;ve tried several vendors here on SR (all claiming to have hi-heat &lt;---where the hell did that come from anyway). Only one time did I get anything better than the street stuff for $60. My god, someone could seriously make a killing if they dropped the price of a g to reasonable amount on this site (like $80, free shipping domestic).<br /><br />I mean come on, the prices on MDMA and legit bud is reasonable. But WTF coke vendors. Seriously? $125 or more for a gram. What a shame. Oh well, keeps me from spending so much on drugs I guess.

				Yea it&#039;s only a matter of time before someone starts selling it at better prices.&nbsp; The more people sell it on SR, the further the price will be pushed down.&nbsp; Might be a while though.

				I agree little perm but I guess SR gets a cut of the price so the vendor only gets a certain amount so that&#039;s why the higher price.<br /><br />I&#039;ll see if I can do it cheaper but $80 is pretty low for here since that&#039;s not what the vendor actually gets in the long run.&nbsp; Maybe $100.00?<br /><br />Thanks for all your input!

				I bought Space Wranglers yay &amp; pay&#039;d a hefty price, I love it!<br /><br />Coke is so sketchy to get on the street.<br /><br />OP, I bought a G for higher than that here, but that was among the best in the world from one of the best vendors (he&#039;s stealth now)<br /><br />But to answer your question, yes people will pay that, but it&#039;s better if you sell in 8 balls or Oz&#039;s
