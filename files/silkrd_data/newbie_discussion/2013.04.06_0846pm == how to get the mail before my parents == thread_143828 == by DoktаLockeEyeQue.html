				I&#039;d get drugs sent in letters and not in parcels, for one. I don&#039;t think your parents would open letters. You could also start getting the mail every morning, and not just when you&#039;re expecting your stuff, that way it&#039;d be a habit and it won&#039;t look suspicious to your parents.<br />You could also order them to another place, like a friend&#039;s house (only if he agrees!) or a PO box.. Maybe send yourself letters before your order arrives so that you have kind of a cover-story if your parents ask why you get mail from someone they don&#039;t know of I guess.. You could even send yourself parcels or order a lot on ebay to make them less suspicious about those. That&#039;s what I&#039;d do at least.

				Order a few cheap (but vaguely useful) bits from ebay/amazon. So they&#039;re used to little things arriving for you. See what they do with it and see if they ask what it is. Using this you can gauge how viable having drugs delivered is.

				Work out an avaerage time that the mailman comes and then go for a jog at that time every morning, or a walk or whatever. Then you could intercept him and your parents wouldn&#039;t know you had any mail whatsoever.

				give your parents a quasi lethal amount of melatonin roughly 9 hrs before your package comes. <br />or you could mail yourself some shiz/sign up for mailing lists like someone said earlier so its normal that you receive mail.<br />I&#039;m sure they won&#039;t open your mail if you make it clear to them how much you like opening your own mail...

(by the way if you do this, you sure as shit better get them a present LOL)<br /><br />If you&#039;re in school during the day and your folks are at home/getting the mail while you&#039;re gone, well you&#039;re pretty much fucked.&nbsp; Again, you may want to try the &quot;I have a present/surprise coming for you so don&#039;t open my mail or you&#039;ll ruin it&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also you could tell them that you ordered some old time film negatives for a girl at school who you like (you&#039;d want to say that you ordered large format negatives which are big, like 10x the size of a 35mm).&nbsp; Tell them that they&#039;re for an old large format camera her grandfather gave her.&nbsp; Inform them that they can&#039;t open the package because you don&#039;t want the negatives exposed to light (it will ruin them)... Any parent will vaguely relate to this as they all know what film is.&nbsp; Also they may sympathize with the girlfriend bit.&nbsp; If you&#039;re young and know how to use tor/get BTC/use silk road you&#039;re probably some pimply over weight gamer who would never have a girlfriend but it was just a suggestion. (sorry I had to go there).<br /><br />Good luck JR.&nbsp; Stay away from opiates/herion and I&#039;d suggest staying away from cocaine as well.&nbsp; Other than that BE SAFE, DON&quot;T DRIVE FUCKED UP.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Bill Paxton (trick love the kids)

				Definitely be careful and I agree with those who said you should make a habit of getting the mail every day so it seems normal and not suspicious. Maybe subscribe to a magazine or two and definitely order some random cheap stuff from sites like amazon or ebay so that you have random stuff coming and can always say, &quot;Oh it was just ____.&quot;<br /><br />If you keep some little trinkets laying around like new headphones and books, cds, little junk like action figures or whatever. Make it plausible and don&#039;t be too nervous or excited when the mail comes because that is usually what gets other people&#039;s attention if you are trying to be discreet about it.

				What are you, 12? If you&#039;re worried about your parents intercepting and opening your mail, you probably shouldn&#039;t be on SR.<br /><br />This also probably means you&#039;re a minor. In which case, if you get caught, your parents are also in trouble too. Keep that in mind.

				My english sucks, <br /><br />how old are you?<br />sounds like a child. <br />And some things can be bad for a unmature mind.<br />I&nbsp; believe.<br /><br />And you also should know at what time the mailman go near your place, so wait there doing something, but have some<br />back storie to tell your parents, in case they show up and ask, whats in there?<br /><br />

				all it takes is being mature enough for your parents to not feel the need to check your mail. i myself am only just turned 19 and have ordered a few packages when i was as young as 17 (although not from SR) but even then they sat on the table all day while im at work with not as much as second guess on the nature of my letters. <br />if you&#039;re not mature enough for your parents to trust your decisions then you&#039;re almost definitely not old enough to be ordering, however someone who is able to figure out how to reach SR and do everything necessary in order to be in a position of ordering should be at least intelligent enough for his parents to trust him. <br />however if you dont have the kind of parents who will see that you&#039;re definitely not in a position of ordering.<br />Also, only order letters. if you dont already have one a bank account could help with the fact they frequently send statements and/or news.<br />either way, SR is definitely not a place for minors! if i had my hands on this when i was 15 i would be twice as fucked up as i already am so if you are young, just think about it. its like the keys to heaven and hell at the same time.

I&#039;m all for legalization of most drugs and all, but there is something to be said about brain development. Your brain doesn&#039;t stop developing until your early 20s or so (this is often the rationale given for the drinking age of 21 in the US). Drugs can fuck with that. Not to mention that the last parts to fully develop are the ones in charge of things like decision-making, which is why a lot of teens are impulsive and don&#039;t make the best choices.<br /><br />Obviously, do what you want, kid. Just know the consequences (well that goes for everybody, but whatever).

				Do not try and beat your parents to the mailbox. That&#039;s impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth...<br /><br />get your own mailbox<br />

				As has already been mentioned here: Just order some cheap junk from dealextreme.com<br /><br />Have your parents get used to receiving international packages. They won&#039;t see anything suspicious.<br /><br />Most Silk Road sellers package their good to be indistinguishable from regular business mail. They&#039;re really stealthy.<br /><br />

				The only time I ever worried about my parents figuring out I was using drugs was when I still lived with them and my mom did my laundry. On occasions I would forget there was empty heroin stamp bag in my pants pockets. She never discovered them thankfully.... but I did loose a few bags of weed that way. <br /><br />&gt;_&lt;

				If you have to worry about you&#039;re parents getting you&#039;re drugs before you then just GTFO of the SR. Stop doing drugs and go back to school.
