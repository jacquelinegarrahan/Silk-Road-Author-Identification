				I&#039;m relatively new to purchasing on SR-- just made my first purchases.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m being secure using TOR, encryption, etc., but I have a few questions about overall privacy while browsing with TOR on SR.<br /><br />It is my understanding that TOR makes it so that your IP address is a different or fake location, therefore, your real location can&#039;t be determined.&nbsp; How does the internet connection factor into this?&nbsp; While on TOR, is it possible to see what internet connection one is using?<br /><br />I have TOR downloaded onto a USB-- is it possible for someone monitoring your computer to tell that it is being run off of a USB?&nbsp; If so, does the USB give out the location of your computer? <br /><br />For those just using TOR to browse and purchase, any suggestions or random things I should know?<br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; 8) ~namaste

				Only the tor entry node knows your IP address, or whatever IP address you&#039;re coming from. For hidden services such as SR you don&#039;t come out an exit node so there is no risk there. If you&#039;re accessing Tor from your own internet connection, your ISP (and any eavesdroppers such as the NSA) definitely know you&#039;re hitting Tor entry nodes (and that&#039;s true whether you&#039;re using Tails or not - there are ways to prevent that though such as a VPN or proxy).

Or just that I am using TOR?<br /><br />Also, another general question about BTC-- they aren&#039;t illegal to have, obviously, so being registered with a real name through a provider should be OK, right? I send them to bunk name wallets a few times, all on TOR, then into SR.&nbsp; My name IS associated with the purchasing of them, but it should vanish off of them once I move them out of the original account, correct?&nbsp; These BTC could be used for reddit, etc.. I was under the impression that Bitinstant--&gt;wallet using a MoneyGram at a local CVS could be done with a false name, etc., but I had to register with Bitinstant using real information and the MG person (via the &quot;red phone&quot; at CVS), needed my real information, too (I tried to give her a different last name and it didn&#039;t work).&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t mind having my real information on the original purchase of the BTC, but would like to know that once I tumble them, their final destination can&#039;t be connected to my original purchase...<br /><br />Thanks!!&nbsp;
