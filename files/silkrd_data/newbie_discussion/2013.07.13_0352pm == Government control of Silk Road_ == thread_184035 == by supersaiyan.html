				I&#039;m a newbie on the forums, however I have been using the Silk Road for a good while now, enough to call myself knowledgeable of the market.<br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />I was with some friends a couple nights ago, one of them being a very reputable and well known mushroom hunter/seller in my local area. We were in conversation of sources and products, and I asked him if he had heard of the Silk Road and what his thoughts were of the multimillion dollar drug dealing site. His reply to my question caught me off guard, because he said something along the lines of he and his friends (business partners) believed the Silk Road to be an underground government operation to seal off the fate of the customers and dealers on it. I of course thought his proposition was absurd, but I just wanted to know what you guys think of this statement. I assume most of you believe it&#039;s not an operation controlled by the government, considering most of you are using the forums and marketplace for yourself, regardless I would still like to read what thoughts you have about the claim.

				You really should be able to get to the bottom of this absurd claim yourself. Are there thousands of users on the forums who have spent thousands of dollars each in the store? Yes. Does the government send drugs to people worldwide to eventually catch them? No, they do not.

				While your friends claim that the &quot;whole operation&quot; is a DOJ run sting is absurd, I wouldn&#039;t be a bit surprised if they had, or do, pose as sellers or buyers in an attempt to build their case against and collect info against SR and/or it&#039;s sellers/user&nbsp; It seems like if they weren&#039;t, they should, as a strategy to build their case.&nbsp; You would likely have infinitely more to worry about&nbsp; as a seller, or someone who is moving a lot of coin through the site, than you would being a customer.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

I don&#039;t study this shit or anything, in fact I try not to watch any news anymore, because I&#039;m just done being a citizen of this country. <br /><br />I imagine the mafia regrouped in Chicago, and are now THE GOVERNMENT. Organized Crime, Chicago Gangland, Obama, Holder, Rahm Emmanual get&#039;s the mayors job? The mayors brother gets a job with Obama. The smell of corruption pouring out of Washington DC, is worse than at any other time in our nations history! <br /><br />I think it goes beyond just our shores. Just like organized crime. Technology has brought everyone closer. Isn&#039;t that nice? :P<br />Hollywood writes the scripts for the show called World News Tonight. (pick any channel, they&#039;re all reading from the same script).<br />This very well COULD be run by those who run everything else. <br /><br />The shit is going to hit the fan one day. Who knows? <br /><br />This is just a scenario. (Or one of those crappy Sci-Fi Channel movies ::))

				sigh.......................................... If LE controlled SR they wouldn&#039;t be doing it for long. They would never win one case if they continually operated a site that is supplying illegal drugs. If SR did get taken over, it might be for 30 days tops (with a court order) and then it gets shut down and whoever they were able to profile gets busted.

				Even if the government did own the Tor hidden service, it would still be difficult busting vendors and sellers. <br /><br />Most vendors and sellers communicate with PGP encrypted messages and (hopefully) take serious thought into anti-profiling techniques and maintaining anonymity.

				To be honest it&#039;s pretty far fetched. Anyone who is not a complete moron uses PGP to communicate securely through the site.<br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t make sense that it&#039;s a big government sting unless they&#039;re solely relying on the three buyers who don&#039;t use PGP or they&#039;re storing all PGP encrypted addresses and vendor public keys en masse and plan to decrypt them when&nbsp; quantum computation actually becomes a real thing.<br /><br />Both scenarios are highly unlikely because of things like &quot;resources to results ratios&quot; and &quot;statues of limitation&quot;.<br /><br />I personally believe that it&#039;s fucking retarded to believe that it&#039;s a conspiracy. Although never trust silk road with any unencrypted personally identifying information.

				On one side I can see where your friend got his idea from. An online market place where people can buy any drug they feel like does seem a little too good to be true. I don&#039;t think the government would take the time to set up a scheme this elaborate though. This website is small beans compared to a cartel drug smuggling operation. Are they really going to waste time and money looking for people buying an ounce of two of coke from the internet? but in reality who knows.

				from what iv read the navy developed tor and the government is always over 20 years more advanced than regular society not to mention more corrupt and a darker place than than anywhere else in society. how do we not know the only reason why we have to post 50 times so we can post with the big boy&#039;s is so they can try match our writing style to posts from the normal net! Don&#039;t go and pass on what i said as fact or say I&#039;m paranoid and deluded, this is just an observation and thoughts (yes I&#039;m rushing).<br />If someone has an idea it will happen if they fail there will be someone inspired by their ideas who will continue with it, and who tries to gain all information available..... the government, don&#039;t be afraid just be cautious and trust you spidey sense&#039;s and never admit anything cause your only giving them the evidence they need. Drugs make us think they don&#039;t want us to think. Think about it!<br /><br />109
