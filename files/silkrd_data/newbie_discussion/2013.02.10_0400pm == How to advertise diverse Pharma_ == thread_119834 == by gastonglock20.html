				Since I&#039;m brand new to this forum, I want to say a &quot;Hello&quot; to all you guys!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Just have a 3 hour non-stop reading contest on this forum behind me and now I&#039;m curious about finding customers.<br />I have access to an area where you can buy very easy -and mostly quite affordable- diverse pharmaceuticals -that usually need a prescription from your physician- right at one of thousands of pharmacy stores. <br />This includes diverse steroids, viagra, and on and on.<br /><br />However, my problem is, that I don&#039;t know much about this things, but I want to offer the products to people who can&#039;t buy them in their own country.<br /><br />I uploaded a -not complete- list on a fileshareing platform and I would appreciate some useful comments, if there are any interesting pharmaceuticals (I know for a fact, that in the former mentioned area a lot of Bodybuilder buy their in many countries &quot;illegal&quot; stuff in said pharmacies) in this list. If you are looking for something else that you can buy in some pharmacies but maybe not in your own country, let me know and I&#039;ll check.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Here is a link to this pdf file: www.filefactory.com/file/5w3djz97lsn1/n/Pharma_Liste_pdf<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Gaston

				First of all many people might be careful with opening PDFs from a unknown source.<br />You should upload it somewhere where people can look at it without hassle like:<br />http://pastebin.com<br />Anyway, you can sell about anything on Silk Road.<br />The more you offer the more you sell, which in turn generates more and better reputation and thus profit.<br />Also, i would start with free or cheap samples to gain trust from buyers and accumulate positive feedback.
