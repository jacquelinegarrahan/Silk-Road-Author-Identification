				I was debating purchasing a vendor account, how&#039;s the demand on coke on here? <br /><br />Would be offering:<br /><br />Coke <br />Crack (In future)<br />Weed (In future)<br />MDMA Capsules (In future)<br />XTC (In future)<br /><br />What you can expect:<br /><br />Bulk Amounts &amp; Small Amounts (Coke)<br />Free Samples to 10 people (100mg each)<br />Fast, free shipping.<br />Professional &amp; Discreet shipping.<br />Shipping from Canada to Everywhere.<br />Quality<br />Fast Communication <br />No FE<br /><br />The coke I offer is uncut now by this I mean it&#039;s uncut by me and my source, I believe people will pay more for quality.<br /><br />Coke would be introductory @ $105 p/g and shipping to anywhere.

				Check out this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.0;topicseen<br /><br />It&#039;s the official coke review thread. I was surprised by how much scrutiny the products and vendors are.<br />There is definitely demand though and SR is growing by the day. I think that n00b friendly vendors will be in demand.&nbsp; However, I think it&#039;s a long term investment. At least it is for me.<br /><br />Also, please please please search for the &quot;so you want to become a vendor&quot; thread. I can&#039;t remember what it is called exactly. It should be stickied if its not. Following these guidelines is so important for the safety of Silk Road users and YOU. I would replace vac seal with moisture barrier bag heat seal, however. We have learned that vacuum seal is not sufficient. <br /><br />Also, read the stickied threads in the Shipping section in great length. This should give you a better grasp on how packages get nicked when they do get nicked. <br /><br />Anyway, I guess I could summarize by asking that for SR&#039;s sake, anyone that wants to become a vendor does a fair amount of research beforehand.<br /><br />May the wind be at your back! Cheers.

				As far as demand, that will always be there.&nbsp; The quality will be the difference.&nbsp; If you can get &#039;mother of pearl&#039; quality, then thats the caviar so to speak. Pink peruvian too.
