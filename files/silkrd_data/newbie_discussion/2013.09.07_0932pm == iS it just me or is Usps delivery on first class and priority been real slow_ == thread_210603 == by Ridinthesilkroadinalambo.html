				So, I&#039;ve noticed over the past several months or so that usps delivery time on first class and priority mail has been xtremly unpredictable! At first months ago, when priority didnt arrive after the 3rd buisness day, I would start stressing out! At this point I&#039;ve noticed sum packages get here in 2-3 days,while others take over a week to arrive. I&#039;m in a city as well not a rural podunk area! I realize that Usps has changed around their schedule on delivering first class and priority on saturdays but seriously even with knowing those methods are not guarenteed,Is it just me or is everyone noticing the slow delivery time of Usps? Jeez, ordering on SR is starting to get stressful with the unredictable domestic delivery time!

				4-8 days is crazy. I&#039;m so sorry that you&#039;ve been waiting like that :(<br /><br />I feel like all my priority mail has been 2-3 days. If there was a sudden change to that I would be quite worrysome.

				Yea had an order come recently in 2 1/2 days from when it was marked in transit and still have orders that were marked in transit on 8/30 and still havent arrived and they have all been domestic orders. Yea there was the holiday recently which usps wasnt open. Even with having experienced a great deal of packages not arriving in a timely manner over the past few months, it still stresses me out.At least I&#039;m not pestering the vendor this time around but as each day passes you start to get more tense that it isnt there. Yea eventually it comes but jeez i&#039;m tired of questioning whats up every single package!

				It could be that sellers are dispatching their product as promised. A lot of the time people mark your order &quot;in transit&#039; when in fact it isn&#039;t. I usually mark mine in transit a few hours early, but I always send a shipping confirmation to the buyer so they know what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />First Class is pretty much useless. Seems stuff always gets lost or stolen. I like the new priority system now though. Most things are 2 day delivery. 2 days for the government to get something done is pretty damn impressive.

				It&#039;s still better than UPS, who now takes a full week to get packages from Cali to upstate NY.

				Not only is USPS pretty damn good but their prices are awesome.&nbsp; $5 and change for a small priority package to go anywhere in the US?&nbsp; DIRT CHEAP!&nbsp; They&#039;re already talking about hiking up the rates in the future so there&#039;s no way these prices will last.&nbsp; The USPS is just too broke.&nbsp; They&#039;re talking about privatizing everything except the out the door delivery and jacking up rates.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty nervous about the privatizing part.&nbsp; If UPS and FedEx are higher risk because they&#039;re private companies I wonder how it&#039;ll work out when companies like that are behind the USPS?&nbsp; Anyways I&#039;m just going off the deep end.&nbsp; To answer your question, I&#039;ve been having some success with them recently.&nbsp; Although a few months back I had a priority package take 7 delivery days.&nbsp; That was easily my longest ever.&nbsp; Most come in 2-3 days.&nbsp; Even after labor day.&nbsp;

				Yea unfortunately,things are so unpredictable for every SR order that anyone orders.As everyone can see a few people say yea it is taking long and others are saying that overall they have had no problems receiving orders.And I have to say,I think everyone is correct in their assesment because Over the past 4-5 months i&#039;ve had the full spectrum of delivery,sumtimes 2 days from all different areas of the US and 8 days from all different areas of the US.<br />In the past when a delivery was off i would message the vendor repeatedly and feel like an ass a week later when the package arrived.or I would post a question on the forum and say it been 5 buisness days and my package isn&#039;t here yet without mentioning the vendor and people would be like &quot;I don&#039;t kno what you ordered but maybe you should have ordered valium cuz you need to chill the fuck out, it&#039;ll get there when it gets there.&quot; and Ultimately it would arrive. In fact after&nbsp; 1 year and many many orders everything has always gotten to me one way or another!<br />Still...one can&#039;t helped but get paranoid when it&#039;s been more than 4 buisness days and priority isn&#039;t there! And anyone who has one iota of intelligence,knows that officialy your not &quot;expecting any packages&quot; meaning that the diamond rings your definently ordered from the department store and placed insurance on,is less nerve racking cuz you can simultaneously bombard the post office/department store daily with your info and tracking #.....but as hard as it is to refrain from contacting the vendor but especially the post office, if your smart you say &quot;No reason to contact post office. I&#039;m not expecting a package&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish sumhow vendors could have displayed average shipping time in the feedback cuz then the vendor from cali shipping to cali or all the way to abu dabi, would have an average on shipping times. Ok yea so vendors don&#039;t control the post office but at least this way, the dude from cali and abu dabi could see the overall shipping speed and with this info buyers could decide whether they musrt set their computer on fire or just &quot;chill the fuck out and take a valium&quot;
