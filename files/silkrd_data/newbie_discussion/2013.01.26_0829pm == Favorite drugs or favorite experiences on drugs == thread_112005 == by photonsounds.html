				Lets gets those posts up, people. So we can actually take part in the rest of SR.<br /><br /><br />I like to smoke JWH-018 on LSD and get straight up retarded. The patterns and colors overwhelm me, I can barely talk and almost lose motor coordination abilities, and my mind drifts off into a bliss. I can&#039;t imagine how bad I am fucking my brain up.<br /><br />Got that local connect on LSD for $5 a hit so I don&#039;t have to be stuck with the retarded domestic US prices, or deal with customs to get a decent deal. <br /><br />YEAH

				I fucking love psychedelics. LSD, Shrooms, 2C-I, 2C-B, they&#039;re all a crazy adventure that I can&#039;t get enough of.

				One of my favorite memories was back in the day, I had taken some ecstasy and I was driving, aimlessly.&nbsp; All of the sudden, I heard Kanye West&#039;s Diamonds from Sierra Leone for the first time (I had a pretty sick system in my car back then too) -- it was one of the most amazing things I have ever done.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to do it again!

				Not my favorite experience but one time I got a blow job right after I had blasted off into dmt hyperspace. I was vaguely aware that an alien was trying to eat me, I was pleasantly surprised when I came back.
