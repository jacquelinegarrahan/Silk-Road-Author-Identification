				7grams for 1bitcoin, your not going to get that. Bitcoins are worth around 35$, and most vendors haven&#039;t updated there prices yet due to the rising and falling nature of bitcoins at the minute, give it some time and your bitcoin will be worth 20$. <br /><br />1bitcoin will get you around 2-3grams, maybe a bit more if you want really shitty grassy weed.&nbsp; <br />Stick with street dealers until the bitcoin price stops going mad.

				Probably NOT gonna get that here.&nbsp; What you are buying locally for that price is probably dirt/brick weed...&nbsp; &nbsp; commercial marijuana grown without a whole lot of quality control, mass packaged, and mass shipped.&nbsp; This site is tailoring more to people looking for medical grade marijuana - typically grown indoors, bred for specific strain and indica vs sativa content, most probably grown seedless.&nbsp; So, you are looking at widely different qualities, which is why the prices are so high.<br />I HAVE seen a couple postings for lower quality marijuana, but I couldn&#039;t tell you who had it or if it was worth the purchase, and I think I saw it by the ounce, so idk...<br /><br />My suggestion would be to comb through every marijuana listing and see what you can find.&nbsp; <br /><br />But more to the point...&nbsp; there IS a limited amount of risk no matter what you do here, if you cant afford to loose 35$, then this may not be the place for you to find your product...<br /><br />

				You would have better luck running around the forum getting free samples. All you need to do is suck the vendors cock and give them a stellar review.

				lol on sucking up for free samples.&nbsp; I am actually getting irritated by the number of posts begging for spare bit coins and free samples.&nbsp; I would LOVE people to send me free samples and bitcoins.&nbsp; But...&nbsp; When I came up short, did I beg?&nbsp; Nope.....&nbsp; &nbsp;I took my hiney to go buy some more btc, waited the several hours for it to get through my wallet and to sr, missing my deadline to have the package shipped that day.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean, its not like I have a whole bunch of money, either, I dont.&nbsp; I just dont expect people to give me stuff for free, whether I suck up to them or not.&nbsp; I cannot think of any other context where I would go around bumming like that - I dont even do it for the vending machine.&nbsp;

				What a cheap ass..&nbsp; &nbsp;Seriously.&nbsp; You went through all the work of buying 1 bitcoin.&nbsp; !!! ??&nbsp; For your first purchase , this is what you prepared for before coming here? <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you are lying.&nbsp; Or yu begged your way up to 1 coin and now you want to buy?&nbsp; &nbsp;As if.<br /><br />&nbsp;1 coin isn&#039;t even the cost of shipping.<br />Go back to alley and keep begging for change from passerbys . <br /><br />Jeese, I&#039;m sure you can afford to buy more coins so that you could actually afford to shop in this store someday.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be mean here,&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying your story doesn&#039;t add up.&nbsp; It&#039;s your first buy and allyouhave is 1 coin!?&nbsp; &nbsp;You obviously didn&#039;t prepare yourself and are probably going to make other mistakes too.<br /><br />I&#039;m Hoping to scare you into buying more coins or at least taking more time to read .&nbsp; Especially the part where they show the prices !
