				NWD has been great to me in the past offering a sampling of four different strains, all dank and packaged nicely, and I left a review on their NWD official review thread.&nbsp; However, now since I&#039;m a newbie technically I cannot post in the general forums anymore until I become a junior member.. soo for any Newbies who have bought from or who are wondering about NorthWestDirect hopefully this thread helps.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my review of NWD!<br /><br />Strain: BlueBerry<br /><br />Shipping/Packaging:&nbsp; Item was shipped Saturday and received across the country on Thursday with excellent stealth.&nbsp; there was padding in the package and multiple layers of color barriers and finally the bud was vacuum and heat sealed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Looks/Smell:&nbsp; the Blueberry came in one nice size nug just over .5 g that was darker green in color with some nice tricome covered red hairs.&nbsp; The bud was sticky when broken apart and a very sweet berry-y aroma that was deliciously enticing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Smoke/Taste:&nbsp; This blueberry smokes really smoothly with an amazingly sweet aftertaste after the exhale.&nbsp; I could easily smoke this bud all day long and never get tired of the classic blueberry taste!<br /><br />High:&nbsp; The high was nice and stoney and took affect almost immediately after smoking a morning bong rip.&nbsp; A+ buds for sure every time with NWD for good prices!

				Thanks guys! yeah, I&#039;ve received a few samples and some larger orders that I feel responsible reviewing and all of the sudden I couldn&#039;t figure out how to reply... then I realized the newbie thing, Oh well we can write some quality reviews here while we have to, hope my input helped!<br /><br />

				Also already reviewed him in his main thread but will post on here to attest to his quality. QP of blueberry i got was good shit. Amazing color, good trich coverage, and a good but not overwhelming smell. Definitely would highly recommend. Also great communication

				Will x-post this to the vendor thread once I hit 50, but so far I&#039;m unsure. Made an order Tuesday, now its Friday and havent heard a thing and its still processing. No response back from the vendor either.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as sleepyg. However the vendor has just posted in the main thread found here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92632.375<br /><br />He&#039;s back and orders will be shipping out tonight. Says he&#039;s sorry for the delay. Still a big let down though, I&#039;ve been dry as a bone from 2 vendors going MIA on me in the past 2 weeks. Bad luck I guess&nbsp; ;)

				Hey bros... We were used to 10-15 orders daily then got hit with 25 yesterday and 50 today?!<br /><br />Lots more involved in this business then you might think.<br /><br />BTC to cash to get product, postage, stealth materials, etc.<br /><br />Then ship that many properly takes a LONG time and LOTS of driving, be patient.<br /><br />MLK day slowed down shipping ALOT no activity SUN or MON from USPS.<br /><br />Otherwise, all has been well. We have took listings down untill all is caught up which will be tonight. All who have ordered will get their packs Mon-Tues.<br /><br />We ALWAYS come through 9/10 within 3 days. SKYWALKER was unexpectedly INSANELY popular.<br /><br />Our 2 btc...<br /><br />Cheers &amp; Enjoy,<br /><br />NWD<br /><br />

He went MIA right before you did. Anyway, my package will be here Monday or Tuesday!? Hell yeah, that&#039;s good news for sure. I didn&#039;t think I would get it until Thursday or Friday since it still hasn&#039;t been marked in transit.
