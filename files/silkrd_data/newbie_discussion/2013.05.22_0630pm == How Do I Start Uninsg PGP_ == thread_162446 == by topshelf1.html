You can select to also install GPA (Gnu Privacy Assistant). Kleopatra and GPA are two graphical user interfaces, so they do pretty much the same thing but the one you decide to use is up to you. It doesn&#039;t matter which one you end up preferring to use, since both of them work just fine. GPA isn&#039;t set to install in the default installation of GPG4Win, but during installation you can select to install it if you wish.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162446.msg1154873#msg1154873">Quote from: topshelf1 on May 22, 2013, 06:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2..how do I get a public and private key?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You will be asked to make a key when you first launch Kleopatra or GPA.

Kleopatra is, however. You can run the install again afterwards if you didn&#039;t select GPA the first time, and install GPA if you want at a later point.<br /><br />When you open either of the programs, it will ask you to create a key. For your anonymity&#039;s sake, don&#039;t use your real name or an email that can be linked to your identity.<br />&nbsp;<br />Use a passphrase you can remember, though because if people want to message you with encrypted messages you will have to input your passphrase to decrypt them.<br /><br />Now that your key has been made, you can export your certificate/key by right clicking it and select to export. It will ask you to save a file, and you can open that file in a text editor to get your public key. This one is safe to share with others, and it&#039;s what others will use to encrypt messages that only you can read later. Never ever share your secret key.<br /><br />If you wish to encrypt a message to someone else, you&#039;ll have to have their public key. Save their public key as a file on your harddrive, and import it in GPA/Kleopatra. You can&#039;t use other people&#039;s public keys to decrypt anything.<br /><br />This is the big difference between GPA and Kleopatra, in my opinion; You can easily make an encrypted message for someone else by going to GPA&#039;s clipboard and write your message, then select to encrypt using the recipient&#039;s public key that you have saved. It&#039;ll tell you that you can&#039;t decrypt it after you have encrypted it, just as a reminder (not that you don&#039;t know what it says anyway). Then it will output the encrypted message that you can give to them. <br />They will then decrypt that message using their private key and passphrase.<br /><br />In Kleopatra, you&#039;ll have to create a file with your message, a regular txt file is fine. Then you&#039;ll have to go to File -&gt; Sign/Encrypt Files -&gt; select your file containing the message -&gt; Encypt, and make sure the Text output (ASCII armor) checkbox is checked -&gt; add the recipient&#039;s public key that you&#039;ve saved -&gt; Encrypt. <br />It will then output a file named the same as your file, and .asc at the end. You can open this file in a text editor and copy the contents to send to the person you encrypted the message for.<br /><br />When other people want to encrypt a message to you, they&#039;ll need to do the same steps with your public key. When you receive it, you will have to use your passphrase to decode it. It&#039;s pretty simple, actually! Try posting your public key in the Newbie PGP Club and have a quick conversation with someone, in private!<br /><br />I hope this quick guide will help you take the first few steps. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Well your last post pretty much guarantees no one will help.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t do it with what others have already said then there isn&#039;t much anyone else can say that will help you.<br /><br />You want&nbsp; an easy 123 step to using pgp?&nbsp; Here it goes, go to google.com, type &quot;how to use pgp windows&quot; and start reading.<br /><br />Update: You only have to read the first post of the newbie pgp thread, that is where the guide is.

				down load gpg4win, &amp; maybe print out the compendium, or parts that might be useful. in the program, you will go to whatever part it is, and simply press a button to generate your own pub/prvt key. get 1 or 2 extra email addresses &amp; practice with yourself. encrypt with your public key, send to your alt ego, &amp; decrypt with your prvt key. but hey - don&#039;t get sidetracked like me. depending on what you plan to do, the only thing you really need, is to be able to copy &amp; paste the pub key of a vendor with a product you like into notepad or wordpad. in most cases all you&#039;re ever going to do is encrypt your mailing address. so - you need to be able to copy that pub key, &amp; then, in &#039;GPA&#039; you type your address onto the &#039;clip board&#039;, select encrypt, choose vendors pub key, click ok, then copy &amp; paste result into your SR order form. as long as you have BTc in your account, hit submit order, &amp; you are on your way. don&#039;t get stressed, it all works pretty smooth.<br />the hardest part might be making sure your &#039;copy &amp; paste&#039; is perfect - no more, no less. also, keep visiting the SR PGP club. it is helpful.

				p.s. - using SR requires discipline &amp; patience. you don&#039;t just wake up one day, sign up, &amp; get molly in the mailbox the next day. depending on your background &amp; ability, the learning curve can be pretty steep. connections can be slow, servers will re-set. it is wise to use the road during off-peak times - early morning, late at night. don&#039;t just hang out on SR daydreaming. i take a 2-step approach. first i shop &amp; download vendor public keys, then i place an order at a different time &amp; day. when i order, i stay logged in as short as possible - 5 minutes.

				This was one of the biggest obstacles to start using SR. Sitting down and learning PGP might be one of the harder things I&#039;ve done on a computer (I think learning C as a teenager was easier, ha!). Keep at it and you&#039;ll have an &quot;a-ha!&quot; moment in a few hours. It&#039;s one of those things that seems impossible when you being, but eventually you realize it&#039;s just a matter of having a text editor. There&#039;s a plethora of info on the forums and various search engines. Best of luck!
