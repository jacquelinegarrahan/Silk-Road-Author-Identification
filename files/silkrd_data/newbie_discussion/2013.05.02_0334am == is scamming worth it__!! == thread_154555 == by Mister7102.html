				Is scamming really worth it?&nbsp; With the bond amount being so high you would have to do some pretty fancy footwork to make that up and get any sizable amount over that for it to be worth it.&nbsp; New vendors don&#039;t have customers so the only way I can think of would be to offer something that&#039;s probably too good to be true and in bulk then get multiple people to be stupid enough (or gullible) AND get them to FE!&nbsp; Really how is it possible?

				I wasnt around this long but apparently there was a vendor who was vending for YEARS and had a ton of fans who ordered from him regularly (I think the vendors name was Tony76 or Tony or something like that). He was one of the top vendor and everyone vouched for him. I forgot what the story was exactly but he claimed a bunch of buyers were trying to scam him and he asked everyone on the forums what he should do and everyone told him &quot;dont worry tony we&#039;ll all FE for you, your a trusted vendor!&quot; . It was around the time when he was running his 4/20 sale and everyone FE&#039;d and he made off with ALOT of money.

				It&#039;s perplexing why one would resort to gaming users for a few BTC. Profit margins are quite cushy for most products here on the Road, and one could easily make a fortune by simply running an honest business. If scammers would spend as much time organizing a legitimate business as they do overcoming hurdles for their swindle(vendor bond, fake accounts and feedback, forum interaction, et al), one would assume they could profit just as much, or more! <br /><br />It all boils down to greed and/or desperation for most. Picking apart the brain of a scammer, trying to understand how they justify their actions, can be intriguing. Not to derail the thread, but any suggestions for good documentaries on this subject?

With the vendor you split the risk.<br />What is keeping you from changing your feedback after receiving the refund if you were blackmailed to do so?<br /><br />HOWEVER...you can give a 5/5 but mention the package did not made it but how well the vendor reacted and refunded you to your satisfaction.<br />His reputation does not have to be less because of USPS or any other ....<br />It is usually not the fault of the vendor the package did not arrive (in general) ...so many things can go wrong in the -long- process.<br />How the vendor acts when problems happen....must or can reflect in the feedback.<br /><br />REMEMBER....NEVER FINALIZE EARLY !!!!

				The dangerous scammers are not the usual guys that do it willingly, the really dangerous ones are the vendors that established a lot of feedback in the years and then, for a motive or another (the most probable I think is that they just want to quit and decide to do so with a &quot;bang&quot;), scam all the people with that feedback and trust they formed in the years. It&#039;s very difficult to counteract something like that, and it is the most lucrative form of scam.<br /><br />These vendors didn&#039;t start to scam (probably at beginning never thought they would do), but for various motives (maybe also because they have problems) they exit the game scamming and taking all money they can with them.<br /><br />There have been many examples of this type of scam if you look at the forums, and in fact they scammed a lot of people with a lot of money.

				Scamming is worth it from a dollar-for-dollar perspective if you don&#039;t have an active supply running.<br /><br />For instance - I am some guy. I pay $500 for a seller account. I scam gullible people for ~$2000 in MoneyPak-BTC scams, or FE scams. I get banned. I made a profit.<br /><br />Example 2. I am some guy. I have a coke supply, where I have access to bricks of (sometimes) pure. I sell my good on the Road, after purchasing a seller account. I build reputation. Customers generally like me.<br /><br />In example 1, there is no harm (financially) from scamming others.<br /><br />In example 2, it&#039;s foolish to do so, unless my product&#039;s supply dries up.<br /><br />The sad fact is that at some point, the best vendors around run out of supply/retire/go under/have to lamb it. Some choose to rip people off before they go as one last business decision. They wouldn&#039;t do that in the real world, because they would probably be killed. The anonymous nature of the Road allows them to get one last money run in, with no product delivered.<br /><br />It&#039;s not always that they are scammers, they simply have nothing to lose if they were going to run out of product. Grabbing a final $15,000+ at 0% risk at 100% profit is extremely hard to say no to. From a business perspective, it&#039;s INSANE to say no to.<br /><br />Obviously, it&#039;s unethical to rip off &quot;honest&quot; customers who are just trying to buy a product. However, in the world of vendors (on the street), ethics aren&#039;t exactly the best way to get ahead. They bring that mentality here. Whereas a customer might be a utopian-minded person with a dream of a bazaar of drugs, information, electronics, etc, some vendors are simply drug dealers moving into a venue where they cannot be held responsible for their actions. A breeding ground for taking advantage of others.<br /><br />My own personal opinion is that while I think that scammers should be banned from the Road, and scamming should never be tolerated by the Road, I don&#039;t really hold anything against the bastards who rip others off. It&#039;s just their nature. They aren&#039;t seeing the &quot;bigger picture&quot; of SR, they&#039;re just seeing the &quot;bottom line&quot;. Stay smart about your business dealings, and you&#039;ll hopefully never get ripped. :)<br /><br />Anyway. I treat all vendors with a stoic professionalism when I contact them. I&#039;m here to build business relationships, not get really high and complain about losing BTC because I FEed. I suggest you folks do the same. If something doesn&#039;t &quot;feel&quot; right, choose another vendor. If you cannot find another vendor with acceptable prices, MESSAGE a vendor and try to work out a deal. If that fails, use the forums to ask for a service/product. If that fails, wait a month or two and try again. <br /><br />End.
