				stats look good! But past experience can be great HELP!! Some of the stats talk about edibles, i wish SR updates their review page to more specifics. Like what did the person order, and how long did it take.. ETC<br />vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/eebec90b41

				Just made a small order with MS. After reading about their mishaps, I found there are a few other herb/concentrate vendors also being attacked in the same way. <br /><br />Hopefully it&#039;s just assholes being assholes. I got faith in Martha.&nbsp; ;)

				i dunno, i flagged her! after they said they will post a a small listing because they couldn&#039;t meet my demand and then didn&#039;t. i message them back to ask about the smaller listing and no response. i messaged them again and yet no response. All i asked was a listing with no-FE.. so i dunno, i&#039;d be careful with them. I asked for a Pound they said they can&#039;t do it unless i FE, but they could do maybe a QP! So i said okay, to try your service and Buds I will order the NO FE QP! They said okay but never made a listing for that, after agreeing that they would. I messaged them a few time after that and no response!!! They were very responsive and quick too, answering my questions regarding me using them as my supplier, EAGER! But when it came down to NO FE, they just disappeared! Be careful with them

				I was just slandered pretty bad.&nbsp; Sucks because i just made everything overly right with a user to user refund.&nbsp; Then they revised multiple different orders feedback all at once.&nbsp; <br /><br />There should be a buyer feedback.&nbsp; Really.

				Update:<br /><br />Had to cancel. MS didn&#039;t ship out. They logged in for day, then gone the next. Just a little too sketchy to me...<br />Probably best to stay away until someone can get in comms with them.<br /><br />Now the good news: Placed an order with HS^ and it&#039;s already marked in transit within 2 hours of ordering! They are definitely on top of their shit.<br /><br />
