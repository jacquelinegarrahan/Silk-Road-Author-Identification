				I have been on SR for almost a year now but never got into the forums and lost my login details for the forum account I opened so here I am with new account and no posts......<br /><br />In the year odd I&#039;ve been on here I have always been super impressed with the eclectic range of items up for purchase from vendors.... Everything from a clue right through to documents etc.... Not many new ones pop up though and the range, although broad, has been what they are. Well today I found what is the most depraved and &#039;unique&#039; item that I have seen and its one I would never have guessed there was someone willing to actually list, sell and ship so I had to register just to get this info out there to the buying public;<br /><br />♡♡♡♡ Used Panties (getragene Höschen) ♡♡♡♡<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/90f91ba862<br /><br />The listing also details the &#039;pussy juice&#039; included and details the other offerings the vendor has up...<br /><br />I love it! One mans depravity is anothers special time spent alone and while not something I see real value in I&#039;de like to give a shout out to the person who actually purchased the item.. Yes thats right there is a feedback for the item. So well played sir/madam for the purchase but I also feel it necessary to ask why there was a &#039;leave feedback here&#039; review left... I mean there are some important things other potential buyers would undoubtedly like to know... Like just how strong and what colour was the pussy juice you received on the panties? was there any stealth in the packaging? haha important things to know while considering this purchase!<br /><br />Not cheap @ almost 2BTC given the exchange rate so spill... who are you and we want details on these things!! ;-)<br /><br />I loled and still am....<br /><br />
