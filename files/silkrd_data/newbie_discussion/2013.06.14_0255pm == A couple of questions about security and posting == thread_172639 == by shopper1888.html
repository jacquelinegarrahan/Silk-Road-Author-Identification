				<br /><br />My first question is:&nbsp; Is it dodgy to have a clearnet browser up on my computer at the same time as I have tor/SR up - I have not seen this question asked before although I am sure it must have been asked at some time.<br /><br />Hi,&nbsp; I have been a member for almost a year although I gave things a break after a few months last year.&nbsp; My first question is why can&#039;t I post in most, if not all of the other threads - there seems to be no option for it but I cannot remember that being the case last time.<br /><br />I actually have a 3rd question - I deleted my seller account last year after spending maybe 500 quid and a couple or so months on here, as I decided to give it a rest due to personal reasons.&nbsp; I also deleted my mtgox acct.&nbsp; I kind of regret it now since I have to go through the mtgox shit again but I thought it was the safest thing to do - just wondered what you members experienced in security issues think of that decision.&nbsp; My biggest regret is that I have to start as a newbie again&nbsp; and this hampers trust from some people when buying.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />shopper1875

				1 - I would say the biggest risk would be accidentally launching something in your clearnet browser that you meant to launch in Tor. Other than that, its not a biggy.<br /><br />2 - 50 posts in here, as verdant said. :)<br /><br />3 - Mt Gox is alive(ish), if you are prepared to jump through all their new hoops. There is a thread about some of the recent happenings at:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166907.0<br /><br />

				Thanks guys, I wonder what the brits are doing about getting coins now that mtgox is not so good.&nbsp; Also thanks for the link about mtgox - I will see if it is still viable for me.&nbsp; The last time I must say I got my coin within 24 hours on mtgox, my passport and whatever was verified almost straight away although I know that some people wait an age for verification and their cash.<br /><br />Man, it seems like a no brainer for some big company to set up the options they seem to have on other countries like the states.&nbsp; What is wrong with someone setting up a company that uses paypal for money exchanges. oh, well I won&#039;t get desperate like last year and get ripped for a hundred quid - man, that would be almost a grand now!<br /><br />Nice to be back after a good few months. :)<br />
