				it&#039;s always a bit slow. but read my post here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0 running a non-exit tor relay will help tor. the numbers of tor nodes in the last 7 years has grown VERY SLOWLY. look at this graph from the tor project website: https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=networksize&amp;start=2006-02-03&amp;end=2013-05-04#networksize if even 1/4 of all the SR users ran a 1mbit (800kb/s) capable tor relay, we would boost the tor network&#039;s capacity by 12% at least. That might be enough to make the attack on SR uneconomic. I am also suggesting (but i could be wrong) to increase your &#039;keep-alive timeout&#039; in your browser. the default is 300 seconds (5 minutes) but it might help to raise it much higher. I am testing a full hour (3600 seconds). and it seems to be helping me stay connected. Remember, if your connection stays open to the server, and you are not a scumbag scammer, then there is no way to boot you off except via your inactivity for longer than that period. Sure, the scum could try this tactic but then SR could restart their tor router and suddenly that introducer node is off the list. sure that would kick us off too, but if we are active through that period, we get back on, and lock out at least one connection from the scumbags that are trying to stop us getting on.
