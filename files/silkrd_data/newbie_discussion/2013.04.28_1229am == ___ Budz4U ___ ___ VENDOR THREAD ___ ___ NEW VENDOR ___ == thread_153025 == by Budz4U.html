				hey has anybody received yet from this vendor???&nbsp; i&#039;m a huge oilhead and seeing that microwave-extracted amber nectar on here finally has me drooling, but the listing kind of sketches me out because its basically a word-for-word pull from this page (including pic): (clearnet warning) http://thc-thehumboldtconnection.org/medicine-selection.html&nbsp; &nbsp;look at the bottom and you&#039;ll see the amber glass for sale there, and it seems like the vendor uses the same chart at the top for THC percentages too...&nbsp; <br /><br />i want to believe but this has me a little sketched out.&nbsp; maybe B4U can give some insight, i shot them a msg a couple days ago but well im not surprised they haven&#039;t even read it yet considering what poor SR has been going thru..&nbsp; also it&#039;d really really help to know that someone actually received and that what they received was quality and reflects the listing&#039;s description.&nbsp; <br /><br />i really like to give new vendors a chance, because i know how hard it can be to get started vending here esp if you&#039;re dealing in weed &amp; concentrates, this place has an abundance of cheap and shitty (as well as expensive and shitty) product so its tough to establish yourself as &#039;legit&#039; (i.e. you sell real medical for a real price).&nbsp; <br /><br />any info would be appreciated, thx yall

				thanks mcfly, gives me more confidence to order.. <br /><br />i think after seeing the strains people have bought and the listing on THC&#039;s site that B4U definitely is selling their wares (which is fuckin awesome, all of it looks amazinggg).&nbsp; if you want me to remove any references to THC here B4U please please let me know..&nbsp; i don&#039;t wanna put it on blast here if its something youd like to remain on the DL or if its an org that wouldn&#039;t want to get linked to SR, the last thing i&#039;d wanna do is fuck up your/their/whoevers biz somehow..&nbsp;

				Budz had good communication, very quick shipping, and high quality product. I received his lemon kush and sour skunk and was impressed with both.

				Even though Budz has his listings down at the moment, I just wanted to say that my transaction with him went very well. Budz had awesome communication allthroughout. When there was a minor mixup he went above and beyond to fix everything up right and had everything sorted within the week, plus extras to boot. The nugs smoke great and were a bangin&#039; deal!
