				I have 2.403btc locked up in SR right now. I also am a heavy investor and just created a small investment startup. On btcjam.com, i have a loan overdue in the amount of 1.8btc. This is negatively affecting my credit there and in turn will nearly wipe out any chances of borrowing in the future for capital expansion. <br /><br />I am willing to give someone my SR name/pw/pin to withdraw the 2.403 themselves after the site is available again, in turn for a 2.15btc loan. Basically youll make .25btc interest in a matter of days. Thats 1000%&#039;s in APR. <br /><br />Paying this loan is essential, it was due yesterday, but i told them to give me another day or so. <br /><br />My heart is aching, because i see my business going down the drains.<br /><br />I will take donations or loans. I know this is hard to believe, and i feel so vulnerable and disgusted with myself having to beg. <br /><br />17fTqG6q2HGhuP2jZPYSx46mU3c8bxWp2s is my sr input address showing the 2.403BTC goin in and then shuffled into a joint address within control of SR.<br /><br />I also created a blockchain.info account on the off chance anyone will work with me on this deal. I cant allow my credit to be ruined because of these hackers and their dos attack. ANYONE... PLEASE HELP ME GET THROUGH THIS. <br /><br />my sr account has 25 transactions, and 108btc spent! With 0 refunds, 0 autofinals, and have left 5/5 EVERYTIME.&nbsp; im loyal, hardworking, and honest. Worst case is that tomorrow i will have the funds outside of sr to repay. I just cant afford to wait as my credit depletes by the day... and minute. <br /><br />Sorry for the sob story. Go here to view my profile and see the proof that all i have said is true. <br /><br />https://btcjam.com/users/2706<br /><br />Anyone willing to accept my offer, msg me here.. or pm me. Time is ticking. THANK YOU ALL FOR READING. I HAVE TREMENDOUS FAITH IN THE COMMUNITY. PEACE BE WITH YOU ALL.

				Hello good day to you. I am a Nigerian Prince deposed from my country. I need only borrow 2.15 BTC to pay the wealth transfer tax on my 25,000 BTC in my account . If you give me the money to pay this fee, I will split the 25k with you. You make over 11,000 BTC! Super very good.<br /><br />

				I have $250. Haha. Thats not bitcoins. The loans are bitcoin loans, not cash.. you guys show your financial knowledge by suggesting that I just plug money in here and there regardless of its source. This is a legal business that requires bookeeping and regulatory controls. <br /><br />Thanks to the lendor for the lifesaving line of credit. We started up last month with less than 1btc investment. Today we have a 60btc capitalization. On the verge of issuing an IPO. I&#039;ve also increased securities from .5btc to 15btc. My coinlenders account draws 55% apr. So its all working fine. Because i run operations on a &quot;just in time&quot; idea and hold minimal debt, this caused issues with my payment. My D-PRIP (dividedend and profit reinvestment plan for the idiots), is ran at 96-97%. Cash reserves are minimal because of the nature of btcjam investments, btct.co, and mtgox currency trading. Liquidity will come when we go public with shares on btct.co in the coming weeks.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />-Bitcoins, Cash, and Collections LLC<br />Full profile and credit history on btcjam.com profile. <br />-Address verified.<br />-Identifications verified x3(social security card, military and state id)<br />-Paypal confirmed and verified. <br />-Phone number verified<br /><br />Moving forward with my business is my priority. Thanks again to the angel investor!! I knew there had to be a fellow btcjammer here!! Haha, didnt realize how &quot;close&quot; you were. You are right on too about the IQ of the posters above. <br /><br />To the fool who thinks that owning a business means you are rich.... it explains why you arent. And the other poster who portrayed me as offering millions for a small loan. You missed the decimal point. I offered a fraction of a bitcoin for 2 bitcoins. Just because no one trusts you, doesnt mean my credit has to suffer. This is my 10th loan, totaling close to $2000 THIS MONTH, FROM COMPLETE STRANGERS.&nbsp; The difference between you and I... i pay my debts. I also make profit from them. <br /><br />Life us good. Thanks SR for the help.
