				I copied this from someone on SR, i just thought it&nbsp; all sounded pretty good and wanted toi share this with those of you that havent already seen it.<br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />I am not brown, yellow nor white, I am not an american, egyption nor iranian, I am not a christian, buddhist nor muslim. I am me, I am free.<br /><br />☆☆ They call it the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe in it.<br />Don&#039;t let anyone including your government change the definition of freedom. The government does not grant rights, they are yours and inalienable regardless of where you live. Exercise your rights constantly, much like a muscle they become weak when not used. The government is in the business of eroding, removing and circumventing those rights and can only do so with your consent silent or otherwise.<br /><br />☆I will not be a slave, I will not live my life based on the morals, opinions, or whims of a church, a government, the majority, the minority or anyone else. Freedom!<br /><br />☆The US bill of rights is not a gift or granting of rights but a recognition of the rights you already have and to help you keep your government in check.<br /><br />THE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.<br /><br />☆ Why was the second bill of rights never made into law?<br /><br />Excerpt from President Roosevelt&#039;s January 11, 1944 message to the Congress of the United States on the State of the Union:<br />“ It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for the winning of a lasting peace and the establishment of an American standard of living higher than ever before known. We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth—is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.<br /><br />This Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights—among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and liberty.<br /><br />As our nation has grown in size and stature, however—as our industrial economy expanded—these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. “Necessitous men are not free men.”People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.<br />In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all—regardless of station, race, or creed.<br /><br />Among these are:<br />* The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;<br />* The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;<br />* The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;<br />* The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;<br />* The right of every family to a decent home;<br />* The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;<br />* The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;<br />* The right to a good education.<br /><br />All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.<br /><br />America&#039;s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens.<br /><br />For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.<br /><br />**Clear-net warning. Video of address. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwUL9tJmypI<br /><br /><br />Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights. Don&#039;t give up the fight. Now that you see the light, stand up for your rights. - Bob Marley<br /><br />A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.<br />Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity. - Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it. - Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. - Albert Einstein<br /><br />All the great things are simple, and many can be expressed in a single word: freedom, justice, honor, duty, mercy, hope. - Winston Churchill<br /><br />I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts. - Abraham Lincoln<br /><br />I am concerned for the security of our great Nation; not so much because of any threat from without, but because of the insidious forces working from within. - Douglas MacArthur<br /><br />Have you learned the lessons only of those who admired you, and were tender with you, and stood aside for you? Have you not learned great lessons from those who braced themselves against you, and disputed passage with you? - Walt Whitman<br /><br />The wise man does not expose himself needlessly to danger, since there are few things for which he cares sufficiently; but he is willing, in great crises, to give even his life - knowing that under certain conditions it is not worthwhile to live. - Aristotle<br /><br />Anarchism is the great liberator of man from the phantoms that have held him captive; it is the arbiter and pacifier of the two forces for individual and social harmony. - Emma Goldman<br /><br />The assertion that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great Britain and it was placed in the Declaration not for that, but for future use. - Abraham Lincoln<br /><br />A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep. - Saul Bellow<br /><br />We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office. - Aesop<br /><br />A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own, have rendered the great government of the United States helpless and contemptible. - Woodrow Wilson<br /><br />True patriotism hates injustice in its own land more than anywhere else. - Clarence Darrow<br /><br />Dissent is the highest form of patriotism. - Howard Zinn<br /><br />The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary. - H. L. Mencken<br /><br />Those who stand for nothing fall for anything. - Alexander Hamilton<br /><br />Only government can take perfectly good paper, cover it with perfectly good ink and make the combination worthless. - Milton Friedman<br /><br />Politics, it seems to me, for years, or all too long, has been concerned with right or left instead of right or wrong. - Richard Armour<br /><br />Free speech is not to be regulated like diseased cattle and impure butter. The audience that hissed yesterday may applaud today, even for the same performance. - William O. Douglas<br /><br />If we desire respect for the law, we must first make the law respectable. - Louis D. Brandeis<br /><br />I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no God. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. When the government fears the people, there is liberty. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />May we never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion. - Dwight D. Eisenhower<br /><br />No freeman shall be debarred the use of arms. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object of good government. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />When a man assumes a public trust he should consider himself a public property. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />It behooves every man who values liberty of conscience for himself, to resist invasions of it in the case of others: or their case may, by change of circumstances, become his own. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />The constitutions of most of our States assert that all power is inherent in the people; that... it is their right and duty to be at all times armed. - Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness. - Dalai Lama<br /><br />What is ominous is the ease with which some people go from saying that they don&#039;t like something to saying that the government should forbid it. When you go down that road, don&#039;t expect freedom to survive very long. - Thomas Sowell<br /><br />Political language... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. - George Orwell<br /><br />War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it. - George Orwell<br /><br />Firearms are second only to the Constitution in importance; they are the peoples&#039; liberty&#039;s teeth. - George Washington<br /><br />The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honor with all that&#039;s good. - George Washington<br /><br />The Constitution shall never be construed... to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms. - Samuel Adams<br /><br />It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon the supposition he may abuse it. - George Washington<br /><br />The problem in defense is how far you can go without destroying from within what you are trying to defend from without. - Dwight D. Eisenhower<br /><br />Ya&#039;ll take care now&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><br />ChemCat

				nm-<br /><br />Things aren&#039;t always created by way of thought.<br /><br />Does the process of evolution require thought?&nbsp; <br /><br />Does a tree require thought to grow?<br /><br />Nature definitely can&#039;t &quot;think&quot; in our definition of it, but it certainly gets a lot of shit done with it&#039;s dumb mind.
