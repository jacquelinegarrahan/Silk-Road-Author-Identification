				I am tossing this idea around in my very high mind right now.<br /><br />This will especially help newbies that have difficulty acquiring BTC&#039;s<br /><br />While I&#039;m not currently a vendor I am contemplating offering the following service...<br /><br />The concept is simple....<br /><br />You need BTC&#039;s...<br /><br />Go buy &gt;$---,---,--- In VISA/MasterCard/AmericanExpress, gift cards anonymously at ANY STORE.<br /><br />(We will use 100$ as our example)<br /><br />Make a order with me on SR for a $100 listing.<br /><br />You will send me all the information of the card digitally. ( I know this sounds sketchy, please keep reading! ;D)<br /><br />I will transfer the cash to my personal account.<br /><br />Within the day I will have your 100$ in BTC to your SR address, meaning yes, you can now buy drugs!<br /><br />I will take out a fee of course (undetermined/will depend on demand)<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a stockpile of BTC&#039;s or anything of the such I just have a VERY easy way to aquire them.<br /><br />To protect you as the customer, say for instance you need $1000 in BTC. Well, you can do each $100 of the $1000 individually, that way you won&#039;t have to send any more $ until the first $100 in BTC is funded!<br /><br />We can even break the $100 orders down into 1/4 $25 orders, You send me the 25$ GC, You get your BTC, Rinse Repeat! I would even consider doing this until a rep is established!<br /><br />I hate to see all these people getting ripped off, scammed, and stolen from every day. When it&#039;s just a 15min ordeal for me. So why not spread the love.<br /><br />Any critics are welcome as I so far see no flaws in my plans, I don&#039;t even need customer info!<br /><br />Thanks for viewing all! <br /><br />If interested PM me or post here so I can work on getting a vendor account!

				Money will not be laundered in any way.<br /><br />&nbsp;Everything is completely legal in the process.<br /><br />Taxes are paid for their prepaid card.<br /><br />You are offering it as a gift to me for non-tangible goods, therefore they are not physically receiving anything.<br /><br />&amp; I think we all know how BTC&#039;s anonymity works....<br /><br />As for me converting it from PrePaid card form into Usable USD in my bank account, that is my own secret that I do not wish to disclose.<br /><br />(Also not illegal)
