				Pretty good &quot;ice&quot;. It is methamphetamine but it comes in powder form. It is still very strong! <br /><br />Fast shipping and friendly buyer.<br /><br />If you like mamp, you won&#039;t be disappointed with this seller.

				&nbsp;:) ;D :D<br />as a person who rather fancies a bit of gofast, i indeed have at least a couple decades of experience under my belt dabbling, and yes, more often than never, binging on chemicals from the amphetamine family, all varieties, analogues, derivitaves, from all -groups, with the focus being on meth, so please take that into account when i say that this meth is the fuckin beez knees. who would have thought the stuff that comes in powder form is some 10/10 would bang! i havent even had that much yet and still on a 1-10 scale i rate this shit fucking BANANAS! it easily beats out all the locally produced shit i deal with, and at a decent price, too.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				How unfortunate that the best meth on SR is perhaps one of the most underrated. After reading the reviews stating that Bulk Cain&#039;s meth is mostly powder it quickly got my attention since the best meth I&#039;ve tried almost 20 years ago was in the powder form,&nbsp; I was not disappointed. Since I now only do meth twice a year, this time I decided to order from the top 4 vendors with the best quality reviews. Was not surprised nor impressed in the substandard quality of their meth, mostly re-crystallized shards, but overall bunk.<br /><br />To give credit where credit is due, a year ago there was an SR vendor named heisemburg who consistently sold a superior meth product.<br /><br />In the meantime, I wish Bulk Cain continue success, and hope that people especially n00bies finally wake up and experience the effects of a superior quality meth.
