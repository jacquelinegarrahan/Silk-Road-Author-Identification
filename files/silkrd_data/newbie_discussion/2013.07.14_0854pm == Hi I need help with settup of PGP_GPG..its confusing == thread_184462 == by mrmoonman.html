				I have GPG and kleopatra for windows. (also knows as gpg4win.) but I can&#039;t figure out how to make my key and how to use it correctly. Anyone with some extra time that feels like giving some help to a noob would be very helpful. PM or post here if you like.

				Hey Mr. Moonman, <br /><br />This is going to be a long post, but it should get you started.... <br /><br />1.&nbsp; Go to&nbsp; &lt;http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html&gt; and click the download button. <br />2.&nbsp; Once downloaded, open the &lt;gpg4win-2.1.1.exe&gt; file and click install. Also, during the install process, you will be asked what folder to save it to, as well as to select/check the boxes of what you want installed.&nbsp; Leave the boxes checked that are already checked by default, and also check the box next to &quot;GPA.&quot;&nbsp; I think you click a &quot;next&quot; button or something similar after that.<br />3. Once installed, it will ask you where you want shortcut icons placed. <br />4. If it doesn&#039;t open automatically after being installed, go ahead and open it.&nbsp; I cant remember if by default it automatically creates a key for you, so lets pretend like it doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the button on the top menu bar that says &quot;Keys&quot;, the click &quot;New Key&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; After selecting new key, it will prompt you for your name (you don&#039;t have to use your real name, most people use their SR names).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; After typing your name, you will be asked for an email address, and then a password/passcode.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Once finished entering your password, it will generate your new Key (I save it as a notepad file).&nbsp; Save this somewhere that you won&#039;t forget.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Once you have your new key, you are ready to encrypt/decrypt messages. <br />6.&nbsp; Click the button on the top menu bar that says &quot;Clipboard.&quot;&nbsp; This will open a new window.&nbsp; This is where you type and/or copy &amp; paste messages into that you want to encrypt. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Once you&#039;ve typed in practice message and are ready to encrypt, you will click the button on the top Clipboard menu bar that says&nbsp; &quot;Encrypt.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Once you click the Encrypt button, a window of keys will pop up (your key and all of the keys that you&#039;ve imported...... but at this point it will only<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; show your key since you haven&#039;t imported any yet...... I&#039;ll get to that in a minute)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Choose the key that you would like to encrypt the message with.&nbsp; Since you haven&#039;t imported any other keys yet, select your own key for<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;practice.&nbsp; &nbsp;(However, once you do import other keys, remember that only the person who has the password to the key that you select will be able<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to &quot;Decrypt&quot; and read the message)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; After this you will see that your message has now become encrypted....... <br /><br /><br />IMPORTING KEYS<br /><br />To import keys from other people (usually you&#039;ll be getting vendors keys so you can encrypt your address with them).<br /><br />I&#039;ve listed my public key at the bottom of the following instructions for you to use for practice... (Also there is an entire discussion on PGPs that Scout started.... Which is also where I learned this)<br /><br />1. Copy the public key that you wish to import.&nbsp; (Make sure you begin copying at the beginning of the &quot;-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&quot; and copy until the very end of &quot;-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&quot;<br /><br />2. Once copied (Most vendors who use PGP have their key&#039;s listed on their profile pages), go back and click the &quot;Edit&quot; button on the top menu bar, then select &quot;Paste&quot; from the dropdown menu.&nbsp; Once you Click &quot;Paste&quot; the program automatically imports the key that you had copied.&nbsp; (Please note that you will not actually paste the key anywhere.&nbsp; You&#039;re just selecting paste from the &quot;edit&quot; menu)<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Now you have just added a key to files, and you can now encrypt messages with it. (Again, please remember that only the person who the key belongs to and/or whoever has the password to that key will be able to decrypt the message)<br /><br />I hope this helps.....&nbsp; I know this shit can be a little nerve racking...<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.20 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFHhxqEBCACvCQph3SmivnAO6v9j0VPcY+tdsucE6vZsk3ThAE6yQeOgjyRy<br />A5N1NnxHVwMuUvEr/PhqYoG3xi9JZmPGQOckR/Bbhbg0MMaoJKzyWCJqFVPIeTMZ<br />0qxdWXDxM2baA4DetQonKdS8+4CyLyQFAyO3jidV+sAlLf2MHdknF+HCAlvet19X<br />/tL0r9zF0Uki9s+9L8sjR6/NP8h8NQ153zc3FZkCR4WOe6WIatIgwnjk5pRR3W/A<br />J41y1KMuB04cWpX1vKUL08PsvGpa99Uufonfq2lK+ZYsHImfGXRl4Za7uSf4Xwxu<br />WzEqLfM6lul7tWt4dIePHYLAMMKWBlychRx5ABEBAAG0IEphY2sgRG9lIDxqYWNr<br />RG9lMTNAdG9ybWFpbC5vcmc+iQE5BBMBAgAjBQJR4cahAhsDBwsJCAcDAgEGFQgC<br />CQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQcTqgoP5OJaPioAf/VqO+gZ1zpEN1WETp4ipiLflo<br />XCBQRLF9S4ooV9mRLlDFY62H63YxRYHrOpU9BCsuIuEO3PTHYp3Ydi156LS6pEkB<br />uCvmdU0N33XKjGiU3UUC4lSS+CVbzU6tKEFikpy8ZgOUKMEWmAKI0VwAsd9au3lY<br />aHqMSnjfBVrK3MHW11IufivHcKYW8VeRWwaoMSGtpqYnvaLeBTeXqgpJxLU1f8N4<br />SWwIorBVV6VMC6jxUU3DnqoMA7c2lhAOPuryHYZIgjjUc1akRWybU7QFUWhxLonE<br />9mr3zR+0rKnXGdO7I2nNMB8pcvL29foaN60/qrYOy4IIjnKa7W+Zra6+aAe5ubkB<br />DQRR4cahAQgA+G+3nMr19TAZBgne466sprYpNzU4DaPomjKtPNtzp4CaJ7uRdTEq<br />BjFA91ep1mmQlpOEGe+5vt5wg9IOIDDg8yF+gxn9vGND+Djih2MRTIhtyxPOG0+I<br />2f96XBNBkwresvdNIeUQHy3xFldaRUF+IJkx/VPkyJpO3Cowp5u6ndeXnICoYweE<br />vX0vbK49smGN4d0eJmo7umzh+CB8o2WD6RbVwXm1LJRm0CV+A9RpUavPdhl75LfR<br />I+IwKf/8lfckxf41DuV9AeVCdvGkCn9Y6gERabCFxvohTuc1hU9oPYa5NIxwP46d<br />50+durShzIh1y0Ku5AlrX0QrDSggqWSXdwARAQABiQEfBBgBAgAJBQJR4cahAhsM<br />AAoJEHE6oKD+TiWjraUH/14LPTLzNe8d3yLh74ANmv+4hE2870eIMWJGauu+a5Iv<br />c9OzRw3YaEdxq81nqugLOprvhnpi3ZiDVKpqppfDhS9unPRGp2nuYZr2SeU98CPc<br />oQyapT0IPCmO55upeQSadwbt+U2W/wurRsHS6PBBfk8DHbyVmls0iYvfZzg33Jkq<br />ePguvgrt9jxt1xVBsApUZ9MIMB5949LwXj7vRW3bI1eKz+CfkLbY5F6jPrp+1qu1<br />Zt32ilxUEPsg2VnZIig6frJq9ERDlRUY4dhIdjfAJjVLlCQizQH1YY7fSJs4g8+6<br />1OOCrZoaEwr4alzQuvBdln/wl95v+K6z1MmM61d7KsU=<br />=W7V1<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

				Is there a program equivalent to that for Linux, or does that program have Linux functionality? I could check but I&#039;d rather contribute to the message board economy.

				There is definitely a Linux equivalent.&nbsp; If you compare PGP message and/or key blocks on the msg boards, you&#039;ll notice that some (like mine) begin with:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.20 (MingW32)<br /><br />While others begin with the same thing, but the &quot;(MingW32)&quot; will be replaced with Linux <br />

				I have a question on this subject. If I have items from multiple vendors in my cart, I can add each recipient&#039;s public key to my address encryption. The resulting encryption will be created in such a way that each of the multiple vendors will be able to unencrypt, is that correct? Thanks.

				I&#039;m sorry, but I don&#039;t know the answer to that one.... To be safe, I&#039;d do one of two things.<br /><br />1. Make separate orders instead of adding all to the same cart.<br /><br />2. When you list your encrypted address in the address box, list it several times (One for each vendor) and label each one such as:<br /><br />Vendor 1 Address encryption (Where vendor 1 is the name of vendor whose key you used to encrypt it)<br /><br />Vendor 2 Address Encryption&nbsp; (Where vendor 1 is the name of vendor whose key you used to encrypt it)<br /><br />ETC....<br /><br />this way the vendors won&#039;t try to decrypt the wrong messages....<br /><br />

Anyway, I finally got it figured out and I think you should just make a separate order for each different vendor you use. Really, whats it take to place and order? 90 seconds maybe? You can only encrypt your addy with 1 vendors key at a time, so if your ordering from 4 vendors, your gonna havta encrypt your addy 4 times anyway.
