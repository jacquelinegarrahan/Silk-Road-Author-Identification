				Kingoftheroundtable who also goes by roundtable knight and most likely a couple other names is a scam buyer.&nbsp; He claimed he did not get a package I sent, not knowing that I had tracking on the package!&nbsp; When I alerted him that the package was marked as delivered and that he should check with fam or roommates he then claimed that it was not his address!&nbsp; I am a new vendor here but all my packs have been delivered,&nbsp; you can check any of the buyers who have done business with me.&nbsp; This scammer is not coming at my lively-hood and threatening to change his feedback.&nbsp; Once again another case of buyers having an un-proportional amount of protection over sellers.&nbsp; Its all good I don&#039;t sweat a hater, the shop is still open!! All reputable buyers still welcome!!

				This is exactly what I have been saying to admin, the protection for buyers far outweighs that for sellers.&nbsp; One scammer ain&#039;t gonna stop the spot though.&nbsp; I hope he enjoys the free g, cause his business is no longer welcomed.&nbsp; Was it worth it?&nbsp; I&#039;m still rollin up the good weed.&nbsp; Peace

				I&#039;m not tryna bully u man Fuck thirty dollars idgaf abt that I&#039;ve made that back almost just from havin my coins sit in my account, the only reason I&#039;m doing any of this is cause u called me the scammer... After you said u sent me the wrong tracking number to expose me... But didn&#039;t say to expose me what for lol and yea u comment on a few topics but your no hero member or big vendor here you say your new say that ur legit but I don&#039;t buy it. honestly I think that if anyone was Le it&#039;s you... why send me a sample out side of the silkroad system u basically gave me one and said the other would arrive in the mail after that... When I first spoke to you you told me I&#039;d reviceve sour d and skywalker cause hawiiain was out but you still had 7g listing of Hawaiian up and none of Skywalker at all.. and then message me saying that the Hawaiian sample is in the mail and don&#039;t even give me a chance to decline before your shipment when you tell me that I&#039;ll get it after I received the first g. and then I&#039;ve gotten packages from other vendors left feedback and never had one complaint until you. I&#039;m sure you couldn&#039;t say the same abt me... But anyways good luck with trying to convince your few if any fans or followers believe that I&#039;m tryna scam you... for a gram... That you offered to me... lol
