				I am new to SR and have placed three orders to start out. <br /><br />My first order was from PureOrganx where I got 2 grams of Raspberry Kush, 1 gram of Chocolate Chunk Hash, and a free half gram of Blackberry Kush hash. The stealth was amazing on this package to start off. Once I got to the goods, I was amazed. I enjoyed the freebie more than the one I ordered though, it was super nice. The weed was very nice also. Shipping took 4 days and was too expensive, TBH. I would order from him again, and actually tried to, but he decided to not respond to my messages asking for another custom order. Which lead me to purchase from the next two vendors instead.<br /><br />My second order was from GreenOvenDoor where I got a gram of their CO2 Northern Lights honey oil. I don&#039;t have my vape just yet due to a snafu with the place I ordred one from, but I did put some on a joint so I could try it out. Very nice. Stealth on packaging was good too. Was nervous about FE&#039;ing for free shipping but didn&#039;t need to be. Will order from this vendor again.<br /><br />My third order was from Coagulator for 1/4th of his Pineapple Express bud. I placed the order this past Sunday and was just informed this morning that there was a big problem and my order as well as several others have been delayed a week. Why it took them 5 days after marking it shipped to contact me, I have no idea. They let me know that they should have them out on Monday and let me know I could get a refund if I wanted. I do not want a refund, I just want my bud. I am a little upset that I&#039;ve paid for priority shipping and here it is 5 days later and no bud. However, I&#039;m not going to bad mouth them because I have no idea what they will send me yet and if they send me a bit extra, I will forgive the snafu. Hopefully whatever is troubling them will make way for easier orders in the future.<br /><br />Before placing my second order, I tried to place an order with Retinablast for some of his tincture. Woke up the next day with a message that my order had been cancelled without explanation. I messaged him twice with no response. Great way to do business. Hope you never need new customers, because I sure as hell will not mess with you again if you cannot bother to answer me. I don&#039;t believe in giving my hard earned money to vendors who think they are too good to speak to customers.
