				If you like smart and witty hip-hop , try Cool Calm Pete and his older stuff under Babbletron. I know it sounds weird to say to trip to rap , but his music so light and wispy and his flow is so laid back , you just get kinda sucked in.

				My Morning Jacket, Dada Life, Bassnectar, Adventure Club, The Beatles, Knife Party, DJ Fresh. I could keep goin but to put it simply, I mainly prefer dubstup or lighter EDM because the pitches in the music is meant to hit your eyes a specific way to make you trip and/ or roll harder because when you&#039;re under the influence of Ecstasy and acid or any of its research chem forms your ears don&#039;t exactly know how to register it properly. The only way I can think to describe what it&#039;s like for me is that it feels sort of like my ears pop and my mind just constantly keeps resetting itself. It&#039;s a pretty awesome feeling.

				you guys have posted some good ones, wanna bump your Bassnectar, Pretty Lights, and Ratatat suggestions, good ones there<br /><br />here&#039;s one that hasn&#039;t been listed and its a hardcore throwback but i enjoyed it, Nightmares On Wax, least two of the releases are classics in my mind that will outlive time.<br /><br />And if you like Trip-Hop that&#039;s slightly lounge then I say look up Fat Jon the Ample Soul Physician along with a Japanese DJ name Seba Jun his musician&#039;s name was Nujabes(his name backwards)<br /><br />Think you guys would enjoy those artists

				Literally all music is good or at least cool while tripping. <br /><br />For some real &quot;trippy&quot; shit, go with IDM like boards of canada, aphex twin, or amon tobin. <br /><br />Bassnectar and Pretty Lights are great suggestions. I would also throw in seeing jam bands like Phish or Disco biscuits, and of course Pink Floyd
