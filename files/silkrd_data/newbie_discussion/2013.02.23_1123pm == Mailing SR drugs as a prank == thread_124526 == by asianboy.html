				It sounds like a waste of money and drugs, haha. Plus, I&#039;m sure that most vendors wouldn&#039;t want their time or product wasted, and would cancel your order when they saw the address of a police station/school in the delivery box!

				It would have to be very carefully coordinated. I expect it would be a huge waste of money though. The fun of a prank is the reaction, and I&#039;m not sure how you&#039;d see the reaction unless you live with them. I guess it would be funny to see my girlfriend open an ounce of crack and wonder where the hell it came from, but would be very expensive.

				To be honest, I have never heard of such a childish or foolish act to do in all my time on SR.<br /><br />What exactly do you find amusing about it or hope to achieve ?<br />Why would you want to endanger SR and its vendors ?<br />A fucking school ??? Are you real ???<br /><br />I think you need to grow up a little. <br />No offense....

				Is there not enough hatred for people selling drugs to people who want it? Now we want the news reporting that drug dealers are mailing drugs to little kids? Sounds like a grand idea...

				as a prank, sure why not as long as the recipient can understand the humor in it. But c&#039;mon, for real, an elementry shool ? maybe its just me and im missing the &#039;fun&#039; part of it or me being a tightass mfka but please, please sometime stop and considered why people have such a negative view on drug users in genereal and maybe, just maybe one day it might be possible not to get labeled as scum of the earth worst criminal in the history of time, the worst of the worst, an outcast of the society just because i choose to do drugs every now and then.<br />take it fwiw...<br /><br />pz<br /><br />-em
