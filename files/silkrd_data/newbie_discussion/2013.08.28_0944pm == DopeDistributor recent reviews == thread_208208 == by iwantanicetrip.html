				ordered of him on the 11th of September. the order was marked in transit within an hour, then i got a message telling me it would be KIND to F.E -- i replied with a message pointing out that this was against sr rules and i would not fe early for any vendor, if dd was unhappy with this he could cancel my order and i would order from one of my regular vendors. 15 days later and i have received nothing. and his account has been deleted. there were loads of people leaving feed back on his account saying fe for trusted vendor due to his 5/5 rating. hopefully i will get a refund from sr as i stayed in escrow but i think a lot of people will have lost money to him.<br /><br />we have a great community here, with some fantastic and honest vendors. but unfortunately we have these scam artists too. <br />reading some older posts it looks like he may have done this before. so how he had such a good rating i don&#039;t know. guess its cause of people leaving a 5 rating with just fe as a comment.<br /><br />if a vendor can offer 1kg for sale he shouldn&#039;t be asking f.e on a gram.<br /><br />please refuse to f.e for any vendor<br /><br />now i just have to wait and see if sr really do protect their customers in escrow. fingers crossed<br /><br />
