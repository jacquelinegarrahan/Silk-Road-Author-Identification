				Are drugs your first purchase? Most vendors I come across (the big ones on the SR front page) insist on 10 orders etc. I figured we&#039;d have to buy random shit like books and herbs to get that purchase history.

				I remember my first purchase. I bought domestically despite the higher prices just to get a transaction under my belt. I would run home from work each day and check my mailbox. It was so exciting when the package arrived. I felt like I was now empowered with a gift that is so wonderful. I no longer had to rely on the shitty dealers in my home town to score my fun time substances.

So far over 60 transactions and over $3.5k spent, never finalized early, and I doubt I will any time soon. It&#039;s just something I&#039;m not comfortable with. I will consider FEing if DCN/tracking is involved, but even then you don&#039;t know for sure it&#039;s being sent to your address. I once spent my evening (being impatient as ever) checking tracking, seeing it was at a post office not far from my city, then found out later that it was the wrong tracking. If I had FE&#039;d, I would have immediately thought I was getting played, but it was still in escrow and knew it was just a harmless mistake.
