				They have both scammed people with the counterfeit pink adderall. They claim they are legit generics but they contain non of the real ingredients. They refuse to make it right. Be Careful and report scammers!

				Thanks for the heads up.<br /><br />Agree all scammers should be immediately reported including FE pushers.<br /><br />The site was designed on respect and trust...... veering off the path paved by Silk Road mastermind &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; just spells doom.
