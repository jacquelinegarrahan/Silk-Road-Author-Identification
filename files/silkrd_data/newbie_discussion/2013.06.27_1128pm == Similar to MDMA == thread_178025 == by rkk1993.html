				I know there is nothing like the magic you feel with MDMA, but what drug makes you feel almost like a MDMA roll. I want something different first because I dont like takeing the same drug more than twice in a month. and second is the price of good MDMA is so high for me to do very often.

				Hi rkk1993,<br /><br />Not really answering your question, but there IS nothing like MDMA. Seems to me from trip reports of analogues/similar drugs to the really big ones that when people try substitutes they end up having an awareness of the differences or failings rather than being lost in enjoyment. Sometimes nature/chemistry gets it just right - MDMA, LSD, psylocybin, hash, you get the picture. <br /><br />Like you can&#039;t get a vegetarian version of a great roast chicken. Know what I mean?&nbsp; <br /><br />But others may have other ideas, and I have had a couple o&#039; beers.<br /><br />Take care.

				Thats what ive read also. And the second time I tried something sold to me as MDMA i knew immedietly it was not. Im guessing it was mephedrone by reports. But in my opinion i actually prefer 25i to lsd and ive heard that 4-aco-dmt is better than mushrooms(but in my case I dislike mushrooms anyway).

				You could try &#039;MDA&#039; it&#039;s rumored to be what real ecstasy. BUT this would not really help with you&#039;re taking different drugs once each a month as it is so similar. You want to research the negative/side effects of MDMA, for instance what organs it affects and compare them with the affects of other drugs. Only then you can make a choice as to what to take to give you&#039;re body a break.<br /><br />Personally for me it&#039;s more like never do the same type of drugs 2 nights in a row... I&#039;m obviously thinking of a festival-type scenario. Drink one night, Roll another, Trip the next - although for me this is more because I don&#039;t seem to get the same buzz on the trot.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br />Be Good.<br /><br />

The best way I can describe it is like an orgasm while tripping on 25i. I enjoy it but its more expensive which is one reason I dont want it. and MDA does not let me move hardly i always have to lay down. if i want somethng close to MDA it would be 2cb at a 15-18mg dose.<br /><br />I know what ur saying about spreading things out I really dont do more drugs than drink but possibly 1-2 times a month.

I liked it the first time. But then the next two were just to disosiative and not fun and I experienced things I really just didn&#039;t want to. Not saying I won&#039;t ever do them again I just need to be by myself and a time in my life I feel is right. There are other things I&#039;d rather do includeing 25i for example. Which makes me really happy on it and a couple days after as shrooms leaves me down and emotionless for a week.
