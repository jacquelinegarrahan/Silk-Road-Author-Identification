				There&#039;s music without drugs but no drugs without music. Music is my life. I listen to music every day. Do we have other music fanatics here?<br /><br />I really like 70&#039;s rock like Deep Purple, Rainbow, Rush, Black Sabbath and so on. But above all is The God of Rock &#039;n Roll,&nbsp; Lemmy The Fuckin Kilmister! The only man that will literally someday die with the boots on. And on stage. Or actually he&#039;ll never die, cause he&#039;s The God!<br /><br />And he had used speed over 20 years and never addicted to it! Haha.. there&#039;s something funny in that sentence ;)<br /><br />~Q~

				I don&#039;t think i could live without music and I know i definitely couldn&#039;t take drugs without music!!<br /><br />I would prefer listen to music over any other media!! I live for music!!<br /><br />I&#039;m very open to what music i will listen to and make my judgement on weather i like it or not based on individual songs, I will not restrict myself to one or two genres like so many others do!!<br /><br />My music collection of 30,000 songs ranges across a broad spectrum from metal to drum and bass and pretty much all other genres in between!!

				Alright! Nice to hear. I&#039;m old school, so I have something like 2000+ CD&#039;s. Well, semi-oldschool some might say, because I have CD&#039;s not LP&#039;s. Actually I have also LP&#039;s, one big pile of a human size from Led Zeppelin to Top Gun Soundtrack. And of course I&#039;m also into digital media because CD&#039;s will die, that&#039;s for sure. <br /><br />Long live good music!<br /><br />~Q~

				I don&#039;t think there was a song sang or written in the 70&#039;s that didn&#039;t involve drugs of some kind. Some great bands mentioned there, loved them. Thin Lizzy, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix Experience, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, this is a list that goes on and on and on. <br /><br />Nowadays I love chillout during a good stone session. Jakatta, William Orbit, The Orb, Groove Armada. Again, all music that couldn&#039;t exist without the influence of drugs.
