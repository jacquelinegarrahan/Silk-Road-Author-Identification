				That&#039;s what stealth mode is, mate. The profile page disappears and you can only message him. Why don&#039;t you ask your vendor?

As for Fedex, very dangerous to ship illegal items through private carriers. They can open at will, no warrant, no probable cause. Also I highly doubt there is overnight service from US to AUS.

				most likely his vendor account has been banned. probably for asking for sketchy as hell payment outside escrow. he sounds like a complete idiot but the fact that you are still considering sending cash to him post-ban doesn&#039;t say much about your instincts and common sense ::)<br />i can tell you for a fact that is definitely not stealth. in stealth mode vendors keep their vendor page, status and listings, they just don&#039;t appear in public searches.

				Uh, do NOT send him cash in the mail for drugs!&nbsp; That defeats the entire purpose of SR and its escrow system!&nbsp; Also, if their account was banned, there is likely a very good reason for it!&nbsp; If you get scammed, SR will not be able to help you at all.

				fucking hell is mtljohn still at it? this is the most special needs thread i&#039;ve seen. what part of this situation is giving you any level of trust whatsoever? a vendor has been banned, has given you an address he says is his home, wants you to mail cash to him despite having his account banned and says he&#039;ll send you product no worries... honestly, there&#039;s just no helping some people. wtf do they put in the water in australia?!
