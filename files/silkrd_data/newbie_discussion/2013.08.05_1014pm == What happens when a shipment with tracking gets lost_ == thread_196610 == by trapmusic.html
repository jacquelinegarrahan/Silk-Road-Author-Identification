				As the headline says, what happens when a shipment with tracking gets lost? do they write on the tracking webpage something like &#039;we do not support your illegal activity&#039; or whats gonna happen? is it possible that they would also just write that theyve sended it or does it always show that the package was confiscated?<br />thank you

				Generally, the last placed it was scanned before it got seized will be the last entry on the tracking log. <br /><br />With an overseas order, it will indicate it is in customs forever.<br /><br />Domestic, it will show the last post office or mail hub that scanned it before seizure<br />

				nothing happens i&#039;ve had several lost, i use my real name, the vendor reships if he tracks it and never says delivered, then people panic on the forums, new vendors get more nervous, and SR stays the same oddly enough

				i&#039;ve been waiting on an express package for 8 days now. the vendor gave me the wrong tracking numbers, and hasn&#039;t gotten back to me with the right ones. i don&#039;t think i&#039;m being scammed but without the tracking numbers, is there any way of getting info on the package from the post office?

				Unfortunately it sounds like you&#039;re being scammed, and no I&#039;m fairly sure there is no way for the post office to tell you how far away the package is.

				I think as a rule of thumb i would suggest using a real or legit address.<br />international orders may be cheaper but the risk seems to be not worth the savings..<br />I wouldn&#039;t want anything to do with customs if i didn&#039;t have to.<br />just a thought.

				Hello guys!<br /><br />Rule Number one! If costums get the parcel/letter ah refund is ten times better (not always) than ah reship, BUT.....(read the other rest)<br />I am here since 2 years!<br /><br />If you want to test if your mailbox is flagged or you are paranoid to order something again, let me know, i ship something to you, only something that looks like ah drug but in real these are only vitamin pills, or i can ship sugar , whatever you want! Or something which looks like weed and only is some tea!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I do this for FREE*, you only have to pay the *shipping costs! You decide with tracking or without, and what should be inside the parcel, and how should the letter/parcel look from outside and so on! You can give me every detail you want and i do it for you, as i mentioned before, i only take for this service the shipping costs not less and not more! If you choose tracking you also get the tracking number (use the tracking number only on normal web browser, not in TOR)<br /><br />Last year i ordered 200 Pills Blisterpacked, costum&#039;s get it! First i thought the vendor never shipped it and i called him bitch etc.....<br />So he says don&#039;t worry i reship it, costums got it again! So i have learned ah lot about the postal system and costum how they work!<br />Because of so much post which every day goes on their table they often only take parcels/letters which are sent from outside EU to inside EU! So i make ah list:<br /><br />1)Outside EU to inside EU are nearly every 50th bigger parcel gets threw the x-ray! Some Letters which are cramful only touched for ah few seconds no more, i know that because some person i know very good works for EU costums! They also told me this things , at least he always said to me, if i tell this to somebody&nbsp; else he loose his job....but i think when i write this here in ah &quot;anonymous&quot; forum i didn&#039;t lied!<br /><br />2) If you reship ah parcel for example from America to Germany and costums get it, there are two types (Drugs or medication) If this are medication you get ah letter directly from costums where you only could write on it that you have done something false and you need for this medication from ah doctorr in your country ah prescription, if you not bring this within 14 days we ship this to the police and they are making the next steps, i don&#039;t say the whole story because i don&#039;t want that something which could be know this case, know who i am in real!( BUT if the found 1000 pills there is no way to go to doctor and ask for ah recipe, i only did it one time with 2 xanax blister&#039;s that i go to my doctor which is ah really good person and he told me he never do it again, but he does it and i get my stuff)<br />So we learn about it, if costums get ah parcel (it was ah bubble envelope with 150 benzo&#039;s blisterpacked) and the vendor reship , it is very possible(70%) that the costums&nbsp; get the second parcel too(could be that the same costum worker get this in his hands), because everything is the same, your address, the outside of the package, (the product), maybe the return address, the noise when you shake and when you touch the same feeling and so on! So they just take ah look on the computer, enter your name and saw that 1 month ago ah parcel was seized! And seized products with drugs/medication inside are always photographed and saved on the computer! This files(photos) are also viewable for the police!<br /><br />If you can choose between ah 100% reship or 50% refund, i would take the refund (only if the buyer don&#039;t is ah scammer, scammers should go to hell)!<br />And if you buy something about 2000€ or more, i would ask the vendor FIRST to ship them ah Fake envelope with tracking and the vendor should look that the parcel looks like the seized parcel from the outside, and the inside you make tricky, you put something in it, Reason: when the parcel opened that the buyer know somebody have it opened(costums often open parcel and clue it normal together without the stamp: opened by customs office! Than you know you are safer and can choose the reship! I takes long time i know, but what do you prefer, this what you ordered or talk hours and hours with the police and get ah punishment at the end!<br /><br />3) NEVER look at the Tracking Number if you BROWSE WITH TOR, only Clearnet to look for the tracking number, and don&#039;t look everyday, just look only if you not get the parcel, or after 10 days when status is &quot;shipped, BUT NOT IN TOR! IF you do that, you have ah 50/50 chance that your order arrive!<br /><br />4) If you live in EU, don&#039;t order from 3rd world countries! Costums proof bigger parcel&#039;s also for meat, and products which could be infected with some virus...........I prefer to order only EU to EU, it is safer!<br /><br />For fake deliveries just pm me! I also have ah account on the road, it is safer to give me their the details but first contact me here!<br /><br /><br />Sorry for my english, my mothers speak is not english, if you want i can translate it in two other languages!<br /><br />Regards Diamond<br /><br /><br />BTW: I have ah question, how can i make some verdict/sentence which is in every answer or topic i give at the end, where are this option?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I see often people they have their Road stats their, how many orders and spent total and so on! Can somebody help me where i&nbsp; could&nbsp; &nbsp;do this?? Thanks<br /><br />

				if it&#039;s lost then tracking would just show when it was last tracked.<br /><br />there would be no update indicating it&#039;s lost.&nbsp; the lack of updates would be the indication that it&#039;s lost.
