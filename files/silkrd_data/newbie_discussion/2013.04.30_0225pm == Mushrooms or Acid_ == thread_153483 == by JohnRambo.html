				I&#039;ve done both, and I found that mushrooms are a much more natural high, and they give you a feeling of bliss and contentment. Whereas acid feels very artificial, like a chemical high, and doesn&#039;t automatically bring feelings of bliss and happiness like mushrooms do.<br /><br />Do you prefer mushrooms or acid? And why?

				Well, genuine LSD is harder to obtain than genuine Shrooms, even the LSD on SR is suspect.<br /><br />But personally, I prefer genuine acid, it&#039;s just so... &quot;open&quot;. Hard to describe why really, psychedelics have very subjective effects.

				I Choose Mushrooms all day. Acid for me is more of a mind fuck. I feel sober, and extremely high at the same time. I also Feel Wired when on acid like im on an upper. While mushrooms I just Feel High, and blissful. There are times when on mushrooms the trip gets intense, but with experience you&#039;ll learn to love the in tenseness. All in All at the end of a acid trip i feel like i changed, while at the end of a mushroom trip i feel like i&#039;ve grown. <br /><br />

				Man, I hate that &quot;natural feel&quot; bullshit. It only &quot;feels natural&quot; to you because you expect it to. It&#039;s all psychosomatic. Psilocin metabolized from psilocybin in mushrooms is the same as if I were to give you synthetic psilocin. Also, acid is usually not &quot;artificial.&quot; It is extracted from ergoline alkaloids in the ergot fungus the majority of the time, and that&#039;s the method that gives the cleanest, purest LSD, IMO. So, it too is the product of natural biochemical processes, and is just as &quot;natural&quot; as any shitty mushrooms you&#039;re eating (not that naturalness is any measure of experience quality).<br /><br />Acid FTW.

				Yeah so many people swear by mushrooms but those same people also say &quot;as long as you don&#039;t move around that much the nausea isnt that bad&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />I want to do shrooms cuz it is fun but yeah the nasea can be wicked.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll tell you this shrooms, do them alone or with extremely trusts and people you wouldn&#039;t get embarrassed around.<br /><br />Acid feels like you&#039;ve dosed yourself with something, shrooms feel like something dosed you..so hard to explain...both are fun<br /><br />So if your a big guy and need a ton of ug to feel something then I say acid, if your a light weight I say acid or shrooms would both be good

				I enjoy both depending on what I&#039;m in the mood for. Shrooms is more euphoric at the lower doses but there&#039;s a point of diminished returns as you increase the dosage. Acid, on the other hand, can give you more euphoria than you can handle when venturing beyond the 300ug range. <br /><br />I do shrooms more often than acid because I rarely have enough free time to enjoy a full acid trip. But I do find acid more fulfilling as it opens my eyes and senses to everything the world has to offer in a way that shrooms doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />Admittedly, I didn&#039;t like acid so much until I got a hold of some quality stuff on SR.

				There&#039;s definitely more anxiety in the shroom trip. I have a feeling that part of it is due to the body load. Another thing is the feeling that communicating my experience is futile. It&#039;s very isolating. I love shrooms and may even venture to call them the more introspective drug at lower doses, but I cannot do them as casually as I enjoy acid.

				Shrooms are a fucking hot little band playing a scuzzy little venue. Acid is plunging head first into 5 days of Glastonbury festival. Both can be utterly amazing experiences, just that one can be a bit more gruelling but ultimately, perhaps, a richer experience.<br /><br />Vendor subtickle had (stress the past tense) some superb LSD. Keep checking his page to see if it comes back. Last lot made my girl think she was connected to every raindrop in the park on our midnight stroll. Gotta be a good thing.....

				I love them both!<br /><br />Different medicines for different applications, I feel. I don&#039;t get the body load from mushrooms though. It helps that I grow clean, x2 potency, Penis Envy though.<br /><br />Shrooms are more for alone in nature while acid I can do in a social setting much easier.

				Acid.<br /><br />I loved mushrooms when I was younger. Haven&#039;t had the urge for a long, long time.<br /><br />LSD is the greatest thing, period.

				They are different, each one has its effects.<br /><br />I personally prefer mushrooms, as I find that they have more character and spirituality. There is a feeling that the mushroom entity is communicating its wisdom.<br /><br />The LSD trip is more objective. Your mind accelerates and you can make mental connections and reason much faster.<br /><br />But I do find that mushrooms tend to work better in quiet environments. I personally find it very difficult to enjoy a mushroom trip in a social setting, such as a club or concert. I prefer to take them in nature or at home by myself or with some close friends who are also taking mushrooms. Mushrooms also tend to make you want to be still and quiet, even lay down. On the other hand, I enjoy taking LSD in social setting, concert, or club. LSD makes me more energetic, while mushrooms tend to make me more introspective.<br /><br />Regarding aftereffects, I find that both drugs are very clean, and produce almost no hangover. For mushrooms I prefer having them in tea to minimize any disturbances to the stomach.
