				I heard about it from a friend but he found it on reddit and it would have been only time until I discovered it there myself. this was a year ago now, i believe after &quot;the gawker article&quot;. I personally think the more people the safer it is so i don&#039;t mind spreading it around to people I know I can trust.

				Saw it on the hidden wiki, looked at it out if interest. I assumed it was a scam but saw that the site looked very legitimate. Researched it and found out it was legit and was completely shocked. I bought some bit coins and made an order. <br /><br />Only ordered a little bit of weed but was so over the moon when it landed on my door step. The fact that I bought this online like I buy everyday items was fantastic. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know many people so getting drugs is hard, I can get weed if I bother enough people. Thanks to SR I tried MDMA as I&#039;ve always wanted to, that was brilliant. <br /><br />I educate myself on drugs before I try them and like to make sure I&#039;m getting a quality product, thanks to SR I can!

				In the summer of 2011<br />A friend told me something about a website...didn&#039;t knew the name, all that he told me was .onion......Took me 2 weeks of search on internet to figure out what is a BTC, how to buy , what is PGP, how to use Tor, what is Tor....I was impressed .<br /><br />First I found The Black Market...A week I thought that is the website and after finding the real website http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php [ this is the old address ] and I was shocked about the huge difference between two websites. I mean BMarket is a small place where you can be scamed easily . <br />After that I found the Farmers Market and OVDB too .

				Honestly I dont even know how I found it... But I do know I was searching for some way to purchase drugs, for several days. Really looked hard...<br />But I do know I saw someone say something about silkroad somewhere, and it was very brief and bland. And from there I used google, and fell apon some bullshit silkroad forum. It seemed almost legit, for a day or so before I figured out the real gateway to the silkroad! :D<br /><br />Best thing thats ever happened to me...

				I&#039;m not happy how I found it, Daily Mail, always looks down their noses at cannabis users, so you can imagine the disdain shown to class A drug users sellers. Well&nbsp; they have run 2 full page articles on Silk Road. *Pauses as comes to the distasteful bit* Then I Googled it and guess what? Only a step by step guide to configure and run Tor, five mins later I was here. &quot;24&nbsp; hours after that I had a smoke of the best god dam ****** I have ever had in my life( well since the late 90&#039;s). I don&#039;t like they ease of which I got here. Maybe a little jealous I never found it earlier. But gutted some clown has put a step by step dummies guide. What a fecking liberty eh?

				Quite a while back I remember reading about Tor and general internet privacy but never explored it any further. Then a few months later I suppose I saw the funny bitcoin logo a few times on websites, and then it intrigued me. A quick wikipedia search on what bitcoin was led back to Tor, and then research into Tor led onto the abyss which is the deep web inevitably finding SR.
