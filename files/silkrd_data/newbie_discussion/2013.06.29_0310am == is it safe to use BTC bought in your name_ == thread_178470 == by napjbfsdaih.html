				Is it safe to deposit bitcoins that you&#039;ve bough on a exchange with your bank account? Should I use a mixer? Buy in the street?

				Most likely you won&#039;t have any issues because of the difficulty to track and the limited resources currently available to authorities, but you shouldn&#039;t do this. Stay anonymous, stay safe.

				Pardon me if these are stupid questions, but:<br /><br />How can you buy BTC under a different name?&nbsp; Don&#039;t you have to give the BTC site your real name and bank account number?&nbsp; How else are they going to draw the money out of your account?<br /><br />Someone on another thread said they only buy BTC with cash.&nbsp; How do you do that?&nbsp; You can only buy/sell BTC online, right?&nbsp; So how do you give them cash?&nbsp; I assume you don&#039;t send the cash in the mail, as that&#039;s always a bad idea.

				Ugh, I have so much to learn. . . <br /><br />I would like to find a safe way to do this with just making a transfer, as getting out to a location to buy them can be a challenge.

				There are vendors on SR that sell BTC for cash in mail. It&#039;s risky, but then again, so is buying drugs on the internet.

				ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion<br /><br />Blue Sky Traders.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I have never personally used them but I have only heard amazing things about them.<br /><br />The process is detailed on their website but heres how it goes in a simple explanation:<br />You send them an email with your BTC address(should use an electrum wallet which only connects to TOR) and the amount you will pay. They have a $400 limit for first time buyers but they are only doing that to weed out the people who set it up and never pay. In reality if you ask them they won&#039;t be like, &quot;Fuck you keep your money&quot;. They&#039;ll help you.<br /><br />Anyways you email them this info and they email you back detailed deposit instructions. You head over to bank of america and deposit into an account. No ID or even name required.<br /><br />Then you go home and wait for BTC to be funded then buy drugs and use them.

				If we&#039;re talking in the few hundred dollar range, don&#039;t worry about it. Once you&#039;re in to the thousands and especially 10,000+ is when you need to start being hardcore about being anonymous and buying bitcoin.

				Ok say I buy bitcoins with my real name and bank account. What is the best way to put the most distance between my SR transaction and my identity? <br /><br />(not that I am particuarly worried, as I only intend to spend ~$300-$500)

				Use a coin tumbler. If you are really worried, use it multiple times.

				Im sure this is probably the same as a coin tumbler, but from what I know bi coin address are easy to generate, so just get a shitload of and shuffle those coins around.
