				I know for certain of at least one other person who placed an order last week and had the same issue.&nbsp; She cancelled after several days of processing, the seller&#039;s comments and that no-show review.<br /><br />I wish k1llin all the best but &quot;cop drama&quot; + acid dealer = back away slowly.&nbsp; ??? At least for now...&nbsp; It would be good to hear some encouraging words from the man himself, no?

				You sound a bit like a paranoid drug addict who jumps to the worst if things don&#039;t go immediately as planned right away. Careful man, I&#039;ve heard good things about that vendor too. It would be respectable to edit your first post so as not to detract other potential buyers away from a vendor who hasn&#039;t done anything wrong.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about everyone else but I take &quot;VENDOR SCAMMER!!!&quot; things very serious. And if it isn&#039;t serious/isn&#039;t actually a problem, it should be fixed. I&#039;m sure most of us can&#039;t fathom the level of work some of these vendors do.<br /><br />Respect friends &lt;3

				SWIM is not legal protection. SWIM will not hold up in court. If you think that you are basically thinking that the judicial system has the intelligence of a vending machine.<br /><br />Glad to see this got resolved...or the FBI is posting for him right now and this is only furthering the honeypot!
