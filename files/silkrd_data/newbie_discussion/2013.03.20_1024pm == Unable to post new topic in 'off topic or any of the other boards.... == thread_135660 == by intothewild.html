				He mean&#039;s when you registered, especially for a site of this nature, you should really know all the do&#039;s and dont&#039;s. I think the majority of the people who are at least serious, and not silly teenagers who might think this site is cool or whatever, research before joining here and understand what is expected.

				No need to attack!&nbsp; Some people are simply a bit zealous to get started and jump in feet first.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying this is why but this is all illegal so a little help from the community without making anyone feel stupid can and should be done.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is truth to the warnings though...No vendor will appreciate you not knowing the rules before buying such as NEVER posting anything regarding where your package came from or how it was packed.&nbsp; Keep that in mind as that is a far bigger NO NO!!!

				appreciate your back up. I do understand and try to take as many precautions as I can to keep this going<br />but yeah can be tricky when people bite at your ass for just asking a question even though it may appear dumb
