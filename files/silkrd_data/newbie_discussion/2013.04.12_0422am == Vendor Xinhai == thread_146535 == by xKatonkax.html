				I was originally going to try to get to 50 posts and post this in the meth vendor review thread but it just takes way too god damn long to get 50 posts so I just figured I should post this now.<br /><br />I placed an order with them on last friday for their .25g listing x2, and its now approaching the next friday and I have yet to see a package ( I do believe it is coming though). I ordered off of them in the first place for their fairly cheap price and a lot of their feedback was praising their supposedly fast shipping. what really bothers me though is that I live in the same state as them so I assumed on top of everyone else getting the package fast that being that close I would too for sure, but alas thats not the case and now I received the pipe I bought off a different vendor on the same friday,&nbsp; on wednesday ( so I have a pipe and no meth to partake in, such a travesty), so I just want to say if youre looking for quick shipping this vendor unfortunately doesnt have it. :\

				Hmm well I am glad I decided not to order from them. I ordered from top gear instead and I think I am going to be satisfied. Although he did say u would.beshipped yesterday and it still says processing.

				I am glad you posted I thought I was the only one who had a recent issue. I received my package in 4 days to East coast but item was not&nbsp; inside. It came priority and was packaged well. I am not sure if it was a mistake or maybe an associate? Glad it was a small order but regardless it&#039;s not good. It has been a day since I sent a PM and I am waiting to hear back.

				Yeah, now I noticed he read a pm I sent him but he sent no reply, Im starting to think he might be a scammer, but ill wait until later today and see if I do get the package. I wish I had 50 posts to say something to the senior members in the meth vendor review thread, Ive already seen 2 members there make purchases.

				He responded after I left feedback. I guess the stealth is to stealth for me to figure out. I like trying different people but I plan to stick with who I have used in the past. With his stats it&#039;s hard for me to accuse him but shit happens too. I hope it works out for you.

				So spartan, you did receive the product? Could you pm me to let me know what to expect when I get it if its really that difficult to find.
