				Anybody order and test these out? Looking for reviews on overall effect and similarity to Adderall or any other concentration/energy aid.

				Got a bulk order a while ago, and have been enjoying them immensely. One of the best transactions I have made so far, and I&#039;ve had a couple dozen. Mrouid is an absolute professional and a joy to work with (he is in the top 1%) and his stealth is over the top. <br /><br />Each pill isn&#039;t quite as powerful as a typical adderall, but close and the effect is very similar. For the price of 1 addy, though, you could take like 4 of these! I wouldn&#039;t recommend these to a regular user/addict of stimulants but if you want to just get wired for work or study this is the way to go, hands down. They are totally clean and consistent, and easily dosed, line in the back makes them easy to cut in half. Most people with no tolerance will find 1/2 pill gives a good boost for a work day; 1 will get you good and motivated for 12 hours. 2 or more - you will be spun and need benzos to sleep. What sells me is that there is no discernible caffeine cut and the comedown is barely noticeable, which is a dream come true for me. I&#039;ve gotten fairly cheap speed on SR a couple times but it is always wet so you lose up to half the weight, and after a few jittery comedowns I said fuck that shit. <br /><br />Bottom line, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll find a better hook up on this type of thing anywhere. Read the reviews if you don&#039;t believe it. Mrouid only ships express and requires a signature to receive. I was a little sketched but like I said his stealth is about as good as it gets and more than adequate for pills. I would sign for them any day without a tinge of worry. International shipment took less than 2 days from time of order.

				Yeh , I have always wanted to try them too.<br />Would have to be a minimum order of 200 for me though as the shipping costs are 0.8 bitcoins High priority International.
