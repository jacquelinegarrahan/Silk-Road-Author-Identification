				I notice in the vendor feedback hardly anyone goes back and updates they&#039;re had to fe feedback post. it would be good if we newbs would do this to maybe protect other newbs from scams, what do you think? I took the time to do it.<br />If you go back to your account page and click view feedback you can edit your feedback.

				i wasn´t aware you could edit the orginal FE ranking/comment till earlier. so that is probably why people aren´t doing it. I agree it should be a must. specially after trying the gear to provide quality feedback

				The first vendor I ever offered from threatened buyers to put them on a blacklist if they don&#039;t give him the 5/5 rating. I didnt know then that no one gives a shit about that list.&nbsp; :)<br />And that was the main reason my review wasn&#039;t really honest.

				It sucked having to fe for my 2nd purchase and not my 1st. Now I always weigh and sample the wares&nbsp; before making any finalization or feedback. If I&#039;m dissatisfied&nbsp; usually I wont contact the seller, unless I&quot;m a regular customer. I just leave less than&nbsp; 5 with the honest reason behind the rating.&nbsp;

				Lack of trust comes to mind first. To my minds way of thought, only after repeated dealings does a loose form of trust take shape.<br />After all the first few times out of the gate eyebrows will be raised due to status.<br /><br />And really....Anyone can take advantage of another at least once. It will be remembered and possible actions may be taken, effective or not.<br /><br />Nobody wants the short end.&nbsp; But the ice must be broken somehow.

				you can go back and edit your feedback anytime you would like. some people just finalize with a 5/5 for recieving the product with &quot;leave feedback here&quot;<br />and then after they have tried or whatever they go back and comment on quality. IMHO if you recieved what you were supposed and stealth was good<br />you should leave a 5. you can always write in the txt what could have been better. but if you go around leaving bad feedback because it wasnt as <br />strong as you expected. vendors are not gonna sell to your username and you will have to start over.
