				Hello, I am wondering about 3M Moisture Barrier Bags and their traceability:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">CLEARNET</code>http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Static/Home/ProductCatalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GDE40I2KG4TI91816000000_nid=D946WGPBNTbeCHW1NDTH4Zgl<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">/CLEARNET</code><br />Also, how can buyers trust SR MBB vendors? Isn&#039;t there a danger it could be LE tracking the bag shipments to their destination?

				Buying MBBs is not reason enough to trigger any kind of investigation. It&#039;s not like they only exist for drugs. There are many legal uses. Not to mention, how would they be traced exactly??? Wouldn&#039;t the same LE group/person have to be the one to send you the MBBs and the one who buys the drugs from you!? I understand we&#039;re all a little paranoid around here to say the least, but this is going overboard.

				Just DAFS and found this: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18506.msg200724#msg200724<br /><br />&#039;I noticed that on some of the vendors&#039; descriptions they say things like &quot;batch coded for traceability&quot;. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure whether anybody bothers keeping records of these numbers, but is it possible that these batch codes could potentially be linked to a seller, if they bought them legitimately with their own details.&#039;<br /><br />reply:<br />&quot;Every bag manufactured to mil-spec requirements will have some numbers impressed into the lower seal lines.&nbsp; If you get a bag that&#039;s been stamped you should cut the trace code out and reseal that edge.<br /><br />Raw sheet stock is not imprinted with any trace codes, instead the wrapper and cardboard spool are marked with the trace info (mfr/batch/lot/date).&nbsp; It&#039;s the job of the guy who seals it into bagging to put a trace code on the formed bag.<br /><br />Again, thank you for catching that and I should have mentioned that pre-formed bags or dumpster dive recovered&nbsp; bags might have trace codes on them.&nbsp; If you run into that just trim that edge off and reseal it.&quot;<br /><br />Sounds like a perfect solution.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=208633.msg1503991#msg1503991">Quote from: See3PO on August 30, 2013, 05:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Buying MBBs is not reason enough to trigger any kind of investigation.

There are tons of uses for them besides illegal goods and they have much better and much easier ways of busting people. If you already have LE/DEA,etc watching you then maybe you&#039;d have some problems I guess, but if that&#039;s the case you&#039;re already fucked probably lol.
