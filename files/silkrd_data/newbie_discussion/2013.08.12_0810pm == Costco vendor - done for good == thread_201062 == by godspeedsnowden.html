				&quot;8/12/13 - Costco is closing it&#039;s doors today and will not be reopening. All outstanding orders will be sent today. We will no longer answer any messages. If there is a problem with your order take in to the SR Resolution Center. Thanks for all of your support.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />What do you guys think of this?

				I think a vendor decided it was time to close up shop. Probably a wise decision for them, but probably not indicative of much else.

				I think lots of people saw this coming....I can&#039;t discuss how I know this as it was between private conversations between customers and me. For anyone that was ordering Costco&#039;s Xanax powder, a huge amount of his customers have told me after trying my powder they realized his was no where near pure as mine is and I charge pretty much half of what he was charging for my powder! :) So, for all those that are worried about not having access to Xanax powder, I have by far the cheapest and PROVEN to be as pure as it can be Xanax Powder on the road. I ship out of Canada and only to the USA and Canada. NONE of my orders have ever been seized in either Country :) We take great pride in our stealth.<br /><br />Take care my fellow roaders!

				Man, whats with all the hate? Your powder has been proven to not even be as close as pure as mine and I sell it half the price you do. You are an extremely jealous prick that has threatened me if I did not raise my prices as I was taking so much of your business and every single time I responded &quot;this is a free market man, everyone is free to sell whatever drugs they like for whatever price they want. their are plenty of customers to go around and I don&#039;t feel threatned me by you so you don;t feel threatned by me and we&#039;ll just do our own thing&quot; but NO you wanted to have complete control over the market even though you sold like 10 other products that made you money and I only sell one product and I am only doing it to feed my family. You are the biggest P.O.S. vendor on the road, were supposed to look out for each other not hate.<br /><br />You don&#039;t even have a real Xanax powder link, maybe a China source but thats it....Nothing you ever sold came close to the purity of mine, PEACE glad you are leaving so I never receive one of your threats again!

I am finally back in stock with my famous 100% pure Xanax powder! I am so sorry for the long wait, but I am finally back and this time MUCH more prepared to keep up with the massive demand for my product! :) Everyone that has tried it verified that it is the only 100% pure pharma Xanax powder being sold on the road (it has also been lab test verified)&nbsp; and my prices are half of what most vendors charge for their lower grade powder. I love being able to serve you all with this product, I receive such lovely messages from so many of you every day thanking me and telling me how grateful you are for me being able to provide you with this medication for cheaper than your local pharmacy can! All the words of encouragement and gratitude really make all the long hours so worth it, I just want to make everyone who orders from me as happy as possible :)<br /><br />You know with me you always get MORE then what you paid for, nice overweight bags shipped the same or next day very stealthy and the most pure product! :)<br /><br />Take care my fellow roaders!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />hahahah anyone can make a forum account and claim they tested the product and it 100% pure. lets see some proof. i would bet $100k that you are the scum bag behind the account that posted that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />WOAH, I AM THE SCUM BAG?! YOU WANNA BET ME 100K LETS DO IT, I EVEN KNOW A DEA LICENSED LAB WE CAN GET IT SET TO FOR A $140 TESTING FEE THAT I WILL COVER! I CAN&#039;T BELIEVE YOU OF ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE NERVE TO CALL ME A SCUM BAG! That&#039;s why HUNDREDS of your customers came to me telling me you were cutting the SHIT out of your powder and you doubled your price as soon as I ran out of stock! THEY ALL TOLD ME OF YOUR HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND YOU WERE ALWAYS MESSAGING ME AT WAR WITH ME TRYING TO OWN THE XANAX MARKET WHILE I AM JUST TRYING TO BE A NICE GUY AND SELL ACTUAL REAL PHARMA POWDER (NOT CHINA SHIT LIKE YOU) FOR BY FAR THE BEST PRICE ON THE ROAD! AND FOR ALL YOUR INFO, IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE PRETTY MUCH 100% PURE XANAX POWDER. THIS POWDER IS 99% PURE WITH AN ERROR OF SOMETHING LIKE 0000.5%...IT IS AS PURE AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE. ASK ANYONE THAT HAS TRIED IT, YOU TAKE 2MG AND IT HITS YOU EVEN HARDER AND FASTER THEN A 2MG BAR AS IT IS ALREADY IN A POWDER FORM.<br /><br />Costco is clearly VERY jealous of me as he was always messaging me, saying I was taking so much of his business and even threatened me for me to raise my prices so he would get more business. People do not just purchase from me because I have the highest quality powder, it is the customer service and great lengths I go through to make them happy that drove so many of your customers over to me as people living in the USA would happily pay extra to buy it domestic off you but instead they choose me, as my product is a way higher purity. I have never run across such a mean vendor in all my time here on the road. We are supposed to have eachothers backs and since your not even a vendor anymore why would you post so much hate for? Maybe you need to take some off that cut up Xanax powder you were selling and try and relax.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />PP,<br /><br />you idiot, we all know about http://www.ecstasydata.org/ and their test for $140. It might be a surprise to your uneducated bullshiting self that they only test for active ingredients not the non-active binders<br /><br />&quot;Can you tell me if my generic / Indian generic pharmaceutical is the same as the name brand? Answer: No, not really. This program is set up for providing basic analysis for controlled street drugs. You will get a list of identified drugs in the sample with ratios, just like every other result from EcstasyData / DDL. You will not get amounts/dose, nor a list of binders or inactive agents such as sugars, salts, etc. If knowing that your Internet Avodart or Tramadol contains dutasteride or tramadol is enough for you, then our testing might be useful. Again, the cost is $140 per sample&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.ecstasydata.org/faq.php<br /><br />I see your test here http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2802 ... all that shows is that the powder you sell contains alprazolam and could be of any purity<br /><br />So you really have nothing to back up what you claim. Next time you wanna talk with the big kids do some research<br /><br /><br />hahaha you stupid fuck

				I dont know, something strange is going on, its been 9 days since I placed an order with Costco, he put it in transit on last Wednesday and I still have yet to receive the package and then he goes off and leaves. I have probably purchased from costco at least ten times in the past year, either blues or alp powder, and it always arrived within two days, its really sad to see him go, but what is this all this trash talk about taking the market back? I thought I read the message as &quot;will not reopen.&quot;<br /><br />and as far as my transaction with him, do I really have to wait 12 days so I can hit resolve so I can get my money back? Unless he answers me privately here, I will respect his request not to message him on silk road, but on his page he asks his customers not to make inquiries about a package until it has been a week since it has been marked in transit, well today it has been a week.<br /><br />I have much respect for costco, always professional, again, sad to see him go, but I don&#039;t want to be left hanging here

				Costco bro, why do you have to act so hard over the internet?! I TALK OUT OF MY ASS?! hahaha, dude if it wasn&#039;t against the rules I could post close to 100 messages from you ex customers telling me how dishonest you are and they knew you were gonna pull a runner (or leave the site, you most likely scammed everyone first though judging on your incredibly greediness charging $230 bucks for a gram of not even 50% pure Xanax powder) Literally EVERY customer that bought off you and then came to me told me your batches were getting weaker and weaker bro! You got SO mad when I listed my powder for pretty much half the price of yours you actually threatened me to raise my prices! VENDORS OUR SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS AND THIS MARKET IS FKN MASSIVE AND YOU AND ME WERE PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY VENDORS IN NORTH AMERICA WITH THIS PRODUCT! How greedy can you be you sorry sack of shit?<br /><br />You saying you want to sell you Xanax link to everyone to put me out of business just shows how much of an asshole you are. You are not even vending here anymore and I never insulted you ONCE (until you did) and you go off on me like this. By the way buds, EVERYONE knows your garbage &quot;Xanax&quot; is not American made like you claimed it was. Your nasty powder either comes from China or India and I&#039;ll bet the 100k you promised once we get the purity checked (and i am not talking about extasy data.org or whatever....I have NEVER sent a sample there. The machiene used is exactly like the one you see if you&#039;ve ever watched &quot;nothing to declare&quot; so if you dropped Cocaine in it, it would come up for cocaine and whatever other cuts are in it. With my powder, the only chemical that showed up was Xanax with a purity of 99.9% with an error of 0000.5% IT IS AS PURE AS POSSIBLE<br /><br />But as I was saying, I&#039;ll take you up on that 100K bet, see if you can put your money where your mouth is. ALL your customers came to me for a reason. Firstly, I am actually a nice guy that writes long, courteous responses to my customers. Everyone can see you are a hot headed A-hole. My prices were also WAY cheaper then you and considering you were probably paying no more then 5 bucks a gram as that is the going rate for 1000 grams (a kilo) of Xanax powder in China or India, yet you charged over 200 bucks which shows pure greed. As soon as I started taking your business you lowered your prices to match mine, proving you could still make an amazing profit charging half of what you were. Many of your customers abandoned you as they saw how greedy you are as once I ran out of stock, you immediately put the crazy high prices back.<br /><br />I have it written right at the top of my page that my prices will NEVER go up even though I could easy charge MORE then double because m powder is actually pure, in fact, I have lowered my prices on several occasions.<br /><br />Do you really think you threatening me by saying your going to give everyone you Xanax powder link scares me? As I told you EVERY TIME you threatened me to raise my prices to match yours....THIS IS A FKN MASSIVE MARKET PLACE! Look at the MDMA, Cocaine, heroin, Meth, etc. dealers. There are THOUSANDS of them and they ALL make serious bank. Do you think I care if it takes me an extra week or even month to sell my powder? It all turns to money eventually which I tried explaining to you 100X but you are just SO greedy, since you were basically the only one selling Xanax powder you somehow felt you deserved to control the whole market.<br /><br />And man, even if you somehow &quot;flooded the market&quot; as soon as people realize it;s YOUR connection, they are going to want NOTHING to do with it. Either you or your connect was whacking it down HARD and the only reason I say that without any actual proof (well I have proof but PM&#039;s can&#039;t be posted) is that literally, even as far back as a month ago, I had over a hundred people begging me to get my powder back in stock because your&#039;s was getting consistently worse.<br /><br />You obviously tried to make as much money before you retired but you did it in the most dishonest way possible. I just want to know one thing why do you care so much about trying to effect my business when I have done NOTHING to you? Like how much of a P.O.S. do you have to be to do something like that? YOU ARE NOT VENDING ANYMORE, WHY DOES IT MATTER THAT I AM SELLING A PRODUCT THAT USED TOO? PLEASE, explain WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU GAIN FROM IT? Not that I am worried brother..I think your a little jealous that a Canadian vendor got way more sales into the USA then a domestic US vendor. People call my the Xanax Powder king for a reason (not trying to sound cocky)<br /><br />Costco, if the insults and threats continue I will have no choice but to report you. I am here to serve the community, not get in childish arugments with such a rude hot head like you man...We could have worked together....I could have actually given you a REAL north American pharma link so you could ship it domestic in the US&nbsp; but no, you for whatever reason just HAVE to be the KING on a goddamn anonymous message board and website AHAHA.&nbsp; Seriously, are you even over 18 bro? Because you are VERY childish, I hope you wake up and realize fighting and threatening me is going to hurt YOU much longer in the long run then me EVERY other vendor I have ever talked to (including ones selling the same product) have been nothing but some of the nicest people I have talked to the road....We have the Vendor Roundtable for a reason man! Were supposed to be working WITH each other, not against. YOU are the only Vendor that actually is purposely trying to use a feeble attempt at damaging my business, RIGHT ON THE OPEN FORUM!<br /><br />Do you have any idea how much of an idiot you look like? Seriously...

In my opinion, this is just fine. Business is business. Talking shit about his product was completely unnecessary, however. If his product sucks his customers would complain and likely move on, which works out great for you. There&#039;s really no reason to be petty about it, as it just ends up making you look bad regardless of whether or not you&#039;re right.

				Um, I NEVER wanted to argue with this dude. I ignored EVERY message he sent me. If I knew a vendor would be so hurt about me saying his shit is whacked down when he is RETIRED (seriously man, why aren&#039;t you on a beach somewhere sipping drinks fuckin girls?) when I get enough money to get out I&#039;ll never visit the forums again, never mind start such a fight that makes you look 12. But if he is going to be so rude to me on the OPEN forums, I NEED to defend myself....I am done with arguing with him. If he keeps going he&#039;ll be talking to himself.<br /><br />PEACE EVERYONE :)

				Number 1: I have bought a lot of stuff from Costco probably more then most people spend all year, I spend in a week. No issues. Always professional, good product and timely. Number 2: Rather then spending the time trying to kill someones rep I would be more concerned about covering my ass and not getting busted. There are bigger fish to fry here folks not fighting amongst ourselves. Number 3: Some dealer advice. Focus on yourself, not others, don&#039;t draw attention to yourself and above all DON&#039;T GET GREEDY! There are a lot of vendors bugging out right now because of Tormail etc. The last thing anyone needs is to loose more because of this bullshit.
