				Is this possible or do you have to go through an exchange like Mt.Gox? Has anyone done this successfully?&nbsp; thanks

				You have to either go through a third party or sell something on SR to fund your BitCoin address.

				Yes, you can do this.&nbsp; Just select &quot;Bitcoin Address&quot; under &quot;Pay to&quot; and type your SR wallet address there.<br />I usually dump my coins into a separate wallet first (Blockchain), then transfer them from there to my SR wallet just for an extra layer of obscurity.

				My bad.&nbsp; I read the question wrong.&nbsp; Yes, you most definitely can use bitinstant to fund your SR address, and I&#039;ve done it twice with great results.&nbsp; Mt. Gox is a million times slower if you don&#039;t already have a verified account and a funding account for it set up.&nbsp; The only downside to bitinstant is the fees - about $8.&nbsp; But, it&#039;s the fastest way I know.&nbsp; Sorry about my previous answer.

				So I know you can deposit money into a BitInstant transfer by going to a place and putting in money. Another option they give you is a direct transfer through paypal. While paypal says they don&#039;t share your information, I&#039;m skeptical as to how secure this is. I&#039;m trying to avoid other wallets to keep things from getting complicated, but is it just better that way? Is a direct, in person deposit or paypal transfer just not safe enough?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t even made a purchase yet because I&#039;m still trying to feel out all the details like these. Obviously paypal is the most convenient, but it also seems the least safe. At the same time, why would BitInstant offer the service if it wasn&#039;t at least somewhat secure?

				&nbsp;so the route I&#039;ve decided to take is BitInstant --&gt; BlockChain wallet --&gt; SR account<br /><br />Thank you all for the fast replies, a great community!

				Good luck.&nbsp; I wish I had discovered this forum when I was feeling my way through all this a few weeks ago.&nbsp; It still is boggling to me that there is no service where you cannot simply input a credit card number and fund a bitcoin address.&nbsp; Even when Dwolla and Mt. Gox are good to go, it still could take as long as 4 days to go from my checking account to my SR account.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll just keep paying the overly high fee - it&#039;s not a bad tradeoff for the time it saves.

				Guys to those of you r new. Bitinsant is simple and cheaper.. MT GOX wants to much info..yea its legal but still..<br /><br />Iv been a member 7 mnths, and iv always used Bitinstant and had them sent right to my SR account..<br /><br />SR has a tumble that tumbles them before they go to your account, guys dont waste your money on foggin them or xtra tumbling..Dont send them to 5 other wallets ..Send it to your BTC address,,THING i do is i put how much i need for the purchases im gonna make,i never leave more than 10 bucks in my acount,and spend the coins soon as u can.<br /><br />after u have spent your coins generate a new account #.. SO THAT way it will never be sent to the same one again..<br /><br />I had a account under another name for 2mnths but it only has 2 purchases on it and i used it when i first found paradise..lol, then i forgot the passcode and really do not care if it still works or not. My one i have now im thinking about offering to sell it to a newbie,and start over again and let te vendors know its me switching names, and in return it will help noobs not have to FE..iv got close to 40 transactions made, all went perfect! iv always got my goods and only 3 times did i have to have a reship.<br /><br />so if a neb wants a account wih pegect stats i think i have 35 drug transactions and about 4 in gambling.<br />Its got thousnds of dollars spent..<br /><br />Im not 100% sure yet im gonna do this but PM me if u r interested ,cause i hate to know nebwbs have to FE an many willl get fucked..I woudnt charge much at all for the account.if i decided to do this.. <br /><br />Im not sure if this is against rules.

I might take you up on that.

				I guess a secure (anonymous) &amp; simple (fast) way to add Bitcoins to your account would be to use a proxy server<br />to get to BitInstant, use a fake name &amp; birthday then just send funds directly to your (SR) Bitcoin Address&nbsp; 8)
