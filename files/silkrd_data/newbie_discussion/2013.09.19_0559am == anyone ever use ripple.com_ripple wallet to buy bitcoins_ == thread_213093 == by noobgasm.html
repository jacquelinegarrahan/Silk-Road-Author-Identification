				I searched on this topic in the forums and found nothing about ripple.com/ripple wallets. I was wondering if anyone had experience using this method to fund their bitcoin wallet? I used to use bitinstant but that is obviously down so now I am looking for another method to fund my wallet. I&#039;m already verified with bitstamp and would like to be able to use their services.<br /><br />This is the method I found to fund a wallet with bitcoins from a bank account:<br />1) Setup a Ripple account.<br />2) Fund it with SnapSwap.<br />3) Send the money to Bitstamp using Ripple. The deposit money page when you&#039;re logged into Bitstamp will have the Ripple address to send money to in order to fund your account. <br />4) Buy bitcoins with the newly funded account.<br />5) Send bitcoins to your wallet (optional)<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a lot about ripple being evil because it could destroy bitcoin and/or have potential scam problems. I was hoping someone could provide some first hand experience using ripple. I was wondering if anyone has been scammed, the likely hood of scams happening,&nbsp; is there a better method?<br /><br />Reasons this method is appealing to me:<br />Allows me to use bitstamp even though I am not from Europe.<br />Totals fee are less than 2% in total from USD to bitcoin.<br />Does not use mt. gox<br />Allows for direct bank transfers.<br />Localbitcoins.com isn&#039;t an option for me.<br />CampBX (DWOLLA) has to hold your money for 31 days the first time you use it and I don&#039;t want to have to wait that long.<br />Coinbase is a possibility but I would have to get verified again and wouldn&#039;t be able to use bitstamp with this method.<br /><br />Anyone have any advice?<br /><br />Update: Found out this method also uses dwolla. So coinbase here I come.
