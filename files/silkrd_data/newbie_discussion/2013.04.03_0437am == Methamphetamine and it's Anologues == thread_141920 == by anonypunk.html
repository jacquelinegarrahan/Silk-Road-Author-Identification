				I just wanted to throw this out there after I made a purchase on SR recently. There are companies that sell methamphetamine analogues that can have a crystalline powder look and can be bought as shards as well. The initial feeling is similar to Methamphetamine and they all vary depending on many different factors like ROA, chemical structure, and the user but they dont have a rush that I&#039;m aware of.. I&#039;ve only had a couple and both had no euphoric high to them but were straight stimulants like caffeine and required much larger doses than you&#039;d normally live through on meth. I&#039;m no meth expert in any way and my favorite has always been cocaine but research the effects of ethylphenidate, methiopropamine (MPA), and propylhexadrine and you&#039;ll see that it would be easy to fool someone initially with shards of these chemicals.

				In some countries some of the research chemicals are legal or not technically illegal and it even varies per state as well.

				Some estimates put the LD50 for meth at 50mg/kg.&nbsp; For an average 60kg person, that&#039;s 3 grams it would take to kill half of the people who took it.&nbsp; Half of the ones who had no tolerance, mind you.&nbsp; (Meth)amphetamine is much harder to OD on than cocaine, so whether it&#039;s meth or methiopropamine... you&#039;re probably going to be surviving either way.&nbsp; Not entirely sure what you&#039;re getting at here.

				I mean, at a certain point you kind of just have to trust that the person selling you something isn&#039;t a giant douche, or don&#039;t buy the stuff. RCs have pretty much ruined the MDMA street trade around my neck of the woods. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see other drugs get the same treatment from shady dealers and distributors.

He had good reviews up until a day or two after I ordered. There&#039;s a few who got fooled by this vendor as well and a lengthy discussion in the Amphetamine thread in rumor mills. I&#039;ve been too lazy to bother with trying to get 50 posts but I would have said something there as well. I appreciate the advice regarding usage and euphoria. It&#039;s not something I am going to be &quot;into&quot; so to speak I just like a change from sobriety sometimes.
