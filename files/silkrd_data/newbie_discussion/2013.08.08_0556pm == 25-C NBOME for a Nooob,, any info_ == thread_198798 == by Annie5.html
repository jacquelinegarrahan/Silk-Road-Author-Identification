				I&#039;ve tried it once and it was alright. The tab I took was ~650ug. It&#039;s pretty similar to LSD. The only things that stood out as different to me were the taste of the hit(very chemically, and it fucked up my sense of taste for a few hours), the fact that it made speech relatively difficult for me(although my friend who took four of the same tabs with me didn&#039;t have this happen to him), and a killer headache the next day.<br /><br />Although the price compared to LSD is awesome, I would still take LSD if it were available. It just feels cleaner and less bodyloading. If you&#039;re into nBOMEs I would suggest you try 25i too. My personal favorite.

				Well, let us know your bodyweight so we have an idea on how much you should take.<br /><br />I am a fairly light person. <br />My first with 25c was at 200ug and it gave me ++ visuals. <br />My 2nd was at 300ug+ and I tripped balls. +++ visuals. <br /><br />The trip went like this. It is like you will skip death and go through this dark, wilderness of nothiness. <br />You will be confused and you might think you are losing grip on reality. Then after a while (for me, this took around an hour), you will be &quot;saved&quot; from this situation and you will feel very euphoric. You will feel like you survived it. You deserve this state you are in now and you know it. This is the euphoria that comes in with it. This is the time to talk with the people you tripped with. <br /><br />Look at the outdoors. Look at the clouds. The trees. Its leaves and branches. Everything nature will be so lovely. <br /><br />Just watch out for the intense body load and vasoconstriction. :)<br /><br />Trip safely.

				Go straight. 850 is a little less that is recommended. <br /><br />trusted SWIM reported extremely funny and excited trip doing 1000.<br /><br /><br />Good luck!
