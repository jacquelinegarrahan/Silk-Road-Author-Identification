				I don&#039;t think there is a problem, I do the same thing. I can&#039;t see how accessing clearnet websites would affect anything going on in TOR? But then what do I know really...

				I would tend toward the paranoid and avoid using Firefox alongside the (Firefox-based) Tor Browser Bundle. This is based purely on a fear of mixing up the browsed content between the two somehow - either my own stupidity or some confusion between installed and (apparently portable) coexisting versions of the software.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to inadvertantly put my Tor traffic through clearnet or vice versa.<br /><br />Can&#039;t see where the risk would be in co-running browsers from different companies though. IE and Chrome (for example) typically aren&#039;t aware of the others existence (including separate caches and sessions). You could have one on clearnet generally independently of on Tor (the TBB or whatever).<br /><br />Not that it&#039;s impossible to run multiple Firefox instances ( --no-remote and -p options ), just unwise in this case.<br /><br />I do all of my dealings via a memory-only VM, so nothing persists after power off.

				The increased risk definitely exists, but most people trust their browsers enough to neglect it. Browsers are big programs in widespread use and are therefore a popular attack vector. Although modern operating systems do a pretty good job with process isolation, it&#039;s not impossible for one process to access another process&#039;s memory (for example, using remote thread execution). That said, unless someone is really out to get you or you&#039;re wearing a tinfoil hat, there&#039;s not much to worry about in that situation. Just don&#039;t paste something from one browser to the other by accident or run any pesky Java web applets in either browser. In fact, disabling Java within the browser is a good security measure in general.

				guess its fine. <br /><br />But doing some cnn surfing is different that having one browser open with facebook, gmail and amazon, one via tor and a third one, unpached streaming porn and browsing shady privacy sites.<br />

The only way someone on the non TOR side could see your TOR activity would be if you had spyware or some other virus type thing injected on your machine. Then the person would actually be either taking over your machine and reading netstat/tcpdump stuff from your machine (if that is what they installed on your machine) but not particularly looking from one TCP &quot;lane&quot; to another. other browser or TCP sessions terminate their visibility on your machine, they can&#039;t see past it. <br />Bottom line is it doesn&#039;t matter. If you have something installed on your machine that allows remote viewing it doesn&#039;t matter if you have a spearate firefox browser open.
