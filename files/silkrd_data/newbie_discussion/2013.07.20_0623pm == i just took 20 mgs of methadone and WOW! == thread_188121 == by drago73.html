				Ashamed to say i&#039;m in my mid-thirties because this is a thread that a 13 year old would write! Lol! Seriously though, not much opiate tolerance, wish i could say the same for benzo&#039;s though. Anyway, it&#039;s been a few years since i last took methadones and i forgot how much i like the buzz compared to vicodin. Anybody else wanna share their experience with methadone.

				Never tried it. What sort of buzz do you get from it?

				It doesn&#039;t have as strong of a rush that comes from say oxycontin, but still a very nice buzz with some energetic physical and mental energy. I don&#039;t like to nod off of opiates because i like to be aware when i&#039;m buzzing. If you are a high tolerance daily opiate user you probably wouldn&#039;t get a &quot;buzz&quot; from it. Also, if you try, remember it stays in your system for a very long while, so when the buzz is gone, don&#039;t assume you can take more, because with it still in your system you could easily overdose.and you better not be 14 years old! Lol! Seriously though. Hope this helps.
