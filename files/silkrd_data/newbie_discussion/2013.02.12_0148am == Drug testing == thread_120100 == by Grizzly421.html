				Anybody in the US ever heard of probation drug testing for meph/m1/pv? I know they occasionally test for synthetic cannabinoids. It is an immunoassay test at a lab. I know it is possible to test for but probable?

				It&#039;s possible to do but my guess is that most places do not simply because it costs more and not everyone knows to test for it.&nbsp; I worked at a hospital for about a year in the ER and behavioral health floor, those kinds of tests are only done when one is suspected of being under the influence of them (ie not part of a normal screen).<br /><br />That is not to say that places of business don&#039;t test for it, some do, but I find it unlikely.<br /><br />ya dig?

				on another note, not sure how they are going to immunoassay for the presence of the chemical, usually they test for metabolites in the blood, urine, hair.&nbsp; If they immunoassay they may be looking for elevated levels of proteins or enzymes, which would make much sense to me.&nbsp; Then again i&#039;m not a lab tech in a testing facility : p&nbsp; There is the offchance that meph etc.. may throw the same chemical flags as other elicit substances which they really are testing for.&nbsp; That&#039;s the extent of my knowledge though, best to just play it safe and try to clear yourself out.

				I don&#039;t know that is immunoassay just that it is more than a dipstick test. I know meph/pv don&#039;t cross react in the past when every thing was legal I could go in high and test clean but that has been a few years back. I just wondered if they specifically look for it. <br /><br /><br />Also what are the chance of buying someone cut with amphetamines. I figure it wouldn&#039;t really make sense to do so since amphetamines are generally more expensive
