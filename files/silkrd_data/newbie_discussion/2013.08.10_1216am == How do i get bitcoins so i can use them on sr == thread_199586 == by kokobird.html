				I&#039;ve used both Coinbase and Cashintocoins, and both are very simple to use. Coinbase you attach your bank account and directly purchase bitcoins, but until you can verify your information further it takes 3-4 days for the transaction to clear. Cashintocoins is a simple cash deposit at one of several different banks, send a deposit slip to them with your email and wallet address and you can usually have coins that night.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any questions about either method.

Also payment is via bank account which is a good way to link who you are.&nbsp; Also I&#039;ve seen a lot of stories about their fraud detection system being very strict.&nbsp; Like if you are user@somecustomdomainyouhost.com that could cause flags to go off.&nbsp; Usually you can email and eventually they whitelist you.&nbsp; Would see them replying to people on twitter as well about it.&nbsp; But yeah, you need to plan in advance.<br /><br />There&#039;s always mt gox but being in US only real method to get money in there at the moment is wire transfer which is really expensive for me.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=116680.0<br /><br />That&#039;s a thread on buying bitcoins in the UK BUT it&#039;s well written and simple, and to my knowledge the advice still applies elsewhere (assuming you are elsewhere!). He advises using localbitcoins.com - they are pretty popular and have a good escrow system so your money is secured. You can also get your coins in a very short space of time, depending on your bank transfer system. It&#039;s also pretty decent for anonymity! <br /><br />Whatever way you choose to do it, make sure you search and research your chosen website / vendor / wallet etc to make sure it&#039;s legit and reliable. There are a tonne of sharks out there waiting to relieve you of your coin. Keep reading and learning as much as you can to protect yourself.
