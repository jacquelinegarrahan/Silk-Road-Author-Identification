				Wow, surely a new vendor must have a reserve of money for sending? <br /><br />That&#039;s ridiculous!

				So this guy is supposedly selling bulk weed but doesn&#039;t have the ~$20 to ship your order? I would recommend reporting him if you haven&#039;t already. Something&#039;s clearly not right here. This is one of the risks you take with new vendors. It&#039;s best to wait it out and look for reviews here on the forums.

				Hey dude, I&#039;m sorry to hear you got ripped off. This shit happens, but think about it --&nbsp; given the nature of this website, the amount of scams pulled off is remarkably low. We are so very lucky in that regard!<br />I was ripped off recently, for about $120 from Lucydrop. Was really looking to eat a fuck ton of acid, but nope, a few days after placing my order I found out that the vendor I purchased from lost his account to his partner and was getting scammed. So I lost $150. I was upset of course, but that&#039;s the name of the game! Mess with drugs, you&#039;re bound to get burnt by somebody at some point.

				seems pretty legit to me! <br />Makes sense to me.&nbsp; he underestimated the massive cost of express mail and did not take enough cash to the post office to send them all.<br />at least he was honest about it. <br />good reviews popping up on his page and i would love to hear form some of them.<br /><br />
