				I&#039;d give it a little bit longer before assuming you&#039;ve been scammed. Four days isn&#039;t long enough to worry.

				Give it a couple days before you get to worried. If you were smart and didn&#039;t finalize early, just go to the resolution center once it becomes available and you should be able to get a refund from SR staff, especially if you direct them to threads where he is reported scamming other people. Remember to do more research on the forums and other vendors before choosing one.

				Actually, I read over the scam report now, and it seems the reporter&#039;s a bit off the rails. And there&#039;s one guy saying listonshere&#039;s been fine. So yeah, could still work out.

				How can you be scammed if you didn&#039;t FE?<br /><br />If your money are in escrow you have lost anything.

Unless the vendor can prove that he sent a pack and it arrived via tracking, the resolution center will probably just send the btc back to you. <br /><br />And like others have said, a few more days are necessary before you start to worry about scamming. USPS can be slow sometimes.&nbsp; &gt;:(

If for example your order is domestic and you don&#039;t receive the package while the vendor insists that he sent it and you received it, if the vendor cannot PROVE that he really sent it and you - or someone other for you - got it (as with a DCN) then you, as a buyer, will get a full refund.<br /><br />If the SR admins decide you are not worthy of a refund then you can be sure the fault is yours somewhere (as in the aforementioned case someone else took the package for you), because the burden of proof is always on the vendor, not the other way around.<br /><br />Believe me, as it is now it is very difficult to get scammed if you follow the rules. If you don&#039;t FE the probability you will get scammed are practically 0.

				SR sides with the buyer when the buyer didn&#039;t receive their order. <br /><br />SR doesn&#039;t side with the buyer when they complain about quality.
