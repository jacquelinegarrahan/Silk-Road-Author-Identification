				is this going to be ok? i will most likely only be ordering blotter. also should i get a p.o. box if im going to be order this frequently or is it a bad idea to order like this? i made my first order the other day and it is en route to me. also should i use the same address if i dont get a p.o. box? i would like to know before i decide to order again. sorry for all the questions, hope someone gets back to me. thank you!

				Yes, you will be fine. Especially if all you&#039;re ordering are blotters. That is the easiest thing to send stealthily. No reason to get a P.O. Box. Just use your real name and address, order from reputable vendors, and you will be fine.

				Personally, I&#039;ve only been using SR for a very short time now and I have had no problems receiving anything to my own home address in my real name. As long as the stealth is good, it&#039;s just the same as any other mail coming to you! As stated already, it&#039;s a potential red-flag for some random weird name to show up for your address out of nowhere. Also, PO boxes add no security at all, plus some sellers refuse to send to them.

				awesome, thank you for all the replies. they have all made me more confident in using my real name and address. i did read through the buyers guide and several forums before i posted so i wasn&#039;t going in trying to state something someones already mentioned. I also figured blotter is most likely one of the stealthiest things to ship. thanks again to everyone!

				But why order once a week? Every vendor on the road offers savings for ordering in bulk. Suggest you buy 3 months supply in each order.

				No harm spreading the risk over a few packages if you don&#039;t mind spending a few extra bitcoin.
