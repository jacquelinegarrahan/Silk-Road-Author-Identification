				So ive only been a member of SR for like a month and already my main account was accessed and the PW was changed, I had pending orders, cancels, BTC etc in my account... Ive sent a message to support but haven&#039;t heard back and could take 48 hours. By then ill be SHOCKED if any of my btc is left!&nbsp; :( <br /><br />This is unacceptable, there NEEDS to be something in place to close, freeze or at least resolve a hacked account ASAP, this is peoples money and more at stake here&nbsp; &gt;:( <br /><br />In my other post on this it appears others have had their account hacked also in the past day or two so beware people!<br />

				During the attacks on SR, no one had their accounts compromised - that&#039;s not the kind of attack we were under.<br /><br />Always make sure you are at the following URL:&nbsp; silkroadvb5piz3r.onion&nbsp; &nbsp;... and never provide your PIN at the login screen.&nbsp; If it asks for one, it&#039;s a phishing site url.<br /><br />Once support is able to reset your password for you and you get back into your account, make sure that your password and PIN are both strong.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the PIN should not just include numbers!

				WELLLLLLLL.........&nbsp; &nbsp;72 hours later and still not a single response from support! MY Account is still 100% inaccessible...<br /><br /><br />This is why I think that there NEEDS to be a quick response support in the event of a compromised account... Even if my PIN is strong the thief has now had over 3 days to crack my PIN and steal all my BTC!

				umm, yeah... no.... you weren&#039;t hacked. imagine the time it would take to brute force over such a slow network. didn&#039;t happen. maybe you used the wrong URL and didn&#039;t realize it. seen it time and time again.<br /><br />take responsibility for your actions and quit blaming others.

It takes maybe an hour at worst to move your BTC to SR when you need it. It is absolutely a bad idea to keep BTC in your SR account. You should either be managing your own wallet or only dealing with exactly as much BTC you need to make transactions on a case-by-case basis.

				The fact that you can&#039;t login doesn&#039;t necessarily means that your account have been &#039;hacked&#039; as you call it.<br /><br />Did you log into a site&nbsp; looking like SR but on another URL? If so, did this site ask you for your pin?<br /><br />As long as you didn&#039;t answer those simple questions, it will be rather difficult to help you out... <br /><br />Anyway, I hope that you&#039;ll get some help from support rather soon :)<br /><br />

You should check for this, and guides for doing so are available on the clearnet; you can search for them through Tor.<br /><br />Having your account &#039;broken into&#039; is not &quot;very possible&quot;, it is possible but highly implausible. It would take thousands of years to brute-force a 6 - 8 character long password using random lowercase characters - a more complex password would take much, much longer, and the more complex a password gets the time required to brute-force it grows exponentially.<br /><br />Would you consider editing the title of your thread to reflect the fact that your account was NOT hacked, as it may be causing other newer members to worry unecessarily? :-\<br /><br />Libertas

				Hamburgler ...... I have read what you said and I can only wonder if there is ANY chance you did or did not use a required caps key ..... transposed numbers or alphas ..... I do believe you when you say you can not access your account. I can&#039;t be as sure your account was hacked. I believe when I signed up that there was a BIG disclaimer that if you loose or forget your password info that SR would not be able to help you and God knows there couldn&#039;t be anything more frustrating than not being able to access this particular account. I know when things go wrong for me at work the best solution is generally to just walk away from it for awhile get a cold drink relax and go back to it with a fresh start and clear mind. Easy for me to say I know.<br /><br />I treat my account exactly like Abitpeckish said ....... never keep any more bitcoins in my account then I need to do whatever transaction I want to complete. Myself and friends using this site prefer to use DWOLLA ....... it takes a few days to fund Dwolla but you can keep a cash balance there and when you need to make a transaction on SR you simply do a transfer to MTGOX buy your bitcoins and transfer them to SR to make your purchase and your done.

Mtgox ...... and SR are all protected by different passwords and logins so it kind of adds a separate layer of protection. I really hope you get things sorted out ......

I came here to see if there was a solution to reclaiming my account but also to provide a warning to keep strong PW and pins to others. People can BS all they want and I dont blame them for not believing what im saying. But I do know the facts, and that&#039;s why im telling others to be more careful than myself...<br /><br />It does say a lot about a community that when you have a shitting thing happen to you and then try to use that thing to help others, peoples reaction is to immediately jump down your throat, insist your wrong and that don&#039;t have a clue what your talking about, even Mods... That just strikes me as very odd. <br /><br />To answer a few of your concerns, I did not forget my login info. I appreciate your help and suggestion to look at it with a clear mind, but I never had anything other than a clear clam mind. I don&#039;t know how to put it more clearly but I know what my login info is, and it simply no longer works. #1 I wrote it down and im looking at the paper now that has worked 100% of the time until that one day, and not since. #2 Ive tried every possible combination that I could have altered, capp&#039;ed etc... #3 It was a VERY f&#039;ing simple PW, a 6 yr old couldn&#039;t have forgotten or typed it wrong... Which brings me back to my main point, Since I can say with 100% certainty I did not access another url outside of the ONLY one i saved to access SR, I&#039;m pretty sure someone guessed my PW, and guessed correctly. I assumed like many of these doubters who (are telling me I don&#039;t know what im saying) even a simple PW would take WAY to long to crack. Well it didn&#039;t in my case. I&#039;m not placing blame on anyone but myself for not making a stronger PW, but the bottom line is, im not the Jackass who (by whatever means) broke into someone else&#039;s account and changed their PW.<br /><br />As a few mentioned I shouldn&#039;t have kept btc in my account. Well I don&#039;t keep btc in my account. It just so happened that I had 2 vendors cancel orders on me and another 2 orders &quot;pending&quot; with no response (that I can assume may have been also canceled) and right before my account went under the btc were transferred back to my account... No inside jobs here, Im the only person that uses my computer. This was a simple case of me assuming I could get by with only a weak PW... Anyway thanks for the unassuming response, among some unreasonable and assuming posters.<br /><br />To anyone else that&#039;s reading this and feel like telling me how right you are and how dumb I am, you can rest assured I wont be reading your post.&nbsp; I retort, this post was to call attention to the need for a response to recover any lost account (regardless of how it was lost or stolen) AND to tell you to keep strong Logins and Passwords ALWAYS even when you think its not necessary! <br /><br />&nbsp;

				The way I see it, one of two things has happened.. <br /><br />Either you logged in at a phishing site, or you have malicious software on your PC logging your passwords.<br /><br />Since you&#039;re adamant that you&#039;ve only used the correct URL, have you looked into the possibility of keylogging?&nbsp; <br /><br />As others have said, it&#039;s highly unlikely that your account was straight hacked. <br /><br />Does anyone else know your password? Could anyone have seen you enter it?<br /><br />If it were me, I&#039;d be scanning for keylog programs like a maniac about now...

				My account has been stable since 8 months, and I believe this is one of the most trustworthy websites.<br /><br />I often have trouble logging in, I type correct name and password a few times and it simply rejects me, even when I try multiple times.<br />An hour or a day later it would work again. Must be a cookie or Tor thing.<br /><br />Hamburgler, perhaps try again some hours later or perhaps try &quot;changing your identity&quot; on Tor. Or, delete the SR related cookies in your browser.<br /><br />And yes I&#039;m always checking the URL (of ANY site) when I type my logins - I&#039;m very aware of those phishers ;)
