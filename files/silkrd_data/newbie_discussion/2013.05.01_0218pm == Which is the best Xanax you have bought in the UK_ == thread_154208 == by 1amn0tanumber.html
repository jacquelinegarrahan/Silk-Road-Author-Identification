				Which is the best Xanax you have bought in the UK?<br />I recently bought fifty but they are duds. I trust the vendor. Maybe he has been done over. Who knows. The rest of his stuff is great. I won&#039;t mention his name until the matter is resolved, but I need real Xanax. Which is your favourite? Not a good feeling being without them, just incase you need one.
