				my order from a vendor has been processing for about 3 days now and if I hover over the cancel button it says &quot;5 days until cancel&quot;.Is there a way I can cancel before this time or do I have to wait for the vendor to ship(If they ever do)<br />Btw.the vendor has great feedback and has been online every day but still processing.I have pm them but no reply.<br />What to do? If anything before the 5day wait to cancel?

				After 4 full days have passed from the time of the original order (96 hours), the cancel link becomes enabled. I think the only other way to cancel is to message the vendor and have them do it.<br /><br />Also check the vendor&#039;s profile and see if they only ship on certain days. That might explain why they haven&#039;t shipped yet.

				Has the vendor been online? Considering the recent outages, he/she may have shipped and not marked it in transit. The road has been stable for a couple of days now, so I would expect the vendor to have shipped by now. I&#039;d think it would be safe to cancel it, but if it were me, I&#039;d ask the vendor what&#039;s up and give them a day or so to respond before cancelling.<br /><br />&nbsp;BTC has dropped lately. If you cancel this order now, your coins will have lost some purchasing power.

				Yep just wait, if it isn&#039;t changed to shipped just cancel if you really want to, a lot of vendors are taking their time because of BTC volatility and SR has been on the fritz because of DDOS.
