				Title: <strong>25b compared to 25i?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve only ever tried 25i, and usually in very large doses (3-5mg at times) and my visuals have been incredibly intense, yet my body is usually very stiff for a while, but loosens up as time goes on.<br /><br />I tried looking up 25b, and couldn&#039;t find much. Anyone here have any personal experiences they&#039;d like to share? From what I read it sounds really interesting, but again, it wasn&#039;t much to go off of.

				25b has less body load, not as speedy as 25i, and has a nice mixture of visual and audio distortion. It&#039;s more potent so start with 2mg. Come-up is only 40 minutes so you can take another tab around the 30 minute mark if it&#039;s not as strong as you were hoping. <br /><br />I find it very euphoric, a good deal of music appreciation and empathy, better visuals than with 25i (though I never took anywhere near your doses, lol). <br /><br />It&#039;s one of my favorites next to 25d.

				Hmm so two hits you&#039;d recommend? I&#039;m curious about the audio distortion actually, seeing as the only time shit got weird on 25i was when it was completely silent and I could hear the water trickling through the plumbing, and my friend breathing in the other room. What happens to sounds if you can pinpoint it? <br /><br />I read your link in your signature too. 4 hour trip? That sounds really short, but I&#039;m assuming for a 500ug dose that should be expected.<br /><br />Thanks for your reply man.

It&#039;s about 6 hours on 1mg if I remember correctly (been taking a break so can&#039;t quite remember). <br /><br />The audio distortion shifts a bit. Sometimes it&#039;s like superheaing --zoom in and out of various ambient noises like you describe with the 25i. Other times it can be similar to the echo affects you get on acid though not as much as acid (more subtle).

Thanks for being helpful man. I think I&#039;ll just start with a 1mg dose for starters. Sighhh<br /><br />Oh and this may be asking you to recollect a bit much, but did it have that strong chemical taste like 25i did? Or is that found across all nbome&#039;s?

Candy and nbomes go together pretty well, especially the fruity ones. Popsicles can also be a nice treat. <br /><br />Also, remember that come-up is pretty fast so if you&#039;re not where you want to be in 30 to 40 minutes, you can take more without tolerance issues. I typically take two half-doses with this one so the come-up isn&#039;t so intense.

I just bared with the taste.. Fuck.<br />I know what you mean about the come-up though. I remember the 25i kicking in in less than 20 minutes before. I usually get good and situated before I take any kind of hallucinogen.

Two tabs under my tongue. Believe me, I was just as shocked as you. I remember smoking a cigarette, and shortly after, I noticed a shadow kind of dancing and thought to myself, &quot;No fucking way am I tripping already.&quot;<br /><br />Sure enough, I was.
