				Good to be here - just letting you guys know I&#039;m listing a very small amount of my own lovely W33D! <br /><br />I&#039;m just a passionate small scale organic farmer and have a little left over so think that people here might enjoy it...in fact I know they will ;) I might do more but it&#039;s strictly for friends + not some huge operation!<br /><br />No big deal, but any tips on getting it out there and for a beginner would be gratefully received :)<br /><br />Thanks guys<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I believe the usual way of getting the ball to roll is to offer free or cheap samples, preferably to people who have been here for a while (ie. not a newbie like me&nbsp; :) ). It&#039;s not great, but people will be reluctant to trade with you as long as there is no info about your product and practices and so on. It&#039;s also a good way of sorting out any kinks with your packaging and such before you really get going.

				Also, once a few people have ordered and received your product you should make a thread for a product review page where your customers can talk about how dank it is, how good the packaging was, etc... <br /><br />~PsychedelicO

Best of luck with your new store! Perhaps consider placing your vendor link in your signature so as people can find you more easily? :)<br /><br />Libertas
