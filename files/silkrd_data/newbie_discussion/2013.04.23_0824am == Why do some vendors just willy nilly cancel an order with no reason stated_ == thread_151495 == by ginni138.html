				Doing this to new people, with no reason or rationale, seems like a great way to create anger, enemies, and much ill will.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Do some of these guys just get real cocky, or is that cooky, too big for their pants?&nbsp; Honestly, seems like another example of a big fish in a little pond. The man-about-town in a tiny Podunk farm town. No matter where you go, it is just the same, base, silly, and fatuous human element.&nbsp; So unprofessional and so clannish, like a gathering of sweaty, drunken fish wives.&nbsp; Jesus.

				I know the feeling, but you have to understand it can&#039;t be too easy to take your first steps into a community like this... Maybe you didnt read their profile in detail? Or maybe you did and they said nothing, but didnt feel like taking the risk.<br /><br />You can see I&#039;m a noob too, but I can already tell you that you will find sellers who can accept newcomers and it will all go well, also others will cancel no matter what.<br /><br />Probably a bit of prior communication can help, we have to understand that building trust is not easy, and for a seller, a new buyer is also a (probable) high risk, sure higher risk than an old-timer.<br /><br />So, cool down, maybe try to communicate a bit, and accept the first steps will take their time... I havent been here for long either but already found some really cool ppl around, its worth the time!<br /><br />
