				Hello all!<br /><br />I am fairly new to SR (only one order so far), but wanted to warn everyone about DoctorFreedom. I thought it would be helpful that others would know of my experience.<br /><br />I ordered Diflucan from DoctorFreedom for a yeast infection (since no one knows me here, it doesn&#039;t embarrass me to talk about it). I don&#039;t have insurance, and found out that the doctor appointment and the prescription, without insurance, would cost me roughly about $200; therefore, I took a friend&#039;s advice and looked for some here.<br /><br />DoctorFreedom was one of only two vendors here selling Diflucan: both vendors were not in the States). I was wary of ordering from another country, but, being desperate, I took a chance.<br /><br />First of all, the product took about 22 days to arrive, but I survived. Then, I have tried taking the product for about 2 weeks, but to no avail. I&#039;m very accustomed to taking Diflucan: it&#039;s always worked for me. Even though the meds didn&#039;t look like the Diflucan I&nbsp; normally take, I took a chance on it. Therefore, I still had to pay full price at a doctor&#039;s office, and at the pharmacy, to rid myself of this problem. In the end, I ended up spending about 3 times what I gave DoctorFreedom for his product, whatever it was.<br /><br />We went through the resolution process, and the administrators decided to give me 0% refund. DoctorFreedom wanted to give me extra product on other orders, but I told him that, given that the first product I ordered from him was ineffective, I saw no reason to order any other products in future.<br /><br />Just thought you all should know ... <br /><br />Modified to add that Diflucan is a product with which my body is quite familiar, and for which my body normally responds quite quickly and well. I also have not begun taking any new medicines (if I had, it might justifiably be argued that the meds might have interfered with the Diflucan).

				Now that I&#039;ve spent a lot more money on a doctor&#039;s appointment and Diflucan from the pharmacy (with no insurance) - close to $200 - yes, thank you.

				Well, I&#039;m an ER nurse and best advice I can give you is this: just go to the ER. It&#039;s not an emergency and everyone in health care absolutely hates people that clog up the system, but that IS the system. Most places will only hold prescriptions for non-essential medications (like narcotics). Some don&#039;t even do that. You&#039;ll avoid paying for a doctor&#039;s visit and cut straight to paying for the drug. Don&#039;t worry about having a &quot;bill&quot; there. They can&#039;t legally turn you away (if it&#039;s a not for profit, which most hospitals are).<br /><br />Some people feel guilty about doing this, but until we have a universal health care system, fuck guilt. The system is broken, use it accordingly until they&#039;re forced to fix it.
