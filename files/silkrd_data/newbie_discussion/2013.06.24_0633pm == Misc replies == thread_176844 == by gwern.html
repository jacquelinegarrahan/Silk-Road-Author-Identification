				I&#039;m stuck as a newbie, so I&#039;m posting here. If some kind forum user would copy or link my comments into the respective<br />&nbsp;threads, I&#039;d be grateful.<br />---<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175703.0<br /><br />I agree. The search is *awful*. Here is a real example: I was searching for the user &quot;Truckin&quot;, which turns up nothing. I discover the actual user name is &quot;-Truckin-&quot;; ok, that&#039;s a seriously crappy search because &#039;Truckin&#039; is obviously a substring of &#039;-Truckin-&#039;. But whatever; I search for &#039;-Truckin-&#039; - *zero* hits. The user has 30 posts! WTF?!<br /><br />---<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176338.0<br /><br />&gt; Well.. because it&#039;s been updated recently.. At the top of the article it tells us that the most recent update was on the 19th of June.<br /><br />Yes; that update was for adding a link to my de-anonymizing of the active SR vendor Casey Jones (specifically, http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1gxiv7/srrelated_bitcoin_seizure/caoxlmg ).<br /><br />&gt; I don&#039;t know when the quoted paragraphs were added to the article. I have no access to the document history..&nbsp; so i can&#039;t diff the various versions. Were they added before or after the DoS attacks suffered by SR ?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.<br /><br />You can check revisions in the Internet Archive: http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road The paragraphs in question were originally added 16 September 2012 (you can verify this in the first October archive: http://web.archive.org/web/20121006004502/http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road ), that is, before the DoS attacks. I&#039;m a little proud of &#039;calling it&#039; like that.<br /><br />I&#039;d also point out that later on I write:<br /><br />&gt; SR&#039;s administrator stated (http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/21/3675278/silk-road-operator-says-fail-whale-not-feds-brought-down-notorious) the downtime was due to &quot;record&quot; numbers of users; but if large numbers of legitimate users can accidentally take down the site, clearly a full-fledged DoS attack is feasible. A real DoS attack by a single attacker in April 2013 degraded access for a week and essentially blocked all access for ~2 days (http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1d569v/the_dread_pirate_roberts_discounts_all_items_on/), prompting SR to suspend its commissions for several days to encourage purchases.<br /><br />---<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176320.0<br /><br />&gt; I think this was an SR vendor. Look at the nick name, &quot;Casey Jones&quot;. He is indeed a vendor, but apparently in stealth mode. Here&#039;s his vendor page. <br /><br />Sorry hypnotick, but I beat you to this last night :) See http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1gxiv7/srrelated_bitcoin_seizure/caoxlmg Incidentally, after I posted that I messaged Jones both here and on SR, so there&#039;s no need for anyone else to ping him with warnings. Personally, I&#039;m shocked he is still using the account, selling or buying, even after a run in with the government and now having been de-anonymized; if nothing else, he&#039;s putting his customers at risk. Maybe there should be a SR policy against doing (illegal) business while having been linked or de-anonymized.
