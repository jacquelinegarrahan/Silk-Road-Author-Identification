				Are you using this URL? - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/ <br /><br />Once you log on to SR, bookmark the page so you have the correct address saved. If your on Tor and enter the above Silk Road URL, there is no reason why you wouldn&#039;t be able to log on to SR. I&#039;m currently on it.&nbsp; :)

				Right, if you ever logged in anywhere other than http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/&nbsp; then you were at a scam site.<br /><br />Did it ever ask you for your PIN when you logged in? If yes you were at a scam site. If you did enter your genuine username, password, and PIN, hopefully you didn&#039;t have any BTC in your account, because it will be gone.

				I am assuming you are using silkroadvb5piz3r.onion and not silkroad.vb5piz3r.onion - as that would not work&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Have you had any other issues whilst using TOR?

				If you used a link instead of bookmark be careful and change info if you are able to get back in. IF a new account with no BTC uploaded then start a new one. I would delete TOR bundle download again and try with links given in thread.
