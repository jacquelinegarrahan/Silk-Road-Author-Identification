				Hello,<br />I&#039;m a newbie and just placed my first two small orders with two different vendors about 12 hours ago.&nbsp; My order page says &quot;processing&quot;.&nbsp; How long does it usually take to fill an order?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t use PGP because I don&#039;t understand it.<br />Thanks,<br />winedrinker<br />

				Any good vendor should have your order shipped in 1-3 days but it is usually quicker then that.<br /><br />Also lean how to use PGP it&#039;s not very hard. Here is a tutorial: http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/ <br />You didn&#039;t just write your address in clear text did you?

				Probably not screwed but it is just a bad idea. If I was you I would learn PGP now and maybe even set up a new account so it is not associated with the old one.

				Learn how to use PGP and practice it in the stickied thread of this forum (make a new key for this! dont use the same key on SR and the forums!). That way, you won&#039;t waste a vendor&#039;s time when they fail to decrypt your message and have to tell you that you PGP&#039;ed wrong. <br /><br />After that, always encrypt your address and other sensitive information. Avoid vendors who do not use PGP. Always use your real name and address unless you have a sophisticated scheme to use another address. Triple check your address before encrypting and check it against the standard mail address format which can be found through a google search.

				You&#039;re far from screwed, but like others have said, it&#039;s not difficult so learn to use it.

				Some vendors often mark it as &quot;in transit&quot; the same day or next day (depending on time you ordered). But there are others I&#039;ve ordered from who take as much as 3 days to dispatch. Try to know when you&#039;ll need your drugs at least 2 weeks in advance, this way you have time to sort your Bitcoins out, transfer them, make the order, wait for the vendor to send it and wait for the postal service to deliver it. It usually takes less than that. I&#039;ve had orders in the space of two days, but just in case, you should always plan ahead. SR does go down, and popular vendors do get swamped sometimes with a backlog of orders.

				@Yokes101<br /><br />I was reading another post about an Irish fella looking for an Ireland based vendor and you gave him some advice. Unfortunately due to my newbie status I couldn&#039;t add my 2 cents to that thread.<br /><br />But I&#039;m glad I got this opportunity to say hello, its great to be part of this community. If you believe everything you read then Silk Road is full of schemers and scammers and of course that couldn&#039;t be further from the truth.<br /><br />I guess we&#039;ll be bumping into each other around here more, really looking forward to it too!
