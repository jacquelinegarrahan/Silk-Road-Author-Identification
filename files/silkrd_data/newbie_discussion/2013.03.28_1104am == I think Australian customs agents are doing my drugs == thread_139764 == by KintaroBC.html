				Every time I order speed it never arrives. Lots of stuff never arrived. MDPV arrives but seems to have been tampered with, I don&#039;t think they like the smell or know what it is. Also, they wouldn&#039;t want the fun to stop or me to give up on the road. I&#039;ll know definitively because I&#039;m going to get photos of the next order being opened and the bag. I think someone has been into it and the opening would be a lot cleaner. It used to be from one of the same vendors.<br /><br />I&#039;ll know definitively soon but fuck, I think a couple of customs agents are railing my speed right now. Fucking corrupt cunts. As much as I like digital anarchy, we need a proper Government. Thugs will be thugs, Government or not.<br /><br />Edit: my general feeling is &quot;I BEEN VIOLATED.&quot;

If we passed a normal law that said &quot;death for doing cunts drugs,&quot; firstly we might as well just legalize drugs, secondly they are people who believe fear is a virtue and this would probably actually stop them and they would still be around to commit rapes and other brutality.

So I think the market is basically people without drug dealers who will pay for weed. Also it is fucking extremely good weed. I&#039;ve never ordered it but I&#039;ve been in the weed business. It takes quite a while to have a constant supply of pure breeds and really good weed. Even my supply get&#039;s fucked for a while.<br /><br />Also I just don&#039;t do weed anymore I&#039;m pretty much anti-weed just not in a legal sense. I don&#039;t think it is good for anyone.

They know kicking in my door is a waste of time. I store elsewhere and do little bits. Most they can get me for is possession. I&#039;m no regular user even. The court system here is weak as a cat&#039;s bladder. I have a mental illness so I&#039;ll probably just get diversion (no court case, no criminal record, no charges) and just have to do some program.

				I think you will find your mail man/ mail room guy knows what your up too. He/she are helping themselves when they can identify the product. As for expensive Australian drugs on the road... High prices mean that when i want something it will be there for sale. Im happy to pay top dollar for the convenience of not having to deal with junkies and getting a fairly consistent quality.
