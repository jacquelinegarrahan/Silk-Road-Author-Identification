				On the Silk Road as a practical libertarian system:[/font]<br />[/font][/font]<br />“Silk Road was founded on libertarian principles and continues to be operated on them. It is a great idea and a great practical system…It is not a utopia. It is regulated by market forces, not a central power (even I am subject to market forces by my competition. No one is forced to be here). The same principles that have allowed Silk Road to flourish can and do work anywhere human beings come together. The only difference is that the State is unable to get its thieving murderous mitts on it.” <br />[/font]<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=46460.msg496906#msg496906)[/font]<br />On the War on Drugs: (In response to criticisms from another user who said that Silk Road hasn’t affected the War on Drugs)[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“Silk Road has already made an impact on the war on drugs. The effect of the war is to limit people’s access to controlled substances. Silk Road has expanded people’s access. The great thing about agorism is that it is a victory from a thousand battles. Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction. So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state.” <br />[/font]<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=16070.msg482240#msg482240)[/font]On the potential for drug cartels to form on Silk Road:[/font]<br />[/font][/font]<br />“Cartels are nearly impossible to maintain without the use of violence, especially in an environment as competitive as Silk Road. There is also nothing morally wrong with them. If a cartel were to form, I would not attempt to break it up unless its members were breaking other rules. If you want an explanation for why cartels are nearly impossible to maintain in a free market environment, please read “Man, Economy and State” chapter 10, part 2, section D.” <br />[/font]<br /><br /><br />###<br />End Part II, cont&#039;d in Part III<br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=135769.msg922288#msg922288)[/font]<br />&nbsp;
