				If you were about to cap out a bunch of MDMA how would you typically do it. I used to buy and sell pressed pills but since I found SR and a source for legit rocks I am going to start making my own caps. <br />1. How much would you put in each cap if you were selling them for retail at like a festival?<br />2. What would you put in your personal caps?<br /><br />I am thinking about buying an O and putting like .14 in each cap because this seems like a good amount to me to sell as a roll yet it&nbsp; seems like most people don&#039;t sell this amount<br />For myself and close friends I am thinking about doing like .14 MDMA and .05MDA.<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				0&#039;s will be way to big I just got my self some 3&#039;s which should hold around 0.18-0.19g have not tried them yet will be trying them sometime this week but they look the same size if not a little bigger than caps I have gotten previously.<br /><br />NewspaperBoy

				Ahh yes that was a misunderstanding, i meant an ounce as in 28g&#039;s but now i see how that could have been so easily misinterpreted. yes I agree that that would be too bulky of a cap. Do you fill all yours by hand or do you have a machine for them?

				1. 120mg a cap is usually the average, 2mg per kg of a persons weight is a good gauge. <br />2. 2mg per kg of your weight but everyone is different plus there is tolerance to consider so it might be more or less for you.<br /><br />Depends if you make a lot as it can be time consuming.

				That seems like a good dose for yourself .14g mdma and .05g mda, but for retail i&#039;d go for .1g is enough. most people cant even handle that much of pure mdma, plus kids at festivals would eat those caps like skittles and more likely to redose. So 0.1g is much more manageable&nbsp; for retail. <br /><br />as for the proper cap size, what is a good size for capping? been using a cap machine to cap my dietary supplements, but its for &quot;00&quot; capsules and they seem way too bulky. If filled with a proper single dose, it would only fill 1/3 of the cap. Dumb kids would think you are being stringent on the supply wondering why their caps are all barely half full.

				If you get the really pure shit from SR, I&#039;d say anywhere from .1g-.13g is probably good. More than that can be overkill with the uncut stuff IMO.

				Just reinforcing what everyone else has said, selling fatter caps may put you at risk when you are moving product around. Especially if you become that person that is always ready to move some product and one of your regulars friends has one and gets overloaded.<br /><br />I think 125mg seems to be the &quot;standard dose&quot; or as stated before 2mg/kg. 150mg of pure uncut MDMA should be a decent roll for most people who aren&#039;t abusing it.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to go through the hassle of carrying custom sizes make 75mg the standard and sell them in groups of 2 or whatever.<br /><br />Any larger and you risk people taking the clean product and over-reacting when they have a harder roll then they were expecting from their typical and (presumably) cut product.<br /><br />

				I take .2 and then 1 hour later .1 personally (I still have it all separated in 100 mg caps)<br /><br />when I sell (mind you I don&#039;t sell at festivals) I put in .1 but usually ends up being more like .11 and I sell it for ten dollars a cap.<br /><br />in a number 4 cap 100 - 110 mg will fit perfectly, get size 3 for a bigger dosage.<br />

				many good thoughts :) you guys are right though that people would rather see a 1.1 in a small cap compared to 1.4 in a large one. Also where I am from at events the majority of people consume at least 1 or 2 100+mg pills with a good synth they just use molly because it feels &quot;cleaner&quot; to boost with. its very hard to explain but people around me are no noobs to rolling balls. i don&#039;t know maybe my perception is skewed maybe i am just high
