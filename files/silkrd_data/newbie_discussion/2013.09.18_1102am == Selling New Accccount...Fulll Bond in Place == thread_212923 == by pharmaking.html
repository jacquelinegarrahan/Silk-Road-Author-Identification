				the guy who tried to buy my account has again posted his same derogatory an inflammatory remarks on my vendor page...this is the third time...the first two times the vendors removed these inappropriate posts...I trust they will do so very quickly again...<br /><br />As I said the account has zero sales and that is easy to verify....I also have enlisted one of the most senior and trusted members on SR to act as middleman in selling this account...he will sell the account...not me...once I have a buyer....<br /><br />if this disgruntled buyer wants to buy the account he can buy it from this senior member who is one of the most respected figures here on SR.<br /><br />I canceled his order after vendor support informed me that it is not a good idea to sell an account without FE...for which I do not qualify...because I have zero sales...<br /><br />I explained to him very politely my reason for canceling his order...on the advice of vendor support...they suggested I find a trusted friend who is a senior member who can sell the account for me...and that is what I have done...<br /><br />If this guys is really willing to pay for the account why does he not say yes he will buy the account from the senior member...? big question mark there...because he would have to pay FE...<br /><br />So he can still buy the account....from one of the most prominent and trusted members on SR...so whats the problem...?... naturally he would have to pay FE...the ball is his court.. <br /><br />I have been polite and respectful all along...I just cannot trust to hand over keys to my account without getting a penny first...no reasonable person would do such a thing...<br /><br />As for his comments on my vendor page it is all bs...yes I could open a sub account but funds cannot be transferred from the main account to a sub account...like he claims...vendor support confirms this fact...I would still have to sell the account by giving him the passwords first...and then hoping he will pay...<br /><br />All of this is fact...unlike his made up story about how he could buy my account without me giving him the PIN...<br /><br />he says I could then transfer the proceeds of the sale to my subaccount...but vendor support strongly advises against that...and recommended a solution where a trusted senior members sells the account for me FE...<br /><br />That is exactly what I have done..anyone can buy the account...not from me but from one of the most respected members here who has agreed to&nbsp; sell the account from his own vendor account...<br /><br />So here is my challenge to you ST Ananas...why don&#039;t you go ahead and buy the account...?...just post a message here or send me a PM that you want the account (at the lowered price of $300) and this respected senior member will sell it to you...<br /><br />But I already know your answer...you are pissed because you thought you could get my account for free...there is no way in the world you actually going to pay FE and do an honest transaction...even with one of the most senior and respected members here...<br /><br />I&#039;m calling your bluff...let&#039;s see what happens.<br />
