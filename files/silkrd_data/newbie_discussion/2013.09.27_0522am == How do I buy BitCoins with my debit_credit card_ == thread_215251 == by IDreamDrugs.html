				IDREAM, i could help you out if you would like. This is how you can do it through me, although im going to charge you 5-10% for my time. You could use your credit/debit to buy a moneypak card at a local store, and wire me the code in a message. I&#039;ll then use my paypal, and my method of getting BTC through paypal and send the funds after i get them to my ewallet. Though this method can take up to 48hours the way i do it, but I definitely wouldn&#039;t mind helping out someone in the SR family as i have been helped here so much :) BTC can be a real big headache at first, but you&#039;ll get it. If you&#039;d like to try using me just send me a message or something, you can start off with the smallest amount possible so you&#039;re not going out on a limb to trust me and we can work from there.

You want to use a card that is linked to your name, social security number, and home address to purchase btc? Is that correct? If so, it&#039;s not smart. And for the same reason, DO NOT do a bank transfer and then immediately transfer the coins to your SR address. That&#039;s just way too easy to trace back to you. You might as well just use Dwolla if you&#039;re going to be that obvious.<br /><br />Even if you buy a prepaid card, btcquick will accept credit/debit cards, but they still require that you verify your identity. It&#039;s just not smart. Plus there are very low limits on the amount you can purchase per day <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just need to find somewhere where I can directly buy BitCoins and have them transferred directly into my SilkRoad address.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I used to use bitinstant, but since they&#039;ve disappeard, I&#039;ve been using localbitcoins.com. They have seller rankings and escrow just like SR. I have had nothing but good experiences and have had my coins within minutes (45 minutes was the longest I&#039;ve had to wait). <br /><br />tl;dr Always buy bitcoin with case or other untraceable methods, especially if you&#039;re going to transfer them straight to SR. If you&#039;re just an &quot;investor&quot; then it would be OK to do what you want, but I doubt that&#039;s the case.

				Hi,<br /><br />btcQuick is the easiest to use. When you register, they will ask you to send a tif file photo of the credit card that you will be using, and a copy of your drivers license. Once set up is complete, you just go online to btcquick.com and follow the directions. BTC will withdraw the amount you requested, and they will send it to your new wallet, which is Blockchain. I would stay with them, because they are honest and fast. You will be able to send the bitcoin to whatever address you choose.&nbsp;

Why on Earth would you send a copy of your driver&#039;s license if the goal&nbsp; is to remain anonymous. It&#039;s like committing a felony at the police station!<br /><br />I&#039;m not proud of this, but about a year and a half ago I was short a coin or two (this was back when btc traded for between $5-15) and once I bought a few coins on my CC from btcquick. I only spent like $20 bucks. At that time, they didn&#039;t require verification and it was only a tiny amount, so I don&#039;t sweat it. But I wouldn&#039;t do it now that they are verifying. That&#039;s why I&#039;ll never use Mt Gox again.<br /><br />Side note: If bitinstant ever comes back, it&#039;s easy to fake their verification.
