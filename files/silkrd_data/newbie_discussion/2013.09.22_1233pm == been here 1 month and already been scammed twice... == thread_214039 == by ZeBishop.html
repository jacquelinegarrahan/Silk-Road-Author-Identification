				hey guys, Im new user here, had a few succesful transactions and if i must say... the best coke ive ever tried.. BUT i have already been scammed by 2 REPUTABLE vendor&#039;s.... Both of them seem to have been TOP vendor&#039;s with GREAT reviews and stats... But at the time i ordere&#039;d they both seem to have decided they are gunna run, And make everyone FE and not send shit..... K.Queen and GlobalDealer.... Is this just extremely bad luck?? or is it normal to have TOP vendor&#039;s deciding to suicide so often? Any advice would be great

				Yep. Do NOT FE.<br /><br />Read, learn and inwardly digest until you have it lodged firmly in your brain.<br /><br />The general advice for newbies who have to have a certain amount of successful transactions to buy is just buy a pile of those cheapo downloadable books. Then voila, you&#039;re good to get on the drug listings.

				I was just asking if it was common for these vendor&#039;s to do the runner and screw everyone over... But now you mention it, Nearly EVERY vendor for coke / mdma will NOT ship to AUS without FE..... So you telling me NOT to FE.... Dosen&#039;t make sense.. Can i simply just order anyway and refuse to FE? and expect my order to be filled.... I know i should be able to stay in escrow aslong as there is a tracking number and we can both proved what happened, and yet EVERY vendor profile either says they DONT SHIP TO AUS, or if they do, ITS FE AND OUR OWN RISK..............

				If you did that the Vendor would simply cancel your order.<br /><br />Best idea is to PM vendors which have the goodies you are after.&nbsp; Have a conversation with them - they are REAL people and will understand your questions / predicament, etc <br /><br />Any Vendo worth his salt will be able to AT LEAST come to some compromise of risk without need to FE.<br /><br />If you are after very POTENT DMT for example, we ME&#039;s would definitely do business with you and we provide excellent and constant updates, etc <br /><br />Just like the majority of great Vendors on here who have changed their attitude to the EXCELLENT Escrow System.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINEELVES

				Thanks for the warning. I plan to never FE, they pretty well drill that into your brain here in the Newbie section. I understand your predicament though, I hear that AUS is a pain to get anything shipped to. Only thing I can say is try your best to find vendors that don&#039;t require FE, however I understand that might be difficult in your location. I guess just ask yourself if you can afford to lose the BTC if you must endure the crapshoot of FE&#039;ing. Comb through their reviews, but I guess as you&#039;ve learned that doesn&#039;t always matter... Best of luck to you.

				I think it&#039;s the fact that you live in Oz that makes it so tricky. The customs teams there are nasty.<br /><br />Good luck anyway bro. Hope you find good vendors you can purchase from.
