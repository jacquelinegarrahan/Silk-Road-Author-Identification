				Does anyone know what the future will bring for SR??<br />Is it the Intendt for SR to be featured on Forbes etc or does SR or the SR communnity prefer to keep this to themself.<br /><br />To me I didnt tell anyone of my friends about SR and I cant see myself telling anyone about it.<br /><br />Can SR release some numbers about monthly average visitors to the site??<br />And are there more users from the States or Europe, if it is possible to say.

				I don&#039;t tell anyone about it, but, sometimes its tempting specially when intoxicated.&nbsp; I like the hoops you have to go through.&nbsp; It took me a year after hearing about darknet and SR before I bothered downloading tor bundle.&nbsp; For some, the hoops are enough of a deterrent.<br /><br />As for SR: one thing is sure, nothing lasts forever.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just enjoy it while its here.&nbsp; And keep on the lookout for whatever replaces it.

I&#039;m technically very proficient, but I just didn&#039;t bother for a long time. I&#039;ve always been ingrigued, but only decided to just see what the fuss was about after reading about SR, again, in some bitcoin research I was doing. I have to say, I&#039;m so pleasantly surprised at the community. I would&#039;ve never thought there were so many helpful, cool people in a place called &quot;darknet&quot; that you hear mostly bad things about (pedo bs for instance).

				Maybe I&#039;m more optimistic than most, but I think the future of SR is very bright.<br />Sure, the NSA are a bunch of power-hungry fuckwits but I would imagine they are enjoying all of the recent hysteria.<br />It gives them more control, as fear is the main tool of any fascist regime. (yes I said fascist!)<br />This is all pure speculation, but I doubt they are anywhere near as in control of the web (and especially the darknet) as they would have you believe. Stick to the routine, take all the precautions recommended by this amazing community and lets stand together against tyranny and for freedom.<br />SR ain&#039;t going nowhere ;)
