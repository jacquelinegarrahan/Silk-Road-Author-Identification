				The only Post I did In that time frame what had any non tech content was the one below<br /><br />I am not a big Fan of the POLICE But when i heard about the efforts they are taking to protect the Children<br />from these sick Monsters I think that&#039;s quite a silver Lining.<br />Tor mail should been more careful. But not sure if&nbsp; &nbsp;they could have found out in what horrible company they were in.<br />How could any one want to harm a Child?It is just unconscionable I know if i thought I was a threat&nbsp; to Kids<br />I would Kill myself No doubt<br /><br />Best Wishes<br /><br /><br />If this is the Post I think it is What kind of person what Give me negative karma?<br /><br />I will take their negative&#039;s as a compliment. <br /><br />And no gave me +1&nbsp; &nbsp;Not one?&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps tomorrow I will have&nbsp; -60 LOL

				Yep, me too - I noticed mine and thought christ what have I said - couldn&#039;t figure out what major blunder I must have made in some thread to get -30! But then I clocked that everybody in that particular thread got done. But I remain mystified as to how that is possible. If you give someone karma, you can&#039;t do it again for 72 hours (not sure if you can freely give to others in the meantime or not). However you look at it, either there was a tonne of people deliberately hitting our karma all at once or there is some weird shit going on. <br /><br />It is not the end of the world BUT if I saw our post level and that amount of neg I&#039;d assume we must be trolls. So not ideal....
