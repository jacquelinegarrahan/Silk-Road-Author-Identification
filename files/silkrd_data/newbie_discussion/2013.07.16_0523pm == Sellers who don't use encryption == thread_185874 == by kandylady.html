				Personally, I will only send my address encrypted with PGP and wouldn&#039;t trust a seller who doesn&#039;t use PGP. What other safety measures are they sacrificing if they can&#039;t be bothered to use something as easy as PGP encryption?

				Many sellers will not require PGP, but spend a few minutes chatting with them and you&#039;ll find that the good ones strongly recommend encryption. It&#039;s really simple and could save you in a pinch.

				I always prefer vendors who insist on encryption. Some of them seem to think it&#039;s too time consuming and not worth the bother.&nbsp; As it literally takes seconds to decrypt something, this just tells me the vendor is either very lazy or dumb. In either case, it&#039;s not someone I trust doing business with.

				If the seller does not understand encryption, or does not insist upon it, that tells me that they aren&#039;t serious about their business.

				privnote can be used as an alternative, although I wouldn&#039;t recommend this. You are allowing a third party to potentially snoop in onto your anonymity

				Even PGP isn&#039;t entirely secure and can at the very least link you and the person you&#039;re talking to together (as having exchanged messages). <br /><br />BUYERS, let alone sellers, are absolute fools to not use PGP. I have zero sympathy or tolerance for people whose take is &quot;well I&#039;ve got SO MUCH MONEY COMING IN that I can&#039;t POSSIBLY bother to right click, copy, paste, decrpyt, and then paste. <br /><br />In light of the careless Germans who probably have 100s, if not 1000s of plaintext addresses, on file and seized during a bust, I&#039;d wise up.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a sign of laziness, plain and simple. Privnote is just as pointless as plaintext. Sellers that don&#039;t use PGP are basically saying:<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t give a shit about whether you get caught since I&#039;m the one dumping a package in the mail with some fake return address and it&#039;s your ass if you get caught. PS - I don&#039;t have 30 seconds to spend on you on your order.&quot;<br /><br />

				are idiots. Not because it&#039;s unsafe, but because it&#039;s literally soooooo easy to use PGP.

				Personally I wouldn&#039;t buy from a vendor who doesn&#039;t use PGP, everything that goes through Tor is intercepted and stored at NSA data-centers (and other agencies) and can be used against us. And what about if a vendors PC get&#039;s seized.<br /><br />So why not make their job harder and encrypt personal info!? Be safe Roader&#039;s

				If you haven&#039;t read about ze Germans being careless, junkie travelers and getting busted, it&#039;s a good wake up call. <br /><br />Posting here is not even the best thing in the world, but having moved in to the world of harm reduction, I just don&#039;t respect somebody who doesn&#039;t have time to spend 15-20 seconds on you. Yeah yeah they&#039;re the ones with the supply and etc etc etc, but without buyers they have no money. Without a good rep, they have nothing. <br /><br />They&#039;re the online version of people who try to get to do something in public place and are in a hurry and don&#039;t have time to let you see what you&#039;re paying for. Because it&#039;s not what you paid for.

				Instead of the much hyped Privnote, try the Self-Destructing Message instead:<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.destructingmessage.com/<br /><br />You can change how long the person has to read the message before it self-destructs.
