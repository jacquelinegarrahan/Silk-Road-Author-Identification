				Hi beatthebounds, Did you escrow or FE ?&nbsp; Do you mind sharing if you are shipping to the USA ?&nbsp; I looked at old feedback and not too many people have left feedback for the orders shipped from turkey.&nbsp; I am hoping you have good luck.&nbsp; <br /><br />Would anyone mind helping me get set-up to make my first buy ?&nbsp; I opened a Mt-Gox account and I am trying to learn how to get Bitcoins purchased and transferred into my SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />It also seems like the best vendors do not love taking orders from Newbies with low or no purchase history.<br /><br />thanks AW78

				he is a scam in my opinion. he said he wont sell domestic. which i believe is the most stupid thing i ve heard. domestic means no customs no narcotics. 100 % guarantee arrival. but he says my rules no domestic.<br /><br />i dont buy it

				Boy I hope to ....... you lot are wrong about this vendor but if your rite I&#039;ve just lost out like $2K&nbsp; £1K. I just hope he ain&#039;t a scammer if so this should not be allowed ie someone opening up a vendors account then being able to open up other accounts and send money round n round in a circle back to himself so he can write dodgy feedback which shouldve been stopped after all these security measures ie vendors being allowed to scam with impunity anyway I just hope he&#039;s not a scam otherwise I&#039;m fucked I just hope not

				UPDATE:<br /><br />three weeks ago I placed an order and finalized early $500<br />three weeks later still no package in my box and no reply from DarkBank <br />either he&#039;s in stealth mode as he said he&#039;d be by this date and the package was seized or still in transit<br />or I&#039;ve been scammed for the first time on the road
