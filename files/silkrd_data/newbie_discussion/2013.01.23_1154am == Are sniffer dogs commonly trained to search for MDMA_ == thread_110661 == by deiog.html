				Yes I believe so, it has a far stronger smell than coke. There is a thread in the forums somewhere which specifically has multiple experiments with said trained pooch ;)

				From what I&#039;ve read, there are dogs that can sniff for MDMA. Has there been any evidence to back up the assertion that dogs are specialized to one particular sent or another? Can a dog be trained to detect both MDMA and weed, for example?

				Narcotics dog&#039;s are trained to detect multiple illicit substances. Does this mean that they are fool proof? No, many variables go into play, to trigger a scent &quot;hit&quot;. Fatigue and their human handlers are the two most significant considerations. There is a lot of information on Google. I would suggest reading up on the concept of a &quot;scent cone&quot; or diffusion. If you have ever taken elementary chemistry, you should be familiar with the concept.

There is an interesting Berkley study contradicting the notion of police dog accuracy. The concept of police &quot;false hits&quot; is more common than you think. I wouldn&#039;t really be too concerned about dogs unless I was ordering blow or cannabis or a large amount of MDMA. Think of how much mail goes through the system per day.....

				Yes there are dogs trained to sniff for MDMA. How commonly, I&#039;m not sure - but they exist. If a vendor take the appropriate stealth measures, there shouldn&#039;t be a chance in hell of a dog smelling it.

				They can for sure smell meth and I would think MDMA would smell very similar to a dog.&nbsp; They are both amphetamines.<br /><br />With that said I have gotten orders from the Netherlands which apparently is a flagged country in customs.&nbsp; The package was vacuum sealed so I think this helped.

				Sniffer dogs are trained to smell a very wide array of illegal substances, and narcotics. <br /><br />The only way to beat them is to at least triple vac seal, then MBB and or another heat seal Mylar bag. Even then it would have to get out of the post system in a matter of days before the smell would begin to seep, enough to be detected by drug dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;Also never use another smell to mask that of the illegal substance, such as peanut butter, soaps or shampoos, colognes or perfumes, coffee etc, as those are all red flags for suspicious packs. <br /><br />&nbsp;

Money, firearms, etc..&nbsp; <br /><br />Some dogs are trained purely to detect one thing, others several.<br /><br />Good advice above though, seal seal seal and seal again. And don&#039;t believe all that bollocks about hiding smells with lemon juice or whatever. It&#039;s cobblers.<br /><br />
