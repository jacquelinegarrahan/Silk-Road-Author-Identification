				About 11 years ago i took one blue dolphin and rolled my ass off. But for about 1-2 weeks afterwards i experienced the worst life sucking depression i have ever experienced. I even had muscle and bone pain for a 2 days or so. Seems so extreme it has to be by brain chemistry. Anyone heard of this, was it seratonin syndrome? At the time i was in another country at my sisters because my parents went on vacation and was extremely bored not being home thats the only other factor i can blame for this. But that doesnt account for bone pain?&nbsp; Really want to try it again after looking at all this MDMA on the road.

				The comedown from my first ever ride with Molly was pretty awful.&nbsp; Not two weeks awful, but certainly a good few days.<br /><br />Subsequent experiences have not been anywhere near as bad.&nbsp; But then, the highs haven&#039;t been anywhere near as good either.

				Do your due dilligence before dosing. www.rollsafe.org has a nice checklist of preloading and postloading procedures to get the most out of your roll and minimize the effects of the seratonin depletion. <br /><br />Before I was educated properly I rolled 5 times in one week. (Stupid I know.) After that crippling depression lasted me a few weeks I decided to do things the right way. I only roll every 3 months or so, take plenty of vitamins, and follow pre and postload directions.<br /><br /><br />Happy rolling!

				jediflipping knows whats up, preloading and postloading will help immensely. 5-htp afterwards will help with your depression, and preloading with lots of antioxidants and magnesium will make your roll way better. Taking magnesium for about a week before the roll will also lower your tolerance, and let&#039;s you roll harder with less MDMA, taking less also reduces the negative side effects while maintaining the awesomeness. Grapefruit juice will also help, it&#039;s disable an enzyme which converts MDMA to MDA in your body, MDA is worse for your body so the grapefruit will help, also, the vitamin C is good for you.<br /><br />Popping a tums about half an hour before you roll will help the MDMA absorb more efficiently and completely, so you&#039;ll be taking less, but getting the same amount in your brain, saving money, and it&#039;s better for the rest of your body. on reddit /r/mdma has some good resources in the sidebar as well. Happy rolling :)

You can pre-dose with vitamins etc to make the roll better, longer and the come down seem like a joyous thing.<br /><br />According to that site seratonin syndrome isn&#039;t what you described, it is described thus:<br /><br />Seroronin Syndrome (excess serotonin):generally rapid onset, often within minutes. Increased heart rate, shivering, twitching, overresponsive reflexes, extremely high temperatures. Avoid by being careful with drug interactions (see more below)

				My first roll was a cyan pill, pretty big one aswell. rolled for 5-6 hours - next days i had an after glow, no depression.<br />I think its just the quality of it. <br /><br />I rolled a few more times after and did suffered from a few days of &quot;down&#039;. with different pills.

				I did a lot of MMDA when it first came out, before it was actually commercially available (that was about 30 years ago).&nbsp; It was a white powder/crystal, like cocaine.&nbsp; Wonderful stuff.&nbsp; But years later the reports of damage to serotonin receptors seemed credible enough that, despite all the MMDA on here, I would be afraid to use it.&nbsp; Another thing to keep in mind is that when you are young you have a lot of extra everything, including brain cells.&nbsp; As you get older, damage done when you were young but which was not noticeable then might well become noticeable.&nbsp; So as much as I loved MMDA - and I do think it is one of the nicest psychedelics of all - I won&#039;t use it.&nbsp; I&#039;m a lot older now and am subject to depressions and I wouldn&#039;t want to risk worsening my mental health.&nbsp;
