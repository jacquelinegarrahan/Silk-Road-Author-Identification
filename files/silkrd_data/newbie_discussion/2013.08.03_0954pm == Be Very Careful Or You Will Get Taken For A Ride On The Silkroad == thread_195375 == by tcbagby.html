				I am a handicapped vet (Nam - VP-10) who joined up with Silkroad to get some pot.&nbsp; After figuring out bitcoins, I placed an order with NorCalKing who looked like the biggest and most established pot vender on Silkroad.&nbsp; After several days, when my order was still being &quot;processed&quot; by them, I sent an email which went unanswered.&nbsp; After several more attempts they finially got around to telling me that I cancelled the order with instructions to forward my bitcoins to&nbsp; a third party.&nbsp; &nbsp;These people ripped me a new asshole, and I want to warn all Newbies about these bastards.&nbsp; There are plenty of legitimate pot sources on Silkroad so avoid NorcalKing at all costs, they will not ship ypur order.&nbsp; &nbsp; Email me for proof and copies of their messages.

				Looks like you got sent a message by someone else while your order was processing from NCK. Or did they actually cancel your order where you got your money back?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this is NCK&#039;s fault unless you prove otherwise

				I see your point about it &quot;possibly&quot; not being NCK, but if someone placed an order thru SR for something, how on earth would a third party know that they placed an order?<br />Unless NCK&#039;s account was hacked, but then they would have had a REAL mess on their hands and I am sure they would have let their customers know on their profile, to keep themselves from losing their entire rep!<br /><br />Anyone agree with this?<br /><br />- BTCpal

				It&#039;s really sad that newbies get taken advantage of, and it hurts not just them, but it hurts EVERYONE.<br />I also would like to mention that (being a BTC vendor) I personally talk to customers nearly every day that send their money numbers to some &quot;coin vendor&quot; and the &quot;vendor&quot; turns out to be a thief and just takes the money off the card and sends them nothing.<br />please ONLY do transactions when there is an actual ORDER, and if you are dealing with buying coins over SR, please place the order, then to be a little safer, ask the vendor to FINALIZE the order BEFORE you send them your moneypak number.<br />This will at the very least, guarantee you feedback rights.<br />If they refuse, cancel the order yourself and try another one.<br />Also, make sure there are TONS of positive feedback and a LONG history on SR.<br />References wouldn&#039;t hurt, either.....

				<br />So did you get all your money refunded?<br /><br />It is hard to be a noobie on SR. Vendors, especially well established ones, tend to put noob&#039;s on the bottom of their to do list and take care of their regular customers first. I cannot really blame them for it. But it is what it is.<br /><br />Try another vendor and maybe you will have better luck. After a few transactions I feel things will be easier for you.

				Ummm, I don&#039;t mean to doubt you, but based on your story, it sounds like the following could have happned:<br />Some one hacked/phished your SR info.<br />Waited until you had an order<br />While you weren&#039;t looking, logged into your account, canceled order, messaged them, and asked for BTC to be refunded to address they own.<br />You log in: &quot;WTF is going on here? Where is my weed or bitcoins?&quot;<br /><br />Could this have possibly happened? I&#039;d like to think that a big, well reputed vendor wouldn&#039;t fuck someone.... but it does happen.

				I&#039;ve ordered from NorCalKing, and not had any issues. The pot was some of the best I&#039;ve ever smoked (Blue Dream strain), and my order arrived in two days. I&#039;m sorry to hear you had problems with them.

				if you search the forums this subject has come up before and i looks like what happened is th OP logged on the a phisihn site, got his account hijacked and lost his BTC- it sucks but it can happen if youre not careful- also it appears OP is not savy enough to know what happened and why and now is blaming NCK- who really did nothing wrong- so&nbsp; the take away is 1) memorize the SR URL - its not hard and 2) use common sense to protect yourself and 3) when you fuck up (everybody does it ) learn and move on - but dont try to blame others for your mistake- because this prevents you from learning<br />i feel bad for the guy/girl, but trying to ruin a legit vendor&#039;s rep in not the way to go.<br />just my opinion

				This sounds odd. If your order was processing, the BTC were still held in escrow. If NorcalKing had cancelled your order the bitcoins would have returned to your account,&nbsp; there would be no option to transfer to a 3rd party as Norcalking never had the coins in their account.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only if the order was marked &quot;in transit&quot; (by vendor)and finalized (from your account) could the coins have been in NCKs possession, and transferred to 3rd party. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So something doesn&#039;t make sense here?&nbsp; I guess phishing is possible, but even then, the phisher would have had to finalize your order, then persuade NCK to refund an order to a new address (seems unlikely)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If NCK were scamming you, he would ask you to FE (finalize early, as in before pot was sent) and then not send anything. He would answer you messages politely saying &#039;its on its way&#039; to spin you out as long as possible before you gave him bad feedback. That&#039;s how selective scammers target newbies, not by cancelling the order, or claiming to.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To repeat, if NCK cancelled your order while it was processing, the coins would never be in his account, they would automatically return to yours.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I don&#039;t know what happened here. Perhaps I&#039;m misunderstanding your description of what happened.

I will give you a new address to send it to in 2-3 days. Please tell me if you have already sent it to the address I gave you.<br />This is the order: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account/view_transaction/632f6aa6a5<br />Sorry for the hassle bro, I fucked up&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 days&nbsp; &nbsp; read<br />delete<br /><br />So we replied back that he caught us just in time we would wait.&nbsp; We put it on our &quot;pending&quot; shelf &amp; forgot about it.<br /><br />Wed the 5th we receive a pm from the forums from him but written as if he thought he was contacting SR Customer Service!<br /><br /><br />I sent an order to them on Friday, May 31st and paid for priority shipping.&nbsp; I expected the order to go out that day, or at least by 11 am the next day as they advertise.&nbsp; That was six days ago.&nbsp; when I checked the status of my order it says &quot;processing.&quot;&nbsp; I think the only thing that is being &quot;processed&quot; is my bitcoin I sent them.&nbsp; I have tried several times to get in touch with them, and no answer.&nbsp; Also, I can&#039;t log on to silkroad now my original name and password info, and have to open a new account with a new name and password to gain access.&nbsp; This is fast looking like a scam to me.<br /><br />Before I go postal and start spreading the word on the internet about them AND silkroad I thought I would&nbsp; try this.&nbsp; &nbsp;SEND MY ORDER OR REFUND MY BITCOIN<br /><br /><br />We responded back to him after looking in the log book which showed that order was processed on Mon, (not recognizing his username) (we get between orders &amp; messages 300 - 400 usernames per week, so can&#039;t remember everything)&nbsp; so we let him know that his order didn&#039;t go out until Mon, so hold onto his pants!<br /><br />Then he pm&#039;s us again on the forum;<br /><br /><br />All you had to do was respond to my emails.&nbsp; To charge what you do for priority shipping, then wait until Monday to ship my order without notifying me is poor customer follow-up.&nbsp; You could have sent it first class for a hell of a lot less.<br /><br />But I am glad you did ship my stuff and no hard feelings.&nbsp; If it&#039;s good I will order on a regular basis from you.&nbsp; Understand this is my first time doing this and ripoffs do occur.<br /><br /><br /><br />To which we responded that we have not yet received any communication this week from him, maybe he sent it to our backup Tormail email address which had been down, &amp; that&#039;s where he had sent it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Send my order or refund my money.&nbsp; This is my second email to you. I<br />placed the order last Friday and paid you for priority shipping.<br />This is feeling like a scam and if it is you won&#039;t get away with it. I<br />will make sure everyone on the internet hears about you.&nbsp; If its not a<br />scam you really need to beef up your customer service.<br /><br /><br />So we decided to cancel his order &amp; let him figure out that he was the one who screwed everything up later.<br /><br />Then later Wed afternoon, we looked at the pending order on the shelf &amp; realized it was his order that had been asked for us to hold until he got us a new address. <br /><br />We tried to let him know that it might not be coming now that we realized the rest of the story &amp; we had been holding it waiting for a new address.&nbsp; He responded with a few more unkind messages &amp; told us to send it with tracking or he would send a message to every SR member that we were scammers.<br /><br />This was his last pm to us from the forum;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;tcbagby<br /><br />&nbsp;

&nbsp;Until you do I will continue spreading the word about your scam service on the SR Forum.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We finally think we know how it got him all confused . . .&nbsp; &nbsp;He is a n00b &amp; an old Viet Nam vet that may be missing or is on other medication which would clear up some of the reasons he doesn&#039;t get what&#039;s going on. <br /><br />We believe he registered and got the order in, but then forgot the url, &amp; when he searched to find SR again he ended up on a phishing link which there are still 1 or 2.&nbsp; Since he couldn&#039;t get in he couldn&#039;t message us &amp; eventually pmed us on the forums.&nbsp; Meanwhile whoever phished him logged in to his account &amp; saw the fresh order, messaged us to hold off until we were sent a new address.&nbsp; His messages have not been read since Mon morning when we responded back to him &amp; we sent a couple others . . . none have been read. <br /><br />We don&#039;t think he even knows what being fished is all about &amp; may have forgotten how he got on to SR to begin with.<br /><br />So he hasn&#039;t been on his account to see that there is no order, &amp; his coin would be back in his account which he adamantly deny&#039;s getting his money back.<br /><br />We sent him another message to log back into his account &amp; then he could read the message that was sent to us from his account on Mon asking us to hold the order, &amp; then see that there is no longer an order &amp; he has his bitcoin in his account, but we&#039;re not holding our breath, he believes we were trying to screw him, so he&#039;s out to get us come hell or high water!<br /><br />So since he intends to spread his &quot;cheer&quot;

				Folks really seem to go for the dramatic thread title round here too - accusatory doom and gloom rather than questioning. <br /><br />Out of interest, if you do click on an Atlantis phishing link and fill in your info, is that only a problem if you&#039;ve decided to use the same log-in info that you use on SR? Is it reliant on you giving them the info, or do they have malevolent ways of taking it from you unawares if you enter the phishy site?&nbsp;

Judging by the reasonably frequent stories of hacked accounts, there must be a fairly high success rate for the phishing sites - very easy to get the wrong link when not familiar, but reusing passwords... never good.

				This story is not making the slightest bit of sense, if he had ripped you he would of told you to FE and then never sent the goods. That is the only logical way you can rip someone that i can think of.

				I have placed two orders with Norcalking and both orders went through very smoothly, I received more than I paid for and both orders arrived within 4 days, packaging was great.&nbsp; I did send a message up front prior to ordering to introduce myself per their recommendation.&nbsp; My note was not answered but I assume they were busy working.&nbsp; Another order was cancelled by another vendor and I got my money back.&nbsp; <br /><br />I read the various guides especially How To Order and being a Newb I am a little confused about how the process works especially with encryption but figure I will learn over time.<br /><br />All the reviews that I read regarding Norcalking were good so it looked like a safe bet, money is protected in escrow until I finalize the sale.&nbsp; I finalized right away both times and did it gladly.&nbsp; I am really grateful for the great convenience of SR and appreciate the hard work of professionals<br /><br />You might send them a note, encrypt if you can, let them know what happened on your end and give them another try, you may find, like myself, that Norcal is straight up, they are good citizens working hard to deliver a quality product.&nbsp; Makes them a grade A vendor in my eyes
