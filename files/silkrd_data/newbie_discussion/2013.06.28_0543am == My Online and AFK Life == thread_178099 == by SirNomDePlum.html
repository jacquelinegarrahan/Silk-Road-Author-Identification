				Since time began tyrants have taken aim at personal liberties. We are supposed to live under a form of government based on representation. If I don&#039;t have the right to kick in your door and kidnap you or take your property because you&#039;re smoking pot then how is it logically that I can give that right and give that power to my representatives?<br /><br />It has now gotten to the point where it is necessary for all concerned people to protect their identity when they are exercising their natural human rights and sometimes the need arises, for those of us who choose to fight the good fight, to protect our true identities all the time and every waking minute. For if we don&#039;t, we have learned that Big Brother is waiting, watching and lurking in the shadows and they want nothing more than to label you as a terrorist or some other crazy unjust label. <br /><br />I was watching a documentary the other day and there was this guy talking. They have to blur him on a documentary he made while speaking out (hide his identity) because he is a VA patient in the U.S. and because it&#039;s still federally illegal there for marijuana he has to protect his identity otherwise if he is positively identified he loses all his federal benefits that he earned with his own blood. You see, he was injured while serving in the marines and as a result have had to use medical marijuana as a means of pain medication and to be able to sleep and to function period because he&#039;s been left with no alternative from the people that are supposed to care for him and us.<br /><br />The war on drugs is a war on freedom. The war on drugs is a war against everyone because they use that as a foothold to gain access to your car, your home, to your business, to everything you do. All under the pretense of protecting society or yourself from illicit drug use. <br /><br />The war on drugs leads directly to other mandates being crammed down our collective gullets.<br /><br />We need a radical change in how government operates in the U.S. and in order for that to take place there needs to be a revolution and if there is going to be a revolution then there is always a need to protect the revolutionaries in one way by protecting their true identity.<br /><br />As stated by another ...<br /><br />&quot;Government and politics is something that we collectively should have transcended a long time ago, yet it still exists and it’s still part of the average individual’s life.<br /><br />We as individuals have continued to give our power away to people who we think know what is best for us and we’re always relinquishing our individual responsibility, our individual divinity to other people who they themselves don’t even know what is even good for them. And we continue to do this collectively.<br /><br />Most of it is because we are all indoctrinated from birth to uphold this sort of status quo of how things supposedly work on this planet. When you’re child you’re taught from your parents that government and politics is just part of our lives. It just has to be there because these people know what is best for us.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth, especially when you understand what our government really is. We should be understanding that if these are not natural systems we need to transcend them and try to find out a way for the individual and the collective to move forward pass these illusionary boundaries of politics and government, because that’s all they are. They’re illusionary boundaries that continue to suppress the individual, which is the suppression of the society.<br /><br />We can never step into an enlightened society if the individual continues to believe that they need to vote for a certain person, or they need to be part of a certain political party, or they need to uphold the current government. We’re never going to move forward, we’re going to continue to slip further into the devolution of the specie. The planet will move on, the human species will be gone, because we continue to uphold unnatural systems. We have to move pass them.<br /><br />To articulate this, the great British philosopher Alan Watts once said:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When it comes down to it, government is simply an abandonment of responsibility on the assumption that there are people other than us who really know how to manage things. But the government, run ostensibly for the good of the people, becomes a self-serving corporation. To keep things under control it proliferates laws of ever increasing complexity and unintelligibly, and hinders productive work while demanding so much accounting on paper that the record of what has been done becomes more important than what has actually been done.<br /><br />In the current anxiety concerning overpopulation, pollution, ecological imbalance, and the potential of disasters of nuclear fusion, it is only seldom recognized that governed nations have become self destroying institutions, paralyzed and bogged in their own complications, and suffocated beneath mountains of paper.&quot; - Reference: http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/unveiled-lifted/<br /><br />Innocent people are being targeted and their lives and public reputations ruined because of overzealous government actions. Reference: http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/naked-citizens/<br /><br />Thus the need for alternate identities for some of us who choose to fight the good fight.<br /><br />New Identity Success Stories (borrowed from a website which I am not affiliated with in any way whatsoever)<br /><br />Names and locations have been changed to protect personal privacy.<br /><br />Sam was a unemployed accountant who was sure that he had found on the job of his dreams. This job had everything. A rapidly growing company, a flexible work schedule which included two days a week at home and their offices were incredible. And to top it all off, the salary was double what he expected. He quickly snapped up the job.<br /><br />But after a few months on the job Sam began to notice some strange things going on. Limousines would come and go at odd hours. Well dressed men walked in and out carrying large briefcases. And there were problems with the books. When Sam asked about several large checks that appeared very irregular, he was told to mind his own business and get back to work. Other money problems surfaced. The President of the company had placed his entire family, including his small children, on the payroll at generous salaries yet none of them ever showed up at the office! Sam didn’t dare ask about them. Nor did he ever say anything about the second set of &quot;cooked&quot; books he knew the owner kept.<br /><br />Eventually Sam came to the conclusion that he was working for a mob-owned business and he wanted out! So, he calmly went out and found another job. When he presented his mob boss with the usual two week notice letter, the boss laughed out loud and flung the letter back at Sam saying “you don’t tell me when you quit, I tell you - now get back to work! ” Sam was sick with worry. But what could he do? (definitely not rat that&#039;s for sure!) A friend told Sam to get a new identity.<br /><br />After Sam got his new identity, Sam was able to create a new identity and move to another state during a holiday weekend where he started a new life without fear of his mob boss showing up. He now holds an honest (though somewhat lower paying) position with a respected firm.<br /><br />Another story about Emma ...<br /><br />Being born in rural Mississippi, Emma was no stranger to the Klu Klux Klan. Like most southern blacks, she steered clear of them and kept her mouth shut about anything she knew involving their activities. Until one hot July night. Around midnight three Klansmen showed up at her neighbor’s house. They had a young black boy staying with them, a nephew of the neighbor, and apparently the boy had said something disrespectful to a local white girl. They beat the poor boy into a coma from which he never emerged. Even though Emma was 62 years old, when no one else would, she decided that she had to take a stand.<br /><br />She invited a reporter from a local paper to pay her a visit during which she revealed everything she saw and heard that terrible night. When asked if she wasn’t scared to speak out she said no, she was too old and “too close to the Lord” to be afraid. She wisely attracted enough attention to herself so that the Klan had to leave her be. But they did manage to make her life a living hell. After several months of death threats, Emma knew she had to get out of town. But where could she go? All her friends and relatives were in right there in Mississippi.<br /><br />Emma was able to change her name and move to a small town in another state where she will live out her “golden years” without fear with her new identity.<br /><br />A story about John ...<br /><br />John felt that something was missing from his life. When a friend at work suggested he attend a free lecture on how to lead a happier life, he jumped at the chance. Everyone in the group seemed to enjoy John being there and was eager to make him feel at home. He eagerly joined their outfit but as the months passed it became clear that the group was more interested in John&#039;s money than his happiness. They began to lean on John to pledge larger and larger sums. Suddenly, one night they blatantly demanded that he sign a promissory note for $10,000! He stalled for time, excused himself to go to the bathroom and snuck out of the building as fast as he could! He hoped that would be the end of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these cults don’t give up quite so easily. They called John so many times that he had to have his phone number unlisted. Then they threatened to use what they knew about John to black mail him if he didn’t pay up. When he refused, all sorts of bad things began to happen. They sent a forged arrest report to his boss. The IRS notified him that he was being audited. He started receiving threatening phone calls late at night.<br /><br />With John&#039;s new identity, John was able to say good-bye to his cult for good. Not only that, he’s now an active member of an anti-cult recovery group that helps cult members escape from these money mad outfits.<br /><br />Peter&#039;s story ...<br /><br />Peter, a middle aged man with conservative political views is particularly fearful of what the government might do at some point in the future. He feels that the best way to protect his freedom and the freedom of his family against the rapid expansion of federal powers is to create a clean alternative identity. By stashing the new ID documents along with $15,000 in cash in a safety deposit box he&#039;ll always have a “fallback” identity he can activate at any time.<br /><br />Peter was able to obtain a full set of genuine ID documents including a new birth certificate, drivers license, two major credit cards and even a passport in an entirely new name. Now he can rest assured that whatever the government thinks of Peter, he can quickly and easily shed his old identity, adopt a new one and start an entirely new life free from government harassment.<br /><br />About Jim ...<br /><br />Jim had been married to Susan for three relatively happy years. And then it all went wrong. Susan began to hear voices where they were none. She also began to spend money like it was going out of style. Despite being a life-long teetotaler, Susan began to drink heavily. Jim spent a small fortune on psychiatrists and doctors but after three long and difficult years he finally gave up and filed for divorce. Susan wasn&#039;t quite so flexible.<br /><br />Susan began to stalk and harass Jim. She would drive by his house and shout and beep her horn at all hours. She would suddenly appear wherever Jim went. At the mall, in parking lots and once she actually sat right behind Jim and a date at a movie. After several months of court appearances, Jim managed to obtain a restraining order which had no effect whatever on Susan&#039;s behavior.<br /><br />When Jim packed up and moved to a city in another state he thought that would be the end of it, but it wasn&#039;t. It only took Susan six weeks to locate Jim once again. Then she picked right up where she left off, following and pestering Jim all over town.<br /><br />Jim bought a new identity and was able to move away under an entirely new identity. It&#039;s been two years now and Susan hasn&#039;t yet been able to find Jim. Jim now has his freedom and has been able to rebuild his life in peace.<br /><br />All those stories above illustrate that there is always a legit need for an alternate identity and it&#039;s not always &quot;criminals&quot; that need them. The government would have you believe that you are committing a crime by getting an alternate identity but I disagree especially in the instance where the person getting the alternate identity is doing so to protect his natural human rights and to help further the fight against an already corrupt and oppressive government. In war and revolution the rules change!<br /><br />Hell, even Benjamin Franklin had a fake name! <br /><br />On a personal note ... in my lifetime I have been labeled a &quot;criminal&quot; even though I don&#039;t believe that what I was doing was a crime. I have been targeted by State and Federal government for no good reason. I have been persecuted, jailed, beaten, harassed and chased all because of my beliefs and some of my actions (none of which ever hurt anyone). <br /><br />I have made the choice to live in the shadows, a perpetual traveler with no nation home, living off the grid and trying as best I can to protect my identity and my life while helping others and making a living to survive. I haven&#039;t heard anyone call me by my real name in a long time and if I did I&#039;m sure it would sound like a strange unrecognized noise. I have no friends and everyone that sees me in my day to day affairs (few though they might be) are looking at a ghost. <br /><br />I&#039;m constantly careful and am always on the lookout for those that might want to take away my freedoms and natural human rights. I think about every action I take before I take it not because I want to but because I have to.<br /><br />I stay constantly busy ... working from the shadows, using a variety of different NomDePlums ... trying to earn a meager living and trying to put some funds towards the good fight at the same time. <br /><br />In short, I&#039;ve seen it all. Nothing surprises me anymore. Recently I&#039;ve chosen to reach out online via Tor, PGP, etc. even though I am somewhat new to it. If I&#039;m living the way that I&#039;m living then Tor, PGP and more is a necessity for me so I have begun my education even though I have been generally aware of those things for many years it is not until just recently that I have begun using them every day and learning more and more advanced techniques. <br /><br />Why am I reaching out now? I&#039;m not really sure. Maybe it&#039;s to try and find others like me out there and learn together and to be a part of some sort of a community since it is impossible for me to be a part of a normal community ever again. Maybe it&#039;s to try to be human again. Maybe it&#039;s because I want to help others like me because I now have a good friend that can get genuine identification paperwork such as PP&#039;s good for travel, DL&#039;s with receipt issued from agency, BC&#039;s, SS cards and even security clearance letters used to get PP&#039;s. Maybe it&#039;s a combination of all those reasons and more.<br /><br />Whatever the reason is I know it&#039;s a good cause and I know that I&#039;m doing the right thing to help the right people. I&#039;ve always been raised around &quot;good people&quot; but have had to live in the shadows for so long that anyone I once knew is only a distant memory. Are there still &quot;good people&quot; out there left? People that don&#039;t rat? People that are careful and who value education? People that would do a life sentence instead of turning State&#039;s evidence? One can only hope. I&#039;m SirNomDePlum and I declare V.V.V.V.V. forever!<br /><br /><br />

I have been persecuted, jailed, beaten, harassed and chased all because of my beliefs and some of my actions (none of which ever hurt anyone). <br /><br />I have made the choice to live in the shadows, a perpetual traveler with no nation home, living off the grid and trying as best I can to protect my identity and my life while helping others and making a living to survive. I haven&#039;t heard anyone call me by my real name in a long time and if I did I&#039;m sure it would sound like a strange unrecognized noise. I have no friends and everyone that sees me in my day to day affairs (few though they might be) are looking at a ghost. <br /><br />I&#039;m constantly careful and am always on the lookout for those that might want to take away my freedoms and natural human rights. I think about every action I take before I take it not because I want to but because I have to.<br /><br />I stay constantly busy ... working from the shadows, using a variety of different NomDePlums ... trying to earn a meager living and trying to put some funds towards the good fight at the same time. <br /><br />In short, I&#039;ve seen it all. Nothing surprises me anymore. Recently I&#039;ve chosen to reach out online via Tor, PGP, etc. even though I am somewhat new to it. If I&#039;m living the way that I&#039;m living then Tor, PGP and more is a necessity for me so I have begun my education even though I have been generally aware of those things for many years it is not until just recently that I have begun using them every day and learning more and more advanced techniques. <br /><br />Why am I reaching out now? I&#039;m not really sure. Maybe it&#039;s to try and find others like me out there and learn together and to be a part of some sort of a community since it is impossible for me to be a part of a normal community ever again. Maybe it&#039;s to try to be human again. Maybe it&#039;s because I want to help others like me because I now have a good friend that can get genuine identification paperwork such as PP&#039;s good for travel, DL&#039;s with receipt issued from agency, BC&#039;s, SS cards and even security clearance letters used to get PP&#039;s. Maybe it&#039;s a combination of all those reasons and more.<br /><br />Whatever the reason is I know it&#039;s a good cause and I know that I&#039;m doing the right thing to help the right people. I&#039;ve always been raised around &quot;good people&quot; but have had to live in the shadows for so long that anyone I once knew is only a distant memory. Are there still &quot;good people&quot; out there left? People that don&#039;t rat? People that are careful and who value education? People that would do a life sentence instead of turning State&#039;s evidence? One can only hope. I&#039;m SirNomDePlum and I declare V.V.V.V.V. forever!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>any updates on this friend ?
