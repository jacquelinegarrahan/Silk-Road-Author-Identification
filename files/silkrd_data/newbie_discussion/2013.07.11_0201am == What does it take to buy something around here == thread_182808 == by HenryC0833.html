				There&#039;s all these rules for new members and first time buyers.&nbsp; Well reviewed vendors often refuse to sell to noobs at all, and pretty much everybody wants to FE.&nbsp; Which I don&#039;t get, I mean the money is there, out of my reach, for days on end.&nbsp; All they have to do is fill the fricken order. <br /><br />I did place an order with a newish vendor who has at least some reviews, sounds like he&#039;s trying to establish a presence here, but it sat in processing for days, no communication; I finally cancelled the order.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t so much I got pissed, I would easily give him another chance. I dunno, maybe he blew me off?&nbsp; Mainly it makes me nervous when people appear to have fallen off the face of the earth, in this business.<br /><br />I will say BlueViking responded promptly and kindly to an inquiry and I&#039;m taking that as an indication that he&#039;s noob friendly, gonna hit him up when some more BTC clear.&nbsp; <br /><br />But MDMA wise, any other kindergartners here have any success, without having to jump through too many hoops? Or experienced people with noob-friendly US vendors in mind?<br />

				It takes balls and some patience. Also remember, you never ever never need to FE. Don&#039;t do it. You will be disappointed most likely.

				You need bitcoins, patience, and you need to find a good vendor on the road that uses escrow with noobies, so you will feel more secure.

				kwikEmart - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6ac193aff6<br /><br />They only have the speed based tabs right now but usually carries regulars. Prefers using the escrow system, 100% feedback, no minimum stats required. All around good peeps.
