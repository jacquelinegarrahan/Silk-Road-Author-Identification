				Dude&#039;s account is two days old and he is undercutting everyone on his rates for MP to BTC. Wondering if anyone reputable has had experience with this guy. Smells fishy to me.

				I put in an order close to a day ago and I&#039;m still waiting on my coin. I&#039;ll make sure to update this thread and let everyone know what happens. I&#039;m going to check for it tomorrow morning. I was weary myself going with a new guy but we&#039;ll see what happens.

				I&#039;m starting to get slightly worried. I placed my order with him yesterday and seeing as there has been multiple feedback reporting he filled other orders within three hours (long after I placed mine), I checked the balance on the MoneyPak I gave him and it&#039;s now drained. I&#039;m crossing my fingers I simply fell through the cracks. I emailed him and I&#039;ll update as soon as I hear back.

				Same here I communicated back and forth the day before and placed an order yesterday afternoon and haven’t heard a word and have sent several messages. Now hoping it’s not what I’m thinking it is.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Has anyone else checked their MP to see if their $$$ are still on it? He has a lot of great reviews and I&#039;m not trying to damage the guys reputation by any means, but I am concerned because now there&#039;s two others who haven&#039;t received their coins and I know the $300 from my MP isn&#039;t on there anymore. If your $$$ are still on your MP&#039;s then I&#039;ll feel better and simply remove this post, because as I said, I&#039;m not looking to damage his rep, but I&#039;m feeling more uneasy now that I&#039;m aware of others.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m also not trying to damage the dude&#039;s reputation. I&#039;ll be the first to tout him if he gets thru to me. I put in an order last night that has yet to be filled... he communicated well beforehand but now he is not responding. The problem with 0.00 digital currency postings is that you can theoretically create unlimited feedback for yourself at zero cost... so I don&#039;t really care about the reviews I&#039;m seeing. They are too easily faked. There is so much demand for transfers that one could easily buy an account, scam a bunch of people and make a lot of money almost instantly. Just put up some fake feedback and respond to some messages and all the sudden everyone is sending you MP&#039;s. <br /><br />We really need some extra safeguards for moneychangers. I&#039;ve seen far too many come thru SR and scam the shit out of people. <br /><br />That being said, ruling is still out on ETC. Has anyone had a positive experience with him?

				I&#039;m coming up on 24hrs since sending MP and haven&#039;t heard a thing from this vendor. Right now I&#039;ll give him the benefit of doubt since BTC is going crazy on the exchange. But I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s a fucking scam and that will just piss me off. This site has and was built on trust and anyone scamming needs hanging. I&#039;m disappointed if they went that far for a couple of bucks. I saved for a month to go shopping for my self and this does hurt.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Indeed BTC is going crazy right now with the exchange rate. But if the dude&#039;s bio is right, it shouldn&#039;t matter.<br /><br />This is one of the problems with the noob system here. WHY HAS NO ONE BROUGHT UP ETC IN THE RUMORS FORUM? Seriously, someone with 50+ posts needs to go there ASAP and get the scoop. I&#039;ve yet to hear one positive story about the guy. Please keep updating with your experiences.

				Very good points about how easy it is to scam people. Perhaps he simply ran out of coins and is getting new ones. Perhaps I&#039;m being naive. Either way, it&#039;s been 24 hours for me.

				New review on ETC profile says: 3hrs old Ordered yesterday morning and received it today but took over 24 hours. ETC came through with the deal and threw an extra $24 worth. Took a little bit but hes a man of his word. Thanks.<br />We&#039;ll see if this is true or not someone is on here that&#039;s a couple of days out without coin. <br />Has anyone reported them yet???????

				Check my account this morning and there is still no coin. I also sent him a message that he hasn&#039;t responded to as well. I was getting some bad vibes from this so i tried to take my money back from the moneypak but the funds have already been accessed. Right now it doesn&#039;t look good and I&#039;m pissed. I&#039;ve seen this scam before and he&#039;ll time out the orders and cancel them so you cant leave feedback.<br /><br />I was looking forward to $300 in btc but its now looking like I&#039;m fucked. I saved up to do this stuff to I&#039;m not the most wealthy guy I just was trying to treat myself.<br /><br />Anyways hopefully good happens but I have my doubts. If we get screwed we all need to report him and get his account banned.

				FML. That&#039;s $1,000 gone between three of us. I&#039;m reporting him. They can&#039;t do anything to get our money back but they can at least close his account so nobody else can get scammed.

				I&#039;m going to go and report it out $250 not happy at all figures i haven&#039;t been here in a year and soon as i get back on and ready to go I get screwed. Need to shut them off now so they can&#039;t rack a big hit. Not really worth the trouble to scam a couple of bucks. I guess I&#039;ll head on down to the hood and get the goods LOL at least i can see whats coming there. I think my days of doing business on the road is over. It&#039;s too bad great idea here, but to many that are here just to pay their rent. Htis wouldn&#039;t happen if I could anomalously buy BTC here in the states but all the 3rd party&#039;s have shut down the cash deposits to coin. #rd party&#039;s now want you to link your bank account, I don&#039;t think so. Good luck guys maybe the ass will come clean Ha!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				This is way too easy. Dude can even stop you from leaving bad feedback? There needs to be more safeguards against these kinds of cronies. Seriously, if I can chuck up enough money to buy a seller account and make off with thousands in MP&#039;s before anyone notices, without getting bad feedback, who cares if I am banned? I&#039;ll just make another account and do it again. SR needs to look at this, especially the feedback thing, b/c a lot of people are getting ripped.

				This guy is a full fledged scammer. Everyone needs to report him immediately. I went against my better judgement on this one and paid $300 dollars for it. I really was hoping to shop with that. Well, I believe in Karma and this guy has some serious shit coming his way in the future and I take comfort in knowing that. <br /><br />Take it easy guys. I&#039;m going with user viscous86 next time. I was going to use him initially but hes been on a little break and is coming back soon.&nbsp;

				Someone with enough posts needs to post about this guy in the Rumor Mill. There&#039;s at least five of us here who&#039;ve been taken for almost $2,000 so far. If not, others are going to get ripped off. SR can&#039;t do anything about our money but they can try to save future victims.

				Well it seems like he got about 10 of us on this one not a very good payday but to a low life it&#039;s all that matters I guess. It hurt me for the little moneys I put up was all I had to spend right now and half of what I out I have to payback. Was hoping for a shopping trip that was going to pay for it self. Oh well live and learn I won&#039;t do that again now will I. I&#039;m glad we got him shut down before it went to far.
