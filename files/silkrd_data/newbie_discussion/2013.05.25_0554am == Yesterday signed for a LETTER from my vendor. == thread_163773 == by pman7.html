				I made two (2) orders&nbsp; a few weeks ago, the first came within 10 days, the 2nd took about twice as long. I checked the mail every day. (I only ordered two small quantities, not sure why they didnt ship together)&nbsp; &nbsp; I was sitting at home when I realized that the maillady was backing up my driveway. I started to get nervous, but I remember a post a while back in the general forum about a guy who passed on a shipment that he didnt expect to sign for, and got flamed by several people about how it was most likely the post offices fault. I put this together with the fact that it took twice as long to get here and figured that it was simply a postal mistake. I answered the door for the nice lady, and signed her card. she gave me the small padded envelope which looked kinda dirty/beat up and had the original stamps and whatnot on it. She gave me it, and the rest of my mail and I went inside, heart pumping and to my dread I feel that the end of the envelope is only half stuck, as if it had been opened. The stealth was SO SO at best. if they didnt open the item inside they might not have noticed but how worried should I be?

				That&#039;s certainly strange, it&#039;s possible your vendor was tracking it with delivery confirmation.&nbsp; Did you message the vendor to see if they added the required signature?

				I have always gotten replies from vendors quickly (within 2 hours) if there was ever an issue.&nbsp; I don&#039;t feel like the post office would have you sign for something they know if contraband in order to catch you, you could just say that you were signing for it but didn&#039;t know what it was, it wouldn&#039;t be normal for someone to refuse to sign for a package without a good reason, that would make you more suspicious and might give them reason to open up the package.

				Thats the way I see it too, it doesnt make sense that they would make this facade to get you to sign and use that as some kind of admission of guilt, doesnt make sense at all. Furthermore, your right refusing to sign for something is just out of the ordinary if you werent expecting anything you would sign for it out of curiosity.&nbsp;

				Exactly, not signing for something wouldn&#039;t instantly strike the postman as abnormal.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the specific postman doesn&#039;t care what&#039;s in the mail and it seems very circuitous to have the postman conduct evidence gathering.&nbsp; That fact that you weren&#039;t arrested by an out of sight policeman the minute you signed makes it seem like you are in the clear.

				Lol true shit. Also, If theres any question in my head I always make sure to have a clear understanding with the vendor you do not want to have to sign for your package. And the whole having to use your exact name and shit must only be true in certain areas. I have literally gotten regular mail with free samples in it where I put the name as, lksdfajdsbvijdn&nbsp; &nbsp;haha my grandfather thought It was some terrorist shit hahaha, funny funny

				Yeah, unless it looks like the package was resealed, which it doesn&#039;t sound like it was, then you&#039;re are most likely in the clear.

				actually the reason for using a correct name is becoz posties get to know who lives where and a letter to jhgscjhyaqsjhb IS going to stand out which ISN&#039;T what you want eh?

				Did you select a postage option when placing your order? Express or Registered Post is more expensive than regular post where I&#039;m from so it seems strange the vendor would send it to you via a postage option you didn&#039;t select and is more expensive.&nbsp; ??? ???

				Do you think using a fake name will save your ass if LE are on to you? Tell you a secret ... it won&#039;t. Using a fake name is good for one thing - having your package go missing or misdelivered. If you&#039;re ordering shit from a reputable vendor that practices legit stealth techniques then that&#039;s the best insurance.<br /><br />To OP doesn&#039;t sound like much. PO fucks up in so many ways.

				OP, it sounds like your product just got dropped somewhere in the post office. Dirty, late and a little damaged all sound like it got dropped, lost and found later.<br /><br />It&#039;s a little weird to sign for a letter but for all the postman knows it&#039;s important documents, could have your driver&#039;s licence/passport/anything like that in and it&#039;s normal. She probably delivers hundreds every week and doesn&#039;t think twice.<br /><br />You got what you ordered and everything seems fine aside from the wait. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.

I didn&#039;t mention using a fake name, you did so I responded to that. A lot of vendors even state on their profile not to use a fake name. Again there is a reason for that too.<br /><br />Where is it you live? In China? You must be ordering from some shit vendors if you&#039;re scared enough to use a fake name. <br /><br />&quot;Oh hey Mr.Police Officer ummm ya no that ounce of coke is not mine see that&#039;s not my name on it someone mailed it to me as a joke?&quot;<br /><br />Does that sound to you that it actually works? Tell yourself whatever you need to so you can sleep better at night but you&#039;re no more safer using a fake name. Do some research on so called &#039;plausible deniability&#039;. Better yet take each word and say them separately. Does it still sound like what you think it means. Go look up in the word and come back and tell me what it means and then maybe we can revisit the issue of whether to use a fake name or not.

				I was just saying, in my area(not huge population either) My postal carrier and people working at the post office(whom I know, and have talked to multiple times) do not care about names at my address, probably anyone elses in the area. Now somewhere like a densly populated area, I would assume they would scrutinize packages and names in the mail more heavily. Just everyone should learn what they need to know about their area, to each his own, and much luck be with you all
