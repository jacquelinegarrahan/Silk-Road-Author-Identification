				Probably nothing to worry about man, I get letters from the old property owners all the time. I would still get rid of any clear evidence in the house, dude just rember if you don&#039;t admit to anything then your fine, that&#039;s the good thing about SR! Take care bro

				Just wait a while longer.<br />In my experience, the name on the address makes no difference. <br />It may just be late - post is sometimes late.<br /><br />Don&#039;t burn down your house just yet. lol ;)

				what does it mean to say &quot;clean the comptuer&quot; i see people writing that a lot. it&#039;s like just a reformat? will reformatting take care of everything? <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t stress it man, unless it&#039;s a huge order

				Thanks guys. Not a huge order (a little ket and a few grams of coke ) but I am feeling ultra paranoid. Just doesn&#039;t seem likely the cops could come to my house with a warrant right off the bat right? Figure I cant order anything for a while though. Made an order a long time ago with my real name and that came through, so its ironic this time wouldnt work.

				There are multiple reasons why a shipment would be late or not arrive at all.<br />Using an old resident&#039;s name can be a problem, if the old resident has forwarded his mail he could receive it at his new address.<br />Keeping your house and your computer clean is always a good idea.<br />

				Goodluck, atleast keep house clean, and delete TOR browser etc- you can also store everything you use for deepweb and put it on a usb or something, also encrypting phone and hdd if you are extreme secure :)

Were you previously getting mail for this person at your place? If you were they probably don&#039;t have forwarding so the package is most likely late for another reason.<br /><br />In future though, it is bad practice to use an existing resident&#039;s name on your packages. Not only is there an increased chance of having the item intercepted by someone (post office, previous resident, etc) but you are also amplifying repercussions if the package is intercepted.
