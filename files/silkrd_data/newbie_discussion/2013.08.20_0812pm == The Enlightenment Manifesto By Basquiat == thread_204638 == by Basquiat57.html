				For thousands of years, human&#039;s have always been in pursuit of a mythical holy grail, the perfect state of being. Some say this pursuit started with the Buddha&#039;s now famous proclamation &quot;I am Enlightened&quot;, however a close study of our past suggests that enlightenment or at least the idea of enlightenment, has been around way before the Buddha ever set foot on earth. <br /><br />So what is enlightenment anyway? Enlightenment goes hand in hand with the notion of an absolute Truth. An undeniable experience of the Glory of Everything. The sudden realization of the Oneness.<br /><br />BUT <br />Could the idea of enlightenment just be the child of humanity&#039;s insecurity regarding reality? Could it be that enlightenment is just our way of dealing with a harsh reality? A lie orchestrated to keep us from being depressed by the bland reality that is life, sort of like how parents lie to children about Santa? <br /><br />I say yes, and no.<br /><br />Enlightenment means different things to different people. To a person who sees enlightenment as a sudden, magical experience where God&#039;s Absolute Truth shines on you, forever changing you to the perfect Man, then you could compare it to Santa or the Tooth Fairy. And sadly, I can bet my life&#039;s savings that none of us have or will ever see the white bearded man in red. However, some people view enlightenment quite differently. Some people see it as a slow development of knowledge, wisdom and acceptance. &quot;Ok, that seems more realistic right&quot; Still you may ask,&quot;knowledge, wisdom and acceptance of what exactly?&quot; <br />Life. <br /><br />Life is the type of thing that can&#039;t be given a straight and undebatable definition. Through living, we all learn and determine what life means to us. Naturally, our conclusions on what life means will differ. So if that&#039;s the case shouldn&#039;t the meaning of Enlightenment be the same? Precisely. That&#039;s the magic of it. I believe enlightenment doesn&#039;t have to be some supernatural change that happens like the strike of lightening from Thor&#039;s hammer (Lol). It is an everyday thing. Through living (learning), experience (wisdom) and acceptance of your own life, you become enlightened. It is about discovering YOUR Truth. To me that&#039;s magical, and it beats any myth about walking on water or glowing in the dark. <br /><br />I believe accepting this very fact is enlightenment on its own.<br /><br />Lol so life isn&#039;t so bland after all!<br />What are your views?<br /><br /><br />Basquiat
