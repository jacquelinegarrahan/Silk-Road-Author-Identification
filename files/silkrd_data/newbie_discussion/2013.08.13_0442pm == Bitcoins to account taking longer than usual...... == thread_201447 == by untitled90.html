				I sent BTC to my SR account more than 5 hours ago and they still are not showing. I was wondering if anyone else is having this issue? <br /><br />It may possibly have somthing to do with the unexpected downtime earlier, which now seems to be resolved....

				Yeh I think your all right, just a case of waiting I guess.<br /><br />Never taken this long but like I said, I reckon it has something to do with the recent downtime.<br /><br />But by god its frustrating! <br /><br />It will arrive tho.

				Still no joy buddy, surfing the support pages for anyone experiencing the same, but seems Im the only one. <br />The FAQ says it could take up to 6 hrs, now coming on 8, never taken this long in my time on the road! I still have faith, if all else fails ill contact support through SR.<br /><br /><br />I do indeed love the weed, and if this transaction fails I will try funding my account again tomorrow! <br /><br />Whats your vendor page buddy?<br /><br />my name on SR is the same as here =]<br /><br />

				My first time it took a few hours and I freaked the *** out.&nbsp; Sure did feel silly when they showed up.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry too much about it.&nbsp; Go outside and spend some time in the sun, then come back later and check.

				Hey untitled,<br /><br />well, glad to hear everything worked out fine for you finally! Although I didn&#039;t really expect something else.<br /><br />Glad to hear you love the weed as well. Unfortunately I still don&#039;t have a vendor account, that&#039;s why I am looking for prospective customers. The vendor fee is quite expensive for just a hobby grower. But that&#039;s the best weed you can get, as no commercial grower can put that much love into every single plant and respond to each individual plants demands as good as a passionate grower.<br /><br />Our weed is either grown under LED or natural sunlight in a greenhouse. Making it Indoor-Quality always, but enriched with UV-B light for extra broad spectrum of cannabinoids resulting in stunning celebrating high together with a smooth stone and advanced medical benefits of a very healthy stress-free grown plant. We take that care as we basically grow for our-self. But that kind of growing is more expensive and less economic than commercial growing. So we need to sell more, smoke less ;-) otherwise we go bankrupt.<br /><br />So we basically have very limited amounts, which means need to choose wise, where to sell and if to spend 4.8 BCs on vendor fee. Would do it if I have some pre-orders. I am gladly willing to send you a free sample, in order to gain you as a frequent loyal customer, as I am sure the weed will speak for it-self. And if there is a demand, we will set-up the vendor account.<br /><br />Nevertheless we are experienced in stealth packaging and so on as we are traveling a lot and have transferred weed for our own consumption already frequently.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: OpenPGP.js v.1.20130712<br />Comment: http://openpgpjs.org<br /><br />xo0EUgpNZAED/0gidUV6dh57iJoix4iHnzJ3+kkRN34DbR6M3sxid8bf+Sv+<br />u+qM68Lv9B+U0OdmJolie/hPn0eP+jjgejk/cU7ALthRaLKHscpLofub+lnn<br />sMnmXMjEhZvs+wTzSn8LqwmuKNpC7umahMOXO3CyOcOFrAc/0z5T9wrFzGL3<br />AxXrABEBAAHNPUdyYW5kbWEgPEJNLTJEQlNxUHYyY2dhNTY5WUJReGlONEdy<br />WU1uMUExTndrM01AYml0bWVzc2FnZS5jaD7CnAQQAQgAEAUCUgpNZQkQCeGx<br />sdlxR4sAAG9vA/wNmZexyXGTD/hH5yT65Um1VpBwabt+YNwIET0u9VFORZMT<br />WuAVjnraF/ueOMnt7sDdpKdqHlCAi+ebcVPnpJiOcYpiZdGLMmVFBw24/8k2<br />Vdu68IbfPFGRmNw2j/Z8+oSSuhyItvJ4WiUSVKWpnzPTEkk/kmZbIsuB+EUH<br />NLc7WQ==<br />=vl3I<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />
