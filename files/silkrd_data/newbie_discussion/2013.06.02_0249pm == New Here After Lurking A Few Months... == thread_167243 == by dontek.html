				Been lurking on SR for the last few months and I guess educating myself on safe practices, watching vendor reviews, quality reviews, etc. <br />Finally decided to give it a roll today. Just ordered 1/4oz of Purple Haze from XXOtica. Anxious and nervous at the same time. Have a safety plan in place in the instance it shows up smelling like a CD. <br />Was going to post in their thread as well, but don&#039;t have that option. I realize NEWBS can only post here, but was looking for a Rules/Regulations for the forums but can&#039;t find them anywhere. Certain post count to access the rest of the forum? <br />Anyways, like I said, will be interesting to see how this goes and this may be my new source of supply. Where I live, you either get reg weed or kill shit, and kill shit runs $110/$120 qtr easily, so with my order I am saving about $55, and in these times, $55 is a decent amount. <br /><br />Okay...I&#039;ll be back hopefully with an update that everything went smooth and flawless!

The captcha will disappear after 100 posts and you will also gain the ability to award karma to others at that time.<br /><br />The only forum &#039;rules&#039; per se are no child pornography, no attempting to sell on the forums (you need a vendor account to sell on Silk Road) and no releasing personal information of any member / looking for local hookups.<br /><br />Other than that, feel free to discuss anything you please. :) One other thing I would say is please read the SR Wiki - it contains a huge amount of information that you will need to know in order to keep yourself (and your money!) safe:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks Libertas! Figured there was a minimum post count, good to know the number now. Gonna browse around and join some conversations and sure that 50 will go by quickly.
