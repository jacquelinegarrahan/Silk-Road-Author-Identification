I mean i apologies but come on please some basic logic goes a long way..<br /><br />its not only dangerous and unsafe for that package but also for all future packages, customs profile the vendors package and country of origin and thats it for that vendor to ship! hes profiled!!!<br /><br />so please STOP informing customs of country of destination...

				Agreed.&nbsp; I would expand it to: In feedback do not specify the destination or the source location, do not describe the packaging, and generally speaking not reveal anything specific enough to be useful to LE.<br /><br />&quot;Excellent product, fast shipping, would use again&quot; = OK<br /><br />&quot;Product was good, stealth was great got here to NZ no problem! They put a DVD case in a green envelope that had a pink address label and some glitter on the outside, and shipped from NYC&quot; = NOT OK

				SHOCK HORROR!!!!! <br />Australian Customs alerted to drugs being sent through the mail. Get real. Some of you people get a little precious.<br /><br />I for one would find feedback relating to shipping times and successful destinations helpful in making a purchasing decision.

				OP do you have any evidence that this makes any difference? I read on a their website Aus customs seize over 750 kg of drugs a year, nearlyr 2kg a day and considering most orders below 10g more than 200 packages a day. I can&#039;t see customs workers saying &quot; hey guys keep a special lookout this month cos dave on SR order 2gm of coke from Germany on the 8th&quot;

				While it is always good practice to say as little as possible, I am sure Aus. customs knows that drugs are getting mailed to their country, but lucky for you there are hundreds of thousands of legitimate mail pieces coming at the same time so it is still like trying to find a needle in the haystack.&nbsp; Sometimes they get lucky, but just like the lottery most times you do not get picked.&nbsp; but yes, a little common sense goes a long way when you play our game.&nbsp; Without it you will not be playing long.
