				&nbsp; Lately I&#039;ve been running into wannabe motherfuckers with the work ethic of a welfare addict.&nbsp; This seems to be an ongoing thing in my current area as my profits have been slashed 50% this year.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard everything from &quot;It&#039;s the economy&quot; to &quot;Noones buying dude&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Both of those excuses are retarded and hold no water.&nbsp; Sex, drugs, and rock n&#039; roll always thrive no matter what state the economy is in.<br /><br />&nbsp; I recently had a meeting with my 3 middle men about expanding both the territory and line of drugs I offer and asked their opinions.&nbsp; All 3 said it was a bad idea because the economy was so bad that noone had money for drugs.&nbsp; HUH!?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; I fired all three of their lazy asses right then and there.&nbsp; I&#039;m so sick and tired of dreamsellers and wannabes.&nbsp; I know I&#039;m no &quot;American Gangster&quot;....but scared money don&#039;t make money and everyone seems overly scared.&nbsp; Besides, I could be a few levels higher than where I currently am, and want to be, but can&#039;t seem to get anyone I know to help make this happen.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;9-5 jobs are for suckers and college is for stupid suckers who want an assload of debt to go along with that useless degree from their community college.&nbsp; In this day and age, there isn&#039;t a person alive that isn&#039;t doing something nefarious on the side for a bit of extra cash.&nbsp; Welfare fraud, insurance fraud, stealing from the register, etc.&nbsp; I just wish I could find someone hungry who isn&#039;t scared of the police and prison.&nbsp; Buncha baby wannabe gangstas around that think selling a measly QP of pot means they&#039;re big time...it makes me wanna break their fucking jaws.<br /><br />&nbsp; Where the fuck are all the &quot;American Gangsters&quot;&nbsp; who snub their noses at the law and make bank??&nbsp; I&#039;m beginning to think we are becoming an extinct species being pushed out by useless idiots....so sad.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for letting me rant, and kudos to all of you on SR doing your thing....much respect.

Not sure if you ever watched the movie BLOW w/ Johnny Depp. There was a scene where Boston George was sitting in jail when Diego turned to him and asked, &quot;Do you know why you&#039;re sitting in here?.&quot; Then he basically said that George HAD THE WRONG VISION. At this day in age, its hard to find a crew of people with the same vision as you. <br /><br />-Judge

				&nbsp; Yeah, I&#039;m a big fan of &quot;Blow&quot; and &quot;American Gangster&quot;.&nbsp; Those folks knew what the deal was and took a chance....after all, scared money don&#039;t make money.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t seem to convince my &quot;guys&quot; that it doesn&#039;t matter if you get caught with an ounce or 10 pounds....the charge is exactly the same for what I&#039;m offering.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Perhaps a move to the border states will offer more opportunities as I tire of this nickle and dime crap.
