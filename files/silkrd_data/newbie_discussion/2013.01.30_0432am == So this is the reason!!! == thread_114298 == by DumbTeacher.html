				So this is the reason that I can no longer ask the questions that I need answers to. In my humble opinion, this is quite... interesting. I have already spent over $2500 on The Road but in order to get a question answered, or to even speak to anyone in the know, which I was able to do about two weeks ago, I have to post here an additional 41 times, huh??? Okay, here we go.

				Same boat, dumb teacher. However for people with buyer stats already, I figure this is a formality. It may be a set up for newbies, since a vendor can&#039;t read your posts to see what you&#039;ve been doing on the forums if you&#039;ve been posting shit.

				I think the 50 posts idea is retarded because some of the best things on this board have come from people who have come on here to post only a couple of times (Like the Australia post worker who is stickied in the main section).<br /><br />Doing this discourages some of this amazing information being shared. Personally I have not spammed to get 50 posts but it&#039;s pretty shit knowing i&#039;ll probably have to wait a couple of weeks to get to 50 posts.

				Morning. Yeah, I got tired of spamming and so posted random quotes (perhaps that&#039;s still spamming, but at least it felt a little more useful to the world). The thread still got deleted and I fell back below 50. Oh well
