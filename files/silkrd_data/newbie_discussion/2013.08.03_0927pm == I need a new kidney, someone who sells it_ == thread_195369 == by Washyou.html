				Are you sure cirrus?<br />I remember a person speaking about that over a year ago and DPR said no. Because when you allow organ selling than that encourages people to kill others and sell there organs or other such terrible things. Same reason that hit man services are not allowed.

				So then why is there no organ section on the road?<br />Honestly there are a lot of people out there who wish they could sell there extra kidney for profit. A lot of people need money for whatever purpose yet have no connection to be able to sell an organ.<br />I currently am lacking in funds and would love to be able to sell my O- kidney via escrow. <br /><br />That guy who said 1500$ was either joking or retarded. A perfect condition O- kidney like mine in the United States will fetch 300,000$ any day minus doctor fee&#039;s/ transportation fee&#039;s. <br /><br />On the same token my kidney would only get me about 100,000$ in the Middle East and as low as 15,000 in Asia.

				There is a small time period from when the organ is taken out to when it needs to go back in a body. Otherwise it will go bad. Certain body parts can last on ice, but not a kidney.<br />And the idea is for people to sell there own kidneys. I can&#039;t imagine the road would support the idea of killing people and harvesting them. <br />

I&#039;d just need actual verification and maybe some upfront good faith money to setup a sterile environment and find a donor.

				while i agree with the philosophy of its my body and i can sell it if i want,i think the ban is largely to stop people from dening the relatives wish to be an organ donor, then try to sell them piecemeal to highest bidders. also it would freeze the poor and middle class out of getting need donor organs? or am i being dumb? i&#039;m probably being dumb.

				Also one of the ways is you pay said person for there organ. They go to the hospital say they would like to donate it to that person, then transaction complete and escrow is released.<br />As long as the hospital believes you are selflessly donating your organ for no gain you should be fine.

I think it would be a cool, social media like setting where you can look at people&#039;s profiles and pick out a kidney. <br /><br />You meet up, give the other party a &quot;donation&quot; and get your organ.

				I&#039;ll sell you half my kidney at half price. If you find someone else who will sell half with same blood type you can sew the kidneys together and insert into body. <br /><br />But seriously if you buy a kidney how you expect on surgically implantin&#039; it into your body? Seems like the best place to get a kidney is at a hospital who does implant operations with donated organs. Safest place.
