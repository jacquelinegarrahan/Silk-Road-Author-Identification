				As trying to get 50 HQ posts, I have always wondered on what others think about this particular topic. The facts the media attempts to bash drugs and what they do to people, it is asked whether its what people do to themselves because of their personality.<br /><br />For me, I feel like I am addicted to money. I love it, all I think about is how rich I want to be when I am older, and always think of different ways of making money. I went from selling Runescape gold, to selling fake Beats and now to selling pills to a few close friends, which I plan on starting to sell to a bigger audience once I finish my exams. <br /><br />In the drug sense, I don&#039;t feel addicted, I get the odd craving if I am listening to some House music wishing I was in a rave or something, but other than that, I enjoy going out and drinking most of the time. I know there are a lot of people that have the so called &#039;addictive personality&#039; where if they try something, they like it a lot and they get hooked onto it, whether it be steroids, gambling, drinking and doing drugs.<br /><br />There has been a lot of controversy that is asked whether it is in fact the drugs that destroy lives, mentally and physically, or the person themselves, who are unable to control their addiction.<br /><br />What do you guys think of this?

				No doubt there are addictive personalities.&nbsp; But, I believe addictive treatments and rehab methodologies are in their infancy, as is mental health care.&nbsp; (Really, as late as 1970, we were still lobotomizing patients).&nbsp; I believe people can be TAUGHT to handle drugs through education (such as this board, or drugs-forum.com).&nbsp; Addiction, and physical dependence can be two different matters.&nbsp; With addiction, you&#039;ve basically given up, and require someone to help you wean off or control your doses.&nbsp; However, you can wean off anything that you become physically dependent upon if you understand that you&#039;re simply physically dependent, rather than addicted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Addicted is the dark, sexy media term.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have to be that way.&nbsp; You can make choices.&nbsp; To answer your question, people destroy their own lives.&nbsp; Sometimes by not respecting the power of the drug.&nbsp;

The Dutch has a very relaxed view on drugs, and what they see as hard drugs and soft drugs in comparison to the USA are very different, and from what I have seen has proved successful. <br /><br />No doubt addiction occurs, but I believe it&#039;s the personality of the person, which may be genetic or brought up with which causes the addiction of carry on, which leads to situations that none of us every wish to experience.

				Drugs do not destroy people&#039;s lives; people destroy their own lives. I believe there are accidents where someone overdoses or maybe has a really bad trip and winds up naked in public, freaking out, but those are anomalies. That doesn&#039;t seem any more likely to me than the odds of being in a house fire or getting randomly assaulted by someone.<br /><br />For the most part, people do use drugs and they end up perfectly fine. If drugs were ruining people&#039;s lives then they wouldn&#039;t be leaving such a large group of people more or less untouched. Most of what you hear is government hype. I have heard all about the dangers of ecstasy and how you&#039;ll &#039;overheat and die&#039;. It&#039;s a myth, or at least a gross exaggeration. I have taken ecstasy dozens of times and beyond some jaw clenching and feeling a bit of a &#039;hangover&#039; after, I haven&#039;t had ill effects.<br /><br />Yes, there are some people who cannot control themselves with drugs. There are also people who cannot control themselves with alcohol, food, and hoarding.

				IMHO drugs don&#039;t destroy lives, people do it themselves.<br /><br />1. Very often people try to use drugs to escape from problems. That never works out (for more than a few hours at best), no matter what drug it is!<br />Drugs aren&#039;t supposed to solve problems. If anything, they&#039;re supposed to give deep insights, turn you from okay to happy or from happy to superhappy (FOR A WHILE), relieve physical pain, relax, enhance pleasures etc. But they will never ever fix your life for you while you lay down on the couch or dance like a maniac. <br /><br /><br />2. A lot of people who &quot;got in trouble&quot; and consumed drugs at the same time, would have gotten in trouble anyways.<br />I mean, if I loose my job because I suck at it, and then my girlfriend because I yelled at her for no good reason all the time, and then became depressed, why on earth would I blame all that on drugs? My life would be the same whether I also took drugs or not. Of course there are cases where a drug was the root cause of all that. But often it is not.<br /><br />Sometimes these people then blame drugs because its an easy scapegoat that everyone will accept without digging deeper. For some its just better than admitting its their own fault. &quot;See, dad, I really did my best! But those stupid drugs messed everything up! I didn&#039;t have a chance! If it wasn&#039;t for those bad bad drugs, I&#039;d be a millionaire dating a supermodel right now. Seriously!&quot;<br />I think many people are afraid to take responsibility for their own life. So they claim that &quot;other forces&quot; &quot;made&quot; them do things. Like &quot;I just followed orders&quot;, &quot;my religion forced me to do that&quot;, &quot;Sorry I&#039;m crazy. You can&#039;t blame me for killing 26 people. It were the voices in my head!&quot;, &quot;violent games and movies inspired me&quot;, &quot;I was soooo drunk! Can&#039;t blame me!&quot;, &quot;I&#039;d love to, but society frowns upon it&quot;. People always want to be able to point a finger and say &quot;it wasn&#039;t my fault, i had no control over it&quot;.<br /><br /><br />3. The idiots among drug users often forget that you CAN take drugs, but that you also have to be very careful and you have to take responsibility over you usage. They mix drugs that shouldn&#039;t be mixed. They take too much, because more is better, right? They lack any respect for the drug they are taking. And they forget one of the golden rules of drugtaking: always be stronger than the drug! You need to control the DRUG. Don&#039;t let the drug control YOU (exception: &quot;In soviet russia, drug control YOU!&quot;&nbsp; *SCNR*).<br />There aren&#039;t many people who are stronger than e.g. crack or heroin in the long run. So to me, they are taboo.<br />They also forget another rule: know your drug! &quot;Hey, what&#039;s that? Never heard of it. Let&#039;s just take a handful of it, and mix it with 12 other substances. Paaaartheeeeyyyy!11!1&quot;<br /><br /><br />4. They take the wrong kind of drugs. No high or trip can be awesome enough, to sacrifice my teeth, my organs, my skin, my brain etc. If you take shit, you turn into shit. Easy as that. Your fault, not the drugs fault! Be more careful and selective about what you take. If you encounter a drug that does nothing @1mg, is awesome @1,1mg and kills you for sure @1,2mg than don&#039;t fucking take it you dumbass! Have an unprecise scale? -&gt; bam, you&#039;re dead! Was it worth it? Was it cool? Well, it definitely was the drugs fault, right? See 2. <br /><br /><br />Hmmm, seems this turned into a rant. I&#039;ll stop now.<br /><br />To sum it all up: If drugs destroyed your life, you were doing it wrong!<br /><br />If you knowingly run a car into a brick wall at full speed, it&#039;s not the cars fault. You&#039;re just too dumb to live.<br />Just like a lot of people are so dumb that they shouldn&#039;t be allowed to vote, or to raise kids, or to drive a car, there are many people who are indeed too dumb to take drugs.<br /><br />PS: Whey I wrote &quot;you&quot;, of course I didn&#039;t mean the thread opener. I&#039;m talking to the world.

				It depends on the drug and on the person. The mistake is to put all drugs under a single label and declare it bad, which is what the media does. Or alternatively, to put them into a small number (e.g. 3) bands, if these bands are seemingly arbitrary. For example LSD and MDMA being in the worst one, even though they are amongst the safest.<br /><br />The truth is you will get people who can take these drugs recreationally without problems. Maybe they hold down jobs too. You will also get people who wreck their lives by overdoing it. You can say the same for alcohol, and for food. So it&#039;s all just political gesturing rather than based on what&#039;s best for the safety of people. It gets you votes to be against drugs, even if that means ignoring the advice of scientists who study these drugs for a living.
