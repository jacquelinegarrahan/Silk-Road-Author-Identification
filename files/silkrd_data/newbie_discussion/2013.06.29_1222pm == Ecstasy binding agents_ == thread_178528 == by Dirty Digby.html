				Ecstasy whatever may be within a different pill, I consider true ecstasy to be pill form MDMA.<br /><br />So my question, a pill is going to weigh around 300mg each approx? An (average) pill will have around 100mg MDMA and the remainder of the pill should be an inert binding agent to keep the thing from falling apart and I guess some other binding agent colored to make it look pretty.<br /><br />Minus the MDMA content and assuming the pill is not adulterated or full of any shit, what would be the remaining contents of the pill and what ratio would they be. Are these binders basically harmless or do they have side effects themselves that we should be aware of? <br /><br />Im really just curious about the typical quality pill not extreme examples of people mixing in other chems or what not. Just the non active binders and coloring agents that are basically 2/3rds of the pill itself.<br /><br />I can google any vague answers I get. Thanks in advance.

				generic internet answer : <br /><br />mdma is first powdered, than mixed with a binder such as china clay, paper binding, sucrose or lactose, depending on how much mdma is added to the binder depends how strong the pill is, other ingredients can be used to take more space, such as caffeine, amphetamine, ghb, or other space takers, the mixture is then put in a pill press which pressurizes the powder into a pill, stamps are also used to give the ecstasy pill it&#039;s cool logos, color is added to give it it&#039;s color or it is sometimes natural color from other ingredients added, or binders being used.<br /><br />teal&#039;s answer : <br /><br />in my experience, the non-psychoactive additives to an advertised pill of ecstasy have usually been: sucrose/lactose (it&#039;s cheap) and some iteration of food coloring such as FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6. sadly because most of the ecstasy found in my state is manufactured in Mexico, its safe to assume the manufacturer is using a modern version of Amaranth (FD&amp;C Red No. 2) or some other dye that&#039;s been deemed unsafe by the FDA. <br /><br />i hope that illuminates things a little
