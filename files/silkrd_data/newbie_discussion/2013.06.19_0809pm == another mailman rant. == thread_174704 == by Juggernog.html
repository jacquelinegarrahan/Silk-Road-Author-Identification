				I gotta say; my carrier is awesome.&nbsp; I get all the town&#039;s gossip from he/she!&nbsp; I actually don&#039;t send packages to any addresses on his/her route as I wouldn&#039;t ever want them to feel like they were in the middle of something illegal if I got caught.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let that be some other carrier I don&#039;t know!

				<br />6 fucking PM and they stuff so much bulk mail(wasted trees) in our box&#039;s that everyone in my place has lost multiple bills because they stuff the junk, oh I&#039;m sorry bulk mail in first. <br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve worked for them. lasiest bunch of union fags you&#039;ll ever want to meet for the most part. The routes take less than 4 hours and my first day did my route in 3.5 and got screemed at, pulled aside and lectured that if I did that they would expect all of them to, or wonder why and how a first timer could do a better job in half the time.&nbsp; Unions, affermitve action for the dumb and lazy. Not you grandpa, he was a letter carrier( OC title I think) &amp; most days was piss drunk by the time he ended his route and I&#039;m pretty sure he was getting some ass along the way. atta boy Grandpa. RIP<br /><br />there&#039;s a few good ones.

				back when the online florida Dr consultations were kicking butt my Fed-ex guy would stop by and say here&#039;s you drugs... I almost shit myself as there were tons of pills. then he started dropping off samples of his wares and all was good in the world. They even expressed them general delivery to a tiny Alaskan vilage on the Bering sea with 1 little store and a combo PO, library community center when I ran out while I was up there working.&nbsp; &nbsp; 20 cents for 2mg xanax bars 17 cents for compound 15mg oxycodone with only 80 mg or tylonal.&nbsp; more than once they sent my order 3 days in a row!!!&nbsp; with idiots selling vicodins on here(sorry idiots buying vicodin&#039;s here for 8.99) those were the good ole days.&nbsp; &nbsp;They seem to be making a comeback after vanishing.
