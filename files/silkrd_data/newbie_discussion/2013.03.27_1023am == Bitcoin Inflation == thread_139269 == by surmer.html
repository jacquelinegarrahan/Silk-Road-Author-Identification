				So, I&#039;ve read a few times before about price adjustments on the Road. Bitcoin is racing ever higher on MtGox. Seriously, the prices on the Road are not accounting for the &quot;inflation&quot;. Prices that were $60US are now $80-$90US for the same product.<br /><br />Also: is it just me, or is English the only language on the Road &amp; Forums?

				I&#039;ve read on the forum that the price of the goods are pegged to the US dollar but I&#039;ve not seen any hard evidence that there is such a link.<br /><br />What I have seen though is the price of products in bitcoins come down to reflect the new rates. To me it looks like the vendor&#039;s are responsible for manually updating their prices but I could be wrong.<br /><br />A product I had my eye on last week changed price twice in one day as the value of the bitcoin rocketed. We pay a premium for top quality gear on the Silk Road so you&#039;re always going to pay a bit more. <br /><br />With all the financial problems in the world I think we will see more bitcoin inflation. All those Russians that kept their money in the Cyprus banks are going to be looking for somewhere else to deposit it.<br /><br />

				Rules don&#039;t apply to certain markets.<br /><br />Drugs, for instance, belongs in a different market classification altogether. It is the one of the most dangerous commodity in existence, along with human trafficking. Hyperinflation? Addiction? Rape? Extortion? Murder?<br /><br />How volatile is this market? Money exists as long as there are goods. Arms Control has a tremendous effect on market price.

				I&#039;m pretty sure the vendors set their prices in USD and the site automatically converts the currency. Well i know this is the case but i&#039;m not sure if its optional feature to the vendors.

				Vendors have the option to choose whether listings are pegged to USD or BTC. Some prices will always appear to fluctuate with the BTC exchange rate, because not everyone has their prices pegged to the same currency.

If you are going to buy hold and offload I would do it soon. People speculate the &quot;bubble will burst&quot;. Who knows, it could go up for a while, it could tank over night. I&#039;ve made quite a bit over the past month and a half as it has gone up steadily. A $10,000 investment in bitcoin about a month ago when it was $15 a coin would have gotten you about 666.67 bitcoins. Today at about $85 a coin they would be worth 85-15*666.67=$45,000. Net profit of $35,000 in less than two months.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Recently, it even looked like BTC was tanking and everyone started screaming &quot;BUBBLE! BUBBLE!&quot;<br /><br />But then people started buying up coins like hotcakes as the price went down, and it bounced right back to where it started before the &quot;crash&quot; and kept on climbing. I don&#039;t think bitcoins are anywhere near the endgame yet.

				Goods are pegged to the US dollar but not in real time. You just have to get the best offers you can. Bitcoin could be up because of a ransom in it from some rich person that isn&#039;t telling the police and when the ransomers sell it will lose heaps of value again.
