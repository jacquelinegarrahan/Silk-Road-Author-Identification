				So, hypothetically speaking, here&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking about:<br />Get a cheap ounce off Silk Road, and re-sell it to somebody I know who deals on a street level. I could get it cheap enough, and it&#039;s expensive enough here, that I could make maybe £120 profit on each ounce. I could do this maybe weekly. I&#039;d get it shipped to a friend&#039;s house and pay him a small cut, then transport it straight from there to the dealer - at worst, keeping it at mine for a few days. All in all, it seems extremely possible to make £100/week extra money for minimal effort. I&#039;d never have more than an ounce in my possession at a time.<br /><br />I don&#039;t plan on carrying scales with me, nor do I plan on ever having him visit my house.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know from the more experienced among you, how does this plan sound? The only possible weakness I can see in it would be if the dealer gets caught by the police and turns me in - but I&#039;d only have an ounce at most in my possession - could I pass this off as personal use? I mean, for an ounce a week, it barely seems worth setting up a sting operation to prove I&#039;m dealing!<br /><br />Would it be worth delivering to the dealer in two goes - half an ounce each time, which I could possibly explain to the police as a &#039;personal use&#039; amount? Or would it be pointless? Would they be able to search my property once they found the first O (or half O) on me? I mean, I have a few class As there right now - they&#039;re for personal use, but I have enough that I might then qualify for &#039;with intent to supply&#039; with those too...<br /><br />And - most importantly - what would the punishment be, if worst comes to worst, and I get caught? Would it increase drastically if I went from selling an ounce a time to, say, two, three or four?

				You&#039;d be fairly unlucky to see the inside of a jail cell for an ounce, a friend of mine north of the border in Scotland (not sure if the sentencing works differently there) once got caught with something like 50 plants and spent a grand total of 1 night in the cells. He had a very, very good lawyer, but even so...<br /><br />I would say your biggest risks are from others turning you in. That&#039;s why I like the silk road so much ;)

				I read somewhere that a first time offender can be caught with weed up to nine ounces and avoid jail granted they have a decent lawyer and are willing to do a community payback order. <br /><br />I only know two people who got caught. Both with roughly 100 gram. One was jailed (he was only out of jail 3 weeks when caught) and the other was basically given a slap on the wrist. <br /><br />You wont be jailed (at least not for long enough to care) if you&#039;re caught with an ounce.

				Yeah a mate of mine got busted with a oz scales and baggies and he got a small amount of community service for the ordeal so punishments shouldn&#039;t be too extreme.
