				Dude, <br />you&#039;re probably just tripping... and that does do some strange things with you sometimes...<br /><br />I&#039;d advise you to enjoy the ride with Lucy and don&#039;t worry about your cock...<br />at least not for the coming 48h. <br /><br />Just go with the flow and fly away in the universe!&nbsp; :D

				You&#039;re not playing with the little monkey enough. When the monkey&#039;s bad, and they usually are, spank it. And spank it when it&#039;s not bad, just for good measure.
