				I got a hold of some 25c-nbome before finding SR and just pretty much used up my brain on it... I used about 5-6 times with only 2-3 days in between until basically nothing was happening when I dosed. got to SR (thank jesus) and now have some L and DOC on the way....<br /><br />want to make sure that my brain is balanced before i kick it on it&#039;s side with the real shit. Anyone use SAM-e? From what I understand it helps with serotonin levels. I&#039;m a bit ignorant but i&#039;m sure i read both LSD and DOC affect them.<br /><br />Is it reasonable to think with SAM-e I could probably dose when it gets here in a week and fly or should I give it the total 14 days? Today is only day 2 getting back to baseline and my stuff got shipped today.

				Even 14 days seems like a short period to let your brain and body recover from such frequent use as you described. I am no doctor nor am i trained in any medical field. But i do plenty of research before i do a drug. From what I have read 6 weeks is an ideal recovery period if you want to play it safe. If you are just thinking about getting high again, well thats another story. You will get high way before 6 weeks (although waiting longer certainly make you get LESS high). Surprised im the only one thats said anything on this thread. I would think there are plenty of people on here that could break it down a lot better than I can on why it is important to fully recover between dosing with serotonin depleting drugs. I suffered from depression, mood swings, and anger issues for months after I went on a binge doing ecstasy once or twice a week. I am finally feeling normal and will always wait at least a month between. Anyway just be smart and think about the long term. You dont want to over do it and end up talking funny and slobbering all over yourself just because you want to get high for days on end.

				Never tried DOC yet. Still have some DOI though and that sucks IMO.&nbsp; Ive probably dropped acid about 350 times. A week always seemed sufficient to me, but I always noticed if I did actually go a month or more w/o the trip would be really good but then again I always took higher doses than most.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;m going to get more nbome. Not that it&#039;s as good as cid but SOO much cheaper! If I bought cid on here it would cost me like $50 just for one dose! I like to do about 400-600ugs.

				I used to take 5-10 e pills on one trip (it would usually last 2 days) and then I would wait a few days and drop again. I did this for a good while til I ran out of pills and my connect dried up. Im glad it didnt go on any longer. Im sure it would have been bad if it did. But I have heard of plenty of people doing hits and hits of acid and coming out just fine. I never was lucky enough to have easy access to cid and be able to take hits and hits. Only done it a couple times (and I loved it). Moderation is key with any drug. I wouldnt recommend abusing any drug just because someone says it will be ok or that they have done it before and are ok now. Again, be smart. If we could all just get high everyday with no adverse side effects im pretty sure crack heads and meth addicts wouldnt exist. Drugs are not harmless and are not to be mistaken as harmless. Do the drug dont let the drug do you!
