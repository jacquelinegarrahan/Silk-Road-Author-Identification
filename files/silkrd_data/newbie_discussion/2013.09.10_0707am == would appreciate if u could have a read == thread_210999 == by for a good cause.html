				Before I start this is no joke. <br />My kid is going for an operation soon and the medical bills are costing a bomb (which we cannot afford) <br />I&#039;m asking people if they could donate some bit coin even if its only a few $ just to help us out. Family members are given some help also but we still need to gather up another few thousand (I don&#039;t expect it all from u guys) but if please u cud donate anything we would very much appreciate it. <br />Don&#039;t mean to hassle u with my troubles but hope some people could help out a small bit. <br />My deepest and kindest regards to all <br /><br />My bitcoin address. <br /><br />132QKcLw3W9r5qqcpHh4gYfwy6BkQ1UJ2F<br /><br />

				Good luck and all, but I don&#039;t think a sub-forum for getting your post count up is going to be the ideal fund raising place.

				Don&#039;t get me wrong but don&#039;t you think it&#039;s a little weird an account with as much as two posts is asking for donations for his sick kid ? I&#039;d be happy to help you but I don&#039;t know if my money will be put to good use, you know what I&#039;m saying ? How do I know your kid is really sick and you really NEED the money to pay for the expenses ?<br /><br />I really wish the best to you and your kid, I hope everything is gonna be alright. I&#039;m keeping an eye out on this thread. If more people decide to help you I&#039;ll throw in a few bucks aswell.

				Please don&#039;t take this the wrong way, but I don&#039;t think your appeal will be very successful.<br /><br />It&#039;s just that everybody on this site naturally looks at everything with a skeptical eye, and nobody has any reason to trust you, other than your assertion that they should.<br /><br />If what you say is true, then I wish you all the very best, but nobody has any way to verify what you say, and of all places on the internet, this is the one place people are inclined to treat things like this with skepticism. <br /><br />Peace.

				Uhhhh yeah.&nbsp; SR really isn&#039;t the place to come to try and raise money for your kid&#039;s operation. Not sure if you&#039;re not that familiar with the Road, but this place is more for buying things that you can&#039;t buy at Macy&#039;s and Rite Aid. <br /><br />My gut says that you&#039;re trying to get drugs for free. But as the above poster said, people here tend to have a more skeptical eye.<br /><br />I&#039;ll toss you some advice though. If you&#039;re really looking for the kindness of strangers to donate BTC for your kids operation, maybe try Reddit. That may be against their rules though? But reddit users are so much more kinder and optimistic. Especially if you have a good story and photos, or articles or something to back your claim. <br /><br />Coming to the Road and saying, after just joining, &quot;please donate some BTC to me for my kids operation; any amount would be good!&quot; is just iffy. If you&#039;re really serious, start a fund thats NOT connected to an SR account.
