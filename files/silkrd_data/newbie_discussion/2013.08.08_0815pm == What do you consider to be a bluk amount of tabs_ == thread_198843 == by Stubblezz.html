				I&#039;m planning to order some 25i blotters in the near future and had a thought as I was trying to decide where to have them sent. What exactly would be considered a bulk amount? I want to order at least x50. How much more likely would it be for this amount to be intercepted? I&#039;ve ordered various types of tabs a few times so far, but only in quantities of 5. It seems as if they&#039;re pretty easy to conceal at that amount, but I don&#039;t really know about larger orders.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for the info : )

				I am a noob, but I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re like paper. Wouldnt that be really easy to hide, since most mail is letters

				Seeing as they are essentially paper, and it&#039;s highly unlikely anyone is going to be opening it and having a proper look, I&#039;d say they&#039;re likely the safest thing of all to send/receive.

From what I understand, typically when small amounts of (insert drug here) for obvious personal use are found by the post, it&#039;s shrugged off and gotten rid of. Whereas a large amount is going to end up in a controlled delivery and whatnot. I&#039;m curious as to what would be enough to have LE come after you basically.<br /><br />Sorry if I didn&#039;t make my question very clear : \
