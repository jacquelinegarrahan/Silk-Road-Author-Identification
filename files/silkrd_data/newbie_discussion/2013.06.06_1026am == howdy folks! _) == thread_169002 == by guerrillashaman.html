				Hello everyone. So I got here. And have read a few words from a certain pirate. And he advised me to say hi here. It&#039;s nearly as exciting as a first day at new school or something :P<br />I&#039;ve also read some basic information about escrow system, bitcoins, shipping. I&#039;m hungry for handy knownledge, and becoming one of you, the best way I can. Oh, I also got here for some shroomies :)

				Thanks for the advice derry&nbsp; ;) I will sure remember it, for now, I&#039;ll just have to exchange money to account and I don&#039;t know what will I do with my home address for shipping yet, but.. I just want to buy shrooms, so it&#039;s the least thing sniffer dogs would be trained for. I think. We&#039;ll see. For sure, I&#039;d pick only trusted vendor and be veeery careful. Only educating myself for a few days and only then start to buy stuff.

				You need to encrypt personal information when you need to send it to someone, like your address when you want to buy something :)<br />never send personal information in clear text.

				welcome aboard matey<br /><br />two general rules to follow: never FE (but sometimes it&#039;s all right, which brings us to...) read everything you can about a vendor before buying. And read it on the forums! They are more reliable than feedback on vendor page.<br /><br />and if you&#039;re nervous about mail at all, read this: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171399.msg1228644#msg1228644">Quote from: TheGhosst on June 12, 2013, 07:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171399.msg1228604#msg1228604">Quote from: johnyv13 on June 12, 2013, 06:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">today at 12:00 pm a man with glasses, a beard, a dr. pepper shirt, and jeans rang my door bell. said i have a package for*********** i said ok.. he handed me a red slip to sign i said no.. he said ok. and left.. was this a CD or was my postman just not in uniform..... i have one hour to decide if i should go to post office and get it...... what shal i do<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What&#039;s the use of masking your name when you&#039;re describing the exact outfit the &#039;potential&#039; undercover cop was wearing; and what he looked like... <br /><br />Food for thought.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />TheGhost makes a good point, if it was in fact a controlled delivery. Probably it wasn&#039;t if he gave up that easily. That and the outfit makes me think he&#039;s just a normal postal worker who just doesn&#039;t give a fuck, and gets hundreds of signatures a day. BUT go with your instinct. Don&#039;t risk what you aren&#039;t willing to lose.<br /><br />In the meantime, check out this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165838.0<br /><br />happy buying!

				I said hi, but after this and few big topics read (A note from a postal worker also ;)) - Fortunately I live in a kind of a community that I don&#039;t worry about my postman that I know quite good. But still, I will remain very careful, thanks.<br />&nbsp;I completely forgot about the forums and now I see there are few unread replies to my greeting. It is a neglect from my side cause I want to be a full member for sure. What does it take to become one? Thanks to all of you for the advices. I am now after 7 fully successful purchases and spend 2.5 bitcoin. Of course started small. Good for me. I also learned how to use PGP. I am very happy with this site, I must write more on forums If I want to write outside the newbie discussion. And I want it very much.
