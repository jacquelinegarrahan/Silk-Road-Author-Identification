				* Public Service Announcement And Warning for Nooblets *<br /><br />The forums are dominated by paranoid technocrats.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over consumption of their mind numbing techno-dribble can result in paranoid thoughts, anxiety, loss of sleep, feelings of inadequacy, and helplessness.<br /><br />To counter these potential side effects, remember that a little bit of security and ordinary common sense is all that is required.<br /><br />If the only thing you do is properly set up your TOR browser and keep it updated&nbsp; and use PGP to encrypt you mailing address when placing an order, then you&#039;ve just covered yourself with a 95% security blanket.&nbsp; The rest of the precautions that are vociferously debated in these forums are spent chasing a pipe dream of 100% security.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not suggesting that those additional precautions aren&#039;t important, but I am suggesting that risk tolerance varies by individual.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are 80,000 people on the SR forums.&nbsp; My guess is there&#039;s 250,000 SR customers in total (assuming only 1 out of 3 register on the forums).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Let&#039;s examine this.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Of those 250,000 customers, I would guess that at least 100,000 are not using the most current version of TOR.&nbsp; As for the rest who do, I&#039;ll bet half don&#039;t have it set up properly (the right filters turned on).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But let&#039;s say I&#039;m wrong and only 10,000 fit that category.&nbsp; Forget that, let&#039;s take the dumbest 1,000 SR customers -- dumb-as-dirt fuck twads walking around with a blinking neon sign on their heads that screams&quot;BUST ME&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; One thousand begging-to-be-busted SR customers buying and receiving drugs through the mail, day in and day out.<br /><br />Now, let&#039;s compare that to how many people have been busted because their anonymity was compromised.<br /><br />*Zero*<br /><br />The point?&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Set up your TOR Browser, Learn PGP,&nbsp; and place an order.<br /><br />Carry on.<br /><br />====================================<br /><br />For Guides, check Sticky posts in the Newbie Section<br /><br />

				THISTHISTHISTHISTHISTHISTHISTHISTHISTHIS. Is what I&#039;ve been arguing for since my first post. If you aren&#039;t ordering ounces of hard stuff or pounds of weed; have taken the most basic reasonable precautions; and don&#039;t tell everyone you know you have/can get piles of drugs; go to fucking sleep soundly LE doesn&#039;t care about you and isn&#039;t going to waste resources investigating and staking out your goddamn house and mailbox 24/7. Instead, you should be paranoid about having drugs in your car, at work or school, or being ratted out by a &quot;friend&quot; irl. In reality you are 1,000,000 times more likely to be busted in those situations than with SR/mail, which is why most of us who don&#039;t buy drugs on the street love the place and you should be eternally grateful for it!
