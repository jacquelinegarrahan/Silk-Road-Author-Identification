				There is no exercise of the intellect which is not, in the final analysis, useless. A philosophical doctrine begins as a plausible description of the universe; with the passage of years it becomes a mere chapter—if not a paragraph or a name—in the history of philosophy.<br /><br />Thinking, analyzing, inventing are not anomalous acts; they are the normal respiration of the intelligence.<br /><br />Every man should be capable of all ideas.<br /><br />—Jorge Luis Borges, &quot;Pierre Menard&quot;

				The end comes when we no longer talk with ourselves. It is the end of genuine thinking and the beginning of the final loneliness.<br /><br />The remarkable thing is that the cessation of the inner dialogue marks also the end of our concern with the world around us. It is as if we noted the world and think about it only when we have to report it to ourselves.<br /><br />—Eric Hoffer

				Thanks Yoshitoshi for sharing.<br /><br />This 50 post limit is actually kinda nice. It give an idea of the quality of the posts to come and whether their reviews should count for anything. Take Lucas1313 for example, I wouldn&#039;t even bother reading a review by him, if he even bothers to write any.
