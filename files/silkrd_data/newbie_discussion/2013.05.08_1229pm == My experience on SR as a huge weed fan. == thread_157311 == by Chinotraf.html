				<br />&nbsp;Hey guys, just want to share my experience with newbies here :)<br /><br />&nbsp;If you want weed and you are looking for nice quality buds, just read this :)<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve ordered 9 times on SR, weed only, i despise hero√Øn for example don&#039;t talk to me bout this shit plz :p<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll give you advices for ordering.<br /><br />&nbsp;Mrouid is by far the best weed seller i&#039;ve met here, quality is nice and affordable, only problem is package cost but worth it, this guy is a motherfucking stealthsoldier ! Tasted cheese buds only, but rest of it is fine, i&#039;m sure. 1 week to Eu from canada.<br /><br />&nbsp;Spanishfly is really good too if you need some fast service. IT comes in 2 days in France from Spain and the seller is pretty nice.<br /><br />&nbsp;I recently tried Haizenberg, i am still waiting for the product, it takes ages but SR was down during my order soooo, not his fault :/<br /><br />&nbsp;Last thing... DO NOT order anything from Djabbar, this guy is a complete dick, his weed is sprayed, underweight and above all it takes more than a week to come to France from Netherlands.<br />Worst White widow i&#039;ve ever taste...<br /><br />&nbsp;Hope this helps :) Take care :)

				djabbar has sprayed weed, powerplant - but he states that, ive had the WW a few times what i recieved was never sprayed.<br /><br />The worrying thing is he is MIA now for 6 days, which he has had feedback in that time so most likely has some BTC still to withdraw, so something seems very wrong here.<br /><br />Come back djabbar, we miss you.
