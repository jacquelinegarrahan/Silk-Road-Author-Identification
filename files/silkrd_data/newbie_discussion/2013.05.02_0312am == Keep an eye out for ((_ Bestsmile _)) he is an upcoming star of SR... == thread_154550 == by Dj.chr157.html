				There is a new vendor hitting the SR that goes by the name &quot;Bestsmile&quot; he is just getting started and needs as much support as possible, he has 100 percent positive feedback idc who you are thats incredible an near impossible to pull off w. all the hackers and theives, Im ordering my Mephedrone M-cat from this mother fucker and let me just say his quality is unrivaled especially when you figure in the price...its rediculous 16g for a lil over a bill, thats INCREDIBLE, help get his name known and his numbers raised, because he deffinatly deserves it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Check him out on his new forum thread:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=147918.0<br /><br />Dj.Chr157

				I&#039;ve seen plenty of 100%.&nbsp; You sound like a shill to be honest and you look like one too with that 1 post count there buddy.&nbsp; I read what you wrote and I took it with relatively smal grain of salt and it left a bad taste in my mouth.&nbsp; The fact that paradiseone had to get an extion on his order is not a good sign.
