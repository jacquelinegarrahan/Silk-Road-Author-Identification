				Put simply...Mt. GOX sucks big time. I made a bank transfer to GOX 27 fucking days ago and I still cannot access my funds. First they used the age old &quot;we can&#039;t find your transfer&quot; scam, BULLSHIT. I triple checked everything before I made the transfer. After 5 days they finally answered my email inquiry and admitted they had it. I attempted to make a purchase on SR but I was told that my account had not been verified and I was number 25,256 in the cue for approval and it would take 10 business days to verify my information...10 fucking days? you have to be kidding me. Then they pulled that chicken shit stunt by closing trading. Hey GOX..if you are going to be a speculator then be one don&#039;t bail on people because you are taking it in the ass on Bitcoin prices, deal with it fuckers. During all of this I constantly receive automated messages when I try to log in to my account that state they have received too many failed log in attempts and my account has been locked for 24 hours. I have sent them at least 5 emails on this problem. Fucking retards.<br /><br />So today I am finally able to get into their website and the verification cue is gone. I figure that GOX has finally released their death grip on my money, wrong. I try to make a purchase and guess what? A message pops up that tells me my account has not yet been verified. That&#039;s it for me as soon as GOX will allow it I am taking my money and going some were else. Hopefully there is a Bitcoin exchange out there that isn&#039;t run by trained chimps.<br />

				ok, so to make sure I don&#039;t run into the same problem, since mining enough btc to make a purchase of any use will take months, if not gox, just look for someone local selling btc?

				I just use the Moneygram option that Mtgox offers and pay the $3.95 fee for doing the transfer for money to my Mtgox at a local business that offers Moneygram. Walmart, CVS, Schnucks, Banks.

				There are a lot of different ways to get BTC other than mtgox which for me has way too many hoops to jump through. I have used blue sky traders - quick, anon, and no bullshit.
