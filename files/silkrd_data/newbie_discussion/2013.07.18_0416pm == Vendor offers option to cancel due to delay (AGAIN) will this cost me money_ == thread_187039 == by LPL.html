				&nbsp;&gt;:(<br />&nbsp;I am not happy. Last week,my order was delayed.&nbsp; The vendor in question made it up with extra, so I went back thinking lightening wouldn&#039;t strike twice. Well stupid fucking me. 2 weekends fucked by this character. <br />&nbsp;He has offered me the option of taking extra for the wait again, or cancelling.&nbsp; Frankly, I don&#039;t want to wait until Tuesday for my shit again, but am I going to be stung for SR fees, if I take the cancel option.<br />&nbsp; If this happens 2 weeks in a row, that says to me that either he doesn&#039;t hold enough gear, and should take down his listings, or he&#039;s caning his own gear.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know from experience that he wont even read my reply to his message until tomorrow, so I have little chance of even getting something elsewhere in time.<br />&nbsp;As it is due to the vendor, surely he should eat the SR fee. We customers pay all the vendors listing fees in the price we pay even though the vendors claim they pay for them. Surely if the vendor hasn&#039;t got his shit together to have enough stock in or watch his listings and take them down when the orders reach the limit of his stock then he should be liable for cancellation fees. Why should someone else&#039;s slackness cost me money?&nbsp; It&#039;s not like he does a huge volume of orders, he gets a couple of feedbacks for this product every few days.<br />&nbsp;Not happy.

				&nbsp;He has read my reply,&nbsp; but hasn&#039;t bothered to reply to me. Clearly he wants it to be too late for me to order elsewhere.

				I&#039;m too much of a newbie to know much about this situation. However, if the item is not hedged, even if you get a full refund with the fluctuating price of BC you may end up either losing or gaining money from the initial purchase.

				I do not know what you are buying - but i think it&#039;s time to change vendors... I think you were nice enough to give them a second chance. <br />I&#039;ve only been a vendor on SR for about a week or so - but even I know not to fu&#039;k around with buyers delaying shipments and such, it&#039;s just bad business!<br /><br />

				If you cancel the order, fees will depend on whether or not the vendor uses escrow hedging.
