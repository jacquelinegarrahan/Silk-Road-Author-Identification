				Welcome!<br /><br />and as for why newbies can&#039;t post in other forums - who knows. If I had to guess - it&#039;d be one word - spam!

				the new rule now is you must have 50 post before being able to post in other sections. This is to help from all the spaming and bs posts.<br />It has its perks but kinda sucks also

				If you hang around the forums long enough you&#039;ll figure it out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been around SR for 6 mo and I&#039;d say that the largest reason is that there are so many dumb questions that could be answered by a forum search and reading a few threads.<br /><br />The experience that buyers and vendors have gained (especially those who form the core of these forums) is hard earned.&nbsp; I have literally spent hours before scouring posts for info on tor security, BTC, vendor reviews, anything you can think of.&nbsp; <br /><br />Members with this knowledge are generally very helpful to newbies who can show some initiative, but nobody wants to spoonfeed and already exploding SR population.&nbsp; Not because they&#039;re being exclusive, but its not doing you any favors to learn the simplest step-by-step tutorials.&nbsp; If you really want to use SR safely and reliable there is a very large learning curve, but its 100% worth the time!<br /><br />*Sorry if that came off as a lecture.&nbsp; I still consider myself a newbie compared to 90% of the forum, just try to help out my buddies! haha
