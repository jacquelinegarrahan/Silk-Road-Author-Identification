				Lol it&#039;s alright dude I spent weeks figuring this out before I took the plunge. The easiest way to learn how to do things is by watching youtube tutorials (which I think that you&#039;ll have to be on the clearnet to do so close tor to do that or fire up your tablet). First you wanna figure out bitcoins, there&#039;s several ways to get them that I&#039;ve used: coinbase and bitinstant in particular. Bitinstant is one of the fastest ways to get bitcoins so it&#039;s worth the small fees that come with using it (they&#039;re really not that big). There&#039;s plenty of guides on youtube and vimeo that show how this works (the one I saw was on vimeo, you can find it just by searching for it). Coinbase is also super easy to use, just link up your bank account (I used my checking) and you can buy up to 10bitcoins per day (or something like that) from your computer without going to a physical location like with bitinstant (which lets you buy bitcoins using moneygram at places like walmart and cvs). Now remember bitcoins are totally legal, there is no reason to use a fake name at all, your real information is totally safe to work with.<br />&nbsp;Once you&#039;ve watched a few videos on that and understand how to get bitcoins we move on to pgp encryption. It&#039;s not necessary as the silkroad encrypts everything automatically but it&#039;s a nice way to stay extra safe in case the silkroad gets compromised. If you&#039;ve got a windows computer you&#039;re in luck as there&#039;s some really good youtube guides on how to get pgp working. Gpg4win is the program you&#039;ll use if you&#039;re running windows and there&#039;s a tutorial from a youtube account called &quot;tony montana&quot; that has a perfect guide for it. Just search gpg4win and silkroad on youtube and you&#039;ll find it.<br />&nbsp;Once you&#039;ve sorted out how to get bitcoins and use pgp it&#039;s onto actually making a purchase. Research your vendors on the forums, and if you&#039;re skeptical try to find a vendor who doesn&#039;t require Finalizing Early (FE for short, most new buyers are required to FE but not all vendors will make you). You can also message vendors in case you have any questions, most will get back to you within a day or so. Message me if you have any more questions :) Good luck and happy shopping.

				Welcome to the community, or like some like to call it the Silk Road family. I&#039;d suggest to take your time with Silk Road and learn everything before making any purchases. <br /><br />I suggest going to this thread: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=115125.0 - and look at some guides here. It&#039;s still very small, but more and more links will be added everyday to assist users like you. You can also use the [Search] function and enter tags that are of interest to you, in which case you&#039;ll find the threads related to your criteria.<br /><br />~ Cooler.
