				^^^ no no no don&#039;t quote it, delete the quote. That&#039;s some asshat that has some script running to keep registering as a new user and just keep pasting that junk for some uncool reason.<br /><br />Well if LE takes over an account, first they&#039;d have to get the username and password from the person. Supposing they did, if everyone had encrypted their address/sensitive info with PGP like you&#039;re supposed to, there wouldn&#039;t be much for LE to see. They&#039;d see the orders and amounts and stuff but no one&#039;s address/shipping info. Now if they also got the vendor&#039;s private key then that would be an issue. Or if they gained access to other records of the vendor either willfully or just because s/he didn&#039;t keep a clean and encrypted computer then that could be a problem. Then I would think they would be most interested in large volume purchases possibly indicating other vendors/dealers.

				Once they catch a vendor, they&#039;re done, the goal is to catch the dealers, they wouldn&#039;t and probably aren&#039;t allowed to mail drugs to people. LE doesn&#039;t want to pu tin all the work of a controlled delivery when they could just drive down the street and arrest someone on the street for the same amount of drugs but a fraction of the effort.

				Right, let&#039;s hope not. Assuming a vendor uses return addresses not closely tied to him/her there should be minimal risk of getting caught to begin with, unless maybe they somehow get caught dropping it into a bluebox. The bigger risk seems to be some vendor saving all the info and then going batshit crazy and posting it all over the place.

				Right on. The weakest point in PGP is in the decryption. I have heard of some vendors threatening previous buyers later with revealing their information if they don&#039;t send them 1BTC for example. Problem there is blackmail like that could go on forever. Maybe the paid informants just need to be paid more.

I have seen issues where people have been foolish to hand up their information to forum members with no vendor account lured by the prospect of a free sample only to have their identifiable information used in an extortion attempt. If you have real evidence of vendors doing this please pass it on the the admins otherwise all you are doing is spreading FUD.

				Well right, the details have to be stored, at least long enough for the vendor to make the shipment. If the delivery address is encrypted properly, SR itself has no idea what the delivery address is. Now if you have unscrupulous people out there trying to buy customer lists off vendors, well, now that is a completely different story.

				I don&#039;t think all vendors keep detailed records of previous customers addresses and purchases. I&#039;m sure some do. Of those that do I&#039;m sure some could be persuaded with the right amount of money to give out that list. But it wouldn&#039;t be all vendors. Why would someone buy and post such a list? To discredit SR - it would most likely be SR&#039;s largest competing site or possibly even two or more such sites in collusion. If SR goes down or people are afraid to use it, it means users heading in droves to competing sites.
