				Dude. It&#039;s ordering drugs over the internet. it&#039;s risky regardless, it just depends on the vendor&#039;s stealth. No one can accurately answer this.

				more than 5 years ago, I ordered &lt;+10-15 blisters online from india.<br />It arrived without stealth, package had the typical blister sound of shaking pills.<br />Two weeks later I got a letter by customs I should show up with them, they need my presence to open a package.<br />The vendor shipped the very same package again (wouldve been nice if it wasnt caught). Had to let it be destroyed.<br />bottom: 50% arrival rate for me, will not order from india again. <br />there is one vendor here claiming a 100% success to europe, would love to know his stealth method.<br />

				His stealth method is that he ships it inside live cattle, and has another man cut them open when they arrive, and ship it domestically.
