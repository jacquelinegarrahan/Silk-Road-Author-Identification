				Hello,<br /><br />Today I made my first bitcoin deposit to my sr account. I used bitinstant to send $260.00 (after all fees) to my sr bitcoin walllet address. I just checked my account now and it show that I only have $215.00! <br /><br />I&#039;m very confused, I just paid $270 all together minus $14 in fees and I did not even receive the full amount. Does silkroad take a fee for first time bitcoin deposits? What should I do?<br /><br />Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

				Most likely it&#039;s just the BTC &lt;-&gt; USD exchange rate not being the same value everywhere... this is more of a problem lately with the large changes in price. You should just check that you got the same number of coins you sent over.

				Hey, I am just starting to learn about the bitcoins myself and have done a few transactions, one thing I have noticed is that there is a big fluctuation every day.<br />It is super confusing. And just wait, once you start to go onto bitcoin trade sites, it gets even more confusing. But...from what I&#039;ve read so far, those trade sites and earn you some serious extra bitcoins.&nbsp; You just have to figure out how to do that.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t gotten even remotely close to that yet unfortunately.<br /><br />Good luck to you and to all of us &quot;newbies&quot;<br /><br />If anyone with a little more experience could reply with any helpful suggestions, I would certainly appreciate it! As I am pretty certain we all would.<br />Thanks

				i normally keep a little bit in the kitty in case of major inflation but aside from that order straight away so i get my moneys worth in case of deflation<br /><br />i&#039;d be screwing if i&#039;d bought a load of coins last week for $175+ and now they&#039;d more than halved in value<br /><br />i&#039;m sure they&#039;ll go back up again but would just be annoying waiting for the economy to sort itself out
