				Going to assume you are from the UK due to you using the term sort code.&nbsp; Typically the anon debit cards are not from UK banks, one of the well known ones are from Poland.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to do an international transfer to get money into them.&nbsp; Last time I did an international transfer in a branch I had to fill in a form, but I&#039;m sure plenty of smart people can reload them anonymously.&nbsp; But of course you can transfer money from a legit bank account to the anon account, if you don&#039;t mind leaving an electronic link between your bank account and the anon one.&nbsp; Depends what is at stake!
