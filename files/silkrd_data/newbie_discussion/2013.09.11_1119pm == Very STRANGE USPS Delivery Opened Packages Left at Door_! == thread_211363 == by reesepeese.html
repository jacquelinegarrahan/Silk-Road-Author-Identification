				So I&#039;ve made over ten orders in the past year, but my last 2 were the strangest. I need to know if I should be worried! Because I kind of already am! Out of all of my orders, most of them were international. The last 2 were domestic, U.S., from 2 different states, so 2 different vendors, and I had ordered them about a week a part from each other. I probably should&#039;ve waited to receive the first one before I ordered again, but I didn&#039;t think it would be a problem. Any other domestic order has only taken at the most 4 days, so after 5 days I began to worry (naturally when waiting for any order off SR!). On the 9th day, about a week or so ago, I left my apartment that morning and I came back, nothing out of the ordinary. And about 2 hours later I ran out to my car to look for something, and when I was walking up to my door I noticed I had 2 of the bigger USPS envelopes, tacked next to my door using the clip that my apartment complex usually uses to hang fliers. These were not there when I got home earlier in the day. There were MULTIPLE things that I found very strange about this:<br /><br />1. The mail NEVER comes to my door. We have one of those group mail boxes that we have to walk about a block to. The packages should have been big enough to fit into our mailbox, and if not, we are usually given a key to a bigger mail box.<br /><br />2. The mail NEVER comes that early. The mail always arrives at 5 pm every day. I found this tacked to my door at 1 pm.<br /><br />3. BOTH packages were OPENED. But everything was still in both. One was an 8th of hash oil and the other was 10 g of hash oil. I should mention that the 8th of hash oil was leaking in the vacuum seal though.<br /><br />Can someone PLEASE tell me what they think happened to my packages ???! From what I have read, if it were opened by the postal office or LE they would have either seized it and I would have received a letter, or they would have gave it back with a note or sticker telling me it was searched, or I would have gotten a CD. (Please correct me if I am wrong!) But my situation fits neither of these cases, so where does that leave me??

				That does seem really strange...<br /><br />Did you end up grabbing the packages and taking them inside anyway or did you leave them out there and act like you weren&#039;t expecting them? If it was the latter and you took them in and nothing happened, I wouldn&#039;t make TOO big a deal over it but I would suggest using a different location from now and OR getting a PO box if you can&#039;t do the first. Obviously something is going on with the address you used... If you haven&#039;t been arrested by now don&#039;t worry too much but you should seriously consider not using that address again.

				Ask your leasing office. Specifically ask under what circumstances might USPS packages be delivered to your door in the manner you experienced. Their answer will be very telling. <br /><br />Remember, don&#039;t self incriminate. <br /><br />This is my two cents.

				The easiest way to tell if it is a controlled delivery is to leave the house. If you drive away, LE will apprehend you before you get to the car. If the product gets away, they lose their case against you.<br /><br />Usually when I get a package, I immediately write &quot;return to sender&quot; on it and walk out to my car. Drive around the block and come back. This is enough to know it is not a sting. If in fact it is a sting, I would go with the story that I was not expecting a package and am headed to the post office to return it. Deny, deny, deny!

				Thats really strange, and like&quot; Occams razor&quot; said, don&#039;t self incriminate.

				I am not in the US but if I was I would be returning them to the post office asking questions. yes sounds incriminating but on the way take out the contents and take to a place noone would know about and show the post office and say you dont know the name of the persom who sent you this or there address and if your as stubborn as me sign a statutory decleration saying this but only if you dont know this as if you purchased from a SR vendor you dont know the name or address of who sent it let alone there subburb or even if for 100% that there male or female. in the readers eyes your signing a statutory decleration that you didn&#039;t even order it but NEVER! do that unless that is the 100% truth. only declare what is true in these legal documents as you never know what maybe proveable. if taken to court and they have evidence for some freaky reason then you can in your defence say &quot;I didnt write that I didnt know about it just that I didnt know the name of the sendor or there address. <br /><br />if you worded it as I said to they can read it again and they will realise you are being 100% correct<br /><br />be very careful what you sign especially a legal document like a statutory decleration. upto 5years in club fed isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />P.S. if you truely dont remember taking a dump on the 6th sept 2013 at 2:13pm you can sign a stat dec stateing that you to your memory at this exact time (put current time) did not to your knowlege evacuating my (YOUR FULL NAME) bowels at 2:13pm on the sixth day of september in the year two thousand and thirteen (1013) <br /><br />even tho you may have been doing so at this time you just dont remember. <br /><br />if your worried about being stopped by LE on the way make a phone call to the post office saying who you are and brief details of what your going there for. even a fax to them saying your name and that your takeing a letter that your worried about maybe incriminating but you dont know the exact source of it and are coming in to report it so that way you can say &quot;hey I am on my way to well in your case USPS agent &quot;location&quot; to sign a legal document that you dont know who sent it or exactly where it came from&quot; there going to say regardless if the content is there or not your lieing. well you have an Official faxed letter from yourself at either a official building or agent of to back yourself up right then or in the future that that was no lie. get cought out on a lie they have every reason to not believe anything you say after that just like ya wife.<br /><br />once at the post office show them. see what they have to say. tell them you will hold on to them but you want to sign something to say that you dont know the sendor or there name (unless you do and there a friend dont do this if a vendor then there not going to give even close to there real name or address) and your not handing them the envolopes to keep anyway or a copy of it. if LE are responsible they have every last bit of information and possible DNA off it anyway so what you show them of the outside is nothing there just people doing there job.<br /><br />Sign a stat dec as I said stating you no not know the name of who sent it nor there address and if you dont know there providence then state that if your shure you dont know there state then even better! just because it was sent from Ohio doesnt mean it wasn&#039;t sent from Michigan. some send parcels of 100+ envolopes half way accross the country via an express package to someone else to post near you and that way faster delivery to you yet making it confusing for LE as to your where abouts.<br /><br />1 vendor sends to 4 lovations every 2 days express of 50+ orders to very trusting business partners accross USA to send donestic that will get to you 24 hours later is good business practice in my eyes. confuse LE get deliveries to customers 2-3 days early without paying priority on everything as well saving money.<br /><br />if I had a vendors account and had 2 trusted others in the opposite corners of AU I would use it some places take 5-6 days if not express. if I sent 25 orders overnight to each of these to send road it would be 2 mabe 3 days tops to get to buyer not 5-6 WA/TAS and far north QLD are the 3 corners of AU I think.<br /><br />either stock at 3 locations or one that opens a big overnight package and dumps in the mail to be delivered next day just because its stamped denvor in US or WA in Australia doesnt mean it didn&#039;t come from Hamilton Island.<br /><br />I have a feeling 1 seller in the US does this. no names but I have ordered about 8 orders to 3 addresses close by to me and they have come from different states and one even came from canada. ordered from same vendor and the product looked exactly the same and every time its packaged different right down to the zip bag. atleast 6 completely different bag sizes and thicknesses the Canada one had USA been packed in the US I am shure but I wont give out anything more about that. <br /><br />bye. dont lie of a legal document just the truth! its amazing what you honestly dont know that can set you free.

				&nbsp;Someone was going to rob your shit, but didn&#039;t know what it was. And so they gave it back to you. At least your thief is a nice person.&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; Seriously though do you ever get, or others get your mail. Last time I checked apt mail boxes are anything but locked securly. Someone possibly got your packages, opened them. Didn&#039;t know wtf was in there and so gave it back. Probably a nieghbor. Obviously you left, they seen you leave. And put the things on your door. Or seen you received packages, jimmied your lock. Took them. Didn&#039;t. Know what it was. Gave it back. I would watch your shit though. Never know if that said nieghbor will narc. Prrobably not if they are a dirty thief.&nbsp; That would be my guess over any LE or &quot;official&quot;post office activity. But how long were you gone?&nbsp; And your packages were opened, not taped back shut or anything. Definetly a nireghbor, especially if you were gone less than 15 minutes. Mailman would have came at mail time with packages taped back shut. If it was a sting your package would be carrfully opened and closed to appear legit. Not fucking ripped open like that. Post office has to put opened by customs. Received a package like that ordering a ready to grow shroom kit. Open and grow. It got threw but customs fucked up the seal and it got contaminated. I also had a peyote plant in their they missed/didn&#039;t know. Anyways, watch your shit. Play it safe, but I doubt you have any worries from the packages. Although someone now knows you get brown/black oily goo stuff in the mail. So I would just move.&nbsp; &nbsp;
