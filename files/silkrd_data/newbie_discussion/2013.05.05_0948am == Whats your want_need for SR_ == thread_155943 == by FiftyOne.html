				I&#039;m just here because of my line of work actually. Economically by the time I see a doc (subsidised healthcare too in my country) &amp; convince them what I want, then I need to take time off work, which get quite a high hourly rate, plus the driving around....&nbsp; &nbsp; well, i can get mail order product posted to me in the mail. &amp; it probably work out cheaper.&nbsp; The other thing is I&#039;m more of a rec user<br /><br />You?

				I&#039;m mostly here for the weed. My doc keeps wanting to shove pills down my throat when I am perfectly aware that some MJ easily takes care of the things that ail me. Due to my location and other factors, it&#039;s difficult and pretty risky for me to find a supplier around here. I&#039;ve had a couple but they all became flaky, couldn&#039;t keep up with my demand or were highly suspect in their dealings; plus their shit was crap. I was putting up my own but a bad winter killed it and took the wind out of my sails. So in the end, it&#039;s down to availability, quality and convenience.

				I&#039;m here for acid. I&#039;m in a new city with no connects. And other than small batches of prescriptions it&#039;s the only thing that doesn&#039;t make me paranoid about receiving in the mail. I know 99% of weed/coke/H orders go just fine but I&#039;m paranoid :p Plus I can still pass your average drug test after taking &#039;cid. :D

				Medicinal Cannabis. I&#039;m here because I can get it at great prices and have it brought to where I am. It gives me the opportunity to bring something more to those that need it in my area and allows me to make a living while doing it. The only way to truly be happy is to find your passion and follow it. That&#039;s what I am doing and SR and others like me are making it happen. :)

				<br /><br />I&#039;m here because I&#039;m pretty much tired of all of the dumbasses, dry spells, and douche bags you have to put up with if you buy a little smoke from someone local every now and then. Comparatively, the little extra you pay in price is worth the headache you save from not having to deal with a dumbass. ;)

				This has been hashed and rehashed in the past, but to answer your question the way most will: money (if it&#039;s a distributor) OR affordable, quality, tested product with little to no risk (if it is a user).

				I wasn&#039;t sold on the SR until I saw the community involvement. Buyers keeping sellers as honest as possible is what makes this place interesting to me, and I&#039;m glad to check out some chems that I was not able to as a lad-- for fear that they were fake/adulterated/etc.

				I&#039;m here to make money basically. I buy cheap on here and then flip locally for massive profit. I basically browse this site for hours looking for the best deals
