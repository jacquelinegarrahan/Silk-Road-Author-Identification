				I feel like this thread should be more about local specialties when it comes to drugs. Anyone can say &quot;yea my favorite drug in my area is the fat dutch moon rocks I get off SR&quot;.<br /><br />Well anyways my favorite local specialty is the mint press. So many colors and imprints in my collection yet all so thin and crumbly yet packed with MDMA. A bit more expensive than higher dosed dutch pills but they are by far the pride and joy of pressed pills in America.&nbsp; ;D

				My favorite thing that was around my area for a bit and I wish would come back was this ecstasy I was getting. I never found out if it had an exact name or not but it was a capsule with 3 different types of ecstasy in it that equaled the amount of 2. They were 30 bucks each too which was a nice break from the 20 each. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s cause there was a mix of ecstasy in them but when I took those I never rolled harder in my life. Those were definitely my favorite and I haven&#039;t seen them for about 5 months which is pretty disappointing.
