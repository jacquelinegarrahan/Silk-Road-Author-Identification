				I understand the reason for wanting to vet accounts but I am a vendor from over a year ago, have old topics in offers and reviews, and can&#039;t post there now. The idea makes sense but it is broken. This is my 50th post. I was lucky to have 39 from before. I feel bad for the rest of you.

Administrators can, but by the time they get around to a person&#039;s request the member in questions will usually always have reached 50+ posts. As far as I&#039;m aware, this has never been done in any event.<br /><br />It also isn&#039;t fair on people that do not have a vendor account. Simply because one person can afford a vendor account and another cannot, should they be awarded extra privileges here? I don&#039;t think so. We already have a two-tier system like that in real-world society, where they who can afford it are privy to more than they who cannot. This is not something we wish to replicate here.<br /><br />Libertas
