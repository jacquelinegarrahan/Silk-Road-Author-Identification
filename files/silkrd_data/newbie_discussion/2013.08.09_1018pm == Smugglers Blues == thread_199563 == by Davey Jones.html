				With all this tsa stuff, body scanners, and trained searchers, bringing shit on a plane is just too risky.&nbsp; I&#039;d say its probably alot easier and safer to send send a &#039;package&#039; on ahead so its waiting for you.<br />Upscale hotels will cooperate by holding packages til you get there.

				True. I was gonna try to smuggle thru airport once... Some1 close to me had a dream about it and it didnt go good for me (btw they didnt know anything about what i was planning). But when they told me i decided to drop it. Like jeezy said &#039;i want that bread but i dont need that time.&#039;

				It really just depends on what you&#039;re moving. A few blotters or capsules are pretty much no problem at all.<br />Kilos on the other hand...

				The TSA<br />Now they&#039;re easy to play&nbsp; :)<br />for a second let&#039;s say<br />that a pill press was made;<br />and your RX for Ritalin LA<br />was cloned with MDMA!<br />It&#039;s as easy as 1, 2, 3!<br />1. Now your friends all have ADD,<br />2. And their doctors write for free.<br />3. Your chemist smiles with glee,<br />and extracts the crushed pressies.<br />8)

				Safest way to avoid TSA is send it on ahead, a hotel clerk will sign for it and hold it if you have a reservation.&nbsp; Then, you act like your in town on business(really, you are lol)then you get the package, up to the room, use the hideaway method(in the wall)and its on from there.&nbsp; Those first class flights usually offer free drinks and a free meal, the stewardesses wait on you like waitresses, nice.&nbsp; Plus, you can send more than one package on ahead to keep the weight down on individual boxes.&nbsp; If you wanna get high on the flight, just do it before boarding.

				If your not going international its pretty easy. Last time i flew i brought a few capsules of MDMA in the bottom of a pill bottle in my carry on, no tsa agent even blinked an eye. i dont know about most places but from what ive seen tsa agents really dont give a shit about their jobs anyway. if you keep it small and domestic its really easy just be a little clever

				I don&#039;t see what the worry is if it&#039;s under a couple grams.&nbsp; I generally take bubble hash and compressed herb with me when flying.&nbsp; Use to just carry it in my pockets, but those body scanner machines are a new nuisance.&nbsp; Hide it somewhere good, pack it deep, and forget about it.&nbsp; A friend has been keeping his herb in a pair of dirty socks for years but he has lost it a couple times.&nbsp; TSA leaves a note saying contraband was removed from your luggage.&nbsp; I personally try and be a little more thoughtful on hiding.&nbsp; I&#039;ll sew the gear inside a pair of jeans or something else.&nbsp; Somewhere it can&#039;t be felt or retrieved easily.... I also do this on all international flights.&nbsp; Obviously this is for small personal amounts.&nbsp; A couple grams of hash lasts me a good vacation.<br /><br />Even though I have no quarrels with carrying, I think I will start shipping.&nbsp; Silk Road has given me new confidence in our postal system.&nbsp;
