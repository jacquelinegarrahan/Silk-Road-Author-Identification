				Hi silky people,<br /><br />So I made my first purchase the other day, and i&#039;m excited as fuck, however it&#039;s been two days now and my order is still &#039;processing&#039; ...is this normal/odd?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been told before that I tend to get impatient, so it&#039;s probably just that, but i feel it&#039;s a bit strange.. also on the vendor page he promises that he should be able to send it within a day&#039;s time. I also noticed though that he encourages his buyers to FE, however I don&#039;t see that option and after reading a hell lot of posts on the forum i can understand that FE&#039;ing is a bad idea.<br /><br />So yeah, i&#039;m just looking for someone to tell me this is normal and i should just be patient, i guess :D

				The first three days you don&#039;t have this option to FE.&nbsp; <br />Now you have made the order you can see how many transaction has your vendor and more....<br />My advice if you have a small order do not FE. You can not be froced to FE <br /><br />I like to talk with the vendor before I make the order .<br />In this way you can now a lot asking everything you want to know..<br />

				Congrats on taking the plunge and making your purchase!!&nbsp; I&#039;m about 8 purchases deep myself.&nbsp; And I&#039;ve been reading this forum and the subreddit for weeks.&nbsp; What I&#039;ve learned about FE is to never do it.&nbsp; Especially for your first purchase.&nbsp; There are enough vendors to choose from that don&#039;t require FE, that you can stay clear of the ones that do.<br /><br />As far as &quot;in processing&quot;, that varies from vendor to vendor.&nbsp; But there&#039;s no need to worry about your money.&nbsp; It&#039;s in escrow.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not comfortable with how long it&#039;s taking for him to ship it out, then send a message asking what&#039;s up with the order.&nbsp; I had this happen twice - one vendor said it would be another few days til he could ship, so I asked him to cancel my order (the coins are put right back into your SR wallet).&nbsp; The other time, the vendor apologized and said he got backed up on orders and shipped on the 3rd day.<br /><br />Note that many vendors promise &quot;fast shipping&quot; on their profile page.&nbsp; And it might be their goal to always ship immediately.&nbsp; But you know how the game can be. . . things don&#039;t always go according to plan.&nbsp; I would offer this advice though, if you&#039;re in a hurry: pick a vendor that offers express shipping.&nbsp; Not all of them do, so you might have to click through a few pages until you find one.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve done this a few times this week and gotten my order within 48 hours.&nbsp; Totally worth the extra $$&nbsp; because I am trying to party hard tomorrow night.<br /><br />Good luck man

				hey, thanks alot for your replies.. and yeah i&#039;m both scared of myself taking the plunge, and at the same time proud of actually doing it :D ...the biggest struggle for me was really getting the bitcoins, hehe<br /><br />but what i get from both of you is that you&#039;re encouraging to get in contact with the vendor, and i guess i&#039;m just a bit shy since this is all fairly new to me.. I&#039;ve travelled around other dirty parts of the internet, but this still feels totally different.<br /><br />So yeah, thanks for the input<br /><br />EDIT: And have a blast tomorrow, i&#039;m getting all jealous now.. it&#039;s been over a year since i last partied on anything other than beer... but I know my turn will come :)

				Usually depends on the vendor but if the order has been processing for &gt;3 days, I&#039;d say shoot them a message just to see whats up. <br />Once the order is &#039;in transit,&#039; you&#039;ll the have option to FE but I recommend against it for obvious reasons

				I agree with the previous poster- it can&#039;t harm to drop the vendor a polite msg and ask when he will ship.<br />Also, as per what was previously said, there are enough vendors who don&#039;t require FE for you to be able to avoid those that do, I can&#039;t see the advantage for a new purchaser.

				The key is being polite. It also helps to not psych yourself out. SR is pretty good at helping people out who&#039;ve been scammed outright. I usually wait three days if a vendor advertises a speedy delivery, longer if not. A good vendor will always get back to you quickly, though. That is, if you&#039;ve sent them a legitimate question/comment.

				Patience is definitely a virtue. That&#039;s about the only thing that transfers from the street onto SR. Waiting.
