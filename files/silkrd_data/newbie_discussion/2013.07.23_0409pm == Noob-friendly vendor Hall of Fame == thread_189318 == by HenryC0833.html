				It&#039;s tough being a noob!&nbsp; You&#039;ve taken your cram course on internet security, spent hours setting up your computer, and weeks reading the forums, and now you&#039;re ready to place an order.&nbsp; Except!&nbsp; The most highly-rated vendors either won&#039;t do business with you, or expect you to finalize early.<br /><br />Well, not all of them don&#039;t.&nbsp; Let&#039;s start a thread where we hail vendors who give us miserable noobs a chance.&nbsp; Give &#039;em credit when they treat us right.<br /><br />Please.&nbsp; Don&#039;t screw this up.&nbsp; Trust is a two-way street.&nbsp; So treat these guys right, finalize when you get your order, and if you&#039;re not 5-star satisfied, give them a chance to fix it before you flame all over the forums. <br /><br />Two categories.<br /><br />NON-SENSITIVE ITEMS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good way to build up your stats, and practice your encryptions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I nominate two:<br />1.&nbsp; febbraio2468.&nbsp; &nbsp;He has test kits.&nbsp; The kind the fuzz will use against you, if you&#039;re not careful.&nbsp; Look, if you&#039;re ordering up acid or MDMA these days, you should test it when you get it.&nbsp; Hit this guy up.&nbsp; He will hook you up, won&#039;t make you FE early, and ships super-fast.<br />2.&nbsp; SgtAmerica.&nbsp; You need some shades, can&#039;t be walking around with dilated pupils and your eyes rolling around in your head.&nbsp; The Sergent can send you some damn fine shades for not too much BTC, and he will give you good marks.<br /><br />PURVEYORS OF FINE CHEMICALS.&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you have one or two transactions under your belt, go for the gusto.&nbsp; <br />1.&nbsp; Aidoneus.&nbsp; Huge buzz over on the grown-up forums about his clean, hard-hitting MDMA done up in stealthy little capsules.&nbsp; The word you hear over and over again is &quot;professionalism.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;He really wants you to be happy.&nbsp; (Extremely happy!)&nbsp; Definitely worthy of noob coin.<br />2.&nbsp; BlueViking.&nbsp; A well-established vendor who&#039;s&nbsp; in with the in-crowd, having received a coveted endorsement from the LSD Avengers.&nbsp; The Viking is the nicest guy in the world.&nbsp; Patiently answered a noob question I sent him, which I realize now was a little inconsiderate.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t mean to!&nbsp; And he was nice about it.&nbsp; So first chance I got, I sent in an order.&nbsp; And he filled it, lickety-split.&nbsp; Great guy, quality product.<br /><br />OK!&nbsp; This is the Hall of Fame thread.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be all bitchy here, this is for positive experiences with vendors who deserve our business!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The envelope please....

				We would have liked to see this thread take off a little more. Aside from the fact that you headlined us as a solid vendor (we&#039;d like to think so), this seems like a pretty good idea. We definitely understand that it IS hard being a &#039;noob&#039;. We also really just hope you all respect the fact that it&#039;s not always easy being a vendor and working with &#039;noobs&#039; as well.&nbsp; ::) ::)<br /><br />As Henry so eloquently put it, give credit where it&#039;s due. Respect is earned, and it&#039;s a two-way street.&nbsp; ;D<br />Cheers.<br />.Whish.
