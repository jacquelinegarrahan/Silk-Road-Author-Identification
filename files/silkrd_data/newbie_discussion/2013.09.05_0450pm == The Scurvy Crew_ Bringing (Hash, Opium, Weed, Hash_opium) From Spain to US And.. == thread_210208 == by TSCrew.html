				Newest info straight from ACE:<br /><br />Were Back in flow people!<br />98% success rate over the last 2 weeks. New shipping methods in full swing!<br /><br />Please don´t discuss our new flat pack methods publicly no matter how awesome you think they are. And yes if you place an order you can chose the color, you´ll know what I mean when you receive a couple of packages.<br /><br />We only issued 4 refunds for the whole theft scandal and 90% of the reships have arrived (waiting on 2 AUS pacakges, 2 US packages and one to Germany).<br />So thanks to all for sticking with us.<br /><br />Now that we are rolling well after the scandal, as I promised we will be listing new products. Ketamine and peruvian fishscale coke (Actual pure shizzle not a 50% cut sold as fishscale so another possible number 1 for us on SR as I suspect none of the other coke on here is actually fishscale)<br /><br />Were working on a new method to eliminate the nosclapine content from our Ladanum, producing a purer product<br /><br />Also for all ye tweakers, ACE is gonna start cooking up meth soon :D:D<br /><br />As always, any questions to me, also keep the good vibes coming<br /><br />ALWAYS REMEMBER SCURVY CREW IS THERE FOR YOU AND WILL ALWAYS COME THROUGH ;) SCREWBIES GET FIRST DIBS ON NEW PRODUCTS AIGHT.<br /><br />

				If you are a newbie, I highly recommend these guys. <br /><br />From the very beginning, they have had not just punctual and informative communication, but they are warm and welcoming as well. They understand that being new to this whole process can be intimidating at times, and ACE really took the time to make me feel like a valued customer despite having 0 transaction history. He helped me build a customized kit from their array of products that suited my personal needs and preferences. <br /><br />My order is entire opiate based, but something really refreshing about TSC that you don&#039;t see with other vendors in their listings is TSC makes your order for you when you order it when it comes to products like Laudanum and Bayer Opium. The stuff is being made fresh for you which has a very mom and pop feel to it, which I like a lot. Hell, find another vendor on SR that even offers Laudanum! I had been reading the Aubrey Maturin series by Patrick O&#039;Brian, and Dr. Maturin in the series is a laudanum addict. Seeing as how the series takes place at the beginning of the 19th Century, I never thought in a million years I would ever get to try real laudanum that isn&#039;t modified to provide no euphoria, as most modern pharma concoctions are essentially castrated of all the fun stuff, but TSC makes the real stuff for you, and they even take into account your weight, height, and opiate tolerance to really personalize the service. <br /><br />They have done a great job keeping me informed and up to date on shipping and recommended method to use what they are sending me. This transaction could have gone very poorly, and in fact, on my second transaction with another vendor I got scammed, but the fact that TSC has provided me with such a positive experience, my silk road experience was not ruined. These guys have guaranteed a repeat customer in me, and you all can expect a detailed product review shortly for newbies as well. <br /><br />Best wishes!
