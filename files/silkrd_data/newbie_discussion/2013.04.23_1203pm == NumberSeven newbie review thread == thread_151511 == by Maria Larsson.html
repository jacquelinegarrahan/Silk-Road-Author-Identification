				Recieved a sample of 2x codeine pills + 1 bonus 100mg tramadol pill from NumberSeven.<br />Took 7 days to scandinavia from spain.<br />Commnunication with vendor was great and products seem to be of high quality.<br />Packaging was good with vac seal + inner concealing so product not visible on opening envelope.<br />His prices looks great and not many vendors in EU with same codeine without paracetamol so ill probably make a order when I get more coins.<br />&nbsp;

				I ordered a hash sample from NumberSeven and I&#039;ve gotta say it was the best hash I have tried in a long time, AAA++++ quality for sure ;D.<br />The packaging was super stealth and the shipment was fast and I even got a free sample on some excellent Speed too.<br /><br />5/5 !&nbsp; 8)

				I had a positive experience with NumberSeven.&nbsp; My order for Codeine came in without a hitch and I was given a couple surprise pills to go along with my order.&nbsp; This was completely unexpected and the first time I got a sample for something without having to ask for.&nbsp; All and all....a bit thumbs up!

				Finally also got to try numbersevens delicious hash. <br /><br />Excellent quality! <br /><br />The brown soft (at room temp when not dried) sticky hash gives a beautiful flowery cannabis smell. I have rareley tried stuff like it in Amsterdam, NL or Christiania, CPH, DK.<br /><br />Shared some puffs with fellow experienced smokers and everybody got impressed by its smell, taste and effects. Very little is needed for fine tasting joint giving great body &amp; mind high which worked great at last nights party.<br /><br />This is a must-have for collectors and connoiseurs and good priced alternative for EU ppl buying extracts/strong hash.<br /><br />5/5

				Ive checked through NumberSevens inventory and I gotta say it looks pretty strange. For instance he&#039;s got 3x30mg Methadone for 0.36BTC and 6x30mg Methadone for 0.42BTC.&nbsp; And his 3x20mg Oxynorm costs 0.29BTC but his 10x20 costs 1.33BTC. So it gets more expensive if you buy a bigger order then buying several smaller orders.. which doesnt make much sense to me. It should be the other way around. <br /><br />Ive browsed through his feedback and around 95% of them it says FE. So there&#039;s basically no feedback to go on. And the fact that he requires FE for all orders is also very strange. He blames the volatile BTC market but if he would just use hedging there wouldnt be any problem. Pretty poor excuse imo. <br /><br />I see a lot of warning signs with this vendor. He might be legit tho, I have no idea. But I would advise to be cautious here.

				i made an order with this vendor which arrived yesterday. it was a 100ug fentanyl patch.<br />it was requested that i FE, which i figure was because im relatively new to the site but it was no problem, package arrived in australia in about 7 bus. days which i was happy with, stealth was good there was a second envelope inside the one it came in with a poem type thing on it, which if i had seen i wouldve thought it was legit, looked like a letter to a boyfriend/girlfriend sorta thing.. communication was excellent the whole way, only thing is their english isnt the best although it didnt matter. i recommend this seller and will be going back

				just got a message from number7...where did I get the nerve to question finalizing early.<br />FE is a way to scam people...if you FE you will not be protected and you be in the hands of the vendor.<br />WHY DOES HE WANT YOU TO FE? SO HIS MONEY IS SAFE...FUCK YOU, HE GET HIS MONEY.<br />SR admins cannot do anything for you when he does not send the order...you already paid him.<br />STAY IN ESCROW, IT IS THERE FOR A REASON...TO PROTECT YOU !!!!

				I have purchased from number5 originally, and now number7 about 4 times, always in small amounts that I wouldn&#039;t be too distraught about losing the money for because of the FE requirement.&nbsp; He is one of the few vendors I am, at this point, comfortable doing this with.&nbsp; His packages have never taken longer than 10 days (and as few as 5) to reach the US, and out of the four orders never one problem.&nbsp; I am confident that if there was an issue number7 would make it right.

				I&#039;d like to followup and say that my 5th order with number seven came as expected.&nbsp; This guy couldn&#039;t be further from a scammer.&nbsp; There was a delay with my package, I believe it got checked by customs, and shipping time took longer than I was expecting.&nbsp; When I messaged number seven expressing my concern he got back to me in less than 24 hours and then went out of his way to follow up with me every two or three days until my package arrived.&nbsp; I felt like he was at least as concerned as me,maybe even more so, that&nbsp; my package arrived safe and sound.

				i&#039;m new to SR and my first order was with NumberSeven. I had to FE because i&#039;m new with 0 orders, and had no problem doing so after speaking with him via private messages. He sounds like a great guy. And this was a great experience! hope everyone on here is like him.&nbsp; i got my order within 48hours! really fast! and he threw in some nice freebies. Well happy my first order was a good experience. And with the freebies a real cheap deal. Thanks NumberSeven!!! I will post soon with details on how good his mec4, methylone and pills are.<br /><br />///////<br /><br />Para los españoles, este tipo es de fiar. He hablado con él por mensajes privados y perece muy leal. Le comenté que quería material para san juan y se encargo de mí muy bien! Envío super rápido y me hizo unos regalitos de puta madre. Fue mi primera compra en SR, y ha sido genial gracias a NumberSeven. Despues de San Juan ya vuelvo y comento que tal el cristal y las pastillas que le pille. Pero tienen una pinta que flipas.

				#7 is definitely a legitimate vendor. I ordered from him when I had little to no orders, so of course he is cautious and wants brand new buyers to FE. It was a small order so I didn&#039;t mind, and it did show up as promised. There unfortunately are other vendors on the road that create new accounts, order small amounts, and then leave negative feedback to undermine their competition. So any vendor will be wary of new buyers with 0 previous orders. But regardless, he does ship all orders as promised, not a scammer, completely legit and reliable. I had a good experience dealing with #7, and would order form him again...<br />

				Just one more comment about another post - nobody can &quot;force&quot; a buyer to FE. A vendor can state the terms of the sale, which may require you to FE, and the buyer can choose to accept this, or try a different vendor instead. I wouldn&#039;t have FE&#039;d if I had good stats with lots of purchases at that time, but when you are brand new to the road, you just have to use common sense and research the vendor, and then decide if you want to go ahead with a small order. That&#039;s what I did and ended up having a good experience with #7. I wouldn&#039;t FE now though, and I doubt many vendors would ask...<br />

				No.7 in my opinion is a first class vendor. Comms , stealth and delivery are second to none , sure he&#039;s had some troubles lately but it certainly didn&#039;t affect our transaction. <br />I ordered some of the hash and not only is it a quality product he was more than generous into the bargain. <br />Thanks No.7 hope to do business with you again soon.

				Definitely a legit vendor!<br /><br />I recently received a nice little letter from NumberSeven about 12 days from ordering some of his hash from mexican seeds. Weight was spot on, and the hash could be taken out from its hiding place after 5 minutes in the freezer. Don&#039;t try without, cause it is very soft and sticky at room temperature, and will stick to the vacuum bag it is in.<br /><br />The hash is really oily and soft, smells really nice and bubbles when near a flame. It is a premium class product at a good price. The only downside, if you can call it that, I had with this deal. Is the long time in transit, but that is due to me living in the other end of Europe from N7. So that&#039;s what you can expect.<br /><br />I will be back, cheers!&nbsp; :)
