				So I will be visiting my mate in another city soon and will be bringing some coke with me. I have a change over at York train station and I&#039;m a bit concerned as it is one of the main ones in the country. What are the chances of there being sniffer dogs and me getting busted ? I really need to put my mind at ease about this.

				I don&#039;t know much about the UK but I would have thought you&#039;d be fine. Public transport is one of the safest way of transporting goods.

				It happens for sure.<br />Euston later in the evening I&#039;ve seen it happen.<br /><br />It&#039;s also a pretty rare event as Police don&#039;t have the resources.<br /><br />Stick it in your pants/boxers you&#039;d need to be detained for a strip search for them to want to look at your willy.

				A tip for transporting safely is to use MBB bags, heat sealed.<br /><br />It&#039;s a standard for my dispatch on all products, and allows for effective sealing against dog detection.<br /><br />Alternate (if you don&#039;t have resources for a sealing unit and access to these bags) is to seek our &quot;smell proof&quot; bags - so-called bear proof or branded &quot;smelly proof&quot;....these are often sold at head shops and very reasonably priced. They are virtually undetectable in trial tests too...not so good for my business as stealth requires flat, seamless packaging....BUT for a one off, travelling idea...I think they will give you much needed security and concealment.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)<br /><br />Doc

				As other people on this thread have said, just conceal the coke in a decent place, don&#039;t look to shifty and be confident in your body language, and as a final sort of thing put the product in appropriate packet&#039;s for example DrCol mentioned bear bags &amp; smelly proof bags. All of these things should be utilized and you&#039;ll be fine. Just get in and out nice and quick without drawing to much attention, good luck bud!<br /><br />PlanB 8)

				A few weeks ago I crossed borders with a gram of mdma in my pocket!! i was fingerdippin it and i got up on the wrong train.<br /><br />Just stay cool and noone will bother you. read, browse on your phone, eat or look busy. the leo will not approach if you don&#039;t look suspicions. <br />this happens all teh time to me.<br />Today a search dog and five pigs stood next to me on the train. I had white (ketamine) under my nose. Noone gave a fuck.I was busy eating my sandwich. and I was not paranoid at all. Leo are people like everyone. and dumb as fuck like everyone.&nbsp; <br />the dogs are smarter. tho. be careful with them.<br />and dont make eye contact with anyone.

				if you&#039;re really worried you could always stash it somewhere on the platform before you get off the train, walk through the station, then go back to the platform and get your gear.<br /><br />i&#039;d suggest getting the coach tho, like they said its cheaper and they usually stop at designated bus stops on the outskirts of a lot of towns. they&#039;re not gonna have drug dogs waiting there just for 1 or 2 people that might get off.

				As has already been said, how you appear is paramount. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen dogs in stations before, only people they stopped were obviously stoners, I walked through fine. <br />

				hi, UK here also. For the last two years or so, I&#039;ve been going through a major airport to use transport links at least once a week with a 1/4oz of herb on me, as well as MDMA. So far, through amazing luck or divine blessing, I&#039;ve yet to be stopped by the police, or even seen sniffer dogs, regardless of my obvious pothead appearance. so based on my experience, you should be alright.<br /><br />Of course next time I try this I&#039;m going to get swarmed by a laughably high number of crafty canines and their jolly handlers :P <br /><br />Good luck

				Same. Dress nicely, act normal. Maybe I&#039;ve been lucky but I&#039;ve never had any problem.
