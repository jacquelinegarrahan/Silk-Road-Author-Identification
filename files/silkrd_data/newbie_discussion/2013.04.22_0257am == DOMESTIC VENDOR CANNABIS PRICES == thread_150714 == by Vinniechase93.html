				They are high but you also have to account for shipping, convenience, time, everything. I&#039;m sure for most vendors they have street consumers and SR consumers. Sell bulk weight to street guys they know and trust and sell the leftovers on SR at upped rates for extra cash. I mean where else can you go a request pounds of weed without knowing someone personally or getting shot?

				It is a bit more expensive on SR but if you go to the right venders,<br />for me its worth it for a few reasons,<br /><br />1. One is I get sick of lazy dealers IRL unreliable etc<br />2. I know what I am getting here and what I order is always bone dry.<br />3. I can order shit while I take a shit.<br />4. The amount of choice is awesome.<br /><br />Plus once you have been here a while you find good deals popping up<br />from time to time.<br /><br />

NO OFFENSE bro! It&#039;s just that I can get that price for indoor locally. Legal grows are an hour away from me, but I&#039;m STILL getting raped by middlemen!<br />&nbsp;your prices are very fair and there is $ to be made working with you, just not with me :(&nbsp; If there was a cheaper price for a steady bulk customer, I might be interested..but if you don&#039;t do outdoor you probably cant afford to go any cheaper...I get it :)<br />I came to SR looking for small amounts of molly once in awhile, then the forums got me LOL. How can I help NOT looking for someone who can give my regular guy(s) some healthy competition. Indoor is expensive to grow and I now know how much SR takes as well, so I figured at least the Cali people here could hook me up with some nice outdoor for cheaper than what I&#039;m paying. When I first got to SR a few months ago, there was &lt;$2500 outdoor everywhere. I was too worried about buying weed by mail to pull the trigger on anything until I did lots of research. Then the BTC bubble, then NOT being able to BUY BTCs, then gettin burned by bitinstant etc. <br />So I went back to lurking, found a new vendor, tried in vain to work with HIM and I just kept missing..even had his items in my CART, went to purchase some BTCs locally and in one hour my cart had been emptied and he had sold out grrr<br />I have since found ONE person who fits the bill and I will be receiving my package shortly. (I did find a few who said it&#039;s planting season right now but soon they will&nbsp; be able to accommodate me<br />I will update thoroughly, and Kensho..from what I see you are doing everything right, just keep on doing what yer doing and the buyers WILL find you. And if you know anyone whos got that killer outdoor for cheap, please let me know ;)<br />Thanks<br />~PB2k

				You might already have seen them but a newish vendor worth looking into is theDANKBANK, I&#039;m considering using them for my next bulk order. $1,500 for a lb of outdoor is pretty good, plus the reviews so far seem very positive. Here&#039;s they&#039;re page if your interested http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b16d796e75

				If your on the west coast then go and get some locally. You will get stuff for cheaper than on Silk Road. But there is some bomb-ass bud on here that I can&#039;t find locally. I also live in an area where there is no medical in sight and you pay the same as what you do on here for a hookup. There are some deals on here you just have to keep looking for the right people and be willing to take a chance on new vendors that sell at a discount. New vendors need that good rep. and it can be hard to find buyers when you start.
