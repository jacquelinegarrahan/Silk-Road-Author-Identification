				YingY I&#039;ve seen just about every kind of topic posted on here so far ranging from begging for .01 btc to naming your penis with the name of a movie. Lol. That being said i still feel like this question might be a little bit taboo even for these kind of forums. It&#039;s day 4 without benzo&#039;s and i feel like i have a mild case of the flu. I&#039;ve been through opiate wd&#039;s in the past, but that was from being on them regularly for a couple of years. I&#039;ve only been taking between 2mgs to 12mgs of benzos a day for 2 months! Wtf! If you&#039;re reading this still, i&#039;m not trying to complain or be overly dramatic. I&#039;m just wondering if it&#039;s possibly withdrawal symptoms i&#039;m having from not having anything for the last 4 days like i said. Anyways, i got a small order of xannies coming here in the next day or two, so it should be all good then. If anyone has experience or personal knowledge of this please let me know. Thank you.

				Hell yes, full blown withdrawal. If I were you, I&#039;d taper off....... Be careful, benzo withdrawal is hell.

				You can certainly get withdrawl from that much over that time.<br /><br />Do not go cold turkey on benzos, it can cause seizures. There is some good advice on erowid about weaning off. Valium is best for weaning off xanax because it has a cross tolerance, a long half-life and is more easily divided into small doses.<br /><br />A good rule of thumb is always go at least 3 days in a row without it each week if you want to avoid dependance. If you manage your intake then you should not need more than 2mg, needing more is a sign of tolerance.

				If it was daily use for two months straight....then hell yes.&nbsp; Please taper, DO NOT cold turkey.&nbsp; &nbsp;A doctor will even help you out with an RX for tapering...nobody wants to see you spaz out in full seizure mode.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be shy to seek medical attention, benzo withdrawal syndrome is very serious.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				As I understand it, 2 months on benzos is enough to cause permanent changes to the brain. <br />Even after a few days of use I notice mild withdrawal symptoms.<br />

				You will be in withdrawals and at risk of a grand mal seizure (fatal). Alcohol will do if you can&#039;t get any Benzos. After a week clean, start taking the supplement GABA. You will likely be failing drug tests for Benxos for a hot minute too...<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love (and good luck),<br />~f.xy

				Part of benzo safety is always keeping enough valium to be able to taper off over the course of several weeks. When you run out this should be the last stuff you touch and you should ration it so that you never end up without. Many drugs have unpleasant withdrawls, but with xanax it can be fatal.

				Yes.<br /><br />Two drugs can kill you in withdrawal, alcohol and benzos.<br /><br /><br />Go to a doctor, get help in tapering off.

That&#039;s why I brought up the alcohol. I was an alcoholic at the age of 19... 12 Natty Ices 5.9% (highest allowed by state) to keep the shakes away, 24 to have fun, 36 to get drunk. I also took 4.5mg of Rx&#039;ed Klonopin. And, liquor was always around and enjoyed. I had a &quot;moment of clarity&quot; at work in the bathroom ante-chamber.... I called my mom, admitted I was drinking alcoholically, and had been. She offered rehab. I turned it down, just said I would be in my room for three days and asked for water and a check-in occasionally. I took three or four days off work. I quit cold-turkey (honestly, it was one of my &quot;rolls of the dice&quot;... I see if the Reaper is ready for me or not...) and it was hell. I just lay in bed, I sweated, I hallucinated, I shook. I don&#039;t remember much... I just remember the hallucinations were so real. People came over, but I know they didn&#039;t.<br /><br />I smoked weed, took opiates, and other than a single Corona after a week clean, I stayed clean for two months (?). Then, I started again. Such is life. Haha. GABAaergic chemicals are no joke though.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love (and again, good luck and positive vibes),<br />~f.xy

You will get a far more favorable response than&nbsp; you would if you were asking to get off opiates.<br />I know it sounds odd but it happens to be true, I had a friend with the same problem
