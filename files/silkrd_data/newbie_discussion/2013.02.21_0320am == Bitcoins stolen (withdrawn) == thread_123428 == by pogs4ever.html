				I&#039;m new to this and I&#039;m sure I messed up somehow for this to happen. My bitcoins were &quot;withdrawn&quot; only leaving me with .01 bitcoin. I don&#039;t know what to do about this. I doubt I can get them back, but I sent a message to SR support to see what they advised me to do. I am assuming that I need to create a new silkroad acct, new ewallet acct, and new tormail. What advice can anyone give me? Thanks.

				Are you saying somebody got into your SR account and withdrew them?&nbsp; Did you check your account history?

				hey,<br />sorry to hear this has happened-well.options for this are limited.<br />---somebody somehow got your password and pin to withdraw.<br />---you&#039;ve made a calculation mistake.<br />---you&#039;re talking poopoo.<br />I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re talking poopoo,but unless your password is 111111 and your pin is 111111 then you&#039;ve given it to someone,told someone or you&#039;re being traced by a huge badass such as the DEA or whatever country you&#039;re in!<br />You really need to check your account history and such because if it is genuine theft then I&#039;d go for a new account :D<br /><br />

				Just something for others to be aware of:<br /><br />When you&#039;re making a withdrawal, check the address that you paste matches the one that you copied.<br />Why?<br /><br />Because certain enterprising fellows have made viruses that detect the presence of a valid bitcoin address in the windows clipboard and change it to some pre-programmed address they control.<br />Apparently they&#039;ve done rather well out of it too...
