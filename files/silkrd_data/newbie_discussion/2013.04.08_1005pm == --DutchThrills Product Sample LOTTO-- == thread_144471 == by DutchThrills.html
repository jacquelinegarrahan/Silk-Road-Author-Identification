				True to our word on our review thread here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=144423.0<br />The DutchThrills Product Sample Lotto is LIVE!<br />Tickets are 0.01 (unable to make it totally free but all other costs will be covered by us) and 5 winners will be selected at random.<br />Anyone can enter no matter stats or location and you may buy as many tickets as you wish to increase chances of winning but each win can only sample one product and each winner only one sample of any one product, so if you win twice you cant get two samples of No.4 etc.<br />All details can be found here along with tickets: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5974e65ed6<br />Good luck to everyone and winners will be announced here after messages are sent out. We ask each winner post a review here and on our review thread to verify our product arrived safely and any comments they have.<br />-D.T.-

				Hi DT, you can actually making it cheaper by hedging the prices to the dollar and putting it at $0.00 So how exactly does your lottery work? Usually it&#039;s something like.. You win if your transaction number ends with X but how do you find the winner??
