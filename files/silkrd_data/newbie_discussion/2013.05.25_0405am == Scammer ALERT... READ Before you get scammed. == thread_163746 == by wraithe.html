				Tip for Newbies NEVER FE.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you FE and get scammed, SR cannot help you.&nbsp; If a vendor is asking you to FE I ask that you post in this forum below so the community can look into it<br /><br />FE = Finalizing Early,&nbsp; You should only Finalize when you receive the product.&nbsp; SCam Vendors will offer you free shipping, discount, or more product. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS!<br /><br />Report any suspicious vendors to SR using the REPORT VENDOR, it also helps to alert the community below is a thread I have for exposing potential scams.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=162720.0

				I should mention I had to FE with a trusted vendor because I had no stats... Bad idea? He was concerned because other vendors were coming on SR posing as buyers with intentions to leave bad feedback.<br /><br />He seems incredibly legit.

				trusted vendors in the past have turned scammer.&nbsp; When you FE, you take that risk.&nbsp; Are you gonna get scammed for FEing for a trusted vendor? likely no, but in the event you do you lost all Resolution Options with SR.<br /><br />Majority of the time if you are a new buyer, you will find a vendor not requiring FE with no/low stats.&nbsp; If you cannot then make sure your FE amount is low and you can afford to lose it.<br /><br />I can list some &quot;trusted&quot; vendors that required any US order to FE, then they disappeared.&nbsp; Could be in jail who knows, but if you FEd and they didnt send the pack yet and something happens to them.&nbsp; You do not get your money back.

				I understand, and a good post I might add. <br /><br />I did not spend to much on the purchase, but I should also have said I spent 3 days researching all I could about SR and the hows and how nots. I even mentioned to the vendor that I did not want to FE because it was highly advised not to due to scamming. He insisted if I did not trust him to make 5 purchases before dealing with him so I would not have to FE. This particular vendor had (100) stats and had no bad reviews for 5 months straight. So I trusted him. <br /><br />If I get nothing then it was my stupidity and will report it.

				starting out its a risk you have to weigh out.&nbsp; I am sure youll be ok but it doesnt take a lot to get 5 transactions of small items or lotteries or coupon packs etc.&nbsp; a lot of people use those as stat boosters.
