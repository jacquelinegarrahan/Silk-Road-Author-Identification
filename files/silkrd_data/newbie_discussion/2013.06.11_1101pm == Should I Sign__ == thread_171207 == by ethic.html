				Hello SR,<br /><br />I previously bought 25 ecstasy tablets from SuperTrips about two weeks ago. It finally arrived in my P.O. Box today in a form of a slip to sign and pick it up in the front of the office. Now I know the general rule of Silk Road is to never sign for anything, so I just left with the slip in hand. I&#039;ve been going through SuperTrip&#039;s reviews and all have been really well. There are a few stating that they had to sign for their packages, but weren&#039;t a controlled delivery.<br /><br />Also, my dumbass overread this part on SuperTrip&#039;s profile:<br />&quot;You may have to sign, I cannot guarantee anything regarding signatures, you may likely have to sign! Be sure to use your own name and address in the address box which is FINAL! This also goes for Germans who have pulled too many scams. Einschreiben may be used. If you are not okay with this, please do not order from me, as you will not receive any form of compensation if you are not willing to accept a package without signing, or not willing to accept if you have to sign, or not willing to retrieve from post office with a signature. &quot;<br /><br />I know that ST is a reliable vendor, just trying to get some input from anyone with similar experience or people who&#039;ve dealt with buying from ST. Any help would be great, thanks!<br /><br />P.S. I use a P.O. Box because I still live at home with my parents and I don&#039;t want them to get involved in any SR business. Also because they like to look through my mail.

				It&#039;s up to you.&nbsp; 25 MDMA pills is definitely enough for a CD.&nbsp; Personally, I would sign but that&#039;s just me.

				I (in Canada) signed for ST. No problem.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t you sign for a random package that showed up? I have 40-50 legitimate orders on the go at any time, so whatever. I never know what will show up<br /><br />Just make sure your place is fucking clean. No drugs, no paraphernalia, no recorded passwords/accounts/history, nothing.
