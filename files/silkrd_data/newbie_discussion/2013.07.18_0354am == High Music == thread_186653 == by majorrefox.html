				High or sober, I absolutely love a good guitar solo. (See my post above) I like this question though, so I&#039;ll go into more detail.<br />Generally, I feel like I can enjoy just about any music that I can tell has been made with genuine emotion. Whether it is rock, rap, country, electronic, or classical, I think you can tell the strength of the emotion behind the music, and that helps make a song better.<br />With weed, just about any quality music will please me, so I try to be diverse, but tripping is a different story. When I&#039;m tripping, music can be everything, so I try to choose wisely. Some of the music that I enjoy sober and on bud is not so enjoyable while tripping, and vice/versa. <br />I like to listen to concept albums and other albums that have been put together to be a whole experience rather than individual songs. The epitome of the concept album is Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd, and it is one of my favorite albums to trip with. When your entire consciousness is spinning around you, you can let the music take control. Dark Side of the Moon will take you on a sonic journey through yourself, society, and the universe, and deliver you safe to the other side. Pink Floyd knew how to make an aural adventure, but they are certainly not the only band capable of such musical mastery.<br />Jimi Hendrix can do magic with his guitar, especially if the listener is flying high. With any of his 3 albums (Are You Experienced?, Axis: Bold as Love, Electric Ladyland), new details emerge and hidden secrets become clear when listening to them on psychedelics. Jimi liked acid, and when you listen to Jimi on acid on acid, you can feel what he wants you to feel; you can follow him down a most magical rabbit hole.<br /><br />I was going to write more about other music and stuff, but thinking about Jimi wore me out. It&#039;s so good.

				If I&#039;m just looking to chill out, I dig either liquid or minimal drum and bass. Stuff like Alix Perez, Spectrasoul, etc. If it&#039;s more a dancing high, some ghetto funk, some more synth-ey DnB, Dirtybird-esque house, glitch hop... I usually stick to electronic when I am high I find.<br /><br />Though Hendrix is definitely not a bad alternative. I do love me some guitar solos from time to time!

				Some good quality orchestral performances on decent headphones when I&#039;m stoned out of my mind literally blows my socks off man I can imagine all kinds of crazy shit listening to that. Also really complex drum&#039;n&#039;bass etc is always fun. The best thing though is jamming on some simple string instruments or keyboard or something. Even just mad nonsense playing bongos or something is pretty fun.

				I mostly listen to EDM, only the BPM changes with different substances. For having a smoke on some sweet bud, I like listening to The Happy Mondays, Leftfield, Depeche Mode, Orbital, KLF &amp; SLF. When rolling on some good MDMA, I dig out my old Essential Mixes from the 90&#039;s, Pete Tong, Oakie, PVD, or the like &amp; preferably a live recording from a club with very vocal &amp; noisy clubbers heard in the back ground, use your imagination as to why that might be, lol! The only exception to the EDM rule is when tripping on LSD, this is where Coldplay, The Kings Of Leon, &amp; Snow Patrol come in. I particularly like the track &#039;Chasing Cars&#039; when tripping,&nbsp; I can feel the emotion Gary Lightbody is injecting into the track &amp; for me it&#039;s an enlightening experience. I will admit though, that my 1st ever LSD experience came at a Snow Patrol concert, &amp; the aforementioned track was playing when I was really feeling the effects, so this could be a personally bias opinion! <br /><br />Peace.

				Have to admit to having a soft spot for the vocal trance meself, though mostly oldskool stuff.&nbsp; Some of my favorite all time vocal trancers would include ; Rollo Goes Mystic - Love, Love, Love,&nbsp; Way Out West - Mind Circus (Gabriel &amp; Dresden Remix), Lange Featuring Leah - Don&#039;t Think It (Feel It), 4 Strings - Take Me Away (Into The Night), Unique 2 - Loveline &amp; Markus Schulz - You Won&#039;t See Me Cry (Deepsky Remix). Now that I&#039;m thinking about it, that list could extend to a couple of pages, lol!!

				I have to confess to not being able to relate to the current style of trance, vocal or otherwise. I&#039;ve tried to listen to a lot of the new stuff from the likes of ; Dash Berlin (sorry Silvia777000!), Betsie Larkin, Supertab &amp; 8, Cosmic Gate &amp; Emma Hewitt, Orjan Nilsen &amp; (SADLY) Paul Oakenfold, etc....
