				Hey mate, I placed my order on thursday &amp; used the express shipping option. <br /><br />I am in the same boat...<br /><br />No replies.<br /><br />Not marked in transit.<br /><br />After 4 days you have the option to cancel...<br /><br />That day is today for me, I will be cancelling.

				Cool thank you. It was the same deal with me they were messaging me and then bam right after I order. They won&#039;t read my messages and they told me I would have my pack on Saturday like they did for me last week that&#039;s why I picked them again.

				I purchased from them right before the DDoS attack.&nbsp; They processed my order during the outage and I received it in like 3 business days.&nbsp; Maybe they bailed after that though?

				Anyone know if when we cancel we&#039;ll get back the same price of bitcoins (so less money) as before, or if the system takes into account price fluctuation in BTC? Thanks!
