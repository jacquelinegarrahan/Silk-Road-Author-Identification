				I am not such a valued forum member, but I have been posting a lot lately and really grown a liking to this community<br /><br />I AM a valued SR customer. Been a member for over 2 years, have well over 10 transactions. Never refunded, only auto finalized once (I was too new to the escrow system) and spend close to a thousand on the road.<br /><br />I also have a lot of experience with various psychedelics, including DMT, LSD, MDMA, shrooms, certain NBOMEs and a few others I can compare to.<br /><br />and if you want to test shipping to Israel I&#039;ll be there in 2 weeks (where I usually live). Otherwise I&#039;m in the US for now if you want to try shipping here. <br /><br />I should be at 50 posts and able to post in your review thread and discussion in no time.

				Hello friend I have experience with all different kinds of DMT and I would like to try your sample and then give it an honest review. I have left forum reviews for other vendors before and you can see I have been on this site for about two years now. Thanks and good luck I hope you do well here.

				I am not a seasoned buyer, however I do have closer to 300 forum posts and good karma. Pretty please let me slip by? I haven&#039;t done DMT in the longest, have a festie coming up and it would really make my day! Last time I did DMT was at a Rainbow gathering, years back. I am a seasoned psychonaut if that means anything. I have guided many through their first trips and have done any and all psychedelics, other than maybe ayahausca. Pretty pleeeease? &lt;3<br /><br />I am adding to cart now. My SR name starts with a b and ends with a r, two words, (BW). Absolutely LOVE Alex Grey by the way. Been wanting to visit his Chapel in NYC some day.... <br /><br />Please don&#039;t cancel on me! Either way, +1 for sampling such a divine product.

Yeah the festie is a couple weeks away, I understand you&#039;d want a trip report ASAP. Well I do live right outside a nice wooded area, I can dose up and make a trip out there. I am a reputable forum member, you will see me here every day. If you don&#039;t cancel on me, I will do it as soon as I receive it rather than waiting and write out a fantastic trip report.

				Placed an order! Excited to try it and return with a review :D<br /><br />First time trying freebase dmt, have some experience with changa in the past. <br /><br />Now for the freebase, I have both a freebase pipe and some vape pens mostly micro g pens, what would be the better option to vape the dmt? Freebase pipe or vape pen? I will likely try the freebase pipe first hopefully with some success. Last time I used a freebase pipe was for 5-meo-dmt but with little success. <br /><br />Thanks all and much love!
