				i have just officially registered a a new SR vendor a few days ago. I specialize in all kinds of injectables and orals products to enhance athletic performance (PEDs).<br /><br />I am the laboratory owner and hence i can provide SR with the best prices and quality product on the market. our chemists use 99% pure raws and pharma-grade solvents. Also, all our products actually have 10 to 20% more hormone powder than what&#039;s described on the label. This gear runs on the streets for about 80-100$ a vial/bottle in my municipality, and they&#039;re all on sale on SR for 30 to 60 USD depending on the compound.<br /><br />Laboratory is based on the eastern coast of canada, and gear arrival is guaranteed for Canada and USA.<br /><br />i am also a steroid cycles expert, so don&#039;t be afraid of asking me any cycle-related question.<br /><br />the link to my profile page:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/8456c7765d<br /><br />here is a link a customer of mine posted in order to be as transparent as possible about the 250$ order he just passed:<br /><br />Here is the thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161038.0<br /><br />hopefully i can bring something new and useful to this community.

				Hi guys.&nbsp; Im the customer that Montfort mentioned.&nbsp; Three letters for it are definitely GTG.<br /><br />Here is a c/p of my review from my thread to save some effort for you guys.<br /><br />I got the package this morning.&nbsp; Well wrapped no rattling, and decent stealth considering the product.&nbsp; These arent powders so it isn&#039;t as easy to hide.&nbsp; Montfort was on top of communication.&nbsp; Prompt messages tracking delivered even though I said it wasn&#039;t needed and exceedingly polite.&nbsp; He has been a true professional and its been a pleasure to deal with him so far.<br /><br />He went above and beyond with this one.&nbsp; I was expecting a sample but he offered to ship the whole cycle and let me pay on arrival.&nbsp; I was a little apprehensive about going into escrow with a new vendor considering it could come out as a 50% refund.&nbsp; He took the risk and I think that says a lot about his dedication to being a good vendor.&nbsp; Total order is test cyp, nolva, hcg, and the d-bol sampler.&nbsp; All told this is about as cheap as I have paid for gear on the webz.<br /><br />The gear is definitely GTG and pro.&nbsp; Clean pressed tabs.&nbsp; The labels are all straight.&nbsp; Vials are spotless, and the gear is nice and clear throughout.&nbsp; I weighed the vials quick to make sure the contents were the same, and they were all perfect.&nbsp; Different levels and loose pills are a bad sign for me in gear Im putting into my body.&nbsp; This is the exact opposite: Lab grade and a great attention to detail.&nbsp; I doubt this was made dirty in a kitchen and montfort refer to themselves as chemists not cooks.&nbsp; Always a good sign in my experience.&nbsp; I cant speak to quality beyond that but I have no worries about it going into my body so I think that speaks for itself.<br /><br />Again the stealth was decent but not spectacular.&nbsp; Im sure this is something that will be improved over time.&nbsp; Newer vendors arent always used to the high expectations of the SR community.&nbsp; The package got here without a problem so that speaks for itself.<br /><br />Shipping time?&nbsp; Exceptional.&nbsp; This would have been a 2 day transaction if it didnt happen over a long weekend.&nbsp; I live in the same general area and express post is lightning fast for regional.&nbsp; If every vendor had a 2 day turnaround I would be a happy happy customer.&nbsp; Tracking was promptly and politely sent.&nbsp; What more could I ask for?<br /><br />Im one happy customer and now Im scrambling to get him the bitcoins he deserves for this one.&nbsp; I wasnt planning on ordering right away but Montfort seemed like good people and worth taking a chance with.&nbsp; I would be happy to place an order that stays in escrow with him anytime.<br /><br />Ill try to post some pics a bit later.&nbsp; Its pretty much as expected so I dont know if its even needed.&nbsp; I will update when the gear kicks in.&nbsp; I have heard of the lab second hand so I am optimistic about this.&nbsp; My friend told me he paid $100 a vial for some T400 from this lab.&nbsp; Good to go were his words so I have some confidence at least.&nbsp; Cautious but confident.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions feel free to ask and I will do what I can to answer my side.&nbsp; In my opinion Montfort is GTG and definitely going to be a good vendor for the future.<br /><br />Thanks Montfort.&nbsp; I appreciate your confidence in taking all the risks on this one.<br /><br />
