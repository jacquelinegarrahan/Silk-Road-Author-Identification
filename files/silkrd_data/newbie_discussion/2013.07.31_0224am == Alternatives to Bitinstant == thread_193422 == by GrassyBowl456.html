				Can anyone suggest any decent alternatives to Bitinstant since its been down? It&#039;s the only method I&#039;ve used to buy bitcoin, the rest just seemed like giant headaches. Or were just lengthy ass procedures. I&#039;m in the US if that matters at all. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. THANKS.<br /><br />Also, anyone have any experience with coinbase? <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t mean to be a dick but would a simple google search not answer this? I&#039;m sure there&#039;s loads.. I&#039;m from the other side of the world so I can&#039;t help you but I&#039;ve heard people say they can buy from mtgox or something ?

				Cash deposit at a local bank using escrow on localbitcoins.com.&nbsp; Had Btc 3 mins after deposit. I used This dude.&nbsp; https://localbitcoins.com/ad/15776/purchase-bitcoin-cash-deposit-boa-wells-fargo-citi-regions-united-states<br />He was professional and minutes to release coins.&nbsp; Bit instant is gonna have some problems this was easier, faster and more anonymous.&nbsp; There is no local humans selling near me.&nbsp;

				To help out newbs, I wrote up some methods for buying bitcoins and moving them to the Road. <br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

And what was safe and what wasn&#039;t.<br /><br />I ended up using coinbase and it&#039;s perfect for me.&nbsp; It&#039;s less safe so I use bitcoin fog in addition as the middleman for CB and SR. And the week lead time sucks.&nbsp; But it has like 1% or stupidly low fee compared to the 15-20% of BitInstant.
