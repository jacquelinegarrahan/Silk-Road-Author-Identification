				Let me first start by saying I&#039;ve been a member on here for a little over a year now, I&#039;ve contemplated writing this for a while, but came to the conclusion that by presenting the facts you guys can make up your own minds.<br /><br />When I started, like many of you, I was completely seduced by the sheer quantity and quality of whats available here on SR. Like a kid buying pick&#039;n&#039;mix, I got out my bag and started filling: a little of this, a little of that, legal/illegal I bought a sample of everything.<br /><br />At this point I should point out that in the past I have &quot;carded&quot; items online before. For those of you that don&#039;t know what that means: effectively buying goods with other peoples credit cards.<br /><br />Now, the problem came when I ordered some prescription medication, which for obvious reasons I dont have access to in my country. So I logged on, found a vendor in &quot;India&quot; and placed my order. 4 Weeks later a package arrived, no stealth, no effort, nothing. Simply an envelope with a box of pills thrown in and an invoice from a legitimate Indian company charged to someone in the US.<br /><br />I think nothing of it given the vendors VERY high feedback, so about a month later I ordered again, and then again. Each time the invoice is charged to different people, either in the US or UK.<br /><br />Eventually I realized this was exactly how I received items I had carded before from legitimate companies.<br /><br />It concerns me that many of these legal items, such as Nbomes, Prescription Medication is being bought on stolen credit card data. It concerns me the vendor puts their BUYERS in a position of complete vulnerability, not only will they be responsible for importing illegal substances, but also credit card fraud all of it being directly linked to their home.<br /><br />I was going to write this because I am unsure of ways to combat it, I guess the only way to ensure a vendor your dealing with is legitimate is by including a random message/logo.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, I would love to hear what you guys have to say.<br />Peace.Love.RocknRoll

You already chose to order illegal drugs, and didn&#039;t take precautions for your security. If you get caught for fraud, its no different. Especially since it seems like Karma has yet to catch up with you when you carried out the same activity yourself.

				Wow. Yeah I had to do a double take when I read this. It just baffles that these kind of scumbags can be so brazen about their scamming people,as if it&#039;s ok and everyone here on SR is just so cool about fucking people over. Like SR is all scumbags. No, you Trend* are a scumbag. Hopefully, you will realize your ways and change. I don&#039;t hate people like you as I just see you as a product of a bad upbringing and have come to believe that screwing everyone over is the way to be ahead of the pack. But this is just wrong. You are sick. Get help. You sound like a junkie. SR could not exist if it was made up of a bunch of swindlers and thieves. Most of the people on SR are upstanding chaps who just believe in freedom to explore the human psyche. We don&#039;t need <br />street trash gutter snipe like you Trend* to muck up a beautiful system. Now I am sorry for those harsh words. <br />Go into the woods alone for a month, with little food and water. Perhaps you will find who you are. Perhaps you will be confronted with truth. That you are a lie. That you have no scruples because you are not comfortable with your place in the universe. Start doing charitable works. There is hope for you, regardless of what others say. I do not believe in fighting hate with more hate. <br />The universe loves you just the way you are, you do not need to steal from it. Everything can be had by asking. If it is not given then it&#039;s not meant to be had. I hope you fix your illness now as the torment of eons of karmic guilt will be the worst hell ever. I&#039;d rather not hear your cries, as I have heard the souls of the damned many times too many. Be at peace. <br />Rest of SR, don&#039;t beat hard on this person with words of hate. Hate just breeds more hate. Pray that (s)he sees the light and receives redemption.<br />Cheers,<br />

				Idk if everyone is reading your post right or wrong either way I&#039;ll assume both. <br />1. you shouldn&#039;t have admitted you carded when your complaining about it (terrible idea). <br /><br />2. I don&#039;t like it either but all i can do is not buy from that vendor I wont complain its illegal and had to come from somewhere. <br /><br />3.

				I guess I add myself to the list of haters above me, for the following reasons:<br /><br />THIS IS UTTER NONSENSE<br /><br />What proof do you have against this? What if these are random corporations the vendor uses to launder his money? <br />What if, MOST LIKELY, this is a FAKE RECEIPT in case the package gets seized and YOU don&#039;t get screwed. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s some sort of conspiracy to rate a shitty vendor highly. <br />It&#039;s good that you point things like these out, but there&#039;s a way of saying things. And immediately throwing blame is not the correct way to go. There are several possible scenarios for this, and I believe that &#039;carding&#039; is the last possible one. Also, don&#039;t generalize and claim it&#039;s a &#039;growing&#039; trend. Wtf are you talking about?<br /><br />PS: I concur with everyone, you&#039;re a dick for carding other people&#039;s hard-earned money. I hope karma bites back.<br /><br />One love.

				So, what you&#039;re saying is that the vendors you buy from don&#039;t verify the information or at least spot inconsistencies (different credit cards used to ship to a single address)? Or are you saying that prescription medication requires a prescription, of which you have no furnished proof, but the supplier still delivers.<br /><br />I&#039;m a little confused, and I don&#039;t understand why &quot;including a random message/logo&quot; helps in proving legitimacy.<br /><br />Not judging here like the rest of the people here since you&#039;re being upfront and honest, though of course, morals are up to you to decide with and change when fit. Just wanting to understand what&#039;s going on.

				i think the point the op is getting at is that if this is happening to him, it is probably happening to any one of the rest of us. thankfully as a carder himself he has been able to identify this problem so maybe it can be sorted out. how would any of you feel if you bought from a seller, then not only had your items confiscated but got arrested and charged with credit card fraud? <br /><br />the guy is actually doing you all a favor and none of you self righteous bastards can see it, for the sake of putting him down in order to attempt to give yourself some credit and feel good about your smarmy selves. go fuck yourselves, you don&#039;t deserve the heads up that the op has given you. <br /><br />the guy robbed the banks who have been robbing us all for fucking years. give the guy a medal i say.<br /><br />to the poster who called him the lowest scum. he ain&#039;t murdered nobody, he ain&#039;t a pedo or rapist. i have a feeling some here have something they are secretly ashamed of and are jumping at the chance to feel better about themselves for a moment by cussing somebody else down. that is usually the case in my experience.<br /><br />rant over, you can all -1 me now motherfuckers.

Or are you saying that prescription medication requires a prescription, of which you have no furnished proof, but the supplier still delivers.<br /><br />I&#039;m a little confused, and I don&#039;t understand why &quot;including a random message/logo&quot; helps in proving legitimacy.<br /><br />Not judging here like the rest of the people here since you&#039;re being upfront and honest, though of course, morals are up to you to decide with and change when fit. Just wanting to understand what&#039;s going on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i think what the op thinks is going on is that the sr seller is getting an order for pills, but doesn&#039;t have any pills in his possession. the sr seller is then using CC info to order the pills fraudulently from another vendor online, but giving the sr buyers details so it is shipped straight to them(called drop shipping). i&#039;m guessing the idea is that the sr vendor gets required to put a card with some logo in his parcels to show he has shipped them himself instead of drop shipping them where he wouldn&#039;t get the opportunity to put a logo in the package as he would never touch or possess it<br /><br />if this was done to you and the parcel was intercepted, you could well find yourself in a position where the only way you could get out of a CC fraud charge would be to admit to attempting to buy drugs online. with it being an indian seller that would make you liable to a charge of attempting to import a controlled substance. you&#039;d be best to take the Cc fraud charge if anything. although technically if the order was made by the seller from a pharmacy in another country then the attempting to import charge could still apply on top of the CC fraud charge. difficult situation you&#039;d be in that&#039;s for sure.

				Ah got it. Thanks. Great explanation there. It&#039;s basically unauthorized dropshipping with leaking of secure info. Yuck.
