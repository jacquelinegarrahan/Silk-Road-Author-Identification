				I would say it is perfectly possible and reasonable, dependant on:<br />1) local prices in your country/area<br />2) SR prices<br />3) scale of the local operation<br /><br />The biggest issue I can see is that you are an unneccesary middleman, I don&#039;t think there would be enough profit for you if you were just selling to a street dealer, this would be dependant on all the factors above.<br />The most profit to be made would be if you were the street dealer!<br />

				That could be your problem, if you can you need to be cash up front with everyone and only let people pay you in a similar fashion, take for instance:<br />You have a very good trusting business relationship with your local dealer and let him have the goods on credit, this is all good for a while and then suddenly he gets robbed or caught by LE. He owes you for a Keys worth of goods. Can be a tricky situation.<br /><br />For me in my country/area, the SR prices on most goods wouldn&#039;t allow enough margin to be worth selling locally, although quality in many cases is better, in fact for many products you pay a premium here, however that premium is often worth it to me for the quality.<br /><br />Good luck if you decide to go for it!<br />

				Depends on the price you can get the product for, how much it will cost to package it effectively, and how much it will cost to keep you safe (and run your vendor account like business man).<br /><br />If the cost isn&#039;t worth it to you then don&#039;t bother. If it&#039;s kind of worth it, but not worth your time then don&#039;t bother. It&#039;s not all sunshine and pussy spitting rainbows, it&#039;s hard work to keep people happy.
