				I am going to be exchanging some USD for bitcoins from Blue Sky Traders because my research shows they are very reliable.<br /><br />In the process however, I have to email them telling them the amount of USD I am going to be depositing into their account (which will then be turned into BTC and placed into my silkroad account).<br /><br />Is it safe to use a regular yahoo email? or Should I email them with something else?<br />And yes I am aware that Blue Sky Traders is down until Aug 28th<br />Thank you in advance for your help/suggestions<br />

				If you are just a buyer than there is really no need to worry.. Only encrypt sensitive information that has to do with orders.. You should be fine to buy from a reputable BTC trader online, many people use BTC for perfectly benign purposes.. This is simply the most notorious and illegal of them.
