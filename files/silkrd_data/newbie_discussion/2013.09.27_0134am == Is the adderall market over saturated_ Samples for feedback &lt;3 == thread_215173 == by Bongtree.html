				Humm...Its kinda worrisome if people aren&#039;t buying.

That being said, If you liked my way of business would you come back, if after I was established I raised the price to $12-13/ea? <br /><br />Sorry for these questions, I just have a commodity that I dont need or like and dont want to blow the $500 or however much for the seller account, if I have doubts in my mind :/ <br /><br />Thanks for any imput&lt;3

But only because you&#039;re in the forums, I probably wouldn&#039;t buy from your vendor page because yeah, I probably would think you were scamming selling that low. I would totally risk buying a couple pills from you first and then I&#039;d increase my order. Used to have a script for Addies and now I&#039;m back in school and don&#039;t wanna go through the shit of getting my own script back. Me personally, I would buy from you for that price for a few and then yeah, if you only raised it a few dollars I&#039;m sure I&#039;d keep buying.<br /><br />Us forum readers are loyal feedback-ers. You could always give away one or two small (maybe 1-3 pill) samples here in the forums, we&#039;d leave great feedback, then you&#039;d have a start. That&#039;s how many new vendors start.<br /><br />P.S. If you do decide to do samples and I&#039;m not online at the time, please keep me in mind. I always miss out on samples and I fucking love Addies.

				Hi, They are generic I believe, I dont have insurance so Id imagine so. <br /><br />They are orange, oval : <br /><br />Imprints on them are <br /><br />2|0&nbsp; - on one side <br /><br /><br />b&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - on the other<br />973<br /><br />Im willing to do samples, provided you pay for shipping, It will be USPS priority BOX with tracking so Im asking 6.00 to cover the shipping. <br /><br />I think thats fair, considering. <br /><br />**If you would like to try me as a potential vendor please MESSAGE me on SR my user name is:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bongtree97<br /><br /><br />@gn0ssos- I pm&#039;ed you, but didnt hear back. Did you not want to try or change your mind? Just curious...<br /><br />ALSO!!! anyone who does PM me and gets samples...PLEASE PLEASE start a Forum topic on My service, shipping, communication, stealth, product, etc... and BE HONEST! Im not effing around here I want to start selling them and NEED people to give truthful feedback, good or bad so I can improve. <br /><br />Also please remember, I will try to log on EVERYDAY, but I do attend Nursing School and my days are LONG so If its been a few hours, please remember I have a life I have to lead :) Most if not all replies will be answered in 24 hrs.<br /><br />Thank you Silk Roadsters!

				Well, if they&#039;re cheap enough I&#039;d likely buy from you (since you posted here). I think most Adderall venders don&#039;t sell much because they&#039;re overpriced (around here they&#039;re $5-$10) street price.
