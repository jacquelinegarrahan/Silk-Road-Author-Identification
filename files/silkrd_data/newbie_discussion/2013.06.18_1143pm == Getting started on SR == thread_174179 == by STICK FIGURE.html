				Title: <strong>Getting started on SR</strong><br />

				So I recently joined SR due to my long time connect&#039;s recent retirement. He was the only one i could get 2 mg xanax sticks from in my area, and due to the high demand I have in 2 cities for these things, I decided I&#039;d cut out the middle man and try out the road. I&#039;ve got some general IT knowledge, but I&#039;m no professional hacker or encryption genius or anything. I&#039;ve found the vendors who I would like to contact, but I got some obstacles in my way before I can get started anything: <br /><br />1. PGP: I understand the concept of encrypting, and from browsing around I know PGP is a certain way to encrypt (right?). So do I need a PGP program to generate/decrypt keys? I don&#039;t want to message any vendors and sketch them out just because I may not be able to interpret their instructions. <br /><br />2.Bitcoins: I need a way to convert cash I got into BC, and from there get them into my SR account. Can i go buy a visa gift card or something and put it straight into my SR account, or do I need to convert my USD from said card or cash to BC and then add them to SR, and how would I do so? (This has been the most frustrating part for me, so I would REALLY REALLY appreciate a lot of advice in this area). <br /><br />3. Escrow: Escrow is a way to ensure you dont get completely scammed or something, right? How does this work? <br /><br />4. Any other things I should know before I start contacting vendors, depositing bitcoins, and encrypting? Call me a noob or whatever all you guys want, I&#039;m just trying to start making money again. <br /><br />I would appreciate to get all the help I could get here, I really look forward to the opportunities it can bring with helping me expand. <br /><br />-STICK FIGURE

				Welcome!<br /><br />1. Right, just look at the PGP stickied thread at the top. It&#039;s pretty basic. Just make your own keys and practice it first. You can use something like Kleopatra, or there are some websites that will do it (via Javascript so the data never leaves your computer).<br /><br />2. Fastest (but not cheapest) way is to get MoneyPak or Reloadit converted to BTC. There&#039;s vendors in the &#039;services&#039; section on SR. MoneyHoney is good and fast.<br /><br />3. Escrow is automatic; it happens when you buy on SR. Then you &#039;finalize&#039; after you&#039;re happy and that releases the funds to the vendor (or after about 17 days that will happen automatically, but don&#039;t wait that long. Just finalize when you receive the item).<br /><br />4. Yes, don&#039;t contact a vendor asking how to encrypt. See #1 above. Read the seller&#039;s product description and their vendor page carefully, some have certain ways they want the delivery address, stuff like that. A lot of vendors have every detail spelled out, so there is generally not much reason to msg them to ask questions beforehand. Some will require new buyers to FE, that&#039;s finalize early (see #3) above, to guarantee they get their money (sometimes new buyers claim they never received the item even when they did and then want a refund).

				Yes GPG is it, it&#039;s a package of tools including Kleopatra.<br /><br />Only thing with Kleopatra is it seems like you have to put your message into a text file and save it, then encrypt/decypt. It doesn&#039;t seem to have a way to just copy/paste the data right in the UI.

				Thanks for the help guys, I found a pgp encrypter/decrypter after a little bit of looking around. <br /><br />Only problem I&#039;m having though is finding a reputable, reliable source to get bitcoins from. A lot of them (such as bitamp and MTgox)&nbsp; require personal information, and as stated earlier, I want to be completely anonymous and untraceable. Will my information be secure with them, and if it is, will there be any issues security wise using that for SR?<br /><br />Once again appreciate all the help guys
