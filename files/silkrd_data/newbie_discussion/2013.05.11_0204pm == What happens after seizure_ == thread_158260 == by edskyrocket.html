				So I was wondering, If you sell drugs cross-country and customs seize your package, what happens next?<br />If your adress is on the letter, will this mean police come to your house and arrest you?<br />Or do you just get a warning or something?<br />

				It depends on the recipients country&#039;s, the amount and the type. I hope your not in some fucked country when it comes to this shit, .au and .us seem to be the worst in my opinion.

				Why would you put your address if you sell, that doesn&#039;t make any sense.. better protect your ass and send it as if it was coming from another adress. If it&#039;s lost, it&#039;s lost and if it&#039;s seized it&#039;s harder to get back to you...

				Rocket .... you had my ass on the floor laughing uncontrollably with that warning comment. No I don&#039;t think you would ever get a warning of any kind .... you need to a little research on drugs and what schedule they fall under different schedules require different penalties. Quantities would impact any possible time you&#039;ll spend in jail as well. The bottom line is ..... ANYONE can send ANYONE shit thru the mail so the best defense is DENY DENY DENY, Don&#039;t ever admit to anything. Let LE take you down town for a couple of hours it won&#039;t matter because you will DENY DENY DENY that you had any knowledge of anyone who might want to send you drugs thru the mail. <br /><br />The one caveat that you must remember is that the intercepted package may give them cause to get a search warrant if you have anything in your home at the time the warrant is executed you most likely will need a lawyer and a good one at that. Hope this helps and thanks I needed that morning uplift still trying to clear my eyes.

				This was written by a a former usps employee. He explains what happens when your package gets intercepted.<br /><br /><br />Quote from: kittymonster on June 25, 2011, 11:38 pm<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;If they decide to do a controlled delivery&quot; If they find contraband what would prompt a controlled delivery and what would not?<br /><br /><br />Small, personal amounts of drugs were usually removed and sent to the drug vault, and the letter/package re-sealed and delivered to the recipient with a letter saying that the shipment was illegal and the contraband removed.&nbsp; This was also the case for any steroids.&nbsp; Quantity would prompt a controlled delivery.&nbsp; If you send a pound of cocaine in the mail and it gets intercepted, you&#039;re getting a controlled delivery. <br />

Sometimes you&#039;ll get a love letter and sometimes you won&#039;t (years ago they used to send lots of them but now they don&#039;t send them that often)...if you get a letter just throw it in the trash and go about your business.

				Quantity = police dressed as postman at your door demanding you sign for it, possible raid afterwards.<br />Small amount = letter telling you to quit it. Maybe address blacklisted for additional mail scrutiny in future

				alright here&#039;s some good info on controlled deliveries. From what I&#039;ve read on people&#039;s posts who have been busted and others who have recieve various opened packages marked by customs.. They usually let a good amount of packages go through to build up evidence against you..&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen many users say that the LE said they had caught 7 packages before they actually decided to raid. Other users get their package with cuts open on it or a letter/stamp of customs.&nbsp; Usually.. You&#039;ll either get a hint that they&#039;re finding your stuff or they&#039;ll randomly raid after a few packages go through..<br /><br />this intel above was gathered from various posts from users in this community.&nbsp; <br /><br />tl;dr : USE MULTIPLE ADDRESSES!!!&nbsp; if you have things that arrive in envelopes send them to one address, large boxes of MDMA send it to a 1 time use address. Signed packages are also usually 1 time deals as well.&nbsp; Personally I wouldn&#039;t send more than 3 packages to one address with out switching it up for a few months.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also use believable&nbsp; names or names of past residents!<br /><br />REMEMBER!&nbsp; ADMIT TO NOTHING!
