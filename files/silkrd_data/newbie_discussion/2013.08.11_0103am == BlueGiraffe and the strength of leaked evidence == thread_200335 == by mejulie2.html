				sorry if we&#039;re not allowed to talk about it, but i can&#039;t see why not<br /><br />is that enough evidence to get charged? or even convicted if charged? provided no other evidence was found and one wasn&#039;t an idiot with the police

				No, but it&#039;s enough to trigger a &quot;knock and talk&quot;, and a lot of times shit goes downhill fast from there if you aren&#039;t educated on whatever rights you have in whatever country you&#039;re in.<br /><br />As someone who has never sent my address unencrypted, and uses tails, ect ect it pisses me off to no end that a vendor would store addresses indefinitely. (at all really, but BG still had every single one, apparently)<br /><br />

				Buyers on the Farmer&#039;s Market were mailed sternly worded letters saying &quot; we know what you did and we can prosecute you&quot;, but the reality is that an address alone isn&#039;t enough to convict you. If you ordered a large amount, enough to resell, then yeah you might get a knock and talk or your address might be watched, but for small amounts I doubt they care.

				the product and quantity details werent in the document, its literally no more than SR usernames and names/addresses. so i guess who they go and see is no more than pot luck and on top of that i don&#039;t think they can make a specific charge<br />&quot;your address was in a drug dealers email account (we can&#039;t charge you with that but we&#039;re not going to tell you)&quot; doesnt mean shit compared to &quot;we believe you bought x grams of y and are charging you with possession of this substance.&quot; i believe there&#039;s no conspiracy to possess charge for domestically obtained substances unlike in the states, so they would need to know specifics<br /><br />thanks for the insights, and yeah im not sure how BG never got round to deleting the log every day for months... still i may use him again simply because it was good shit and i think we can be sure hes going to tighten up his business practices

				this is why i only order international, that way if another LE get a hold of my address who gives a fuck, the DEA ain&#039;t gonna fly over to Ireland to arrest some random pothead, what exactly happened with Bluegirraffe anyway?

				i dont think we can assume that LE don&#039;t exchange information with other countries, whatever the laws are<br />plus you have to worry about customs<br /><br />its all in the SR discussion section but basically, BG hired a new assistant who couldnt get PGP working so she sent the full buyer list (she was only supposed to send it for that day) over tormail and one day later, FH got taken down

				fair point, i still doubt they would exchange information on the volumes i&#039;m getting, people who are involved with the sort of level i am involved with don&#039;t tend to do time in my country, our only use to the cops is as a rat on someone who&#039;s up to something bigger, it seems like it would be a lot of work for a bust which wouldn&#039;t lead to someone being imprisoned and which wouldn&#039;t get them anyone higher in the chain as they would know the contacts would be through silkroad, but alas dealing in hypotheticals its hard to formulate a model as to how things go, any talk i&#039;ve heard of raids due to postage in Ireland have been at closest second hand information, and a re generally about a &quot;friend of a friend&quot; which 9/10 means bullshit<br /><br />shit buzz on the bluegirraffe thing, i&#039;d consider that bluegiraffes fault as he should have ensured she could use the technology before giving her free rein

				yeah for a first time offense possessing class C you would hardly go to prison, might get a small fine or a caution (or nothing!) but i read a bit of speculation that LE could take the opportunity to do a worldwide&nbsp; &quot;SR crackdown&quot; and say they dealt a massive blow to online drugs trade etc etc<br /><br />still though i think it would be a waste of time since most of the people on BGs list are probably not big time. at all. that doesnt stop them spinning their story but it does make it harder to convict since the evidence is easy destroyed and what they do have is purely circumstantial. they still dont have substance, quantity, cant access order history on SR even if you log in for them etc<br /><br />would suck if i could never go to america though!

				if they crack down on SR realistically all they&#039;l get will be a couple of players, and won&#039;t really effect the market, as i&#039;m sure you know. They&#039;d blow it up to be a big deal though like they did with that dude in Australia.<br /><br />Ah well i guess the past customers of BG really have nothing to worry about in that case, would be way to time-consuming to stake out a load of addresses which may only have a gram or two in them at a time. Don&#039;t worry bout not going to the states, pop next-door to uber tollerant canada (although not for long if Harper has his way) and get the nice side of American culture without the gun-toting maniacs and meth-heads
