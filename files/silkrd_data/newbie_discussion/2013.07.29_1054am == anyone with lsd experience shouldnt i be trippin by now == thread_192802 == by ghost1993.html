				maybe some &quot;not_so_potent&quot; blotters? <br /><br />and on a sidenote, weed (especially with zero tolerance and them some haze) can make you trip ... not a &quot;light drug&quot;. =) But you know this for sure.<br /><br />If you took 2 blotters with maybe 100 +- Âµg L on them ... you should def. feel it.<br /><br />take care<br />12345

				The weed trips. Just recently I was grinding some buds and adding some hash. Not sure on the type of hash but the trip was sooo nice.<br />In fact that trip is what led me here, good buds and good hash.<br />Sorry about the bad blotters btw.

				Is it your first time? Most people report they don&#039;t trip for the first time. Either that or it&#039;s bunk cid. If it is that sucks. Nobody should have to take bunk shit.

				but if you are not tripping this time ... let it go. DO NOT TAKE MORE! ,-)<br /><br />make a pause til next week. Then try again. If you plan of taking more and more... you could find yourself in a strange state of mind which is at least &quot;tricky&quot; to handle.<br /><br />take care<br />12345
