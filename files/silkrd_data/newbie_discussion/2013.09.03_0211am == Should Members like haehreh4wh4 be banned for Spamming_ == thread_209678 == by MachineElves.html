				I know people have different opinions (I would have it no other way! ;D ), but to see new members post 27+ identical posts and sill have no negative karma is a little frustrating&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I know it may be tempting to SPAM your way to 50 post and yeah I can understand peoples frustrations at not getting in to the &quot;General Forums&quot; immediately.<br /><br />HOWEVER - AND THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br /><br />The system is set like this for a reason, its designed encourage new people to introduce themselves, discuss matters with fellow &quot;noobs&quot; all under the watchful eyes of Sr and Hero Members.<br /><br />Yes - Hero and Sr Members DO frequent the Newbies Forum.&nbsp; Its the first place they look to gauge the quality (read trustworthiness) of new buyers / vendors.<br /><br />By posting endless SPAM, just to get to your 50 posts is counter-productive as it send all the wrong messages to fellow posters and the more experienced vendors / member.&nbsp; Exactly the people you want to get &quot;on-side&quot;.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you start creating a new post that interests people, promoting discussion and simply comment on reply&#039;s etc?<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t take long and besides it isn&#039;t a race.&nbsp; The experienced vendors have all gone this route, to cut their teeth in the beginning......<br /><br />You should follow their example.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you use up a few posts here? : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206760.0<br /><br />Pass on your experiences to like minded people.....it&#039;s far more interesting that seeing endless SPAM posts and complaints.<br /><br />You are better than this. The community deserves better!!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				LOL, Spamming to 50 had a good chuckle at that!<br /><br />Seriously he is just spamming to try to get people to vist the site and buy BTC.<br /><br />When he hits 50, he will leave the newbie section and spam the rest of the forums.<br /><br />

				At least he now has -1 Karma, but to me this is still &quot;cheating&quot; and gives off a lack of trustworthiness.<br /><br />Do people generally spam their way to 50 posts and then start posting decent content and start contributing to the community?<br /><br />Am I doing something wrong? (i.e. Should I just post another 40 single posts to a spam topic?......my conscience tells me NO!)<br /><br />Finally, why is there not more of an outcry, when there are lots of good &quot;Noobs&quot; playing the game fairly and helping to establish trust and relationships with fellow members new and old?<br /><br />(Scratches head)<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				Look he is selling something outside of SR which is against the rules the mods will delete the account.<br /><br />Karma means jack shit, i however earned mine.<br /><br />And yes lots of decent folk spam to 50. In fact id say the majority of people on the forum spam to 50.<br /><br />Edit, this is my 100th post, i can now neg everyone yay.<br /><br />Chill Winston.

				Machine Elves, you speak a lot of sense.<br /><br />The system (from my limited reading) is set up exactly like you say.<br /><br />And as Trollin points out - the Mods (if they are worth their salt), will delete the account.<br /><br />There are always idiots in forums, and its up to people like you two to call them out and let the Mods do their work.<br /><br />I am disappointed that there are an element that do get away with spamming their way to 50, the Mods could be a little more firm on that side of things.<br /><br />Bottom line, I think it would promote good discussion / debate and less bitching and complaining.<br /><br />RANT OVER!

				if you&#039;re talking about the bitcoin spammers then iirc that&#039;s why the newbie section was set up, to keep the spam contained in one area. the mods delete the lot as soon as they can.<br />most newbies spam to 50 because they want to post something in a specific section. it&#039;s completely pointless in the case of reviews or scam warnings as who would trust mr 50 spam posts and 1 &#039;sincere&#039; post.

				I&#039;m gonna leave it up to the moderators I for one wont spam to 50 the newbie section is where i belong for now plus it kind of works as a general section that can be used for anything. I agree with you on trying to connect and communicate with other users though I love the forums :P
