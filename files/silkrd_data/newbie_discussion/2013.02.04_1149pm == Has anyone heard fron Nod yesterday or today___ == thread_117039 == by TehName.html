				Wish I could post in the regular areas such as the rumor mill or other general discussion areas, as I find it somewhat unlikely that this will get many views....<br /><br />So after spending the better part of FIVE frustrating days dealing w/ issue after issue (ZipZap LOST my transaction for 2 days, then 3 were spent dealing w/ the stupid PIN resetting process) getting my coins deposited/transferred into my SR account, I finally put an order in for a ball of boogar sugar from &#039;Nod&#039; at the crack of dawn on Friday morning.<br /><br />He and I then traded a few messages back n forth throughout most of that day &amp; night... Having paid for express, my shipment was supposed to have gone out that day, arriving to me on Saturday (assuming everything went smoothly w/USPS). He informed me at the very end of the night that he decided not to ship that day in order to play it safe due to a particular &quot;scare&quot; that he had, and would be sending all of Friday/Saturday&#039;s orders out on Sunday, pushing my arrival date to Tuesday (tomorrow). While I was of course really bummed about no longer having the hopes of receiving the goods on Saturday in time for the wifey&#039;s bday festivities, I understood that sometimes it&#039;s best just to play things safe... The wife unit&#039;s bday was of course the main reason for spending the extra on express, as well as the reason I was so frustrated w/ all of the delays (not @ nod, just the delays).<br /><br />When I asked him last night (Sunday) if everything went well w/ getting the previous days&#039; packages out, I never heard back.... And still after another message indicating my concerns for the situation having not heard back from him since Saturday, I have still to this point not heard a thing. The messages are also still marked as &quot;unread&quot; by him.<br /><br />So after the novel of a rundown that I just gave, my question is simply has anyone heard from him today or yesterday? Im really keeping my fingers crossed that he got it out yesterday as he said he would, but without trying to jinx myself, I gotta say I have a feeling he may not have. Im also somewhat concerned that the incident that he mentioned may have turned into something more than just a &quot;scare&quot;.<br /><br />So, has anyone heard from him? If so, perhaps hes just waiting to respond to me until after it&#039;s sent out, and is busy dealing w/ the backups for the weekend (my hopes)..... Was anyone told something similar by him?<br /><br />Thanks in advance guys! Looking forward to contributing to the boards as much as possible. Ive been an active forum member for several of my other &quot;hobbies&quot; (if you can call drugs that lol) for several years, and more than understand the benefit that they can bring to such a marketplace/community.<br /><br />Cheers. Hope someone has some good news for me here....
