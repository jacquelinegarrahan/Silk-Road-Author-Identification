				&quot;Try not to antagonize L/E so much that their desire for revenge out weighs their better judgment. &quot;<br /><br />Think this could be acceptable not only for SR and drugs but just about any confrontation with L/E. Just enjoyed the quote as I was reading the forums..<br />carry on..

				It&#039;s sound advice, but also equally difficult to restrain your words when a civil servant with a God complex is barking in your face

				I guess the quote in the OP that proves the old saying you can put 1000 monkeys in front of 1000 typewriters and then they write a play or some shit, because Northernstar is a poster child for abortion.

				It amazes me how much tough talk there is about LE. I picture all the tough talkers as people who buy weed by the gram.<br /><br />The quote is solid, for sure. It just comes with maturity, I&#039;m pretty sure we all get smarter as we learn from our fuckups.

				I think this is wise on a number of different levels.<br /><br />To begin with, I don&#039;t think the police is the problem, although time will tell.&nbsp; I suspect very few people go into police work to bust average dopes for toking a joint.&nbsp; (DEA is another matter.&nbsp; They have issues.)&nbsp; Average cop would probably not give a shit if drugs were legalized, provided there were protections for minors and other innocents.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you cherish liberty, government is the problem.&nbsp; The day will come (sooner in the EU than in the states) when the police will have to make a choice.&nbsp; We will see how the cookie crumbles, and I will see if I have to change my opinion.&nbsp; I will guarantee you, a lot of police officers these days stay awake at night worrying about this.&nbsp; To be clear, they worry a lot more about helping the government seize&nbsp; your personal property (guns, money) or take you as a political dissident.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it boils down to the same thing, in the end.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last time I got pulled over for a traffic violation, I had two eighths of shrooms on me.&nbsp; He chose not to search me, and sent on my way with a handshake and a warning.&nbsp; You&#039;re less likely to arouse suspicion, less likely to get the shit kicked out of you, and less likely to tack on additional charges if you clear your mind and fill your heart with love.&nbsp; &nbsp;And drive the speed limit (head smack).&nbsp;

				Similarly.. I was pulled over for speeding and had two 8ths of weed. Because of how i presented myself (im guessing) in a very respectable way, the state trooper surprisingly wrote me a ticket for speeding and told me because of how I presented myself he did not do a search of the car granted it smelt delicious<br />no more speeding over here though as i do know that is most likely to never happen again..
