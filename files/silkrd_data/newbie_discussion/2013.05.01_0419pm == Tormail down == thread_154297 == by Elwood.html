				New guy here. Haven&#039;t been able to log onto Tormail for some time, but was able to get onto the Road earlier today so that is a positive sign. Just came to say hello to all, and I am keeping my fingers crossed for better times on the network.

				TOR mail being down is new&#039;s? I am beginning to think it is run by the Feds it&#039;s the only thing that could explain how shitty the service is. Before anyone says &quot;It&#039;s free quit your bitchin&#039;&quot; STFU already. If you have a service out there free or not you should be able to keep it working if you can&#039;t then shut the fucker down.

Unfortunately there are those out there who have nothing better to do than launch attacks against SR and those people need to be dealt with. TOR Mail is not the same game. If they are experiencing attacks then they need to communicate with their members and let them know what&#039;s going on. There are a lot of very bright people on the TOR network and just maybe there may be some help available out there that could help TOR Mail get their act together.

				Tormail has been on and off (mostly off) for the past few days or so. As far as the honeypot theory goes, I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s much evidence giving credence to it, other than the fact that people don&#039;t know who created it. To be honest though, I think a lot of it is paranoia.
