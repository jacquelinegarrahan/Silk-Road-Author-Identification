				Just wondering if there was anyone on here who buys from overseas, either within the EU or outside of the EU?<br /><br />What sort of success rate with customs etc, I know customs aren&#039;t as strict here as they are in places like Canada?<br /><br />Just wondering your thoughts before deciding to take the plunge or not? Have always bought for UK face to face but its not great stuff, heard there are a few vendors on SR who provide quality stuff!&nbsp; :)

				That sounds good, I&#039;ve had small packages of class c&#039;s and get through almost every time, just worried about class a&#039;s, mainly because of smell with the coke, but I guess you just have to find a vendor with great feedback and stealth shipping!<br /><br />What sort of amounts have you imported with success if you dont mind me asking?<br /><br />Was the South American a vendor on here, I had a look and couldn&#039;t find any on here.<br /><br />Thanks for your reply!&nbsp; :)

				Only had one package never turn up and it was a domestic order. <br /><br />Don&#039;t meet face to face with anyone, ever. LlyodsBrothers have decent coke, expensive but decent quality.
