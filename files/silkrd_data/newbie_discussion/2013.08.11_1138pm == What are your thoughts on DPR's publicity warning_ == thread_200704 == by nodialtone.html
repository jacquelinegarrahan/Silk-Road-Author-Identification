				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=199579.0<br /><br />I assume DPR commented for the article and he&#039;s telling us in advance so we know the words are really his. <br /><br />Do you think bringing more publicity to SR is a good idea? Personally, I can&#039;t decide if this is good or bad for the community until I read the article or see the broadcast.<br /><br />I do think SR should be accessible to as many people as possible. We may get more buyers, but we may also get more sellers. Growth is a good thing for the movement, and a good thing for business. But with that comes the risk of more scammers and more attention from LE.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think it&#039;s a bold move on his part. It&#039;s hard to tell if it&#039;s going to be a good thing or bad thing. If it pisses the Gov, FBI, NSA, and CIA it could be bad but in reality they all know about this place. If they really wanted to I think it could be gone within a week. All the government agencies now work closely together. You&#039;d have the NSA intercepting and cracking data finding out details about shipments, orders, and other intel then passing it on to the FBI who would be doing the field work such as intercepting packages stopping suspects. SR has been going for over 2 years now but nothing lasts forever and if I was DPR I would try to be as low key as possible or perhaps he&#039;s just doing it as a big fuck you to the three letter word agencies. Mind you we have no idea how SR is locked down or what security measures he has in place nor do I want to know either.

				Thats crazy.&nbsp; There are obvious negative aspects to further publicity of sr.&nbsp; But, if sr is as secure as the people running it say it is then publicity will be positie for the market and lower the prices on here.&nbsp;

				Keep in mind, DPR doesn&#039;t control whether SR gets publicized. I doubt he asked for the publicity. He probably was approached by a news organization that was doing a story and had to decide whether to cooperate. There&#039;s nothing he could do to prevent the story from airing or being written. However, it will definitely get a lot more attention if he did offer his comments (which is sounds like is the case).<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to learning more.

				I think DPR did an interview over some type of secure messaging (hope not tormail lol).&nbsp; I honestly hate to see anymore attention brought to SR, but let&#039;s face it, LE is very well aware of it already. <br /><br />But if it&#039;s some kind of big US news exposure (ala 20/20 or dateline or something) I fear the politicians will bring enough pressure that the NSA will get involved, and as has been expressed in another thread by one of our most tech savvy posters, the NSA can probably break TOR.<br />

				Its hard to say whether the immediate outcome will be good but in the longer run I think we will win the argument.&nbsp; Taking the argument to the public is ultimately a good thing in my humble opinion.&nbsp; In the meantime we have a lot of idiot politicians who pander to a rable stirred up by demagogues and other crazies.<br /><br />Still 50 years ago, in the US, you had to ride in the back of the bus if you were black,&nbsp; we have come some way but have a ways to go.&nbsp; Still we are definitely making progress,&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have faith DPR will handle the situation. DPR has done other interviews(not sure if it&#039;s this DPR or it was a different one) nonetheless the questions asked and the answers given were excellent. I&#039;ll try to dig it up. After reading that interview you would of thought SR was the cure for aids, lol.

				Part of me wants the site to stay under the radar&nbsp; so I can continue to enjoy the freedom SR gives me. The other part wants to help convince others that the War on Drugs has lasted way to long and is more destructive than the consequences it is supposed to protect the public from.
