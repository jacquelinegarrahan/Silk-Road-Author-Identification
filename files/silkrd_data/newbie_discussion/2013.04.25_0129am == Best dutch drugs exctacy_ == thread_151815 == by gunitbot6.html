				You should always do a bit of research on the vendor before ordering. Many will suggest &quot;the best stuff ever, 100%&quot; which will mostly be untrue. Most synthesis processes will yield 76% or more typically 84% MDMA. This is not to say that the remaining 15-25% is gunk! It could partially be MDA, MDEA or other related yeilded products - and no doubt some gunk.<br /><br />Honest providers will have lab tested at 76% or 84%. If you&#039;re doing a pill for the first time, and you have reasonable feedback&nbsp; from those around you who have taken before, then 1 pill is a good start. If you&#039;re talking powder, I would suggest 120mg (keeping in mind that at an 84% yield this is about 100mg) is a safe and reasonable start.<br /><br />Have fun, and keep safe!

				You can always buy a pill testing kit. Simple instructions and takes about 5 mins to confirm what your pills contain. If they are waxy in texture dont eat them. If they smell like aniseed thats a good sign. Good pills should be solid press and not crumble to easily. Look up pill testers on ebay. about $50. They test for more than just MDMA too. Check&nbsp; www.pillreports.com too. Just make sure they are the same pills as good pills have dodgy copies out circulating too. If they are dutch chances are they will be good. If first time take 1/2 first. Test them first if you are in doubt.
