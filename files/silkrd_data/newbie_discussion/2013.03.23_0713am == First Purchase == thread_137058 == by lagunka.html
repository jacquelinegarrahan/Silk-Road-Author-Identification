				Hi I&#039;ve been lurking around the forums as well as on the road for a long time now and I believe I&#039;ve finally decided to make my first order. I&#039;m a little perplexed as to how I should go about it though. All over the forums it seems the general opinion is that one should never FE on an order, though it says on most vendors pages that I must do this if I am a first time customer. I also have no transaction history which many vendors require that you have prior orders. If I FE on a small order and I have no history purchasing I feel like I&#039;m just asking to get scammed. SO how should I go about making my first order? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

				1. Never fucking finalize early, NEVER!<br /><br />Lmao now that the dramatics are over....<br /><br />2. Play some lottos or do some other cool shit on SR to build up your buyer stats!<br /><br />3. Choose the right vendor who won&#039;t discriminate on n00bs!<br />

				@LogicalSharkFart <br />MarijuanaIsMyMuse doesn&#039;t require FE for first timers but I have heard a lot of reviews on their MDMA that it isn&#039;t the highest quality. I got some of the pressed pills and initial tested w/ someone without a very high tolerance and it went well.<br /><br />If anything, just talk to the vendors - if it is a small domestic order, I&#039;m sure some would be able to make an exception.

				It&#039;s best do only Btc lotto&#039;s, so you don&#039;t fool the feedback system for others who are buying from a drug vendor.

				Lot&#039;s of vendors don&#039;t require you to FE, even if you&#039;re new and have little/no stats. Look around. Also, the vendors that do say &quot;you must FE if you have little to no stats&quot;.. it cant hurt sending them a private message asking if they&#039;re waive that for you? Vendors are humans, not robots. They usually have a&nbsp; common sense and a feel for how shit works. What&#039;s the worse they can do... refuse to waive the policy? Plenty of fish in the sea. Look around. My first purchase on the road I sent a PM to a top rated vendor who said new buyers have to FE and politely asked if he could waive that. You know his answer? &quot;No problem man, no need to FE. You&#039;re good!&quot; I won&#039;t give his name but there are vendors out there.<br /><br />And like White Out says..NEVER FINALIZE EARLY. Just don&#039;t do it man. Make that YOUR policy (the way some vendors have THEIR policy), make it YOUR policy. You&#039;ve got the buying power, your the buyer. As long as your not LE, vendors want your money. Even if you are LE, they&#039;ll probably still take your money :)<br />FE defeats the purpose of escrow. This entire playground is about risks anyways. Vendors take a risk every time they mail a package, buyers take a risk everytime they order drugs in the mail. You take a risk everytime you step out of your house that lighting might strike you dead.<br /><br />Anyways, don&#039;t FE. Fuck FE. Double fuck FE. Don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />Goodluck with your first purchase and cherish it. The first time the mailman comes with your SR package and you go get your mail, bring it in and open it.. you&#039;ll always remember that feeling.

				Finalize Early means to finalize the payment, and give the vendor your money, BEFORE you recieve the goods. Generally advised against, because once you pay the vendor you have no protection and SR can&#039;t help you if the vendor doesn&#039;t send the package or the right amount or something, because your money is gone. <br /><br />Sorry can&#039;t help with your other questions Michael, I suggest reading giving the wiki a read tho.

				I FE&#039;d on my very first order on SR and got scammed. Now, shittons of purchases later, I consider that a very cheap lesson on the road. Simply put, there will ALWAYS be a seller who doesn&#039;t require FE for new members...they may be more expensive, but its worth it. Once you get a few transactions built up, you&#039;ll be happy you never FE&#039;d.

				I don&#039;t know what you are looking for but I am an established vendor and I don&#039;t require FE, only an acknowledgement you understand how to get on and finalize when you receive and try the product.
