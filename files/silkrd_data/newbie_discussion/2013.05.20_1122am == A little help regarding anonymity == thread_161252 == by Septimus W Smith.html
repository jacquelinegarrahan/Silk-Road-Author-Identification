				Ok, so I know these questions are tedious but this is the newbie page so maybe somebody can help me out.<br /><br />I&#039;m still preparing for my first SR purchase. The current plan (and this may or may not be ridiculous) is a face to face purchase from localbitcoins with an account linked to a fake name, a tor email address and a throwaway prepaid phone. It&#039;ll be from a vendor who&#039;ll bypass their website system and pay directly into my SR wallet. <br /><br />First question: How good a plan is the above?<br /><br />Second question: And this might be the ridiculous one. What exactly is gained from ensuring total anonymity transferring into your SR account? There are some legal items on the silk road, so just using the site isn&#039;t a crime (right?) and my personal details would always be encrypted with pgp when I make any purchase. So what exactly could LE do if they tracked bitcoins to my SR account? How could I realistically be linked to any illegal transaction?<br /><br />Disclaimer: I&#039;m sure to the initiated, that this thread was the equivalent of a toddler asking what quantum entanglement is but please be gentle. I am, after all, just trying to understand enough to be a safe, contributing member of this awesome community. <br /><br />x

				Your plan would definitely keep you anon as long as the person that you meet knows nothing about you! However I think this is overkill and I wouldn&#039;t be to keen on the face to face purchasing of BTC.<br /><br />I personally just get my coins using bitbargain with an account that cant really be linked to me then i move the coins between a thew throw away wallets in different amounts and then finally to my SR account!<br /><br />I think that the bitcoin and SR are that popular now that even if LE wanted to they just wouldn&#039;t have time to follow all the stuff that is happening so you will be fine to purchase the coins how you like i would say!

				A little overkill with the throw away phone. Just don&#039;t tell the guy your name! <br /><br />If you want another method then use bitinstant. You can deposit cash at a local money gram location and send it directly to your SR account. Create a fake name, with fake address, birthday, address in the location you are depositing, (apt building) and create a fake phone number. Punch all the info into bitinstant and when you show up to the money gram store just make sure you either have that info memorized or ready to give to the person. I use the mom and pop places that have money gram. Good luck!

				It looks like on I&#039;m the right track then and good to know that, if anything, I&#039;m being overly cautious. I&#039;ll do a bit more research on those other methods although it doesn&#039;t look like bitinstant works in the UK (at least it won&#039;t let me select UK as my location). What about the second question? I&#039;m still not entirely clear on why all these precautions are necessary. How exactly could LE get you if you disregarded all this anonymity protection?

				I think you r being paranoid. I was like that too my first time, but once you get into the system you start to realize how safe it is.<br />My reasoning is that LE doesn&#039;t have the will, time or resources to go after small time buyers. So, as long as you keep it low you should be alright.<br />In a worst case scenario, what would happen? Get a warning from LE? I can live with that.<br /><br />After 15 successful buys this is my system. I get on localbitcoins, find a reputed vendor online, bank transfer to his account, get the coins. The whole process takes 15 mins max with a good vendor. Then I transfer the coins to my bitcoinqt wallet ( i dont trust any web service to hold my coins). Then SR will tumble it for me and at this point the coins cant be traced back to your account. <br /><br />Simple, fast. Yes there is a very remote chance that someone could connect the dots but can you see how much resources would take for LE to do that? do you really think they can be bothered for a small amount of drugs? I dont think so.<br /><br />Good luck on your first buy, I envy you now, mine was quite a thrill! :-)<br /><br />&nbsp;

And I can vouch for this guy. What he says is true. Unless they intercept a large amount of drugs from that transaction of bitcoins than you should have no worries.

				It sounds like engordany&#039;s method is a reasonably safe one and certainly less involved than my original plan. They won&#039;t be large orders just small amounts for personal consumption and only ever class Bs and Cs so it looks like I should be ok. Thanks a lot guys. Really, there&#039;s some good info here and not just for me. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll help others too.
