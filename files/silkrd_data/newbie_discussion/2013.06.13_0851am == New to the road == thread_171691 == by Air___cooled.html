				Old to the scene. There&#039;s quite a bit I need to learn about this place and what it can offer. I&#039;m a member on some other boards that would bust out the ban hammer in an instant if I posted about sources/products/ect, so this place will take some getting used to. Anyway, any help with bitcoin, pgp, safety and security would be appreciated.

				Welcome to the road!<br /><br />I can pass on a bit of advice about the things you have asked about.<br /><br />BITCOINS: Depends where you are from, I&#039;m in UK and options are limited but there is two places i would recommend for purchasing your bitcoins and thats localbitcoins (CLEARNET: Localbitcoins.com) and bitbargain (CLEARNET: Bitbargain.com)! Since finding the road both of these websites have been quite useful to me and allow you to buy bitcoins quite quickly (especially bitbargain). With these you can use some methods that provide you with a lot more anonymity such as bank deposits.<br /><br />Once you have your bitcoins you can either just send them through to your silk road BTC wallet (this also goes through SR&#039;s coin tumbling service first) or you can put you coins through a tumbler service such as bitfog (TOR: http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion) or bitlaundry (TOR: http://znegstqkxqrdflol.onion). A tumbler service basically mixes your coins with others and then splits them all back up and redistributes the coins back to you leaving them pretty much untraceable. However these services do charge a fee so its up to you if you want to take this step or not, I don&#039;t because I dont believe I use enough bitcoins to warrant it.<br /><br />If your not in the UK there is probably other options available to you that you may want to look into!<br /><br />EDIT: There is also a good guide that explains bitcoins that is wrote by a vendor called Medicine Women who has made it available on the road for free just follow this link: <br /><br />TOR: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/25045a8e31<br /><br />PGP: This is quite important especially when sending a vendor you name and address because it mean that if the message was ever intercepted your details could not be read and the only person that can decrypt your message is the vendor that the message is meant for!<br /><br />I use windows so can only really help you with the windows method of setting up PGP. But you need to download a piece of software called GPG4Win (CLEARNET: www.gpg4win.org). During the installation you will be asked to choose the components you wish to install and on this step you must make sure you select GPA.<br /><br />Once installed you can use this straight away without creating your own keys. You just copy a vendors public key into a text file and then save it on your computer then you open GPA and import the key by selecting import and then locating the text file on your computer. Once the key has been imported it will tell you if it has been successful and will appear in your keychain. you can then just select clipboard, type in your message, select encrypt and then select the key you want to use. You will then have a nice encrypted message that can only be decrypted by the vendor. You can also select multiple keys on one message, this means that multple people can decrypt your message and is very handy if you make orders with different vendors at the same time.<br /><br />If you want to set up your own private/public key I have put links to a couple of good resources that explain how to below:<br /><br />CLEARNET: Guide: http://gpg4win.de/handbuecher/novices_6.html<br />CLEARNET: Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-FyJXUxVQ0<br /><br />Safety and security: I have added a little info on some software that will help with this below<br /><br />TrueCrypt: This can be good because you can create an encrypted section on your hard drive that cant be decrypted without the password you set. You can then store all your files that relate to TOR in this area so even if your computer was seized they wouldn&#039;t be able to get to this data. This is definitely worth looking into.<br /><br />CCleaner: This is good because it has a tool called disk wiper. Basically even when you delete something on you computer its still there and can be found by LE. Even after moving anything into an encrypted section of your hard drive it will leave and image behind in the none encrypted area that could still be located. You can use disk wiper to write to the empty space on your disk 7 times and this will ensure everything is truly deleted! Another thing that is worth looking into.<br /><br />Tails: Tails is a linux live CD that can be burnt to disk or USB drive. You can then boot you computer into a linux&nbsp; operating system straight from the disk/USB. It comes with TOR and PGP installed. This provides more security because it literally leaves no trail behind on your computer.<br /><br />Privnote (CLEARNET: https://privnote.com/): Some vendors may ask you to use privnote. You just go to the site and type your message, it will then give you a link to the message that once opened will destroy the message and make the link redundant. This provides some level of security but if your message was ever intercepted before the link had been accessed it would mean that it could be viewed by the wrong eyes. I personally Don&#039;t like using this method.<br /><br />I don&#039;t claim to be an expert in safety, security or silk road and could not say this stuff guarantees your safety or anonymity, but its definitely a good place to start.<br /><br />This is what my experience with the road has taught me so far (I have also worked for a major ISP and I am currently a systems administrator which has also helped) but I&#039;m sure there will be a lot i have missed out here! I do hope this will help eliminate some of the learning curve for you tho.<br /><br />PS. NEVER FE, NEVER FE and NEVER FE

				Damn Trip your feeling the love today, remind me to +1 you when my post count hits 100.<br /><br />But just want to edit the info on Tails, its not a version of TOR its a bootable version of linux which comes with a TOR browser running on it.

				Welcome though am a new user too.<br /><br />Can vouch for bitbargain, been very easy to use, though do wonder how much over the odds we are paying using it, anyone know a rough estimate. However, transaction are straight forward, so far.<br /><br />CC cleaner is a great bit of kit and free, however be careful it can access bits of PC easily and cause issues if delete wrong things. The spyware type forums have some great guides on how to use for novices, which is me for sure.<br /><br />Am UK based too, so good to see others here too

				PGP is actually quite simple. I learned by youtubing it... there is a dude who hates jews who gives the lowdown on PGP. It definitely helps.
