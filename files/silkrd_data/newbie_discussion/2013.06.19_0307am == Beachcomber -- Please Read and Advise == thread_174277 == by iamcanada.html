				Mods if possible please move this thread to the rumor mill<br /><br />I placed an order with him on Saturday. He messaged me saying he could not decrypt my PGP message despite other vendors having no issues with my encrypted messages. Ended up using privnote, I know it is not as safe but had no other alternative. <br /><br />I ordered Xpresspost which clearly should have tracking. I message for my tracking and got no reply despite my message clearly being read. I sent another one, which was also read, but not replied too. <br /><br />His profile clearly states tracking is available. What do you guys think is going on? What should I do?<br /><br />My order is quite large and has already been marked in transit so I cannot cancel. I am sort of worried, especially with his last two feedback scores being 4/10

You have several alternatives. Re-encrypt your PGP message and try again or find a different vendor.

				I never liked the look of Beachcomber and have always avoided his listings for weed.<br /><br />Check out PKHydro or Mrouid if it&#039;s weed you are looking for. They are a bit more expensive but all quality and professional

				I have placed an order with PKHydro and with WhiteShark<br /><br />I read too many mad things about Mr Ouid to want to try him out<br /><br />Still no reply from Beachcomber...sigh<br /><br />WTF<br /><br />He reads my messages but continues to ignore me. I assume if a package with tracking does not show and tracking is not provided SR would provide 100% refund?
