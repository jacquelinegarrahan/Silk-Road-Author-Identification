				Did a quick search but couldn&#039;t find anything. What is karma in relation to this forum? How do we get it, and can we give it out? Whats the score with positive and negative karma, can someone link me to an explanation, as i&#039;m sure ther&#039;l probably be one somewhere and i&#039;m just relatively stupid/new to the forum.<br />If not, can someone explain :)<br /><br />Also, so i dont have to make another topic, is it possible to subscribe to threads that you have posted in? a common feature on many forums. Is this the one under &#039;updated topics&#039; or is there a different one?<br /><br />Cheers

				we were all new once. the karma is a &quot;thank&quot; or &quot;discourage&quot; option that is for forum members that have more than 100 post i believe its 100 anyway. so if u see someone giving help or being cool u can &quot;thank&quot; them and that gives them a positive karma. if u see a troll being a dick or just a guy posting sum bullshit u can &quot;discourage&quot; them and that will show as a negative karma. and the way to subscribe to a thread just post in it, and then up at the top of the page it says &quot;show new replies to your post&quot; that will bring up a page with all the threads that you have posted in that have been replied to. good luck and enjoy ur time on the road there is a very helpful community here so if u have questions just ask weve all been there before.

				Great thanks alot for the explanation :) Can you see which of your posts got karma/bad karma?<br /><br />Up to my 50th post now so i can venture out into the big wide world of other forums! =D<br /><br />Is there a cap to the amount of posts you can give karma to etc? And do you have to have a certain amount of posts to recieve karma?<br /><br />Cheers your response pal

				no u cant see which post u made that the person gave the + or - karma to. i believe that once you are eligible to give out karma that you can only do so once every 24 hours, i could be wrong about that but i know there is some waiting period so that members dont just go hard on other members karma. there isnt any amount of post that a member has to have to receive karma, just make post that are on topic and beneficial and someone will eventually give u sum.

				I got negative karma for my first post on here, so I&#039;m a bit bitter about the system... but then again, I deserved it. I started my illustrious career on here by bashing veteran vendors for their prima donna rants about buyers emailing them too much and demanding FE. Looking back on it, out of twenty odd vendors I&#039;ve used there was only one that upset me, and legitimately so... So I shouldn&#039;t have generalized myself and gone off on a rant of my own, just because one vendor sat way too high up on a horse for my taste. <br /><br />One vendor in particular took notice, and took offense. Oops. I tried to backtrack later, but to no avail, and besides he&#039;d already given me the negative karma. Now I wear it proudly as a reminder to be less bitter and more respectful on the site. <br /><br />Point is, at the end of the day, I like the idea of karma points. Hopefully in time I&#039;ll prove myself a valuable enough resource to deserve some positive karma. And to all of you out there with 100 posts, I love you and respect you and think the world of you. :)
