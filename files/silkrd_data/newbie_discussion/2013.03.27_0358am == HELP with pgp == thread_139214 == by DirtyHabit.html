				Hello,<br />I know with my post i`ll make some people laugh like crazy but i guess i`m a big noob.<br />I managed to make 2 keys with GNU but i don`t know if one is private and one is public.. <br />I tried to look around this forum but when i try to search is telling me that i already searched in the last 5 seconds, and as much as i wait i can`t use the search function. A link will be greatly appreciated.<br />last problem is that after hours and hours looking for tutorials and etc i managed to send a message to a vendor but dumb as i am i can`t/don`t know how to read the message i got back... <br />Thanks for any help offered... :D

				Your public key is safe. To the best of my knowledge you cannot view it and it is attached to your account.<br /><br />To send an encrypted message to your vendor you need to go to the vendor&#039;s profile page and copy their key. Paste their key into a notepad on your computer and save it. Name the file after the vendor.<br /><br />Click import on the PGP software you&#039;re using. You need to select the notepad you have just saved with the vendor&#039;s key. Their name will now appear in the list of keys you have stored on your computer. <br /><br />Open the clipboard on your PGP app and type your address/message details then click encrypt. Your PGP app should give you a list of the keys you can use to encrypt the message, make sure you select your vendor&#039;s one.<br /><br />To receive encrypted messages you will need to provide people with your public key. Select the key you want to use and click export, this will save a file containing your key. Find that file and try to open it. You will probably be asked which service you want to open the file in, you may need to do a search to open the file in notepad.<br /><br />Copy and paste the key and send it to anyone who you want to send you an encrypted message. When you receive an encrypted message you simply paste it into the clipboard in your PGP app. You will be prompted for your passcode, once entered your message will be decrypted.<br /><br />When setting up a key you are asked to enter an email address. Go and set up a Tormail address here: http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/ <br />DO NOT USE ANY EMAIL ADDRESS YOU USE IRL. Set up a dedicated email address instead.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK

				Have you read this?<br />http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/<br /><br />To read the vendor&#039;s message, did you find their PGP public key to decrypt it ?<br /><br />

				@spokeknife<br /><br />You don&#039;t need the vendor&#039;s public key to decrypt a message they send you, that will not work.<br /><br />You use the vendor&#039;s key to encrypt a message that you send to them.

				As far as this has gone...let&#039;s decipher a little.<br /><br />When People talk of a PGP Key, you have to bear in mind, that this key always consists of two keypairs. One is public( the one other people use to send you encrypted messages eg. vendor keys you see all around SR) and a private key( which you, and this means ONLY you, can use to decrypt messages signed with your public key). It is very important that you never give your private key to anyone! <br /><br />There are several ways of using PGP, GnuPG and other derivates. If you are on a windows system...i have no idea, but there are sure some neat tools...if you are on a linux and are familiar with shell and stuff, it should no problem to figure this one out ;)<br /><br />A small hint in the end...the messages you signed with another key, can&#039;t be decrypted with your private key. If you want to test, if this whole thing functions, just export your public key, use it do encrypt a message...which you will in another step try to decode. If you manage to get from plain to ASCII (or .txt to .asc) and again from ASCII to plain, you got it. Then feel free to test it with a real person ;)<br />Cheers! ;)<br /><br /><br />

				As mantidman wrote above...try&nbsp; GPG4USB ;)<br /><br />Most of the linux distros also have GnuPG included...so that would be an alternative. Got a windows system myself in a vm and a box, but never used PGP on it(ok maybe 10 years ago, but today...:)
