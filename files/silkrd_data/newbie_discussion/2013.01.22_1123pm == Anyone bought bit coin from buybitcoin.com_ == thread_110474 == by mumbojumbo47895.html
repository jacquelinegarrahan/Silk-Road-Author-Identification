				I haven&#039;t used buybitcoin.com but from what I&#039;ve read I wouldn&#039;t use it. Quite a few claims of people getting scammed by them. Like glasshouse said, you can buy bitcoins from a reputable vendor on SR like Sugar Mama. That method is pretty simple, just purchase a MoneyPak from a store with cash, add a listing of bitcoins for moneypak, and put your moneypak number in your address section when checking out. May take a day or two to get your coins depending on how busy the vendor is (they can only process a limited dollar amount per day with moneypaks). <br /><br />I prefer to do cash deposit at a bank branch, fees are generally lower than other methods and I get my coins within an hour or two. Lately I&#039;ve been using bitcopia.com which lets me do up to $1K per day.<br /><br />I certainly don&#039;t know every vendor and good business that sells bitcoins, I would recommend searching the vendor or business here on the forums and checking their feedback before sending anyone your money.

				I used sugar mama for my first coin purchase. Everything went smooth, got my coins in 3 days (as the post says &quot;For the Patient&quot;). You must not be in a hurry when buying from them. It seems like the&nbsp; more you spend,the faster it gets to your account.The only thing that concerned me is they asked for my zip code.&nbsp; Would recommend them tho.

				Nope never bought from them.&nbsp; I use bitinstant myself same as person above me?&nbsp; I would probably go with blueskytraders in second though I have never used they seem to have their shit together from what I hear.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are you happy silk road I posted my worthless opinion just to improve my post count and said the same thing as the poster above thereby clogging up the forum with a worthless post and also wasting my time and your time by having to sift throught repetitive posts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have a glorious day!
