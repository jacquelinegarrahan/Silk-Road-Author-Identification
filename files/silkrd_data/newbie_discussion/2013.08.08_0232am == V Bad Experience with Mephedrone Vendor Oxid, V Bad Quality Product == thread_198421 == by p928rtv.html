				I recently purchased 5gms of mephedrone from vendor Oxid. Based on my experience, I strongly recommend against dealing with him. In summary:<br />* He sent me product that was not mephedrone, and that was extremely weak and had little effect<br />* When I gave the product a poor evaluation of 1 in 5, he was most abusive,&nbsp; he falsely accused me of refusing to FE, and he refused to discuss my complaint.<br /><br />In part, what I learn from this is that in future, I should try the product before finalizing. For anyone interested, more details are below, along with the message exchange I had with Oxid.<br /><br /><br />THE PROBLEM IN MORE DETAIL<br /><br />I purchased 5gms of mephedrone from Oxid. It arrived promptly, and I then finalized. Upon trying the mephedrone some hours later, I found it wasn&#039;t mephedrone. I am familiar with the drug, and closely related cathinones, and am certain about this. I took a 200 mg dose, and it only had a very weak effect. It was certainly not as advertized: &quot;pure Mephedrone 99.8%. The purest explosive quality on SR.&quot;<br /><br />I therefore posted a score of 1 in 5, noting the prompt delivery, and the poor quality of the product ordered. I immediately received an abusive response from Oxid. He accused me of being a scammer, a dishonest person, a blackmailer, a bullshitter, and so on. He also said he had alerted other vendors to me, telling them I should be avoided because I had refused to FE (which is false, he never asked me to FE), and that I am a &quot;waste man&quot;. He said that I must correct or remove my bad score, otherwise he would contact SR staff. He made no attempt to address my concern about the product.<br /><br />In our subsequent correspondence (see below), he continued to be abusive, and to avoid addressing my underlying concern about product quality.<br /><br />Oxid has unusually high satisfaction scores (perhaps the best of any mephedrone vendor), and comments made about him are perhaps unusually short. It may be that he is gaming the system in some way.<br /><br />I believe that Oxid&#039;s response to me was wholly inappropriate, that he sold me bad product, and that his product descriptions are misleading and inaccurate.<br /><br />p928rtv<br /><br />THE MESSAGE THREAD BETWEEN MYSELF AND OXID<br />==========================================================<br />From Oxid to p928rtv. Friday August 2, 2013<br /><br />Your little game, will stop, you are a scammer, you have been reported on our vendor forum.<br /><br />Limetless: p928rtv<br /><br />Firstly the guy refused to FE when he knew full well he had to and then he bullshitted about my product. Avoid this wasteman.<br /><br />You have interest to correct or remove your bad feedback<br />BECAUSE your are a scammer and you practice blackmail!!!<br />I contact an administrator directly!<br /><br />===========================================================<br />From p928rtv to Oxid. Friday August 2, 2013<br /><br />Dear Oxid,<br /><br />Thank you for your fast reply to my posting of 1 out of 5 for the product I purchased from you, 5gms of what you advertise as &quot;pure Mephedrone 99.8%. The purest explosive quality on SR&quot;.<br /><br />You say I refused to FE. This is incorrect, I was never asked to FE. When the product arrived, I finalized without being asked to do so, before having tried the product.<br /><br />When I tried the product last night, I found that 200mg had minimal effect and so I posted a poor score of 1 out of 5 this morning, and requested that you provide me with your advice. I suggested I might return the product, and receive a refund.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why you describe my comment as bullshit, nor do I understand why you think I am a scammer and a blackmailer.<br /><br />Please can I return the product to you, and receive a refund.<br /><br />Many thanks<br /><br />p928rtvoxid(99)<br />==========================================================<br /><br />From oxid(99) to p928rtv. Friday August 2, 2013<br /><br />You are a dishonest person and the staff of silk road decide on the issue.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />oxiD!<br /><br />===========================================================<br />From p928rtv to Oxid. Friday August 2, 2013<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry Oxid, I don&#039;t understand why you accuse me of being a dishonest person. I tried your product, and found it to be very weak and not as advertized, so I posted a score of 1 in 5. In what way am I dishonest, please?<br /><br />===========================================================<br />From p928rtv to Oxid. Sunday August 4, 2013<br /><br />Dear Oxid,<br /><br />I haven&#039;t hard back from you, so am writing to follow up.<br /><br />I am experienced with the use of mephedrone and other cathinones, and I know that the product you sent me was not mephedrone. I would not have minded if you had sent me a cathinone with similar effect to mephedrone, but what you sent me had very limited effect. I have never experienced a cathinone from any vendor such that 200 mgms would have such minimal effect. What you sent me was definitely not what you advertized as &quot;pure Mephedrone 99.8%. The purest explosive quality on SR&quot;. It is possible that there was some sort of mistake, for example that I was sent product from a new batch you recently received.<br /><br />I regret that you responded by accusing me of being a scammer, a bullshitter, a wasteman, a blackmailer, and a dishonest person. I am none of these. I believe it would be more productive for both of us if you address my concern about product quality.<br /><br />I am also concerned that you have told other SR vendors that I am a scammer, that I refused to FE when I knew I had to, that I bullshitted about your product, that I am a blackmailer, and that I am a wasteman. I have bought from many SR vendors, and believe I am thought of as a good and reasonable customer. I certainly do not want my reputation to be sullied by you when there is no reason for this.<br /><br />I suggest that you and I try, over the next two days, to resolve this harmoniously and reasonably between ourselves. If we don&#039;t, then with regret let us escalate the matter to third parties as we deem appropriate. For myself, I will be forced to contact SR&#039;s Resolution Center.<br /><br />With thanks<br /><br />p928rtv<br /><br />===========================================================<br />From Oxid to p928rtv. Sunday August 4, 2013<br /><br />scam artist or fbi ???<br /><br />==========================================================<br />

				The sad thing is, I can&#039;t see much coming of this.&nbsp; You finalised, he has your money, I think the best scenario for you now is the intervention of Silkroad staff and getting a 50% refund, he&#039;s clearly not going to deal with this in a reasonable way.&nbsp; Props to you for the way you are handling this situation, but the contrary to him, it seems like complete irony that he called you a &#039;wasteman&#039; from his responses.&nbsp; I suppose for now all you can do is tarnish his rep until this is resolved.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Diceman:<br /><br />Thanks for your comment. I agree, there is little if any actual mephedrone, ie 4-MMC around these days. What is sold as mephedrone is some other sort of cathinone.<br /><br />My problem with Oxid is not that he hasn&#039;t provided 4-MMC, but that the product he provided had very little effect, much less effect than what I get from other &quot;mephedrone&quot; vendors. And then he literally added insult to injury, and avoided any discussion of my complaint.

				I feel your pain, but there is just no avenue in place to resolve it if you&#039;ve finalized.&nbsp; Unless the vendor has a change of heart and agrees to some kind of refund voluntarily, you just have to move on.&nbsp; I actually had two orders totalling $50 that I finalized even though I was 100% sure it was never shipped, just to not have refunds on my stats as a new buyer.&nbsp; The hazards of buying drugs on the internet I guess.&nbsp; <br />

				Thanks for posting this information. It helps to alert other mbrs who may be considering a purchase from this vendor. As for mephedrone, you are right, most stuff purporting to be 4MMC is some sort of cathinone analogues (there are a number of threads on this forum dedicated to this discussion and vendors) and there does seem to be quite a bit of feedback lately about very poor quality stuff currently being sold as mephedrone.

				Thanks to everyone for the feedback. I&#039;ll be more careful in future about finalizing.
