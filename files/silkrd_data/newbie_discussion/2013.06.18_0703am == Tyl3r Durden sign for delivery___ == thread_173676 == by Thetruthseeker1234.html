				Hello all, I recently ordered 4500 tabs of tyl3r&#039;s 25i. He sent it in three packages of 15, all via different methods. The first two came without a hitch. The third and final one didnt come. Instead I recieved a notice saying that I needed to sign for it and come into the post office to pick it up. Tyl3r had said nothing about signing for anything and the previous two didnt require signature so this has significantly freaked me out. I messaged him a few days ago and I can see he read my messages, but never replied. Someone help me here. Anyone have to sign for a package from tyl3r?

				Don&#039;t sign for it!! I can&#039;t imagine tyl3r would have sent anything that needed signing for (specially not just 1 out of 3 packages)! I would have advised that it didn&#039;t matter to much with it being 25i but as its now just become pretty much illegal every where i would watch out!<br /><br />Sounds like the package has been intercepted to me and they want you to sign for it to prove ownership!<br /><br />If i was you i would just take the loss and clean house!! If they attempt to deliver and get you to sign just say you wasn&#039;t expecting anything and return to sender!!<br /><br />That&#039;s what i would do anyway!

				Tyl3r just messaged me and he said it could be a mistake from the post office because he mailed it airsure.<br />I&#039;m still afraid to go in, but I will probably do it anyway.

				Is there anything special I should say when I go in? Something like, &quot;I have no idea what this is, but it must be important since it requirs signature.&quot; To the guy behind the counter.<br /><br />What does everyone think?

				if the first two orders got through ok and hes using different methods to post, consider this there in no smell from it, if any postal worker was opening stuff up and foud several sheets of tabs they would be taking that home, lol.&nbsp; I would just go there pick it up if something is said denigh it you got card saying come here pick up package you was gonna take it home open it up to see what it is as you have not ordered anything requiring a signature.&nbsp; down to them to prove it.&nbsp; but maybe move the stuff you already got off premises before going to collect i know i would.&nbsp; :o

				Well I went in today and got it without a hitch. The only weird part was there was a sticker on it that said C.O.D., or collect on delivery, which would have meant I would have had to pay the shipping fee&#039;s. luckily the woman behind the counter said,&quot; it must be a mistake,&quot; and took it off.<br /><br />Once again tyl3r comes through. He deserves his top 1%rank.<br /><br />Much love to everyone

				I frequently have to sign for parcels that shouldn&#039;t require it. Not sure if it&#039;s my post office or what. I sure don&#039;t want to be a total heatscore and start sketching out in the post office refusing to sign for a parcel. Could only refuse to sign once, and then it&#039;s pretty much certain that they are going to be watching my mail a lot more closely.
