				Who else here thinks the spammers should be banned from the forum? it&#039;s annyoing because it weeds out important threads and makes them harder to see and is just in general and eye sore. I&#039;m not talking about the thread where it says &quot;50 post thing&quot; ..thats fine if people want to make a thread where you can post to get your count thing up.. i&#039;m talking about the person making 30 threads to advertise their bitcoins .. report it to the mods or tell them to fuck off. One thread is enough to advertise.. and theyre probably a scam anyway.

				They are banned. They just register new accounts. And there&#039;s no &quot;probably&quot; about it. They are 100% guaranteed scams.

				My 2c is that not all unsolicited messages automatically count as spam...<br /><br />Maybe a poll should be attached to each &#039;spam&#039; message? Then, if enough people are brave (silly?) enough <br />to test it, and it turns out to be legit, there may be a valid reason to call it something other than spam?<br />Maybe a&nbsp; &quot;Special offers&quot; or &quot;Limited Time/Qty&quot; section could be created for posts that &#039;pass&#039;<br /><br />Of course, administration of the voting would be difficult, it&#039;s easy enough to fake an account and vote for your own scams!<br />Perhaps 5 posts before you can vote? 10 posts? Member for 30 days? Restrict such posts to vendors with proven reputations?<br /><br />One post (elsewhere) 6-8 months ago promised massive discounts to the first 10 buyers who FE&#039;d coz the vendor was hard up. <br />Vendor wanted a PM from you, then created private listings for those interested...I believe people got what they ordered, and at a very good price.<br /><br />IMHO most scam spam is easy to spot, eg $10 for a btc when the biggest trader out there is around $70 - well I&#039;d love to believe that one, but c&#039;mon!!!<br />How stoned do these guys think we are!
