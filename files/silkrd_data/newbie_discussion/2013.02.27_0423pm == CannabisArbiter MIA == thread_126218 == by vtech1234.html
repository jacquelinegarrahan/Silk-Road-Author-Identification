				CannabisArbiter&nbsp; appears to have gone MIA. I ordered 4 days ago and finally just canceled my order. He has not logged in in 4 days and has not responded to any messages. He also recently pulled all his active listings....

				I am pissed at him right now too. I ordered from him last week and it came, but it came with NO STEALTH at ALL. I&#039;m approaching 30 orders on this site and this is the worst I&#039;ve ever seen. Literally hash and BHO in parchment, un-vacsealed and no ziplock, stuffed in a yellow padded envelope. My whole mailroom stunk of cannabis and my mailman gave me a big knowing smile. <br /><br />This is the first time this has happened to me on SR so I was going to finalize anyway and give a 3 or 4 for a review but I weighed stuff today and it was underweight too. WTF?

				At least he canceled the order. Something probably just came up, Im sure he will be back.<br /><br />@quardox I ordered a QP off him about a month ago and it came in a Medium Flat Rate Box with nothing around it. It was all in a giant vac sealed bag and dropped in a box, completely visible if looked into.

				That blows. I&#039;ve read so many good reviews of him and some of my IRL friends have used him as well with no problems. Maybe he&#039;s having a mid-life crisis or something? I&#039;m unsure how to proceed.

				Order never arrived, doesn&#039;t come up with tracking number.. Makes false allegations, outright unpleasant, unprofessional and unreasonable! He recommends himself with the following message:&nbsp; &quot;Hey SR! I am CannabisArbiter. I grew up in Southern California, and am now finishing my Chemistry degree in Northern CA. I think I could bring some really great concentrates and flowers to the menu here.&quot; This webpage is all about trust and goodwill.. well this boy &quot; CannabisArbiter &quot; or CannabisArbiter(97) as he calls himself is to my opinion the total contrary of everything this webpage ( SR ) stands for.I FEEL CHEATED, MISTRUSTED AND OUTRIGHT OFFENDED BY THIS VENDOR, ACCUSING ME OF THE FOLLOWING: &quot;Especially considering your high refund rate, it appears to me that you purposly delayed this resolution so that it would be particularly difficlut for me to find your tracking number and prove that your order was indeed sent ... and I do recall asking for your address after you requested an extention and did not receive it until just 4 days ago.&quot; ALL THIS IS UNTRUE AND RIDICULOUS. And what really offended me the most was his &quot; gipsy &quot; kind of proposal to come to a resolution by offering to resend part of the order!! I DON&#039;T CARE ABOUT MONEY, I CARE ABOUT HONESTY AND MY REPUTATION. No matter how long this man has been selling here and how positive some of his clients seem to be: SOMEONE WITH THIS TYPE OF CONDUCT SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SR AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED! <br />
