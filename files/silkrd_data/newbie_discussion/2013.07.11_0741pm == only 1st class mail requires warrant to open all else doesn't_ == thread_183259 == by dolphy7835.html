				Just read this on official usps site. Maybe i&#039;m translating it wrong, but section 4 near the top of the page seems to clearly state that only first class mail is protected by the constitution. That would seem to make priority and express open game for le with warrant or not.<br /><br />https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/contactUs/faq.aspx

				For the purposes of needing a warrant to search Priority and Express domestic have the same rules and regulations as First Class mail does.&nbsp; They cannot open it without a warrant.&nbsp; Now, if it&#039;s international mail, regardless of class they can do whatever they want.&nbsp; It&#039;s only things below First Class Mail- standard mail, periodicals, etc... that can be opened without a warrant.&nbsp; Hope this helps.

				jimcap87 is correct. <br /><br />But don&#039;t forget to never use UPS, FedEx, or any other private parcel service. They can open your packages under their own volition, I believe.<br /><br />I say this because I once received a package on SR sent via FedEx. I can tell ya I never used that vendor again!

				meta is correct.&nbsp; As public corporations UPS, FED-EX, DHL can open your packages for any reason.&nbsp; The USPS, since it&#039;s a government entity, has a much more rigid set of criteria before it opens your mail without your knowledge.&nbsp; It is surprising that the Patriot Act did not address this, but I think that based on the sheer volume of mail in addition to the smaller staffing makes it damn near impossible for them to just start opening packages at will.&nbsp; Remember that before a warrant is obtained a postal inspector (and before that a postal employee) has to show probable cause, which requires alot of paperwork and time.&nbsp; How many Post Office employees do you know that are interested in doing anything more than the absolute minimum amount of work required to keep their jobs?&nbsp; Additional paperwork, filing reports, and dealing LE are the absolute last thing your average postal worker wants to deal with.&nbsp; I will say this though, your best bet is to send everything in the small cardboard boxes as opposed to the express/priority envelopes.&nbsp; The boxes are sorted with little to no scrutiny, the envelopes are more revealing of its contents and do attract more scrutiny.
