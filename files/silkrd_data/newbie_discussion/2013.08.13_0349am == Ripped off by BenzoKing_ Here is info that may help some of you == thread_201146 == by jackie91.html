				I got this advice from an SR vet when I told them BK ripped me off. I am calling Vanilla tomorrow and see if it helps. This would also apply to MoneyPaks and other reload cards. Nothing to lose by trying.<br /><br />&quot;My suggestion is to get in touch with Vanilla and let them know that the card was stolen and have them put a freeze on whatever account it was loaded to. If there are any available funds on his account, you may be entitled to reimbursement. I would act quickly though because if he&#039;s scamming, he probably pulls money off the card at ATMs so that he has the cash before anyone can freeze it up. Even if there are no funds in his account to retrieve, he won&#039;t be able to load that account anymore since it will be flagged...this will help any potential future victims. Most people are intimidated by this process because sometimes they require ID...but they&#039;re not going to investigate you or anything...they just want proof that you are the rightful owner... they may also ask you to provide the receipt from when you purchased the Vanilla as well as zip code where it was purchased.&quot;

				Like I said...BoA isn&#039;t going to do anything for you. They have no dog in this fight. They aren&#039;t responsible for him, you or me. They just passed the money along, they have no liability in something like this. I can tell you right now they are going to say there is nothing they can do, it&#039;s not their problem, they are just the middleman. <br /><br />I guarantee that&#039;s what they will tell you. <br /><br />I am going to PM you to get that info though.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So... you stole $50,000 from SR users who trusted you to do the right thing and act honourably? And you did this because one customer of yours was compromised? Now you&#039;re posting here for, what, kicks, sympathy?&nbsp; :-\
