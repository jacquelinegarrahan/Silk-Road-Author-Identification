				I&#039;m an old man lost in a sea of bitcoins in cyberspace. I was introduced to SR about 4 days ago. I was just amazed. I could not wait to purchase something off this site. So I went straight to a bitcoin dealer and the company&#039;s name was BtcQuick. After purchasing a single coin I found that my private key to my coin did not seem to work, it said that it was invalid. I went back to btc and it no longer showed that i had my coin even though it says purchase confirmed. I have now spent three days trying to get this coin. I have called the company numerous times trying to resolve the issue and they said that they were no longer responsible for what ever happened to the coin. I now have $125.00 somewhere in cyberspace that I cannot get to. If there is anyone who has done business with btc or have any advice on what I&#039;m supposed to do or how to get the coin to my wallet, it would be greatly appreciated.

				You should check out localbitcoins.com. Way more convenient, quicker, and more anonymous than anywhere else. Probably will seem a little sketchy at first, since you are new at this, but many of us have been using it for awhile and have had nothing but good experiences. Good Luck!
