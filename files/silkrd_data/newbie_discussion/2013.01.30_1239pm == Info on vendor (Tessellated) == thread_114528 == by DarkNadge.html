				So I&#039;m on a&nbsp; mission to find good LSD. I started of buying from a vendor called 4sale. Everything went very smoothly and the package arrived quite quickly. The product was good and gave me and some mates very intense giggles followed by some deep thinking. I got no visuals which is my Favorite bit about acid. I don&#039;t know if its just because i didn&#039;t take enough (2 150ug blotters) but the whole thing felt very mellow compared to what i remember from when i used to get acid about 4 years ago. <br /><br />After some research I&#039;m hearing very good things about the vendor Tessellated and many people seem to rate his product very well and his reviews are great. My question however isn&#039;t about the quality of his product. I have ordered some today and was wondering if any1 else who has order from the UK could tell me how long it took from making the order to receiving the product. I&#039;m not impatient but i go away next Wednesday and was kinda hoping to take the acid with me so including today i have 6 days. Is it likely that the package will get from canada to UK in 6 days?

				Hello there!<br /><br />I do not live in the UK but I live in a neighboring country which is located farther from Canada than the UK is. I have done several purchases from Canada vendors and the delivery time has been consistent every single time. It only varied by a day at most. So, yes, it could arrive within this time. The last two times it took me 8 respectively 7 days, airmail (larger order than yours). Two of these days fell over the weekend in both cases (I ordered them just before the weekend) so I am not sure if it should have been even quicker! <br /><br />I hope I helped, somehow... <br /><br />Entity

				Oh, and for the record, I have NOT ordered from Tessellated yet however I have come to the same conclusion as you have about the vendor. Therefore I have become a fan for later use, I want to do my first acid order from this guy. In other words, my words lack first hand experience with the quality of his LSD...<br /><br />I replied to you with an educated answer (I did a lot of research on him, check Avengers thread).<br /><br /><br />Entity<br /><br />

Personally, I will not order from JoR again but not because he is not a reliable vendor,<br /><br />It was shipped to a city not too far from London, it took like two weeks I believe or a bit more even, it was sent over the holidays in December though.

				Hey mate, ive been on a similar mission, Hunting down LSD on the road, and they are more expensive but you can get 300ug tabs from &quot;NeuroticNarcotic&quot; and 250s which people say are getting them tripping out their mind.&quot; EntertheMatrix&quot; is the standard front page LSD guy and seems to be really good. although i&#039;ve found a few other guys as well just by going into the LSD category and going through the first 4 or 5 pages that are highly recommended. <br /><br />has anyone tried Tyl3r Durdens ? He&#039;s a uk seller, He sells them cheaper than anyone else i have seen on the road so far, and the reviews all seem positive. Your getting 25 X 1200ug tabs for 1.26 I mean for the 300ug tabs which are meant to be super strong your paying around 6 for 5 tabs.<br />so 25 of these tabs meant to be 1200ug sounds fucking amazing to me.<br /><br />anyone got any info?&nbsp; cheers reply to this if you can so i get a notification :P

				200ug is a lot for a single blotter. I appreciate that the Avengers bring awareness to the general lack of quality LSD available, however other than the occasional test kit result which is rarely posted it would be nice to see the results of more thorough chemical analysis like gc/ms. The JoR incident is funny and interesting because the tabs were listed as being laid with a higher dose and I am not sure who ran the test, but when the results came back 56ug after everybody raved about them I just chuckled. I am not sure where they pull their numbers from, but it seems very subjective to me. However, 200ug is not unmanageable but once you move past 300ug it&#039;s a different drug. For example I was given ~400ug recently at a party and I started to perceive time moving forwards and backwards like somebody was flipping the pages of a picture book. It was more annoying at the time, although very interesting, because it was a birthday party and I was just a little too out of it to really socialize. So I think the &#039;danger&#039; in misrepresented tab strength is if you&#039;re lucky that they&#039;re not lying hold on, but more than likely they are lying and it&#039;ll skew your perspective on what LSD really is and when you do run into some really good hits have fun. LSD is nice though because once you pass these milestones you won&#039;t have a problem at that level again unless set and setting start to bother you. I am lucky that I&#039;ve always had access to real good and most importantly reasonably priced (I paid $10 for 4). The cheaper the better unless it&#039;s a random kid on the lot. There is good LSD available locally, but you need to find the right people. So go to concerts but I would avoid acts like pretty lights, bassnectar, or any big act with a young scene because a wook can smell a custy from a mile away. With the Avengers though roll the dice at least you won&#039;t get a research chemical, but don&#039;t think if you take 5 you&#039;re really eating a ten strip because when I&#039;ve had that much I couldn&#039;t move or really even think. You should get visuals with just 100ug if that&#039;s how you want to measure intensity.

				I agree Arcadia, up until recently I was able to get bomb acid just 45 min drive from my house. If I wanted to pay a little more I could get it 5 min away , same lucy, just different dealer. Then all of the sudden about two or so months ago, I buy a ten strip of &quot;the same white on white&quot; from the same person, dropped 3 hits and notice this really chemical like taste, I call dude up he assures me its lsd. Well I was tripping balls like 25 min after I took it and it was unlike any lsd I ever had. So the next day I get on the computer and research and find out its most likely an rc. Probably an nbome. Honestly the trip was cool but I prefer lucy. Ever since then the guy has had the same doses, and swears it lsd. Its fucked up, he isn&#039;t stupid, he knows what he is selling. And I&#039;ve been doing lsd for 16 years now so I kno what it feels like. Anyway I get a sheet off here for like $60 go to his house and dose him with it and tell him ill sell him a sheet of this for $150. Its the same 25i he has been selling as lucy, but about double the strength. It seems like everyone around these parts is selling rc&#039;s as lsd for outrageous prices. So lately I have been informing people that its not lsd, that its 25i-nbome they have been buying, and selling quarter sheets of the stuff for $50. I just wish that someone w ould get some good lsd for cheap again.

				tesselated&#039;s LSD does not taste of anything, and i have no doubt that it is Pure/ clean LSD, However i paid around 4 and a half BTC for 5 tabs of His LSD.<br /><br />2 days before that, I dropped some of tyl3r Durdens 25i-nbome, That isn&#039;t LSD but is similar and you can taste a chemical defo, But that is standard for nbome. <br />I paid 1-2 BTC for 25 of tyl3rs tabs. And they got me equally, If not much more trippin Than&nbsp; Tessellated&#039;s LSD.&nbsp; Now i dont think that&#039;s very fair but there you go.<br />It&#039;s a shame because i realy enjoyed the feeling i got from the LSD, I just wasnt tripping after 2 tabs. <br /><br />2 days later i dropped my last LSD tab and had no effects at all, no idea if it was due to tolerance, I had them stored correctly and everything. <br /><br /><br />The only issue in my opinion is that there hasn&#039;t been much research into Nbome yet.<br />&nbsp;

				Lol dude why would you do that.. you should wait 10 days minimum between trips on any psychedelic. 14 is the golden number. After 2 days of course you didn&#039;t feel anything

I started of buying from a vendor called 4sale. Everything went very smoothly and the package arrived quite quickly. The product was good and gave me and some mates very intense giggles followed by some deep thinking. I got no visuals which is my Favorite bit about acid. I don&#039;t know if its just because i didn&#039;t take enough (2 150ug blotters) but the whole thing felt very mellow compared to what i remember from when i used to get acid about 4 years ago. <br /><br />After some research I&#039;m hearing very good things about the vendor Tessellated and many people seem to rate his product very well and his reviews are great. My question however isn&#039;t about the quality of his product. I have ordered some today and was wondering if any1 else who has order from the UK could tell me how long it took from making the order to receiving the product. I&#039;m not impatient but i go away next Wednesday and was kinda hoping to take the acid with me so including today i have 6 days. Is it likely that the package will get from canada to UK in 6 days?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I ordered LSD from him and it just made me drowsy and give me no visuals. I&#039;m not even sure it was LSD. Complained but he&#039;s not doing much about it.<br />Great packaging but less impressed with the actual drugs and service.

				if you look at other reports on tessellated, you will see experienced user love his stuff, and occasionally somebody has some sort of an issue. the majority rules in my opinion. and as far as shipping time goes, mine was extremely quick

				My order came in well within a reasonable amount of time, Tessellated is the man! The dosage seemed to be just about right, I think. It came very stealthy, I loved that bit.
