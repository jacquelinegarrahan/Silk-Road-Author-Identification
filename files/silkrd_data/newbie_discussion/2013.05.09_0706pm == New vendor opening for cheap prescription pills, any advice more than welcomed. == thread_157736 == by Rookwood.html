				Hello fellow freedom fighters, my name is Rookwood. After much time spent researching and developing the safest plan of action, I feel I am ready to open my vendor account. I will only be selling prescription pills, mainly vicodin and klonopin, and I think I&#039;m all set having read the buyers and sellers guides as well as months spent on the forums. Is there anything you think I may have overlooked or wouldn&#039;t have come across in my research in order to become a dependable and successful part of the Silk Road community? Any tips learned the hard way or through others experiences would be invaluable to me. <br /><br />The SR being down so often lately has worried me a bit, truth be told, but I feel confident in this free market and those such as DPR and the community as a whole that, despite some bad seeds, this site is more than a site. The Silk Road is not just a place to buy and sell drugs and other frowned upon goods and services, it is the future. So, I am excited to not only be part of it, but to make some money by providing everyday people with what they desire at a low cost and in a safe and speedy manner.<br /><br />So thank you all for everything I have learned from you and for everything I hope to learn from you. I plan on selling at the lowest rate possible not just to build good feedback, but because I know the difference between profit and greed. So remember my name because I will be open for business this weekend. I just want to put my name out there and hopefully get any last minute tips and advice from all of you.<br /><br />And yes this is my first post, I don&#039;t feel the need to spam 50 useless posts because I am sure the members of The Road that are truly here to make this a better place read the noob section. At least I hope so. <br /><br />I look forward to doing business with you, so be safe, good luck and goodbye.
