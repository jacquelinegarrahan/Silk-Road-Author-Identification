				I understand you guys have been ripped off and robbed by a lot of individuals in the past but I am here to change that. I hope some of my customers come here and share their experience of my services to ease the fear you may have in ordering from me. I will be taking new customers again soon I just want to make sure all of my current customers are taken care of before taking new orders. I know anyone can talk the talk and it will take me proving myself to the community which I am doing now so in time I am sure all of you will change your mind about ordering from me. :)

				Vendor &amp; Sample Review -&nbsp; Miss Demeanor<br />Hey guys, this is my first time posting in the Meth vendors &amp; product review thread.<br />Meth isn&#039;t really my thing anymore these days but I&#039;ve done more than my fair share and I&#039;ve found a different poison in the last couple of years and this was the first time I used ice in nearly two years. But as I said I know the difference between sub-standard and top shelf product and this stuff is as nice as it comes, some straight up Heisenberg shit! But it&#039;s not just that, the service and communication is second to none and it&#039;s just as A-class as her product itself..<br /><br />Communication:<br />Initially I messaged MD just to inquire about a few different things and I got a response within half an hour. We started messaging each other back and forth and she asked me if I was interested in a sample in exchange for a review. I basically regard samples as dry run to see if any future international orders with the vendor will make it successfully into my country and I also get to sample the product at the same time! Killing two birds with the one stone so to speak. Anyway needless to say all responses to any of personal messages that I sent her were answered within an hour max (if she&#039;s online at that time) and the longest I ever had to wait for a reply to my messages would be about 12 hours due to the time difference between her and I. But I must enforce that this only occurred twice and as I said it&#039;s due to the time differences between the two of us.<br /><br />Shipping &amp; Stealth:<br />Without giving anything away about how MD&#039;s products are concealed when packaged I can safely vouch for her ingenuity. Very smart and simple and that&#039;s all I&#039;ll say. It got here safe and sound plus it made it past the most Gestapo of all of Customs so that says alot for the quality of the stealth on it&#039;s own.<br /><br />Product Quality:<br />Ok as I said I don&#039;t use this stuff at all anymore so I have zero tolerance to any amphetamines of any type. Well because I don&#039;t use this stuff any more I wasn&#039;t prepared to go hunting down a meth pipe from a friend and I certainly wasn&#039;t going to purchase one just for this one experience. The product arrived crushed for obvious reasons but still had alot of distinct ultra-clear chunks scattered throughout it. It wasn&#039;t oily or wet in any way at all, it just looked like smashed up glass in a bag.<br />I weighed 50mg and prepared it for IV administration but decided to go halves with my friend due to the amount of time it&#039;s been since we both last used ice together. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t have any more than 25mg because it was just enough to do me really nicely!! It came on really cleanly very smooth!!<br />And I can attest to the fact that it&#039;s everything that it&#039;s advertised as being. Easily the cleanest Methamphetamine I&#039;ve EVER encountered in my life and I&#039;ve used a hell of a lot in my time! There was no nasty come down and feeling &quot;scattered out&quot;, no grinding my teeth however I did experience a subtle jaw-clenching and I was easily able to get to sleep VERY comfortably at about 7am the next morning. This stuff is what I would definitely describe as &quot;Pharmaceutical Grade Meth&quot; because it&#039;s honestly about as clean as it comes.<br />I gave a bit to a couple of friends who smoke it just to see how well it burnt and re-crystallized and this is some full &quot;back in the day shit&quot;. It&#039;s been about 10 years since I&#039;ve seen stuff like this. You can put just a few tiny grains in the pipe and easily get an average of 8 big tokes on it. So 100mg go&#039;s a long, long way just as it should. We haven&#039;t seen meth like this in years in this country.<br /><br />Alot people say that they&#039;ve found their &quot;go to guy&quot; (or girl in this instance) but I&#039;ve honestly got absolutely no reason what so ever to look elsewhere. Not one! No one can fuck with Miss Demeanor at all! Not even close. And anyone calling her a &quot;scammer&quot; seriously has their heads lodged heavily up their own ass. You&#039;ll be honestly really hard-pressed to find another vendor in the same league as MD.<br /><br />Thanks for the great night MD! You were right, I did owe it to myself to try this out. Now I know what you meant!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				It appears some people owe you an apology for calling scammer prematurely. Do some homework on a vendor by reading around the forums guys!! Not having a go at anyone here but she&#039;s as legit as they come. <br /><br />And you can apply for escrow through her listings anyway so what are you sweating over? Either way, everything about her is legit. All the claims on her profile are true based on my experience and those that I shared the sample with.<br /><br />You wont find many vendors like this guys.

				thanks for the review p1klz and nicely written.&nbsp; I have also exchanged communications with MD and found the same prompt responses etc.&nbsp; I also think the way MD handled this thread was very professional.&nbsp; I agree that there was definitely some premature terms thrown around in here which actually prompted me to contact Miss for myself.&nbsp; I can&#039;t attest to the quality of product or any other areas of MD&#039;s business yet so having the first Aus review come through is appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				No one has seen anything yet so there will be no apology just yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing other than a sample of meth has any feedback yet but there is $100,000 in FE so we will soon see.

				Holy shit! It fucking sucks to see how many of you guys have been fucked over here!! That &#039;importer&#039; cunt screamed scam from day one to me.<br />It seems that the meth scene on SR is rife with scamming vendors and by the sounds of it (and going off all my past experiences here) it seems like you can trust the Heroin vendors here a thousand times more than you can trust some of these shithead, scamming &quot;Meth Vendors&quot;. I&#039;m not advocating people switch to Heroin at all ok? It&#039;s just considering how much us Heroin users are stigmatized &quot;scum of the earth who you should never trust&quot; it seems like they&#039;re light-years ahead of some these fuckwits who represent the those of you who like to indulge in the crystal. <br /><br />No wonder why you guys have your guard up in regard to Miss Demeanor and any other Meth vendors you haven&#039;t done business with previously that you know you can trust. Especially any vendor asking for you to FE. And I also appreciate the fact that sending out a 0.25g sample can&#039;t be compared to waiting on an ounce to arrive that you&#039;ve already finalized on. <br />And yeah, I also know alot of vendors send out samples in order to reel you in to buying from them and when you do you&#039;re then asked to FE in order to keep inventory stocked up, at which point they even offer you extra product in exchange to get you to agree to FE. So you go along with it and then BAM! You&#039;ve just been fucked out of x amount of bitcoins.<br /><br />But also in MD&#039;s defence (which I think I mentioned in my review) you can apply for escrow on her vendor page. <br /><br />Also in my experience scammers don&#039;t go to the effort of keeping in constant communication you with you even after they&#039;ve got your money. I&#039;ve been scammed twice here and both times correspondence ceased the moment they&#039;ve got their money.<br /><br />Anyway best of luck guys. And for anyone who went through MD, I hope you get your orders as soon as possible. <br /><br />Just so you guys get an idea of how long it took for my order to be processed and shipped then finalized on delivery I&#039;ve pasted my transaction stats below. Hope it helps you get an idea of when your orders should arrive. <br /><br />ordered: July 28, 2013, 10:25 am UTC<br />shipped: July 29, 2013, 9:03 pm UTC<br />finalized: August 8, 2013, 9:15 am UTC<br /><br />Take it easy guys. Peace.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t believe an apology is necessary.<br />As many times as you guys have been ripped off I don&#039;t blame you to be cautious.<br />I am doing my best to provide escrow orders as well as non escrow.<br />Just know I offered .11 listing up to 28G listing I never forced anyone to order large orders in fact I gave the advice to start small and move up.<br />When you ask me to escrow I always said we can start small and move up.<br />$100,000 in escrow is way off but I get what your saying and I know people can talk the talk but I am here to prove myself but don&#039;t forget the risk I am taking and the service I am providing. I am here to get you guys clean and I mean the cleanest product possible for a reasonable price. Believe me I am not making much of a profit here after exchange fees and silkroad fees some transactions I have lost money. I don&#039;t plan on raising my prices either so don&#039;t worry. Hell I even went into the Australian thread and gave I don&#039;t even know how many free samples away. I think this thread is a great official review thread for me. I will link to it in my profile. Please report here when you receive your orders. Thanks!&nbsp; :D

				I may be a newbie to the forum but not the road.&nbsp; My buyer stats included below.<br /><br />MD, this is not targeted at you, so I hope you are not insulted or take my feedback personally.&nbsp; I will offer my humble apologies if you truly are one of very few ligit and trust worthy sellers that will ship quality ICE to AU. I have a good buying track record and many(15+) successful International orders.&nbsp; I have a very efficient and safe method for delivery &amp; receiving.&nbsp; I have successfully received a few orders from the US, and more from other countries.&nbsp; Unfortunately the last 3/4 have gone wrong so now I am somewhat uncomfortable having to FE for international orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />From my experiences warning signs to look out for:<br /><br />- Insist on FE<br /><br />- Customer reviews will often indicate that seller has not specialized in the product and/or Australia. But the seller will have over 100 transactions, almost all successful and generally 6+ months on SR<br /><br />- Seller is very quick to response pre-sale and payment, slows down after sale but still not too bad.&nbsp; Then as you get closer to when you should have received your package they take long and longer.&nbsp; And the danger is you hold on on doing anything because you get worried the seller might not send at all.<br /><br />- Seller is generally slow to get orders out because this buys time because the scam is over when the first or more people reach a point that doubts turn into complaints, reports to SR and forum postings.<br /><br />- Seller will refuse to provide tracking info or send using a service that does even if you are willing to pay.&nbsp; Until recently I only had package go missing, but the sell had provided express tracking, and it was easy to see where the package stopped and it was in Australia, and customs had not intercepted, issue was that there was no customs forms that should be included with any international package.&nbsp; I was able to get info from an unnamed source and the package is stuck because there is no channel back to sender for them to resolve the issue. Nothing to do with customs.<br /><br />- Don&#039;t be fooled by seeing a seller was be a vendor for 6+ months.&nbsp; There trend for dormant vendors to sell their account with 1+ years on the road for a negotiable fee.&nbsp; I have nothing against sellers having the opportunity to sell their business as a going concern, just don&#039;t like the idea of this being used for scams.<br /><br />- The other signs are claims that tracking would require them or you to sign for the package. This is true for Couriers, USPS Express and above.&nbsp; But USPS first class and/or priority, no signature is required.&nbsp; It works similar to Australia Post where the seller can print the parcel labels and customs forms.&nbsp; They do a normal mail drop, but they have basic tracking.&nbsp; Tracking that will at least confirm the package was sent, and the date it leaves America.&nbsp; Unfortunately after that point, you just wait, but from my experience it will only take 2-5 business days after leaving LA.&nbsp; Better than nothing and shows the seller is not just a complete scam artist.<br /><br />- Selling and getting good reviews on a few smaller deals or even, creating profiles and adding some reviews form purchases done themselves.&nbsp; Just think it only costs the 6% SR fee as they are paying the cash back to themselves.<br /><br />I have 2 x 1/2 Ozs ordered from Miss Demeanour and very much hoping that even though MD exhibited several of the characteristics listed above, I will be very happy to eat my words, and MD if your reading I promise to send you back a special treat to show my appreciation :)&nbsp; <br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Member for: 3 months<br /><br />total transactions&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 month&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all time<br />total spent&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$9,093.60 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$30,240.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$34,793.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$34,793.00<br />refund rate&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1%<br />auto-finalize rate&nbsp; &nbsp; 0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0%<br />

				Wow, didnt realize people were scammin aussies so much but I can understand how. Pretty fucked up, and wow $100,000ish in escrow, not making any accusations but that would be a damn crazy scam. I could see some greedy people taking it in a heartbeat in this world. Still good luck to everyone who ordered. I would send NBOMe blotters to AUS in form of personal letters in envelopes. They are being made currently though. Also, as drug dogs cannot detect ketamine I may look into successfully delivering that to AUS in the future.

				Miss Demeanor (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/a38c8b64ce)is currently in stealth mode and unfortunately (or maybe conveniently ???) you can&#039;t see her stats and also there is not &quot;discussion&quot; on her page so if &#039;she&quot; is a scammer she&#039;s going it about it the smartest way possible. I don&#039;t know why she requires people to FE. They apparently are manufacturing the product themselves and have an endless supply according to MD so the time honoured &quot;I need to keep my product in stock and can&#039;t tie my money up in escrow&quot; excuse doesn&#039;t really fly in this instance if you ask me. Just saying. ???<br /><br />It&#039;s not looking good, I hope I&#039;m wrong. If I am I will eat my words and apologise to MD. I got sent a free 0.25g sample about a month ago but I want to know if ANYONE has got their orders in as there are next to no reviews on her profile..

				Hiya Guys. Yesterday I received my 2nd package from Miss Demeanor she is not a scammer.<br /><br />For anyone who was there when MD first began shipping almost exclusively to OZ I foolishly after waiting only a week was the first to call her a scammer (SR Acc: Forsaknlife). Swarms of scammer posts ensued and MD took down her page saying she could not deal with these people hurting her reputation and profits etc. MD cancelled my Escrow order for 1 gram and told me that when ever the package arrived it was mine to keep and Free. She was apparently done with SR. Low and behold I received my package and was impressed by all 3 attributes (Speed, Stealth, Product). I was so amazed that I messaged her and thanked her. I even put in another order not 1 day later. 15 days later (Paid for the slow shipping) I received my 2nd package, Just as great stealth and product.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t want to jump the gun as I have done in the past. I honestly think MD will come through for everyone. She is a good vendor and she won&#039;t stick around again if people have nothing but stupid and incorrect information and want to spread it.<br /><br />Regards<br />Forsaknlife

I don&#039;t mean to cause any offense when I say that although you&#039;ve received your packages there were still qutie alot of other customers on her &#039;discussion&#039; page that were claiming that their packages still hadn&#039;t arrived.

I hope there&#039;s alot of new happy customers out there. But if there are they&#039;re pretty fucking lazy in the way of leaving feedback here of on the forums. Speaking of feedback, is it possible to display your feedback in stealth mode? Or even just the &#039;discussion&#039; link on your vendor page?

				It&#039;s slightly fishy how MD&#039;s info previously mentioned tracking I.D&#039;s being withheld unless a problem with delivery, but the updated listing (conveniently removed) offered distribution of tracking I.D&#039;s without a problem. That don&#039;t make sense as most vendor&#039;s who believe not to give out I.D&#039;s will keep it that way! <br />No reply to messages in over 48hrs either...

				&nbsp; I put this post up over a month ago to watch out for this bloke and i copped an ear bashing for it .&nbsp; And to my amazement you lot kept loading his pockets big time.&nbsp; For the little bit that was sent out cost him at most a couple of grand and i reckon you lot just handed over about 200k to him. and half of that was after my warning .&nbsp; &nbsp;You have to wonder about some people.

Yesterday I received my 2nd package from Miss Demeanor she is not a scammer.<br /><br />For anyone who was there when MD first began shipping almost exclusively to OZ I foolishly after waiting only a week was the first to call her a scammer (SR Acc: Forsaknlife). Swarms of scammer posts ensued and MD took down her page saying she could not deal with these people hurting her reputation and profits etc. MD cancelled my Escrow order for 1 gram and told me that when ever the package arrived it was mine to keep and Free. She was apparently done with SR. Low and behold I received my package and was impressed by all 3 attributes (Speed, Stealth, Product). I was so amazed that I messaged her and thanked her. I even put in another order not 1 day later. 15 days later (Paid for the slow shipping) I received my 2nd package, Just as great stealth and product.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t want to jump the gun as I have done in the past. I honestly think MD will come through for everyone. She is a good vendor and she won&#039;t stick around again if people have nothing but stupid and incorrect information and want to spread it.<br /><br />Regards<br />Forsaknlife<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow! Ok thanks a bunch mate. I saw that there was some feedback stating that their second 7 gram package had succesfully arrived. So am I safe to assume that was you? I don&#039;t mean to cause any offense when I say that although you&#039;ve received your packages there were still qutie alot of other customers on her &#039;discussion&#039; page that were claiming that their packages still hadn&#039;t arrived. I don&#039;t know how this has panned out and whether or not these people got their packages but I was hoping tha alot more people would have cane online to clear the air once and for all. <br /><br />Once I hear of another few customers coming forth with some positive news then I&#039;ll eat my words as promised with my prior post. I really hope she&#039;s as solid as you say because the sample that she sent me was the fucking bomb! I just can&#039;t afford to FE on any puchase only to get screwed. The only time I&#039;ve ever been comfortable with FE&#039;ing on a purchase is after I&#039;ve built a good rapport with the said vendor after AT LEAST five or so transactions in escrow first.<br /><br />Sorry MD if you&#039;re legit but you should understand that we&#039;ve been fucked over too many times in the past and when things seem too good to be true then they generally are. I hope there&#039;s alot of new happy customers out there. But if there are they&#039;re pretty fucking lazy in the way of leaving feedback here of on the forums. Speaking of feedback, is it possible to display your feedback in stealth mode? Or even just the &#039;discussion&#039; link on your vendor page? Anyways I hope you&#039;ve settled the minds of the skeptics out there by now.<br /><br />Take it easy guys..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>4sakn is your 2nd account p1klz? or is it just a coincidence that you both have 5 letter name with number in it?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is this cunt serious? Is that honestly even a real question? And you seriously basing this water-tight theory of your&#039;s around the fact that my nick contains 5 letters aswell as this 4sakn fella? LOL!! Fuck me you ice heads are a paranoid bunch. Get some fucking sleep idiot. <br /><br />Anyone who takes or even has the time to go through the ordeal of posting another 50 posts for a second time in order to post under a spoof account is a fucking loser.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that Miss Demeanor&#039;s feedback has plummited to 3.9 over the last few days and that &#039;she&#039; has gone conveniently into stealth mode so her negative feedback can&#039;t be seen by the public. <br /><br />Glad I wasn&#039;t foolish enough to commit to an order through her. I thought it was fishy the second she cancelled all of those escrow orders a few weeks back, you know, the ones that got sent out and were on the house when she &quot;quit&quot; due to all the people calling scammer?<br /><br />I do however feel sorry for those of you guys that did go out on a limb with this scammer and got butt-fucked out thousands and thousands.<br />

				She still had a 5.0, but I gave her 1 and a good verbal rheeming. After thinking about it for a bit , I reckon this slut is fucken no other than INFINITE SOURCE! He&#039;s bitter as fuck at being banned for scamming, he loves to target Aussies <br /><br />If you go back a ways through the meth vendors thread he makes a comment something like<br />&#039; It&#039;s a bit hard to be pissed off when I just cleared 7 grand today because I discovered Aussie love meth&#039;.<br /><br />He&#039;s listings on Atlantis have sold fuck all, and I&#039;m pretty sure a cunt who spent as much time on here as he did wouldn&#039;t have a fucking job. So what else would a scumbag scamming fuck loser like that do? Pretend to be a chick and target where he knows will be rich pickings.- Bet the cunt dresses like a bitch too just to get into character
