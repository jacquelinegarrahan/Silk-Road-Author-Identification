				Qd is in stealth mode and all her page says is &quot;please wrap it up.&quot;&nbsp; Plus Chembros pulled all their listings.&nbsp; Im worried about my order with qd8714... hopefully it will arrive tomorrow, but no response to my messages.&nbsp; Anyone else ordered recently from either vendor?

				ok yeah, placed an order early monday, marked in transit wednesday. also, hasnt read any of my messages. <br /><br />BUT it looks like chembros listings are back up, which is somewhat a relief since i&#039;ve heard they work together<br /><br />also, chembros&#039; listings say he has new management and one of his listings says hes backed by qd8714, which is odd. i would expect vice versa, qd8714 to be backed by chembros&nbsp; ???<br /><br />in my opinion and from what i&#039;ve read and what i&#039;ve seen i wouldn&#039;t be too surprised to learn that qd8714 abuses her products just like us, her misspellings/typos are a talltale sign of mdpv use (at least from my experience in high dosages, loss of fine motor skills)<br /><br />but hey, i&#039;m not here to judge, just want to give some insight, i hope my goodies come too.<br /><br />

				A month ago I ordered a g and a scale from Chembros, both showed in transit the next day. The g showed in 3-4 days. Was great. The scale is mia, after 2 weeks he said he would send more pv instead, he had .01 scales not .001 scales, not that he shipped the .01 like he said he did. Thats what &quot;in transit&quot; means right? 4 days after he said he would substitute pv he pm&#039;ed me and said he got the right scales in and asked for my address. I sent it, he didn&#039;t&nbsp; read the message with my address after 8 days, went to resolution and he&#039;s saying he shipped it, Don&#039;t really know how without the address he said he didn&#039;t have and didn&#039;t read when I resent it. He offered 50% and asked for my address for a third time said he&#039;d look into it/reship. How can he look into it with my address, shouldn&#039;t be possible. He&#039;s keeping address info of orders to &quot;look into&quot;? Scary shit. I don&#039;t ever expect to see the scale. He&#039;ll probably get 50% of it out of resolution. Same scales are up on amazon for half the price, just thought it was convenient, oops. <br /><br />Last Sunday I ordered PV from qd instead, paid for priority/DCN, was marked shipped Monday, wasn&#039;t here on Saturday. I pm&#039;d her asking if it shipped. If I could get dcn number or if she knew about when it should get here. She wrote back, &quot;this sucks&quot; nothing else. This sucks what? Who knows..... LE? She ran out? Forgot to send it? Dog died? Sucks for me for sure. Package that should take 2-3 days that I&#039;m still waiting for after a week sucks really bad. Right now between the two of them I&#039;m out 90 bucks and stuck waiting to get half it back. I wish j1m1th1ng had his listings up a week ago, his white shit is just as good, or better. Customer service was way better, Ships quick too.

				Same thing ordered from QD....never came.. She replied to all my text 9 days later asking for my address and I gave it to her.&nbsp; She never read it.&nbsp; Now early this morning&nbsp; Chembros asked me what it was and they would &quot;reship&quot; (like it was even shipped in the first place), so I sent them a message back right away, which was 9 hours ago and they still haven&#039;t read it, so I know they didn&#039;t ship out my order today....<br /><br />Now Chembros is in stealth mode and&nbsp; all of QDs listings are taken down.<br /><br />Shagstar, why are you only expecting half back?&nbsp; Don&#039;t they have to prove they shipped it you?

				QD logged in sometime today, had to to remove the listings. Didn&#039;t bother reading messages. Why sell something and not ship then pull all the listings, reply with &quot;this sucks&quot; when I asked where it went? DCN&#039;s are easy to fake, all it proves is something was delivered to this zip code. Empty envelope to a random address will give you that for about a buck. I&#039;ve never had a priority package take more then a week, guessing it&#039;s gone. With chembros there&#039;s no dcn that I know of. From reading other posts, it&#039;s his word vs mine, we each get 50%. I did get a message from chembros saying he shipped it again today, 4th time now. I don&#039;t have much faith.

				Yeah your right about them sending an empty package or junk mail to your destination so they can say they fulfilled their end of the deal.&nbsp; I think that because, the first time I ordered from&nbsp; QD8714 the weirdest piece of junk mail ended up in my mailbox 2 or 3 days later.&nbsp; It was in this weird black plastic material but normal size letter envelope with a sticker on it from customs.&nbsp; I figured it had to be from her but when I opened it all that was in there was this weird postcard/advertisement for some Korean clothing website and on the back it was all in Russian for a Russian fashion website.&nbsp; So I pm&#039;ed QD asking her if that is what she sent and if so there was nothing in it and Im not stupid and going to be scammed, but if it is not the package you marked &quot;in transit&quot; I apologize.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; I asked my next door neighbor/friend to check his mail to see if he got the same junkmail and he didn&#039;t.&nbsp; So she messaged me back and said &quot;send me address and Ill check&quot; So I messaged her my address, which she never read!&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the packaged did end up coming 3 days later.<br />Now with my second order that was ordered 12 days ago the same thing happened or similar.&nbsp; After 3 days of being marked in transit I go out to my mailbox and see a weird piece a mail by itself and Im thinking &quot;hell yeah, this is it!&quot; until I open it and see it is a postcard like flyer ad for a residential landscaping company that doesn&#039;t even do work in my state! And the address was handwritten!&nbsp; <br />Its just so mysterious, why go in stealth mode though if you plan on scamming a bunch of people and closing shop?&nbsp; Well, now QD has completely pulled her listings, and Chembros are in stealth mode.<br />Id forgive and Forget, if Chembros had actually mailed my packaged for QD yesterday like they said, but they still have not read my messages so there is no way they could have mailed it.&nbsp; I have the chance to resolve in 5 hours so we will see, but surely you and I are not the only ones this has happened to; and the SR admin are not pretty smart, so I think they will see what is really going on, plus I have 14 or 15 transactions with no problems, so we will see.

				I didn&#039;t get fake letter yet, It doesn&#039;t have to go to your address to say delivered, google the walmart in the same zip, send it there, dcn says delivered to the right zip proving it was delivered to that zip code, nothing more. Looks like other people are getting their stuff, must be bad karma or something. I don&#039;t want a refund, looks bad in my stats. I still have hope in them, a little anyway.

				Over a month waiting on a scale now, gave a big extension because I didn&#039;t want a refund. It&#039;s in resolution. He want&#039;s 50%, somehow he thinks he shipped to me here 4 times now? To his credit the gram ordered at the same time showed up in 3-4 days. QD 2 weeks on a priority package, did say she would reship. With DNC that doesn&#039;t make sense to me. It goes to resolution soon. Never had trouble with my mail. Just doesn&#039;t happen, I&#039;m friends with my mail man.

				Anyone who didn&#039;t get their orders of MDPV from , chembros and qd8714.&nbsp; Should feel free to contact me on the main site for a free sample of my MDPV.&nbsp; If I suspect you not one of the people they scammed I may ask for a screen shot or something.&nbsp; If you got cheated by these guys come get a sample of some high quality MDPV from a vendor you can trust.&nbsp;
