				So I finally get my security, bitcoins, vendor account, packaging, and so on set up for the SR experience. This comes after a couple months of research ...What a pain in the ass lol.<br /><br />About me, I&#039;m a small grower and will be selling a few extra lbs (not under this forum name) of what I think is great smoke to the SR community. Anyway, before selling I decide I&#039;m going to sample some products from top current vendors thinking I will learn some valuable information.&nbsp; Also my grower ego is uncontrollable and I want to compare my own product with these &quot;top&#039; sellers. Back to the story, I search and search and find a nice offering and place an order for a small amount from a &quot;top&quot; vendor with my buyer account (not my vendor account) that has zero transactions. I send a very nice message/drop address in GPG and no reply at all. Hmm, oh well no worries they are probably busy and&nbsp; I do see the very next morning it is marked &quot;in transit&quot;. This SR system is great I think to myself!<br /><br />After 4 days I start to wonder hmmm. Now this vendor is also from the US so I&#039;m thinking 4 day delivery would be about the slowest from my drop location and still no message or reply from him yet. I keep the faith though, rock on SR wahoo!<br /><br />Now it&#039;s&nbsp; been 8 days since my order was placed *grabs little baby and swings violently*.&nbsp; WTF! The dollars for the order mean nothing, seriously nothing, for me but it dampens my enthusiasm for SR and this pisses me off.<br /><br />Well maybe it&#039;s a crappy drop location you say? I used a real person, real location, who has never ever had any trouble with mail service and does receive similar non drug packages frequently. <br /><br />What else could it be? Slow mail service. Again very possible but unlikely with a small order like this one and all of my experience with US mail service from other states. Like I mentioned above, slow to me would be 4-5 days max. I could be wrong though who knows.<br /><br />Well maybe it&#039;s a lost package? It&#039;s possible but I&#039;ve used the US mail for the last 30 years for a business and have not had one yet. Maybe I&#039;m just lucky.<br /><br />What else? As a vendor it recommends that when an order is placed you do not process it until you have put it in the mail. I know this because I have sold one transaction with a friend who bought a listing from me for testing purposes before going back in stealth mode. I&#039;m hoping this was not done and my &quot;in transit&quot; doesn&#039;t mean the vendor just saw the order and pushed go.<br /><br />Scam? I&#039;ve read some sellers selectively scam people with little or no transaction history. It almost seems the norm as new buyers are deemed guilty until they prove themselves innocent. This mentally would makes it easier for this to take place and I&#039;m sure there are some deadbeats out there.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing this was a good lesson to reinforce how bad practices and no communication can piss off buyers. I bummed as I was already hoping to have finalized and placed another order with a top vendor now but I&#039;m not going to have multiples going to this drop location until this is resolved, first order and looks like I&#039;m going into resolution haha.<br /><br />Lesson for noobs, send a message to a vendor BEFORE you buy and if he doesn&#039;t reply stay away! Don&#039;t feel inferior as a noob buyer just look for an exceptional seller who plays it straight and then be loyal to him. If this treatment is the norm for new buyers, I&#039;m going to sell out my extra in no time once I get rolling. I have it burned into my brain now so I don&#039;t forget in a year - treat noobs with respect/great service - they could be a fantastic buyer for you some day.<br /><br />

				I feel for you man. It wasn&#039;t so bad when I joined and made my first order. Didn&#039;t even hear about finalising early til quite a bit later.
