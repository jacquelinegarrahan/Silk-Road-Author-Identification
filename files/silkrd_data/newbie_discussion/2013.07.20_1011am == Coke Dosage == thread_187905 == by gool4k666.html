				I have a fair bit of experience with coke (having spent a fair bit of time in Sth America in the past).<br /><br />Key points are:<br />&nbsp;- You don&#039;t know what &#039;your&#039; dose is until you test out yourself.&nbsp; My advice is that everyone is different, and most batches of coke are different (excluding those which you have purchased which come from the same brick).<br />&nbsp;- Start small, and be prepared to use some of it to work out what is good for you (i&#039;ve seen some people break a gram into 8 lines, whereas others may get 20 out of one gram and still get a similar effect)<br />&nbsp;- Buy from the same people so you know the quality is good<br /><br />In my experience a set of 4 small lines taken 2 x 2 is a good way to get more in, and prolong the effect, rather than doing 2 big ones!<br /><br />Bottom line - some of that gram you&#039;ve bought should be viewed as &#039;calibrator&#039; material, no matter what your level of &#039;experience&#039;<br /><br />Can&#039;t say much about speed comedowns, but unless you&#039;ve worked through 2g+ in a night, there isn&#039;t too much of a comedown on coke...<br />

				Thanks Intraterrestrial<br /><br />I would take the speed only when i come down from coke and want to reserve it for other occasions. Of Course the coke is still in my organism but i wouldn&#039;t feel good.<br />I read that small doses are ok.

				I love me some coke BUT because every dealer is different, I always do a small line at first(about the size of a match) and wait about an hour just to make sure it doesn&#039;t give me a bad reaction. I think it&#039;s good with any drug to start small just to be safe. I can make 1g last about a week if I go really easy on it but it usually lasts me 3-4 days, if that. I&#039;ve OD&#039;d on it though so i&#039;m really cautious now. OD&#039;ing is horrible so just be careful.

				Dude, coke will f&#039; up your life!&nbsp; A small skinny line is your standard starting dose.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t get carried away with it.&nbsp; We consider it an &quot;evil drug&quot; and it will rob you of your mind, body, and soul!&nbsp; I may sugguest to smoke buds instead or get yourself some Adderall prescribed.&nbsp; Adderall is better and longer lasting swallowed than snorted, as snorting will clog your nose with the pills fillers.

				And make sure to crush it finally with a hand sanitizer cleaned dried quarter coin face, use a clean straw, straight razor blade, and surface.&nbsp; Don&#039;t screw yourself up as one who takes coke only wants more of the drug.&nbsp; Everything else in the users life is neglected to the point of possible ruin.

				I&#039;ve been into a coke for about a half year now.&nbsp; When I just bought a new bag of it, I usually start with a small line that is about 1 inch long and maybe an eighth of an inch thick.&nbsp; After that I wait about a half hour to see how I feel. If I feel alright after that I start doing lines that are about ~1.5-2 inches long for the night.<br /><br />I mostly use my credit card to crush and a $ bill to snort it, but a clean utility razor is preferred :p<br /><br />This is usually at parties, and I try to not take more than one line in 30-45 minutes<br /><br />I also bought a cocaine cut test from ezTest as I want to avoid coke that is cut with levamisole
