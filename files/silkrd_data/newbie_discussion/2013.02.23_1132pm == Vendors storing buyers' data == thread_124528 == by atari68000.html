				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR but so far it looks to me like it can provide a lot of safety when taking care of certain security measures.<br /><br />One thing I wonder about is the possibility that a vendor would store my data for whatever reason, so that it could be found if he gets busted. Of course no vendor would admit that, but how do other buyers estimate that possibility? Or maybe there&#039;s anyone who encountered some signs for that, like during correspondence a vendor seems to &#039;remember&#039; too much.<br />Personally it seems to me that most sellers care a lot about safety and I would estimate the chances of them storing buyers&#039; information (especially unencrypted) to be quite low, but I&#039;m curious about people&#039;s opinions/experiences.<br />

				Yes I do agree with you! If a vendors are keeping information about closed purchases is a security risk not just for the buyer. Because If they are ever discovered by an adversary it is evidance of the extent of their activities.<br /><br />So we can only trust that sellers for their own safety do not store these sensative details.

				A friend of mine ordered some hash from a popular UK seller. About a week after the order arrived he was surprised to find another package arrive in the post, which contained exactly the same product and weight as the first package. He didn&#039;t order it twice, so the seller must have stored his name, address, and order, and accidentally reprocessed it.

				I would hope that if they are stored it is as the encrypted text, though I would prefer they were not stored after transaction is concluded.<br /><br />I would presume they are kept in the interim though... Right now I am in discussions with a vendor who is claiming an incorrect address and refusing a partial refund. How could they verify an incorrect address without keeping it?

				This has been a concern of mine also, we take such care to remain anonymous and this is the weak link.&nbsp; The good news is that if you are just buying personal use levels of product, I highly doubt you will be subject to a serious money costing investigation if your info is found.&nbsp; It would have to be found co-located with what you bought and etc to be evidence at all.&nbsp; A contact list of names is not evidence of anything, everyone has them.&nbsp; And I am not sure but I would believe that law enforcement is interested in getting the bigger fish, meaning who is wholesaling to this dealer that was busted.&nbsp; They really don&#039;t have time to prosecute every user, they want to bust the manufacturer.<br /><br />All this could be incorrect, just thinking out loud!!!!

				I believe it&#039;s a requirement for sellers to destroy the address as soon as they have used it, so anyone not doing so is violating the terms of having a seller account (as far as I can remember anyway - I think the rules are on the &quot;become a seller&quot; link on your account page.) It shouldn&#039;t be a problem, but a few posts on here and my friend&#039;s experience suggests it may become one. I guess the only solution is to choose your vendors carefully.

				Storing buyers information is against SR rules and should not be done under any circumstances.<br /><br />There has been however occasional cases where this has happened which is why you should only ever send identifiable information encrypted using PGP. This of course would not stop a vendor keeping your encrypted details stored somewhere but at least they could not be read by anyone else unless the vendor gave up their passwords etc. <br /><br />To ensure the maximum level of safety you should try to only use anonymous drops that are in no way linked to you or people you know, that way there is no link between you and the vendor ever.

				All of you are worrying about something that is a NON ISSUE...Vendors have no reason to keep your info. We do not need it..it does not help us in any way and yes as the Mod said it is against the rules. And yes we follow them The rules for vendors are to be taken VERY SERIOUSLY. We make 10&#039;s of thousands of dollars a month. And we can not do that without SR. We also work very hard on our feedback and&nbsp; our reputation. You do not get them by breaking the rules. Also DPR is serious about them. If a vendor even mentions to you that he has your address and will do something with it they will lose their account. And he has done this to a top vendor..more then one..someone who was making over 50k a month.. So don&#039;t think that &quot;yea its a rule but I bet vendors keep it&quot; No we do not. What we do have is receipts with either Zip codes or with the complete address if it is a USPS Express label. And we even get rid of those and just keep the numbers. And for the most part every package should be there within 5 days..so after that vendors shred that stuff. There is just no reason to keep it.<br /><br />I read the post and I saw how all of you felt the same as the OP..And you all being new I understand how you would think that. Once you are on here for a while you will soon see how we all work and how there is just no reason to have that info. Also it is IMPORTANT that you deal with established vendors with great feedback as then you will be dealing with pros who know that they are doing. And you will have nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Good Luck!
