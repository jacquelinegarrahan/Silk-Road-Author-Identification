				Hello. I;m a noob here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve registered and been browsing and reading the forums before placing my first order.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t wanna get burned and want to be as safe as possible for everyone. <br />First --&nbsp; I wanted to post something in the security section, however I can&#039;t.&nbsp; The only place that has a button for a new topic is here in the newbie section.&nbsp; Is this normal? I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction for a good safe reliable wallet.<br /><br />Second -- It seems most vendors ask new people to FE.&nbsp; What are the dangers and risks to finalizing early?&nbsp; Any suggestions here would be REALLy appreciated.<br /><br />Third --&nbsp; Getting BitCoins. Ive read some of the posts but still am a little confused. Mt. Gox?&nbsp; Blockchain?<br /><br />Lastly -- How to use the PGP?&nbsp; Im not sure how to use the public/private keys.&nbsp; Ive installed TOR already.&nbsp; Have TORmail, and am pretty good with computers.&nbsp; I also connect on a hacked neighbors WIFI, so I don&#039;t even use my own.&nbsp; I want to be as safe as humanly possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think thats all.&nbsp; Nothing else comes to mind.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure tonight before bed I&#039;ll think of more questions but for now if anyone could help me out, or point me in the right direction .. that would be super cool.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Thank YOU

				Blockchains wallet is safe and commonly used, there is a slew of other ewallets.. your best bet for a secure ewallet would be to DL a desktop client, such as bitcoin-qt.<br /><br />Yes, new buyers are FOR THE MOST PART required to FE. Under 5 transactions. Though, you can, with thorough research, find sellers that NEVER require FE, from any one. A good way to get your first 5 buys, is to purchase ebooks. <br /><br />For coin, the two best bets are Bitinstant to BTC addy or local bitcoins. <br /><br />As for pgp, google &#039;kleopatra&#039;. DL and install that ( for windows anyway), trial and error, some time spent diddling with it and you will learn it is fairly simple. Also there is PGP clubs for newbs.

				There is no need to be stealing your neighbors wifi while you are on tor. <br /><br />Never FE, find a reliable vendor who does not ask for FE. If you can&#039;t find someone who doesn&#039;t ask for FE, make sure it&#039;s a top rated vendor.<br /><br />I add my BTC using bitinstant.com with cash to bitcoin wallet and pay with cash using fake info at moneygram at walmart. <br /><br />PGP is pretty easy once you figure it out. When you want to encrypt information for a specific person you use their public key so only they can decrypt the information. Never give out your private key. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Hi, <br />Fellow Noob here.&nbsp; Just wanted to let you know that I placed my first orders and had perfect transactions WITHOUT finalizing early.&nbsp; <br /><br />DO NOT FE, EVER.<br /><br />There are many tales of woe in this forum of buyers who FE&#039;d and got screwed.&nbsp; If you FE, you have NO recourse if something goes wrong.&nbsp; <br />I found a vendor who had no problem with me being a noob.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t even question my order...just sent it straight away.&nbsp; The vendor is Kush, and he is really the best if that is your product though he seems to be taking a break at the moment.&nbsp; <br /><br />For Bitcoins, I recommend BlueSkyTraders...find their site on Tor, also in the forum reviews.&nbsp; I just have them send the coin straight to my SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have not learned PGP yet.&nbsp; I guess that it is necessary just irks me.&nbsp; It is essential however for safe communication.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Just avoid FE. Find another vendor to do tiny transactions with till u have a few, and u are no longer required to FE. Unless u dont care about losing money. Also for step by step instruction on PGP there are tutorials on youtube, i highly recommend them.<br />Bitcoins? I personally only get them through cash locally. Check local bitcoin, craigslist, backpages maybe..
