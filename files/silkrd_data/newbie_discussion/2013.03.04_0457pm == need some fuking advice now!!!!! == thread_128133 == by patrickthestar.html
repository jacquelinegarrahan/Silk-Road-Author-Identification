				First, take a deep breath and relax.&nbsp; Second, fuck him, don&#039;t let him bother you.&nbsp; Third, don&#039;t do anything stupid to get yourself arrested or in trouble.<br /><br />Also, if you actually want advice, maybe explaining what he is doing would lead to getting better advice.<br /><br />My .05BTC...

				Yah I feel for you. <br />I got into some shit with my neighbor some time ago about my dogs and was in the same state of mind. He was one of those pricks who is always in your business, out in his yard manicuring his lawn with tweezers, while having one finger on 911 for me if he thought I was having fun. After contemplating a violent event that would have landed me in jail I decided on another approach.&nbsp; I made trays of ice with weed killer in them and launched them into his yard with an old wrist rocket while he was at work. After a short time his yard looked like yellow spotted shit and I had many great nights drinking beer on the deck watching in satisfaction as he frantically tried everything to get rid of this strange new disease. Seriously this guy went nuts, called in every lawn service and eventually ended up replacing sod in half his yard. <br /><br />I know this doesn&#039;t seem like much but it&#039;s amazing sometimes how good something like this can feel&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />Moral - Don&#039;t fuck yourself while getting even - let the violent feelings pass and use your imagination

				You haven&#039;t really gave much clue what he is actually doing... from your post, it sounds like name calling type stuff? If it is then you need to get a grip in my opinion. Talking about wanting to shoot and stab someone for calling you names makes you sound like a loose cannon. <br /><br />If he is being violent, then by all means be violent back. If he is just being a bit of a dick to you, suck it up and deal with it. Either by outwitting him and making him look stupid, or by just ignoring him... if you really can&#039;t handle being made fun of or whatever it is, and no one in a position of authority is willing to do anything about it, then just leave University and go do something else.<br /><br />I went through school being constantly called names (and spat at, and people trying to fight with me etc) because of how I dressed and the music I liked. the teachers responses were pretty much that I shouldn&#039;t dress the way I did if I didn&#039;t want to be bullied. So I made my choice, continue to express myself however I seen fit and just take the name calling on the chin, and in any situation where it wouldn&#039;t result in me being physically attacked I would try and outwit them and make them look stupid... which usually wasn&#039;t very difficult. <br /><br />If you badly hurt someone physically for attacking you verbally, it is you who is the arsehole. You&#039;re in uni, surely you are old enough to be able to just brush it off... probably everyone else in the class just thinks he is a dick. Most people leave name calling and stuff like that back in high school, the ones who are still doing it at uni are generally frowned upon by everyone around them.<br /><br />

Don&#039;t do that, man. If you inflict physical harm on him, or worse -- kill him, you will probably be caught and he will end up being the cause of you losing years and years of your life. In which case, I guess assuming he survives, then he wins. And you will be publically known as a nutcase, which is almost worse than the prison sentence, so you will likely end up going back to jail again for lack of anyone willing to hire you. It truly isn&#039;t worth it. I agree, you haven&#039;t really given us much specifics as to what he&#039;s doing to bully you so badly, or for how long. <br /><br />I agree with another poster&#039;s sentiments, though -- most of the other kids likely don&#039;t really like the kid themselves. If you were to be witty, and come back at him with EQUAL venom while keeping calm, and most importantly, genuinely not giving a fuck, then that might prevent him from doing anything after a while. You gotta embarrass him. If you can&#039;t handle that, you literally should just ignore him probably. <br /><br />By reacting emotionally, he is getting what he wants from you. If you don&#039;t react at all, then it won&#039;t &quot;get him high&quot; anymore or whatever, so to speak. But FUCK bullies, man. Nobody bullies people in college like that, or so I would think. <br /><br />Good luck buddy...

You can&#039;t sue him, well you could, but it would probably net you nothing but debt because pieces of shit generally don&#039;t have much money. <br /><br />I am from the states so it&#039;s hard for me to imagine NOTHING has been done, and I almost don&#039;t even believe you. Not calling you a liar, but you seem unstable. Calm down

				That&#039;s life&#039;s definition. I&#039;m sure most of us, if not all had to go through something similar during some point in life. It always happens, nothing really you can do to change that. I know this advice might seem kind of insulting to you but this will probably make you stronger. Think of this experience as a degree from life, it&#039;s hard as hell but once it stops well you&#039;ll see things differently -- hopefully for the better. Of course don&#039;t be a pushover, if it&#039;s that bad just go up to him and just kick him in his head when he least expects it, and just whale on him until he learns the textbook definition of &#039;pain&#039;. Maybe he&#039;ll back off for good. But killing a man? Nah. I know you said you weren&#039;t serious, and I&#039;m sure a lot of us have these thoughts of killing someone at some point, but just try to keep cool and calm, and ignore everything. <br /><br />Or you could also try planting drugs on him and calling the police. Buy few ounces of cocaine, meth or whatever, call the police and say he&#039;s giving this stuff out to children or selling it to them. It might work. If you&#039;re able to locate his room (if he&#039;s living on campus) plant some drugs there too, and weed plants as well as some meth cooking equipment. Hey, if you can get your hands on a gun plant it in his room too. Not only will he be going on trial his reputation will forever and always be ruined. <br /><br />~ Cooler.

If he&#039;s doing shit like tanning your windows and throwing rocks at you then it&#039;s probably time to do something about it. I know the police are fucking useless most of them time, I&#039;ve never had help from them when I need it... but yeah I&#039;ve been on the receiving end of a noise complaint or two, and the police are right there when that happens, they are also good at stealing my drugs from me but that hasn&#039;t happened in years lol.<br /><br />As much as I am essentially a peace loving hippy type, if someone is attacking you then you need to defend yourself. Get yourself a weapon of some kind, if you can get a hold of tear gas that is very effective (illegal in the UK, but there are ways to get it, I have a can of it for self defense).

				cooler had some good advice, basically get even, but make 100% sure it can&#039;t get back to you.<br /><br />it&#039;s quite easy to take someone out into the wood and administer a beating without getting caught

If it is then you need to get a grip in my opinion. Talking about wanting to shoot and stab someone for calling you names makes you sound like a loose cannon. <br /><br />If he is being violent, then by all means be violent back. If he is just being a bit of a dick to you, suck it up and deal with it. Either by outwitting him and making him look stupid, or by just ignoring him... if you really can&#039;t handle being made fun of or whatever it is, and no one in a position of authority is willing to do anything about it, then just leave University and go do something else.<br /><br />I went through school being constantly called names (and spat at, and people trying to fight with me etc) because of how I dressed and the music I liked. the teachers responses were pretty much that I shouldn&#039;t dress the way I did if I didn&#039;t want to be bullied. So I made my choice, continue to express myself however I seen fit and just take the name calling on the chin, and in any situation where it wouldn&#039;t result in me being physically attacked I would try and outwit them and make them look stupid... which usually wasn&#039;t very difficult. <br /><br />If you badly hurt someone physically for attacking you verbally, it is you who is the arsehole. You&#039;re in uni, surely you are old enough to be able to just brush it off... probably everyone else in the class just thinks he is a dick. Most people leave name calling and stuff like that back in high school, the ones who are still doing it at uni are generally frowned upon by everyone around them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />ta for the reply m8. I really wish it was only name calling. its much more than that. how about throwing rocks at my head nd one day and smashing my room window ? and yh i went to the police they didnt do shit the fucking law in uk is fucking useless they only deal with shit like noise complaints thats it. they told me to stop being childish and telling on people. i know right the fuck??!?! they told me accidents happen (window was smashed with a snowball that had a rock inside of it on purpose obvs) so i got relocated to a shitter appertment by uni.&nbsp; i feel like suing this motherfucker the entire uni and the police force. fuck them all. there were a lot more hes done like spreading shit about me through facebook and so on wont get into much detail. and always i try to keep my cool but i cant anymore. too bad u cant just sue ppl in uk it has to be something extremely terrible for lawyers to even waste their time with lawsuits<br /><br />hons shit like this makes ppl into serial killers im just glad i can keep my cool 9although im shaking thats how fucking enraged i am) :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah that&#039;s different. If he&#039;s doing shit like tanning your windows and throwing rocks at you then it&#039;s probably time to do something about it. I know the police are fucking useless most of them time, I&#039;ve never had help from them when I need it... but yeah I&#039;ve been on the receiving end of a noise complaint or two, and the police are right there when that happens, they are also good at stealing my drugs from me but that hasn&#039;t happened in years lol.<br /><br />As much as I am essentially a peace loving hippy type, if someone is attacking you then you need to defend yourself. Get yourself a weapon of some kind, if you can get a hold of tear gas that is very effective (illegal in the UK, but there are ways to get it, I have a can of it for self defense). Give him a blast in the face with that and then kick the shit out of him. Depending on what sort of person he is that could either end the problem or it could make it worse. You need to take into consideration what his response is likely to be, is he gonna get a shock and back down or is he gonna get a bunch of his mates and kick your door in? Do you have enough support around you that you can afford for it to escalate even further... if not then maybe going back to the police is a better idea, nothing wrong with being a grass when someone is attacking you unprovoked.

It just doesn&#039;t make sense, with all of the useless police there, you&#039;d think it be like Mexico. Run by criminal gangs and cartels, a haven for criminals. Where drugs flow free and guns are easy to come by. It really baffles my mind that a country with such little law enforcement is one of the safest countries on the planet with low numbers of gun crime and low crime rates (although I heard it is legal to own weapons in Ireland, if I&#039;m not mistaken?). I might be wrong but from the things I have seen (such as the riots in Britain) and heard from friends it really is that way. You&#039;d think someone by now would of started a cartel or an organized crime group with such little law enforcement. <br /><br />~ Cooler.

				No one can MAKE you feel a certain way. YOU are in control of your emotions, and only you. No one &quot;makes&quot; you mad or angry. Yes, other people can be fucking pricks and bitches, but by pretending THEY are the ones causing you to &quot;make&quot; you angry only gives all the power (of your emotions) to THEM. <br /><br />Own your fucking emotions, man. Fuck them, fuck whatever they do, let that shit slide off your back. If he&#039;s talking shit, let him talk shit. Ignore him and he will go away. If he&#039;s trying to get others against you, fuck it. You&#039;ll find out who your real friends are. And if it&#039;s just shit he&#039;s talking, eventually people will see that YOU were the better person for not giving a fuck, and that he&#039;s actually the asshole.<br /><br />Just read down the page and saw that he&#039;s actually being violent. If ignoring him isn&#039;t going to make the problem go away (and if and only IF he is actually being violent- otherwise ONLY the above applies), and if you can pull it off, you gather yourself, catch him somewhere when it&#039;s dark and he&#039;s alone, corner him, have the craziest look in your eyes you can get, if you&#039;re strong enough pin him against the wall, and tell him if he fucks with you again you&#039;re going to &lt;insert something here&gt;. Generally, make yourself seem crazy and fucked up enough to actually do whatever you threaten. If you need to take it a step further, have a knife on you and pin it to his throat. Or use pepper spray on him. Don&#039;t actually harm him, but make it known you will protect yourself if you need to.<br /><br />I generally never condone violence... unless life is actually being threatened, and it sounds like it&#039;s getting to that point with you. Avoid actual violence as much as possible, but at the same time, if he&#039;s throwing rocks at you and shit, it&#039;s time to step up your self-protection. I always believe in just ignoring fucking assholes, but if it came to my own life being threatened, I will set a fucker straight about that. If you have friends willing to back you up, bring them along as well. Good luck.

				If you PM me his name and Uni, I may non-violently take some revenge by planting something on him on the way into a club or something. remember though, this guy is probably a dick cus his dad beats him or his mum doesn&#039;t give a shit about him. His life is probably worse than yours. If it is, just take it mate, and be happy knowing you&#039;re an alright guy and his life sucks. I won&#039;t do anything to anyone who&#039;s being bullied by their own parents.guardians..<br /><br />My little cousin was getting bullied by one nob head and his &#039;gang&#039; cus he&#039;s gay. I checked him out, happy homelife, no problems in his past, just an ignorant homophobic so I simply spiked his drinks slowly working up to 200mg of Methadone every day for a few months then stopped suddenly. Anyone been through methadone withdrawal, especially if you don&#039;t know why it&#039;s happening. will know that&#039;s far worse than having a rock thrown at your head. He started drinking LOTS more as he thought the good feeling was from the JD, Jaegger and Monster drink he thought he&#039;d &#039;invented&#039;. This got out of hand too but the withdrawal was worse. Best thing was, he went to the doctor and obv blood tests showed the methadone, his friends and family wouldn&#039;t believe it wasn&#039;t him lying cus he&#039;d ran out of money (lucky coincidence). Anytime he tried to take the piss out of my cousin he&#039;d just laugh at him for being a junkie liar who still couldn&#039;t even admit it.<br /><br />This though mate, was a really really horrible thing to do and I regret it often, I&#039;m actually a really nice person and I&#039;ve matured a lot since then, but I hate ignorant &#039;isms&#039; and nobody fucks with my family, if I could go back though, I wouldn&#039;t have done it again.<br /><br />Think on before doing anything stupid

				Well first things first. You place out the morals you&#039;ve been embedded with and see what&#039;s logical, if the little fucker crosses the line you should probably introduce him your friend &quot;Passive-Aggressive&quot;.<br />Lure him into being a good friend of him and let him step all over you, it helps in the end. Then attack when most vulnerable, but if it&#039;s deem too much for you commit crimes to him that are untraceable and do well to frame another person you hate/despise. Here&#039;s what I think you should do. Drug him with chloroform and pull out his all of his teeth, then you shove your fucking thick cock down his throat and hose his face down with your fucking seed. Letting your possible children die and impregnate right on his pathetic face. After that you dress him up really pretty in all pink, mini-skirt, bra, tight thong or g-string (use your mom or sister&#039;s drawer), some nice stocking from JcPenny&#039;s. Then you place assorted alcohol beverages in the background making it seem like he/she god so fucking piss faced drunk. If you into piercing do some on his nips, mouth, ears, cock, balls, whatever gives you a hardon. After you done that you just write how much of a slutty cum dumpster that piece of worthless shit on his face and whole body. Hell even tattoo it on him, then FUCKING TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Eh just a suggestion, by the way send me a copy. &lt;3<br /><br />Edit: Tell me your reactions I&#039;d love a giggle.

				My advice would be to wait till he hasn&#039;t said or done anything to you for a day or two and then strike; get a balaclava and then just simply follow him around with it on, do this several times over the next few days/nights and eventually he&#039;ll start freaking out. Then send him a letter written in blood or something, detailing what you&#039;re going to do if you see him bullying anybody anymore, pretend as if you are watching him bully you/others and that you don&#039;t sympathize with them to rule you out as a suspect, but tell him in great detail what you&#039;re planning on doing if he keeps it up.

You place out the morals you&#039;ve been embedded with and see what&#039;s logical, if the little fucker crosses the line you should probably introduce him your friend &quot;Passive-Aggressive&quot;.<br />Lure him into being a good friend of him and let him step all over you, it helps in the end. Then attack when most vulnerable, but if it&#039;s deem too much for you commit crimes to him that are untraceable and do well to frame another person you hate/despise. Here&#039;s what I think you should do. Drug him with chloroform and pull out his all of his teeth, then you shove your fucking thick cock down his throat and hose his face down with your fucking seed. Letting your possible children die and impregnate right on his pathetic face. After that you dress him up really pretty in all pink, mini-skirt, bra, tight thong or g-string (use your mom or sister&#039;s drawer), some nice stocking from JcPenny&#039;s. Then you place assorted alcohol beverages in the background making it seem like he/she god so fucking piss faced drunk. If you into piercing do some on his nips, mouth, ears, cock, balls, whatever gives you a hardon. After you done that you just write how much of a slutty cum dumpster that piece of worthless shit on his face and whole body. Hell even tattoo it on him, then FUCKING TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Eh just a suggestion, by the way send me a copy. &lt;3<br /><br />Edit: Tell me your reactions I&#039;d love a giggle.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re crazy. Insane actually.. who in their right minds would advise someone to use chloroform? It won&#039;t last long before he wakes up. Use rohypnol. Or smash a brick on his head, that will knock him out.. maybe more.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />lol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well alright the chloroform was too much, he should bask the guy in bathtub of pure thick horse semen and water board him with that as you have a gigantic orgy of leather covered bear-men. Whilst bashing 6feet long dildos on his head and forcing him to ejaculated from the trauma.<br /><br />Better? &gt;:)
