				Dude the only way to steralize that fucker is to throw it away. If you shoot that up after steralizing it ANY way your gonna get Hep B. FUCK THAT! Count it as a loss.

				Put it in some rice to draw out all of the water.&nbsp; Leave it overnight.<br /><br />First, I should point out, there are more germs on the door handle to your house than in your toilet.<br /><br />Secondly....<br /><br />Sterilization would be a bit difficult.&nbsp; To sterilize something, you need to get it at 225 degrees for about 30 minutes.&nbsp; This kills ALL bacteria.<br /><br />If I were you, I&#039;d put it in a ziploc bag, and throw it in a pot of boiling water for 20 minutes.&nbsp; Water boils at 212 degrees (faranheit), so unless you put it in a pressure cooker or an oven, you won&#039;t be able to get it past 212.&nbsp; I would think boiling will kill most harmful bacteria that you&#039;re worried about.<br /><br />Good luck.

Just letting the pill touch your fingers was probably more dirty than the toilet water. That being said, i&#039;d just eat in or snort it. But then again i&#039;ve been there with iv&#039;ing pills. I saw it as a total waste to eat or snort. It wasn&#039;t until i learned how much of the oxycodone i was wasting by iv&#039;ing that made me make the switch to mostly eating them. Let that one go. Don&#039;t iv it. It&#039;s not worth the risk of bacterial infection in your bloodstream. I&#039;m so lucky to be alive with all the unsanitary practices i had when i was shooting dope.

This would be so pointless. If you dissolve it and then let all the alcohol evaporate you will still be left with the same product... Just crush the shit and parachute it.

When people dissolve a chemical into a solvent such as alcohol it creates a liquid solution of it. They mainly do this to put the chemical on blotter paper because the blotter will absorb the chemical solution. Once the chemical is on the blotter paper they evaporate the alcohol off leaving just the powdered chemical in the blotter paper. Dissolving the chemical in a solvent such as alcohol will do nothing. You&#039;re basically turning into a liquid to turn it back into powder. It does not sterilize it. Just count it as a loss if you are that worried. I really hope you understand. Good Luck.

If you get HEP A from the toilet water, at least you&#039;ll have a little pain relief to help ease you....
