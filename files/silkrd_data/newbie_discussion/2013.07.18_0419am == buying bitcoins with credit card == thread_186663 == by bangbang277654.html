				Little idea I had the other month - Ebay... As long as you&#039;ve got a verified paypal account and a good ebay rep you could message the bitcoin sellers and you&#039;ll hopefully be able to find someone willing to do an immediate transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In all honesty I&#039;ve never done it because I don&#039;t have paypal, and I haven&#039;t bought btc for ages, but it should work... theoretically, :) AB.

				the problem with ebay is trust on both ends. Buyer could claim didn&#039;t receive and ask for refund. And even with gift cards/no returns option seller might not even send, and you won&#039;t be able to do anything not even damage the feedback of the seller.

				A business accepting credit cards as payment is very risky. While bitcoin transactions are final, credit card transactions can be disputed and reversed. This means a scamming buyer could pay with a CC, get BTC, and report to his card issuer that it was a fraudulent purchase. The card issuer would then take the money back from the business. This leaves the business out BTC and payment.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Doesn&#039;t VirWox do cc purchases? I&#039;d check it out before you take this for truth, but I remember seeing a PayPal and a Visa option. Only issue is that the fees are ridiculous! Around 12% if I remember correctly...plus that weird work-around with that Second Life currency.
