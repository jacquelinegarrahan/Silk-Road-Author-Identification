				so first of all HI ;)<br /><br />i&#039;m really looking forward to make my first order, i&#039;v read tons of message and info to undestand how this all work but i still got some interrogation.<br /><br />what i read everywhere is that you don&#039;t have to sign when you receive your package, i&#039;m french and in my country, like at no point i could have my package without signing for it and if you are not home, they just pass by after to make sure you get it and sign for it. So i don&#039;t really undestand that part, can i say to the delivery man, i didnt ordered anything but i&#039;ll take it but i won&#039;t sign for it ?<br /><br />and that actually my main question, or also what site is the best to get my bc, but i can find out myself i guess.<br /><br />I was also hesitating on what to buy first, what was you guys first orded ?

				well you cant help if someone sent you a gift, anyway you want to see what you got, maybe your cousin from australia shipped you a gift like he does every now and than =)<br /><br />for where to get bitcoins use, localbitcoins.com probably best to keep you under the radar or if you know someone personaly or maybe find out if there are any bitcoins meetings where you can just give cash to guy and he transfers money to you otehrwise you aswell have mtgox and btc-e but that will leave track

				Depends on where you&#039;re from I suppose but I think they typically leave you a non-delivery notice that tells you either when they will try again or at what local post office you can pick it up from.

				i would imagine since it&#039;s manditory where your at you would have more plausible denialbility that you knew something of an illegal nature was coming . either way signing mostly means you recived said package but if you sign for many it looks normal .i guess the diffrence would be in your countries paticular laws and wheather it was an international or domestic order. i would sign it unless the mailguy is sweating ect.

				I would just sign for the thing..it sounds like thats standard where you are? Making some big deal about not signing is a bit odd..and I would think draws more attention then just doing as normal..

				Hi,...<br />am a member also a buyer from SR,...<br /><br />1st regarding to your Question :<br />1. About sign POST Office - The safety way is find a Fake address, then have someone stay there for maybe a month or 2 month in case if&nbsp; the package lil bit late.<br />&nbsp;then after that just emptied the house, then find someone else if you wanna Order again.<br /><br />2. About BTC - you can read all the forum, but as my personal experience am using AurumXchange : https://www.aurumxchange.com/ but it&#039;s on a clear net, but you can use TOR as well to access it.<br /><br />(it&#039;s based on my own experience as a drug dealer at my country)<br /><br />Regards, XS<br />

				Well, it depends the package size I guess - if it fits in an envelope, then you probably won&#039;t have to sign for it...<br /><br />Small order might be the key :)<br /><br />Regarding BTC, there are many options, finding someone in your area and giving him/her cash will of course be the more anonymous option...
