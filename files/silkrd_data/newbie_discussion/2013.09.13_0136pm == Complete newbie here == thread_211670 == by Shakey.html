				Hello,<br /><br />I am a complete newbie here. A friend of mine suggested Silkroad and I registered two weeks ago. So far just browsing through the site, reading the forums and I am baffled at everything. It seems there are a lot of chances to get scammed. My intensions are honest here. The reason I am here is that I want to purchase some magic mushrooms and/or LSD. I have a medical condition (cluster headaches) for which shrooms and LSD offer significant relief.<br /><br />Anyway, I plan to purchase BC via localbitcoins. What do I do after that? How do I transfer bitcoins to SR account? How does the escrow service work?<br /><br />It seems a lot of sellers require FE (finalize early) for newbies, especially after recent events (what were those?) and as far as I&#039;ve read FE is a big no-no :-)<br /><br />Does anyone know a reliable source for LSD/shrooms that ships to Europe? <br /><br />Please, point in me in the right direction. I&#039;ve read through the wiki page, although not thoroughly.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Welcome to the road!<br /><br />Ok so when you get you BTC you transfer them into you SR account so they can be used to purchase of the site. To get the BTC address of your SR account you just log on and select my account. If its your first time there should be a link saying something along the lines of &#039;click here to make a deposit&#039; Once you have your BTC from localbitcoins you just send them to that SR address. You can also look into using a coin tumbler service such as bitcoinfog which will increase anonymity by mixing your coins with other peoples before giving you back the same amount (minus a fee).<br /><br />for information on LSD vendors you want to check the avengers LSD thread which will pretty much tell you everything you need to know about the vendors on here.

				Welcome,<br /><br />My top tips (as a 3 day old Newb) would be:<br /><br />1. Learn the rating systems and read the forums before buying form a Vendor. Always err on the side of caution.<br />2. Assume everyone is full of shit and weed out reality from there.<br /><br />@Luvs2trip - Stole my thunder!<br /><br />Happy Hunting<br /><br /><br />

				Welcome! Enjoy your stay, be safe.<br /><br />The bitcoin buying market is always a pain to navigate. He&#039;s not taking new customers right now, but in the future JumboMonkeyBiscuit runs a great cash-in-mail service. Don&#039;t bother using a tumbler- it&#039;s not illegal to have bitcoin in a wallet managed by Silk Road, and the Road will tumble your btc. You can change your wallet address on the Road whenever you&#039;d like, and this will anonymize them somewhat as well.<br /><br />You should try to avoid finalizing early, but for the first few transactions you may not be able to help it. Just make sure you pick reputable vendors with lots of transactions- their reputation is a lot more important to them than screwing you out of a few bitcoin. Start small and build up- maybe even order a legal thing or two.<br /><br />When you do go for shrooms and acid, MrPsych is currently on vacation but has a huge variety of shrooms and ships from the UK. I haven&#039;t used his shrooms, but his 2C-T-2 was quite good. Jannis sells the best acid I&#039;ve (or anyone I know) has ever had. Beautiful dolphin blotter, and can ship within the EU.<br /><br />Happy tripping :)

				Allright,<br /><br />thanks everyone for your replies. I found a person living close to me from localbitcoins site and I&#039;ll be making a purchase of my first bitcoin soon hopefully. In the meantime I&#039;ll check the forums and rules to get familiar with things.<br /><br />Cheers.

				Honestly there&#039;s not as much scamming as you may think.<br />As long as you go with a credible 5/5 vendor (although 4.8+ is usually ok), check the reviews and NEVER, EVER FE, then you will be fine. If you are scammed (and you haven&#039;t finalized), then you are usually refunded.<br />~D

				HI Shakey,<br />although i am no expert-i have been reading the forums for awhile and there is a ton of good info here- and here are some basics- it is recommended that you<br /><br />1)use pgp when sharing personal info(sending your name/address to vendor when ordering) you can use the newbie pgp thread to learn- its not hard<br /><br />2) research vendors before purchase- search main forums and especially the rumor mill<br /><br />3)never FE ( finalize early) the escrow system is designed to protect you from scam- so use it - if vendor demands - find another-<br /><br />safe travels

				be sure to read all about the vendor you choose prior to ordering. sometimes they could go in stealth mode or have policies change. always read a vendors page twice over and if they have a thread in the forums give that a good look through as well. you can never be too sure and its always better to be safe than sorry.
