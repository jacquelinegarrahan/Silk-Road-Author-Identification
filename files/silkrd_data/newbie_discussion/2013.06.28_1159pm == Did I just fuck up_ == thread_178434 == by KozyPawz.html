				Hey guys, found out about the deep web not so long ago, and the contents of it shortly after. I&#039;ve been through the wiki and seen the different sites and stuff, but my first stop was SR, then The Peoples Drug Store, and then NL Growers. After I got paid I got some bitcoins and was ready to go. Ordered 10g with two different strains from NLGrowers and two grams of coke from TPDS, and deposited the leftovers to SR. Now I&#039;m starting to freak out a little bit because both the NLG and TPDS sites have a system that you can&#039;t message them until you&#039;ve placed an order, in which I did, but still can&#039;t message them 24 hours later. I know I should&#039;ve just done it all on SR, but when the products are endless on many sites, it&#039;s easy to get lost in everything. <br /><br />The main problem is that I forgot to add a name to the NLG order, and I can&#039;t message them or get in contact with them in any way to fix it. Does anyone have an experience with any of those sites and vendors? Mainly the NLG ofcourse. Ain&#039;t easy being the new one, start to freak out over everything.

				I think you&#039;re right... still, if nothing turns up at least it wasnt as bad as it could have been... didnt order much.<br /><br />
