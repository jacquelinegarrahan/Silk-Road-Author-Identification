				Ever since I was on some informational site DMT really was the one that caught my eye. It&#039;s the most POWERFUL(est) psychedelic known to man and tell me if I&#039;m wrong, has no bad long term side effect.<br /><br />Is this really true guys? Or it&#039;s only the unexpected intense shock is what scars you?<br /><br />Stories I wanna hear it all!<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Yeah I know how some of you are offended and I&#039;d like to apologize in advanced if you&#039;re hurt. I will be creating a lottery soon as another way to say sorry to you guys, Enter my BTC raffle here on Silkroad Forums: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=127676.0

				nn dimethyltryptamine.... I think..... Portney, you didn&#039;t offend me but it just didn&#039;t seem like you know what you would be playing with. Most people just slash around the puddles and don&#039;t dive in anyway... Like 15mg dose. When you vape 60 mgs in one hit with a vaporizer you will know.

				i doesn&#039;t have any long term side effects, at least non from a physiological point of view.&nbsp; <br />the trip itself can be overly intense however, so some prior experience with psychedelics to ease into the territory might not be the worst idea <br />like magic mushrooms, which contain 4-HO-DMT as their active compound (though you still can&#039;t really compare the two experience-wise)<br />among other things, what might scare you with nn-dmt is both the rapid onset as well as the sheer &quot;speed&quot; of the experience (think of a 9 hour lsd trip compressed into 10 minutes)<br />

				So I&#039;m gonna start off by saying that DMT is truely god&#039;s gift to man. It induces such a spiritual awakening. The prices listed on SR for DMT are so rediculously high I would never buy it off SR. If you can&#039;t find it at all in the area you are from, then I would recommend you spend the money for your first experience, because it will always be worth it...

				I don&#039;t know if you can overdose on it, I think that you can&#039;t, but it scared me. The trip is intense, but the scary part is when it&#039;s first kicking in (this is just for me, I don&#039;t know if everybody experiences it) my heart beat goes up REALLY high (or it feels like it) and I&#039;m scared that I&#039;m having a heart attack. I&#039;m in my mid fifties, so that experience may not happen to other people. <br />Several times I&#039;ve woken up afterwards and not had any memories of the trip itself, I wonder if my consciousness didn&#039;t want to accept the visions (or something) or wondered whether I really did black out. <br />Also, after you do it, there&#039;s a period of time that you CAN&#039;T get high, it lasts at least an hour (other people will chime in with better estimates) It&#039;s not illegal to buy the herb, but of course very illegal to extract the DMT. If I remember correctly, you soak the herb in a acid or basic solution (it&#039;s been a long time) and extract it with naptha (hexane is better cause it doesn&#039;t smell as much-naphtha has a very chemical smell and you have to use a couple of quarts, so that&#039;s a lot of smell around-anybody near would notice it)<br />You dry the naphtha, and get the white or off white color powder. You get quite a bit. <br />Sorry I don&#039;t remember the extraction better it&#039;s been at least 5 years. <br />Before I got high (small hits that really didn&#039;t &#039;rock my world&#039;), the colors around me got really intense and I thought I saw a little dwarf like being with a cartoonish grin sitting up on my bookshelf. <br />Something else, when I got some good hits (and not passed out) I would immediately (5-10 seconds max) see everything in geometric shapes (you&#039;ll know what I mean if you experience it) and I&#039;ll think &#039;here I go again!!&#039;. <br />It&#039;s pretty easy and cheap to extract, but the heartbeat thing (for me) takes away most of my desire to use it, might try it again someday. I don&#039;t care too much about the sudden rush, to me it&#039;s like jumping into a cold lake (or something) it&#039;s quite a shock.

				I&#039;ve tried it, probably one of the most intense, spiritual, introspective and best nights / mornings of my life. I done it how it should be done, although I understand it&#039;s not for everyone. I was travelling alone in the Amazon jungle and I got to a port town called Iquitos in the Amazon basin in Peru. It is famous for it&#039;s many Shamans who regularly have rituals around the taking of DMT. I met the Shaman and went into the jungle where I took it in a hut with about 20 other people. We all had a mattress to lay down on. The Shaman mixes the dose and depending on your size and body weight etc. I drank it, takes about 45 mins to kick in. I can&#039;t tell how long it lasted because time really does become non existent, but it must have been about 8 hours. I lay down and closed my eyes and it took me on an amazing journey through the universe and the spirit of Ayahuasca (DMT) answered some important questions for me (before the ceremony we were told to have some questions you want answered about life ready for the spirit and it will guide you, I thought it was bullshit until I experienced what was to come). It can make a lot of people vomit and shit themselves, which is a down side (didn&#039;t happen me) but soon after you will feel good again. Best not to eat anything for at least a day if you&#039;re doing it the way I did. Maybe just some rice. <br />I left the place with my mind really opened up to the possibilities of what is going on in the universe and the tiny part we play in it. I&#039;m not overly spiritual or anything, but an experience like that will leave you questioning some things.<br /><br />It was one of the best things I ever done. Approach it in the right mind frame, embrace the trip and the spirits, have an open mind and I think you will have one of the best experiences of your life.

				im so interested to try this stuff, but what is the best way to take it, i&#039;ve heard people say they recommend taking it oral as you dont get the same depth as if you smoked it. <br /><br />What do you think and what is a recommended dose first time, oral?
