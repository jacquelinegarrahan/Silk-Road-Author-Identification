				A full day? That can&#039;t be right. Check the details of the transaction it will tell you if it has been confirmed.

The tumbler sends the bitcoin through many addresses to hide the origin and destination of the transaction. Also make sure to check the destination address and not the originating address. If the bitcoin does not show up in more than 12 hours, contact support. Hope that helps.

Did you check blockchain for the two addresses, the one you sent from and the one you sent to? Do you see the bitcoin sent out of the first address? Is it the right amount? Does it go to your SR address? You may not recognize an address in the blockchain because of the tumbler, but you should be able to tell where the bitcoin is in general with blockchain.

				Yes, transfers are delayed.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t see your coins within 12 hours, send SR Support a message from the main site.

There will not be any info for one of them but there will be for the other.

It&#039;s scary when your money is up in the air and you have no idea what&#039;s going on or who to contact. I&#039;ve had issues with Bitinstant where my payments were held when they were similar because of a security feature they have to protect against duplicate payments. I had to contact Bitinstant to get it resolved. SR always comes through.

				I advise breaking up amounts of money you want to transfer/send. Is more of a hassle but reduces risk of losing it all from a bad transaction.
