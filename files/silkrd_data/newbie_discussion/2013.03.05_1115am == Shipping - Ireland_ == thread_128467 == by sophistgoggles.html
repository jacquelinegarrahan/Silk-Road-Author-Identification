				Probably not the best place to put this if I&#039;m looking for advice from experienced Silk Roaders (Roadies?), but what can you do.<br /><br />Newbie in Ireland, looking to make my first SR purchase in a few weeks - a piddling personal amount shipped from Germany (from a seller with reputable stealth), but a quick search for the word &#039;Ireland&#039; in the Shipping forum has me wanting a bit of reassurance/advice.<br /><br />Buyers/sellers, what&#039;s been your experience in shipping to Ireland? Rates of success/seizure? I doubt anyone&#039;s going to be arsed setting up a CD for 2gr of weed, but is there anything I should be alert to? Is it safe enough to ship to your home,* or does anyone have any recommendations for mail drops/PO boxes? Or is it better to try and find a middle-man?<br /><br />(*I live with others, so a fake name would only arouse suspicion, and probably get my shipment opened if I wasn&#039;t able to intercept it.)<br /><br />So many questions! I know some of these will turn up dozens of answers in a search (and I&#039;ve been looking!), but I&#039;d like to hear about people&#039;s specific experiences with Ireland/Irish customs/the idiosyncrasies of An Post.

				There&#039;s a thread somewhere with some good details and even inside stuff. My own experience: stealthy weed and hash make it, pills hardly ever. (To protect the pharm industry since there&#039;s not much else left.) Packages from Holland are closely watched. And Summer is the absolute worst time to ship, apparently staffing levels go up at airport customs.

				Also living with other people is the perfect cover to have something shipped in your own name. Who&#039;s to say which one of those fuckers set you up?

				Hah, touch√©. Cheers, mate, and thanks for the reassurance. Just put in a small order for a less controlled substance, so we&#039;ll see how that goes!
