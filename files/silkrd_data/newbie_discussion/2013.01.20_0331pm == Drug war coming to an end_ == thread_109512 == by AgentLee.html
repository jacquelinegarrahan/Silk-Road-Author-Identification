				If anyone missed it, Jarecki&#039;s &#039;The House I Live In&#039; has been released. It&#039;s so-so as far as documentaries go - ponderous but a reasonable polemic. <br /><br />It argues that the drug war is a class war, based on US incarceration stats.<br /><br />

				I really hope it does but I am hesitant to say it will end anytime soon. <br /><br />The majority of the arguments being used by Cannabis advocates can be applied to multiple other substances.

				The US war on drugs will not go away for a very long time...&nbsp; It&#039;s too simple of a message... if we stop this the world will be perfect... never mind logic (Considering weed is less deadly and damaging then nicotine, booze and even gambling... all LEGAL in US).<br /><br />Though a trend is starting to emerge where weed may be removed from the war, though I suspect it will be another 10 years before it is official via Feds and majority of states.&nbsp; It has started though with Wash and Col.<br /><br />

				One thing that is often absent from discussions like these (and IMO plays a HUGE part in various governments&#039; decision NOT to legalize) is HOW do we legalize in a way that keeps the money out of the hands of the cartels and bad guys that kill and maim and destroy? <br /><br />That&#039;s been an issue in California with cannabis - cartel influence hasn&#039;t been kept separate from the loosely enforced medical marijuana industry. This is partly why we&#039;ve seen federal raids in California whereas we haven&#039;t (to my knowledge) seen any in Colorado or Washington, which have gone to great lengths to ensure that the new marijuana industry is quarantined from any cartel influence. <br /><br />We want to legalize and help society, not simply rebrand black markets with all their negative externalities as &quot;legal.&quot;

Governance is about control. All that has happened in Portugal is the control has shifted, from people who use drugs being controlled through the criminal justice system to people being controlled through the health system. So now, in Portugal is you are caught with drugs repeatedly you are forced to go into &#039;treatment&#039;. Drug use is still considered &#039;abnormal&#039;; something to be fixed.<br /><br />Yes, we need regulated markets, not just black market &#039;legalisation&#039;. But then i also think its problematic that now all these neo-liberal economists are speaking out in favour of the legalisation of drugs, saying that there is money to be made, and hey were in a GFC and we need money.<br /><br />Drugs, as with everything in society, will always be &#039;controlled&#039;. All we can do is find ways to make the effects of that control less and less. It is naieve to think that there awaits some magic pot of gold at the end of the decriminalisation rainbow (such as portugal). But indeed, it is a start.

				The US won&#039;t ever relax their laws and neither will any country that follows them.<br /><br />The USA started the war on drugs because its profitable for them -- or it used to be.<br /><br />So many people now understand that with responsible use some of these drugs can not only be fun but therapeutic for you -- can;t prosecute everyone.

Take a good look and anything that they couldn&#039;t easily tax the shit out of people for are all illegal. For example there was a scientist who created a car that ran solely on steam that water created in the engine. What did the government do? They bought the patent for it and made it illegal because they knew they couldn&#039;t get nearly as much in taxes for water as they could with gas and oil.

It always comes down to the taxes. We&#039;re taxed on literally everything, even water the element that is essential to being alive. Take a good look and anything that they couldn&#039;t easily tax the shit out of people for are all illegal. For example there was a scientist who created a car that ran solely on steam that water created in the engine. What did the government do? They bought the patent for it and made it illegal because they knew they couldn&#039;t get nearly as much in taxes for water as they could with gas and oil.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I disagree. It&#039;s far easier to collect taxes on something that&#039;s legal and regulated than something that sells only on the black market because of its illegality. Just look at cigarettes. You don&#039;t see anyone growing hydroponic tobacco in their basements do you? Also, that story about the &quot;steam powered car&quot; is apocryphal.

				I seriously doubt any existing form of government will ever suddenly gain an enlightened policy toward recreational drugs.<br /><br />Yes, they should comprehend that responsible recreational drug use is a reality, and that prohibition is counter-intuitive, and not really the responsibility of any large-scale State to regulate, regardless of the individual&#039;s responsibility in his or her recreational use, but no existing national government is going to suddenly gain enlightenment.<br /><br />This won&#039;t ever happen in our lifetime. The government is merely a tool of control and oppression by the elite. The elite are not enlightened, therefore the government which serves them (not you) is also unenlightened.

				Drug war, what a scam that is.&nbsp; Governments selectively criminalize certain substances thereby creating more revenue for their LE and prison system. They also create their own black markets too.&nbsp; If shit were legal alot of people in the le industry would be unemployed.&nbsp; Free countries? yeah right, thats why they can tell you what to put in your own body, and if they catch you disobeying them they punish you?&nbsp; Thats not freedom, thats control.&nbsp; Thats what its all about these days.&nbsp; There is no drug war really, its a facade designed to deceive the general public that think that government is always good and never bad.&nbsp; Those are the sheep.&nbsp; Time to wake up.

				It&#039;s sadly and very disappointing to even have a &quot;War on drugs&quot;. It fixes and individualizes a single person and attempts to prevent them from experiencing it. It is BECAUSE of &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; the fucking crimes of selling cut drugs on the street happen and how these people get hooked on other drugs without knowing how fucked they are. I would LOVE to see America actually gain back it&#039;s reputation as a true free country. It is within OUR FREEDOMS that WE THE PEOPLE choose OUR OWN DESTINY.<br /><br />

				Well the past has continually shown that policy has failed to decrease the supply and distribution. Also it seems apparent that there is a global reshaping of social consensus on most recreational drugs.<br /><br />It seems to me that the repression of non-pharmaceutical drugs is on a trajectory to end, or at least decrease significantly, but who knows what events may occur that could change this trajectory.<br /><br />Really, I think the time must come soon where all the other problems we have created for ourselves as a species become so clearly paramount that our global society will have no choice but to take bake control of their own lives and redefine the principles of government; either that or undergo widespread social disintegration and numerous regional collapses.
