				How is the exchange rate of USD to BTC on the site determined? And how often does it change? It seems like about once a day but I can&#039;t quite tell. Is there any pattern of regularity?

				Yeah, I&#039;ve seen that happen before. I&#039;m just curious, because it can be tough after all the hoops one has to jump through to get BTC anonymously these days to predict exactly how many you&#039;ll need as a buyer.<br /><br />Which exchange rate, exactly, is SR&#039;s tied to? It&#039;s usually lower than Mt Gox but way higher than say, BTC-e.

				Pretty damn often these days.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t around for about a month and when I came back it looks like they&#039;ve rolled out quite a few changes.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been browsing a few items and I notice the amount in my account (USD) changes pretty often.<br /><br />Also check out this thread if you haven&#039;t read it yet:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178647.0

				I&#039;m glad I&nbsp; planned ahead and bought more bitcoins than I needed a couple of weeks ago. If the deflation continues (hell, even if the price stays the same) I don&#039;t have to buy coins for months.&nbsp; :) Though there has been a couple of crashes, it seems the btc value increases over time, so it&#039;s a good idea to by coins weeks before you actually plan to use them.

Gotta say I&#039;m jealous, cuz I always feel like I end up on the wrong side of price fluctuations. I wish I had bought in hard back in early July when BTC was tanked.
