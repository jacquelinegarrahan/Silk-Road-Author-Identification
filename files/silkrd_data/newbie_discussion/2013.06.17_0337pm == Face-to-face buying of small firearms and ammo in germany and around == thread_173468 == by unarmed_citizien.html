				I have been trying to buy guns and ammo 2 times on BMR and one time privately through mail and got scammed all the way through, losing over 3500 Euro in total, im fed up with this thing. <br />Thus im asking if there is anyone willing to make a deal with me, face-to-face. Yes Im aware of all the risk (possible arrest, etc etc), but im sure there are people willing to help me. I am willing to travel also to neighboring countries (im from germany) for this<br /><br />Greets

				If you&#039;re willing to do it face-to-face, why not just ask your drug dealer after building some sort of trust? They usually know where to get stuff like that from for protection.

				&nbsp;:o Let me give you something to think about, do you really think a arm dealer would be willing to meet face to face over the internet? Think about your safety and the logic for one second please. A arms dealer is usually a successful person due to their always being a demand for fire arms including illegal ones. So do you think they&#039;d risk the success they currently have just to make a random customer happy. Come on I know you have good intentions and all but you have to think wisely about your &#039;&#039;want&#039;s&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;need&#039;s.&#039;&#039; if you really NEED this gun for your own safety and life than yes I understand going to these extreme HAZARDOUS DANGEROUS measures. Just remember the risk&#039;s you could get robbed,assaulted,ARRESTED. <br /><br />Now that I&#039;m done with my nagging, if you do end up going down this route I suggest you do it all via phone thru drops, you drop the cash somewhere person picks it up and drops the gun. You wait around somewhere hidden and make sure everything looks legit. That&#039;s how I&#039;d do it because you can either get your money took. On the other hand you can go face to face and get your money took or arrested. So that&#039;s just my advice hope this helps plenty.<br /><br />
