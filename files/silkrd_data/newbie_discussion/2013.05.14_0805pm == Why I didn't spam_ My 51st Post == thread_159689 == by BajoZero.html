				This is great advice and I appreciate it. This is why I haven&#039;t spammed to get to fifty, because I figured it couldn&#039;t hurt anything to learn as much as possible before I started actually buying anything on SR

				A spam post here and there ain&#039;t so bad. It can be an agonizing process trying to find 50 relevant topics to comment on. In any case, I don&#039;t judge anyone who spammed to 50 or consciously reached that number by constructing thoughtful posts. The important part is if they went on to spam the other boards after that or became an important contributor to the SR community.

				Hey Bajozero!<br />Yes its good that a vendor interacts with the customers.It makes you more human to us and us more to you.you&#039;ll get a feel for what your customers want from your products and even a heads up on new items people might wish for and you think you can supply.<br />Good for you bro!<br />Hope to see more of you about the forums.<br />oh,btw,spamming is for dicks ;)<br /><br />Peace and love,Darktime 8)

				Through myself not spamming, I&#039;ve spoke to some thoughtful and intelligent folk, such as Darktime, AgentLee, Japan1980, Shifting Sands and SweetPoison, to name just a few. I&#039;m lucky and glad that nice people who don&#039;t have to, frequent the newbie threads too.&nbsp;

				I love spending time on SR looking at all the different goodies, but I have been spending even more time reading on the forums. And the forums make this market work out so great. From the reviews, to the people posting about scammers. Everything works out perfectly and I&#039;m looking forward to posting more and making more purchases on SR.

Thanks for the silent shout-out, actually found this post while looking for an older post by Christy on GMO, and wanted to share something. Glad to have SR friends like you and CN, NorCal, and the like. Vendors supporting vendors, buyers supporting buyers, we&#039;re all in it for the same damn reasons. Never FE! <br /><br />Btw; sorry for totally ripping off your vendor page lay-out Bajo... it was too Pro. Couldn&#039;t resist.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />**and yes, for the record, I am one of 4 of the users known as &quot;Festivalia&quot; here on the forums. Instead of pointing out examples of BAD vendors, I am now focusing on setting the example as a GOOD vendor. For now, we&#039;re working with a handful of vets and taking baby-steps til we perfect everything down to a modern science. We want to find what works best for us, adapting packing and policies from both BajoZero and Christy Nugs(friends!). <br /><br />Glad I was able to reiterate the importance of the forums for you; and the response I got from that thread/message was over-whelming; truly feel that most of the good vendors on here really do want to be a part of the success; not a part of the problem. Directing our buyers, friends, and other vendors to the boards and being the GOOD examples... that&#039;s the key to getting past the scammers that aim to ruin the name of this Site.<br /><br />Much respect Bajo.
