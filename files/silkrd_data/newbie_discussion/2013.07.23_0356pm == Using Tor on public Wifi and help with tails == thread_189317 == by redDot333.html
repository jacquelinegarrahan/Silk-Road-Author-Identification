				First off can someone just explain to me what tails is?&nbsp; I believe it is a way to save your information on a encrypted USB stick rather then your harddrive?&nbsp; Can someone explain this to me because I would love to do that before placing my first order so I dont have any info saved onto my harddrive.<br /><br />Secondly, is it safer to use a public wifi then a home network?&nbsp; Ive been looking threw the forums and seem to find both opinions on it.&nbsp; I was thinking about using a free VPN at a public wifi with tails to make my first order?&nbsp; Does that seem like safe enough security and what not?<br /><br />Still trying to get the hang of all this down....<br /><br />Thanks for the help

				Tails is The Amnesic Incognito Live System<br />its an operating system{like windows} that runs on a cd or usb stick{as opposed to your comp}<br />so no traces are left on your HDD. Definitely better than windows IMO.<br />VPN&#039;s and public wifi are not needed if you are just buying small amounts for personal.<br /><br />

				thats all it is, just small amounts for personal use and friends.&nbsp; So think ill be good just using tor from my home network and nothing else?&nbsp; My one thing is i just dont really want any evidence saved on my harddrive so I want to look into that more[/b]

				I highly recomend tails, it is very easy to use and it&#039;s kinda cool to know that its all <br />on tiny usb that you can hide anywhere. I used to just use TBB on my comp but i <br />didn&#039;t like the way windows was running...seemed like alot going on in the backround.<br />I now feel alot safer when browsing for my wares.

				sounds good to me, using the same thing. you could set up a virtual machine as well. <br />I try to keep it simple,everything on the flash when browsing sr, nothing stored on the HD.<br />It is one of many laptops I have so it just looks like an old one I dont use anymore. good luck!

As a whole, a community, silk road is only is strong as it&#039;s weakest link. Everyone should take security and anonymity very seriously, if not for your own sake, for the sake of everyone else here and to keep what we have going.

				I use a Padalock2 16g flash drive that I bought at Amazon for around $40. I put Tor on it and any other files I don&#039;t want on my HD. Before you use it, you have to unlock it with a numeric code of your choosing. When you unplug, it automatically locks and nobody can use it without unlocking it.&nbsp; http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Padlock-Flash-Drive-CMFPLA16GB/dp/B003SHMKHS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374780218&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=padlock+flash+drive

				I am currently using Tor with bridge relays, but I am planning to upgrade to Tails in the very near future - already have my two 8 GB sticks. <br />I also wholeheartedly agree with xpat. Security should be taken very seriously by everyone - if we have a culture on here that promotes complacency the future of SR would be on very shaky ground, however if everybody does their bit and the newbies are all assisted with any security-type issues I believe it is possible that this great thing we call the road could be here for the long run&nbsp; :)
