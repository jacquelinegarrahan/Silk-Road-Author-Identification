I think that I and all users who are in similar circumstances (showing that they are buyers) should have the freedom to discuss where they want.<br />If everything continues like this, I&#039;ll have to go to the Newbies section and post up to 50 ... as some have done.

That way the spam bots would never be able to get in any other part of the board (Unless the spammer already owns an account which can give karma, but in that case it would be easy to identify who that would be, I imagine).

				This 50-post rule, although well-intended I&#039;m sure, is unfortunate for the SR community. <br /><br />I don&#039;t personally have the time to sit here and rack up 50 posts on this forum, so I won&#039;t Therefore, the rest of the SR community will not get to see my reviews of vendors that I&#039;ve been ripped off by, leaving them free to rip off more customers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				ya that kinda sux.. spammers suck too tho, guess its too tricky for them to add a way around..<br /><br />just got a suggestion for the suggestions-forum if someone could forward it there lol:<br />to add a &quot;last login&quot;-feature. I realize adding a &quot;last login from IP&quot; wouldn&#039;t work,&nbsp; but a &quot;you last logged in X days/weeks ago&quot; (or just the date) could be a nice security feature.. like if someone has ur user/pass but is w8ing to get ur pin somehow (like a keylogger), so its possible to notice if someone else has logged in with ur account and such.

It would show them as hidden but with an option to still view it. Easily implemented on the client-side with some Javascript and CSS since the karma totals are shown anyway.
