				Hey. I am looking to move there after I graduate maybe (since supposedly they have an excess demand for my major). I am looking to get into banking or investing, but I am not quite sure how easy it would be to get a job down there. On one hand, the average salary is around $3600 a month, and a comparison shows many making at least 21k a year, but the median pay was 24k. My question is that is what is the going rate for a college graduate down there, who graduate from a decent B school? (BA) . I am looking into Mexico City, but I am open to others. Any thoughts on this?

				I agree. Los Cabos, Puerto Vallerta, Cancun, and Mexico City sound interesting. When I visit, I want hit up a few hookers ,&nbsp; maybe do some site seeing and then maybe screw a friend of mine down there ;) . But if you could earn $3600 a month and live on a lot less, you would be loaded, and could then use that money to build wealth . I don&#039;t know, but I have heard conflicting reports on MX City, where i want to visit.

				Well, I am curious about it for vacation in the short term, and maybe living there long term. I just wanted input, mostly about jobs, but on other things as well.On the subject you brought up, I heard that they had the second largest number of hookers in the world, next to Thailand.

				As long as you&#039;re not rich or slangin&#039; drugs on someone elses turf you are pretty safe in Mexico. Just follow common sense. Mexican cities have good areas and bad, just like anyother city in the world. Plus, crime over there doesn&#039;t like messing with foreigners versus locals, more of a risk.

				Yes, some parts of Mexico are a hellhole; although it depends on how you define &quot;hellhole&quot;. Other parts are great. If you&#039;re looking to move down here to make money with legitimate work then most of the time you&#039;ll be better off staying in the States (if that&#039;s where you&#039;re from). The best way to make legitimate money down here is if you own your own business, have a website and all your clients are from other areas of the world such as the U.S., Europe, etc. (countries with prospective clients that will pay good money for your services). This way you can live in Mexico, enjoy the benefits of being in Mexico (if you like that sort of thing) but have your clients from other areas of the world who are willing to pay top dollar for your services. Most companies in Mexico don&#039;t like paying top dollar for services (though there are exceptions). But for the most part, you&#039;ll find better paying clients outside of Mexico. <br /><br />For the most part they are required to give all jobs to Mexicans before they do someone from a different country unless there is no specific Mexican people to fill the required jobs. <br /><br />Business dealings in Mexico are also very different. It&#039;s a whole different culture with their own set of cultural expectations. It also depends on what type of Mexican you&#039;ll be dealing with. Will you be dealing with high-level executives? Or, will you be dealing with low-level managers? It makes a difference in how you would negotiate the deal. <br /><br />Personally, I love Mexico. It&#039;s a third world country and many parts of it is poor but the people can be very genuine, caring and authentic unless you live in some of the tourist towns or in a place where lots of Americans live. Then, you are more likely (but not guaranteed) to run into a different breed of Mexican. Mexico also has some beautiful places to live where you can buy a home for cheap. <br /><br />Like another person said here ... Make sure you use common sense. That&#039;s great advice!<br /><br />Another great thing about Mexico is that if you do have some money then you can pretty much get away with anything you want there. Most police are corrupt because they only get paid approx. $500 per month. So most of them are more than willing to take what they call &quot;mordidas&quot; or brides. Actually the word mordida translates to &quot;little bite&quot;. They only want a &quot;little bite&quot; out of your money and you can get away with a variety of things. Many politicians here too are corrupt and that can be a good thing if you know what you&#039;re doing. The mayors and governors of towns have alot of power as well and if you have them as friends or if you know the chief of police then all of the other police will not mess with you. It&#039;s all who you know there. That&#039;s the way it is in the underworld there. It&#039;s the same way in the business world there as well.<br /><br />Another positive is that you can get whatever you want down there and have the protection of the police at the same time!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I absolutely love it. I&#039;ve spent months in Mexico in the last 5 years. I&#039;ve been all over the country, I think I&#039;ve been to 22 of the 31 states,) but only spent a couple days in DF. (DF is is Distrito Federal, nobody calls it Mexico City, pronounced deh-efeh). I personally prefer the SW, along the Pacific coast in Oaxaca (pronounced wah-hah-cah)or Chiapas. Oaxaca City is the capital of Oaxaca and it&#039;s more than half a million people and at pretty high elevation so not as hot as the coast. <br /><br />After living in Canada my whole life, it&#039;s very liberating to be somewhere that nobody is nosy and you can just do your own thing. If you have a marketable skill and are interested in learning Spanish, I&#039;d say it&#039;s an ideal place for a younger person to work for a few years. I have better friends in Mexico than I&#039;ve ever made here at home. It takes a different approach to meet Mexican women, as the culture is much more traditional. Hookers / strippers are a different story, one of my best trips involved shacking up with a hooker for a few weeks who couldn&#039;t stand the stupid bitches she was living with, so she stayed with me at my apartment and really opened my eyes.

				You could probably live comfortably on 3600 a month in the DF. But I don&#039;t think you would be &#039;wealthy&#039; or live in luxury by any means. It would probably be the equivalent of making 60k in a low to medium cost of living city in the US. The DF has expensive areas, just like any metropolis, and also very poor areas (like every latin american city)<br /><br />I would do it if I were you, you can only go up from there
