				I am going to take 3 (Gandalf print) tonight&nbsp; I am really excited to try it to see how it compares to the stuff I had from the West Coast.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the measurement was and I am really curious to see if this is stronger.

I love reading them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />After about two months of research I placed my first order with Haizenberg.&nbsp; I got a 10 strip (Gandalf print)&nbsp; The first thing I noticed when I compared them to what I already had was the hits were bigger, almost twice the size.&nbsp; I was second guessing taking 3 hits but I am not a lightweight.&nbsp; I discussed it with my brother and we decided FUCK IT!&nbsp; We can handle our shit and we were in a very safe environment.<br /><br />Before we took them I made sure my house was clean, I hate tripping in a mess.&nbsp; I chose all the music I wanted to listen to and put it in order from least heavy to heaviest.&nbsp; I chose some DVD&#039;s.&nbsp; Planet Earth, a really sick claymation DVD by Bruce Bickford called Prometheus Garden, and NAQOYQATSI.&nbsp; I also go out some of my art books, a kaleidoscope...well you get the idea.<br /><br />Everything was in order and we dropped.&nbsp; About 40 minutes later I started feeling a mild euphoria.&nbsp; My vision started to blur a little and I noticed two faces kissing.&nbsp; When I focused in on the faces, it was a candle (not lit) I knew it was starting to kick in.<br /><br />I went outside and unfortunately there are a lot of bright street lights.&nbsp; When&nbsp; I look at the lights it&#039;s hard to describe what happens.&nbsp; It happens to me every time but my brother said he couldn&#039;t see it.&nbsp; When I look at them I see these really thin threads of color that connect from the lights to my eyes in a rainbow pattern. <br /><br />THIS ACID IS VERY VISUAL.&nbsp; I usually don&#039;t have visuals like this unless I take mushrooms or candy flip.&nbsp; They were the FACES EVERYWHERE type of visuals.&nbsp; The weather was perfect outside and there were some really kick ass clouds so I layed on my grass for a little while to get a better view of them.&nbsp; The holes in the clouds would become the eyes of the faces.&nbsp; They were all the same face even though the clouds were different sizes.&nbsp; But as soon as I would see the faces, they would change.&nbsp; They kept changing about every 5&nbsp; seconds.&nbsp; At one point I was seeing a bunch of puppy dog faces with sad eyes.&nbsp; I also saw all these thin fibers like I was seeing in the lights connecting all the clouds together.&nbsp; My brother was just standing there watching me lay on the ground and it made me uncomfortable so I got up and we went back inside.<br /><br />I was looking at a painting of Mary Magdalene in this art book that I have.&nbsp; When I stared at her face she would keep changing in between being a man and a woman.&nbsp; &nbsp;It looked like the top half of her face was a female and the bottom half of her face was a male.&nbsp; It was like two totally different paintings.&nbsp; I stared at her and she kept morhping back and forth, when she would turn into a man I could even see a 5 o&#039;clock shadow on her. <br /><br />I put on the NAQOYATSI DVD and we found it hilarious.&nbsp; I have never watched this with the sound on but the whole movie seems like it is purposely trying to trip you out, it&#039;s really great to watch while you are tripping.&nbsp; There are even psychedelic babies if you can believe that.&nbsp; I got tired of music after about 6 hours so we watched some movies.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meet the Fockers, Cyrus, and Coneheads.<br /><br />I had a GREAT time.&nbsp; Everything about this acid felt so clean and natural.<br /><br />Thanks for spreading the love Haizenberg.<br />

				I did Haizen&#039;s LSD last Friday. I took two blotters and I didn&#039;t seem to feel much, then out of no where at around the 2 hour mark everything in my room started moving, I added around 50mg of Addy&#039;s DMT to the trip and I literally sat in a room full of ghost-people dancing around me for 15 minutes while my entire room was changing colors, then they all went away suddenly and the L trip got ever stronger. It was magical, I still have 3 blotters of his left and I&#039;m doing them again this week. Great shit! Stealth wasnt bad either

I took two blotters and I didn&#039;t seem to feel much, then out of no where at around the 2 hour mark everything in my room started moving, I added around 50mg of Addy&#039;s DMT to the trip and I literally sat in a room full of ghost-people dancing around me for 15 minutes while my entire room was changing colors, then they all went away suddenly and the L trip got ever stronger. It was magical, I still have 3 blotters of his left and I&#039;m doing them again this week. Great shit! Stealth wasnt bad either<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am kinda scared to try DMT

				I intend to but not in the near future. Not because I&#039;m not in the right state of mind but because there is just so much stuff to find out... What kind to use, how to properly burn it, etc etc... And also I&#039;m find with the drugs I&#039;m doing now, they are very enjoyable... :)

				Took 4 of Haizenbergs Hoffmans 100ug and went on a spiritual hike in the Garden of the Gods. Most unreal experience of my life. My buddy took 2 said it was the best L hes ever had. Just my 2 cents.
