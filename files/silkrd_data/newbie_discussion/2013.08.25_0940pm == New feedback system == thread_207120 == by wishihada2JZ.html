				I think it&#039;s great, i like the idea of feedback being final, gives incentive to wait till you can try the product before you leave your feedback, and the buyer stats on feedback are great too, will help avoid spam feedback used to boost seller&#039;s ratings. <br /><br />Anyone else have thoughts?

				I really do not like that feedback is set in stone.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say I accidentally give a&nbsp; vendor a 4/5 or 2/5 instead of a 5/5. Simply, I just pushed the wrong button and made a mistake. I, as the buyer, have some pretty large stats that will HEAVILY alter a vendors stats. Now, since I was careless, I ruined a vendors score and can&#039;t go back and change it.<br /><br />This is a rare mistake, but then again I see so many people FE just because they finalize the wrong transaction.. COME ON PEOPLE!

That idea sounds like a solution to the problem of accidentally leaving a lower rating than intended. <br /><br />The reasoning behind having feedback final is to avoid some emotional buyers that get impatient and leave low ratings because their product is still in transit, which hurts a seller&#039;s potential business during the time said buyer&#039;s purchase is in the mail. With set in stone feedback I&#039;d think there would be less of this, i.e. buyers would wait to receive the product to leave feedback, and there would be less emotional rating bashing because a buyer wouldn&#039;t want to be blacklisted.<br /><br />Just my .0002 BTC :)

				Possibly the buyer and vendor can come to an agreement and urge a moderator to fix the mistake. That is my only problem with the new system.<br /><br />I have full trust in DPR to make the correct changes!

				Maybe you should be able to change the rating #, but not the text, in case you change your mind on the rating.
