				Are there any options to move bitcoins into an anonymous bank account and then withdraw cash at an atm?&nbsp; Several grand a month?<br /><br />I know about green dot, money paks etc.&nbsp; But those require a ssn for more than $500<br /><br />Any ideas?

				Check the money section of SR.&nbsp; There are numerous vendor who sell Visa Cards w/IBAN.&nbsp; The cheaper options allow for only small balances and withdrawls but if you spend more, you can find some with unlimited or at least high enough there shouldn&#039;t be a problem.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t purchased myself but am looking to here soon.
