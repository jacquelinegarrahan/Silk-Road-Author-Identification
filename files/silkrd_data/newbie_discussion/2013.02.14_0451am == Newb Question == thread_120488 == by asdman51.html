				Hello all,<br /><br />Still learning the ways to the road, and just wanted to get feedback on something...<br /><br />The most difficult process it seems for myself, is getting some bitcoins in the first place.&nbsp; The method I have come up with that I am planing on using would go like this:<br /><br />&nbsp;Bank Account-&gt;Dwolla-&gt;Mt. Gox-&gt;blockchain.info-&gt;SR<br /><br />Does this seem like an acceptable route, or should I be considering something else?<br /><br />Not sure if it matters, but I am in the US.<br /><br />Thanks for your time!

				Plenty of other threads on this... but with that said, why not:<br /><br />(Use Cash)&nbsp; Bitinstant → Walmart → Instawallet/Blockchain/Email/whatever → SR <br /><br />Or just... <br /><br />Bitinstant → Walmart&nbsp; → SR <br /><br />Just fill in bogus ID info/Phone # for Bitinstant and at Walmart.&nbsp; <br /><br />I myself just prefer to keep my real info totally unconnected.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				If you are near a bank of america I highly recommend Blue Sky Traders.&nbsp; You can make an anonymous deposit to their accnt at the counter in a BoA, walk out, go home, and the coins are usually waiting for you.&nbsp; And mmm it feels so good.

				Well, what I was thinking of doing, but was kind of sketch because of the link to my bank account was the following steps:<br /><br />1.) Link bank account to dwolla<br />2.) deposit funds from bank account to dwolla<br />3.) transfer funds from dwolla to mtgox or bitinstant<br />4.) convert funds to bitcoins and send to blockchain wallet<br />5.) send bitcoins to SR from blockchain<br /><br />After looking closer at Mt. Gox, it looks like you need a verified account (requiring copy of photo id, etc) to even do the transfer from Dwolla, so that doesn&#039;t seem like an option anymore.<br /><br />The other options you guys mentioned sound a bit safer, so I think I will look at those more closely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for your help, and I apologize for being lazy and not really searching around for this info.

				I&#039;ve been using BitInstant -&gt; Walmart -&gt; SR using fake info and cash.&nbsp; I&#039;m torn between using fake/real info.&nbsp; Real info leaves a trace even paying cash but what do you do when you make a large deposit using fake info and the coins don&#039;t show up? <br /><br />Also I would give Blue Sky Traders a shot but there are no B of A&#039;s around here&nbsp; :-\
