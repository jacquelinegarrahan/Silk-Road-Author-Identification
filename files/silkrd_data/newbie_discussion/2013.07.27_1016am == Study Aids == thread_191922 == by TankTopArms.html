				Good morning bros (5 am here) I&#039;m looking for study aids similar to adderall but preferably cheaper. I hear most stimulants have similar effects, but would like some other options. <br /><br />Give me your opinions, experiences, reviews or comments.

				I recently purchased some amphetamine sulphate powder for just this purpose.&nbsp; It&#039;s super cheap and is essentially identical to Adderall in terms of effects.&nbsp; Amphetamine sulphate is usually a racemic mixture of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine.&nbsp; Adderall is roughly 75% dexto- and 25% levoamphetamine.<br /><br />I purchased about 10g (which is a lot, typical doses range from 10mg-80mg) for just over $100.&nbsp; Really pure stuff, as well.
