				I&#039;ve always wondered, what stops a person from taking like half a tab, waiting an hour, then taking more to get where they want to be? Same with shrooms (but actually easier due to the come up being quicker). Take a couple grams, see where you are, then take more if you want.<br /><br />It seems like people are always like, &quot;I took 3 hits of acid because I didn&#039;t know the potency and had a bad trip.&quot; Well why not just take gradual doses instead? I&#039;ve read stories of people taking 1 hit and being so far gone that they never trip again, and then I&#039;ve read stories where they had to take 5 tabs and an eighth of shrooms to get to the same place, so it seems safer to do it this way.<br /><br />Is there something I&#039;m missing? I get that it can sort of be a pain in the ass, but to me that&#039;s totally worth it if I can avoid ruining psychedelics for me forever.

				a lot of psychedelics dont kick in like the traditional drugs such as cocaine or weed where you can sniff a bump, wait 2 minutes then do another one and get even higher or sniff a bump, wait for it wear off and then do another one and get equally as high as the first one<br />you cant really &quot;re-up&quot; on acid or shrooms well. they dont have the desired effects<br />same is true for dosing multiple days in a row. your not going to get the same effect.<br />i do agree with you about starting small and working your way up. smart thing to do. but what i do is take 1/2 a dose for example and then ride it out, wait a month and then next time increase my dose accordingly <br />i cant speak for others but this is why i dont re-dose on lsd or shrooms. that being said, i have done it in the past and i find it works better with shrooms. i have spent nights just munching on a big bag of mushrooms like it was bag of chips but it gets progressively more wasteful as the night goes on <br />&nbsp;

				Once you ingest tryptamines your body immediately starts to build a tolerance as it is metabolizing it. For me, 3 days and all tolerance seems to have cleared.&nbsp; So if you start with say a half tab, then when you re-dose you have to take at least double the first dose.&nbsp; Although for most people this doesn&#039;t work, including myself. Its either all at once or not at all...my advice, for newbies is start slow. I cannot imagine anything worse than having my first psychedelic be too intense.&nbsp; Get used to the feelings and effects, then go for broke!

Redosing later usually leads to an extended trip rather than higher intensity.
