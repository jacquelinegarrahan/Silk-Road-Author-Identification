				Code doesn&#039;t require FE! There&#039;s a link to my vendor page in my signature. Are you going to make a list of vendors that do not require FE in your first post? That would be cool if you did that, I&#039;m sure all the vendors would appreciate it.

I just joined today. I do not require FE. I appreciate any promotion I can get in the forum of any kind. I&#039;m sure any other vendors would also appreciate it. Just list vendors as you find them and ones that post in this thread. It may help you get to 100 posts quickly as well since you should have posts to respond to. Thanks!

				Cannabis vendor here.&nbsp; I am not allowed to ask for FE, and don&#039;t plan on it in the future unless confronted with shady people ordering.<br /><br />Right now I have top shelf indoor Blue Dream Haze, I&#039;m putting up another strain in a few days once some sample reviews start trickling in.

				I for one do not on my regular items, and I kow qualitymeds does not and ppharm do not also. Natasha as well now that I think about it. Just read vendor pages, you will find plenty of honest vendors who don&#039;t require FE.

				I&#039;d like to make a disclaimer first:<br /><br />I have not read their profile pages on their new buyer policy so you should read it before placing any orders. <br /><br />Now that&#039;s out of the way I&#039;ll say QualityMeds : Super fast shipping and fresh authentic pharmaceuticals<br /><br />Liston: Authentic meds with great shipping. I&#039;ve give a couple out here and there and those folks who got them from me has said they are better then the ones they get prescribed. When I say great shipping I must confess I have not bought any of his listings that were not shipped from with in the states<br /><br />PrivateReserve: New vendor and the new vendors can&#039;t ask for FE until they have 55 transactions. His shipping is great and so is his OG Kush. He did have some .01 samples left last time I looked. Mine weighed over a gram. I got him featured in my TopVendors thread now. The link is in my sig below<br /><br />&nbsp;

				You may have to place a small initial order and FE to get you started. Pick a local vendor with good reputation. If you can&#039;t afford to lose a few $ then you probably shouldn&#039;t be on the road.

				KarmaPharm for MDMA<br />KwikEmart for MDMA pressed pills <br /><br />Both of their stuff tested and rolled good. KarmaPharm stuff is the winner for me though.

				Jesus of Rave doesn&#039;t require you to finalize early. It&#039;s worth sending vendors a message asking if they will want you to FE for your first order.

				There seem to be quite a few UK sellers that do not require FE. The best thing to do, is to check out a vendor&#039;s profile and read their various T&amp;C&#039;s before even checking out the items themselves. Will save you a lot of time.
