				Anyone taken it? Good experiences, bad? Suggestions?<br /><br />I&#039;ve had one, took about 11-12mg and had an absolutely amazing time. I was surrounded by good friends on 2C-B though, so I think it&#039;s kind of hard to screw up a night like that. :-)<br /><br />It definitely took about 4 hours or so to kick in, but after about 6, I was having a blast! I saw the craziest hallucination I think I&#039;ve ever seen with my eyes open: I was putting on a Poolside (awesome band) mixtape (free on soundcloud), and no shit, the album art just starting having a party. I nearly dropped my phone, the people were just moving all over, dancing, serving drinks, right there on my phone screen! My roommate saw me staring at my phone with this look on my face, he came over and tried to tell me that it was just the album picture, but he wasn&#039;t fooling me, there was a party on my phone screen.<br /><br />Album art in question:<br />http://www.echoparkrecords.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/poolside-night.jpg<br /><br />Highly recommended mixtape:<br />http://soundcloud.com/poolside/night-mixtape

				I recommend P! Dose-response curve is supposed to hella steep, according to erowid trip reports, anything over 14-16mg is running into intense territory, so titrate carefully!

				Is there much of a difference between 2CP, 2CI and 2CB ? Having never done any of them, I&#039;m curious.

				Yes, there is. Personally, I can only speak to B and P, maybe someone else can chime in.<br /><br />For my money, 2C-B is literally the most pleasant experience on the planet. Big doses, small doses, it&#039;s just wonderful. Visuals are kind of fun, not super hallucinatory like mushrooms or something, but very fun. I enjoy the visuals on the B more than acid. Also, the closed eyes are very good, especially if you push the dose. It&#039;s great for taking in a show, just dance all night, body feels great. Sex is amazing on it. And it was one of the drugs they used for psychotherapy back in the early 80s; it has that same dissolving power of personal boundaries just like MDMA (except it lasts a good 4-6 hours, depending on the dose), so enjoy a good conversation on it!&nbsp; It takes a good hour or so for it to kick in for me, and, as with pretty much every other psychedelic, smoking cannibas is always recommended!<br /><br />P is a whole &#039;nother creature. It took a solid 4 hours or so before I even felt anything, but once it kicked in, I was tripping for a good 8 hours, lingering effects for another 4. Much more in the department of open eye visuals (see my above description). I&#039;ve only tried it once, but am very much looking forward to doing it again.<br /><br />And if you&#039;re into the science/pharmacokinetics of these things, we can get into that too if you want.<br /><br />And as with all psychotropics, erowid is a great place to start!

				In spite of my medical background, I&#039;m a little slow on the pharmacokinetics (&quot;Hmm... huh... mm-hmm... yep... I recognize some of these words!&quot;), but Erowid&#039;s never steered me wrong yet (I really should consider more chem and related courses).<br /><br />I was recommended to 2CB awhile back (friend of mine did say it was the best sex they&#039;d ever had while on it), although mild hallucination aside, it sounds a bit like MDMA in terms of duration and relaxation of irrational worries. Elsewhere, another friend told me about doing some, but apparently overdid the dose and ended up thinking they were in a space ship and couldn&#039;t leave the building (or was it a trailer or RV? Can&#039;t remember) because they&#039;d fall into space and be lost. Goes to show you to watch your dose, I guess. On the other hand, it certainly sounds like a small dose will go a long way.<br /><br />&nbsp;2CP meanwhile sounds... interesting. Not nearly as much able to schedule for a short-term fun event, but the effects sound much more shroomish, albeit a lot more duration?

				For me, even with a well-timed booster dose or two, molly never lasts more than 3 or 4 hours, with acute effects definitely gone by hour 3. Seriously though, I cannot recommend B enough. It&#039;s not the same as a good trip (several of my friends call it rolling instead of tripping on B), so there&#039;s still a place for tryptamines and LSD in my life, but for a good time, call B, she won&#039;t let you down.<br /><br />And yes, in general the dose-response curves on the phenethylamines is much steeper than the tryptamines; the recommended dose for P is around 10mg, but when you read the &quot;bad&quot; trip reports on erowid, they start at around 14mg. The cool thing is that it takes so long to kick in that depending on the setting, you can realistically forget you took anything, which is awesome IMHO.<br /><br />P lasts even longer than acid for me, but again, that 4-hour come up is weird. I took it with my friends who were all doing B, and I dosed up hours before they did and I still was the last one to start peaking!

				Hmm... curiouser and curiouser. B definitely sounds attractive, and if it has even longer a duration and more impressive effect than MDMA, well-worth it perhaps. (So long as you don&#039;t go overboard, yeh?)<br /><br />Wonder why the delay in P, meanwhile... did your friends take a different dose than you (or how about their relative weight, experience, and other intakes of fluid and food? There&#039;s got to be some related delay there as its being run through the system if there are other priorities taken by the digestive and circulatory system. Some people--myself included--are also chemically lightweight, so that might have been a factor in their regard vs your own.)<br /><br />What about the comedown? Molly did leave me feeling very mellow the next day, and I just wanted to kick back and take a nap (and some others who try to chase Molly&#039;s tail end up with temporary but severe depressive symptoms due to serotonin depletion...), so I&#039;m wondering about the aftereffects of B or P in comparison from an anecdotal standpoint...

				Never tried it! It&#039;s on my list though, possibly. So many beautiful options to explore! 2C-B is a favorite though.

Went to see Papadosio last week on 20 mg, had a blast-and-three-quarters. ;-) Seriously, the only difference was the higher dose was much stronger visually and lasted longer, may have been a little dancier.<br /><br />Side note: I&#039;ve noticed that the phenethylamines leave your appetite much more intact than do trypatimes, like the various psilocin analogues, or LSD. I think I ate two decent size meals during the P trip, had no issues. Mushrooms, I eat like a bit of something.

				Hah, yep, I&#039;d been reading that right after I was posting here last night. It&#039;s good to know that MDMA and several other substances have such a high LD50 (aside from the risks of hyperthermia and electrolyte imbalance if you drink too much water on Molly), but it does suck that it&#039;s easy to trip past a &#039;safe&#039; range and into something much less pleasant.<br /><br />The sudden veering into more worrisome territory does remind me a little of overdoing shrooms; when that happened I ended up... seriously dissociating for awhile, and some things like certain music or objects just made me very uneasy.
