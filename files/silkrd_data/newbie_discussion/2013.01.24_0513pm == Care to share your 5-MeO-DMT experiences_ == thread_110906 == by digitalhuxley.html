				I&#039;m curious about this substance - have heard that it can be both petrifying and very zen at the same time.&nbsp; For those who have taken it, I imagine words are a pretty ridiculous medium to try to get across how you found it, but would you give it a try?

				Hey bud, I&#039;ve had the pleasure of 5-meo three times, and countless times with regular Dimitry. You have to be in the right space and frame of mind when you do this stuff. You have to be willing to surrender to what its going to show you. The more in control you try to be the more of a bad journey you&#039;ll have. My first encounter was about 5 or six years ago. It is an experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. I was with a small group that discussed shaman rituals and psychedelics, at the time I had no idea about any of this stuff whatsoever, I didn&#039;t even do marijuana, the extent of my knowledge on psychedelics and stuff was extremely basic. For some reason when they started to talk about dmt I was strangely drawn to it. The group spoke for about an hour and we broke for lunch. At around noon on a Tuesday or Wednesday I went on a knowledge binge similar to Neo in the matrix. I was on the computer and researched everything I could about dmt. In a few hours I knew about Terrence Mckenna, Tikhal and Alexander Shulgin, Ayahuasca, the bufo alvarius toad, etc. I went back to the group the next day and told them lets do it, they all looked at me in shock because I was the newbie, rookie, total amateur , none of them had ever done it before either mind you but they knew&nbsp; more about it than I did. The rest of them were nervous and I was gung ho. <br /><br />&nbsp; Anyway the group of four of us decided to it and we were lead by a trained shaman so we had guidance and safety. We went through a bunch of rituals yada-yada, one of my buddies went first, then i went second. I inhale as big as I possibly could and held for as long as I could. Within 5 seconds everything begins to dematerialize almost similar to being submerged in water. The thing about 5-meo is that it&#039;s so powerful its like taking an express elevator to the top floor which is where the god space is. Its very difficult to describe the experience except that is like being blasted out of a cannon you don&#039;t get a second to even begin to orient yourself with what’s going on and where you are, this is why you have to let it ride. Just trust that everything will be okay. Not much that I can remember while I was in the god space,( pieces of it came to me over the course of a few days after), when I came down and was focused back into the physical world, I understood that I had a death experience, its exactly what it feels like when you die, it’s not scary, its peaceful, beautiful, amazing. As I became more oriented everyone in the group was around me and I just blurted “this is a fucking joke” and everyone started laughing. I was referring to the fact that people, all of us, stress over and fear death and if we knew what it was really like we’d probably slap ourselves and say snap out of it. It’s absolutely absurd which everyone in the group understood and hence the laughter. I continued to lay there for a few more minutes and you feel quite orgasmic.&nbsp; It’s as if I was bathing in pure god force, love and light, and after coming down and being more physically focused it just felt like I was having the orgasm of my life every second for a couple of minutes which gradually faded. Our guide began to talk to me to inform me a little bit about what I went through but I was still humming, I actually blurted out to him “shut the fuck up” in a joking manner because he was ruining it I just needed to be present with that feeling. I finally got up went to the bathroom and stood in the mirror for a minute and kept wondering what the fuck just happened it was the most amazing experience I’ve ever felt. I kept smiling, after a few minutes I started to cry, now I’m a pretty macho guy, not the most emotional fella but dude I was balling like a baby and I couldn’t understand why at the time. I had to pull myself together or at least I tried because one more person was about to go and I needed to be there, I walked out of the bathroom and just couldn’t stop crying and didn’t bother trying. I cried because I experienced god, experienced a greater part of myself, and was extremely humbled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to ramble on too much I can explain my other journeys that followed this one but this was my virgin experience and it was awesome, I’m still stalking 5-meo to this day which has led me to this site, unfortunately I have yet to find a vendor who has a good quality product its been disappointing because I’ve been searching for a couple of years now. If you have any questions or queries or know of a good vendor or source I much appreciate it if you can do it, please do it’s an experience you’ll never forget and something that not many people on this earth get an opportunity to try. But remember you have to be ready for it, you have to prep, its nothing to play around with it can be very dangerous, like I’ve seen some people need cpr type dangerous because they forget to come back to their body, do your research and be safe.&nbsp; Again I’m happy to share any of my other experiences, information or questions you may have, I’ve made my own dmt, done it a bunch of times, studied it etc. <br />Cheers<br />

				I&#039;ve yet to try it in normal-to-large sized doses. But at 3-5mg it produces pretty strong effects. It comes on very fast (under 30 seconds, vapourised) and lasts for around 3-4 minutes; coming down by the 5th minute with a 30min strong afterglow that fades off gently over the next few hours. I find it hard to link the events before the experience, and after it.. like everything that happened during the day before I vapourise, will feel like it happened yesterday after it&#039;s over.<br />I don&#039;t find the onset feelings very enjoyable. Lots of confusion, intensity, heaviness, and feels difficult to feel; almost feels toxic while you&#039;re under the effects. Before it fades it usually feels really good but still intense. I notice the initial negative feelings diminish after repeated use at the same dosage. Has that very real feeling, so it can be hard to understand you took a drug until it starts fading.<br />The afterglow is very &#039;zen&#039; for me. Super easy to fall asleep afterwards... super hard to get up and move for the next 30-60mins. Of course you can quite easily, but I always just want to stay laying down and bask in it. The afterglow seems to be equivalent to the strength of the peak. 3mg for me will have an afterglow effect but 5-6mg makes the afterglow quite strong.<br /><br />Please note all my experiences come from low doses. Descriptions aside, it is very strong; I recommend at least trying a low dose first so you won&#039;t be caught by surprise in a bad way. I never find myself wanting to go back for more just to get a better idea of what it&#039;s like. It has potential to be addictive for sure though.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110906.msg780070#msg780070">Quote from: spacecowboy on January 31, 2013, 04:51 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don’t want to ramble on too much I can explain my other journeys that followed this one but this was my virgin experience and it was awesome, I’m still stalking 5-meo to this day which has led me to this site, unfortunately I have yet to find a vendor who has a good quality product its been disappointing because I’ve been searching for a couple of years now.

				My 2nd Experience with 5-MeO-DMT.&nbsp; Thanks to RINRAN<br />--------------<br />Setting: My room<br />Set:&nbsp; Two friends and I smoking DMT and 5-MeO-DMT<br />Dosage:&nbsp; 20mg of 5-MeO-DMT<br /><br />Experience:<br />This was my 2nd experience with 5-MeO-DMT, I&#039;ve done NN-DMT twice as well, but this experience trumps all of them in terms of intensity.&nbsp; I documented the whole thing, and wow let me just say fucking wow. <br /><br />I took a 3 hits out of the pipe, and as I was handing it back to my friend I laid down.&nbsp; Then the room started filling with electricity.&nbsp; In-between all the atoms in the air this electricity started vibrating and along with it came these pulses of energy surging throughout my body.&nbsp; I laid back looking at the ceiling watching it shrink down towards me.&nbsp; It was already so intense, all I could do was repeat &quot;it&#039;s okay...oh my god, it&#039;s okay.&quot;&nbsp; I repeated this for minutes on loop as my world was raped by 5-MeO-DMT.<br /><br />During this time, like with all breakthrough experiences, I had no idea what I was, who I was or where I was.&nbsp; I remember feeling self-conscious bc none of my friends said shit when they smoked it.&nbsp; I, on the other hand, could not stop saying &quot;Oh my god. It&#039;s okay, you asked for this...it&#039;ll be over soon&quot;&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t simply think these words.&nbsp; I HAD to say them.&nbsp; At some point during the experience I remember thinking &quot;this is what death feels like.&quot;<br /><br />That thought would not stay out of my mind, and I still feel like I was at the edge of death.&nbsp; 5-MeO-DMT is way more intense than DMT in my opinion and honestly is a little scarier. <br /><br />After you smoke it, it feels like your consciousness descends into the sublayers of your mind and piece by piece of your brain&#039;s systems shut down.&nbsp; Your sense of time is gone.&nbsp; Your sense of space is gone.&nbsp; Your memories are gone.&nbsp; Then you just are in this place, not seeing, because you don&#039;t have eyes...well you do, you just don&#039;t know what eyes are at this point.&nbsp; For some reason I felt like a chimpanzee, perhaps because my consciousness had descended into the lowest part of my brain.&nbsp; That&#039;s what any DMT is like for me, it&#039;s like you&#039;re on this journey through your mind for a minute or two until something brings you back.&nbsp; A feeling, a sound, a memory.&nbsp; Something reminds you that you are alive.&nbsp; You are a person, you have memories and a body and then slowly but surely your body and mind are given back to you.&nbsp; The closest thing I can compare this to is to say it&#039;s like being born again.&nbsp; I don&#039;t consciously remember what that was like, but I gotta believe that at some basal animalistic level we remember that experience and that feeling was very present during my trip. <br /><br />When I came out of it, I was so scared and relieved and shocked that all I could do was cry for 10 minutes straight.&nbsp; Now, I haven&#039;t cried in years probably, but that feeling that 5 MEO DMT gave me was the feeling that I just almost died, and the thought of that made me cry.&nbsp; I felt very lucky to have been shown what death was like and to have survived but being shown what death was like was not exactly a fun experience to expereince.&nbsp; To remember it is another story.&nbsp; Like with any intense Trip, in the moment, it&#039;s usually too much, but when you look back at it, you think &quot;yeah that was crazy, but it was also kind of cool.&quot;<br /><br />I was laugh/crying for some of it, but it was definitely one of the most intense experiences I&#039;ve ever ever ever had.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried almost every drug and that shit was so bananas I really had to write this trip report.&nbsp; I think it&#039;ll be a long long time before I ever do 5 MEO DMT again.&nbsp; DMT is another story but either way, what I got from that trip was bittersweet.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I did it, but it was the scariest thing I&#039;ve ever done.&nbsp;
