				Hi guys, due to the recent scams around and the drop in the ratings of some of the top MDMA vendors I am not sure who to purchase. I am looking for a trusted and friendly vendor who has good prices and quality. <br /><br />Thanks for your answers beforehand&nbsp; ;D

Well, Dutch Trade is in Germany, and while every vender I&#039;ve used has had quality shit,&nbsp; Dutch&#039;s prices for 5 grams lured me into giving the over seas/customs risk a shot. I&#039;m in the USA, and got my package on the 6th day from ordering, 10% heavy, and nice stuff. Others right now are seeing much larger shipping times ( beyond DT&#039;s control ) . So... if you are just looking to pick up a gram for the weekend and don&#039;t plan on buying quantity of mdma, I&#039;d say stay local: Dank hank, empathy, forever strung.. . but if you have patience ( I was expecting at least 12 days. It took six including a sunday ) then Dutch Trade has quality at a great price. I&#039;ve also read good things about Chemical Sisters. They are cheaper even than DT. I&#039;d love to know how the product compares to what I&#039;ve gotten here on the road. <br />&nbsp; Hope this helps .

And the reason I&#039;d stay local in that scenario, is because although the cost is a bit higher, the chances of you getting your package, and getting it faster, are greater. Generally speaking, of course.

				I get nervous thinking about purchasing when it is not local. Something about customs scares me. I guess though with good stealth and packaging it is relatively safe.
