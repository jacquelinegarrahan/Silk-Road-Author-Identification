				Give your postman a nice christmas card with a gift certificate and make sure you wave to your neighbors when they spot you. The trick is to appear as if things are normal.<br /><br />There are THOUSANDS of ebay sellers who are doing the exact same thing you are. Handing their packages to their mailman. It&#039;s not suspicious at all, unless you have strange odors emanating from poor packaging. I&#039;m sure on their delivery route they probably pick up hundreds of packages from people doing the same thing you are.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry so much about your mailman, rely on proper packaging and don&#039;t tip him off to anything with fake return addresses that don&#039;t match your own! Be smart, stay safe and best wishes brotha

				What exactly are you shipping? If it&#039;s weed then maybe it&#039;s time to sit down and re-think your strategy. If it&#039;s pills or powders, just make sure it&#039;s sealed properly and not placed into sloppy packaging!<br /><br />I personally wouldn&#039;t use my own return address but if you&#039;ve done everything right you won&#039;t ever need to!

				Yes real return addresses will be much less suspicious, as will printed postage as opposed to hand written.&nbsp; Junk mail goes everywhere all the time but rarely comes from residences, be creative but don&#039;t just make things up.
