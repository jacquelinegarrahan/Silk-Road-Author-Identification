				After previously purchasing alprazolam powder from the vender NurseJoy and receiving a bitter tasting powder with a consistency similar to talcum powder, and having an effect that was no doubt that of alprazolam, I felt pretty confident ordering again. The order I received next however, was certainly not alprazolam. <br /><br />My first alarm call came when looking at its consistency. Instead of the very fine powder one would expect, it had a gritty consistency, with large, half peppercorn sized solid clumps in it. The best way to describe what it looked like would be a crushed up pill. I then tried roughly four mg of the powder to find a slightly bitter, but a far different tasting powder to alprazolam. <br /><br />The effects started to hit about twenty minuets later and far from the relaxing, clear minded experience I&#039;m use to and look forward to with alprazolam, the best way I could describe this was not pleasant and similar being stoned on weed. I felt panicky and my partner commented on the redness of my eyes. I bring this up now because I&#039;ve noticed in their reviews, several others expressing doubt about whether their &quot;alprazolam&quot; is even a benzo. <br /><br />A lot of customers of theirs still seem satisfied, so whether those people are inexperienced with Xanax, or, it&#039;s only a certain percent who receive the false product I don&#039;t know. If anybody else has had a similar experience, then please share it and for those considering buying alprazolam powder from NurseJoy, please be careful.
