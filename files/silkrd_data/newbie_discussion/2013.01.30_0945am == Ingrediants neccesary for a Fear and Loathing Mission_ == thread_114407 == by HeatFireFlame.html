				Hey all, Saw the post what&#039;s your favourite movie to trip to, Well mine has to be fear and loathing in las vegas, Il walk around on acid for hours giving a running commentary like johnny depp does throughout the film for fucking hours.<br /><br />Anyhooo&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Was thinking about getting some more blotters and realized that il end up hitting some sort of mission this time, And if i was to have a suitcase full of ingredients, Like they do in the film, What would i need?<br /><br />so far i have<br /><br />Mescaline, Weed, Cocaine, LSD , The mad shit in the vial that makes mescaline look like nothing, whats that again? <br />&nbsp;

				Love that movie, they had Two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, 5 sheets of high powered blotter acid,&nbsp; A salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers, a quart of tequila, a&nbsp; quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. <br /><br />Not that you&#039;ll need all that for the trip.

				Yea that&#039;s the only drug I know that was made up for the movie.<br />No such thing as adrenachrome that I know of and I&#039;ve heard adrenaline isn&#039;t very recreational.

				Souns like a good plan.<br />I did acid, dmt and weed a few days ago. I trashed my room pretty good.<br />Can imagine that if you go a little further with the mescaline and the cocaine you can go full out.<br />Seems like a pretty good plan

				Wish mescaline was more available. The drug collection they had would be pretty hard to duplicate due to that.
