				Does anyone know of a way around the daily limit of $500 per customer?<br />Yes I&#039;m aware you could use a fake name, ect. But why do that when you&#039;re buying something legal: bitcoins. Your name doesn&#039;t stay attached to those coins and they can go around wherever. Maybe I&#039;m a crazy day trader trying to get in on this strange new market!<br /><br />Seems like Mt.Gox is no longer allowing new accounts. At least they haven&#039;t every time I have checked lately...

				Could you do several $500 bitinstant transactions?&nbsp; <br /><br />I know I read in the btc forums someone had help from bitinstant in breaking up there $2000 dollar payment into smaller payments, which I think consisted of doing 4 of those bitinstant transfer forms online then doing 4 money grams at walmart or whereever.<br /><br />At the end of the day if enough people do it, even if its illegal, nothing can be done about it. <br />

				Doing more than 1 $500 transaction (or 2 $500 transactions AT THE MOST) in a 24 hour period is asking for issues with their fraud filter.&nbsp; The second transaction will get &quot;stuck&quot; in it.

				I tried to do more than one (2@$500) and it said that it was an invalid request. It only allows one $500 transaction per day. I don&#039;t like paying taxes on my money, but as long as you&#039;re not dropping $500 a day, every day with money that you shouldn&#039;t have, it is going to be just fine. At least for now. Until the government makes the purchase of cryptocurrency illegal in all forms and just goes after any entity facilitating such transactions. <br />Someone somewhere needs to be able to cash it out for real life value, but for the rest of us it can be a currency that just exists in cyberspace.

				I believe if you load on too different btc addys, you can do as many as you like. <br /><br />Though what scout says is most likely correct. <br /><br />A few weeks ago i loaded $500 to my SR wallet, then immediately after another $500 to my blockchain wallet..then a few hours later another $200, also to my blockchain wallet, and everything went through perfectly, in record breaking time actually. <br /><br />&nbsp;I always use a bogus identity, always the same one.
