				Hey, <br /><br />I have always wanted to try good, clean cocaine, so for me it&#039;s pretty amazing to find it on SR. I have a couple of things I would like cleared up before placing my order though:<br /><br />Many of the vendors claim to they have pure cocaine. How pure is that 70-80 %? 90 %? It would be nice if someone who has tried it could tell me about the effects and doses used. A lot of people write in the reviews that the coke has a good smell - I find this weird, since pure cocaine should be odorless? Also, some people describe it as oily. Again, not a good thing, am I right or completely off??<br /><br />also, a vendor who sells very expensive and supposedly pure cocaine writes this:<br /><br />&quot;- RAW COCAINE CAN BURN IN YOUR NOSE<br />- RAW COCAINE MAKES YOU STAY AWAKE<br />- RAW COCAINE CAN GIVE YOU A SPEEDY FEELING<br />- YOU CAN GET A HEADACHE AND BACKACHE AFTER USING COCAINE<br />&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been informed that good cocaine should not burn in your nose and actually does not give you that speedy feeling that regular street cocaine gives you.<br /><br />Plus I just read a review on some cocaine saying that &quot;it wasn&#039;t as good as last batch&quot; and had a strong smell. <br /><br />Am I being naive thinking that the cocaine on SR is pure, just because the vendors say so? Please enlighten me!<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br /><br />

				Hello TheDudeChinaski,<br /><br />Welcome to the forum I which you a very happy experience here and on the marketplace too. Here&#039;s a thread you might find very useful &#039;Cocaine Lab Test Results&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0 PineappleLove patriotically posts &#039;dutch lab test&#039; results from different vendors all over the world , lab test results tell the transparent truth, you can&#039;t get much better than that. There&#039;s also a long running (it&#039;s 473 pages long!) cocaine review thread on the rumor mill &#039;SR Cocaine Vendors &amp; Reviews (Posts 1 &amp; 2 updated regularly.)&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.0 run by rem0ved, I appreciate both the hard work and effort PineappleLove and rem0ved put into running these threads smoothly, they&#039;re essential reads before you make your first coke purchase here, also another tip if you see a vendor you wish to research enter their name into the search box on the forum homepage to see if they&#039;ve got a review thread. What&#039;s pure cocaine like? Well, you&#039;ll never find 100% cocaine that&#039;s impossible, even the purest cocaine is about 95% pure, however cocaine in the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s does exist, you&#039;ve just got to do in-depth research first, not every claim a vendor makes about coke being crystal, shiny, oily, pure white, etc, is true, they&#039;re marketing terms all drugs have them, high purity coke is just that high purity coke, sometimes they&#039;ll use the marketing terms as it&#039;s what people can relate to they feel more inspired to purchase through these words rather than the term &#039;high purity coke&#039;. Be prepared when you try high purity coke for the first time the experience speaks for itself, it&#039;ll be unlike anything you&#039;ve ever tried before, enjoy the ride! I wish you all the best researching and hope your first experience with high purity coke is a very memorable one :)

				Yeah, lots of the vendors claim they have pure coke.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried several US vendors and here&#039;s my top 3. <br /><br />DrPvMd:&nbsp; #1&nbsp; &nbsp;He rates his gear on a scale of 1 to 10, and I&#039;ve found that to be pretty true to form.&nbsp; If he rates an 8, i&quot;m buying. <br />10Toes: #2&nbsp; This guy is very easy to deal with and totally dependable, and his coke is great too.&nbsp; <br />Pablo&#039;sPuro: #3&nbsp; This guy took forever shipping my stuff, but it did finally arrive and is quite nice.&nbsp; But it&#039;s a bit more expensive than the other 2. <br /><br />I should say also, that I don&#039;t like speedy coke. I like the smoother stuff, nice euphoria, not overwhelming and easy comedown.&nbsp; The three vendors above all provided coke that fit that bill.&nbsp; Hope that helps and let us know who you like, and why.<br /><br />Peace!

				Lol@richard. Pure cocaine is what I am really interested in. Can&#039;t get that shit for money or love round here in real life. It&#039;s all cut to f***.&nbsp; Will be jumping in and making my first purchase soon.<br /><br />Thanks for everyone who reports in on the quality of the products here. It&#039;s obvious that the site is run on trust so the more people give honest feedback on products the better the site in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Ribald

				I&#039;m not a big coke person, I&#039;ve done it 3 times before and enjoyed it to different extents, but I always wanted to try &quot;off the brick, uncut coke&quot;.<br /><br />Got 1G of the pure from Pablo and it is nothing like the other 3 times. The previous 3 time were more speedy and I kept wanting to do more until it was all gone. With Pablos pure it was sweet mellow bliss after a small 1/2 matchstick line without the &quot;one more line will get me just right&quot; attitude.&nbsp; I did 1/4 gram during the weekend and never jonesed for more. This G will go a long way for me.&nbsp; Oh yeah and the best thing was the come down, so smooth, no problems sleeping at all. <br /><br />Thanks to Pablo, for the experience, he seems a little overwhelmed so be patient with his shipping times.<br /><br />Next on my list is some LSD I ordered from LucyDrop, done shrooms a few times so I&#039;m excited to give L a try.<br /><br />Makes me angry that we can&#039;t go down to the corner drug store and pick this stuff up. Who has the right to tell me what I can do with my body! Thanks SR for making trying new things much more safe.

High purity coke is more expensive than street coke, that&#039;s a fact (unless your willing to wait for weeks for it to be delivered from a far flung place and order &#039;an amount&#039; then you can have a bargain but remember the waiting time), however in the long run it actually works out to be cheaper, a gram of street gear can be done very quickly, a gram of high purity coke between friends can last you all night long and if you&#039;re lucky you might even have a line left for the morning. It&#039;s like concentrated orange juice, the one litre bottles I get here once diluted make five litres, however if you have the concentrated orange juice on it&#039;s own it&#039;ll go five times as far, the same applies to coke if you think about it :)

				Pure Cola is very relaxing, mellow and just makes you feel on top of the world <br /><br />It hardens your ego, you think you&#039;re the coolest mofo on gods green earth, and it organises your thoughts. Instead of having yoru thoughts scattered all over your brain, it&#039;s like they&#039;ve been filed and colour coded.<br /><br />I lovez it lotzzz&nbsp; :-*

				You should consider cleaning the product yourself.<br /><br />Even if a vendor is selling you 70%, you could get it higher and lose the excess.<br /><br />I believe people use an acetone wash to this extent.
