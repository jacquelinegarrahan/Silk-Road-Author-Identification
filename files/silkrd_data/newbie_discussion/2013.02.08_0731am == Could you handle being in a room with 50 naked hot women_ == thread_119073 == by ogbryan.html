				Being a straight woman, i&#039;m sure I could handle it - i&#039;d probably feel really awkward though!<br /><br />I did a Spencer Tunick installation a few years ago and there was 800 of us (men and women), butt naked posing for his photo installation. I must say, it was very liberating :)

				&quot;Could I handle it...&quot; well, hmm. I&#039;ve been in a room with multiple dozens of naked women, and didn&#039;t bat an eye then (and I&#039;m not gay). Nice to have the eye candy though. So I guessed if you amped it to 50, it&#039;d be... nicer?<br /><br />(Worse is being in a too-busy gym when working out. The elevated heat, humidity, and locker-room smell is... ...unpleasant.)
