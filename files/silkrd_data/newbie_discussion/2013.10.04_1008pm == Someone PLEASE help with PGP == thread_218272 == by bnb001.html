				search GPG4Win, get it from the project official page. Look for the link to the GPG4Win Compendium - it&#039;s your instruction manual.<br /><br />Once it&#039;s installed etc import their key to your key ring then you can click &#039;message&#039; in cryptophane, type what you want, select who to encrypt it to from the keys in your ring, sign it, and it&#039;ll paste the encrypted message onto your clipboard. If you&#039;re already lost read the compendium from page 1.<br /><br /><br />*Edit Mac: nvm. Search GPG4Mac and try everything else the same? lol dunno

				When you say encrypt message on the clipboard - which clipboard? In which programme? How to encrypt with someones public key? So if someone says &#039;this is my public key &#039;xxxx&#039; please use it to encrypt emails to me&#039; - what do I do with it? Do I compose a message &#039;xxHi, how are you?xx&#039; so put my text in the middle of the big code they give me?<br /><br />I just dont get it?&nbsp; ???<br />

The only thing you&#039;re using the email for is to carry the encyption code to the person you wanna talk with. Doesnt have to be email, could be a forum msg, a IM msg or hell you could write the code down on paper and give them it.<br />&nbsp;You use public keys for people to encode the text they want to send to you and vice versa, you decrypt with you&#039;re private key that you never gie the password out for.
