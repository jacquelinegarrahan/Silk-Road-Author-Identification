				Post by: <strong>LawEnforcementAgent</strong> on <strong>March 20, 2013, 04:35 pm</strong>

				Hello SR Forums.<br /><br />I have a countless number of topics I want to address. First, to reiterate what has been said by Richard Feynman in the Meaning of It All: ideas do not last unless they are passed purposely and clearly from generation to generation. Second, for everyone that is participating on the SR marketplace, my first recommended reading is &quot;The Signal and the Noise&quot; by Nate Silver.<br /><br />That being said, I say again, Hello, and I hope you are all well.<br /><br />Do you see my username? You should assume every user could be LEOs. Until you (better) understand code, Linux, networking, law, psychology, sociology, and physics, you are at risk of losing your liberty, health--both mental and physical--and happiness (if you currently possess such a beautiful thing as that). You also put every honest citizen at risk of paying higher taxes, through legal fees, incarceration, rehabilitation, etc. Take a look at the global banking system: It exists because of greed and lack of foresight. Educated people have made terrible decisions out of self-interest or oversight, and now Cyprus, along with the EU is facing trouble. This is just one example of how education and personal responsibility--and empathy--can help make everyone&#039;s lives better.<br /><br />To the Dealers: plan on vacation(s) on a regular basis. Not regular vacations on a beach or camping trip, but a vacation out of town, cash only, where you think and plan on staying safe. Staying safe means staying out of trouble: Checking brake lights, paying your taxes, going to church, cleaning your house/apartment, cutting your hair, cleaning your clothes, shoes, etc. Blend in with your surroundings... Start a non-profit organization to help your community. Al Capone was put away for tax evasion, but every working stiff--and starving family--loved him because he opened up bread lines when the country was starving. People of Colombia loved Pablo Escobar because he put a lot of money into philanthropy. Money = power. Learn how to keep you money safe, but also how it helps keep you safe.<br /><br />OK... Here we go.<br /><br />Packaging. Receipts. Evidence.<br /><br />Read up on composting, as in organic gardening. When I throw away my mail, I make sure it&#039;s wet. I add coffee grinds, kitchen waste, vacuum bags, pet waste to the mix. Composting. Bacteria and fungi work for you to destroy evidence. Turn your trash into inadmissible rubbish. It also keeps your identity safe from scammers.<br /><br />I have at least one degree--in chemistry--and I hope to improve the movement here through education. The forums are missing a great deal of legal conversation that needs to be common knowledge--&quot;walking around knowledge&quot;--that everyone has in their frontal lobes all the time. If you don&#039;t want to go to local, state, or federal prison, then you need to develop your OCD and paranoia, but moderate it with a civil and professional demeanor. Conversely, if you commit felonies, then you should know the consequences NOW, instead of when the police come.<br /><br />I participate in the SR marketplace. I contribute to my local economy. I am prepared to go to federal prison (U.S.A.). I work out everyday. I am developing my own local legitimate business(es), turning drug $$ into economic and social success. I contribute to local charities, perform community service. My name is going to be almost impossible to tarnish if anything goes down.<br /><br />SECURITY<br /><br />I use PGP/GPG on every SR message I send. I use encryption on every digital device I touch. I have a very complicated scheme, including healthy diet, multivitamins, memory exercises, and I cannot emphasize this one enough: COUNTER INTELLIGENCE. I have hospitalized myself several times to provide medical evidence of my insanity: paranoid schizophrenia (it&#039;s a week or two in a psych ward where I don&#039;t have to cook/clean or talk to anyone... just think and plan and focus, while developing a special court case). <br /><br />If you are not willing to compete with former-special-forces LEOs, then you will be caught. If you are not preparing for Bitcoin collapse, then you will lose $$. If you are not learning Linux and programming, then you will fall behind and be caught. If you are not preparing for a massive SR sting, in which Federal LE starts handing out information to every local LEA in the nation, then you are dangerously naive.

				DOx<br /><br />4mg: Incredible experience. Intense and colorful visuals... not much different from shrooms/LSD/mescaline. Amphetamine intoxication is what really sets this drug apart.<br /><br />I do psych&#039;s by myself most of the time. It is a meditation. I&#039;ve done salvia, shrooms, LSD, and mesc, along with a few others that could have been any number of drugs. I do not recommend this to a first time user of psychedelics. I do not recommend frequent use of ANY psych. Frequent use can have irreparable effects on neural structure and function.<br /><br />After effects: sex drive plummeted for about 1 week.

				You Sir, sound like a complete lunatic! But that&#039;s a compliment believe it or not.<br />I would love to meet you and smoke a few bowls, I&#039;m sure there would be an endless supply of interesting conversations! <br />I don&#039;t out the kind of effort into staying discrete as you do, but where I&#039;m from I don&#039;t think I need to invest in it as much.<br />However much fun I would think it would be to meet you however, I am sure that can never happen as your paranoia about law enforcement would eliminate the possibility of ever meeting someone from here!<br />Have Fun!

				CannabisArbiter Review<br /><br />OK. So, I am satisfied with this vendor. The product I received the other day was reasonable and well priced. The stealth was satisfactory. Well vac-packed. No odors. Well concealed.<br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />I realize he has received some negativity lately, but what happens happens. Everyone has rough patches, and I think users on the Road should know this better than most people... if we can just think through all the drugs! : )<br /><br />Btw: My username... Yeah, I assume everyone here is LE, but I treat everyone with respect, as I do with people AFK. Everyone gets a smile. I incorporate that into my OCD personality. Professional, clean, happy. Share the love and knowledge the world has shared with me. (But seriously, like Cartmen, I fuckin&#039; hate hippies.)

				Smoking a joint yesterday... paranoia hit me. Be warned.<br /><br />We&#039;re all on here to get good drugs. I wanted some cocaine, so I tried a little bit through bcpltd. FEed, and it never showed up. So now I might have a bad address. My solution? Fucking work out like hell and get ready for the pen. But seriously, we&#039;re on an anonymous marketplace, with no government or public service to verify the quality or reliability of these drugs. How many people have run their newly purchased narcotics through a GC-MS or UV-Vis to verify the safety of their drugs?<br /><br />Is all the cannabis coated with JWH? or any of the myriad of synthetic THC &quot;bath salts&quot; that have flooded the market in the past years? This is a serious concern. A health concern, since synthetic cannabinoids can cause kidney and liver failure. While I fucking got high out of my mind, I couldn&#039;t help feeling sick to my stomach with anxiety over this.<br /><br />This is exactly what FARC and the Mexican drug cartels didn&#039;t want to happen--allowing people to poison the American drug trade. It&#039;s been a growing concern since 9/11 that some sinister mother fucker(s) are going to dope our dope. Now, everyone is selling/buying from anonymous Eddy. A glowing review is left for a vendor before the seller winds up in the ER or dead.... then no more feedback.<br /><br />Wow, what a perfect system. Encrypted devices. Anonymous OS platforms. Further encryption and anonymity. That would be next to impossible to even link it to the SR--or to anyone else. It&#039;s time we start making this public. There needs to be a public service dedicated to drug control--ensuring that the narcotics we consume are the narcotics we INTENDED to consume.

				Hey don&#039;t call FE&#039;ers (for first time/ less than 5 buys/bad stats) thugs! I&#039;m planning to set up an acct with some.. coveted opioid stuff if it goes well and frankly, I&#039;m more scared of you guys than you oughta be of me, seriously. I&#039;ve been screwed so many times (not on the road here), but with supposed friends and always dealt ppl straight. It sucks. I really have well over 50 posts, I just wanted to change my damn forum name and this stupid rule didn&#039;t exist a year ago. Grrr so I can still go where I want with this name but I want this name darnit! I still have my old one though so.. eh chugging along.<br /><br />If I get set up, I was planning to say EVERYTHING has tracking (US only) Priority mail (maybe included maybe not, not sure, and MAYBE express overnight. The wares? Hehehehe.. watson GEL fent 100mcg patches, Asian triangle H if I can pull it off, and *maybe*- just maybe- some very very special 1600mcg COMPOUNDED &quot;fentanyl lollipops&quot; (the compounding pharmacy calls em lollipops, lol). Not like the other ones from a normal pharmacy, waaay better taste (like rainbow kind of), definitely stronger, but.. VERY expensive for just me to buy so that&#039;s up in the air; I might not sell cause I need them too).. and maybe say FE is required for ppl with less than 5 successful buys or weird stats. I&#039;ve seen ppl ask for 10 buys for escrow, and the thing is, I&#039;m disabled and stuff... I can&#039;t afford to have somebody forget to finalize or get locked out of the site, that&#039;s my main deal (my other forum name is emera1d- see I just wanted to change ONE LETTER and I have to do this stuff with 50 posts...) So sometimes depending on the seller, it&#039;s just us trying to protect ourselves but I will say that&#039;s PROBABLY not the majority of vendors out there!

				Man is this gonna take forever just to change one little letter in my forum name? One... two.. threeeeeeeee... four.......<br /><br />Is there demand for Watson gel fent patches atm?<br />Other possible wares.. SMALL quantities of straight outta the club cannabis. I have a 0.001 (milligram) scale, so no worries there. But I&#039;d prefer to work with club hash instead. Problem- Since it&#039;s club certified (and I hit the best clubs in my area), I get higher stupid prices on hash BUT there is an excellent branded fullmelt of all types always in stock (C02 process)

				FE = thugs<br /><br />It&#039;s a fact of life. When the market is flooded with vendors willing to tolerate new buyers WITHOUT FEing, and quality products are available WITHOUT FEing, then I stand by my judgment. The escrow system is the only legitimacy in an ANONYMOUS market. So without TRUST--in which I determine through reliable and consistent transactions via escrow--then FE = THUGS.<br /><br />Escrow. These drugs are anonymous, which means untested. How many people are testing their narcotics before consuming? No matter how good you say your product is, or your personal background, there are still professional standards that must be upheld. Until the system becomes public and legal, laboratory tested, then there is no protection beyond ESCROW.<br /><br />FE = THUGS

				Thanks for keeping this post alive. I believe our first 50 posts shouldn&#039;t be spam.<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t FE unless you are willing to LOSE $$.<br />2. Pontificate the fact that you are buying untested drugs--not evaluated by established laboratories!<br />3. Stay the fuck out of jail by getting smart, and being diligent with safe and sound decision making.<br />4. Improve SR through thorough and thoughtful feedback.<br />5. Don&#039;t SPAM the forums!<br />6. Use Liberte or Tails (LINUX), and get the FUCK AWAY FROM MICROSOFT, you MIB magnets.<br />7. Let&#039;s get high as a motherfucker, because it&#039;s Friday, bitches. And goddamn I want some cocaine!<br /><br />General Advice:<br /><br />Get a haircut.<br />Take a bath.<br />Mow your lawn.<br />Keep you car well maintained.<br />Don&#039;t do drugs in public!<br />Double check that you&#039;re not a fuck up.<br /><br />Law enforcement are often times ex-military special forces. The only way they won&#039;t catch you is if you abide by the same belief in discipline and order. Practice OCD and paranoia. It&#039;s fucking healthy if you don&#039;t wanna go to prison.<br /><br />I plan on being on the SR for as long as it is available. Eventually, I will become a seller. I hope to tackle every market, including public safety. I believe our drugs should be tested and certified. I don&#039;t like fake dope, and I believe we all deserve quality.
