				I&#039;ve always had an interest in methylone since MDMA was so god damn expensive, and since they are so structurally similar I anticipated that they would be basically the same thing.<br />Well, in some ways that was true, but methylone in the end gave me some of the nastiest fucking side effects that never happened on any drug before, even mdma including:<br />-bizarre tingling all over my body<br />-rapid heart rate/panic attacks<br />-purple knees<br />-horrible, horrible depression (way worse than MDMA) in the days after<br /><br />And this wasn&#039;t even a massive amount I consumed, I did a 140 mg starter dose with 3 40 mg boosters over the course of the night. People have recommended to me much, much larger doses.<br />Maybe I just have some incompatibility with it and you&#039;ll be fine, but please BE FUCKING CAREFUL WITH THIS STUFF.<br />I&#039;ve gone through an entire week of hell thanks to this drug.<br />I finally got the willpower to flush it today, and I feel so much happier and relaxed.<br /><br />TLDR; Methylone is NOT MDMA. It has almost no clinical research compared to MDMA, and may fuck you up awfully like it did to me.<br />If you want to do it, I&#039;m not forcing you not to, but please, please be careful. <br /><br />Please feel free to discuss/bump the thread to get this out in the open.<br />I don&#039;t want anyone to have to go through same living hell I did.<br />Also, feel free to ask me questions if you&#039;d like.<br />Thanks to whoever reads this for listening to my story<br />/rant<br />

				Also, if anybody could explain why a single beta-ketone can cause such nasty effects for me, it would be much appreciated.

				I can&#039;t speak from experience because I&#039;ve never tried this.&nbsp; But I was thinking of placing an order and now I think I&#039;ll just stick with the MDMA.&nbsp; That and the vendor I was going to order from is in China and I&#039;ve been reading about some CD&#039;s from China.&nbsp;

				Please just get MDMA. I&#039;ve done MDMA 10 times or so and never, NEVER felt this awful.<br />It&#039;s so tempting because of the price, but your physical health and well being is worth far, far more.

				bk-MDMA is less neurotoxic than MDMA.&nbsp; Alexander Shulgin felt that it was great for depression and should be used in the legitimate pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp; I have only done it a couple times but both times were doses higher than that and it was VERY similar to MDMA.&nbsp; &nbsp;bk-MDMA is speedier than MDMA.&nbsp; You can also safely take much higher doses but it is a waste to do so.<br /><br />Who did you order this methylone from?

				By the way, I&#039;ve done an obscene number of different drugs and RCs and have never felt even close to this &quot;damaged&quot; by any of them.<br />Thankfully I&#039;ve never touched MDPV, Mephedrone, or any other beta-ketone drug. Lord knows what those could have done to me.

				definitely speedier and very &quot;moorish&quot; but alot of people like that. <br />I like the dopey part of the roll. Jack is the authority on it for sure though.

However, the depression I felt after using was undoubtedly the result of the drug, and I also felt like it was quite cardiotoxic. I don&#039;t want to name the vendor because I don&#039;t want to make this a personal thing, but they are one of the top methylone vendors on the SR and have recieved mostly praise for their product.

				I love methylone! It&#039;s like MDMA without ANY adverse effects for me!<br /><br />I&#039;ve redosed all night on methylone before without feeling anything but a little tired on the comedown. MDMA gets me a shitty comedown after one medium dosage hit.

				There is amazingly pure pink methylone and amazingly pure clearish methylone.&nbsp; I carry both.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard bad things about the vendor that you PMed me by my customers but I&#039;ve read good things about them from their customers.&nbsp; That is kind of how SR is anyways.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably good methylone.&nbsp; It is pretty obvious that don&#039;t react well to the substance.
