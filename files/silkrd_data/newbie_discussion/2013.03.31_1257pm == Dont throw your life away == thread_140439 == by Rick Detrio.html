I will definitely hire some hookers and have a few benders!!! hahaaaaaa <br />Building a case. L O fuckin L.<br /><br />EDIT: He worked for the DEA for 14 years. Tell all of us how you are winning the war on drugs. Share with us how many cities have become drug-free zones since you have started working at the DEA? OR if the number is 0, how many cities have become drug-free since DEA was created? <br /><br />&nbsp;:o
