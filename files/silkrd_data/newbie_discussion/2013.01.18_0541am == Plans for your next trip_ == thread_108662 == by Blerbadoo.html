				Hey everyone, just wanted to hear what people have planned for their next trip.<br /><br />I have recently obtained some LSD from lucydrop and 2c-p from m0rpheu5 should be here any day. <br />Since a friend wants to do acid with me, I will be holding off on that. That trip is still up in the air. A friend, however, did a hit last night and said it was perfect for the clubbing environment we were in, not too overwhelming.<br /><br />With the 2c-p, I plan on taking a 6-8mg dose and working on learning the violin, going for a walk, and writing lyrics/poetry. I have heard the drug can be quite useful for creativity, so this should be a good test. Hopefully, I will have 50 posts by the time I trip so I can write a report for m0rpheu5.<br /><br />What about the rest of you?

				Sup blerbadoo<br /><br />I stumbled upon this thread and read my name, so I&#039;ll contribute :)<br /><br />My next trip will probably be a honey flip, or a basic 300ug LSD trip if I can score some. I&#039;d love to study me some astronomy while on Lucy, or go on a hike. Maybe some 2c-t-x later ?<br /><br />Also this whole 50 points thing is pretty weird, I can&#039;t even post on my own review thread or do product offers. Oh well.

				That would get pricy veiover. Once you account for tolerance, you would be taking more and more. Being sober would be your new high :P<br /><br />I am very interested in the use of psychedelics for studying. I have heard reports of people being able to learn the basics of a language very quickly while focusing on low doses of LSD. It makes sense as psychedelics appear to speed up the processes of the brain. Other derivatives of Ergot such as hydergine increase the flow of oxygen to the brain and also communication of the hemispheres(I believe).<br /><br /><br />Enjoy! and share trip reports!

				I had my first, smoked DMT trip last weekend.&nbsp; I had asked a girl friend to come take the pipe from me and be my safe guard as I had never done it.&nbsp; The intense visuals only lasted 5 minutes compared to the 10-20 often reported around the web.&nbsp; It was whimsically majestic, but was too short for me to gain anything.&nbsp; It was very mind-blowing and confusing.&nbsp; My company was also a bit of a down as she started asking me questions at about 3 minutes in when I opened my eyes to take a look around the room.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be blasting off again this weekend.&nbsp; I will be alone in my bed this time and plan to smoke more in a shorter period of time.<br /><br />After that, I&#039;ll be dosing on some home-grown mushrooms the weekend after (assuming I have no major uni projects due).&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tripped in about 6 months so I&#039;m very excited for this.&nbsp; I hope to spend the entire trip in silent darkness in my bed; I always have to pee a lot, though, and the trip to the bathroom will often distract me and lead me around my apartment.&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;m pretty excited.&nbsp; Gonna order some 25i-NBOME from Tyl3r Durden.&nbsp; When it gets here I&#039;m gonna do a test run to make sure it and I are compatible as I&#039;ve yet to sample it before and then I will do it at a Zakir Hussein show.&nbsp; Also thinking about MXE and a psychedelic of some kind at an STS9 show after that.&nbsp; Sometime in the relative future I&#039;m going to go for a &quot;dark trip&quot;.&nbsp; An eight of Shrooms and 750mg DPH.&nbsp; Should be pretty wild.&nbsp; Also I&#039;ve been dying to try a Bhudda flip; that is an opiate and a psy.&nbsp; Definitely on my to do list.&nbsp; Also I&#039;ve got some DiPT lying around that Imma IV and then whenever that Ketamine gets here do that.&nbsp; Man I love drugs.&nbsp; And the SR. :D

				Tesselated &amp; JerseyCow have the shit!&nbsp; Clean and reasonably priced.&nbsp; Potency has been an issue for me with Tesselated, but I&#039;d rather get a clean but weak tab and have a museum experience, than to feel sick as a dog and and freak out worry about wether I got slipped an RC.&nbsp; There was some discussion on the LSD Avengers thread regarding the differences between Canadian and EU acid.&nbsp; The general consensus is that the Canadian is mellow, minimal body load, but mild visuals,&nbsp; EU stuff on the other hand was rated as causing more physical discomfort, but also giving the user strong visuals. I really ain&#039;t buying it.&nbsp; If both substances are LSD, I would say that the users are getting a higher dose from the EU, plain and simple.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I ate 2 1/2 of Tesselated&#039;s WoW tabs and then smoked DMT 3 hours later.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say that I will ever do that again.&nbsp; DMT is just too dark for me, it accentuated the negative for the 15-30 minutes that it was active. DMT is sort of malevolently alien to me. On a positive note, I was awestruck by the intensity of the visuals.&nbsp; While walking by a table covered with bronze figurines and antique watches and an antique lamp, I could see each and every object in high detail simultaneously.&nbsp; I never imagined that so much visual information could be processed at once. I will probably sample JerseyCow&#039;s Gandalf blotter this weekend......Sans the DMT.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I just got the 150mic avatars from JCow. I tried one and it felt very clean, the visuals were slight slight slight. I had some shit from the street in november and it was horrably painful, bitter and numbed my mouth, but I had visuals for the first time in my life and it was hyraglif type shit. I&#039;d take a clean feeling and slight visuals over that any day for now on. That stuff probably wasnt even real L.
