				As a vendor, it would be nice to be able to comment on my thread that is currently residing in the product offers section. Was this considered when creating a newbie section? I don&#039;t want to have to make some 50 posts about nothing in here just to be able to update my existing threads elsewhere.

				I look forward to reading it Shadow. If you aren&#039;t above the 50 post limit when you have it ready, I&#039;m sure we can find some kind soul to cross post it :)<br /><br />And for the record, I am not upset about this new rule, I just hope they figure a way for even new vendors to still be able to maintain a thread for themselves in the main forum.

				I agree it&#039;s a bit strange to have posts in other sections already, then one day have to post only.in a newbie forum, but oh well. Time for us to buckle down and chew through it. Then I can play with the adults again... Good luck getting back into your thread! Must suck to get locked out of your vendor thread...

I posted a review thread when I first became a vendor and have pretty much just lurked in the forums since then. Today, I wanted to reply to a post and was confused as hell trying to figure out how to reply. I finally saw the Newbie section and figured out the new Newbie rules. What a pain in the ass but I can live with it if it keeps the spam under control.<br /><br />I requested access to the vendor forum. I wonder if I will be able to post there.
