				Tired this post elsewhere with no results so figured I would try it here.<br /><br /><br />I am currently taking 120mg of the new formula Oxyconton. These are the ones with OP on one side and 40 on the other.<br /><br />I cut some in half and take tiny, tiny bites of it and slowly chew and dissolve in my mouth. I know this is not the best way but it keeps me with a mild high that helps with the pain.<br /><br />No one wants to sell the new Oxyconton on SR due to nobody really wanting it. Which I understand.<br /><br />I just came into some of the crushible ones on SR and will be trying them. My question is will a smaller dose of the crushible ones give me the same effect as the method I use on the New formula?<br /><br />Thanks

				Hey NewGuy,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I used to be a big fan of the orig Purdue Pharma &quot;OC&quot; Oxy&#039;s.&nbsp; Back in around Aug of 2010, they all but disappeared for most and were replaced with the &quot;OP&quot; formulation that you are familiar with.&nbsp; The difference, as you already know is that the new formula is pretty impossible to crush up.&nbsp; The biggest difference for you is going to be how fast the &quot;crushables&quot; are going to release oxy into your system through the tissue in your mouth.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never personally taken anything but suboxone sublingually, but I do know that Ive known other H injectors that prefered to take OC 80&#039;s and 40s in this way instead of injecting them.&nbsp; When in doubt, take less- you can always take more later.&nbsp; If you take too much, you cant undo that and take less! Have fun, but be careful!

				<br />I have used the old OC&#039;s the new OP&#039;s and roxies. I must mention i do not have any pain as you do so i cannot comment on that.<br />The old formula OC&#039;s got me the highest out of all 3 and seems to hit you all at once and last longer than a roxy [when snorted.. i have never swallowed the old oxy&#039;s]. Roxy&#039;s seem to get you high really quick and then go away fast, depending on the brand. I am actually a fan of the OP&#039;s and i know people who have trouble getting rid of them in real life. I do the same thing you do i cut a op80 in half, i suck on the coating and bite it into smaller pieces.. believe it or not the coating is a few mg&#039;s of IR and alot of people waste it by scraping off the coating. Im actually getting a few of the old formula one&#039;s myself and seeing if they are what I remembered them to be, i remember getting high off 20 mg&#039;s of the original formula and I need atleast 40 mg&#039;s of the new formula.<br /><br />Im not sure if any of this is gonna help I kinda just rambled on. If I was you id get the original oxys

				Micro,<br /><br />Bumping means to bring or &quot;bump&quot; the post back to the top of the forum. This gives the OP a chance to have his post looked at by fresh eyes.<br /><br />Btw is this case &quot;OP&quot; means original poster.

				The old crush-able/snort able/chewable/shootable/pluggable....plug??? :o nahhh, if they&#039;re real and not some counterfeit/placebo , should feel much stronger than an OP.<br />OP40 and OC40 both got 40mg&#039;s of oxycodone, but , the OC&#039;s , if chewed, snorted etc, etc, any other method of ingestion except swallowing them the way your supposed to gives you all that oxy into your system at once rather than having the OP dole it out to you little by little over what ?.....12 hours?&nbsp; <br />
