They will have a DCN/Tracking number to confirm delivery. Never sign, ever.

				Real name versus fake name is debated, but in my opinion you should just use your real name because if you use a fake it could not be delivered. If LEO wants to do a controlled delivery (they come to your door and ask you to sign) you can just deny the package, but after that I wouldn&#039;t risk using the same address. If you&#039;re not, learn to use PGP to encrypt your name and address.

				quite frankly i think the home address is the safest place. where ur most comfortable, its where all ur mail comes normally N e way, u can watch things first hand and just deny signing for anything and take precautions when opening, wait a hour or two to open it to see if they bust ur door down lol. take a ride to see if they tail u with the package and if they pull u over say u were going to post office to return to sender because u werent expecting packages. just take a chill pill and do it. all else fails 1 simple rule. DENY DENY DENY DENY DENY DENYDENYDENYDENYDENYDENY.<br /><br /><br />DONT INCRIMINATE URSELF!

				PGP - *groan*. I know I should use it, but even going through step by step guides makes my head hurt ..<br /><br />I could use name of previous occupier as I still get mail addressed to them.<br /><br />TBH I&#039;d pretty surprised if the powers that be wasted resources on kicking the door in for the amounts I&#039;m interested in.

				For personal amounts the risk is small, but it is always better to err on the side caution especially when it quite easy. If you use Windows I recommend using an application called gpg4usb which is very simple to use. <br /><br />http://gpg4usb.cpunk.de/

				Read the vendor&#039;s page, make sure they don&#039;t require a sig.&nbsp; Typically domestic orders are fine, it&#039;s when you start doing international you might have to sign.<br /><br /><br />Real name vs. Previous tenant etc.<br />This is up to you... but remember, if you use someone else&#039;s name, the mailman may not deliver it.&nbsp; You would then not be able to pick up your shit from the post office since you&#039;re not that person.<br /><br />A person that is currently experiencing this dilemma:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=214025.0<br /><br /><br />PGP:&nbsp; Take the friggen 10 minutes and learn it... it&#039;s really not that complicated.&nbsp; The effort is worth the benefit. <br />(PGP for idiots)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=197274.msg1419609#msg1419609

The guy who lived at my house before I moved still regularly gets mail there, so I wasn&#039;t too concerned about it getting redirected to him (it&#039;s been like 5 years now and it&#039;s still going on).<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t sure whether morally it&#039;s the right thing to do, in fact I&#039;m still not, but if I figured if the cops ever did look into it 1) they&#039;d know straight away it was really intended for me, not him 2) the quantities are so low it&#039;s not worth bothering about and 3) as far as I can tell, if the post were intercepted, no crime has been committed by either of us as purchasing drugs isn&#039;t illegal, only actually possessing them is (under UK law). There&#039;s nothing that could be proven.<br /><br />I&#039;m happier taking this approach - and risking something being stopped at the post office and me not being able to pick it up as it&#039;s addressed to someone else - as the quantities involved are pretty small mostly. I&#039;d rather that than have the cops harassing me.

				I&#039;m using my real name and address and I know others that have done it with no problem. I feel more comfortable doing that than opening a PO box and having to pick my shit up at the post office, or sending shit to a neighbor&#039;s or friend&#039;s. I feel pretty safe cause I&#039;m only ordering very small amounts and not ordering internationally.<br /><br />I would definitely say it is worth it to take the time to learn PGP. Many say that it&#039;s stupid not to and some vendors even require it. I groaned and dragged my feet about it but particularly if you&#039;re shipping directly to your house you really want that extra security.

				I am having a hard time figuring out how to encrypt my address. Can someone explain that to me in a simple way? I just want to be sure I do everything properly and hae it down before I even think of making an order. Any help would be very much appreciated, as I am very new to this. Thanks.

				I ship to nearby hotels using a name on one of my Fake I.D&#039;s and no room number especially for high risk packages. they receive mail for guests all time, and if a room number isn&#039;t written on it they will just hold onto it until you come by. I show up at random, usually ungodly hours of the night after I have confirmed arrival via either vendor or telephoning the hotel (If I call to confirm I never show up right after, I let it sit until my paranoid side tells me to stop being a pussy). Done this plenty of times and have even had packages intercepted, a CD will be extremely hard at a hotel under these circumstances. <br /><br />But I&#039;ve also used my real name and address back in the day and nothing happened.
