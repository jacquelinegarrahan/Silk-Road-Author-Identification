				Hello members.<br /><br />I want to introduce myself my name is SRvendor i sell for year drugs and have HQuality products available.<br />My friend gave me a SR show and saw that there are vendors that are very popular. But one thing scares me now and these are the prices.<br />I understand that there are risks attached to it as losing your products but the prices are insane.<br />But it is impossible that amounts of 100 euros will be requested for cocaine.<br /><br />Because i have big batches straight from SA its possible to introduce my cocaine with sharp prices.<br /><br />Sure it feels as if I&#039;m talking blah.<br />I will promise all members my vendor account is open in 3 days.<br /><br />I&#039;ve everything available because I&#039;m not new as a drug seller. This is a new way to achieve big things.<br />My goal is to achieve a great name as a vendor that gives me more satisfaction than big profits.<br /><br />I am familiar with sending illegal products.<br />For years i shipped weed through the mail to regular customers Worldwide.<br /><br />I first conducted research on SR and have total more than 2 weeks of intensive reading on all the forums. And then I started this account name.<br />I will now explain everything how I want to work.<br /><br />SRvendor:<br />- Sending of high quality cocaine and MDMA, products are from the source.<br />- XTC pills can also be arranged.<br />- By post (normal flat envelopes.)<br />- Use of thick mylar bags for countries with high risks.<br />- Ship stealth.<br />- Ship safe.<br />- Good service and communication.<br /><br />Loyalty is a big thing for me. If there are some questions please ask them.<br />I want to connect with you all.<br /><br />SRvendor.<br /><br />
