				OK,&nbsp; I am very new to SR and have absolutely NO idea how this system works.&nbsp; Please can someone explain to me the BASICS of the BTC currency and how it works, how the currency comes to you, how you use the currency on SR once you have some BTC etc.&nbsp; Assume i know NOTHING.&nbsp; There are people in this forum offering to sell BTC directly, is this risky?&nbsp; Are there alot of scammers out there? <br />Also, what is the best way to buy BTC from England, I hear it is far easier in the USA, but could really use some help as I am gagging to buy some decent opiates even though they seem to be quite expensive compared to street value. Also, any English people around can tell me whether the product available on SR is superior to street product. For example :-&nbsp; Heroin.&nbsp; Is the stuff here purer than something i would be able to pick up for £50 a gram in London?&nbsp; I have seen some for around 9 BTC per gram.. around £86 at current rates.&nbsp; Please give me some advice.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.&nbsp; A Jakey Monkey.

Firstly, how to get coins.<br /><br />You should buy otc (over the counter). There is a freenode irc client which works in your browser. You will need to use gpg to authorise yourself on the network, and should only trafe with authorised members.<br /><br />You can find out all you need to know on the bitcoin otc wiki. You pay by bank transfer. The coins are released and the vendor shows you a link to blockchain - which verifies that the coins have been released. It may take time for coins to appear in your wallet, so this is how you know they have been sent. If you use the bitcoin wallet client to receive, be aware that it can take a VERY long time to get up to date. You should run the client and allow it to update (whcih can take days initially) in order that you do not end up waiting days to get your coins.<br /><br />Secondly, the H and C I have bought have been second to none. I know a chappie who buys from a C dealer in London - his supposed &#039;mate&#039; and the shit is less than 30 percent at my estimation. Horribly cut - and this is normal (5-10 percent purity is quite usual). The stuff I buy here is definitely as near as &#039;off the boat&#039; as I have ever had, and I have had a job unloading it off boats in the past.<br /><br />If you do have trouble working out BTC otc, pm me and I will walk you through it. I&#039;m thinking of selling BTC myself and may be doing so in the near future. Make sure you get the authorisation part right to ensure that the person you transfer money to is in fact the reliable vendor you think they are (there is a &#039;web of trust&#039; which records transactions and by which vendors of BTC build reputation).<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />AL

				By the way, Frank Matthews&#039; heroin is excellent. Yes it is much better than the street gear, and I live in a place where the street gear is very good.
