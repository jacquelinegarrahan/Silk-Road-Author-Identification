				As the title says - I&#039;m thinking of trying Psychedelics <br /><br />But I don&#039;t know where to start when I look at the listings I get quite overwhelmed with choice and what all the different products do.<br /><br />I wonder if there are people on here who can give me a simple guide to what the different items do.<br />Nothing to epic. Just personal experience and knowledge will do :)<br /><br />And I have read the forums and googled but I just didn&#039;t learn what I think I can from fellow individuals.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />WWW

				Can&#039;t go wrong with LSD in my opinion. Shrooms are fun as well. Wouldn&#039;t recommend DMT as your first psychedelic, although some friends who did it as their first one said they liked it because it was short lasting.<br /><br />Read about LSD though, I think you&#039;ll find it&#039;s a good one to start with.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd.shtml<br />(clearnet)

				Definitely LSD. It was the first psychedelic I took and it set me on a path in my life that has been full of wonder and amazingness as I explore the infinite possibilities that phsycedelics offer :D And I&#039;ve managed to stay sane, get a degree, a &#039;proper&#039; job and all that normal shit. I truly believe my psychedelic adventures have made me a much more intelligent and open-minded person. So go for it!<br /><br />Since trying LSD when I was 16 I&#039;ve moved on to other stuff. I love shrooms, mostly because I pick them myself and I just love that feeling of tripping on something that I picked out of the ground myself. If I were you I&#039;d steer clear of the nbome, DMT, 2c families etc for now. At the end of the day they are all just variations on what you get from LSD and they are all very new and haven&#039;t been tested thoroughly. There&#039;s a reason LSD has been so popular for so long...it works and there&#039;s plenty of info out there about it. Stick with the original and the best.&nbsp; <br /><br />But the most important thing to learn about any psychedelic experience is set and setting and getting yourself in the right headspace. So if you haven&#039;t done the work and researched how to get the most of out a psychedelic experience, you should really do that before worrying about what drug to take. <br /><br />Happy to offer more advice if you want :)

				Yep, stick with those who have been around for years because they&#039;ve been proven not too harsh on your system, like LSD and mushrooms. I&#039;d recommend to start with mushrooms between these two, because they&#039;re milder imo.<br />When you feel like you&#039;re experimented enough with these, try smoking some DMT :).<br /><br />I&#039;m just starting with phenethylamines, but so far they seem fun (2C-B is great! i will try 2C-I and 2C-E soon).. except NBOME which is just too nasty imo (nausea, frying brain, etc.)<br /><br />And just like Alchemetric states: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=167898.msg1197450#msg1197450">Quote from: alchemetric on June 04, 2013, 05:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But the most important thing to learn about any psychedelic experience is set and setting and getting yourself in the right headspace.

				Thanks for your advice everyone!<br /><br />I agree I certainly have more reading to do and will be starting with a well established substance :)<br /><br />CHEERS<br /><br />WWW<br /><br />

				Like others have said, definitely start with LSD or mushrooms.&nbsp; LSD is the best in my opinion because it&#039;s the most consistent, but mushrooms would be a good choice if you want to start with a shorter trip.&nbsp; Erowid and Wikipedia have tons of helpful info.

				If you do shrooms your first time I suggest a dose of 2g-2.5g of cubensis. I had an 1/8th my first time and it got a little overwhelming after a bit. Good luck!

DMT &quot;hasn&#039;t been tested thoroughly&quot;? Of what the hell are you babbling about? Nbome and RCs have NOTHING to do with DMT.<br />DMT is a substance we know everything about and it is one of the absolutely less toxic, yes, even less than LSD and that says it all.<br /><br />Btw, NO, DMT has NOTHING to do with other psychedelics (at last in the over threshold dosages), it is NOT a variation of LSD in effect, neither remotely so. That maybe it&#039;s not so indicated for a first use (but also this is debatable) can be correct, but the rest is a bunch of idiocies.<br /><br />People, please, if you don&#039;t know of what you are talking about, don&#039;t give bullshit information to others.

				My first psychedelic was shrooms in amsterdam it was to powerful man ! i think the 110 LSD is best for beginners .. take half wait like 3-4 hours and if you see that you can handle more take the rest . and have a good time!

				mushrooms are the way to go with a first trip. your surroundings are very important when tripping no matter what you use make sure your around good people you trust with your life, if you are by yourself remember you are tripping and dont take your ideas to far, when you realize life is a triangle and not a circle you will be fine
