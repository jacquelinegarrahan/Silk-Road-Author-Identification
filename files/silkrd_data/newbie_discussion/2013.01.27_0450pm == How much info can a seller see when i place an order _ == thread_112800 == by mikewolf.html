				Not really, i have this ideea in my head that if a seller would want to incriminate you he could use your previous purchases to do so. Paranoid and highly unlikely, i know, but had to ask.

				The vendor gets the same information as the buyers give<br />Shipping address/delivery method (hopefully pgp&#039;d)<br />What was ordered<br />Auto-Finalize rate/stats (to make sure you wish to do business)<br /><br />That&#039;s about it.<br />Only really what is needed.<br /><br />

				So wait, can a vendor see *what* my former transactions are? Or just that they are there? <br /><br />Like will it say history: 5 transactions <br /><br />or<br /><br />History: 5 transactions<br /><br />E-Book<br />E-Book<br />E-Book<br />Molly <br /><br />etc?

				They can&#039;t see the detailed version of your past transactions. Just a number.

Maybe all they really just need to see is that you have spent more than a trivial amount of bitcoin with relatively few purchases .

				Yes they can see how much you have spent, so if the amount is too small for the number of transactions they ll know you bought &quot;digital goods&quot; or something.

				Click on &#039;Account&#039; on your SR home page.&nbsp; Then click on &#039;Purchasing stats&#039;.&nbsp; That&#039;s the information the vendor will see in addition to what you enter in the address box.
