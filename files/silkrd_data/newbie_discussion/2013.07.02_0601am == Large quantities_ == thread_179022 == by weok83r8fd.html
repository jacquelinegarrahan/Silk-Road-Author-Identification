				Hello - <br /><br />I am new but this is not a troll post.&nbsp; I am wondering if there are ways or if its actually ever done that large transactions are ever facilitated through this site such as 1-10kg or if it just tends to be more sales for people&#039;s personal use.<br /><br />Also in order to sell quantities like that I presume you must offer lots of small free samples and sell smaller quantities first?<br /><br />Thanks

				I believe there are quite a few people who use the road to move bulk amounts. I think the most important thing is to do the proper research about any vendor you want to order from, and develop a rapport with the ones that you can determine to be legit. Buy small amounts or samples to test, and to help make judgement about the overall quality of the vendor before putting a lot of money at stake. There&#039;s also a certain amount of concern you might want to give to your receiving address if you want to place bulk orders on a regular basis. <br /><br />It seems that a large amount of the community on SR is there for personal use and such, so to answer your question, the road caters to both. <br /><br />Also as it seems it can&#039;t be said enough, never finalize early.

				Yes there are quantities sold in that weight range.&nbsp; One of the first five orders I received on my Jack N Hoff vendor account was a kilogram of bk-MDMA.&nbsp; Many users order multiple pounds of cannabis from vendors.&nbsp; Just look around.

				If you&#039;re talking about selling coke then yes this is a great place.&nbsp; Very high prices you can turn a very high profit! :)
