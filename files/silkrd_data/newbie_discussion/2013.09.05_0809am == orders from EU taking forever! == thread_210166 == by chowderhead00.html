				I&#039;ve got 3 orders that were shipped just over 2 weeks ago (all different vendors).&nbsp; None of arrived yet.&nbsp; From what I understand its the beginning of holiday season over there so that might have something to do with it.&nbsp; Anyone else experiencing this at the moment?

				Reading from other posts in the shipping forums, there is talk about this same topic. But i think the general consensus is that there is just a delay with packages from that general area taking a bit longer than normal at the moment. I certainly hope that&#039;s the case anyways, cos i gots 2 packages im waiting for, and very much looking forward to.<br /><br />Fingers crossed!

				^ Did any of your orders arrive?&nbsp; Because mine didn&#039;t :(.&nbsp; Fwiw, I ordered from Frank Matthews, Crystal Meth Cat and Haizenberg.&nbsp; It&#039;s been over a month now.&nbsp; Frank Matthews I know is MIA at the moment, so there&#039;s a good chance that order wasn&#039;t sent.

				It depends on the country they are shipping from. No delays from Germany, France, UK, or Spain for that matter.
