				a vendor has normally a public private key posted on SR you import that key and use that to encrypt message so only the vendor can decrypt that message<br />when messaging a vendor you also post your private key so he can reply with a message&nbsp; thats encrypted with your private key so only you can decrypt it

				Ok, just learning pgp, and this is what i understand so far. <br />Have not tried this yet, so any corrections are appreciated.<br /><br />-download a pgp program <br />-generate your personal key (file &gt; new key)<br />-copy recipients public key to clipboard and save to keyring<br />-open clipboard and write your message <br />-click encrypt button and choose which recipient key to use<br />-the message is encrypted using their key<br />-send the encrypted message, with your personal key, in an email or PM<br />-receive an encrypted message, and copy/paste into clipboard, click decrypt<br /><br />I still don&#039;t know what the &#039;sign&#039; and &#039;verify&#039; buttons do.

				I&#039;m still having trouble with PGP as well. Most people have trouble with Tor, SR, and Bitcoins, but all that was easy compared to this. It&#039;s just gonna take a little reading, and I think tonight I will do just that.

				thank you for your help, I think I got it figured out for the most part.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\<br /><br /><br />Except this part...<br /><br />What is the difference between a public and private key?&nbsp; If I copy and paste my key online doesn&#039;t that mean other people could use it to read all the messages I encrypt with it?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				PGP was so obnoxious to learn. I took me a while to figure it out. I was using kleopatra and i finally decided to uninstall it and give GPA a shot. well, for some reason I figured GPA out within 15 minutes. I was pretty irate since i spent at least 5 hours tinkering with kleopatra ontop of countless guides I&#039;ve read and watched.

				Here&#039;s a piece of trivia about digital signatures and how they work which isn&#039;t that important but I think is interesting:<br /><br />There&#039;s no real difference between a public key and a private key, they are just two different extremely large prime numbers.<br /><br />The &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; things are just a convention, they can work both ways around. If the software allowed it then you could share your private key and keep your public key secret, people could use your private key to send you a message which is readable only by the person who has your public key!<br /><br />This is how &quot;digital signatures&quot; work. Instead of encrypting a message with the recipient&#039;s public key to send them a secret message, you instead encrypt it with your own private key to send a public message. If people can decrypt this with your public key then they know it was you who sent it. If the thing being encrypted is a fingerprint (cryptographic hash) of some other message then the encrypted fingerprint is a &quot;digital signature&quot; which proves that you sent the message and that it has not been tampered with; it&#039;s the modern equivalent of using a signet ring.
