				Long story short, the server was down earlier and I was desperate to finalise an order so it would arrive by tmoz.&nbsp; In the end, I tried a different link and it worked fine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I was so rushed that I didn&#039;t pay attention to the fact it was a .to link, or an onion.to gateway, which according to them isn&#039;t anonymous.&nbsp; Obviously, I&#039;m a dumbass for letting my desire for quick drugs overcome my need for security, but what&#039;s done is done now and it&#039;s a lesson for the future.&nbsp; My question is, if someone (i.e. LE) was watching the gateway and grabbed my IP, what&#039;s the chances they&#039;ll trace it back?&nbsp; Bear in mind my proxy was on so if they have an IP it&#039;ll be my proxies.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d be more worried about getting your SR pw and bitcoins stolen (if you entered your info elsewhere, im not sure if it could have been intercepted either...)....i&#039;d change all that asap.<br /><br />Your anonymity may have been compromised too, but unless you made an order on that fake site, the worst you might have is your info stolen

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. IF some LEO are watching the Road, they&#039;re gonna use their limited resources to try to make the big busts, like bringing down the Road somehow, or getting DPR on some kind of Rico stuff. They&#039;re not dedicating time/money/manpower on a buyer making a small buy. A while back I used that same gateway for about a month or more . I&#039;m not super computer literate and didn&#039;t even realize at the time what I was doing different. Your alright, just make sure it&#039;s a one time goof up.

				I&#039;m confused. Did you use Tor Browser Bundle to access silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to and order something? If so you should change your password and PIN immediately but you probably won&#039;t get caught. If you accessed silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to from a regular browser your ISP can see what you did and you better hope you slip through the cracks.

				Okay I&#039;ve changed my login details so that&#039;s taken care of.&nbsp; To answer the above question I was using tor browser, and had my proxy up, so my ISP shouldn&#039;t know shit. Also I was only finalising an order, not making one. I made that yesterday on the normal gateway.&nbsp; As far as I know the site was the legit silk road, it was just the gateway that was slightly sketchy.&nbsp;
