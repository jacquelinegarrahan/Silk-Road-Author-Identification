				Okay, so I managed to encrypt my address and I found my public key, what now? Where do I send both encryptions to? On the message where the vendor has his/her ad up? I&#039;m confused as to how to send my public key encryption and my encrypted message... lol.

				Oh, don&#039;t worry I did&nbsp; ;D I&#039;ve been doing my research for a couple weeks before I got to buy my first bitcoins (which were given to me today!), so I basically read a shit ton&nbsp; my DOC&#039;s list of vendors and their profile and rating, etc, etc and found the person I want to send it to. I just need to know how to send both my public key and encrypted message. I was looking on forums and youtube and it confused me. <br /><br />Are you supposed to put one encryption on top of the other in the vendors message box where the ad is? (since it says begins here and ends here, it separates them) or am I supposed to decrypt my public key and send that, idk anymore&nbsp; :o

				In GPA:<br /><br />-Select &quot;Clipboard&quot;<br />-Write your message in that clipboard<br />-Move clipboard aside and copy your key from the Keymanager/Keyring.&nbsp; <br />-Go back to the clipboad and post your public key below your message/address<br />-Select &quot;Encrypt&quot; from the menu bar... be sure to select that vendor, not yourself.&nbsp; (When you call someone on the phone you dial them, not yourself... but they need your number to call you back, right?)<br />- copy and past that entire mess on clipboard<br /><br />When you order, a box will ask you for your address... paste all that in there

				You don&#039;t need to give out your own key to send your address, or any message to someone; the other person only needs that if they need to message you. All you need to use is the vendor&#039;s public key: encrypt your message using it in the way Yoda explains (which it sounds like you&#039;ve already done) and paste the block of text it turns into, into the address box. Everything including -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- and -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
