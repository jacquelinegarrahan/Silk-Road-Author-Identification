				years ago i might someone who owned a pair of toads that produced a DMT like substance in there venom. you could milk the toad essentially just like snakes are milked for there venom except it looked like it came out of the side of its head lol the stuff looks gross. once dried you can smoke it. i did it twice and didn&#039;t like. its very intense and i didn&#039;t find the feeling appealing at all. i&#039;m not sure if this is the same chemical which is sold on the street and SR as DMT. luckily its duration is very short. i remember it being like 30mins except when its happening it feels like 30 hours lol
