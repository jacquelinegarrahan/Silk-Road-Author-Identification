				I&#039;ve looked around in the wiki and a little in the forum and couldn&#039;t find enough information about how to safely accept a package. Is there some sort of guide for beginners about tips and precautions regarding that manner? thanks.<br />

				No<br /><br />There isn&#039;t even consensus.&nbsp; Recent threads have several (unresolved) debates about which practices are helpful or harmful.&nbsp; Some SR vendors even have requirements that differ from one another.&nbsp; For example, some vendors refuse to use any shipping method that requires a receipt signature and some will not ship without requiring a receipt signature.&nbsp; Some vendors require to ship to your real address and others encourage you to set up something with a false name.

				The information is really dispersed all over these forums and the main site. Use your common sense and you should be all right. Once upon a time there was a catch-22 situation where you weren&#039;t allowed to finalize early but vendors wouldn&#039;t sell to you (a noob) if you didn&#039;t finalize early. Today this seems to have been resolved and many vendors will still sell to a noob without forcing him to finalize early. That said, if you pop up with no transaction history and try to buy $10000 worth of merchandise in one go, they&#039;re not going to have it.

				Try to find a vendor that does not require a signature on receipt. Most of them wont. Also research their level of stealth which you can find on their review threads on the forums and also their SR review pages. Avoid the ones with complaints of sloppy packaging or less-than-desirable stealth methods. <br /><br />I read the following advice earlier today: when you receive a package, write Return to Sender on top and leave it near your front door for a few days. If all is well on the 3rd day, go ahead and open it. Store it in a place that is not the address it was mailed to.
