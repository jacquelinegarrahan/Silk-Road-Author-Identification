				Just a heads up...in three weeks I&#039;ll be closing down for my little Summer vacation :)<br /><br />So if you want to guarantee delivery of some fine cola from my new stock, then pop to the shop and place your order!<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to miss anyone out who needs product for the wonderful Summer so consider ordering plenty to see you through my couple of weeks off....you know it makes sense!! :)<br /><br />A few of today&#039;s feedbacks for you to whet your appetite...<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice clean coke! Quick delivery! Great stealth! On weight! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy oh boy!! I so hope your here to stay. Fast shipping, great packaging and ripper gear. 5/5 all the way. Thanks<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great transaction. Stealth was very good, got to me in the US no problem. I must mention quality -- this is the real deal. There&#039;s a lot of cocaine in this cocaine -- no BS, totally worth the price. I&#039;ve been scammed before and this is not a scam. No speediness, no unpleasant effects from cutting, just euphoria. Of course there&#039;s a come down because there always is, that&#039;s the drug. As far as this vendor, for priority shipping, there was barely any wait at all considering the distance. Highly recommended, will purchase again. <br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next day delivery, great stealth, prompt communication, bang on weight and great product.<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very friendly in messages and helped me get order next day so thanks doc! Remember to hot plate and chop in this heat and enjoy! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven&#039;t opened yet but sure it is great as always<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely stuff as expected and perfect weight.<br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first order with this vendor and will certainly be using again. Great communication, quick to reply to messages and very helpful. Packaging is super stealth, best I have seen on SR. The gear was bang on weight and is absolutely amazing. Thanks DrCol. Will be ordering more soon<br /><br />So come on over for the most excellent service and fantastic cola all the way....&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Doc<br />
