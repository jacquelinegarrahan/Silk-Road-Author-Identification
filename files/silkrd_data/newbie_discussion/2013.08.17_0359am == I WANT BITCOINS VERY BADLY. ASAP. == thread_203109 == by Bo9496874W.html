				I&#039;ve been following this site for months now, been looking at purchasing from it for quite a while. But I have no bitcoins. Been trying localbitcoins, but no one in my area has the credentials trustworthy enough for me to meet up to make an exchange. Lol I am frustrated as fuck. If there is anyone out there selling bitcoins in a safe and secure way then I will be more than happy to make an exchange ASAP.

				If you&#039;re just looking to buy, especially small amounts, you can just use a normal bitcoin service like Coinbase or Dwolla/CampBX. SR tumbles the BTC when you make a deposit. You can also use something like Bitcoin Fog to do the same.

I mean I&#039;ve never made a purchase on Silk Road, at this point does it matter what method I use? Would using a credit card be very risky? It would be a rather small amount, but I am not 100% familiar with it all, so I will make sure I&#039;m very secure before I do anything. Sorry if I sound like a paranoid fuck.. lol

				Something about the buyer transfers the money , it shows up in your account then you send the coin and go back and the deposit is gone.

Just got a chargeback for almost $800 from an established seller with feedback. Trying to work on both ends to find out if we can track down the buyer.<br />&nbsp; <br />Just know: the payment can appear legit and cleared on Dwolla&#039;s end.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;buyer was a first time buyer, so i‘ve added some precautions for first timers.<br /><br />there’s really no way to protect against this scheme because it comes from a legitimate account with funds in it, so i‘m not sure if I should publicize it. Just know that if it happens to you, you’re out of the money for good.<br /><br />According to dwolla they will not handle disputes that involve ‘virtual currency’. I started requiring that buyers place the locbtc transaction number in the details box when sending money for their coins. In that manner you can show the transaction was for coins.<br />&nbsp; <br />Don&#039;t use Dwolla. They are hostile to P2P Bitcoin trading.<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />This is off the Localbitcoins.com forum <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3Reply...<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />o<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />+8104
