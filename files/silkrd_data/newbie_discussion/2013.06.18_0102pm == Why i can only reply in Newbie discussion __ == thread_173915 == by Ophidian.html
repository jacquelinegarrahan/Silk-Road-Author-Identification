				There are topics in the newbie section called &quot;spam to 50&quot; etc. You can use those topics to spam so that you have 50 posts. Then you can post in all sections. I just did that. :)<br /><br />..I don&#039;t know what&#039;s the point to this though.

				Maybe to keep all this small stuff out of the important discussions. I imagine a lot of users sign up with SR only to post a few times then never post again. They either lost interest or lost their password. It could also be a way to weed out the people who are actually serious.

				You could also just start a newbie review thread for the vendor in question... <br />That is what i would do...

				LOL I didn&#039;t figure that out &#039;till just a few days ago.&nbsp; I had just always skipped over the newbie section and just read and read all the other threads never really needing to ask or answer cause everyone else was doing it for me.&nbsp;

				I&#039;s to bad that I will be able only to write posts after 50 .<br />I&#039;m on Silroad for about 2 years I did buy a lot of stuff and would like to write a review for an excellent seller.<br />This Forum is very interesting so I will have fun anyway
