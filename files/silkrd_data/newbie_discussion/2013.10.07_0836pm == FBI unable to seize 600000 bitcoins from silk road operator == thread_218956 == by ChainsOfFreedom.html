				While authorities have control of Ulbricht’s wallet, that’s not the same as having the funds. It’s akin to seizing a computer from a suspect with valuable data inside, but being unable to access it because strong encryption was used to prevent access. Ulbricht himself surely has the necessary information to unlock his wallet — otherwise there would be little use in accumulating $80 million worth of Bitcoins. It’s possible prosecutors will use the leverage they have on him to work out a deal that includes turning over the encryption keys.<br /><br />The government doesn’t even want to recognize Bitcoins as money, but that apparently won’t stop it from spending them. In these dark days of government shutdowns and sequestration, Uncle Sam could use the infusion of cash. The Bitcoins taken as part of the Silk Road operation will be held until legal proceedings have finished, then they will be liquidated, according to an FBI spokesperson. Users who are out those 26,000BTC are unlikely to be seeing them again. Even if Ulbricht avoids spending the remainder of his days in prison, his $80 million fortune probably won’t be waiting for him.<br /><br />

Do you have ANYTHING to back that up?<br /><br />He is a fucking PIRATE! Ofcourse he have hidden the treasure!!!<br /><br />I think it&#039;s IMPOSSIBLE to be captain of the ship called Silk Road and not at least store one Brainwallet (clearnethttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet). He also probably hid his treasure in many different ways (treasure maps!) smarter than the way he hid himself. Pirates does not often take very good care of themselves but they DO LOVE TREASURE!<br /><br />Lets see if he will maybe let some treasure map slip out of prison and get a support DPR treasure hunt on! :D<br />

				You mean you hope DPR never use the coins??? That they are freezed in his account forever? Or did you mean to say you hope people like FBI never finds his treasure map and steals them?<br />I hope DPR digs up his treasure and shows the world how shiny it is some day :)
