				Hi i have tried both and i would say they are both great but if you want the holy grail of C then bungee54&#039;s your man.<br />I recently bought some of bungee54&#039;s and its great. I have only tested with 4&nbsp; small 35/30mg bumps and the euphoria is very nice with a peak of 10 mins and a nice relaxing mellow high to follow for 20mins. This stuff is not edgy but at these small doses you will need to do more then if doing 50mg/60mg i guess.<br />The color is off white/ creamy not yellow and very fluffy which a good sign.It hardly smells just a little coca alkaloid smell and slightly bitter but not over powering. Its texture is fluffy/dry but i have read that when left out it absorbs moisture which is a good thing. The comedown was so subtle so much so that i had a nap half an hour afterwards for an hour which is a very good sign ( No nasty stuff keeping you awake)<br /><br />Lloydsbrothers C is great too but does not have the high% compared to Bungee54&#039;s. Its very clean slightly off white/yellow tinge which could be a acetone wash?<br />Good Cocaine smell like as above but more stronger from what i remember( not a good thing as pure coke does not smell) .<br />Nice mellow high and comedown like above but just does not have that intense but mellow euphoria like Bungee54&#039;s C does.<br />Its more expensive than Bungees54&#039;s C and probs the best domestically or on par with drcol which has some nice product.<br />I guess with bungee54&#039;s its about risk if not domestic though his delivery rate is great.<br />I was reading he has only lost 4 items which is great plus a bunch of lost/stolen ones but dont know how many.<br />So the choice is yours my friend :)<br />All in all its a slight risk going with Bungee54&#039;s if non domestic but well worth it for the holy grail of snarf!............Enjoy!<br /><br /><br />

				You should go with bungee54 as his cocaine has been tested to be almost pure, has been getting rave reviews and has only reported that in over a year only about 4 packages got lost. And lyods gets mixed reviews so the obvious choice is bungee54.

				asgyhuli@ sounds like a freebie scrounger but I could well be wrong.<br />To answer your question, read the following link:<br /><br />&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0<br /><br />I think you will find bungee54 has the purest, but last time I looked he had no listings for coke up. Hope this helps.

				I dont like to double post but just updating on my first review on Bungees and lloydsbrothers C.<br />Thought i would try a 50mg line to see the overall effects compared to the 25mg bumps i did before and was happy with the effects.<br />The peak was about 15mins with a nice mellow euphoria for about 25mins which slops of nicely with no urge to dose again but i did anyway and had another 50mg line which was pleasant. I find the first line is always the best with the following lines chasing the first high.<br />Overall its great stuff with very little comedown in small sessions&nbsp; up to 500mg.<br />Keep up the good work Bungee54!!

				No problems drcol i have tried your product and it is very clean as im sure you are aware of.<br />In terms of the great euphoria and minimal comedowns when using high quality C its worth the extra money not to feel edgy..... just pure bliss!

				If you use a acetone wash it will get rid of all the acetone soluble cuts and leave just cocaine. Sadly the acetone wash will not get rid of&nbsp; amphetamines etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You will need to do further washes to get rid of&nbsp; &#039;active&#039;. You could buy the EZtest and test for&nbsp; these other cuts before hand to save further washes as lejunks instructions explain on the net.<br />As for is it good to wash Cocaine with acetone?.... i would say yes, just let it dry out fully.If you ever tried thexchanges Cocaine which im pretty sure was acetone washed,&nbsp; it had a funny smell but was as potent as hell.<br /><br />Enjoy GB :o

				These kinds of threads are great for finding sources.<br /><br />Personally, I never pay over $90/gram for blow. I would only make an exception if I knew I could step on that bitch once or twice for the turnaround.<br /><br />Speaking of which, anyone know of high purity, bulk listings up right now? Not 40% party blow, either. Something I could give a whack with lidocaine and vial/bag for the locals.<br /><br />
