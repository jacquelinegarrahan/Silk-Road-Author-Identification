				Just wondering if anyone has had to do this before or know of someone on SR who could help.<br /><br />We&#039;re off to the Dam in the next month or so and are renting a flat for a few days - about 12 of us. We want to arrange to have some goods on arrival (maybe coke and pills). <br /><br />Anyone know how to facilitate this?

				Soooo many good local vendors on SR for the Netherlands. So you could just tell the person renting out the apartment, that you need to receive some package (make up some story) and then order a day before you arrive.<br /><br />Otherwise the city is also full of drugs, but no idea how to get quality.

				Yep .. had thought of just getting delivered to the flat. I assumed that they would have a locked post box at the front entrance so would need to notify the owner.<br /><br />Going to look into mailboxes as well and have messaged a couple of Netherlands SR sellers to see if they can offer any advice.<br /><br />Thanks for you reply. ;-)<br />

				I was playing with these ideas, not sure how feasible they are or if vendors would go along with it but:<br /><br />- Ask the vendor to put the package in a locker in one of the major train stations. These lockers use a PIN code. The vendor leaves the package, sends you a message with the location of the locker and the pin code, and you pick it up and finalize. The problem is that this implies a risk for the vendor, as you could be LE. But if your buyer history is good and since he can choose time and place and there is no way LE is going to watch all lockers in the major train stations 24-7, maybe he will accept the risk.<br /><br />- Use the lost-and-found service of the dutch railways. According to their website, lost-and-found objects will remain for 5 days at the railway station where they were handed in. There you can pick it up without any fee. (After that they will take it to a central depot, and the procedure becomes a bit more difficult). So, the vendor hands over a bag at one of the railway stations in Amsterdam (he can just buy a very cheap bag somewhere) with some random stuff in it, including your stealthy package). A couple of days later, you go there and ask for it (you will have to give an accurate description of the bag and it&#039;s contents). Just don&#039;t say: &quot;it&#039;s the bag that contains coke&quot; ;-)<br /><br />I guess it all depends on how worthwhile this is for the vendor. Offer him a reasonable price for the effort.

				Order them off SR, timing it so they arrive the day after you do. First night there, have a smoke :)

				Great ideas everyone!!!<br /><br />Suppose my only other options are to hit a club on the first night or find an &#039;honest&#039; looking street vendor. The chances of the latter are unlikely though!

				Do not buy from a street vendor in Amsterdam, it&#039;s throwing away your money and potentially dangerous. You will have much better chances is a club, especially for MDMA, coke may be more difficult.<br /><br />But since you are 12 people, it would really be best if you can work something out with a vendor. Please do update this thread if in the end you do!<br /><br /><br /><br />
