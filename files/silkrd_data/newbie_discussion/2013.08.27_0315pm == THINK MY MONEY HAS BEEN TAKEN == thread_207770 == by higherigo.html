				CHILLLLL WINSTONNNNNNNNN<br /><br />Unlucky first experience man, its not always like this around here though :)<br /><br />Your coins are being tumbled as they should be, the problem seems to be back log after the new site update took place. SR are working on it as we speak, some people are already seeing coins arrive! Nothings been hacked or stolen as far as I can see, if that was the case we would no by now!!! SR take security seriously, and updates are always fresh, the recent TOR MAIL issues a good example of that!<br /><br />I know its tough, first time as well your thinking SHITTTTTTT....<br /><br />Its not what you want to hear, but submit a support ticket on the main site (bottom right corner) to add your name to the list, and enjoy your evening, im sure by the morning all will be well :)<br /><br />I also have a number of coins in limbo, I have no reason to panic though :)

				In agreement with Sinister.<br /><br />These things DO happen and they DO sort themselves out. It&#039;s just a shame it happened on your first time.<br /><br />If you sent to the correct address, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.

				My first purchase of bitcoins, I used blockchains pingit service, after I sent it, a message appeared to say - DO NOT USE PINGIT OUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN TAKEN. I of course panicked, posted on here, messaged Block chain, after 8 hours of driving myself crazy with no response, I went to bed angry and sure all this was a scam.<br /><br />I woke up with a message from Block chain saying they would honor my coin, and I did indeed get my coin!!. I made my first order and it never showed. The vendor messed me around but eventually came good.<br /><br />Sadly that was my first experience, happy to say its never been that bad since. I can honestly say I have never lost a BTC or an order on SR yet!!!!]<br /><br /><br />1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all time<br />total transactions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£506.68 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£785.92 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£1,075.60 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£1,075.60<br />total vendors &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />
