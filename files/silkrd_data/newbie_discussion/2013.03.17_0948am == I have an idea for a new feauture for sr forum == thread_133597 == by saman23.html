				i know this isn&#039;t&nbsp; the correct place to post this thread but really cbf with the 50+ spamming.<br /><br />I was wondering what everyone thinks about a verified marketplace for SR Forum?<br /><br />Just a place for small time venders looking to get rid of some stuff they have in their hands.<br /><br />i think its a great idea if they set up a special pass (maybe 5 bitcoins or by recommendation of others) to be able to post and sell their products now and then.<br /><br />Pleas let me know what everyone thinks about this.

There are other drug websites out there that don&#039;t charge fees. Go and find them. Your chances of being ripped off is incredibly high because of that, though.
