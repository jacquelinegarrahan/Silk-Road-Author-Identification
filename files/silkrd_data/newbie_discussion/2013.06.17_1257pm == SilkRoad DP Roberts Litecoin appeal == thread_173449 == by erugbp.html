				Apparently they can be used to maximize anonymity by &quot;washing your money with litecoins&quot; which makes it impossible to trace. <br /><br />More info on litecoins - http://litecoin.org/<br /><br /><br />

				The only problem I have with accepting LTC is the issue of having to constantly convert between BTC and LTC. On Atlantis for example, some vendors only accept LTC some only accept BTC, it can be confusing and inconvenient for such a straightforward process.

				I&#039;m unsure, LTC coin sounds great and is cheap to buy (exchange rate) and mine, faster transactions and confirms I do believe maybe a few other plus points.<br /><br />If anybody knows of any UK services that sell LTC, I may be slightly interested, I mean a legit internet service ran like MTGox or the likes of not just the guy who pm&#039;s in the next 10mins offering LTC for cash). <br /><br />I would like to see LTC in the future on SR, not sure if we need it yet but there maybe another successor just around the corner, or the enemy may succeed in stamping out out flames..... Doubt it like! <br /><br />I&#039;m broke as a joke very little BTC,LTC,GBP,EUR but I do have a Turkish coin that looks very similar to a 2 pound coin so I&#039;m looking for a partial sighted shop keeper to pass it off as a Â£2 I can buy my tea tonight lol....... I&#039;m joking about the shop keeper thing I wouldn&#039;t dare, not within my nature, but I do have the Turkish coin! <br /><br />Are there any services out there that do say Bank Faster Payments to a LTC wallet, I would be interested in buying some at some point in the future, hopefully they won&#039;t skyrocket. Earn LTC and save it. Buy BTC and lets get high :)<br /><br />I may look at mining a few LTC. I had a go at BTC earlier this year, but there was no chance I could earn anything, I have some BTC in a pool i&#039;m with&nbsp; and I&#039;m massively shy of the 0.5 threshold for payout, so they are just sat there. I wonder if I emailed them and asked if they would release the coins as there is no way I can reach the payout threshold...... Then maybe I can find someone of or somewhere that might sell me a packet of noodles for my tea and sometime in the future when the postman delivers I can have some tea!! But I&#039;m not going to FE for them ;)&nbsp; I&#039; not that broke really I can eat, clothe myself, I have shelter, and all the basics in life even a TV, but there is no chance I would watch any of the brainwashing that it spews out and I can feed and&nbsp; care for my dog which probably eats more than I do the big greedy bugger, so yeah it&#039;s not that bad..... Or maybe Sainsbury&#039;s will start and accept BTC and deliver, I wouldn&#039;t shop at Sainsbury&#039;s even if the TV said I should!........ hmmm if they accepted LTC, hmmm maybe!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Or the quick answer would be not yet, but maybe hash out a plan if it should become necessary to implement LTC in the future.<br />I have not looked into LTC for some months so some of my understanding may have changed.<br /><br /><br />Thanks <br /><br />(I&#039;m)Real (and it&#039;s) Brand New<br />
