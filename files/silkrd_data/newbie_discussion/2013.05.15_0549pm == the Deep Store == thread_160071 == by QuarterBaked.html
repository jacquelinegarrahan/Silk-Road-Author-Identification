				so I found this site called the Deep Store that sells new (supposedly) genuine Apple products for half of the US retail price, and was just wondering if anyone had tried it out or know of someone who did? coming from a european country with a sh*tload of taxes on all sorts of electronics, getting these products at this price would be amazing! <br /><br />http://ggu4grcoqonuhkej.onion/index.txt

				I think &quot;if it seems too good to be true, it usually is&quot; applies here. If they were legit they could easily set up shop on bitcoin-otc or one of these market sites and get a trust rating before moving to their own site.

				ah man.. I could really use a new phone.. besides, getting the phone at half the retail price and selling it for a tad more could also end up potentially being a nice little business...

It happens all the time with FE&#039;ing on Silk Road, for instance; &quot;30% extra if I FE, I can make a shitload of money on that, awesome!&quot; has led to more people being ripped off than I can even stomach counting. Beware in-built, insidious human greed - it is very much a part of our collective nature, but it must be controlled in order to reduce risk.<br /><br />&quot;Think with your head, not with your heart&quot; as they say!<br /><br />Libertas

				all right guys, thanks a lot for the advice! I guess I&#039;ll just stay away from it, rather safe than sorry. could probably make enough money to buy these products locally by selling a batch or two of weed bulk orders ;D <br /><br />once again, thanks a lot for your input! much appreciated!

				I wouldn&#039;t trust offers that seem to good to be true. Also, if they sell stolen items, you may find that you are unable to get them serviced if they break down, since sometimes Apple tracks stolen goods&#039; serial numbers.

				Check out bitmit.net&nbsp; &nbsp; . there is less traffic so there are less items to choose from but you are competing with a smaller group of bidders also.
