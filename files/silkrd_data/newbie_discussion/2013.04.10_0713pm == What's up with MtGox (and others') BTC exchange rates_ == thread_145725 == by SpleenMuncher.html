				Prices have dropped more than $100 USD/BTC in the last 6 hours. I&#039;ve seen people mention &#039;hackers&#039;, but is that the case at all? Is it not just people selling their BTC for profits after the recent jumps in BTC prices?

				its been said elsewhere that a ddos is in progress (this would stand to reason as if you look at the engine lag it would make sense) people are panicking and selling off. Now is the time to buy!!<br /><br />Mtgox trading engine lag: 3839.89s

				So you think it&#039;s going to go back to it&#039;s $240 USD prices and likely even higher?

				in short, yes. buy as soon as you can at the lower prices, this will be over in a matter of hours and slowly begin to creep back up, next week this dip will be as if it never happened and it will still be creeping up.<br /><br />This is coming from the various sources I trust. Its only small money panicking at the moment cashing out as they see it fall,&nbsp; the big money is waiting it out and will start (by at least tomorrow morning) buying up all the cheap coins slowly at first. Now is the time

				yeah this stuff bugs me out man. its like, should i keep my coin in my wallet to grow in value or spend it now on drugs?&nbsp; If i keep it for a little it goes up, i get more drugs, if it goes down then i lose my money.&nbsp; I just like to make purchases as soon as i get the coin so i dont have to worry about that.&nbsp; But then i see the price rise greatly like this past week and im like dammit i shoulda kept em in my wallet.
