				I was reading in the security forum and someone posted that packages might be marked &quot;in transit&quot; but not shipped out for 24 hours.&nbsp; Why in the hell would someone do that?&nbsp; We pay a priority for the shipping type that we choose and have expectations.&nbsp; Don&#039;t mark an order &quot;in transit&quot; when it isn&#039;t and then come back with &#039;oops post office is slow&#039;&nbsp; If I want something delivered regular first class mail that&#039;s how I&#039;ll order.&nbsp;

				Unless the package has been dropped off into the mail a vendor should not move the order into &quot;in transit&quot;. If you find this not to be the case do not use that vendor again imo.

				Some less than scrupulous vendors will mark your order &#039;in transit&#039; so you can&#039;t cancel while they resupply, or sort out some other bullshit resulting from them being a shitty drug dealer.

				It&#039;s infuriating when it&#039;s marked &quot;in transit&quot; and then when you get the package it actually wasn&#039;t in transit for a few days to a week before it actually was the mail

				If vendors were more honest with their customer about ship times&nbsp; SR would be amazing. <br /><br />It&#039;s annoying to wait for a package and not know really if it has even been shipped. <br /><br />Oh wait, but this is a drug mkt so it doesn&#039;t matter.

				So far 2 vendors I&#039;ve used would ship it then mark it in transit the next day, pming that they shipped it yesterday.&nbsp; 1 Had 100 rating the other had no rating.&nbsp; Its just like dealing with this in real life but with ratings and an escrow system gotta love it.
