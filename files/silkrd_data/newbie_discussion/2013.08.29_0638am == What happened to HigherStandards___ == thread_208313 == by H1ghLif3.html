				I placed and order with HS a few days ago, and I log on today to see the their vendor account is no longer valid. I place multple orders with HS, and all experience with HS have been fantastic. I&#039;ve enjoyed doing business with HS and would like to know what happen to them, I&#039;m ready for them to come back for some more Medical MJ and their delicious hash oil.<br /><br />Thanks ~H1ghLif3

				most probably cleaned house and have left the building so to speak. some Australian domestic vendors perfected this method, be reliable and build a massive customer base and then roll on all of them, ripping them all off at the same time. question is how much money does it take to turn a good vendor bad? sad thing is they probably just start a new account. and yes they got me
