				Been totally into the idea of baking again! Haha I make some mean edibles, its been awhile! The idea dawned on me recently once I saw these fabulous prices for cuttings and trim here on the road. Both vendors seem to be getting very excellent reviews from new and veteran customers it seems, so once financially inclined for purchase I want to know who I will be purchasing from. One problem is, I&#039;m somewhat a noob to the road and very VERY new to these forums. I know nothing personally about the quality of each product and all that jazz let alone the vendors themselves! So I thought to make this poll to see if any fellow noobs or anyone has had the opportunity to purchase from either vendor. If so, please place your vote and fill me in on the experience with your purchase. Along with your satisfaction and/or dissatisfaction with the product and for what reason? Was there a shit load of stems or seeds you had to pick through? was it on point? any popcorn nuggets? any good sift to smoke?(though majority will consist of being used for edibles on my behalf, I still got my chillum to toke for sure) anything like that, you know? I truly want to get to know as much about each product before buying. haha call me cheap because both listings are a massive bang for the buck I&#039;m trying to earn, but hell money don&#039;t come easy for me! I want to make the most of what I can make the most of! Then make it LAST!.. hahaha; So.. anyone&#039;s input is truly appreciated, and I wish you all a goodnight! <br />&nbsp;:D<br />-Dreadkn0t

				I am honored you are considering my trim listings. Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have. I don&#039;t doubt FarmGuy also has a great product.<br /><br />I know the words of my customer&#039;s carry much more weight then mine ever could so hopefully some will chime in soon.<br /><br /><br />Here is the recent feedback for my trim listing:<br /><br />&quot;Quick shipping. 3 days to the midwest. Stealthy shipping, sealed well and no smell. Overweight. Great quality. Overall great purchase.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;FE because farmer1 so deserves it (though he never asked or even hinted at it, completely of my own free will).<br />If you haven&#039;t purchased from this vendor, you seriously don&#039;t know what you are missing. Absolutely everything about this vendor couldn&#039;t possibly be better. Thanks farmer1! The community loves you!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Great communication. Easy to work with. Fast shipping. Oh, and the trim is pretty damn nice!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;dude that was an awesome deal&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Excellent As Always!! A+++ Be Back Soon, TY Farmer1(100)&quot;<br /><br />&quot;2 day delivery! great service&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Fast delivery. Let me say that I got what I think is about 40g of very nice popcorn bud. The trim is nice itself, bery sticky and smells wonderful. Awesome transaction. 5/5&quot;<br /><br />&quot;fast shipping, about an 8th overweight, phenomenal smell and taste. will be back for more.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Excellent In Every Way!! A+++ , Will Be Ordering More Now!! TY Farmer1(100)!!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Exactly what I needed, when I needed it.&quot;

				Also on my review thread (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35630.0;topicseen) the most recent review is for my trim listing.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=35630.msg1333619#msg1333619">Quote from: debbydownerr on July 12, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Let me start out by first stating how awesomely good at communication and customer service farmer1 is. Being a cool dude will always give some vendors an inherent advantage over others. Package was stealthy, overweight and arrived in two days to the midwest.<br /><br />I ordered the QP of trim listing, and I&#039;m blown away at what a good deal this is. It&#039;s packed with popcorn nugs. This stuff is fire, one of the best I&#039;ve had off the road. I love this pure hybrid strain imo, very heady and good indica burn as well (seems like best of both worlds to me, without sedating indica qualities). It tastes great vaporized, with OG kush and diesel being the two most distinctive flavors that pop out to me.<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to blast these nugs too. Really excited to see how the BHO turns out (I may post pics).<br /><br />You are special, don&#039;t change!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Hopefully this info helps you make your decision.<br /><br />Thank you for your interest and best regards.

				I want to get some of farmer1 skush trim as a present for myself when my broke ass can finally get paid soon, so I think you should get some and make a review of it so I know how it is. <br /><br />The reviews of skush are off the charts, and I am very into the indica that people are describing. Its more money but the quality seems worth it.<br /><br />farmer1, I hope we can do business sometime in the future as i am eager to try your product and you seem to be very professional in your transactions.

				word carlos i hear you on that, i think once i make enough money i will probably end up getting them both and post some reviews and continue to go through whoever satisfies the most. i mean im not sure what to expect when both of them get such great reviews, and even though farmguys review consist of great quality and to be excessively overweight, i feel biting the bullet to pay which is about 10 bucks more for farmer1 stuff is still just a steal and totally worth it, hence it is the skush and def in my opinion the higher quality sift(not to mention the bud itself by the ounce is sold at standard prices), which is getting just as great of reviews, but to make the commitment to pay a bit more cash from what an ounce would cost, to get a quap of the leftover trim/shake! so i mean both are a steal, i def need to save some funds i want to get to both of them and make some reviews. i love doing that kind of stuff! haha and making edibles as ive said! i do make great unique edibles sometimes for my sweet tooth and sometimes healthy ones(why not?!) but ANYWAY yeah im looking forward to the future to see what i can do, i wanted to ask farmer1 has your trim been tumbled or essentially drained of keif or been touched anyway, or is it exactly as you and your people left it post trimming? let me know, take care yall!<br />-DK
