				Hey guys, got another question for ya. I was just noticing that some vendors will have 0 transactions and only been around for a few months and yet they&#039;re in the top 95% ranking. How is this possible? What affects a vendor&#039;s rank? Can they just pay for it or something? Thanks.

				Well... according to the wiki<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Ratings_%26_Reviews<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Vendors are weighted (and ranked) by the following two factors:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Total sales<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Freshness of those sales <br /><br />The weighted sum of a vendor&#039;s ratings are displayed next to their name and on their homepage. The relative weighted sum of each rating group (1 through 5) is displayed in a vendor rating widget that looks like a bar chart when browsing items and on a vendor&#039;s page as well. These are meant to give you a quick impression of a vendor&#039;s quality. If you want to dig deeper, you can click on the widget and see a full breakdown of a vendor&#039;s ratings. In the top right, you&#039;ll see the weighted distribution of ratings (same as the widget) and the unweighted distribution. The unweighted distribution is a simple average of all ratings with no weights as described above. Below this are all of the reviews that have been left for the vendor, organized by each rating group. You can sort these by either their weight or freshness. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t see vendor age in there... nor in the formulas that follow that paragraph, so idk.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just like a default bottom value or something?

				No they cant pay for it. with 0 transactions they still have no bad feedback where some vendor account have 100% bad feedback which places them lower.&nbsp; Its some math calculation judged on amount of sales, cost of product sold buyers rank who gave the 5/5 feedback etc

				i think its a combination of $ money through your account and # of transactions<br /><br /><br />btw top 95 is not good..... top 5% is good<br /><br /><br /><br />the more volume through your acct the lower your % is
