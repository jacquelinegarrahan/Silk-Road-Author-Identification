				<br />I would stay away from them. Something is going on. I have been waiting awhile for my wire transfer to come in and all I get from them is crap. I have a open ticket and I opened a chat secession with them. Here is how it went.<br /><br />ME<br /><br />I need you to check this ticket&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />please<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Danny&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Let me check on this. Please wait<br />&nbsp;<br />ME&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />ok&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />thank you so much for your help... I am kind of freaked out now<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Danny&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Please note that our bank has made few changes to the deposit procedure - https://support.mtgox.com/entries/21692589-Changes-to-Deposit-Transfer-Procedures<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Danny&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />So it will take more time than usual and we will follow up with this ticket.<br />&nbsp;<br />ME&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />how much is more time? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Should I cancel the wire?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Danny&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />It depends on the banking process and how faster the transfers are sent.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Danny&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />We will update you once the deposit is located.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Danny&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />No you do not have you. we should be receiving this sooner<br /><br />&nbsp; Danny has left the room<br /><br /><br />Dude just bailed on me! I have no idea when the wire will post to my account. Now I am going to try my luck with Virwox as soon as I figure out how to use them.

				Gox is known for being extremely shitty with customer service. Most likely since they&#039;re based in Japan, so most of their staff doesn&#039;t speak English...<br /><br />That and they&#039;ve been the largest exchange for a while so they can just rest on their laurels and nobody will switch to anyone else simply because of brand recognition.<br /><br />But recently, since they no longer with with OKPay or Dwolla, there&#039;s really no reason at all to bother with these butthorns. Just use BitInstant or btc-e or one of the MoneyPak &lt;--&gt; Bitcoin listings on SR.<br /><br />

				Bitinstant.com has &quot;temporarily&quot; closed up shop. Their excuse is that it&#039;s to update their website, but that doesn&#039;t make any sense. Real companies prepare updates then implement them. I consider their shutting down a strong indicator that they have/had some sort of major problem(s). Regulators, hackers, or weak financials would be my guess. <br />Regulators most likely, but the recent big bitcoin drop could have hurt their position. Hackers/site vulnerability being my 3rd guess.

				My trouble is that OKPay will no longer deal with US customers. So that makes localbitcoins tough for me.
