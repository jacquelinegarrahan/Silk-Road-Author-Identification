				I&#039;ve been buying bitcoins through BitFloor.&nbsp; But now they have raised their rates from 1% to any from 1-4%.&nbsp; Makes a big difference.&nbsp; Can anyone shed some light on a better option for buying bitcoins.&nbsp; I am in the process of making an account through&nbsp; Mt.Gox.&nbsp; Of course its telling me I have to verify my account, but I figured if I just bounced the money around from wallet to wallet in random increments I should be good.&nbsp; Any Feedback?&nbsp; Is this a safe method?

				There isn&#039;t really a big difference with Bitfloor. I recommend requesting deposit amounts and cancelling them until you get a better deal. Don&#039;t just accept the first amount they give you. It will always be different. You can save quite a bit of money that way. I haven&#039;t even noticed the rate increases to be honest.

				A friend of mine recommended bitinstant as well. They look legit, I haven&#039;t used it yet. You can also buy bitcoins at CVS I heard too, haven&#039;t done that yet. <br /><br />

				for a high fee, SugarMama is a safe bet, long history of being legit, my first order was through her and was spot on. If you don&#039;t want to wait the up to two days it can take, or you don&#039;t want to pay that high of a fee, bitinstant works good, though once in a while they have issues.

				CVS is just one of the possible ways for using BitInstant. You do a moneygram order there. You&#039;re not actually buying BTC from CVS.

				ok....thanks for all the advice on bitinstant, but I&#039;m really more interested in using Mt.Gox.&nbsp; Is it safe?&nbsp; I mean for all anyone needs to know I&#039;m just an investor right?&nbsp; Is there anyway to track where I&#039;m moving the BTCs if I am bouncing them around randomly???
