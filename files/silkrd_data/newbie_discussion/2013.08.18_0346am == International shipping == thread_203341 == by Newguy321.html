				<br />I was wondering what kind of experience people are having with international shipping. I see some good priced stuff in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe but I have always ordered domestic inside the US.<br /><br />It seems with things like customs and other hoops to go through it would increase the risk of being caught.<br /><br />This is all small quantities for personal use btw.

				Netherlands has actually been very good to me. I&#039;ve gotten 2 orders NL &gt; NE US in about a week. Canadian packages get to me in 3 weeks or more though...

				If the person shipping internationally knows what they are doing, and you are not ordering an absurd amount of a substance, then you should be fine.<br /><br />Always keep in mind there is a risk associated with purchasing controlled substances...domestically or internationally.

				Thanks for the info. There seems to be a lot of vendors with &quot;Dutch&quot; in there name. I hope that they are all separate and not one scammer.

				Has anyone had good experiences getting packages from England to the US?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried but heard it&#039;s usually difficult to make a successful shipment.<br /><br />It would be a great resource to have a list of generally successful country-to-country pairings, although I agree that effective stealth packaging always vastly improves your chances.

				Uk to the USA his really heavily looked at because most of the Canadian and Dutch seeds venders have began shipping form the UK because its the only country that has no laws regarding Cannabis seeds and that business is a major business now with things changing in the USA .<br /><br />GF

Now I understand most don&#039;t want to single out their federal state but giving an answer for the US as a whole is simply impossible, imagine the absurdity of a statement saying a package entering China has a predictable risk of getting caught on that basis alone.<br /><br />The thing that can help the most is Packaging though as the majority of Vendors are currently utilizing vacuum solutions which will fail after 1-7 days depending on how many layers ( see the thread STEALTH THAT WORKS - DITCH THE PE FOOD GRADE VAC SEAL: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458 ), in other words in the majority of the cases they will almost fail every single time when sent from abroad and the only thing that can save that package then is Luck.<br />----------<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Uk to the USA his really heavily looked at because most of the Canadian and Dutch seeds venders have began shipping form the UK because its the only country that has no laws regarding Cannabis seeds and that business is a major business now with things changing in the USA .<br /><br />GF</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This was interesting, do you happen to have any articles for more information on this matter?
