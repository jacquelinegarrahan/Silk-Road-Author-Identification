				&nbsp;I&#039;ve received the registered letter.&nbsp; Second after the post office whore gave me the letter a man next to me screamed &quot;pollice!&quot; attempted to hold me but I ran away. Two other were outside the post offece near their car. They followed to chase me. I ran through the urban thrashy neighborhood. I tried to tore the letter and have thrown the torn to some pieces letter across the fence. And being about to die ranning the remaining 800 meters to my house. <br />They knocked but didn&#039;t get in.<br />This morning i found most parts of the letter an destroyed. <br />Now the question is, how securely is tor connection encrypted. I mean can my provider listen the e-traffic and provide proofs that i applied&nbsp; to this web site made order and gave the address where to send? How much is the possibility that it&#039;s possible or not possible. Pleas explain on fingers for newbie. I have a pc here at home. I also have a wifi access point. Both connected through switch to the twisted pair cable. The wifi is not protected has no password. How can they find out which computer was used to connect to this web site? Should i destroy the Ethernet adapter in this computer. Can I say if they ask me that it could be anyone why applied to this website through my wifi, any pedestrian or neighbor unless they have my ethernet adapter and prove that it was MAC-address on this computer. <br />&nbsp;I&#039;m sorry there can be mistakes, I&#039;m not native english speaker. Please answer every question you know or guess the answer. This is very urgent. I don&#039;t want to pris. If you have friends on this forum ask them. Please if possible copy this thread to security branch. I am afraid to give more information because if the low read this forum it can be a circumstantial evidence<br />I also use a fake name and can be that other time i post from other forum name if i forget the password.

				Controlled delivery could be due to many things other than TOR ... More likely package stealth not up to the task and was detected. LE may have then looked at the addressee and any past criminal history and decided you were worth a CD possibly in the hope of then gaining a warrant to search your home ... The item and size of your order would also play a part.<br />It would sound like overkill to bust someone receiving 1gm of bud ... Importation from overseas will also bring far more attention !

Are you a past offender? Have you came under any sort of heat in the past? Your story sounds kind of weird, maybe even fake. If you were evading police, as in running&nbsp; from them, you woulda got your door kicked in.

				The story is not fake. You don&#039;t need to ask this question again or post here if you don&#039;t trust me. I was asked as a witness to give testimony about 8 years ago. Because that times money were transferred through bank system an apparently they have caught someone who ordered a lot and he testified how he did the transfer to diminish his guilt. Hope this makes sence. So they examined everyone who transferred to that address.<br />&nbsp;I can not give any detail about the country yet because as i said it can be circumstantial evidence that i have actually ordered something from here. I&#039;m just afraid. More information may be tomorrow if i have time.

				Stories like this make me wish I was a lawyer. I would definitely want to be a defense attorney. How awesome would it be to make up some complete bullshit as a defense for this, although I think it&#039;s complete bs. Cops have better things to do that stand at a PO all day waiting for you to show up I would think. If they were there, and this is real, I have to think they followed you there to pick it up. I wouldn&#039;t blame a computer either. I would be more worried the stealth failed or somehow they found out what was in the package. Would help to know the country. You run from cops in the US they are gonna take down your door and give you an ass whipping to boot for making them chase you. They aren&#039;t just gonna knock and go away. The minute you ran they had probable cause to kick your door in. Anyway, Better Call Saul! And forget that you know any English.

				I agree with the majority of posters - this story makes little sense and doesn&#039;t seem likely at all.<br /><br />However it&#039;s probably worth answering the technical questions, so new folks can understand risks better. Let&#039;s turn an incoherant paranoid delusion into something valuable :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178311.msg1284970#msg1284970">Quote from: dfgdfgdfsgdsf on June 28, 2013, 09:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Now the question is, how securely is tor connection encrypted. I mean can my provider listen the e-traffic and provide proofs that i applied&nbsp; to this web site made order and gave the address where to send? ... <br />How can they find out which computer was used to connect to this web site?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your tor connection is strongly encrypted. But most importantly it&#039;s anonymous, meaning your tor traffic can not be tracked back to your home IP. At all. (Unless you are using one of those clearweb -&gt; tor proxies. Don&#039;t use those.)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178311.msg1284970#msg1284970">Quote from: dfgdfgdfsgdsf on June 28, 2013, 09:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should i destroy the Ethernet adapter in this computer... they have my ethernet adapter and prove that it was MAC-address on this computer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your MAC address never leaves your local network. Meaning only your wifi router will know it. You can also change it at any time. So it is totally irrelevant. Even if LE were running a website that you connected to they wouldn&#039;t have your MAC address. And even if they did, you can change it any time you like with software - it proves nothing.<br /><br />As others have said, if this story were true (which it likely isn&#039;t) the reason for a cop takedown will be the package stealth, or possibly a fake vendor. Tor will not be the weak point.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: dfgdfgdfsgdsf</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can someone explain if tor is enaugh secure why people use pgp than?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re conflating two different things. Tor is secure and anonymous - nobody SR can see what you&#039;re doing on SR, and nobody at all can tell that it&#039;s you who is connecting to SR. PGP is used to ensure that even the SR operators can&#039;t read a message, only the intended recipient can. Given how sensitive addresses are, this makes sense, in case of a compromise of SR. PGP also allows secure messaging outside of SR if necessary, and again the messages can only be read by the recipient, regardless of what mail server or whatever they sit on.

I would definitely want to be a defense attorney. How awesome would it be to make up some complete bullshit as a defense for this, although I think it&#039;s complete bs. Cops have better things to do that stand at a PO all day waiting for you to show up I would think. If they were there, and this is real, I have to think they followed you there to pick it up. I wouldn&#039;t blame a computer either. I would be more worried the stealth failed or somehow they found out what was in the package. Would help to know the country. You run from cops in the US they are gonna take down your door and give you an ass whipping to boot for making them chase you. They aren&#039;t just gonna knock and go away. The minute you ran they had probable cause to kick your door in. Anyway, Better Call Saul! And forget that you know any English.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />He isn&#039;t from the US, you can guess where he is from, it&#039;s not that hard. <br />Given the fact you were in the thread where the Op gave away all deniability and anonymity and made the case for LE and you didn&#039;t see it coming, I&#039;d say you&#039;d suck as an attorney, you though have the part where you tell a lot of BS pretty well covered up already. <br /><br />OP if it&#039;s no bullshit, lawyer up. Stop speaking about previous trials because it all narrows it down to you. If you&#039;re using Tor correctly, it&#039;s not what gave you away. <br />Since you were able to tear that package while running from the cops it wasn&#039;t a big sending, I guess. I think it was a dumb move to come back and and clean up yourself, but since you signed and are recognizable by the officers making the arrest, and they know what wad in the package, I don&#039;t think it makes any difference. <br /><br />Good luck if there is any truth to what you say. <br />

				The cops hung around at a post office waiting for you? That sounds quite strange! Also I&#039;m quite surprised they left you alone once you got to your house!<br /><br />Anyway if the story is legit you have made a few mistakes here.. first you went to post office and signed for a letter you knew to be drugs!!<br /><br />Now the first one could of easily been rectified by most lawyers because most people would sign for a letter that is addressed to them even if they wasn&#039;t expecting anything, so this very rarely holds up in court! But you then went on to make your second mistake which was running when the man shouted police. This action basically is the same as admitting you have done something wrong!<br /><br />Thirdly you started ripping up the letter showing you knew exactly what you had done wrong and it was in the letter!<br /><br />Finally you led the police straight back to your home!<br /><br />I would say forget about what they get of your computer (Which probably wont be a lot as tor is quite well protected) you have probably give them enough with how you reacted to the incident

				are you even old enough to make a fake story sound just a bit true? <br /><br />before making a troll thread, search the forum and you will find your answer about tor encryprion / why use PGP<br />
