				there is a small utensil called a coke spoon that works wonders.&nbsp; slim enough to fit into a bag and scoop up.&nbsp; I usually zero the cap on the scale, and eye out the amount i&#039;m working with and then throw it back onto the scaled, which is zeroed to the weight of the capsule

				#1 get a carat scale<br />#2 a glass bowl (with your medicine in it)<br />#3 size 4 caps<br />#$ latex gloves<br />#6 take size 4 capsules and just stab them in the bowl.<br /><br />size 4&#039;s typically hold between 150--170mgs......if people dont feel your medicine then your shit is junk and been stepped on too much.

				Gel caps off eBay, some good pocket digital scales (got mine from Amazon), and a dolls-house spoon. (I found one in a charity shop for 30p and it&#039;s perfect, lol). Also a little cone made from paper helps when filling the cap. <br />As above said though, weigh the cap then zero the counter before you fill it.

				i suggest using size 4&#039;s so you dont have to worry about a funnel or spoon....if youre making hundreds its very time consuming..<br /><br />just stabb them full and cap. size 4&#039;s stuffed full will never be over 200. carat scale every 10 or so just to ensure some consistency.<br /><br />unless youre very small scale and only making a couple then use a carat scale them all.

				Awesome tips from everyone.&nbsp; Thank y&#039;all for the info.<br /><br />I found a $10 digital scale (only 3&quot; x 5&quot;) on Amazon and got some size 4 caps.<br /><br />Anyone have any favorite recipes for blending&nbsp; MDMA and bk-MDMA in caps? For example, a decent ratio of the two to achieve a moderate roll versus an intense roll?

				You are going to need a very good scale. One like the durascale d2 300 its a 0.01 scale. I love it

				whats up guys i use 00 and 0 gelatin caps. and shit might sound ghetto as fuck but take a straw and cut the tip of it to like a 85% angle and scoup it from the bag and go straight to the cap.<br />this has been the best way and you dont waist any molly at all it all stays on the straw!&nbsp;

				I like to use a plastic drinking straw cut at an angle to scoop the powder. The straws I use fit perfectly inside a #4 cap.

				Damn sounds like some of you guys make it complicated.<br /><br />What I do is pour my shit into a shot glass, and fold 2 rectangular pieces of paper (not full size sheet, like 1.5in x 3in)<br /><br />use the shotglass and pour the shit onto the scale in 100mg doses, take each 100mg dose and put it on the folded piece of paper, then grab an empty and tip the piece of paper so the stuff just slides into the capsule. <br /><br />I use 00 capsules but I can see how it would be difficult to do with size 4&#039;s.
