				Vacum seal it.<br /><br />First in a zip bag. Then zip bag in a small vacum bag. Make sure it is as flat as you can make it, no klumbs. Put vacum bag in industrial envelope (With adress printed on A4 paper, put goodie bag within ofc.)

				Thanks for the fast reply man!<br /><br />Have you ever heard of anyone doing competitions for free or discounted items to get their names out or do you think this could work?&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />also do these Image verification things take forever for everyone to do? LOL

				dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0 <br />if you&#039;re selling international vac seal can leak smell..<br />most vendors offer free samples to trusted members for reviews to get started. i doubt many people would enter a competition with a new vendor, could be a honeypot. good luck though, what you selling teamGB? performance enhancing drugs? ;)

				Competitions, yes. But not as a new vendor. Only for new product from popular vendor. But there is a first for everything.<br /><br />BTW. When I say industry envelope, I mean one with somekind of &quot;official&quot; logo on it. Seems to work best. I am not a vendor myself. Just mentioning what have had the best arrival stats for me.<br /><br />If you are selling roids though... A different approach is needed :)

				Thanks for the replies guys!<br /><br />I am going to roam the site for a few days so I can learn the &quot;Do&#039;s and Do not&#039;s&quot;. <br /><br />Ron Swanson, I have recently come across an amount of freshly pressed TeamGB mdma pills along with some other select items. If I had those I would of named myself Team Armstrong xD.<br /><br />If anyone could show/tell me how to upload pictures without leaving a trace, I would love to upload a few <br /><br />Thanks TeamGB

				look into scrubbing exif and metadata from images then use an onion uploader. should be info on the forums. maybe security section. it&#039;s not something i&#039;ve ever needed to do personally though. someone more knowledgeable might pop in here. you can always politely pm members who know their stuff and ask for pointers. be prepared to be ignored though with low post count etc. if you can get up past 50 posts you can post anywhere on here and yeah people generally will be helpful :) when you get past 100 posts you don&#039;t have to do the captchas anymore btw
