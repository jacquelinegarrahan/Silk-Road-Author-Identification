				I&#039;m just curious whether you guys are going to use SR for a really long time, or if there&#039;s going to be a time that you&#039;ll stop<br /><br />I think I can see myself using it for a pretty long time, assuming there&#039;s no bumps in the road along the way...<br />

				For me, this is the best (and sometimes only) option I have.&nbsp; I am an &quot;older,&quot; professional woman, so finding connections can be quite the challenge for me.&nbsp; I cannot afford to buy opiate pills here, and I do have a decent connect for that, but that is it.&nbsp; Most of my friends have no idea that I &quot;dabble,&quot; lol, and the only connects I would have in &quot;real life&quot; would be for weed, which I do not care for at all.&nbsp; This is the answer to all my problems, and it worked so much smoother than I could have imagined.

				Until it&#039;s untimely demise, be it due to too many newcomers not doing their research and compromising the site to the point of it being too dangerous to conduct business on anymore, or LE in my country having enough of their draconian controlled substance laws being circumvented by a small but growing number of tech-savvy libertines who enjoy the finer things in life.<br /><br />I just hope I meet enough people through this site before it shuts down to have a handful of trusted contacts to be in the loop when the next SR pops up.&nbsp; It&#039;ll obviously never go away...it&#039;ll just be harder to find.&nbsp; <br /><br />Make sure you have your most trusted contacts&#039; email addresses stored somewhere off-site...not trying to sound like a doomsday prophet but better safe than sorry.

				Until it&#039;s broken and no longer works. Why would we stop? Would you stop using Amazon... or eBay... or [insert name of commercial website here]? Aside from the horrific scamming that can take place here, it&#039;s both covert and convenient. If all goes smoothly, I may never again leave the house to go buy drugs and then carry them on me in public until I get back (I hate that part).<br /><br />Perhaps I heard the question incorrectly... are you asking &quot;How long do you guys plan to use Mind Altering Substances&quot;?<br /><br />So far it&#039;s been most of my life, so I see no reason to stop now.
