				Hi everyone.<br />Like I&#039;ve said in other posts I am a new vendor on SR. I have a few questions for established vendors or anyone really. I&#039;m just eagerly waiting to make my first sale and get things going. I know how important feedback and stats are to everyone here and I think that is kinda whats holding me back at this point but I&#039;m just looking for a few tips on how to get things rolling. I&#039;ve had a few buyers send me messages asking for free product. I have replied and made it pretty clear I think in my listings also that I will be throwing extras in with any orders i get but I&#039;m not sure that just flat out sending product for free without any kind of payment is the message I want to be sending to buyers. If anyone could give me a few pointers on what worked for them or even just ideas on the subject would be very much appreciated.<br />Thanks

				Usually people like when there are reviews of free samples so they know they don&#039;t risk getting ripped off, but the free samples should preferably be given to respected forum members that will actually write a thorough review on the forums for you. Most vendors give out 1 or 3 free samples and that&#039;s usually enough to attract customers, if your product and service are both good that is.

				Im a newer member of this forum but I&#039;m definately not new to psychoactives and if anyone where to offer me a free sample I would definately write an experience report. I dont take psychoactives just for the fun of it, It is as much my profession as it is a hobby. I keep detailed reports of all my journys

				I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;d make a good reviewer, DMT, seeing how much you know on psychedelics, but you&#039;d need at least 50 post.. Reviews in the newbie section aren&#039;t very interesting since they get buried by spam pretty quickly.

				Thank you guys!&nbsp; :) <br />Tree, so going about getting a few free samples out to some respected forum members.... I guess how do I go about that as a whole? First how would I identify these members? How should I attract these members to actually accept some samples? And should I make a special order in SR for this kind of transaction so that these members will be able to add to my positive stats/feedback on SR? (And if so how do I go about doing that without making a listing for anyone and everyone to see and take part in?)<br /><br />@DMT,<br />You sound like you might actually like the one thing I am prepared to be selling. I specialize in mushroom capsules. Here is a link to the two listing that I have going right now if you would like to check them out.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/dc5b2bcac6<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b23e5757a8<br /><br />Thank you guys again!

				Well to get the reviewers coming you start a thread in product offers that goes something like &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; FREE SAMPLES &lt;&lt;&lt; New vendor : Shroom capsules &gt;honest reviews needed&lt;&quot; or whatever would attract their attention. And then you explain your terms and to whom you&#039;d like to send samples. I&#039;d send one to DMT :P You could also contact Ballz&#039; and Blargh&#039;s reliable reviewers, they&#039;re good reviewers. Tell them you want them to write a detailed feedback on the forums and then put the link to the reviews on your page so that people know how your service is.<br /><br />You can make a stealth listing and only send the link to the reviewers. It should cost $0 and preferably free shipping too as most people don&#039;t like free samples where you pay shipping, that would add to your score and at least show that you completed a couple of transactions.

				Tree,<br />Thank you so much for the amazing advice!!!! I&#039;m not sure if you are much interested in my products but I would be willing to throw you a sample if you would like also. Let me know. I also like your suggestion for getting some to DMT and Hey , D I&#039;ll hit you up when I am all set to get this in order. Also, I have sent things before and have things secure for sending within the US but if you guys are from other countries I&#039;m gonna need some pointers on best practices for sending out of country.<br />Thanks again!!! ;D

				lol, I know I would need at least 50 post, give me another hour Ill be there. Thats what I&#039;ve been trying to do all day, I just dont want to get there by posting spam, I hate spam and it does nothing to help this forum.<br /><br />Mushroom capsules are actually exactly what I have been looking for. Now if only I saw the listing a few days ago when I had some bitcoins, now I have to wait a freaking week before more BTC shows up in my account... Coinbase is dreadfully slow.

				Yes please do, As I said, my BTC wont be in until a week from now (for some reason coinbase takes a week for transactions to process, I wont use bitinstant because they screwed me, and mtgox requires too much personal information.) Mushroom caps will definitely be on my next order, Just make sure they are competitively priced and I will definitely help you get going here. Let me get 50 posts, and If I get some of your shroom caps I will definately write a detailed experience report and as long as the product is satisfactory (its shrooms, I dont see how it wouldnt be) I will recommend you to people, seems I&#039;m already getting a little bit of a following on here lol.

				I would gladly review your samples in return for feedback and trip reports. I just got through reviewing 25c-NBOMe for silo, P.E. Cubensis for AmericaOnDrugs, and DMT for RingoDeathstarr. You can check my post history. I provide detailed trip reports and honest feedback. I have experience with almost every psychedelic and know how to compare qualities well. You can find my trip report for Ringo&#039;s DMT in several different threads. I am in the process of finishing my reports for the 25c-NBOMe and shrooms. PM me with more info if you&#039;re interested.

				I&#039;d gladly like a sample but I won&#039;t be able to receive it for some time, by then you&#039;ll probably already have an established reputation. If you still want to give me a sample I&#039;ll PM you on the forums when I&#039;ll be able to get it :) Mushroom caps seems pretty cool!

				When I buy from a new vendor, I start with something small.<br /><br />I suggest putting up some auctions for people to spend less than $50, closer to like $30 would be good.<br /><br />Also, sell them cheaper to draw in new customers.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, you are selling 10/325 norcs for $10 (what these cost on here is ridiculous).&nbsp; There are sellers with more experience and feedback selling them for cheaper.&nbsp; Also, there are lots of comparable items like oxycodone, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone that come out cheaper when you do the calculations (I know the comparison of opioids and how to calculate the cost per 10mg across all of them&nbsp; There are sellers that have them as low as $5 per 10mg so you are double that).&nbsp; You may have to take a loss but that is what you should be willing to do when starting out to gain business.&nbsp; That is going to make it harder to get customers.&nbsp; I would post a listing and make it clear that it is a sale instead of standard pricing.<br /><br />Maybe list them at like $8 or even $7.50 and draw some people in.&nbsp; You have started a business and this is what businesses do to draw customers in.&nbsp; When you have competition that has better feedback selling the same thing for cheaper, you arent going to get much business, if any.

I thought the cheapest was $7.5 which is too expensive anyways. $3 a pop is what you should be paying. By the way, if you do the math, the opiate with the cheapest price per dose is morphine on here if you know the right vendors and if you IV. Dilaudid and oxymorphone are super expensive too on here, and oxycodone is super overpriced on here too. Morphine on SR is even cheaper that on the streets, but only if you know the right vendors.

				Thanks again Guys! one2bicurious, yeah I actually did post a few hydros but those are really kinda a one time thing. Just some that I happened to have and no I didn&#039;t have them priced at $10. Like I said those are not really my focused product and if they don&#039;t sell that is fine actually but weird thig is I&#039;ve already sold one of the two listings for the hydros. <br />Tree- you have been great. Hit me up when you are ready to try a few caps.<br />Everyone else, thanks for the interest in trying my products but I have had much interest and have made decisions for samplers. Everyone who approached me to sample would have been a great candidate and choosing was hard. Those of you who are still interested I would love to serve you and will make sure you get some extras thrown in on your orders.<br />Thanks again!<br />
