				I am almost ready to proceed with my first transaction on the road. <br /><br />Should I be signing up and logging into my bitcoin retailer via the Tor network or clear net? <br />Does the retailer you them from act as a wallet?&nbsp; or does it require you to immediately move them to a wallet?<br /><br />I have chose to go the online wallet route, from what I have read on the forum good ones are: flexcoin / blockchain.info / instawallet or easy wallet.<br /><br />How many wallets should I move my coins through?&nbsp; Retailer to one? two? three?<br />Is it advised to be in darknet for using the wallets?<br /><br />I think my process would be: <br />Buy a coin in the clearnet, transfer said coin to a wallet. Clost clearnet open Tor and log into wallet, move it to another wallet. Change my identity using Tor program and log into the second wallet and the move it to the silk road under that same Tor session.<br /><br />Anyone have any thoughts on that stuff? I&#039;m so close to getting this done..

				I don&#039;t know why to move your bitcoins all so much?&nbsp; Sounds like a lot of wasted time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only gone straight to SR wallet.&nbsp; <br />But now I just do Money Pak&#039;s.<br />

				Should I be signing up and logging into my bitcoin retailer via the Tor network or clear net? <br />I&#039;d recommend using Tor. Why not?<br /><br />Does the retailer you them from act as a wallet?&nbsp; or does it require you to immediately move them to a wallet?<br />The site you buy them on usually provides you with a wallet. There will be detailed information on such a site.<br /><br />How many wallets should I move my coins through?&nbsp; Retailer to one? two? three?<br />As many as will dull your paranoia.

				Easiest/safest method is mixing your coins, blockchain.info and bitfog (hidden service) are the most used. I use blockchain.info and its service is called &quot;send anonymously&quot;. You can send them with that service to another wallet , like instawallet, that you have only accessed through Tor. Then to SR. The fees for blockchain.info mixer is 1,5%
