				Heyy<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in trying psychedelics and just wondered what&#039;d be a good place to start. <br /><br />I&#039;m experienced in MDMA and weed blah blah blah, and interested in trying something different.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really want to do anything with long term side-effects though... But I don&#039;t know if any drugs do have any long term side effects if you just take them once...<br /><br />I was thinking maybe 2CB?

				Hey there bud, welcome to the forum :) never tried 2 cb but recently tried NBOMe that was trippy as hell (i did take 4 though lol) LSD is great and quite similar then there&#039;s DMT but cannot comment on that as iv not tried also shrooms very like LSD but im clueless to the side effects of most of these drugs sorry.

				2cb is very MDMA-like. As for a truer psychedelic experience, LSD or mushrooms would be a good starter. DMT or salvia can be a bit earth shattering for those with little psychedelic experience.

				Hey there man, I recently began my psychedelic experimentation too. I believe ketamine to be an absolutely fantastic starting point because of the short come up and come down. Also it is generally much safer and purer than a lot of psychedelics around at the moment. I wouldn&#039;t class it as a true psychedelic like LSD or the 2Cx family, but it introduces you to ego loss and CEVs (closed eye visuals) in a much more controlled way.<br /><br />There&#039;s been a huge amount of NBOMe family chemicals as well as DOx family chemicals being laid onto tabs that look like LSD. The only way to know with moderate certainty what you have is using a chemical test (such as an eztest Marquis test kit). You do need to be careful because you could develop a taste for dropping large amounts of LSD, then repeat the same dose with NBOMe and seriously freak yourself out. I am a fan of NBOMe but you have to watch out.<br /><br />If all else fails, stick to the classical psychedelics - LSD, psychedelic mushrooms, DMT, mescaline and (arguably) the 2Cx family.<br /><br />Hope that helps!

				It&#039;s dependant on what you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for a pretty light show, with lots of colours, and euphoric feeling, I would try the 25c-NBOMe drug.<br /><br />However, many critique the drug for not having a spiritual experience, which it doesn&#039;t, so it may be more useful at a festival, rather than tripping for the sake of it (I personally had a fantastic time, so check out my post history there&#039;s a trip report in the forums)<br /><br />NBOMe&#039;s are also very cheap, with LSD at a high price it might be a good place to start.<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING: http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp_list.shtml<br /><br />Check the above website for trip reports of a multitude of drugs (not just pshycs) It may be very useful!

				I would start with mushrooms as they are less overwhelming than LSD or nbome. <br />But nbome is a great experience, impossible to sleep after though.<br /><br />Salvia is good but very very expensive and lasts 5-15 minutes.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried DMT though I hear it&#039;s the greatest drug on earth :P

				I think mushrooms or LSD would be a good starting point, just don&#039;t try a ridiculous amount right off the bat.&nbsp; I started with mushrooms before Salvia and LSD. Salvia is a mindfuck.

				DMT is great, it is very intense but seems to wrap you up in a calming warm blanket during the whole experience. LSD lasts much longer and can give you trouble if you have anxiety but if you are positive in mind then it is SOOOOO fun.

				I&#039;d recommend shrooms for the first psychedelic experience. 15gr of fresh or 1.5-2gr of dry mushrooms and you will have an awesome visual and spiritual trip. The best starting point (LSD will be too heavy maybe, you can&#039;t control as much as with shrooms, and 2c-b I&#039;ve heard that is less spiritual).<br /><br />I would go for the shrooms without any doubt, just plan a good set&amp;setting

				Ketamine is absolutely superb for self-exploration. The ability to keep a (sort of) clear head and to be able to &#039;direct&#039; your thoughts towards particular subjects, the feeling of removal from emotion and your life circumstances (though you can remember them all), all these things allow for a very objective and rational evaulation of your self and situation.

				Aww I thought I could +rep people at 50 posts..<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to remember to rep you guys. Definitely will try ketamine one of these nights that I need to explore. <br /><br />Mushrooms is my favourite for self-exploration so far and they are great for making me feel good about where I&#039;m at/going. I don&#039;t like how strong my hands become though(I cracked my phone over the weekend gripping it what I thought was normal.) So if you are unsure about your strength when tripping don&#039;t pet animals or drink from glass cups!!

				Cool thread. Makes me realize how out-of-it I&#039;m these days. Used to be a time when I would try almost everything I came across. Have tried a fair amount of psychedelics, although MDMA was the one I really fell in love with. For me there has been no better drug for self-exploration. It gets you connected with your soul ( I admit I&#039;ve used many times also just to party, but lately more just to take journeys into discovering things... )&nbsp; <br />Have never tried Ketamine or 2c&#039;s , what are the dimensions they can open that MDMA can&#039;t ?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And to the original poster; if your looking for clear psychedelic experience with some depth, I would also start with mushrooms or LSD. Probably shrooms first cause they are much more gentle and would give you a feel of the &#039;other&#039; world first...

				Looks like time and time again mushrooms are recommended for a first time experience.&nbsp; Sounds like we are all on the same page :)<br /><br />Ketamine can be nice too as mentioned.&nbsp; Depends on if you want to be detached, or be totally involved and connected with the &quot;isness&quot;.

				As an enthusiastic user of all things psychedelic, I would highly recommend shrooms first. They are a good gateway into the world of self exploration, very intense but not overwhelming. Make sure you have a good playlist going, a calm stable environment, some bud if you smoke, and some orange juice. Also, keep in mind... THEY TASTE HORRIBLE, totally worth it though. Oh, and don&#039;t freak out if you get a bit of nausea, it will pass.
