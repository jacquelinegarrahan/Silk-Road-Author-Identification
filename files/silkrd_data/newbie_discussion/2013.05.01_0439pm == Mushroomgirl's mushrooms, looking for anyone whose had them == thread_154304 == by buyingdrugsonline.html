				Everyone claims that mushroomgirl is the best shroom vendor on the road, but I have heard a few people say they were disappointed because they weren&#039;t that potent. What did you think about them?

				Take the plunge and find out for yourself (once the road is opened). I&#039;m pretty confident you won&#039;t be disappointed.

				Mushroomgirl&#039;s shrooms are by far the most potent shrooms I have eaten from the road. Not only that they ship in good stealth and arrive in good condition. every stem has a cap. the only downside i would have to say is that her shrooms aren&#039;t bone dry. personally i consider this a plus because fresh mushrooms are more potent then dry mushrooms. Her mushrooms are dry though don&#039;t get it confused, they&#039;re just not cracker dry. <br /><br />So if you do order from her look up on high to store mushrooms correctly. I lost two g&#039;s to mold because i left it in a baggie in my dresser :-\. I didn&#039;t know, but i learned from my mistake.
