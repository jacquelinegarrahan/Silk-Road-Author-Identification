				What line of organics do you use?&nbsp; Do you use earthworm castings, blood meal, bone meal, fish emulsion?&nbsp; Are your nugs tight and dense or more loose?&nbsp; 600w hps or 1000w hps density?&nbsp; Or something else?&nbsp; Do you use moisture barrier bags?&nbsp; When you say skunk which skunk are you referring to and by which breeder?&nbsp; I love some nice organic buds :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you have ant pictures of your bud?

I use &quot;General Organics&quot; nutrients and Fox Farm Ocean Forest soil. I would say that the nugs are looser. I use LED. I do not currently use moisture barrier bags but I will in the future. I can&#039;t seem to find the webpage with the exact strain details but as far as I can remember the strain is simply called &quot;Automatic Skunk&quot;. I don&#039;t currently have pictures but I will try and post some soon.

I&#039;ve yet to find anyone that comes close. When I first made the switch to LED I was apprehensive but now that I have I&#039;ll never go back. Hopefully I&#039;ll have some reviews shortly. I don&#039;t think there are too many other people selling bud like this at such a low price.
