				So I realize that NorCalKing has great reviews. I&#039;m sure he has given a lot of people a great service. I think that the volume he is pushing is seriously messing with his ability to get each order done correctly. Either that or he is a selective scammer, but I will give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />I placed an order a few weeks ago that failed to arrive. This is not my first rodeo. I&#039;ve placed orders on both coasts, as well as international orders, and I have never had an order with a substantial (over10 days) wait or a package not arrive. It just hasn&#039;t happened.<br /><br />NorCalKing claims to be shipping from NorCal. Also where I reside. Initially he told me he it was USPS fault. Really? I can get something coast to coast in days but not within the some state in a week? Tessellatted can ship some awesome acid (and it is awesome) in 5 days from Canada in less time than it can be moved inside the state? Doubtful.<br /><br />We went back and forth a bit with him giving me lame excuses. I asked if he had proof he shipped and he never replied. We are in resolution and not only has he never offered any proof of shipping but he is only willing to provide a 65% refund. I have never placed a smaller order than what I have placed with him so what pisses me off the most is the notion that I would lie about such a small order when I have FE&#039;d much larger orders out of trust for good venders. Based on his reputation I would have FE&#039;d with him but this is just rediculous. There are plenty of great vendors out there for quality bud so I would pick another because this is literally the ONLY vendor I have had an issue with.<br /><br />0/5 Not only would I not order from him again but I would never recommend him to anyone else.

				So now for the rest of the story!<br />We have been experiencing a slowdown in transit times for some . . .&nbsp; not all, but a few of our orders being delivered.&nbsp; Some make it coast to coast in 2-3 days, while most are 3-5 days and a few taking up to &amp; even over 10 days for priority.&nbsp; With first class it&#039;s even slower.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have explained to a number of people this situation which has been a result of &quot;shrinking&quot; pains the postal service has been experiencing lately since they have been downsizing Which has been well documented with all the budget constraints.&nbsp; There are a number of threads in the forums regarding this issue, &amp; a number of people have experienced waiting 10 days or more for their orders, while one waited 3.5 weeks.&nbsp; We have had several orders taking 10-14 days &amp; which has gotten deep into resolution time.&nbsp; So we do try to wait to give it a chance to get there when it is a week or so late.<br /><br />&quot;rhombusbv&quot; asked for a full refund within a week of the order going out, &amp; we wanted to give it time to get there.&nbsp; He gave the explanation that they had just received a card to buy locally, &amp; wanted to peruse that avenue, but it didn&#039;t make sense for us to just cancel their order without giving it plenty of time to get there since the recent screwy transit times, so we told them that we would offer a 65% refund (even though if a package is lost, it is a 50/50 liability).&nbsp; They seemed pissed that we offered only 65% even though all we had to offer was 50%<br /><br />In the end we waited until the last day for resolution to see if it showed, &amp; then gave them the 100%, &amp; we ended up getting a 3/5 feedback for giving them a full refund!&nbsp; Just proves you not everyone can be pleased!<br /><br /><br />NCK<br />
