				Patience is a virtue. Waiting a few days is nothing. Things can go wrong, people can be delayed. Give it a week or two before accusing someone of being a scammer. For example I&#039;ve run into complications with decrypting peoples addresses in pgp and also ran out of baggies, so my samples have been delayed now for a short while.

A lot of scammers open pages to do exchanges and when they build up enough trust/feedback they fuck everyone over lol.<br /><br />Take care

				UPDATE !!!<br /><br />Received a message form Bitcoins there saying he has been busy and that he will give me 10% of my next order and he will respond to my request in 24 hours...<br />I don&#039;t understand why he couldn&#039;t just take the 2 seconds to give me my money rather than sending me a message.<br /><br />I only found out there that one of my good friends Kellyanne (23 years old) was found dead. R.I.P<br /><br />Head is fucked and don&#039;t have any coins in my account to sort it out, I hope he&#039;s not just trying to drag this out to get as much money as he can before he leaves.<br /><br />Going to get some much needed rest and will update in the morning.<br /><br />Take care everyone

				I was in the process of negotiating prices with him when messages became more delayed. I asked about it and he told me he is moving into a new home and needs to set up bank stuff etc. No attempt was made on his side to initiate a deal, on the contrary he informed me that due to these circumstances atm he cant do anything. Also - he informed about the process on his vendor page.

				This shit is a joke. I am seriously thinking about being a BTC vendor. I came here to sample some things but still havent made a purchase because I havent recieved my coins yet. MrBuddha and moneyhoney were the vendors I used. I will make sure whether the transactions are good or ripoff, that the forum is flooded with either good reviews or scammer warnings.

				It&#039;s pretty unlikely that all of these people just coincidentally dropped dead of heart attacks, or decided at random to not leave feedback.<br /><br />Usually when people ask &quot;is this a scam?&quot; the only reason they&#039;re uncertain about it is because they&#039;re the ones who just got taken for a ride...

				update. <br /><br />thanks to all who have stuck up for me here and shame on the ones who doubt me after the feedback and number of trades i have completed. i have been honest and fair sometimes more than fair with all of you and in my hour of need the hole community turns on me. i had had a shit time lately after moving home having internet issues and on thursday last week i had to rush to london after something happened to someone close to me. i left someone to run the account but they where bombarded with 70 orders and even i would have found it hard to keep up and she had an hours training, she was lost and gave up so i raced home to sort this out and may even have to go back again depending on how my friend is when she leaves hospital. but thanks to updates on the site i can employ someone else to help answer messages and check accounts for me. this will reduce my workload and allow me to unpack my things so im not living out of boxes and get my office functional again <br /><br />im sorry im working though the orders and messages now but have 66 orders and 94messages and im only one man.

You then have to take bitcoin fluctuation into account<br /><br />Again, to all concerned people, I would be very much inclined to believe the vendor&#039;s tale, he has integrity and I would imagine he will sort out any non-payments or mistakes<br /><br />

				if you are waiting for an order still message me on site with the title &quot;MY ORDER IS LATE&quot; and i will find it and do it now im down to 55 messages and you need to tell me after you have paid so i can get it checked if you dont tell me you have paid it will be missed. as you can imagine if i answer 50messages i get 50 replies and it takes time to answer them all i am going to have more staff very soon believe me when i say im working on the issues that we have had to deal with over the last week and are putting plans in place so this does not happen again.
