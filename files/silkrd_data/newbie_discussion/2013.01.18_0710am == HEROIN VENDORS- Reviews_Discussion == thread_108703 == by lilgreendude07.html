				While we&#039;re stuck in this &quot;newbie&quot; thread maybe we can still have some productive topics. Here&#039;s a little discussion on the most recent H vendors I&#039;ve used..<br /><br />I&#039;ve always played it safe and ordered from Hatter because I find him to be the most consistent and reliable H vendor. Ordering from him is like clockwork- always receive a potent, ready-to-shoot product 2-3 days later. Even though he says he takes the weekends off he has such a strong work ethic that most of the time he still ships products out on saturdays. His prices are higher than others though but I&#039;ll always pay for convenience.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been trying different vendors though. I just went with Account33 because the reviews on his thread were good as well as his feedback. Well I noticed that after i placed my order he didn&#039;t have his H listings up anymore and the feedback on quality wasn&#039;t that great. Based on what I received, I think he ran out of his dope and used some of his oxys or something to cut it with so that he would be able to fill the last few H orders he had. JUST A GUESS.&nbsp; People went from receiving solid tan chunks of dope that they had to shave with a knife to getting a tan/white powder with a slight pebble or two. When I shot this dope it only lasted two hours tops which reminded me of when I shot oxys back in the day. I only paid $130 + shipping for a half gram and I&#039;m still able to get a rush so whatever.- I feel like I almost got my moneys worth.. I&#039;ll just stick with hatter though. I really don&#039;t mind paying the extra for his product because I like that it&#039;s portable and I could do a shot in about a minute instead of 5.<br /><br />Reviews or discussion on H vendors anyone?

				Haha I think they did- I&#039;m really interested to hear if anyone out there has feedback on account33 because he&#039;s not talked about much..&nbsp; but then again I think he only has like 80 or 90 transactions
