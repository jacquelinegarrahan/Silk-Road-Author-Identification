				Also begs the question, how do you stay off that list. I guess you can&#039;t entirely avoid the risk. But someone could easily pick you at random from a phone book for such a list too. Has this guy really been planning to do this for over six months? The whole thing just seems strange. Maybe some weird LE scare like &#039;oh no stay off the road, we will find out who you are!&#039;, or possibly a competing site &#039;look how insecure SR is!&#039;?

				I&#039;m not sure if LE, if they even saw any of the names, could use it as credible evidence.&nbsp; Not to mention following up on all of the people on the lists would be quite the task.&nbsp; Still, it is a cause for concern.

				Today&#039;s mass posting of buyers details is obviously highly concerning and I would advise anyone using SR to invest a lot of time and energy into fully researching how to use this place as safely as possible. Setting yourself up with safe drop arrangements is a must in order to sever the link between you and the order. How you go about doing this will depend a lot of what country you live in as different countries have different considerations with regards to receiving mail.<br /><br />Opinion is divided on the forums and there are many threads debating the merits of using your real name against a fake name etc. At the very least you should always send your identifiable information encrypted using PGP and as I said make arrangements to put as much distance between you and the delivery address as possible.<br /><br />ssbd

				Assuming the info is genuine, it is most likely purchased from one or more current or former vendors. In a sense I guess that can be a wakeup call. Does every vendor sell his/her customer list? Probably not. But would some vendors do so? Most likely. So picking a vendor who will not save and later sell the customer list is important (or using info that cannot be traced back to you as mentioned above by samesamebutdifferent.) The best would probably be vendors who do not save the info in the first place, then they can&#039;t sell it later. <br /><br />Good vendors who are trying to establish or have established a good business I would think would be the least likely to engage in selling the information. I mean it&#039;s not good for business if your customers are freaked out or busted. But in the long run I think it&#039;s simply not possible to know what vendors might do that.<br /><br />It&#039;s also possible a vendor would fake this information to sell, though that would seem like a lot of work. But depending on how much is being paid for the info it might be worth the time.<br /><br />In any event, such behavior definitely goes against SR&#039;s Code of Conduct: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Our basic rules are to treat others as you would wish to be treated, mind your own business, and don&#039;t do anything to hurt or scam someone else.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				I&#039;ve heard it said to &#039;follow the money&#039;. So my guess is it is most likely a representative from a competing site, with the thought being to rattle confidence in SR&#039;s system/privacy/confidentiality. Thus making the customers listen to the red herring and flee to try to find a &#039;safer&#039; platform. The problem is no such site could possibly be immune to vendors selling the information later, because the vendor ultimately has to know the delivery details in order to ship. There&#039;s another possibility to the source of the info but I don&#039;t want to mention it because I don&#039;t want to give out any ideas.

As long as you go with a reputable high ranked vendor you should be ok. Thousands of us are every day.<br /><br />What whistleblowers is doing is basically trolling. Making inane one line statements without any back up of proof or intelligently argued points/opinions.<br /><br />The mods did their job and whipped down the info asap. <br /><br />The &#039;list&#039; was about 20 names and addresses, mostly Australia. The list was from Oct/Nov 2012 if I recall. For all we know it could be fake but it did look like a dox leak.<br /><br />I really wouldn&#039;t worry about it. Considering the nature of the beast here, I think we&#039;re lucky to have such a well rounded forum relatively free of the dregs of the internet.<br /><br />Do your research, be as secure as you can (PGP, drop addresses etcetc) and go with a good vendor. You&#039;ll be good.

				It&#039;s fear mongering. This person is trying to discredit SR and cause mistrust among the SR users. What&#039;s being implied is that SR is somehow unsecure and cannot be trusted. That is not true. A rogue vendor who is willing to save and sell customer information is the risk.<br /><br />Who would stand to profit the most if SR was gone, or if a lot of users were afraid to use it? I would argue it is the site that many people went to when SR was down for four days a couple weeks back. Probably a site that states they use &quot;advanced encryption services to ensure your purchases and sales are safe and anonymous on our network.&quot; Well that may very well be true, but it still means nothing if the vendor keeps the details and is willing to sell them - that could happen on any site.
