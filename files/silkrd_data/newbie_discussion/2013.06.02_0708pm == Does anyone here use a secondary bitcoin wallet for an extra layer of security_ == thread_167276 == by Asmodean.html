				I&#039;ve read about people using a middleman wallet to buy bitcoins for, from which they then transfer coins to their sr wallets.&nbsp; Does this really add anything more than an illusion of another layer of security?&nbsp; If it is worth it, any suggestions on the most trustworthy/anonymous wallets out there?

				thats what i do, buy my coins transfer to another wallet then to SR. dunno if this is really helping but hey, i&#039;m a paranoid person! buying the coins in the first place is the dodgy bit i recon but even that has to be marginal. still trying to work out the best method for privacy myself

				Yes, I have several wallets running on different machines.&nbsp; My final wallet, the one I use to send to SR, is running over TOR.&nbsp; I send from wherever I buy BTC to my first wallet, then to the wallet running over TOR then to SR.

				I don&#039;t personally send my bitcoins to several different wallets; however, sometimes I pay an extra fee to send my coins through a tumbler. I believe this does virtually the same thing, sending coins through many different destinations until the final is reached, someone please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				I think it depends on when you use the tumbler.&nbsp; My understanding is that SR also uses a tumbler for all its BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you buy your BTC anonymously and send them through a tumbler after the purchase and from the tumbler to your own wallet, they should have been mixed around enough that they cannot be tracked.&nbsp; Then you can transfer it from your wallet (make sure your wallet is running over TOR) to SR, at which point they should be able to associate it with you so long as they don&#039;t have access to your computer.&nbsp; By running your wallet over the TOR network the BTC transaction will never be associated with your actual IP address.

				According to SR it is meant to have a tumbler built in so it shouldn&#039;t really matter but however I do it that way just to be safe.

				Ok,<br /><br />So I&#039;ve not placed any orders yet, just feel I need to know the basics (as in REAL basics) before I do. <br /><br />If I use a tumbler, tored wallet, and so on (as you guys described above), do I really need to buy my bitcoins anonymously? I&#039;ve found what I think is a good domestic (swedish) site for buying bitcoins, and I&#039;m seriously thinkin about buying the BCs with money from my usual internet-bank. Am I completely insane? :/<br />If I use all the methods you guys described, combined with SRs own tumbling (and ordering the package to another address than my own), how safe am I? All they can see is just that I&#039;ve bought BCs, which in itself is completely legit?<br />Or should I find ways to buy it anonymously? If there is no real reason for it, I don&#039;t see why I should go through the trouble <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m newbie-stupid, and if I am I need to know it before I end up doing something stupid ;)

				i use blockchain. it seems to be a very popular wallet and has worked great for all my wheeling and dealings<br />i have never used a tumbler before but i have seen people talking about bitcoin fog. it makes your coins virtually impossible to trace. from what i understand you deposit your coins into a pool of coins and then from there they send your coins to SR. they dont do it all in one transfer, they make multiple random transfers of different amounts at different times. so when the total amount final reaches SR theres no trace of the original coin numbers, its all just random coins from the pool. im sure this service costs money and probably takes a lot longer to get your coins but if you have the time and are worried about security it looks pretty solid<br />always research, read reviews and ask questions about bitcoin services. anyone can set up a website. make sure its legit and peoples are using it successfully before you try it out
