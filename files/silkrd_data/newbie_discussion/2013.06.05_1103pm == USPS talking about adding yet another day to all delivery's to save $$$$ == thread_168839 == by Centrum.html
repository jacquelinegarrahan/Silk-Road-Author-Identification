				I was reading about USPS cause I had heard rumors that this was going to happen. I don&#039;t think its official yet but the wonderful already slow as hell postal service is already talking about adding yet another day to all first class and priority mail delivery&#039;s to save money for their budget.<br /><br />You think they would catch a clue why people are not using USPS like they use to, its to dam slow as it is great.

				Maybe it was old news I can&#039;t remember where I read it but I do remember I didn&#039;t look at the date. Let me see if I can&#039;t dig it up here

				I hope they don&#039;t add another day, since USPS has to have a warrant to search. FedEx and UPS do not need a warrant to search, although customs can open your package to assign any customs dues

				Dam I can&#039;t find it but this is what it said. Express mail not affected and first class I thought it said would&nbsp; be affected. Priority mail 2-3 day shipping cost the postal service a lot of extra money the reason being is the postal service has to in a lot of cause utilize commercial airlines and other air options to get the priority mail to its destination on time. With rising fuel costs this has gotten even more expensive and is would only be used for express delivery a far more expensive rate paid to cover this cost.<br /><br />The postal service could save Billions of dollars by adding an extra day to these delivery&#039;s therefor eliminating the cost and traffic of use of the far more expensive air options which would allow USPS the time needed to use the ground transportation option instead a far cheaper option.<br /><br />Priority mail was definitely the target of it I believe it would slow down first class mail too simply due to increased mail traffic by ground going out the trucks.

				Here&#039;s the problem I don&#039;t think it was old news cause I can&#039;t recall them doing such a thing with priority mail yet which is and was definitely talked about in the article.<br /><br />Nothings written in stone it said they were talking about it.
