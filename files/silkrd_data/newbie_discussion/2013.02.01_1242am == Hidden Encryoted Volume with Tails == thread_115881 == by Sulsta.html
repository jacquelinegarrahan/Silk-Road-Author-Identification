				So, Im wanting to run tails off a Live DVD (I just prefer the idea of a Read Only OS, I know Live USB is prly safe enough, but with a DVD I know data is only being read and cannot ever be written to the OS media). Anyway, the problem with this method is the lack of a persistant volume, so I would have to encrypt a USB drive to store all my pgp keys, some links etc etc. I know this is easy enough to do through tails, however I was really keen to use an encryption method similar to TrueCrypt, where I can actually create a hidden volume inside an outer volume, and in the event shit hits the fan I can give up my outer volume password so LE can access non-SR sensitive info. Dont like the idea of just a single encrypted volume on a USB drive, as that means if I ever had to, Id be left with either refusing to reveal the password, claiming I forgot, or giving them the password to my SR data, all of which Id rather not do, Id rather be able to say, sure, heres my password (knowing theyl only get access to the outer volume). Any ideas if this is possible through tails?<br /><br />Sulsta

				I believe Tails comes with its own internal encryption suite, so it should be possible, yes. <br /><br />The only issue I have with the hidden volume is that if they are REALLY determined to be through, and please correct me if I am wrong, I believe they could actually read the raw data off the disk, and this would let them know that there is a hidden volume.<br /><br />I would just find a damn good hiding place for the flash drive. Or, you could try using an SD card and a USB adapater for it, as an SD card would be even easier to hide than a flash drive. <br /><br />I do not think that is needed if you are just going to be a buyer, having PGP keys is perfectly legal. Although they might be able to take them and say that they are proof of contact, but they would have to prove they were actually used and that they actually are the keys that belong to the vendors they think they belong to. Not sure if that would work in court. <br /><br />As for links, if it is an item/vendor on SR, you can just bookmark/become a fan. If it is non SR, I use OnionBookmark http://x7yxqg5v4j6yzhti.onion/ as it also comes with a nice tag feature that is useful to sort your bookmarks.

				Thanks for the reply, really like your idea about the SD stick into a USB adapter, nice one...and yeh I had that thought too, that theyd be able to know there is a hidden volume regardless of accessing it, but just being able to throw another spanner in the works for any would be Rambo LE officers, while also being able to appear to be cooperating, is the best option imo. Im prly being OVERLY paro about this, but im in the process of doing an entire pc overhaul and getting all new hard drives throughout my pc so that I can start fresh knowing that from now on when Im on SR, theres no chance of any of that touching my everyday computer/hard drives. Thanks for hte input Il have to do some research then it seems.
