				Hey everyone, <br />I&#039;m a relatively new vendor, been here for a little over a month, and I&#039;m just curious what &#039;little things&#039; do you folks on the buyers end appreciate/look for most with your vendors. Tracking numbers? Order updates? I have pretty solid feedback and I&#039;d like to keep it that way. ;)

				Low prices, quality goods, effective stealth, good communications, and prompt shipping are important to most people.&nbsp; We do our best in these categories and are very busy.

				1. Prompt replies to queries<br />2. A well structured vendor page (use titles and sections)<br />3. Don&#039;t list the same product under different names (wertu does this as a marketing ploy and it fucking sucks and stops numerous people from ordering)<br />4. Be honest.

				In addition to the obvious, I really enjoy being able to communicate with my dealer like a human being. It makes me feel less like I&#039;m doing some shady and weird and more like some dude is helping me out (and I&#039;m helping him out with bitcoins as well). Any time I&#039;ve had a special request or question and I get a good response, I become very loyal. Excessive and combative instructions and caveats in the vendors page tends to turn me off as well. I don&#039;t like to feel my vendor has a stick up his ass. Also, if I see a lot of stuff in the comments about fast shipping, I tend to take that as a litmus sign for high quality.<br /><br />What I DON&#039;T consider the utmost importance is price (unless it&#039;s outrageous; there&#039;s a generally a reason one person&#039;s listings are cheap as dirt) and exact rating (since I&#039;ve come back to the silk road vendors are really obsessed with getting 5/5 every single time; it actually makes me suspicious of their reviews in general).

				Stealthy shipping is obviously VERY important.<br /><br />Shipping as quickly as possible after order placement.<br /><br />Good product descriptions/any other relevant information. If the product isn&#039;t top notch, tell us. It&#039;s far better than not saying anything and then letting the buyer down.<br /><br />Prices. This isn&#039;t THAT important to me, as long as stuff isn&#039;t blatantly overpriced. I&#039;ll pick the vendor most appealing to me, and price isn&#039;t the most important factor.<br /><br />Communication. If the buyer contacts you about something, address ALL questions/concerns stated, and don&#039;t make him wait for days for the answer.

				Thanks for all the input everyone! I feel like all vendors, even established ones, could benefit from these pointers. I always try to &#039;over-respond&#039; to questions as quickly as possible but I hadn&#039;t thought to check in after finalization unless there had been a hiccup in the order, or I had any reason to believe that the buyer was unhappy. Regarding the obsession with perfect feedback, I had one customer leave a 4/5 at one point (they said the shrooms weren&#039;t potent, which I thought was odd because all the other feedback I received indicated that they were well above average potency, but hallucinogens affect everyone differently I suppose). That bugged me initially, but I soon realized that I&#039;d get my (100) back with just a few more 5/5 transactions, so I shrugged it off. I did offer them a small 20% refund though. Finally, I&#039;ve noticed that both irl and on the SR, honesty is as valuable as gold, or even bitcoins. I&#039;ve had orders take longer than I had planned due to unforseen obstacles, acts of nature and so on. The few buyers who&#039;ve had to wait an extra day or two have always been completely relaxed about this, partly because I always try to keep them informed about anything that might affect their order, and partly because my custies are awesome as tits! ;)

People seemed a little bit more laid back with ratings. They were content to let their product speak for itself and to let their reputation build naturally, especially around the rumor mill. Now it&#039;s completely changed, of course. I understand the motivation. I don&#039;t hold a grudge. It just used to be nice when ratings actually meant something and the highest rating you ever saw someone have was a 98. 95 generally meant it was good as well, just not the world&#039;s most amazing product and sometimes you chose that person because of speed or cost or whatever.<br /><br />that&#039;s just the way it works, not complaining.
