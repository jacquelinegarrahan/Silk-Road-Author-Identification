				Yesterday I created a account with mt gox in order to to get bit coins when i created my account and tried to log in well for some reason it kept saying that the password that i created not 2minutes before was invalid and that i was locked out for 24 hrs because of to many unsuccessful attempts i guess one is to many well i figured i had made a mistake when creating the account so i decided just to start over i made a new account and it worked with no problems i deposited cash into it with no issues i converted that cash to bit coins with no issues but when i went to transfer said coins i was told that my account had to be validated and that it could take up to 10 business days for said validation so now my only option if i want to make a purchase is to use a different bitcoin vendor and spend yet more money i tried to reason with mt gox but they will not help me they are doing this in my opinion so that they can use my money as a type of zero interest loan that that they can use while they supposedly validate my account dont fall victim of this if you just have to use them make sure your account is validated before giving them a single penny

				You need to be a verified member before you can transfer coins out of your MtGox wallet. To get verified, you have to provide a photo ID and a copy of a utility bill for proof of address. It really sucks and they are not in any way flexible regarding this.<br /><br />I hope you get sorted soon :)

				If it helps your worries about validating an account, bitcoin is used for a lot of other purposes online, so you can always research a reason otherwise to use bitcoin for a scapegoat.. <br /><br />Bitcoin addresses are random too, so its not like theres any connectivity between your mtgox and SR unless they had access to both of your accounts.
