				Well, I am just starting out. But I like to think of myself as a pretty serious person. I learned probably 90% of all the important stuff before I even asked a single question. I just think it&#039;s good manners in a way to not sound like a newb if you don&#039;t have to. Of course now my # of posts reflects that picture for me.&nbsp; Plus everything anyone would ever need to know is well within reach if you just search for it. <br /><br />If you have an opinion, and allow yourself to speak it blindly without the effort that comes with researching it, then you will sail by and I will never notice you.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				this method does take a little longer than the asdfwrge method.... just figured i&#039;d throw that out there :P, while bumping and gaining another post.... im so sneaky....lol, and stoned right now..... might as well throw this out there too.... All Drugs UK(awaiting arrival but extremely courteous and prompt response, definitely a winner) TheDutchGuy, HumboldtsFinest, TheBudFather, Nevita (although we have an unresolved claim), and Awakened350 are all trustworthy, reliable vendors.&nbsp; These vendors cover 90% of illicit substances on the road, and you should check them out before checking other vendors.&nbsp; I&#039;m giving you a free shortcut by doing this.&nbsp; Mention that RoxorsMyBoxors sent you, and you might get an extra (or heavier) product!!!! Can you beat that? :D

				I think you should take advantage of any chance to buy from this site.&nbsp; Savor it.&nbsp; People holding on to their BTC and not spending them is not good for any market.&nbsp; We should be supporting this place as much as possible.&nbsp; We all know all good things come to an end.&nbsp; Or get privatized and turned into an offshore subsidiary.&nbsp;

				Someone gave me -1 and I&#039;m not sure why. I&#039;ve been cool in all my posts. Well I got 25 L from Jerseycow on my first purchase a week ago and they were very clean. Anyone hear theirs a new pope? I thought the last one just sat down a few years ago. Don&#039;t they have to die before theirs a new one.
