				my bigtruck account got hacked and I realized what happened after I traced my steps back through my browser and realized I clicked on the silk road link at the hidden wiki needless to say I typed my login info in and got redirected. little while later when I used my bookmark i couldn&#039;t for the life of me get in and I know my info was correct. I made another account and contacted support asap. they verified the account and changed the pass for me. I&#039;m waiting to change the pin again. they must have changed my forum info because I can&#039;t log in there anymore either. fortunately I got ahold of the btc vendor that I sent 1100 to before they deposited my coins into my bigtruck account. maybe some of this had to do with my poor decision that ended with me losing 600 to daruthless1 when he went scam. I&#039;ve had a rough start and the one thing that matters most my stats are split between two accounts now lol. moral of my story take it slow and double check everything. URL mostly. forums second. info is power in our community. thanks sr <br /><br />kW

				There are several Hidden Wikis out there.&nbsp; What is the address of the Hidden Wiki that you think is leading you to a fake SR?&nbsp; Also, what is the address of the fake SR?&nbsp; Without these details your story won&#039;t help anyone...

				please read before copying this link .I&#039;m not positive but almost sure this is the login site that I typed my info into and got hacked.I apologize if this is some other way into the real silk road but everything I&#039;ve read says if the URL for the road is different than silkroadvb5piz3r then don&#039;t enter and I did !!! if I&#039;m a complete noob and blowing a siren for no reason I apologize! and if that&#039;s the case I have no idea how I got phished.<br /><br />[phishing url removed for caution&#039;s sake]

				The only url you should ever be using is the following legitimate one:&nbsp; silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br /><br />The Hidden Wiki has had that phishing link up for a long, long time, as have other sites as well.<br /><br />(I&#039;m going to edit out the phishing urls from the posts in this thread just to prevent any new members from trying them out, just in case.)

I take advice I&#039;m not an idiot that won&#039;t listen. I def want to be as safe as possible and appreciate any thoughts or advice.
