				I used to use bitinstant because I was a newb and didn&#039;t know any better.&nbsp; I switched over to bitfloor and was very happy with their services.<br /><br />I need a new website/company to use to get by cash deposit --&gt; USD ---&gt; BTC ---&gt; SR account<br /><br />I tried signging up for MTgox this morning but for some reason their shit is fucked up and I can&#039;t sign up for a new account.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can somebody suggest some sites that are trustworthy that I can use?? I liked bitinstant because they were quick and I could use cash + use their services 24/7 ... Bitfloor was great because I could depsosit cash locally, the only problem I had with them was that I had to then go onto their site, trade my USD for BTC THEN transfer them to my SR account... I didn&#039;t bother washing them because all fake names were used etc...<br /><br />Any suggestions will help alot!! I&#039;ve heard about loading up greenpak cards or something like that and using SR vender&#039;s to get BTC on SR?? Can anybody suggest vender&#039;s on here that do this as this is sounding like the best way to go at this point.<br /><br />**I&#039;m trying to deposit funds so I can place an order today!! Please help!!**<br /><br />-Bill Paxton (Florida!!!)

				Hi,<br />I used localbitcoins.com or bitcoinlocal.com or someting like that to find someone to deal with PERSONALLY. Now I have gotten to know him, he is waaaay more accessible and waaay cheaper then using those services that ripped me off and left me swinging too many times. It&#039;s like Craigslist, and as always, with any of this..be careful<br />hope this helps<br />~PB2k
