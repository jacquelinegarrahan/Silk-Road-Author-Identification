				This is a thread for those of us relegated to the newbie section. It&#039;s purpose is to give the most up-to-date reviews of vendors on the road to aid you in making the right choice. <br /><br />Reviews may be for any drug purchased on the road.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MDMA~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Quick version:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />~XTCEXPRESS~: STAY AWAY. Lied about shipping, never arrived, 50% refund. Many other bad reviews. (Serotonin Swell)<br /><br />~HollyMolly~: STAY AWAY. Plauged by lack of communication, package MIA. Requested refund on 100g purchase, received &quot;99%&quot; refund, was actually 58%. (Serotonin Swell)<br /><br />~Dutchtrade~: Recommended. Promising up and comer with fantastic bulk prices. 2 successful orders, 1 bulk. (Serotonin Swell)<br /><br />~Sukey~: Recommended. Good communication, solid review. (BlackFlash)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Detailed version:<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />~~XTCEXPRESS~~: *0.2* (third and last order placed.)<br />Date&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Placed Feb, Resolved April<br />Purchaser Serotonin Swell<br />Price&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7/10&nbsp; (100 grams)<br />Quality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0/10&nbsp; (Product never arrived)<br />Stealth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0/10&nbsp; (If they actually shipped it, then obviously very bad) <br />Shipping&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0/10 (Product never arrived)<br />Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5/10 (under $1500, 100% reship, over $1500 30-50% refund)<br />Communication&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0/10&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Overall the experience with XTCEXPRESS was terrible. We placed the order on Feb 8th. Product was marked in transit on the 10th. On March 4th, after two extensions, they let us know they were delayed and they were shipping the package then. A few weeks and extensions later we asked for a refund. They then became hostile and insulting, refusing to give us a refund, citing their policy of 50% which we agreed to. We responded their policy was mute because they lied about shipping which violated SR&#039;s policies. After a month of trying to get a refund it went to resolution, where we were awarded 50%. We feel cheated by XTCEXPRESS AND the silk road staff. We absolutely will not be doing business with them again and post this as a word of caution to anyone who may be considering them. (Note: XTCEXPRESS admitted they marked the package in transit 22 days before shipping. This was not considered reason enough to refund our purchase by SR staff.)<br /><br />~~XTCEXPRESS~~: *7.6-8.3* (two orders for 60g placed 2 months apart. Score is an aggregate of both orders)<br />Price&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7/10&nbsp; (60 grams)<br />Quality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8/10&nbsp; (Rolling hard off 160-200 mg, depending on the user.)<br />Stealth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/10&nbsp; (Very good if the package is not opened. If opened, well, we&#039;ll see you on the flip side) <br />Shipping&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8/10 (19 days total for first order, 10! days for second, to S.E. U.S)<br />Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5-9/10 (under $1500, 100% reship, over $1500 30-50% refund)<br />Communication&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9/10&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Overall very satisfied with the experience. Prices are quite high (edit: prices more competitive after some vendors are no longer selling) for bulk ordering, and policy is lacking, but made up for with communication and quality.<br />Special note: This was our first purchase, and XTCEXPRESS was willing to work with and trust us for a 60g purchase after a few messages, and did not require FE.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />~~DUTCHTRADE~~ *9.0* (100 grams)<br />Date&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Late March<br />Purchaser&nbsp; &nbsp;Serotonin Swell<br />Price&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/10&nbsp; &nbsp;(100 grams, bulk prices fantastic)<br />Quality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/10&nbsp; (Rolling hard off 150 mg, depending on the user.)<br />Stealth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8/10&nbsp; (Stealth needs improvement for larger packages, but still acceptable) <br />Shipping&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/10 ( 11 days to S.E. U.S, track and trace)<br />Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7/10 (No FE, 50% refund)<br />Communication&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/10&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We ordered via track and trace, and were notified within 18 hours our package was sent. We did opt for track and sign. Product is absolutely phenomenal. 85% giant rocks (one of them was 19grams!) and 15% chunky powder. Tested perfectly with the three wisemen and several oral testers. The vendor has since suspended operations to work on stealth, and we can&#039;t wait to see what it looks like. <br /><br />~~DUTCHTRADE~~ *9.16* (first order of 10)<br />Date&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mid march<br />Purchaser&nbsp; &nbsp;Serotonin Swell<br />Price&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/10&nbsp; (10 grams, bulk prices fantastic)<br />Quality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/10&nbsp; (Rolling hard off 150 mg, depending on the user.)<br />Stealth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10/10&nbsp; (Wonderful stealth, multiple techniques employed, very safe) <br />Shipping&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/10 ( 9 days to S.E. U.S)<br />Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7/10 (No FE, 50% refund)<br />Communication&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9/10&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Working with Dutchtrade has been wonderful so far. Package arrived 6 days after ordering. The product was received with a mix of moderately crushed powder and some sizable rocks for the amount ordered, and looks absolutely beautiful. Tested perfectly with the three wise-men. One of us came out of retirement to test personally, and this is their review. <br /><br />&quot;After seeing the order from Dutchtrade, I decided to personally test it. I popped 150mg at 12:23, after eating a large meal and 2 shots of vodka. The comeup was slow and relaxed, which I believe was partly due to a full stomach and alcohol. At 1:13 I boosted with another 150mg, and by 1:40 realized I didn&#039;t need to. Euphoric waves of empathy and love coursed through me as I listened to the DJ with my girlfriend. We walked around making friends with new people all night, some of which I gave samples to. Those who received samples reported back as early as 40 minutes from dosing saying they couldn&#039;t believe how clean it was. Peaked around 2:30 with heavy eye wiggles, strong body high, and a feeling of connectedness with everything and everyone around me. About this time I met up with Lucy, and by 3:20 was still going strong with Dutch&#039;s goods as well as mild OEV and moderate CEV. Around 4:50 I began to experience waves in and out, and everything felt as though it was exactly as it should be. Arrived at the house around 5:30 and have fun with the girlfriend until 7:30. Went to sleep without any problems, and woke up sore but with a nice afterglow. Dutch&#039;s goods were on par with some of the best, and definitely the cleanest, I&#039;ve ever had and would recommend again.&quot; We have already purchased an additional 100g from Dutch, which shipped less than 18 hours after purchase. <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />~~HOLLYMOLLY ~~*2.5* (100 grams)<br />Date&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;early/mid March<br />Purchaser&nbsp; &nbsp;Serotonin Swell<br />Price&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8/10&nbsp; (100 grams currently in processing)<br />Quality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; */10 <br />Stealth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; */10 <br />Shipping&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0/10 (Still waiting, Just under 3 weeks since marked in transit, waited 6 days to be marked)<br />Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7-10/10 (50%AUS/USA, 100%everywhere else)<br />Communication&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0/10&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Placed an order with HOLLYMOLLY for a custom order. Took 6 days to be marked in transit, has been just under 3 weeks since shipped. Two extensions given in RC, with no reply from vendor. Will update once resolved. <br />Update: still no word after 2 additional extensions. Have requested a refund from the vendor. If they fail to respond we will be seeking a refund from the SR staff. Updated stats. Update: received &quot;99%&quot; refund from SR staff, was actually given 58%. Believe vendor is pretending to ship packages, letting the resolution last as long as possible, and raking the difference. <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />~~SUKEY~~: *8.83*1 order 1 gram mdma<br />Date&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;March?<br />Purchaser&nbsp; &nbsp;blackflash8686<br />Price&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7/10&nbsp; (1 gram, original reviewer marked 10/10, CHANGED TO REFLECT THREAD PRICE RANGE)<br />Quality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/10&nbsp; (clean and powerful could last longer)<br />Stealth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9/10&nbsp; (only becasue no mbb but perfect for US)<br />Shipping&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/10 (5 days from EU to US)<br />Policy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8/10 (SEE PROFILE PAGE VERY FAIR!)<br />Communication&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10/10&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />very nice to deal with. answered all my questions. was my first successful pruchase!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />****************REVIEWERS!****************:<br />Please use the following format for MDMA.

				Over Memorial day weekend i ordered 1gram of Coke from Sukey 1gram of Coke from from Bungee54 and 5gram of MDMA from Jesus of Rave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bungee: 1 gram of Puruvian<br />&nbsp; 10/10 Price - It was pricey,&nbsp; but compared to what i pay locally for quantity/quality it was worth it.<br />&nbsp; 10/10 quality.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a coke expert.&nbsp; I did like how clean Bungee54&#039;s was over Sukey&#039;s though.<br />&nbsp; 10/10 stealth. (Undetectable in my book. Only issue is the zip lock stuck to MBB i didn&#039;t lose anything though, but it took me 20min to open it.)<br />&nbsp; 10/10 shipping.&nbsp; (4 business days to east coast US)<br /><br /><br />Sukey: 1 gram of ultraclean<br />&nbsp; 10/10 Price - Price between Sukey and Bungee was comparable after shipping.<br />&nbsp; 10/10 quality.&nbsp; I Liked Bungee&#039;s slighly better due to it&#039;s cleaner taste. but again I&#039;m no expert.<br />&nbsp; 9/10 stealth. (No MBB, but other than that it was A+)<br />&nbsp; 10/10 shipping.&nbsp; (4 business days to east coast)<br /><br /><br />JoR: 5 gram MDMA<br />&nbsp; 10/10 Price - I can&#039;t complain about the price of any of the MDMA on SR.<br />&nbsp; 0/0 Quality - Just got it today.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update after i Test and try it.&nbsp; I have a test kit as well so I&#039;ll post results.<br />&nbsp; 9/10 shipping. I ordered all three products on the same day and same time.&nbsp; Jor&#039;s took 3 business days longer to arrive. <br />&nbsp; 10/10 Stealth - Perfect stealth. ZipLock did stick to MBB Glue but only on the edges of the bag.
