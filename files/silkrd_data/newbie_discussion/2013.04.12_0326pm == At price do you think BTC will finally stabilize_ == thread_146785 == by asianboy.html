				nobody can answer that with any confidence.&nbsp; <br /><br />personally, i think its interesting that prices haven&#039;t fallen further than they have.&nbsp; &nbsp;today&#039;s volume is off the charts, so i will wait a few more days before converting any cash to btc&#039;s.

				I think it is near impossible to say. It depends on the exchanges getting their act together, specifically mtgox. It depends on the confidence in the currency. I think there is going to always be some demand for bitcoin. Whether or not it gets a foothold as a real form of investment , that has yet to be seen. The day before the crash I saw gloating posts on how bitcoin was on it&#039;s way to 2-3k/coin. Is that possible, maybe, is it likely in the current configuration of the market, no.<br /><br />source: sr newb

				$45 then up to 75 back to 50 and will trade within that range. However with europe as a catalyst any major news could send it skyrocketing again
