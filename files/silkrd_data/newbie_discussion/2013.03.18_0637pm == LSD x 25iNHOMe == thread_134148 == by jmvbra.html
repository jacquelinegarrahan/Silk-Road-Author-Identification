				What is difference between them?<br />The difference between them is only worth?<br /><br />I live in a place that does not have good drugs, many people sell-25i-NHOMe name as LSD.<br /><br />Many people reported that 25iNHOMe harms health, is this true?<br /><br />Can someone give me more information?

				25i has a much lower (read: it reasonably exists) LD50 when compared to LSD, as for specifics in trip differences, it would take someone experienced at both to accurately explain it.

				Look I consume hoffman, biking (100,200,1000 years), chiva eye, and some other blotters for some time (6 years)<br />Bad&#039;m sure the drugs are not in my locality as the quality of the SR.

				In my opinion there are many differences in these two drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />first off LSD - I have taken on 8 or 9 occasions<br />LSD has no taste or very slight taste and has a very clean come up even at higher doses say 3 tabs<br />LSD left me very social in every situation and feeling very euphoric every time as i felt i would never have it possible to have a bad trip<br />and the next day of LSD seems to not be bad at all<br /><br />NBOME CHEMICALS have taken 30 or 40 times 25i 2 times taken 25 C<br /><br />took tabs of this first time 550 tabs only took one and continued to take more and more all summer since i got over 1000 the most i took once was 8 tabs so about 4.5 mg but i had a VERY high tollerance and would never reccomend someone to take more than 1mg for their first time, anyway that being said at 1mg or less levels the come up is fairly strong but not bad only when i took 2mg with no tolerance was i almost overwellmed with the come up and threw up took probably 50 of these tabs all summer and never felt sick untill i threw up one time off of them and then now everytime i take them i puke probably all in my head, anyway the only thing i would say about this drug is that the VASOCONSTRICTION is severe at times of high doses and can cause some people to freak out.&nbsp; i have also never had a bad trip on 25i NBOME but have witnessed inexperienced ppl have bad trips at mg over 1 dose<br /><br />all in all i would say LSD is the way to go but nbome is a fun thing to try <br /><br />on the note of long term effects i have noticed nothing out of the ordinary of my normal health and me and 5 of my closest buddies took probably 50 a piece of these over the course of 3 months and to not have any effects after seems rediculous but its true i feel completly fine. i will note that after taking 2.5 mg of 25i after not taking it for a month i tripped harder than ever and felt like i tripped for almost 24 hours<br />it was a great trip tho and some of the strongest visuals i have ever seen such vivid colors and moving patterns sat in a park from 10 at night till 9 in the morning saying hi to all the sunday morning walkers still tripped out in a circle with my two best buddies some crazy dude asked me about some pelecans and shit it was fucked up lol anyway happy trials<br /><br />
