				Having waited over a week for my account to be verified to buy BTC in the first place, I also found I had to wait around again while they validated an account to withdraw euros to. THEN, I&#039;m waiting a week since taking the euro from MtGox and it still hasn&#039;t shown up in my bank account. A friend tells me he had to wait three weeks before he had his money in the bank!<br /><br />Not that I really care, but it&#039;s hard to see how Bitcoin will ever be taken even semi-seriously as a currency when this is the carry on of the broker of 80% of all trades (if we are to believe their publicity).

				They did this to me too. I messaged their support center and they messaged me back with some BS response. I messaged them again asking WHY, WHY, WHY. They don&#039;t answer the questions because there&#039;s no answer to it besides they are fucking retarded. They just want you to verify so you will use their business more. I for one am going to verify, withdraw, and completely delete my account and never look back. Mtgox has extremely poor customer service and their common sense isn&#039;t much better. They want to make more money at the cost of their customers, their already making more money than they know what to do with. <br /><br />Also, the second response I got from &quot;the help desk&quot; was a copy and pasted message and him saying We have already told you while your account is pending review and you need to submit these forms to this email etc etc (because it was under suspicion it was hacked or compromised) and then he goes on to say &quot;There hasn&#039;t been any other foreign IP&#039;s that have logged onto your account&quot; &quot;Please go to our site and try to log-in&quot;<br /><br />I swear they are so stupid they don&#039;t even know how their own company works. Some gook just got lucky as hell and started up an exchange site with the early adopters. For 1, you can&#039;t even make a support ticket unless you&#039;re logged into your account, and secondly, I never said my account was hacked or anything else was hacked, and I had never messaged them about anything ever. So to say my account &quot;Was under suspicion that it had been compromised or hacked&quot; is completely fucking retarded, they even said themselves that there was no other IP&#039;s that had logged onto the account besides. I shouldn&#039;t of expected anymore from some stupid gooks over in Japan. I&#039;m not racist but this is the shit that makes me want to be, you don&#039;t run an English or Foreign Language speaking site if you can&#039;t even understand the fucking language. They either can&#039;t speak the language right or they are so dumb they can&#039;t even make up a decent excuse as to why my account needs to be verified when all I did was create it, deposit Bitcoins, sell them, and try to withdraw. Completely fucking useless.<br /><br />I have already missed 5+ deadline for payments because of these idiots. They never said anywhere I would have to weeks to verify my account and be able to withdraw the funds, until it showed up as a pop-up message when I got everything set up and clicked withdraw. Apparently they must not know ho to read English either or else they&#039;d make that pretty apparent, because it&#039;s a pretty fucking big step.

				I guess you all missed my point...<br /><br />&quot;Mt Gox is a great bitcoin exchange but they now unfortunately flag anyone accessing their site through Tor.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br /><br />maybe you visited mtgox over your local library as mentioned in this thread or found out another way of staying anon. <br />

				&quot;Hello,<br /><br />Thank you for the email. This has been already outlined in the TOS. In response to an increased incidence of phishing and hacking attempts made against Mt.Gox and its users, stricter security precautions have been implemented to protect our users and their funds. Should suspicious activity be detected in relation to an Mt.Gox account, the ability to withdraw funds will be temporarily suspended until it can be confirmed that the owner of the account is in fact still in control.<br /><br />Should your account be affected by these security measures, please send two (2) pieces of identification documentation to aml@mtgox.com.<br /><br />Thank you for the email. On checking further with the account we can see that there is no foreign IP matches. Please note that you will not be able to login with any TOR browser or through any proxy as these are prohibited. Can you please try to login normally and let me know if you face any issue.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />The exact quote by quote message I got from their help desk. They completely contradict themselves. Ridiculous and it&#039;s also extremely poor customer service.<br />
