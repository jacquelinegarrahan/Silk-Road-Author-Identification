				Hi, I&#039;m new around here and I decided to try a free sample from someone on SR. The listing cost 44 cents in bitcoins. I used that to make the order and had a few cents left over, like 4 cents. The order got canceled. It said I received a refund. I didn&#039;t notice any change in my wallet size. I messaged them about this and they said the order was canceled and I got my refund. I waited a day and a half to make sure it wasn&#039;t just taking time to send it back. I wish they could check their logs or something because it clearly didn&#039;t refund. I wonder if they &quot;can&quot; check logs like balance changes and such. Anyhoo. I still had the 4 cents in my account. That&#039;s all. 0.0004 bitcoins. 4 cents. Should be,...&quot;0.0044&quot;. I&#039;m not gonna complain any further since the amount is so small but it makes me feel a little less trusting of the system. What if I actually used like 100 dollars in bitcoins and never got it back? Has this happened to anyone else or reports about this happening to anyone else?

				SR still takes its fee even when the order is cancelled. So that&#039;s probably where your money went.

				How much is the fee for? Doesn&#039;t seem to make sense? Are you sure? In that case the fee would be 100% since I got nothing in return.

				Ok I found the problem here. It is because my order was, &quot;Hedged&quot; This means I got the same dollar value back as the item I tried to buy. I think the item was listed as nothing and the shipping cost 44 cents, thus I got back nothing in return. How sad.

				Does anyone actually know if SR does actually apply a transaction fee? I&#039;ve never heard about it.
