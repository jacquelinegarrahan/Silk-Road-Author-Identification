				Hi, I appreciate this might very well not be for the road but it seemed a good place to start asking. Basically, I live in the UK, where the buying of pyro for football - smoke bombs, flares etc (nothing particularly dangerous) - is severely restricted. This is not to mention the restriction on them at football grounds where possession of one will get you a large ban, fine and possibly a prison sentence. Even if you get away with it at the ground, and this is the key, they can track who&#039;s bought them online from the typical online stores where you register you card details or paypal or whatever.<br /><br />Having used Silk Road for a while, and being part of the growing &#039;Against Modern Football&#039; movement in england, I thought that possibly it could be used to bypass this. I know a lot of people on SR are from Europe, where flares and smoke bombs are easily available, and that if you could put a few up I would be eternally grateful. Certainly you could find a relatively large market in England for them.<br /><br />This stuff is completely non-violent and is far less dangerous than some of the drugs on SR, but I appreciate if they are considered as similar to weapons and are not allowed.<br /><br />Any input as to where else these kind of things could be found on the deep web would also be useful.<br /><br />Thanks!
