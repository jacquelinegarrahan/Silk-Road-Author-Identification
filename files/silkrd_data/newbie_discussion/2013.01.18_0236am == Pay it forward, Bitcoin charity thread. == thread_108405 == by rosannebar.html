				For the newbie section, spare change type thread.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Need some bitcoins/ leave some bitcoins. <br /><br />I am thinking a pay it forward type, donate,&nbsp; help others type thing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So if your a few bit&#039;s short,&nbsp; or have some spare change left over in your wallet here is a good place to ask or spread the love.

				Yeah I think they have one of these thats like 50+ pages in the big boy forums.<br /><br />I need 0.24BTC if anyone would be so kind as to donate. Obviously I cant pay it forward at this very second as I am short myself. :/ But I will in 7-10 days.

				I see now that there is a spare coins thread,&nbsp; not sure how to delete this one i just made, but maybe it won&#039;t hurt to leave it up anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have this thing in mind, how you send in one bit coin and someone else sends in one bit coin and then it grows and grows and finally someone is given all the donated coins.&nbsp; &nbsp; Know what I mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; Like when it reaches say 50 or 100btc, then one of the people that donated will win all of them.&nbsp; &nbsp; I think that sounds like an awesome thing.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just not 100% sure on how to go about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know there are lotteries with vendors but what about a forum type lotto?&nbsp; &nbsp; Thoughts?

				Hello!<br /><br />I happen to be 0.14 BTC short on a very exciting buy, and my Dwolla transaction isn&#039;t supposed to go through until the 5th of march. I was wondering if anyone is feeling exceptionally generous. I&#039;m willing to either pay it forward, or pay you back 2 fold. <br /><br />-Cheers!<br /><br />wallet address: 1KMyMDyb2bT9pMrpj9JKTkY7E5mD17DVW1
