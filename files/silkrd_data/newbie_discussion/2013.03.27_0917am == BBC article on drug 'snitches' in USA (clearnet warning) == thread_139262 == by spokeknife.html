				http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21939453<br /><br />A sad &amp; depressing story about how law &#039;enforcement&#039; works in the United States, with regards to drugs, plea bargaining, and informing.<br /><br />The worst part of it is the tactic that individuals are pushed into, where they actually have to encourage more criminality, so they can get a lighter sentence.<br /><br />It&#039;s like some horrible never ending game of one upmanship. If you&#039;re not ruthless enough to snare five other people apart from yourself, then you go to jail for a massive amount of time.

				I don&#039;t even want to read the articule... The reality is almost unbelievable, really.&nbsp; That&#039;s why there&#039;s such a large community around SR: because people in pain who use chemicals shouldn&#039;t be punished with even more pain.&nbsp; They should be helped, not thrown away as the scum of society.&nbsp; And they are basically thrown away; convicted felons in America don&#039;t have it easy finding jobs, after all.

				It is absurd that people get punished for choosing to consume something of their own choice.<br />If I use MDMA / Amphetamine once every month or so, apparently I have a drug problem and would get a criminal record.<br /><br />Yet I can drink a bottle of spirits every day and never encounter any legal problems and be treated as a more respectable person than a drug user.<br /><br />I know somebody who is an alcoholic and drinks 20+ drinks every day. They see no problem with this because it is legal. But when I told them about my occasional drug use, they think I am a drug addict and a criminal because I choose to do so. other than drug use, I have a full time job and don&#039;t commit any other crimes. I hate how in this day in age, drug users are treated poorly and it doesn&#039;t make any sense that drugs are illegal.

				Couldn&#039;t agree more with the replies thus far. It really pisses me off that my choice to enjoy my body and mind with drugs could ruin all my hard work to get what I have in life. Drugs policies are illogical and making more problems than they solve. It&#039;s completely wrong that scientific evidence is willingly brushed under the rug for the self-interest of bureaucrats. Jarvis Cocker is right. Cunts are still running the world.

				It just strikes me as a ludicrous system, actually encouraging more crime than preventing it.<br /><br />It is the opposite of what &#039;policing&#039; a community should be.

				The so called war on drugs is a joke. All it does is create violence and a stigma around drug use that causes more kids to want to use drugs. Legalization would stop most of the crime. If they spent a fraction of what they do prosecuting people on treatment this wouldn&#039;t be a problem.

				The world turned fascist while people weren&#039;t looking.<br /><br />People drank alcohol for years and nobody but the religious nuts gave two concentric fucks. But people found better drugs, like MDMA and LSD, the simple minded masses fear anything new and exciting, and the modern response to something that causes fear is legislation.<br /><br />Simple minded fools don&#039;t like other people experiencing something they&#039;re to afraid to try.<br /><br />Now people can have people punished for doing nothing wrong while maintaining the illusion of having the moral high-ground.<br /><br />To me this is just like Nazi Germany, where a climate of fear was created and neighbours would report each other for the slightest crime. Listening to jazz music caused nobody any harm, but it could land you in Dachau because those in power decided that it was degenerate.<br /><br /><br />Apologies if this post is inane drivle, somebody is completely stoned(And harming absoloutly nobody in the process)
