				Not posting on my real account. I&#039;ve spent time in American prisons. Don&#039;t know if you want to know anything about that. I don&#039;t know how similar Aussie prison is to American prison.

				Yeah mate Id like to hear your experience please. Aussie prisons are considered much easier to those in the states from the research Ive done but its still good to learn the rules. Im sure they are similar

				Fucken heavy man. Sorry to hear it. Did they get any intel about SR from you or was it purely a case of getting caught with a bit more gear than you were meant to have.<br /><br />Best of luck mate.a 12 month sentence will reduce a lot and you will be paroled quicker. Hopefully you end up on a farm.

				Don&#039;t accept anything from anyone. Be weary of anyone being nice to you, especially if they are offering you something. You will have to pay it back with a high tax or pay it back with some type of favor that you do not want to do, possibly sexual favors. Gambling often leads to trouble. Try hard to blend in with everyone and don&#039;t stand out. The guards will mess with you if you stand out. The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. It&#039;s better to get your ass beat than to pussy out from a fight. If you pussy out then you will be known as a bitch to the whole compound. Word spreads fast. If you are a bitch or you let someone take advantage of you, everyone will do the same thing and take advantage of you. All kindness will be taken as weakness. If you share something with someone, they will be back for more constantly. That includes food and non-food items. Don&#039;t make eye contact with other inmates unless you are in a conversation with them. That is a very easy way to get in a fight. You will hear lies all day, every day. Every inmate thinks they are right and will argue with you even though they are wrong. I can&#039;t think of anything else.

Neither are fun but I personally would take 2 years in an Aussie jail over 18 months in a US one.<br /><br />Not speaking from personal experience I should add, but do know people who have done time in both places.<br /><br />If you end up in medium or low security (idk the offence) in Aus that can be fairly easy time. If there is such a thing.

				Thanks for all the replies guys.<br /><br />Was doing some sales IRL and one of the blokes I sold to was dealing and got done by the pigs and snitched on me. Next thing Im getting raided at 4am. Between his evidence and a little bit of coke they found (they missed the majority) my lawyer says 12 months with my guilty plea. With it being my first offence and not violence related there is a good chance I will end up on a prison farm after I get classified. I know a few blokes that have done time but in Aus its kind of not the done thing to ask about their time.<br /><br />&nbsp;The detectives put it on me hard to give up my supplier or anyone I could finger for that matter. Gave me all sorts of bull shit promises. They could have told me I would have walked and I still wouldnt give up a single person. When I got into this game I had a code I would never give anyone up if I got caught. <br /><br />I made 2 mistakes. Dealing with someone I didnt know very well. I should have never dealt with anyone but the few people in the game Id known since childhood and trusted with my life. I also had drugs where I slept. Had that coke been at another premises they would have had nothing on me. Basically I got complacent

				surely all they can do you for is possession? it&#039;s his word against yours and if you had nothing but a bit of coke then it would look like he was trying to stitch you up or have I missed something?

				To worm, you are exactly he type that would roll over and give up your mates to prevent doing time because your post tells me you know you would become a punk inside. <br /><br />The small amount of coke I described is actually a bit of an understatement and by the laws in my state is enough to be deemed supply not personal. Plus they found cash and scales/baggies. You sell drugs in Aus you go to prison its pretty simple. With any luck I will serve just 6 of the 12 months thats expected to be handed down. Im not complaining, shit for everything Ive got away with I should be looking at a 10year stretch.<br /><br />All i was after was advice on how to conduct myself inside to best avoid problems and make my time as easy as possible. Thanks to the few people that gave some solid advice. Any Aussies wish to chime in please do. Feel free to PM if you like.<br /><br />Thanks again guys&nbsp; :)

				I can&#039;t really offer any advice about actual prison because I&#039;ve never been done that way. I got raided due to a couple of people I knew informing on me. One was this guy who was a former major mdma cook in brisbane and the other was this crazy russian woman who I got far too infatuated with. They showed up expecting to find meth and weed in reasonable quantities (maybe an 8ball and an ounce) as the second informer, the crazy bitch, was told by me of what I intended though she swears black and blue that she told nobody. I don&#039;t believe her. I would have saved myself a lot of trouble forgetting about her but you know how it is when you get a thing for someone.<br /><br />Anyway, they raided me, and I didn&#039;t actually have any drugs, but I had a bunch of poor-man&#039;s labware, a 12 pack of demazin tablets, about a gram of red phos and a little hand pipe I&#039;d forgotten about. I coughed the stuff straight up for them, and they made a big song and dance about how &#039;dangerous&#039; all that labware and tiny amounts of a common chemical found on products in most households was. ZOMG TURPS ZOMG SHELLITE ZOMG HYDROCHLORIC ACID. oh yeah, cunts stole my computer, that I&#039;d literally just the day before got a pair of 320gb HDDs for (so they were still unformatted) and a nice set of triple-beam 20mg accurate scales. anyway, I said in court that I was cooking it up for myself and that I had ADD and a sleep disorder, I showed them the diagnostics for both, fully legit, and I got off with 18 months probation.<br /><br />It still totally sucked ass. I spent far too much of that 18 months drinking like a fish and too nervous to even buy a stick off a long time trusted friend. <br /><br />I absolutely hate how vicious and callous detectives are. You really are better off being very careful about what you admit to. I only rolled over so extensively because I was staying with my mother at the time and I didn&#039;t want them busting holes in walls and that sort of nonsense, or turning the place upside down. If I&#039;d been living by myself I&#039;d have just sat back in the couch and said &#039;well you&#039;re gonna do it anyway, i don&#039;t see why i should help you&#039;. they say that they will be &#039;nicer&#039; to you if you cough up, but that&#039;s bullshit, and only applies a little bit when you are a first time &#039;offender&#039;.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope things go ok for you. I think that all things considered unless you have priors 12 months jail is unlikely, especially if you are younger. I would think that the sentence will be more like 6 months with a year suspended or maybe even just a 12 month suspended or 18 month probation. I was in queensland at the time, and those pigs are extra vicious, so if I was able to get off that lightly on a petty manufacturing charge, I&#039;d say for a petty dealing charge you should be able to do about the same, if you are smart and don&#039;t believe a word they say to you either in the interview room or in the courtroom. good luck!
