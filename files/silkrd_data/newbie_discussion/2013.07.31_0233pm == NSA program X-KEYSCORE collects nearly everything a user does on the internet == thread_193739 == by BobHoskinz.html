				Assume that everything we do here is stored, so it&#039;s better to use encryption for sensitive things.<br /><br />Our privacy is in real danger, we must do anything we can to retain as much as we can of it and <br /><br />that is why I&#039;m learning as much as I can about security and how to protect myself and be safe on SR.

It basically means that you can browse darknet services, such as SR, through your regular web browser like Google Chrome. It&#039;s done by adding &quot;.to&quot; after the onion address like so:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/<br /><br />However, when doing this, you negate all the encryption that Tor provides, and thus make yourself much more susceptible to things like this X-KEYSCORE.

				I agree, thank you for responding with such kindly informativeness. I thankfully had not heard of such plugin, nor would I have thought it wise to use it. I installed the tor browser bundle on a virtual machine, but I&#039;m always worried there&#039;s one thing I&#039;m doing wrong that everyone else knows about that will make my tor browsing not anonymous. This may be a weird spot for this question, but am I supposed to configure the tor settings myself for browsing a site like this, or is it automatically configured optimally and I should leave the default settings? I&#039;m talking about on the vidalia control panel. Any input would be appreciated.

				Found this interesting<br /><br />&quot;Under US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a &#039;US person&#039;, though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets.&quot;<br /><br />Wonder how they define foreign targets? What if a Tor exit node is outside the U.S. ?&nbsp; Could they be herding people to use Tor under the guise of &quot;Anonymity so that they can store and/or read our communications?&nbsp; Ergo, how anonymous is Tor really?

				Remember kids, tunneling your proxies and VPNs is fun!<br /><br />I connect to an anonymous VPN [commercial, paid for in anon BTC] before even using the TOR browser.&nbsp; That way my ISP doesn&#039;t even know I&#039;m on TOR, or what IPs I&#039;m connecting to.&nbsp; Sometimes I rent a VPS [paid in BTC] in another country and run my traffic through that right under the first VPN.<br /><br />Anyone else have some super secret squirrel tactics?<br /><br />Mr uP.
