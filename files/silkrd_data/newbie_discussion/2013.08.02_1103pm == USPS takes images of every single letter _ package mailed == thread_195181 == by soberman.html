				Don&#039;t know if anybody else has seen this. I&#039;m a new user but figured I might be of some assistance to those on SR who have not been made aware of this yet. According to the article, there is no central database with all the images USPS takes. Rather, the images are saved at each of the 200 distribution facilities in the US. The article also states that this is not so much a LEO operation as it is a USPS operation that assists in directing and routing the mail. I have copied the link below for your perusal:<br /><br />http://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-usps-takes-photos-mail-072949079.html<br /><br />Any thoughts? Was anybody aware before this AP interview that such a program existed? And if they have the capability of &quot;bunching&quot; or grouping letters / packages by dropbox and marking them all as such, does this mean if they find one package a seller mailed out on a certain day, they could also identify all the other packages that the seller may have mailed out that day? What, if any, changes in behavior should buyers and sellers make now that news of this program has surfaced?

				It has been one revelation after another, over the last few years, how the world is under surveillance by out of control spy op orgs, but the sobering fact, soberman, is this kind of shit has been going on for a long long time. It is basically an internal coup of America by a few entrenched aggrandizers that has finally seen the light of day. George Carlin kept telling us it was a done deal, it was already too late, ya know??&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; &nbsp; Also notice our citizens are docile sheep and lemmings. All of these overreaching spy programs, and no second American revolution yet?? Ron Paul got shut out, they were very afraid of him because he was going to spoil their two party criminal syndicate.<br /><br />Yeah, soberman, there has been a decades-long program of postal surveillance, I read about this latest jaw dropping effort by our government to spy on its own innocent citizens, and was once again disgusted, another mental flare of dry heaves due to an excess of perverted surveillance overkill. Yeah, the program expanded and now they have images of everything that is processed, but they simply don&#039;t have the resources to analyze this information and act on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a few threads about packaging elsewhere in this forum and several postal employees posted replies that the USPS is way understaffed, inefficient, and incompetent, with some funny ancedotal examples, including the memorable quote that they just let obvious small amounts go through unless it is &quot;pounds of weed or coke&quot;. It costs too much&nbsp; to become a federal case unless it is a BIG bust.&nbsp; They admitted that it&#039;s too much to stop, and it keeps growing. <br /><br />But, despite everything I just said, it is always better to play it safe and reduce the odds for all of us. We are here together, and we are only as weak as our weakest link. With experience you will see that by following a few simple rules and precautions you are making it highly unlikely of ever having a problem with deliveries. My experience confirms this approach works. The biggest risk for the buyer is grossly incompetent stealth by the provider.<br /><br />I guess with a counter intuitive name like &quot;soberman&quot; you really are on the Down Low, LEO will never suspect you are up to anything intoxicating, will they?............. LOL. yuk!!&nbsp; ;D ::) ;) :D

				<br />hey sativanist,<br /><br />well, that&#039;s comforting. i&#039;m glad to hear they don&#039;t go after the weekend warriors too much. and yeah, i hear you about the continually increasing monitorization of the people. i always knew and suspected as much but i don&#039;t understand how something like this goes on for so long with people not knowing. like, how does not even a low-level employee spill it to the media? for months or years!<br /><br />myfriendhasamoped,<br /><br />sorry, but at the time i posted this it was breaking news and there were no other posts on it in the newbie forum... ? i&#039;m a newbie and i posted in this forum. maybe you saw the posts in other forums?<br /><br />-soberman<br />
