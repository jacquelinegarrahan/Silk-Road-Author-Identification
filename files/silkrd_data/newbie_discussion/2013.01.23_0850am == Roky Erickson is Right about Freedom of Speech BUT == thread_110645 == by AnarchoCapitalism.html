				I was reading the jokes he posted yesterday and they were terrible and very offensive I completely agree, I had to stop reading them after reading a few BUT I did not hate the guy for posting and expressing himself I just decided to stop reading and go read something else and found it a little amusing he had the balls to post all that up. I did not think to myself gee I should censor him...although it did make me wonder if he has done any of the things I just had read and did not like the possibility at all but when you open the door to censorship you start closing the door to truth and it leads to a bad place. Communists/dictators are who censor things, is this the kind of country you want? All laws usually start off with just regulating one or two things and then with time that only multiplies more and more (government always seeks to expand its own power). Our media simply reports what they are told to report by corporations protected by the government that basically own the government......Rich corporations and Central Bankers are who are running things.<br /><br /><br />But if someone says something that you dont like you have the right to speak your mind too and shame them or ignore them as to not reinforce what you consider negative behavior. You have the right to express it bothers you too and express your anger.

				I agree that freedom of speech is part of the revolution laid out here at Silk Road.<br />Ok let me make this clear I&#039;ve not censored him personally, never the less he was put on a freedom of speech that i dont have to read list.<br />He is just causing problems because that&#039;s all he knows how to do and his hate rhetoric is just an easy way out to get his attention. <br />He is screaming how butthurt the moderators are but he appears to be the one butthurt. I say this because he wont shut up about it.<br />He&#039;s not added anything of use to the forum since his 1st post...it&#039;s very likely the spamming posts in this section will be stopped very soon.<br />If he cant show to be a contributing member of the community than he is a destroying member.<br />We dont really need negative member spouting off misinformation and misdirection for private agendas here. Which is to cause thrive between the new mods and the Staff admins.<br /><br /><br />X)<br />nomad

The point is that freedom of speech is not negotiable, you are born with that right. However, ofcourse spammers should be stopped bc spamming is not freedom of speech is more like harassing someone so I don&#039;t see them in the same category. One thing is posting offensive jokes that are titled as offensive jokes and another is constantly bugging people with junk messages over and over again.

				When you start censoring people and by that I dont mean stop spamming I am all for that, then you open the door for more and more things getting censored and for censoring to become more and more normalized.

				Pure freedom of speech entails no limits.&nbsp; Many people want freedom for what they wish to speak but are adamant that limits be placed on others. To avoid speech being controlled by the powers that be, totally free speech must be tolerated.&nbsp; It will be offensive and hateful at times but that is the price that is paid for freedom.&nbsp; Users of the Silk Road should be especially attuned to issues authoritarian control.
