				Hey I&#039;m not new to Silk Road but new to buying, I&#039;ve recently made my first purchase and even though the issue is getting handled due to a fantastic vendor with excellent service I still have some questions for general vendors and buyers out there. I&#039;m trying to figure out why I&#039;ve received this notice twice. I and the vendor were able to confirm that the address was recognized. I used my real named formatted my address exactly as it should have been, yet I still got the undeliverable as addressed notice. There wasn&#039;t even an attempt at delivery, it basically showed up at my post office and 30 minutes later it was shown as undeliverable. I called the post office and USPS customer service and of course there&#039;s nothing they can do about it. I was just wondering what can be done to to minimize this from happening. As I plan on becoming a long term buyer, but there has to be more reliable shipping for me to invest a lot of money. Thanks for your time and responses in advance!<br /><br />ElectroBossMan

				That&#039;s what it sounds like to me because it&#039;s not a common problem. I received a package from the U.K that was handwritten and made it just fine. So something happened with the label. I guess it looks like there&#039;s nothing you can do but hope the vendor secures that scan label so it will go through hmph....&nbsp; :-\

				Good idea I&#039;ve thought about that as a test. We&#039;ll see if this reship goes well as the only think in the address that could&#039;ve been a problem was me not using my middle initial, even though UPS doesn&#039;t require it. I basically copied and pasted my address exactly from USPS using all caps. There&#039;s also the possibility of an incompetent temp postal worker due to it being around the holiday season. Wish me luck!
