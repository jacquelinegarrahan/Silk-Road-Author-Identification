				Guess no one gets on here with android to spend bitcoins with the vendors I would think that the community would be willing to help people get closer to spending bitcoins by relaying how to do pgp on android!!!

				Im almost certain you wont get an answer, because A). I doubt you can properly use pgp on a mobile device.<br /><br />More importantly, B) making any kind of transaction on SR through any mobile device is highly advised against.

				You can use an app called &quot;APG&quot;. Available on the android market.<br /><br />Save pasted keys into a text file, then save in *.asc format and import from within the app. <br /><br />Also, use Orbot with Opera mobile.<br />Enable the correct proxy settings, disable JavaScript, and root your handset so Orbot can push all traffic through the onion network.

				True, Orbot with Opera is great. Make sure to disable all plugins. As for PGP. I had a 6-month back and forth PGP only communication with a third-party and neither of us knew who the other was, despite good deals going on. Once it&#039;s all public email and networks, the PGP content is just garbage to those trying to work it out. Of course, the two parties had a trusted customer supplier relationship at that point. But it is a viable option.

				thanks for all the information!! <br /><br />shouldnt we be able to use pgp on mobile devices? since are wallets are on mobie devices and wwe are to use that to purchase in the real world right?<br /><br />why not purchase from a mobile device on SR seems to be safer than connected statically at home, use wifi anywhere and make purchases?<br />

				I dont remember the technicals of it, but a wel known tech head member had explained this to me once before, something about the mobiles devices not being able to be totally anonymous. That they can some how or another always be traced or something to that effect. <br /><br />As always, I could be wrong, im certainly no genius regarding these matters.

				I should start an underground computer hardware and tech store... <br /><br />Yes, as pointed out, APG with K9 is the way to go. Browse the clearnet and there are plenty of bits of info to help you set it up.<br /><br />Build your android phone to a similar spec to the US gov - IE: Route as much as your signal through a encrypted VPN as possible. Droidwall etc.<br /><br />Your carrier will be able to see that you are using a certain type of connection to a certain place... But bugger all else.<br /><br />Alternatively, there is much wisdom in forsaking the &quot;smarts&quot; of a smartphone anyway. A lot can be hidden in the open if all parties are on the same page.
