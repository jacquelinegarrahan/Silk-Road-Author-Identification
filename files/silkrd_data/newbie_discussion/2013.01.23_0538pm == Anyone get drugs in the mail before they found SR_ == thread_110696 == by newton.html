				My homie&nbsp; moved to Cali in the 90&#039;s, and has been shipping to us ever since. Pounds of the best outdoor for 2500, indoor for 3500. I always bought the outdoor, since most of the year it was a little fluffy, but just as good potency wise. Once I got an ounce of molly, but it was right when he started to pick up a habit, so the quality was off. That sale started a mess, and the next time I bought some outdoor, it took two weeks to get it out, and he sent me a picked through hash bag. I told him what he sent was disrespectful, he started having his brother come around to lean on me for the money. I showed his bro the score, and he made the drive to see what was up out there. Turns out he picked himself up an oxy habit. When I started to look for other options to land some smoke, I found out about the private networks. Started with freenet, but all I found was kiddie diddlers. <br /><br />So, have any of you had outside experience with mailing drugs? It fucks me up to see the shipping section, everything we did is recommended to not be done. Express, next day, poly bags, ten lb&#039;s in a box....

				I never tried to order shit through the mail. I had a homie that used to get bud Dutch buds sent to the US from overseas from some random website. I don&#039;t count ordering mushroom spores as drugs really, as it&#039;s legal, and they&#039;re for microscopy use only, but I had ordered spores before. I had sent weed to family members through the mail successfully for years, but never more than an ounce. I would personally never order weed or hash through the mail though, too many mail men around where I live smoke the kindness:) After I had ordered some shit from ENBOOM and loved it, I tried to order some grams of 25I-NBOMe from some fucking Chinese based places online, but never had any luck, just got ripped off a few hundred bucks:( I would still like some good websites to order raw RC powders from if anybody wants to PM some links to me:) I quit trying to find other sites after I got ripped off a couple of times. The escrow system that SR uses really became quite appealing to me after that:) Also, totally agree with empty banana1 on that last post.

				We used to send joints in letters sometimes. <br /><br />In college, we would order bags of MDMA from a student at another college where they were making it in the Chemistry department lab! They would send it by FedDex. Of course, this was in the 1980s and at the time the stuff wasn&#039;t yet illegal.

				Only posti g weed to myself from Amsterdam. 5 years ago a dvd case with about 15 loose baggies of weed made it back. Inside a folded paper bag inside a slim non-airtight cardboard box may I add. I ran home on my dinner every day to check and fuck me the day it arrived I knew the second I opened the door. Despite that package being below amateur and making it the next year I deduced what I thought was a flawless method of sleath and alls I received was a customs letter inviting me to contact them if I thought they might have &#039;something&#039; i believed was mine. <br /><br />Domestic all the way.

				Many times ..and I;m glad you asked cause I have a good story - a perfect storm if you will<br /><br />Had a pound of weed shipped to a safe address. The guy at the safe address gave me a former tenants name to use. The shipper used USPS and we learned a tragic lesson about mail forwarding.

				Also, yes. I once had a half zip of opium shipped to me from a guy I&#039;d never met. A friend hooked up that deal for me and promised to help me beat the shit out of him if I got ripped off. I gave this friend my address to give to the guy along with the code to a Moneypack card. Within an hour my friend told me that the guy had told him the card was empty. This was strange to me, as I had just handed $400 to the Walmart clerk, and the transaction was suppose to be instantaneous. <br />The next morning I got up early and biked over my local copy store where I could fax the necessary information to Moneypack. I got on the phone with a lady at some noisy Indian call center who told me they had not received the fax and to please try again. I tried over and over, talked to multiple employees, went through the verification procedures so many times I eventually memorized most of my information, argued with several people about whose fax machine was at fault (in the end a manager admitted to me that their fax machines had in fact been down for days, though why this is something the others felt they had to lie to about was beyond me) at one point I actually cried a little bit. <br />This lasted three hours. I watched the sun rise through the store&#039;s large window. Eventually the aforementioned manager informed me that I could actually email the info I was trying to get through. I had been told several times by others that this was not a possibility. The emails fucked up. The manager all but hung up on me. Finally I got through to a sympathetic man. I still remember his name. It was Mani. Wherever you are, Mani, I will always love you. I don&#039;t know what he did, but whatever it was took like 30 seconds. Boom. Done. The $400 were back in my account within 15 minutes the package had shipped. <br />Never. Again.

				I&#039;ve used Budmail a couple of times, ingenious packaging but the buds always came pre-ground. To the uk anyway. <br />Less than stellar customer service. The term &quot;helpdesk&quot; is almost ironic. <br />Such a faff for payment. Liberty reserve only.<br /><br />Also used BMR once, mixed results. Only bought weed, but it was really ropey and underweight.<br /><br />Much happier here. Done a lot of research and it seems to be more secure, easier payment, more choice and better prices. This is the way to do it methinks.<br />Looking forward to my first shipment.

				Pre 9/11 we would bring weed in from Mexico into Texas and then ship it back home. I think we lost only 2 shipments of 75 pound boxes. Then we switched to hydro. A lot safer and easier.

				Used to buy RC&#039;s (mostly mephedrone, but had some 2ce/2ci, methylone etc.) from a genuine website. Was extremely high quality stuff too. When the website shut down we were pretty distraught. 2 years later though, we found out about SR and things are back to normal (or what I consider normal).

				I&#039;ve been doing drugs through the mail for quite a long time before I discovered SR. I have friends all over the place with better bulk connections than I can get in my shitty location. Dabbled quite extensively with the RC scene too but not so much anymore. Too many tweaks imo.

				Yes, received multiple elbows of bud from california for years, shipped back east some myself when I spent some time out there. Never had an issue personally, but I do know friends who&#039;ve had packages nabbed of bud and cash, and have heard of a controlled delivery or two for pounds. I have also heard that ten pounds is the magic number that DEA will follow up on with cannabis.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Damn, I forgot about this thread. Fucking spam always throws off the normal flow of a forum.<br /><br />Seems like most ordered RC&#039;s, are any of the companies still around. I would love to order some jwh&#039;s again, worked real well for traveling. You can mix it with a solvent put it on paper, write something on the paper, and then eat it later. I also soaked a few cigars in the past, it worked like a charm. I would rather smoke the realness, but sometimes on vacation, when you fly, you can&#039;t take just anything with you. In the past I would&#039;ve stuffed it up my ass, but after 9-11 I&#039;m afraid that they&#039;ll see it in the scan. Like &quot;hey, what are those balloons doing in your rectum?&quot; I can&#039;t see me going all gangsta towards TSA with wife and kids in tow. I haven&#039;t taught the yung&#039;uns you shoot yet.

				Actually, yes!<br />Back in 2010/2011 I used to be into RCs hardcore. My favorite was MDPV (which is probably my fav. drug of all time, interestingly enough).&nbsp; :o<br />I had a site I used quite frequently. I never had any problems, and I often ordered larger amounts. The quality was excellent, and so was the service!<br />Looking back- I wasn&#039;t careful with it AT ALL. Nothing was encrypted. I used my personal email, name, home address...ect.<br />I didn&#039;t know better. Fortunately everything went smoothing every time!
