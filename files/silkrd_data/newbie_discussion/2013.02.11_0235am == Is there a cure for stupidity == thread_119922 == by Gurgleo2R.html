				I linked back to SR from a link on Hidden Wiki last night and put my user name and PW in.&nbsp; Once I entered the verify and pressed enter another box opened up and asked for my PIN.&nbsp; This is where I knew I truly screwed up and have been unable to access my account.&nbsp; Is there any way to access the funds in my wallet since I still have the PIN number?&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to pay BCs for answer that works.&nbsp; Email is Alshuto76@tormail.org.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				Honestly mate I think you&#039;re fucked.&nbsp; But to be sure we&#039;re going to need more steps as to exactly what you did.&nbsp; Can you 1-4 it?&nbsp; I&#039;m a little lost on exactly how/what you&#039;re claiming.

				If i&#039;m guessing correctly your saying that you entered your username and password on a phishing site, and now some one has your username and password, Right? If thats the case i suggest you message the silkroad moderators. they cant spend your bitcoins without your pin and it takes a couple days to change pins

				So what would they be able to do with email and pass without pin?&nbsp; Can you change account with that info?&nbsp; It would seem that to be smart the system would require you to input pin in order to change email/pass right?
