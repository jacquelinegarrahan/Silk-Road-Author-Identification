				Hi there,<br /><br />So I am thinking of becoming a vendor on SR to sell domestic only (european country that have like 10 items up atm....).<br />My english sucks and so does my brains thinking, hehe. Hence the reason for this thread.....<br /><br />I just can&#039;t understand the fee structure for SR vendors. Please help.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150 (on top of 10% of the first $50)<br />6% of $150 - 300 (on top of 10% of the first $50 and 8.5% of the next $100)<br />3% of $300 - 500 (etc)<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />This structure is designed so that commission doesn&#039;t drop sharply when moving up a bracket, as from $50 to $51.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />??????????<br /><br />What exactly does the above mean? Please explain the fee structure for me folks.<br />Give a ----&gt;few examples&lt;---- etc. Please please please!! And use the simpliest english possible. I really need your help guys. <br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />anon

				I&#039;m not a seller or anything, but the way I interpret it, you&#039;d calculate it something like this:<br /><br />Say you sold $2,000 worth of drugs. You&#039;d figure it out like this:<br /><br />50 * 0.1 = 5<br />150 * 0.085 = 12.75<br />300 * 0.06 = 18<br />500 * 0.03 = 15<br />1,000 * 0.02 = 20<br /><br />so for your first thousand dollars you owe 5+12.75+18+15+20= $70.75<br /><br />Anything beyond that is %1.5. So we said we made 2,000 so we have 1,000 left to be charged for. 0.015 * 1,000 = 15<br /><br />So for a 2,000 dollar sale period you owe $85.75.<br /><br />If you made $9,623, instead of multiplying 0.015 with 1,000 you&#039;d go with 8,623 giving you&nbsp; 129.345+70.75 (for the first thousand) giving you a total fee of $200.095.<br /><br />If this is true, this seems like an extremely cheap billing system.

				Okay, let me try again, because I want to.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you were charged something simpler. The rate could be something like you get charged 2% for the first thousand you sell and 1% for all subsequent stuff you sell. If you sold $5,000 you would be charged 2% for your first $1,000 (which comes to $20). Then you would be charge 1% for the next $4,000 (4,000 because you were already charged with your first 1,000). That comes to $40.<br /><br />So, if you sold $5,000 in drugs, you&#039;d owe $20 for your first grand and $40 for you subsequent 4 grand. 20 + 40 = 60. Thus, for selling $5,000 you will be charged $60.<br /><br />Do you get that at least?

				I think it&#039;s simpler than that but maybe I&#039;m wrong.<br /><br />Simple idea:<br /><br />If your order is between 0 and $50: 10% fee<br />...between $50 and $150: 8.5% fee<br />...between $150 and $300: 6% fee<br />...and so on.<br /><br />Complicated idea:<br /><br />This shit is cumulative. So, 10% of first $50, 8.5% of next $100, 6% of next $150, and so on - all add up together to form a fee.

				Either all of you are too high, or i am too high. My head hurt after reading all this. <br />Its very simple!<br /><br />Whatever listing you have, it has a set fee for it. The fee is automatically in the price. <br /><br />So if you have something that is $10 for sale, sr makes 10% so they make $1. SO, to the public it shows as&nbsp; $11. <br />So if you have something that is $1000 for sale, sr makes %1.5 so they make $15, SO to the public it shows as $1015 <br /><br />Kinda get it now?? <br /><br />You get whatever money you want for your items, sr fees are just on top. <br />
