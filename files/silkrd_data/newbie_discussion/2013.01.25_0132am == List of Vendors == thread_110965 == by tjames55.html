				Hi all, my first post is not surprisingly a question.<br />Is it possible to get a list of all vendors on SR?<br />It would be great if it was also possible to filter the list according to region and also maybe product.<br /><br />Thanks, TJames

				I don&#039;t mean to be &quot;that guy&quot; but on the actual SR website you can see all the vendors that currently have products listed filtered by substance or region and sorted by best selling, newest or seller rank.

				You can pretty much do that on your own, and you&#039;ll be better off and have a better sense of which vendors sound like someone you&#039;d like to deal with by investigating this for your self , by reading their vending profile pages on SR -&nbsp; listed by checking out the different products you are interested in obtaining. also by checking out the stuff written here in the forums by both vendors and buyers. Coming up with your own list really doesn&#039;t take much time at all, and it can always be added to by your own set of criteria.

				I&#039;ll reply to your first post with a first post of my own. <br />My thoughts are a) such a list would be so long it wouldn&#039;t really be all that helpful b) because new vendors appear all the time and old ones occasionally drop out for weeks, months or all time, such a list would be difficult to maintain and c) part of the fun of SR is getting to know the site and the vendors who populate it, that a list would not only ruin this &quot;fun&quot; but perhaps be counterproductive, if not downright dangerous. Look at the the accusations that get leveled at the LSD Avengers list. They may be few and far between, but a list that attempts to describe the whole site would be a far messier situation (assuming that you&#039;re looking for more than just a list of names, which doesn&#039;t seem worth the time it would take as far as I&#039;m concerned). To the best of my knowledge, no such list exists.

				Yeah I 100% agree with neurot. Just become a fan of all of your favorite most reputable, personable, and reliable vendors then its like you have your own team to root for! You pretty much only need one really good vendor favorite&#039;d for each of your drugs of choice...unless you&#039;re into LSD...no vendor has ever been able to satisfy the need for lsd on the road so it&#039;s best to have all of the avengers star vendors (and maybe ok vendors at your discretion) to choose between. I have personally read every post my favorite vendors have made on the forums to make sure they&#039;ve had good vibes since the beginning. Good luck finding your team!
