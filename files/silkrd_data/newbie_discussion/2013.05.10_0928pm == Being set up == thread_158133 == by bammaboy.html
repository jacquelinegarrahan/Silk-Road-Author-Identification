				I got a package today. It has a lot of weed and some blotters in it. It isn&#039;t mine. It has my name and address on it. I think someone is trying to set me up. Will I get in trouble even though I didn&#039;t order it?

				Free weed and LSD? Sounds like Xmas has come early. I say enjoy it. lol.<br /><br />Has a vendor sent you two packages by mistake?<br />Have you forgotten you ordered something?<br />Check your purchase history on SR and see if you&#039;ve actually bought something or not.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d flush the packaging and use it or stash it for awhile ASAP to be careful. Seems like a vendor you ordered from before saved your address, even though he shouldn&#039;t have, then mixed orders and now you got free shit. I honestly don&#039;t think the LE would let you go that long.

LE wouldn&#039;t let you sit with a package. If it was a controled delivery they&#039;d be bashing your door down almost immediately after it was delivered. <br /><br />It&#039;s far more likely that a vendor has cocked up and sent you someone else&#039;s order, which could be worrying in itself. Means they still have your address.<br />OR you&#039;ve ordered something and forgotten about it. <br /><br />

				I&#039;d say if they smoke all the herb and take all the sid then everything will be out of the ordinary. They did say blotters though. Could be RC&#039;s.

				Here&#039;s what to do.<br /><br />Take 5 hits of the acid and smoke that pot, and sit at your table or whatever with a machine gun next to you. If the cops smash in your door, you&#039;ll have just enough time to pick up the machine gun and mow down as many of them as you can before they blast you into the next world.<br /><br />Death is the greatest orgasm.

				Years ago someone sent me some E&#039;s in the mail. I was well shocked. Had no idea where they came from and if they were any good, but they turned out to be excellent. Someone I traded tapes with &quot;owned up&quot; a few months later.
