				Hello,<br /><br />well i want to know if someone doing this and what do you guys think of this method, how efficient you think it is . . . i understand some might consider it paranoia and some would assume it is excessive but this is how i do it :<br /><br />for surfing the dark net in general and specifically after indulging into SR, i started using three things to do as safe as i could based on researching,<br /><br />i use a VPN program &quot; IPVanish &quot; to mask my wireless connection, and open a regular browser &quot; FireFox &quot; and it shows a different IP address other than my country IP address ( i use this browser as a decoyed lol - not sure how technically accurate this is), then i open Tor with vidalia and Tor browser to surf SR which show also a different IP address other than the one showing in the FireFox, and from there i know you could mask your Mac address &quot; MAC spoofing &quot; but i tend to replace my NIC &quot; wireless card &quot; or &quot; Airport Card &quot; to change the hard address of my computer/laptop/desktop, depends on what machine am using to keep the laptop/desktop free of traces . . . <br /><br />also formatting the laptop/desktop completely based on DoD standards, every week give or take . . . and thats how i keep myself away from any leads to me . . . <br /><br />any one else doing this ... or what do you guys think of it, i would love to know what are the vulnerability of this method, or the weakness which i could improve . . . <br /><br />do you guys think that my ISP could still watch over my shoulder and trace things to me !?<br /><br />it would be interesting to find out other ways used by expert SR surfers . . .&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I use tor with a VPN for ultimate protection. I&#039;m a newbie though so I am sure there are more things to use to decoy, such as tails..etc

				well, <br /><br />i must say that i still need to do more research on tails, and i think the best practice is using tail from a USB in internet coffee through a public computer. <br /><br />i just insist on the fact that one must master the use of his own computer with the optm. privacy practices no matter what.

				Yes practice makes perfect and in the world of SR there is always things to learn, I see people with 800-1k posts on here still learning and inquiriing about things. These forums/SR has a plethora of information, waiting to be soaked in by us all!!

				As far as Im aware tails deals with wiping any traces so you dont need to wipe your pc, I think its related to not having a persistent volume, which is why every time u boot tails you have to put in a new password.

				I think i should start using Tails and PGP, sounds like the best and the safest combination . . .

				It&#039;s because in regular Firefox you&#039;re seeing the public IP the VPN is using to route your requests to the Internet. When you use the Tor browser, you&#039;re seeing the IP address of your Tor exit node.
