				Hi,<br /><br />Since you seem to need 50 posts to write in the other parts of this forum and I really wanted to post this feedback, I&#039;m gonna make it here.<br />I found silkroad and started researching vendors to make my first order, I found KittenHuffer. It seemed like he was friends with a more experienced vendor called FartBomber and that FB recommended him, he was also throwing some extras to the orders so I messaged him hoping he could help me doing my order in the best way possible.<br /><br />Fast forward to today and I couldn&#039;t be more satisfied, he had a lot of patience with me and answered messages in a record time (something i really appreciated).<br />I ordered 10 gandalfs (142 ug) and received on strawberry for free (99 ug) for free. They came separated with one work day temporally separating them. I&#039;m on the EU btw.<br />I can&#039;t really tell very much about the stealth but even I had some difficulties trying to find the product inside the letters.<br />I can&#039;t wait to try them and, from what I&#039;ve been reading in his reviews i&#039;m expecting a great, clean and powerful trip<br />Oh and the price was very competitive too.<br /><br />5/5 will order again.<br /><br />Good tripping,<br />Kombi321<br />

				as I said before in terms of quality is seems like he had really good reviews (strong and clean) and one guy in the feedback topic said that the strawberries seemed like they were over 99 ug.<br />But yeah ofc, will update when I try them (probably a week or two)

				I loved the last lot of strawberries I got from KittenHuffer and I&#039;ve now got another ten on the way.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait :)<br /><br />I had some 150ug trips (twins) from another vendor last week and I didn&#039;t trip anywhere near as hard as I did with the strawberries.&nbsp; The visuals from the strawberries were amazing considering they&#039;re only 99ug.&nbsp; Price is fantastic too.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll probably just buy all my acid from KittenHuffer now.
