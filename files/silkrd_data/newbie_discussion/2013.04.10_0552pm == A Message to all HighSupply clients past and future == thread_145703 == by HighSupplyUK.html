				Hey Guys!<br />We rarely ever complain about our day to day business and we do not like to drag any of customers names on to the forums even though we have received some real whacky messages over the last few months but there is one thing, without naming any names, we would appreciate our buyers do not do.<br />Twice now we have had messages asking about our stealth and exact details of what and how we will ship- this is fair enough except that these are not buyers worried about customs, they do not want their parents to open up there letter full of beans!<br />This is quite disconcerting as IRL we would refuse to sell to children full stop but here everyone is anonymous; if you are a kid, feel free to buy from us but please dont message us saying things like &quot;I have told my mum i&#039;m waiting on a new CD coming in because she sometimes opens up letters for me if im at school and she CANNOT find out I buy drugs. She would kill me so can you please send your letter in a small brown envelope with my name on it with the beans inside a CD so my mum will believe my story?&quot;<br />Firstly. No can we fuck. We are now very experienced with stealth and will ship with whatever means is safest. Not what your mother will expect in the mail and secondly who&#039;s name do you think we will put on iit? Your Ross, ah damnit we were going to address it to your dad Dave. WTF?<br />Anyways other than that all you guys are awesome, sorry for the delays the last few days, twice now the road has been down for maintenance just as we are preparing the days orders but dont worry, we always make sure everyone gets what they want and will not rest until they do.<br />We are very proud of our business and reading all your great feedback about us gives a great feeling of pride that just does not happen IRL- at first we were not sure about Silk Road&nbsp; but now we are, we like it and we are going to stay!<br />-HS-
