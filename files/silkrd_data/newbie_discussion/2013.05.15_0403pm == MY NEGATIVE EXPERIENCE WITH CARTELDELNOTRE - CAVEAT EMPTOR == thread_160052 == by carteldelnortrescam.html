				DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR. <br /><br />My order did not arrive and the Vendor ignores all requests for tracking information.&nbsp; There are comments in their feedback from other customers getting the same treatment.&nbsp; This &quot;Vendor&quot; has taken their listing down because they are &quot;BUSY&quot; with lots of orders.&nbsp; There are plenty of SR Vendors that treat Customers with respect - I suggest using one of them instead of this scammer.<br />&nbsp;<br />DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR.<br /><br />Below is a copy of the PMs sent trying to get this Vendor to give me tracking information.<br /><br />2 Days - cartel del norte(100)<br />sorry but have been insanely busy with orders and have not had the time to check messages recently. my sincere apologies. i will check your trcking from the office and see why it has not arrived and provide you a copy as well. if there is a problem, rest assured, its guaranteed and we reship fully at our expense. gracias!<br /><br />3 Days - Me<br />- The parcel you allegedly sent me still has not arrived.<br />- I requested tracking information after seven days (domestic) and you did not reply the following day as promised.<br />- You have not read the PM I sent two days after you failed to give me tracking information and I sent that PM three days ago.<br />- Your Vendor page indicates that you have been on SR every day for the duration of this nonsense.<br />Here is how we proceed. The money means nothing to me and I will not lower myself to dealing with you through the resolution process to recover it. Reply to me by Monday afternoon or I will finalize the order, rate you accordingly and heavily advertize your shoddy treatment on the forums (post to 50 anyone?).<br /><br />5 days&nbsp; - Me<br />Can you tell me where my parcel is?
