				Being new to SR at the time and wanting to make a small purchase to start with, I went with blueberry91 for mdma. Overall, a smooth transaction. Since it was a small amount (2 x 200mg caps) my bf and I had a cap each and decided to plug half and eat half. We are both experienced users and this was definitely a fun night for us just at home. I am a 120 lb girl and he&#039;s about 160 lbs and he felt the effects before I did. But I have been known to have an oddly high tolerance even though I wait months between usage. So we started with the plugged half, waited about an hour and ate/snorted the rest. About an hour and a half in, the effects were really good. Not speedy or anything and music sounded great. Definitely had the lovey euphoric feeling and we had some intense conversations. Only regret I have is charging through more beers than water haha. We dropped the first dose at midnight and I was passed out fast asleep by 5am. For the small amount that it was, it was definitely pretty good quality. Perfect for a night in with a significant other, which was our intended use all along. If it were being used at a festy or show, I would definitely have wanted more.
