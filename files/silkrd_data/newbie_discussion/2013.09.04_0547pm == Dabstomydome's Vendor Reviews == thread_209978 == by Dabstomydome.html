				Hey guys<br />Had some spare time this morning so i thought id make a thread on experiences ive had with vendors on SR. ive been a member for 4 or so months and gone through about 15 vendors-some great, some horrible. since id hate to see other good people on here experience the bad vendors, ill give you guys some forewarning, and let you know what vendors ive had good experiences with. I will try to do it in chronological order from when i first ordered.<br /><br />420connections- ive ordered from him about three or four times now. he has some of the cheapest wax on SR. it usually is a darker brown in color, a thick waxy consistency, and average taste/smell. his wax has a tendency to sizzle a little and not be purged all the way, but for the price he is pretty good if you only have 30 bucks and want a g or if you are trying to get a good deal for resale in bigger amounts.<br /><br />sallyb- best edibles vendor i have gone through. ive ordered her suckers a few times and every time she got the order to me super quick(2-3 days). she has the quickest shipping of any vendor on sr and her suckers not only taste good, but get you stoned. some of the edibles on SR are pretty weak and i can say that hers def pack a punch.<br /><br />just4u2nv- ordered 3 grams of some candy kush wax. it was very tasty and although not the strongest wax ive smoked, some of the best purged and best smelling wax ive ever encountered. i would reccomend him for tasty kinds of wax.<br /><br />thetopshelf- this fucking faggot jacked me $450, along with many other people. i thank the topshelf for teaching me not to ever FE!!<br /><br />bankobits- he is my go to guy for getting less than 300 dollars of coins. all you have to do is western union him your money, and he will have it for you within the day. really trustful guy and someone i would reccomend for newbies to get their coins from.<br /><br />felidae- got a gram of his blue magoo shatter for 17 bucks! it was one of the best deals i have got on here. it wasnt shatter but that could have been from all the heat on its way to the midwest. his wax is purged well and he seems to be a very good vendor.<br /><br />thefunguy- bought a 1/8 of strawberry cough cuz i needed some flame for a camping trip. he went out of his way to get me the herb in 3 days before i left, seems like a very nice guy. His herb is decent but not super kill.<br /><br />shakedownstreet- bought a half g of molly from him. it was decent but nothing special.<br /><br />bizarro- he has the best stealth of any vendors on silk road. it really impressed me. he gave me some white question marks that were amazing but also some mdma that was cheap, but not very good. maybe stick to the pills with this vendor and you will be happy.<br /><br />vincent45vega- got a little three pill combo from him for 25 bucks of two rolls and a 2CB. The roll didnt make me roll and the 2CB just made shit even wierder, but maybe its just me not liking the drug. He has rolls for very cheap if you are looking for resale, but not the best quality.<br /><br />qualitykings- got a bunch of edibles from him. its pretty cool to be able to get all these cool dispensary edibles since i live in a non medical state and would normally never come across anything like that. when i showed all my friends my medicated pop rocks and pixi stix, everyone couldnt believe they even made something like that. quick shipping, nice vendor that i would recommend for good edibles.<br /><br />bestpricepills- got a gram of girl scout cookies from him as a sample. ive always wanted to try gsc and was super pumped when i finally got the chance. although his cookies are very expensive compared to other herbs on SR, you get what you pay for and he has some of the best herb no doubt!<br /><br />retinablast-got a vial of tincture from him. the shipping was kind of slow but everything else was good besides that. tincture tasted like any other tinctures ive ever had and was pretty good.<br /><br />flowtron-got a g of his og kush earwax. this was some of the best wax ive got on SR. It had a great golden color, awesome earwax consistency that was perfect for dabbing, and the most taste and smell ive ever experienced out of a concentrate. the flowers that were used to make this wax really come out in taste and smell, something i really look for in a quality concentrate.<br /><br />southernhumboldt- ordered an ounce of sap from him, my biggest wax purchase to date on SR and unfortunately the worst. i ordered the sap to get a variety which he claimed to give. i recieved 28 little vials with only two strains, blue dream n og kush. although i was mad about the lack of variety, that is not what really dissapointed me. the sap was absolute garbage. it was black runny oil, not sap, that sizzles on the nail and just sucks in general. i still have 10g cuz no one wants the bullshit. when i told sh about my problem with his sap, he went on with how he didnt make it so next time it will be better. when i asked for a 20% refund since his pic and description were nothing like the actual product and the product sucked, he refused and told me he will make things right which he of course never did. out of all of these vendors, i would stay away from him the most!<br /><br />sativasally- ordered a hf oz of two diff strains-pandoras box and vortex. i am a big tga subcool fan so i was stoked to get to try these strains. the pandoras box was excellent and some very tasty dank. the vortex was some fluff mcruff that looked really homegrown and like it was picked two weeks two early. shipping and customer service were very good though.<br /><br />benzoking- faggot jacked me for 350 on a moneypak. fuck that guy.<br /><br />thurgood jenkins- tried to order from him but he took over 7 days just to process my order and kept feeding my bullshit so i cancelled my order. i wasnt surprised when i saw he got kicked off SR<br /><br />crownhigh-the best bho i have got off silk road was from crownhigh. i ordered his co2 wax because the pic of it just looks amazing. ive always wanted to try some legit honeycomb like you see on high times and this looked like as close as i was ever going to get. i ordered 3 grams of girl scout cookie, 3 grams of sour diesel, and a gram of headband. the gsc wax was super tasty, sour diesel was the best and i still have people asking me for more of that, and the headband was also dank. crownhigh is a great vendor and it was cool to finally try co2 wax.<br /><br /><br /><br />if any vendor wants me to sample their product and write a more detailed review, please message me on here or SR. hope everyone has a good day!

				Today i also just ordered some of cannasieur&#039;s nectar and earwax, along with kushdepot&#039;s shatter. if anyone has any experience with these products let me know what ill be getting into! i have made the mistake of going with the cheap route and not being happy on SR so i chose two of the most expensive and dank looking waxes on SR, cant wait to dab them in a few days when they get here.

				Which vendor would you recommend for someone who smokes daily but wants to get into waxes/shatter/dabs etc. I prefer sativa over indica. I don&#039;t want price to be super outrageous of course.

				i am about to try out cannasieur and kushdepot because they both look to have some amazing waxes. i have heard that cannasieur&#039;s is the best on SR but is pretty pricy, although one thing i learned on here is you get what you pay for. i will let ya know how both of theres are when i get them. otherwise i know that flowtron, just4u2nv, and felidae will all take care of you. i heard lucymcgee is good to but i never went through her yet. if you havent got into the world of waxes and oils, i can promise you that you will love them when you try them..so much purer and stronger than herb. good luck with your decision/

				For sure! I&#039;m sick of puffing on pipes and blunts. I like too vape most of the time, but it&#039;s time for something concentrated! I want a one-hit killer and I&#039;ve heard concentrates are where it&#039;s at.<br /><br />I work from home now so I smoke in the morning. I&#039;d love to take a tiny dab and be lit for a few hours while I work. Then take another on lunch, etc.

				ya i still smoke herb once in a while(like beginning of the day n when my mooch friends come over that i dont want to waste oil on) but oil is really where its at. i live in a non medical state so its still very new here and most my friends look at me crazy when i pull out the torch, but i think it will be all anyone smokes in a couple years. I have a couple oil rigs, but you can also get a nice vape pen-i like the cloud personally- and fill that bad boy where ever you go. is it really nice being able to take a dab in public and just get super ripped without anyone thinking you are doin any more than smokin an ecig. let me know if you have any more questions..never mind helpin out someone
