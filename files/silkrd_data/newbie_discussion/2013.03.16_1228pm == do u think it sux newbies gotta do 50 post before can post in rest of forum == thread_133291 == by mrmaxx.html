				Okay, so I have just noticed your other posts mrmaxx. (-K.) You&#039;ve come here with an attitude and started spamming identical upstart threads in the Bug reports section that are just plain stupid and clog up the&nbsp; section. This section is not for idiots like you, it is for members who have legitimate problems. If you hate it so much then why are you here anyway? Nobody is forcing you to be here if you hate it so much. People like you are the reason that the idea of restricting newbies in one section was suggested in the first instance, along with bottle-necking auto-ctachpa solving bots so their malicious spam could be targeted more effectively. Take this is a hint. If you started an account with the sole purpose of stirring up shit and compromising the effectiveness of Silk Road by spamming the Support section you&#039;ll soon be negged by everyone to a degree you&#039;ll be have to start another account and begin all over again. So....... don&#039;t be a dick. Your choice.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Thanks, Razorspyne!<br /><br />Maybe 100 posts is a bit much, but you&#039;ve got to make sure people are determined....&nbsp; Perhaps a $20 fee to join that goes towards keeping the lights (on the servers) on.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to be much of a problem, and maybe that&#039;s because of the current 50 post requirement.<br /><br />lelmeriodici

				Razorspyne, it wasn&#039;t you that prompted me to put that in my signature.&nbsp; I saw a long guide to something on this forum and the first reply quoted the entire thing and wrote a one sentence response.&nbsp; That kind of stuff pisses me off.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to be in a thread (other than a newbie spam thread) that rolls along so quickly that a response like this one can&#039;t be typed before two or three more posts are made.&nbsp; And, in any case, I think doing what I did to begin this post (starting with your name) is sufficient 95% of the time.<br /><br />Anyways... yeah, as if holding people accountable was hard enough on the clear net, on TOR you can&#039;t block IP addresses to get rid of unwanted people!&nbsp; It&#039;s a whole different, totally insane world, this TOR thing is....&nbsp; ;)

				The limit is in place to stop spammers clogging up threads with BS advertising for BTC sites and the like. It serves a purpose. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like it, go elsewhere. No point complaining about it; it will never be removed now.<br /><br />When I signed up to the forums, there were almost no spam posts. Then, they exploded onto almost every topic, stifling genuine debate/conversations. This was expected as SR became more popular. <br /><br />It&#039;s not a perfect system, but it works for the most part.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I do not think it too bad because then rival comp could just create an account then post bullshit on a vendors page or whatever so the 50 post count kinda slows that type of shit out,,, Paying a fee like the other dude said is absurd BUT ti would be great to have the *option* to do just that, then some people will do it and it get the forum more money for advancement of services and what not,,, although I do not think they are lacking funds lol... I do wish they would update there server or something so the road is not so damn slow but that is my only complaint cause without the road i would be getting shit shit shit instead of da bomb diggity! :)<br /><br />K-Hole

Tips and tricks to stay out of trouble, that sort of thing.<br /><br />Although I suppose not everybody is as paranoid as I am.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I totally agree the newbie section should be where people figure things out, and learn how to cover their asses in case they do something stupid and get into trouble. Right now its just spam like crazy to get to 50 so that you can go post and annoy the shit out of the knowledgeable users.<br /><br />I think I know a decent amount I&#039;ve been reading the security thread for more than 4 months. If you have a question PM me and I&#039;ll see if I can help you.<br /><br />This 50 posts thing needs to be changed to a set of challenges that are measured like:<br /><br />1) a timer that records time spent in the forums. It also stops counting if you stay on the same page for more than an hour, you have to been scrolling through threads otherwise the clock doesn&#039;t move. This is so people can&#039;t just leave their comp on all day and reach the max time.<br /><br />2) There is also a counter for how many replies are written and how many times you quote someone other than yourself. This is to encourage an actual convo between users.<br /><br />3) They must accumulate a certain number of karma points. This is to establish that they try to help others and are not a forum troll. Like the dude who started a thread the other day about which race was the stupidest. If he needs good karma to get to the rest of the forum he wouldn&#039;t write that. Making threads like that can be fun, but they almost always turn into flame wars. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>****YES*****<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133291.msg986449#msg986449">Quote from: HiXxY26 on April 07, 2013, 12:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">too much spam<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>****** YES********<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133291.msg986354#msg986354">Quote from: californiadreams on April 07, 2013, 10:18 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">sucks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>******IT DOES TO SIFT THROUGH**********<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=133291.msg985025#msg985025">Quote from: loobaloo on April 07, 2013, 01:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Yes, but I understand their need to want to keep scammers or law enforcement out.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>***AGREED, but in ten minutes someone/anyone can sift on up***<br /><br />Not being negative, but, is there a reason this *has* to be like this??&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think the spam limit serves a purpose but I don&#039;t think having 50 posts should be the only barrier to entry. They should include an alternative method, such as how many successful purchases you&#039;ve made on the road or X amount of BTC/dollars spent. Just because a person doesn&#039;t have a high post count doesn&#039;t mean that they can&#039;t meaningfully contribute to the forums.

				The 50 post limit is great for new members... If they are really that dedicated they will ramp up to the 50 post count and everyone will have less doubt as to whether or not they belong here.<br /><br />I also think the captcha has been tremendously helpful in deterring random/spam/useless posts and the quality of the forums has increased dramatically in my opinion. I do, however, think there are more effective captchas that take less time, like dragging the piece of pizza onto the plate, or selecting the cat in an image that is blended with other images... The point is that we should and can find a captcha system that takes less time but is just as much if not more effective, and should be based on some sort of drag/drop or movement. These 6 characters really suck, but I like the idea of the captcha. <br /><br />Now that I think of it, the captcha system should be friendly to users using remote desktop, so maybe a &quot;click the item&quot; would work, something touch friendly. But seriously, trying to get a post up quickly using remote desktop with the current captcha is really frustrating.

				Hi, I am happy to learn that newbies (like myself) must submit 50 posts before moving up into the privileges of other forum postings because once I get there, hopefully, this process will have served several good purposes that will make my time here more enjoyable! (ie: less spammy adverts and crap postings to wade through and more knowledge of the basics to avoid wasting people&#039;s time with repeat posts and questions already answered). So my vote is that this was an A-OK requirement and will hopefully keep some of the miscreants at bay!&nbsp;

				Yes, it&#039;s terrible. I want to leave a review for someone but I can&#039;t. I used to leave reviews all the time in the forums, but now I can&#039;t??? Now I&#039;m just trying to get my post count to 50 by leaving semi-meaningful posts. This one excluded.
