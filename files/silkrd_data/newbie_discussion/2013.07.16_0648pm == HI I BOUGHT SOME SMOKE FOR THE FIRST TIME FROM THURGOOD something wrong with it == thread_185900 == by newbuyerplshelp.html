				Cannabis needs to be completely dried (&amp; cured) for it to light properly.&nbsp; There was probably some Coke left in the can and when you inhaled, it got the weed wet.&nbsp; Just use a dry can next time or learn how to roll a spliff / blunt.

				Hey Everyone,<br /><br />Scammerhounddog/Dealerofdrugs/Coachella420/Infinitesource/boostintohyperspace/real scumbag is posting things like I sent him dogshit and lettuce and things like that. They&#039;re too poorly done to seem real, but if you&#039;re wondering here are all the messages he&#039;s sent me telling me he&#039;ll do this:<br />http://imgur.com/rMxrkP5<br /><br />And all the threats to my feedback:<br />**clearnet**<br />http://imgur.com/S1RNW4a<br />http://imgur.com/a/bwf7o/all<br />http://imgur.com/QCwi8FN<br />http://imgur.com/xHgAWIb<br /><br />Please note a few things that prove just how batshit insane these are:<br />1. Heatfan is crossed out and Thurgood written over it. If I was really running multiple accounts and was a top 14% vendor on one of them, I wouldn&#039;t be so dumb as to be like &quot;o, wait, no, I&#039;m not heatfan, let me just cross that out and write Thurgood, cause that&#039;s good enough right?&quot; No, that&#039;s just obvious bullshit. Also, on my vendor page it says none of my packages contain handwriting, so obviously I never sent that.<br /><br />2. The Mods are on my side:<br />http://i.imgur.com/CsLtxFY.png<br />http://imgur.com/DTgHJsV<br />Here are the mods confirming Dealerofdrugs is Coachella420 and the like and just being douche.<br /><br />3. Why would a vac seal dog shit so that it doesn&#039;t stink and so that he would never have to handle it? All he would have to do is throw it away, so that doesn&#039;t make any sense.<br /><br />4. None of this exists on my feedback from people who have proof of ordering from me. If he could take a screenshot of any order placed that&#039;d be awesome. Just an FYI, those who FE can still update feedback. So if he says you made me FE(only people that place FE orders have to FE) he could still change the feedback, so it&#039;s obvious bullshit. Any screenshot of messages from me, or any correspondence or business would be nice.<br /><br />5. It all started on /r/silkroad if you want to go look. here&#039;s a link to where I got involved:<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1icxgs/to_put_an_end_to_the_dod_fun/<br /><br />6.
