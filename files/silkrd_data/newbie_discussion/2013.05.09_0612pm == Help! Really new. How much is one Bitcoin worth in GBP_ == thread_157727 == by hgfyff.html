				You can monitor the exchange rate at https://mtgox.com/index.html?Currency=GBP<br /><br />Currently, 1 bitcoin = ~74 GBP

				Have a look on MT GOX they,re about Â£74 lowest price or buy from localbitcoins.com you,ll pay slightly more here but you can see the prices from different sellers depends on the amount you have to buy and you need an online bank account to do either of these but if you have that its easy and safe the money is held in escrow untill you get your coins, hope this helps

				Bitcoins themselves are not illegal (so far), so there&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with visiting Mt. Gox over clearnet.<br /><br />If you&#039;re being extremely, extra, super careful, your plausible deniability is stronger if you have no records tracing you to anything remotely associated with SR, including Bitcoin. But honestly, unless you&#039;ve got big plans to become a hotshot super dealer, I wouldn&#039;t worry.

				There&#039;s nothing incriminating about visiting the MtGox website. Just be careful what else you visit alongside it (in the unsafe browser).<br />See also bitcoincharts.com for the trends over time.<br /><br />Sellers here have overheads unlike those of street dealers:<br />$500+ up-front to register a vendor account<br />15% SilkRoad fee per sale<br />At least 10% to cash out the BTC - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6271.0<br />P&amp;P<br /><br />This place also provides better safety and anonymity, which vendors are within their rights to charge a premium for. If this weren&#039;t the case, market forces would be expected to push prices down.<br /><br />You should learn about the BTC blockchain before just buying them anywhere. The complete movement of every BTC transaction is viewable by anyone - blockchain.info . Care should be taken not to associate your IRL self with the BTC transactions you conduct.
