				I wouldn&#039;t FE, especially for a large purchase. Keep looking, there are tons of weed vendors on SR and I am sure you can find someone reliable that won&#039;t make you do it.

				If you don&#039;t have many purchases / history and you want a QP or more then yes some vendors are going to want FE. Typically if they give a DCN showing its delivered they will get the BTC out of the escrow though if you wait for AF it could take 17 days; some vendors don&#039;t want to risk waiting that long on that kind of quantity, especially if they&#039;re not huge volume sellers.

				Personally as a buyer I would try to find a vendor that does not require you to FE. <br />We ourselves do not require anyone to FE, and we actually advise against it clearly on our profile.<br /><br />However, I do understand the FE requirement from a vendor&#039;s point of view. Some vendors cannot financially afford to have many orders in transit. You must understand that having $10-100k of orders in escrow/transit is common amongst large vendors. FE would help maintain their liquidity. Also asking NEW buyers (say &lt;10 purchases on SR) to FE weeds out the scammers. <br /><br />Best,<br />DM

				I see everyone&#039;s point on the FE. honestly when I would have friends mail me stuff it would also be a &quot;FE&quot; type situation. Money would be transferred and the product would be mailed. The difference being I knew sender,so i knew that the package had been sent. IF shit got seized&nbsp; that would have been all on me. I doubt my friend would be able to come up with a few grand...With this place I have no idea who is on the other end.I can see the side from the vendor, weed stinks larger potential of seizure compared to other drugs.
