				I have been doing this for a while and I always used bitinstant and never had any problems with it, other than the site going down once in a while or temporarily removing the bitcoin to email address option. Anyways, these fuqers stole $500 from me. I made an order and it never came. I emailed them and they said they would take care of it so I waited a few days and got nothing. I emailed them some more and now they wont even respond to me!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; Why is it so difficult to get bitcoins, if the legit businesses are going to rob you than how can I trust anyone

As long as you haven&#039;t messed up the address.<br />You could try to contact them on their facebook if you aren&#039;t worried about anonymity.

				I obviously wrote the correct email because I got the other emails. I have used bitinstant at least 100 times and I have never had an issue where they wont email me back for five days.

				I had an issue with a transaction on friday right before they went down for cash deposits. I filled out the slip on their support site and within 10 mins I had a reply saying my funds were safe and she had personally did a manual transaction. About 2 hours later, whala....weekend shopping spree!

				Bitinstant is trustworthy..they will not steal your money. Yet Bitinstant doesn&#039;t serve all countries.<br /><br />Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />

Use at your own risk.
