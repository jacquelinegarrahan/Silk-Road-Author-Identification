				So I don&#039;t want to be a giant faggot who spams to 50 posts, so I&#039;m starting this thread. Feel free to carry out casual conversations or jump in to ongoing ones. Questions are also welcomed as newbies can&#039;t ask elsewhere. I&#039;ll begin.<br /><br />How is it going for everyone today?

				I&#039;ve been chillin at home for a while because I recently got a rash around my butt. It came out of nowhere and is annoying as fuck, so itchy. I&#039;ve been smoking lots of herb to try to distract myself; thankfully it seems to be getting better, I hope. That&#039;s what has been up in my life as of recently. I&#039;m just being honest, because why not? hah. I&#039;m not gay by the way, so nothin to do with that! To anyone who has experienced this stupid rash/itching, you know that is fucking sucks. <br /><br />My roommate sprung on me that he wanted a dog over the phone yesterday morning, which was rather impulsive. I said I didn&#039;t want to own any pets at this point, as much as I love them. He then proceeded to tell me he is thinking about moving out. Long-story short he changes his mind within 24hours. Definition of impulsive.<br /><br />

				Wow haha he is impulsive. I have a rash atm too so ik that feel haha, my day is going pretty good. Made my first order recently, hope it all goes out well.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to think of things to talk about really as I don&#039;t want to reveal any personal information xD. <br /><br />Sooo, if you have 1,500BTC; what would you do with it? Time for a fantasy thread haha :D!<br /><br />
