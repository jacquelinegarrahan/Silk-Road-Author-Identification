				So I plan candyflipping with a sitter.<br />I have experience wit lsd and xtc.<br /><br />I have a blotter of 120ug and 1 pill of xtc 120mg.<br />I have been reading different opinions about the timing and so on. I have decided I take my blotter and 3-4 hours later xtc pill.<br /><br />But my question is the dosage:<br /><br />IS IT OK AFTER I TAKE LSD AND THEN SOME HOURS LATER XTC TO TAKE AGAIN 1.5-2 HOURS LATER ANOTHER HALF-PILL OF XTC? OR IS IT TOO MUCH OF XTC?

				I would take the half XTC pill and wait till it kicks in, if it feels good and you have no problems, take the other half too.<br />Note: I have never done this myself, some experienced user may call bullshit on this :P

				i havent done this for about 13 years - took a pill and a tab at a primal scream gig - and had a fucking ball<br /><br />but i cant rememeber what order we did it in, or how strong shit was back then<br /><br />best advice is to go slow - you can always take more later

				Hahahaha well ^^ this guy has some pretty great advice I gotta say. Barring that, yeah man of course you&#039;ll be fine. They go awesome together. One of each really isn&#039;t that much. You might even want a bit more X later on as it starts to wear off but you&#039;re still tripping balls, just don&#039;t overdo it. Yea see how you feel, I would take the X earlier than that maybe like an hour or 2 after the tab, and then more later on if you feel like it. Have fun&nbsp; 8)

				I agree with the guy above. I love candyflipping. <br />I&#039;m curious about other combos as well. I&#039;m soon to try 2c-e + mdma.

				Candyflipping is unio mistica together with a full communion with others around you. Its divine and social at the same time. Its magic, cannot describe. But definitively not for children !

				Sounds like a good plan. Why don&#039;t you just see how you feel than about re-dosing.

				On July 21, 1998 at a Phish show in Phoenix, I took a little square of white on white in the lot and a capsule with who-knows-how-much tan molly before we walked in the doors. One of the best nights of my life. I watched the music pour out of the speakers and wash over the crowd. So yeah. Good time.
