				Been meaning to sign up for silk road for a bit... The MOM shop i use for mail order weed is way to costly lately, so I figured id venture on here and read up a bit before purchasing anything.<br /><br />One thing I noticed that i have wanted for a few years was liquid Ketamine, does anyone ever see that go up for sale?<br /><br />Well Hello everyone!!!

				hey hugethehand<br />welcome to the road<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166938.msg1189012#msg1189012">Quote from: HughTheHand on June 01, 2013, 11:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One thing I noticed that i have wanted for a few years was liquid Ketamine, does anyone ever see that go up for sale?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i signed up on SR mainly because i couldnt find any quality K anymore where i am. there is lots of quality stuff on the the road. i would be careful ordering liquid vials. you will be taking a much much higher risk. most of the liquid k comes from india which is a country at higher risk to get shipments from already. you can find dried k which is water soluble for injection. obviously once its dried you cant tell for sure its pure but you can also get tampered vials so nothing is perfect. i have been doing k for years and years and have gotten countless brands of liquid k vials over this time and dried them. i can say without doubt there is powdered k on SR just as pure. just make sure to research your vendor, check ratings and feedback on SR and also make sure to check there vendor page on the forum, read reviews and ask questions use common sense when choosing what countries to order from and you will be in a deep hole in no time&nbsp; :o

				Thank you everyone.&nbsp; I am more of a lurker then poster.<br /><br />I wanted the liquid because I used to mix some vanilla flavoring in it then cook it up to make the drip taste like candy.<br /><br /><br />So far i am enjoying myself here, still learning the ropes, being careful and placing small orders.<br /><br />thank!!!

				Welcome to the club!<br /><br />Make sure to post a review of the vendor(s) that you use so that others can benefit from your experiences.&nbsp; It helps both the merchants and customers and it doesn&#039;t help that it bumps up your post count. ;)
