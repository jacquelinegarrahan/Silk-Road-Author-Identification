				Just logged on to check on my orders and see this vendor has asked me to FE. I&#039;m torn between being greedy and taking a gamble with my .16BTC or just taking my business elsewhere. I can understand requesting FE for low new buyer stats, but not really feeling it from a newer vendor. I think I&#039;ll play it safe for now and reorder if things turn around. I&#039;d be interested to hear if anyone who has already FE&#039;d gets their order.

				DON&#039;T FE. It&#039;s really simple. Don&#039;t give anonymous drug dealers your money before you have anything from them. It doesn&#039;t matter how legit they look or what your gut says. They can turn. Plus it&#039;s just the principle of it- if people didn&#039;t do it all the time, it wouldn&#039;t be so prevalent. Sorry, I&#039;m getting pretty tired of this.

				Seems really sketchy to be honest, his feedback is completely full of people that are willing to FE. Although apparently he is not requesting people with high purchasing stats to FE so maybe it is legit, but the person who posted that ordered an enormous amount of LSD (1k hits), so it could be part of his scam. We will findout soon.

				He&#039;s not a scammer. He&#039;s a new vendor that is bending over backwards to give you great prices.<br /><br />You want to know why most people will have to FE nowadays more than ever?<br /><br />Teenagers are all over the road due to recent publicity and Tumblr.

				Yeah, it looks pretty sketchy. I sent a message about my intent to cancel so we&#039;ll see what comes of that. Now, as for cancelling, from what I gather there is some kind of waiting period before this is an option on my order status? Does it matter if the vendor has marked my order in transit even though they haven&#039;t shipped yet? Or do I need to put in a resolution through SR?

				Alice,<br /><br />Just because others have ordered, FE&#039;d, and gotten product, does not mean this hasn&#039;t gone scam.&nbsp; Fact of the matter is that the vendor page said NOTHING about requiring FE, and then the vendor decided to &quot;request&quot; FE only AFTER marking &quot;in transit,&quot; thus ensuring that BTCs would be held up for a long period of time, which ostensibly would encourage people to just say &quot;fuck it&quot; and FE.<br /><br />It may not be a scam.&nbsp; It may be.&nbsp; But one way or the other, it is highly irregular, suspicious, and sketchy behavior on the vendor&#039;s part.&nbsp; No amount of benefit of the doubt can erase that simple truth.&nbsp; Be careful.

Granted, I got on the site due to open registration - but with all of the hullaballoo abut security - as well as some of the idiots we&#039;ve seen on here, closed registrations would be a great idea. <br /><br />That being said - new, legitimate vendors can&#039;t come along then...so we&#039;re stuck with who is here. <br />A counter-point, again - would be that we could close registration until things blow over - let things sit as they are for a while, and once people drop off - or publicity dies down, open them back up again for a while.

				I have never ordered from this vendor before but if you are feeling uneasy about an order then walk away. Never go into a situation without being sure. Sure maybe everything would smoothly and fine but maybe it will go south. Either way it is better to go in knowing whats up.
