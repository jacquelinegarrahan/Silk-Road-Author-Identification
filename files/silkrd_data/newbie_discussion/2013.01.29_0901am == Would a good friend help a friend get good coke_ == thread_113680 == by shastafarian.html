				Prior to a few days ago my friend was just a weed/shroom/acid guy. I sold him some delicious SR molly, which he promptly proceeded to abuse the shit out of, rolling two days in a row despite my warning him that it fucks up your brain.&nbsp; Now 2 days after his last roll he&#039;s determined to try coke, because he heard it was like molly only more euphoric.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty convinced coke would fuck him up because he can barely go a day without smoking weed. Now I&#039;m just trying to decide if I&#039;d be a good friend to help him get pure shit from here in the interest of harm reduction, or stand back and let him do stupid shit by himself.<br /><br />Opinions/ what would you do in this situation?

				If your friend has his mind set on trying coke for the first time I would help him by letting him read up on the drug. I would try to convince him there are also other less addictive drugs then coke. If he still wants to try it I would ask him if he has any good hook ups for it. If he doesn`t have any hook ups I wouldn&#039;t help him and if he does I`d ask him if it`s good quality in stead of cut to shit coke. If he does have a contact and I know that he sells bad quality coke I`d try and help him find a good hook up. If he`s gonna try it I`d rather have him use good quality instead of bad.

				Each to their own, friend. Coke&#039;s a hard habit to sustain, especially if you&#039;re buying it from here. There&#039;s not much damage he&#039;s going to do to himself with only one gram.<br /><br />Also, on the MDMA front, doing two days in a row isn&#039;t going to fry your brain, it just doesn&#039;t really work is all. You stay awake but there&#039;s hardly any euphoria. <br />
