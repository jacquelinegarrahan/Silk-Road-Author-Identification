				Hi,<br /><br />sorry for a trivial question, but I failed to find out so far, and I&#039;m not sure if http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide&amp;oldid=388#Escrow answers it:<br /><br />When an item&#039;s price is tied to USD, at which point does it stop fluctuating and become fixed in BTC? When the order is first placed, when the vendor accepts it, or when I finalise it?

				To my knowledge....<br /><br />The prices become fixed in btc when you place the order.&nbsp; <br /><br />HOWEVER, the question comes back up if a refund is placed.&nbsp; Vendors can &quot;hedge&quot; a payment, meaning that even if the price of btc fluctuates, your order is priced and paid with the btc-usd value, at the time the order was placed.&nbsp; Hedging becomes important if there is a refund situation.&nbsp; In a hedged refund, you will receive the amount of btc that currently values the same as the usd price you paid.&nbsp; You may receive less or more btc, but it will be the same usd amount.<br /><br />In an UNhedged refund, the usd amount was NOT saved into the transaction.&nbsp; So, regardless of the usd value, regardless of current btc value, if you paid 2 btc, you receive 2 btc.<br /><br />Hedged orders are benefcial all the way around when the btc market is fluctuating dramatically, especially in a downward trend.&nbsp; It protects you from loosing money.&nbsp; Unhedged can be beneficial when prices are going up, because your 2btc will be worth more than they were last week.<br />Unfortunately, that is something solely up to the vendor&#039;s discretion, so all you can really do is look at the market and decide if its worth a risk working with someone who is not hedging their orders.&nbsp; I personally dont see it as a huge issue right now, and could care less.&nbsp; But it makes the whole process slightly more complex..
