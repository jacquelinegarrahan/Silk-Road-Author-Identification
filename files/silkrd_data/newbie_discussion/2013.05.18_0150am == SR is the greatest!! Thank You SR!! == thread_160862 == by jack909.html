				Well, I must say...... I absolutely love this site!! Whoever created this, Thank you!!! As I&#039;m sure that many of the people on this site have before finding SR, I too have been burned many times by multiple scam sites on the web.&nbsp; Each time I&#039;d get so excited waiting for my order to come, but it never would.&nbsp; But then, 4 days ago I found SR and became a member.&nbsp; 1 day later I loaded my account and placed my first ever SR order.&nbsp; That item was delivered to me today, just as promised (actually quicker than promised)!!!&nbsp; Words cannot even begin to express my gratitude, so again I say THANK YOU SR!&nbsp; I will be a life long member, as I greatly appreciate everything that this site does....<br /><br />Jack

				Huzzah. <br /><br />I am glad you made it here. Most people would give up after being ripped off by BMR, Atlantis, Hidden Wiki, etc. We are the one and only community that does legit business and it is growing. So far, I have spent $1500 on the road. I have been burned once for a $10 sample and that is because I Finalized Early. NEVER FE!!!<br />NEVER FINALIZE EARLY. Stay away from rock bottom prices. Stick to vendors with 90% + and NEVER FE! If a vendor asks you to FE or RE or what the fuck ever early you say FU. Stay safe and feel safe ordering on Silk Road. Long live Silk Road!
