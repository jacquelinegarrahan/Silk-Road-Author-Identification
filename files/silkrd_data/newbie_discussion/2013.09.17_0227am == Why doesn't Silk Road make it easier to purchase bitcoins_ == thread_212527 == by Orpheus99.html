				One of the most difficult, if not the most difficult tasks SR users have to deal with is obtaining bitcoins.&nbsp; There are bitcoin sellers on SR but there are more scammers amongst them than anywhere else on SR.&nbsp; Further, the SR administrators offer no help or oversight for buyers attempting to purchase bitcoins on the site.&nbsp; The other alternative is to purchase bitcoins from a site specializing in bitcoin exchange.&nbsp; But the problem here is that learning how to use these sites is not easy.&nbsp; At least that has been my experience.&nbsp; Since obtaining bitcoins is so essential for using SR, why doesn&#039;t SR facilitate bitcoin exchanges?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure one obstacle is that SR probably is concerned with liability, i.e., if one of the bitcoin sellers engaged in scamming SR might be afraid of being held responsible.&nbsp; That could easily be overcome by making users of the exchange accept that SR offers no assurances and takes no responsibility for the outcome of an exchange (e.g., users would have to check &#039;yes&#039; to the terms and conditions, including this one, before using the service).&nbsp; Then SR could set a higher bond for bitcoin sellers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any complaints against a bitcoin vendor would be investigated quickly by an administrator.&nbsp; If there are several complains in one day, the administrator could put that vendor on hold status until the problems were resolved.&nbsp; These are just a couple suggestions to demonstrate the feasibility of an SR facilitated bitcoin exchange service and how potential problems can easily be addressed.&nbsp; &nbsp;How it might actually be designed and develop is not really my point.&nbsp; As we all know, SR has some very capable administrators and I&#039;m sure that, if they set their minds to it, they could come up with a workable system far better than any I can currently conceive.&nbsp; &nbsp;The issue I am concerned with is why SR seems to have ignored the central issue of how buyers can obtain bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anyone know?&nbsp; Can a SR administrator comment?&nbsp;

				Because if you can&#039;t purchase bitcoins on your own you shouldn&#039;t be buying.

				I don&#039;t think this is the SR&#039;s responsibility, I think this more lies in the hands of the people.<br />Heck, I&#039;m still waiting on my BTC atm to pop up.

				scammers. on both ends.<br /><br />besides, it isn&#039;t hard to get coins, hell if you&#039;re desperate you can get them on ebay. a few months ago i grabbed .25 btc on ebay cuz the price wasn&#039;t bad, now I buy directly from the guy, via paypal, all the time, and for something like a 4% fee. honestly, that&#039;s the best option, but you have to know/befriend a btc miner.

				My guess is that would make them easy to track down. <br /><br />New people make buying coins way harder than it needs to be on themselves. So much so they get more stressed out over buying coins than than what they buy on SR. <br /><br />You will get the hang of it without resorting to MP which I strongly suggest you don&#039;t do.
