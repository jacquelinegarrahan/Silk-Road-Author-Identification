				so i&#039;m going to be making a purchase from the SR hopefully in the next month. i&#039;ve been reading around here and getting a lot of information but i&#039;m still confused. on a lot of things<br /><br />is the whole downloading TOR on a usb thing necessary. right now i&#039;ve been browsing SR from TOR on my laptop through a neighbors wifi connection. is it safe to make my purchase like this<br /><br />also the whole bit coin thing is highly confusing. what is the easiest, yet a safe and secure way, to get bitcoins? i need about about 10 total. for now (;<br /><br />and i&#039;m not sure if this is against the rules but i am interested in mdma.<br />the stuff in the US, where i am, is expensive. i want to get it from germany, most likely, and i was wondering how often customs seizes packages. <br /><br />sorry for another repetitive post...but information and links would be appreciated

				I&#039;d encourage you to spend a lot more time reading here on the forums because most of those questions could be answered by doing a simple search.

				i figured i&#039;d get an answer like that. i know, i do need to spend more time researching the actual process. i&#039;ve just spent most of my time window shopping, as i&#039;m in so much shock from this great service we got going on here haha <br /><br />also, i&#039;m pleased with the amount of traffic on this boards. bravo

				There&#039;s a Good Vendor on here in the money section called Sugar Mama that sells BTCs for moneypaks for a fee, if you spend 2k or more you get it lowered, I recommend always doing 500 increments though for the lowest fee. Also Blue sky Traders is good if You have a Bank of America close by here&#039;s a link http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm Fees are ALOT cheaper there I&#039;m using them for my next purchase.<br /><br />As Far as MDMA goes I would probably try a few Domestic vendors first to get you purchasing stats up even though its a little pricey, I imagine you&#039;re more likely to get selectively scammed on a large international order on a FE. There&#039;s a few domestic vendors that don&#039;t require FE for new buyers as well and the prices aren&#039;t too bad (50 a g on 10g or larger orders for some) I recommend UnderGroundSyndicate Or Polygamuz if he was still around (Stealth mode =[)<br />once you get at least 5 and prolly 400-1000$ in transactions I&#039;d start giving International a shot, Just ALWAYS do your research on the forums on whatever vendor you decide, any could go rouge anytime, its the game
