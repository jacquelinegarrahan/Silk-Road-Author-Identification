				I recently tried out a reputable 2-CB vendor called nawlins.&nbsp; I needed the product in a matter of two days.&nbsp; I contacted him many times back and forth, and ultimately he was able to get the product to me overnight.&nbsp; To top it off, the product is spot on, an amazingly fun drug with a great group of friends who play music.<br /><br />Just wanted to be sure to give a shout out to him because I have seen negative comments regarding him, but I have experienced nothing but fast communication and he was able to expressly send something no other vendor i contacted was able to do.&nbsp; I would definitely return to nawlins.<br /><br />

				Wow, thanx for the review.<br />2C-B was what I was seeking when I first found The Road. I&#039;ve been looking forward to trying it again, so you think nawlins is my man?

				its not always the cheapest necessarily on SR, but I can at least speak from personal experience in the USA, it is top notch service and quality...if you are experienced in the 2cb arts and you have a proper MG scale, I would highly recommend the powder in its purest form, there is nothing quite like it.&nbsp; Just be careful because the stuff is sooooo potent. .5g will keep you and your friends skyrocketed for months to come.<br /><br />and the nawlins team is super communicative, and happy to answer questions and facilitate logistics for you.

				I like the idea of getting it in powder form but I&#039;d be super worried that I&#039;d dose wrong... sigh

				MAHAKALA also does a great job with his 2c-b. And he has the absolute best stealth of any vendor Ive ever seen. Very clever and creative. And he has cheap 2c-b too!

				I had a fairly good transaction with nawlins as well, shipping time was a little slow but everything else was spot on!

				Im really looking hard into the 2c family. I have tried 25i and know thats a derivitive from 2ci. Does anyone have advice on a personal favorite of the 2c family. I have heard 2cb-fly is the best but also extremely hard to find.
