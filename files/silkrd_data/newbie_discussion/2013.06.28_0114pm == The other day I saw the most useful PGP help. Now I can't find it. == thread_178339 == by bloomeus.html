				There was a post up the other day, which was essentially an all-inclusive tutorial on making purchases. What was very useful to me was that it provided a link to a website, which helped to easily create the necessary PGP encrypted message to send to a seller. <br />All that was required was to copy the seller&#039;s public key into a box, copy some things down, transfer those items to another page on which you write the message, and hit enter. Then you had your encrypted message. <br />I can&#039;t seem to find this post again. Can anyone help? Does anyone know the website which I am referring too? I&#039;m not very good with computers and this easy, basic-needs website really helped me out.

				That is not the website I was looking for. Also, I have a mac, so that program won&#039;t work. Furthermore, the descriptions of all of these downloadable programs are so complex, I have no idea what they are talking about.<br />The website which I am referring too didn&#039;t require downloading anything. It just did it for you right there. <br />This is so frustrating. I wish I had bookmarked it. It was such an awesome website and it was right there. Super easy to use. And the link was in a post I saw on here not 2 days ago but now I can&#039;t seem to find that thread no matter how much I search for it. I don&#039;t need to know everything about pgp or to download a program. All I wanna do is support a little free trade with some of my hard earned bills, dangit.<br />Thanks for the suggestions tho.
