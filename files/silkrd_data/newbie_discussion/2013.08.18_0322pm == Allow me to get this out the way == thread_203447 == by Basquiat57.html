				A man like myself views life to be something very dear, something of deep meaning and value. I believe, as most people, something as special as life should be appreciated, loved and most of all, enjoyed. I don&#039;t know about you, but to truly enjoy something, I have to do so on my own terms or else true satisfaction is impossible. For most of my life, such a thing as true satisfaction was a myth for I wasn&#039;t living on my own terms. I was living by the rules of other men, men who couldn&#039;t care less if their rules made me happy or not. I speak of the same men who use my money to wage wars and live as kings in their thrown of blood and lies. I blindly lived by their rules, thus leading my soul to starvation. Yes, my deepest self, my very being was starved by this system. These men were effective in their efforts. Deep in my spirit I could feel an anguish, a choatic emptiness I couldn&#039;t escape. There walls of law and society kept closing in on me until I said &quot;Fuck it!&quot;.<br /><br />That was years ago and I&#039;ve found myself here. Its really amazing what you all have going here. It looks like a great community and to me, the drugs just seem like a byproduct of what Silk Road is. I might need some help getting used to it though. <br /><br />Also, I aim to be a vendor eventually, as I have access to a shitload of decent cocaine where I live. And it seems the coke prices here are quite high, so I&#039;d be happy to oblige.<br /><br />Basquiat

				Welcome to the SR.&nbsp; This is an amazing place free of judgement or false ideologies.&nbsp; Imagine how much more crime there would be if we didn&#039;t have the SR?&nbsp; It elevates the sale of party supplies to a level of professionalism and accountability that is non existent on the streets.&nbsp;

				Your right, silk road has gone some way to restoring my dwindling faith in &#039;society&#039;. Picking up a copy of the daily mail in pub last night reminded me have how far we have to go. <br />On a page called &#039;platells people&#039; she called the actions of the two poor girls caught smuggling in peru &quot;simply pure evil&#039;.&nbsp; Had my blood boiling for a minute!&nbsp; We&#039;ve started but we&#039;ve got some way to go yet!
