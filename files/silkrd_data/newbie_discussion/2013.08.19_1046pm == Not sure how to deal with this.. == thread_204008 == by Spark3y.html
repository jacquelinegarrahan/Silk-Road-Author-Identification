				So 16 days ago I ordered some MDMA off of a vendor called Haizenberg, great feedback, top 6% of vendors and all that. It was marked as in transit 15 days ago and I&#039;ve been waiting patiently ever since. It is being shipped from Czech Republic to an Island in west Europe, with estimated shipping of 5-7 days. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m not accusing him of anything, as I didn&#039;t FE but so far there has been no communication. I took it to resolution center as it came up 3 days ago and put in a time extension or refund proposal and sent him a message but I haven&#039;t heard anything since. It runs out tomorrow and I think because it&#039;s my first buy, they will probably side with him, do I have any other options? I read on the forums that he can sometimes be slow but is a good person, and others accusing him of being a selective scammer. Do I just accept the cash is gone?

				No tracking, it was my first purchase so I went with the cheapest option. Hopefully he gets back to me before it runs out today

				Well contact SR and try for a refund if you do get it id close the account you have after movint the BTC to a new account as 100% refund rate is pretty shitty but if not you are no worse off then just letting them have the coin
