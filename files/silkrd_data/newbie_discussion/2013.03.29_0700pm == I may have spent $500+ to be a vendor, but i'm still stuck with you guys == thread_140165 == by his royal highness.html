				and i wouldn&#039;t have it any other way :)<br /><br />new vendor promotion.&nbsp; this is likely the only promotion in the history of SR only being advertised to new buyers, and giving you free shit.&nbsp; 50 posts, shit.&nbsp; 5 purchases, shiiiiit.<br /><br />probably won&#039;t last two long.&nbsp; you pay for shipping if you choose anything but FCM.<br /><br />here we go.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0086b43c11

				Welcome to the road!<br /><br />Its says your priority shipping is free, So Is there a SPECIFIC shipping option that the travelers of the road have to select for your free sample ?<br /><br /><br />SurfinSilly

				good catch!&nbsp; &nbsp;it takes a minute set all these up and i guess i fucked it up.&nbsp; thanks for not using that option.&nbsp; &nbsp;FCM is free.&nbsp; priority will require you pay for shipping.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;m actually a little surprised as of now only two people have signed up for free methylone.&nbsp; &nbsp;maybe i should charge for it?&nbsp; ha.<br /><br />HRH

				i would reveal the vendor, but I don&#039;t have his permission and to be honest, he&#039;s one of many i&#039;ve dealt with on a china drop ship from SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;all have been excellent IMHO.&nbsp; &nbsp;so if i said this is &quot;vendor a&quot; methylone it wouldn&#039;t be true when i order from &quot;vendor b&quot; next time.&nbsp; &nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; its definitely on par with any m1 on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;since my people&#039;s have eaten almost every vendor nevita, gonzo, smile market, movement, lwang, sprayman.&nbsp; &nbsp; i think that&#039;s it.&nbsp; &nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; i think the powder hits harder than the moonrock, but people want moonrocks so moonrocks you shall have. :)<br /><br />its like meth of the early 2000&#039;s.&nbsp; the red phos was never in rocks.&nbsp; all powder.&nbsp; &nbsp;then, somewhere along the line they learned how to crystalize and rock it up.&nbsp; &nbsp;now, even attempting to selling anything but shard form is just asking to be insulted by these shard loving, shiny object obsessed motherfuckers.<br /><br />
