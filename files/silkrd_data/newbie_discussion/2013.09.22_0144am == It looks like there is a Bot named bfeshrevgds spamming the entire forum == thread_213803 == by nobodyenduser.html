				Personally I would never buy anything from anyone who uses this method of advertising. If so you are looking for trouble and I have a bridge to sell you.

				It looks like I spoke too soon because all of the posts about selling bitcoin are gone. Right on! Someone monitoring the forum responded fast and cleaned that shit out of here. That is good to know!

				This happens pretty often.&nbsp; Threadbombs advertising bitcoin that take up the entire page.&nbsp; Too bad none of us give two shits about whatever they&#039;re advertising and just want to use the forum without the hassle of having to scroll past their 100 posts to other pages.

				I delete that shit multiple times a day, they are persistent little fuckers though, I liked it when Tessellated DDoS&#039;d them and took them down, gave them a taste of their own medicine ;)

Its actually easier to just to delete their accounts and posts all in one go, the bot posts around 60 to 70 times in quick succession filling up the newbie board then spilling into the other sections, 3 clicks on my laptop and they are gone. Admittedly sometimes they do persist creating new accounts over and over but seriously who buys into their shitty bitcoin scams anyway?
