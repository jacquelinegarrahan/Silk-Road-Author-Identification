				Which vendor has the best dope for slamming?<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried 4 of the popular guys and it was fine dope.&nbsp; Smoked well.&nbsp; But none have given &quot;the vapors&quot; which which is kind of a big deal to guys who rock it like that.<br /><br />Any recommendations?&nbsp; Only USA based vendors.

				I could personally recommend HammerTime and XinHai. I dont smoke though, so my opinion may not hold much weight with your inquiry. <br /><br />Ive heard Kush and chaletla have awesome gear also.

				Realize that 99% of vendor feedback is written by inexperienced idiots and idiots who are inexperienced.<br /><br />You&#039;ll probably learn eventually to avoid the current &quot;top sellers&quot;/volume sellers. <br /><br />Keep up with the meth review thread. Contribute. Make friends. You get much mors colorful opinions via PM exchange, especially when you find a couple others with the same taste in gear. <br /><br />Try vendor kingcopkilla. Just trust me on that.

More like most the time. I&#039;ve never been very satisfied with any orders from any of them. Some find them to be &quot;ok&quot; or reliable fall backs (especially Kush411).&nbsp; Kush isn&#039;t bad actually but for the money I can get 2x something more my &quot;style&quot;.<br /><br />But if were looking for, say some invincible sexed euphoria type gear I&#039;d shop elsewhere as I&#039;ve never found it at the top. Id check that earlier recommendation up there. ;)

				The vendors that got the hottest shit out now, if you got the coins - kingcopkilla, he&#039;s got some fire and fantastic service and processing. .heisenburg - Also got some fire the last I&#039;ve tried. Service and processing was ok.<br /><br />If you want to save money and go with some pretty good gear.&nbsp; Firstclassfix, been rocking his shit for the past week and it&#039;s not bad at all...service and processing is one of&nbsp; the top in my book.

				I am posting this across every thread relating to meth vendors particularly to Chaletla<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole story with my order:<br />Order marked in transit day after. I wait one week checking the mail, and nothing. I start sending messages to track it. I get a reply that it&#039;s going to be sent tomorrow (that&#039;s 9 days after marked in transit!). I gave the benefit of the doubt. Three days later I receive a bag of stuff that looks like ketamine tiny shards. THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER FINALIZE UPON RECEIPT. I smoked it and I guess if you&#039;re an idiot from a state like mine that doesn&#039;t know too much about tina maybe someone might&#039;ve thought &quot;thats what crystal must be like.&quot; So I reply that I better get the real stuff and I want it express for the utterly obnoxious wait time. Two days later I receive a package of 60% big ass beautiful shards. Awesome product. The other 40% was that same crap. But like a dummy I saw those gigantic beautiful shards and hit the finalize button. As a seller on the streets I figured I have a lot of people who just sniff so I&#039;ll give them that. Two of those people felt sick for two days. Personally after I accidentally mixed some with the big shards to smoke-test it, later in the day my hands, mouth, forehead, and forearms became pockmarked. I have no idea why this seller chose to fuck with me specifically given his amazing reviews and honestly a 5/5 level product. However I seen forum postings about people with less than 5 transactions getting this fake shit. So if you have less than five be REAL WEARY of this guys shit. So, Chaletla, I hope all the people with low stats that buy from you and never tried tina or just not too good with understanding what REAL meth is wake the fuck up and don&#039;t fall for your &quot;meth.&quot; If you want me to make this a 5/5 review, (and your product was 5/5) then send real shit and not in a ratio of real to fake. JUST REAL<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; Vendor got the message that I was one upset customer. He offered to resend the package, +weight, and express. The package arrived on time and was perhaps the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. GIGANTIC shards and beyond superb quality. My only advice to newbies or buyers with low stats is to message him before buying it and making sure that everything will be on point. Let him know you have heard about it happening to others and will not stand for it if it happens to you. <br /><br />Vendor told me that his packaging person was fired solely because of how I was treated as a customer. Chaletla takes customer satisfaction very seriously and I admire the tremendous effort he undertook to make my transaction satisfactory to me.
