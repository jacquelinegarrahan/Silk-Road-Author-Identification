				I&#039;ve had the same problem when it comes to logging in - even on the correct SR URL. Sometimes it takes multiple attempts to log on but it&#039;ll eventually go through. Not really sure what&#039;s going on.

				I opened a new tab and tried again and it worked.&nbsp; which is strange because I had done that during my first lot of login attempts and that had failed.&nbsp; Obviously it&#039;s just an undocumented design feature that is there as an obstacle to make sure we&#039;re together enough to use the site ;)

You might have been scammed...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />There seems to be rumors flying about on how NorCalKing has started selectively scamming, so lets put this all to rest!<br /><br />USPS has been feeling the effects of downsizing &amp; closing some of their facilities.&nbsp; These moves have been showing up in longer transit times &amp; even packages missing.&nbsp; There are a number of threads in the forums about much longer transit times &amp; customers wondering if their vendor is scamming them, transit times from 10 - 20+ days have been documented by a growing number of people.<br /><br />We have experienced the same problems, &amp; with having several customers receiving their packages 10 - 14 days after we sent them out, when someone lets us know that they have not received their package we will ask to extend the timeframe so if the packages have been misrouted, they will have time to get there.<br /><br />The situation with &quot;tcbagby&quot; is a totally different scenario.<br /><br />We got this personal message on the forum from &quot;tcbagby&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I sent an order to them on Friday, May 31st and paid for priority shipping.&nbsp; I expected the order to go out that day, or at least by 11 am the next day as they advertise.&nbsp; That was six days ago.&nbsp; when I checked the status of my order it says &quot;processing.&quot;&nbsp; I think the only thing that is being &quot;processed&quot; is my bitcoin I sent them.&nbsp; I have tried several times to get in touch with them, and no answer.&nbsp; Also, I can&#039;t log on to silkroad now my original name and password info, and have to open a new account with a new name and password to gain access.&nbsp; This is fast looking like a scam to me. <br /><br />Before I go postal and start spreading the word on the internet about them AND silkroad I thought I would&nbsp; try this.&nbsp; &nbsp;SEND MY ORDER OR REFUND MY BITCOIN&quot;<br /><br /><br />We messaged back &amp; forth a few times, &amp; then I noticed an order on the &quot;pending&quot; shelf with the user name &quot;tcbagby.&quot;<br />Started some wheels turning so went to message him on SR, &amp; low &amp; behold there had been a message from him several days before which was why the order was on the &quot;pending&quot; shelf all along!&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s his message he apparently forgot sending!<br /><br />tcbagby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hety bro please DO NOT SEND the order I placed with you to the address I sent. I will give you a new address to send it to in 2-3 days. Please tell me if you have already sent it to the address I gave you.<br />This is the order: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account/view_transaction/632f6aa6a5<br />Sorry for the hassle bro, I fucked up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read<br />delete<br /><br />So for doing as he asked, we get dumped on &amp; accused of scamming!<br />We have not heard from him since &amp; have left messages through the forum, SR, or Tormail.<br /><br /><br />So if a package has not been received in a timely manner, we still will ask that the customer wait &amp; give USPS a chance to redeem themselves since a small percentage are taking way too long to get delivered, there&#039;s no money in scamming anyway if you are planning to stay around (which we are).&nbsp; The other silly bit is we never ask anyone to FE, so it makes even less sense to be getting accused from that perspective!<br /><br />NCK

But is very annoying. And can be a problem if you are not sure about your password because it can lead to think you that your password is not correct, when it is.<br /><br />
