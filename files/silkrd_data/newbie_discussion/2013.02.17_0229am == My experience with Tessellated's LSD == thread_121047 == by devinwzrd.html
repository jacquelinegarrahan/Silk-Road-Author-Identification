				Hello, today I&#039;d like to talk about my night using Tess&#039; LSD, and how wonderful it was.<br />First I&#039;d just like to say that Tessellated is as professional as they come. He/she/they were willing to answer any questions I had, and that means a lot to me. I tend to question a lot of things, just because I like to know what I&#039;m getting myself into.<br />Now, prior to this trip, I had only done knock offs such as DOI and 2ci. My reason for doing those was they were passed off to me as LSD. This trip was my first experience with clean, genuine LSD, and it was wonderful. I purchased 2 hits of it when he still sold them like that, and I gave the other hit to a friend. We popped them under our tongues around 10:30 pm. The effects began slowly kicking in around 11:30. I first noticed the colors I could see became very vivid. I have christmas colored lights around the top borders of my bedroom, so this was a magnificent sight. I then switched on a playlist I had crafted of music I thought would connect to me on a different level. I was spot on, as I could literally feel the music flowing through me. It was majestic. &quot;The rhythm of life.&quot; While the music played in the background, my friend and I began just talking and exploring each other&#039;s minds. It felt extremely refreshing to talk to him about everything. I felt connected to him on a different level. This was his first time tripping so I was quite excited to see that he was enjoying it. We each had a couple miniscule self realizations that I don&#039;t think changed much. One reason I wanted to trip was to try to help myself get into the mindset of quitting cigarettes. I smoked two during the main 8 hours of the trip, and I felt disgusted by them. I plan on doing this every time I trip in hope of helping me quit. After we talked a bit, we did our own thing for a little. I turned on my xbox and began playing Far Cry 3. I was astounded by the sights I could see. Everything was so vivid and beautiful. I got sucked into the game and literally drove a car in game around for about a half hour and just admiring the sights I could see. As I&#039;d drive, the grass and trees would slowly appear and it just did really well to my eyes. After I stopped playing the game, we talked a little more, and then we just began watching movies and tv. We first watch The Holy Mountain and that was just crazy, lol. The come down to the trip was really gentle. It just kinda set me down on a cloud and I just loved it. In the morning, around 8, we were still up so we decided to go to breakfast at a local diner. After that, we chilled for a little longer and then we both just went to bed. When I finally woke up, I felt really refreshed. That night was exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Overall, I&#039;m extremely pleased with the overall quality of the lsd. Tess is a wonderful person who provides a wonderful product and a lot of support. I completely recommend him for your lysergic desires.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.
