				So here&#039;s the dealio dragoncove up and quit while I had an order in escrow for his 1 gram listing of #4 Afghanistan heroin. I did not finalize as I&#039;ve been buying on the road for over almost 2 years. But I checked the escrow on the account tab and it doesn&#039;t show the money in coin or USD as being in escrow. He hasn&#039;t marked the order in transit so of course I&#039;m going to cancel once the allotted time is reached. My main question is my money already lost since it&#039;s not showing up in escrow or am I just being paranoid? I&#039;ve never had this problem before as I&#039;ve never come across this issue. Any info would be much appreciated. Thank you

				How long until resolution center is available?<br />I recommend waiting until then and creating a ticket explaining to the SR staff what you just said here<br />Since he is out of commission and didnt send your package you will get coin back, you just will have<br />to wait a little while

				Some time late Monday is when I can cancel so the resolution center should be ready by then. But the main thing I was wondering is normally when I cancel an order I get all my money back unless it hedged then I lose 5% which is totally acceptable with me. Will I still get my money back if I cancel the order even though the money isn&#039;t showing up in escrow? I would very much like to not have to go into resolution because I don&#039;t want this to ruin my scoring seeing as it&#039;s near perfect. Thank you for your time.

				damn i did not think he was gonna end up stopping for sure.. he and I were tight and we chatted off and on.. he mention a while back he was tired of the hassle here.. He made good $ IRL long before SR... He sent me 2 grams for free, told me he wanted me to test them out to see if they were good product, it was at 2 diff times, i guess it was shit he was gonna sell and wanted to make sure it was fire..<br /><br /><br />of course it was..&nbsp; damn he actually owed me Half a G also, cause of a mix up order from while back...o well.. u wil get ur money bro.. u need to contact SR also though..it may not be as easy as going to resolution cause he hascashed out and closed the acct.. im not 100% but u may have to go through a wait.. iv been here close to 2 years as well OP.. i introduced dragoncove into the forums, and at 1 point he would not sell his H to anyone unless i sent them to mention it.. dude was weird but cool

				Well this fucking sucks I just FE&#039;d for a gram of H from DC cause I have had dozens of dealings with him and never had a problem. Thats what I get for being fucking nice. Guarantee I will never see the order now. Thats pretty sorry on his part. I will never FE even for a reputable vendor again because DC was the last person I thought would do something like this. Live and learn I guess.

				Fucck.&nbsp; Ordered 2 grams of heroin on Monday; in transit Tuesday. His orders ALWAYS arrive 2-3 days after to should have been here Thursday Friday. It&#039;s Sunday and if I&#039;m not seeing anything Monday it looks like this POS Vendor took a shitload of orders knowing he was going to leave then just vanished. Now my money is going to be tied-up in escrow for who knows how long. Thanks DragonCove, way to treat your customers...
