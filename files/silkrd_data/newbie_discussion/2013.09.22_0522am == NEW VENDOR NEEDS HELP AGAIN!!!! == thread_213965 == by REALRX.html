				Did you enter 3 addresses?<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To minimize the time between when Bitcoins are credited to your account and when you are able to convert them to your currency of choice, and therefore minimize your exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, we provide an auto-withdrawal feature. If you enable this then once your account balance reaches a minimum of à¸¿1.00 your entire balance will automatically be withdrawn to three Bitcoin addresses of your choice. This feature can be enabled on your settings page.<br /><br />A note of caution: it is possible for an adversary to discover your auto-withdrawal address by looking for a transaction in the block-chain around the time they finalize a transaction with you for an amount similar to what they paid you (adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations if hedging). To help obscure your withdrawals, you must enter three withdrawal addresses. Your withdrawal will then be made in 3 random sized chunks to these three addresses with a small, random delay in-between them. These addresses can all be on the same wallet or exchange account so you don&#039;t have to keep track of multiple wallets. This will help them blend in to all of the other transactions, but you should change your withdrawal addresses regularly so that an adversary can&#039;t see any patterns over multiple transactions.<br /><br />Pro-tip: set your auto-withdrawal addresses to deposit addresses at an exchange site and keep an open sell order there that is below the market rate, so as soon as the funds are confirmed there, they will be converted into your currency of choice.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide
