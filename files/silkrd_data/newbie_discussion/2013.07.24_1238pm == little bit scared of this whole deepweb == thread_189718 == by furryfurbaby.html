				Hey I&#039;m new as you can tell but I&#039;m not only new to the deepweb but basically the internet. Only really been on since 2010 and that was mostly social networking and google.<br />All my friends come to me for their computer problems because I like to learn and explore so I have the most experience. <br /><br />Lately though I&#039;m finding it hard to remember things and I am scared of screwing up something or fucking up with this whole thing, I don&#039;t even know how too safely get bit coins and I can&#039;t really afford to lose money because I&#039;m supporting an arsehole and I&#039;m trying to get him off synthetic weed. (shut up, I love him and know it&#039;s pathetic)<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m in over my head here because I can&#039;t sit at a computer to fix most things because I suffer degenerative disc disease in my back and I have no idea what all this means.<br /><br />I have tor on my phone and I use that a lot, is that okay to start with? I also have it on my computer but my phone is much more comfortable. what about using onion browser on my ipad? <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty handy with jailbreaking and stuff like that, I understand most terms and if I don&#039;t I look it up and learn. I am just nervous on the deepweb and I&#039;m terrified of coming across kiddie porn or animal cruelty. I didn&#039;t know what CP stood for on the clean wiki and luckily I saw his hate mail before exploring the deepweb a bit more. <br />Basically I&#039;m here because I saw a special on TV about the black market and I wanted a phone but I saw most reviews said they&#039;re scams. I got one through other ways anyway but am I in over my head here if I wanted to get a certain drug I saw was awesome in a cracked article? <br /><br />this must really sound stupid...
