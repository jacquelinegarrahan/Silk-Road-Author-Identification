				I think Patriotism is a sense of affection for ones country more-so than ones government and is a good thing. Whereas Nationalism is a more radical approach.<br /><br />To me, Nationalism is nothing more than a convenient motivator to keep the people on-board with the states ambitions, however self-serving they may be and I think it&#039;s a way of surrendering ones conscience to the rulers of their country.<br /><br /><br />Laissez-faire!

				Patriotism is the phenomenon of adopting a familial metaphor towards the nation-state of which you are a member, such that various actions and declarations regarding that nation-state parallel the actions and declarations expected of person toward his or her parents. In English the metaphor operates off the relationship with the father, in other languages it may operate off the relationship with the mother.<br /><br />Or I guess you could say it&#039;s a bigger version of the whole my tribe vs. your tribe thing. Whatevs.

				Patriotism is the love of your geographical area and caring for the freedoms first and only then well being of others within that area. In essence general compassion without letting yourself be walked on by others and taking care of the land you inhabit. The goal is to liberate man from any tyranny and give him a better life of his choosing.<br /><br />Anyone who wraps it up in politics doesn&#039;t get it or is trying to use you for nationalistic political agendas. 99% of the time a Patriot should combat their government and make it as dysfunctional as possible. Anymore this would seem to include corporations too. The end goal of any state is complete tyranny and power the purpose of the Patriot is to subvert their reckless and manipulative actions. Makes me mad when people actually believe you have to love your government to be a Patriot. But of course that&#039;s what the people in their sand castles want you to believe. It&#039;s caring about the people and freedom not a flag or lines or faces.<br /><br />DPR seems to be akin to a Patriot whether he would call himself one or not.
