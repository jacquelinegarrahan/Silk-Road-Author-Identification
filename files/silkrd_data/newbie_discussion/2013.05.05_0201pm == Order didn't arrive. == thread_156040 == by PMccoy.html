				Hi all<br /><br />Bit worried about an Order i made on Wednesday. I FE&#039;d the moment it was marked as in transit, it was 28g of thai, i was told by the vender it was going to be sent out 1st Class Royal Mail Recorded next day. Its Sunday, and it didn&#039;t arrive and i have been unable to make contract with the seller. <br /><br />My main concern is that the Royal Mail may have picked it up, but the vender hasn&#039;t provided me with the tracking numbers so i can see whats happening with it. I&#039;ve taken the steps of removing everything incriminating from my property but i am now in a state of paranoia. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried contacting the vender via both tormail addresses he has advertised and sr. <br /><br />Advice please

				Well i am brand new to SR, and 90% of venders want people with less then 10 transactions to FE. This vender is in the top 10% and requires EVERYONE to FE

				When was it marked in transit?<br /><br />If by chance it went in the post on Friday (which is possible, as &quot;in transit&quot; doesnt really mean its already been posted - sometimes I find my stuff gets posted a day or two after it gets that status), then you wouldn&#039;t necessarily receive it Saturday. <br /><br />Recorded isnt guaranteed next day, unless its special delivery, which from your description it sounds like it wasnt. 9/10 times recorded does show up the next day, however, In my experience this only seems to work on week days. Its like they dont bother sorting shit on Saturdays.<br /><br />See where you&#039;re at on Tuesday maybe :(<br /><br />Does the vendor have a review thread? You&#039;ll probably get your answers there regarding how reliable they are.

				I am in a similar situation, i had an order sent out last Wednesday by 1st class royal mail which i FE for because the vendor asked because me two because of the attacks on silk road. I havent received it yet. I have had many orders uk to uk and they have taken 2 days at the most i am worried because it is a fairly big order and a lot of money to me.&nbsp; Do you guys think i should be panicking

				My main concern isn&#039;t if the vender has not sent the package and mugged me off, its if Royal mail have seized it. <br /><br />The lack of communication is silly, I asked for tracking numbers, on Thursday since it was a large amount of thai. <br /><br />I&#039;ve emailed him using both Tormail addresses provided, and silk road messages several times. Not an whisper from him. <br /><br />I just want a pre warning that i may face some difficult questions from plod next week.

				That sucks. Don&#039;t forget it&#039;s a bank holiday tomorrow though. The earliest your package can arrive now is Tuesday.

				In my case the vendor has replied but just told me to wait. I FE because he has 100 feedback seemed genuine and all of his other customers were FE at the time. Has any one else ever had a item sent to them 1st class royal mail taking longer than 3-4 days.

				You guys need to realize that when a vendor marks something as &quot;in transit&quot;, he doesn&#039;t actually ship it out until it&#039;s finalized (if they expect FE). Once it&#039;s marked in transit, a vendor might not even log in to see that you finalized it until a day or two after the fact. Unless both parties is constantly refreshing SR to check orders 24/7, there is always going to be a delay.

				Looks to me like you learned a lesson about the road. Stay away from FE, and stay away from vendors who require it for all.
