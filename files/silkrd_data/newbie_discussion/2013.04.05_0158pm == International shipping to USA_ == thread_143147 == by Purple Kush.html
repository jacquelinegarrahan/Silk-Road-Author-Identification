				Hey everyone, i have a question about getting things shipped to the USA from other countries. How risky is it? Which items are the best to send internationally? I was planning on purchasing some ketamine, mdma, lsd, and other rc&#039;s from Europe because it is so much cheaper. <br /><br />Also, which vendors can you recommend to ship the above items internationally to the us?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Purple Kush

				I have gotten some MDMA and K from Europe.<br /><br />Shipping can take several weeks and you should measure time in working days, so do not count weekends. Of course the risk is much higher and it is more likely that drug dogs will scan your package. Of all the things you listed, MDMA is most likely to be found.&nbsp; I know LSD is undetectable to drug dogs.&nbsp; RC&#039;s and K, I am not sure, but probably not.<br /><br />I assume for MDMA you will be using a Dutch vendor?&nbsp; Find one who launders through another country if possible.&nbsp; Holland is a flagged country and will receive extra attention from customs.&nbsp; Although I have gotten product with a Dutch return address in my case ordering MDMA.

				One of the main factors is which state you live in. Packages sent to the east coast have a much higher rate of success than those sent to the midwest. A lot of companies won&#039;t even ship to states in the midwest. If you don&#039;t live on the east coast you can set up a remailer service. They give you an address, receive the package for you, and forward it to you.
