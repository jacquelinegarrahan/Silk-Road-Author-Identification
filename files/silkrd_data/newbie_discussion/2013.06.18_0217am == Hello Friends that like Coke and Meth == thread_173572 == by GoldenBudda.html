				&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello new friends I am a new Coke and Meth Vendor. All of my products are pure and uncut. I&#039;m sure you guys hear that all the time but I can guarantee that my products will be the best in SR history. I would like to hear what the best way to get my samples out to you guys would be. I have my stealth shipping down. Please give me some advice since I do not have any history on here. I will offer 2 free sample of .5 meth and .5 Blow for lucky 2 people if they promise to write a review of them and help spread my name.

				i can do a review, but you have to be a vendor. or no deal<br /><br /><br /><br />i have much experience with cocaine and meth.&nbsp; more coke then meth, but we don&#039;t get alot of good meth around here.&nbsp; and you can only get it from creepy, gay guys.

				you have to erase the metadata.<br /><br />take the pic, as a jpeg, convert it to bitmap, then back to jpeg.&nbsp; that should do it.<br /><br /><br />if you want me to sample, please let me know.&nbsp; but you should do custom listings for the people you choose, so it shows in feedback.

I have been looking through the vendors on SR and the repressed keys they are trying to pass along as pure virgin what a joke. I am about to blow your guys minds! Only one spot left for meth! Product is free as long as buyer pays shipping and leaves a honest review.
