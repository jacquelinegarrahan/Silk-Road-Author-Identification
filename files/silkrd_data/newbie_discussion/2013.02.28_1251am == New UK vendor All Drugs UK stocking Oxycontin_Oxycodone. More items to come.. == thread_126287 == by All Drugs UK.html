				Hey &#039;All Drugs UK&#039;,<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d post up a lil thank you note &amp; review of the 1x 20mg oxycontin OC I ordered from you..<br /><br />(Ratings out of 10)<br />Item: 10 (Was precisely what I expected to receive, in perfect condition &amp; of very high quality)<br />Shipping: 10 (Can&#039;t beat free postage. Ordered Sunday night, posted Monday, arrived Wednesday)<br />Packaging: 10 (Perfect stealth packet with the item packaged so you couldn&#039;t feel it through the packet and made no noise)<br /><br />So my overall rating is: 10/10! :D .. You really do provide a top notch service and I look forward to doing more business in the future :)

				All Drugs UK -&gt; My favorite &amp; highest rated SR vendor by miles!! <br /><br />Communication&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 5/5<br />Prices &amp; P+P&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 5/5<br />Dispatch &amp; Delivery Time = 5/5<br />Item Quality&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = 5/5<br /><br />Every order I&#039;ve placed has been dispatched &amp; delivered to me within one or two working days. Stealthily packaged every time, guaranteeing your item arrives in perfect condition. Obviously you always get what you&#039;ve paid for - every item is the real deal (no cheap knockoff brands) and of the highest quality.<br /><br />All Drugs UK has proven himself to be a top class SR Vendor and because of his efficiency and reliability he will continue to be the main vendor I order from and would highly recommend him &amp; his items to everyone on the Road!<br /><br />(Formally)B48Smoker

				Hi <br /><br />Could someone please tell me how many 20mg Oxy&#039;s I would need in order to obtain a gratifying sensation of well being and euphoria???<br />I am on 75mg of methadone and have been for a long time so I am not opi-oid\ate naive by any means.&nbsp; How would one ingest the said medication.<br />I am not keen on snorting or injecting this substance.&nbsp; I believe this can be chased on foil?&nbsp; Would one wash the outer coating first, crush it up or<br />simply stick it on the foil and toot away?&nbsp; Thank you in advance.<br /><br />Ruuuu
