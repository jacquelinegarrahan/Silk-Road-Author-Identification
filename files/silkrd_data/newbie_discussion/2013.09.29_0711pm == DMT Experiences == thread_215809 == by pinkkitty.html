				Hello everyone, I am very new to the SR forums.&nbsp; I just wanted to create a thread in the Newbie section where people could share experiences and knowledge they have gained throughout their travels through the cosmos.<br /><br />First, I would like to tell my favorite DMT experience.&nbsp; Sadly, the experience has faded in my memory a lot over time.&nbsp; Anyways,&nbsp; I smoked the pure DMT in about 3 inhales between some herb.&nbsp; Just like every other time the world began to vibrate in an odd way and I knew I was there.&nbsp; I put down my pipe, lie down and shut my eyes.&nbsp; The experience has faded some over time, but I remember I met a pink cat lady.&nbsp; She was so nice and happy to see me.&nbsp; She showed me soooo many things in such a short time.&nbsp; I substantially remember seeing all the religious symbols in a circle, all intertwined, connected, and spinning.&nbsp; It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life.&nbsp; After that, I randomly remember seeing pyramids.&nbsp; I opened my eyes after this, and the experience was over except for slight visuals.<br /><br />Next, I would like to tell about my most recent DMT experience.&nbsp; This one was not as substantial to me.&nbsp; I did not focus enough, and I feel I didn&#039;t pay attention to the lot of knowledge that was given.&nbsp; I smoked the DMT once again, and the vibrations happened once again.&nbsp; I shut my eyes, and I went to this sort of psychedelic library.&nbsp; The walls were beautiful changing colors of orange and red.&nbsp; The beings gave me a tour, but we were flying through so fast I couldn&#039;t take all the beauties in.&nbsp; I opened my eyes part of the way through (I do this sometimes just to make sure I&#039;m still in my home) and my whole vision was sky blue.&nbsp; I closed my eyes once again, and I couldn&#039;t make out the library well anymore, but thousands of beings reached out to me with red beam like arms and touched my third eye area on my forehead(where the pineal gland is).&nbsp; I opened my eyes after this and saw slight rays of energy coming from the ceiling which was cool. This subsided soon and I was very sad I didn&#039;t pay better attention.<br /><br />I believe DMT is such a beautiful molecule and everyone should try it at least once.&nbsp; Thanks for reading 2 of my experiences.&nbsp; Anyone and everyone post their experiences with this food of the gods, and their travels through the invisible landscape!

				Describing trips for me is sort of like telling people about dreams. It&#039;s almost one of those &quot;you had to be there moments&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ll never forget the last lesson that DMT taught me, which was that I should ALWAYS put up my bong out of sight when not in use, and to dump the water every time as well.<br />I can never explain WHY that seemed so important, but I can tell you that DMT has always had a &quot;lesson&quot; to teach me each time I tried it.<br /><br />Again, I can&#039;t tell you what I learned, but every time I try it all of my priorities get sorted out and I can see how my life has purpose and everything is clear. I can feel the infinite potential in myself and others.

				I completely agree with you about it being difficult to describe DMT trips and they&#039;re like dreams.&nbsp; The dreams I remember are always so fast and so scattered, it is just like my DMT experiences.&nbsp; Also, just like dreams my DMT experience themes usually relate to what has been going on in my life.&nbsp; I hate trying to tell my old friends and family about my DMT experiences.&nbsp; It is so hard and they seem so ignorant, and that is part of the reason I created this thread.&nbsp; I feel DMT has so much knowledge to give if we can focus really hard and take it all in.&nbsp; I also agree on you&#039;re last statement.&nbsp; After I smoke DMT I feel connected to the universe in a way I cant explain...&nbsp; I feel I have a purpose in life.&nbsp; Even after some of the most odd or silly trips it always leaves me feeling this way.&nbsp; I love DMT!&nbsp; However, I try to respect the molecule by smoking it only once a week at most and only when the time feels right.&nbsp; Sometimes I go much longer without it even though I miss that place it takes me so much...
