				I only want to say that you can trust OldAmsterdam! My first small order was in December 2012, i had to FE.<br />Since then i ordered a couple of times, FE and without FE, different quantities but not more than 50g at once.<br />Every time the product and packaging was excellent and i also choose different colors of MDMA crystals. A friend of<br />mine tested a charge at a labor in Vienna, the result was 839mg/g! Without bad additives. Exactly what OA says 84%.<br />One time it took a little longer, but that is because OA is really busy. One time i ordered a little amount of Ketamine (also good quality)<br />which arrived two days after auto-finalize, really late. But at that moment OA allready gave me discount on next order! I massaged<br />him and now we are even again. I really don&#039;t think OA is a selective scammer. Believe me, OA wants to make business,<br />he likes his customers. The communication always was nice and he answered my questions within a day.<br />And never forget that a couple of packages get caught by officials of different countries. That&#039;s the only risk.<br />Because even the best packing does not help against random checks.<br /><br />I hope this post helps customers to lose their fear of getting scammed.<br />There are some bad rumors here in the forum which in my opinion are untrue.<br /><br />I will order again. OA is close to the source and the sassafras oil, for sure.<br />Best Quality guaranteed!<br /><br />Will update pictures soon!!

				I have made two orders of MDMA with OldAmsterdam, and both of them have been successful.<br /><br />MDMA quality is top notch, the packages took a little bit longer than usual (15 days)

				Let me tell you my experience with OA, he was my first MDMA vendor and he will be my very last! Yes, he did have some delays in December-January however the problems have been fixed! I just got my 500gram order with me safe and sound. Moving forward with the product, it has always been consistent and top notch but this new white batch is FIREEEEEEEEEE!!! Can&#039;t be more satisfied, thanks OA for always pulling through!
