				Hi all. <br />Really appreciate some help here. <br />I&#039;ve setup a MtGox account which appears to only allow you to have an account once been verified (by sending in personal ID).<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve since got verified and now found out these BTC&#039;s are now linked to me/MtGox working with the DEA etc.... <br />thus logically last thing you want to do is transfer these to SR as they will be traceable.<br /><br />Q&#039;s - <br />Is MtGox effectively obsolete to SR buyers now? Or can they somehow be used still?<br />What is the other best option for Australia?<br />Thanks in advance!

				Bitinnovate for sure, other option online is to get through Virwox, which u can fund from a neteller or paypal account, but it&#039;s a real fuck around. By the time you register with both, fund neteller, buy second life linden dollars ( yep no shit, some people have a virtual life WTF?) through virwox and exchange them for btc and pay transaction fees on every single one of those transactions, then find u &#039;triggered virwox fraud algorythm&#039; so u must wait 48 hours for btc to go through, u might as well have ordered through bitinnovate, gone to the bank and received ur coin in a couple of hours. ( unless of course u enjoy tedious assholes who want all ur info and the &#039;thrill&#039; of trying to figure out wtf is a virtual life!<br />I&#039;m not jaded!

				I can vouch for bit innovate - From depositing at the bank to the funds appearing in my wallet only one hour had passed.
