				Do any of you use Bitcoin Fog or another laundry service before sending your BTC to SR?&nbsp; Why/Why not?<br />I used Bit Instant &gt; Bitcoin wallet and am thinking of sending it straight over to SR from there, but am unsure about what kind of digital paper trail this leaves.<br />Thanks guys,<br />halleo

				Seriously? No one has an opinion on this? Or maybe this is a taboo subject as LE is likely monitoring these boards... Hmmm. &quot;the plot thickens.&quot;

				Lots of people have an opinion, but they have been expressed in the countless other threads on this subject. <br />tl;dr = bitcoinfog is an extra precaution. If you want one, use it. Silkroad also tumbles.

				Pretty much exactly what Humplehippo said, most people don&#039;t really see the need to tumble their BTC as SR tumbles before it goes into your account, also if you are anonymously obtaining BTC there is no worries to be had about tumbling it as you never left a trail back.

This way you are benefiting SR as well as your fellow users. Win win.

				How safe is it to use a mixing service (bitcoinfog, blockchain.info, etc.) to scrub bitcoins which have not been obtained anonymously?
