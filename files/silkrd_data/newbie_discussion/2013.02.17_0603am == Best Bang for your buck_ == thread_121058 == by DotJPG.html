				A few vendors have some specials for methylone going on right now, and there&#039;s a lot of very reasonably priced pot on SR. One vendor has 1,4-BDO 2 FL OZ at a great price, which I would have purchased yesterday if I&#039;d received a reply message in time, but alas! My coinage is gone!<br /><br />These are just a few up my alley, really no matter what your DOC is you can find at least somewhat reasonably priced options, unless your DOC is coke ;)

				25--nBOME is a very potent psychedelic, nearly as potent by weight as LSD,usually sold on SR in blotter form. Methylone is also called bk-MDMA and is basically MDMA with cathinone instead of amphetamine. Anyone who&#039;s done MDMA before will notice it lacks the magic, but it&#039;s still a killer high. 1,4-BDO is called also 1,4-Butanediol and is a prodrug of GHB, and by some process may be converted to GHB I imagine, but is best taken as is. 25-i will cost you around $1-2 per dose, methylone will run you right now about $75 for 5g, whhich is anywhere between 20 and 50 doses, depending on how much you need to get off. the 1,4-BDO is about $65 for 30 ish doses. 25i will give you the most doses per dollar, but if you intend on selling these I&#039;d recommend you let people on to the fact that it isn&#039;t LSD ;)

				You might want to bookmark erowid.org, as well. You should definitely know the dosages, dangers, etc of the drugs you&#039;re taking and ESPECIALLY those you&#039;re selling. Misrepresenting the drugs you&#039;re planning to sell can and has in the past led to fatalities. Use common sense and common decency in your business ventures, or you&#039;re setting yourself up for failure :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a friend currently serving time for selling misrepresented drugs that ended up in a customer losing his life, he&#039;s been locked up for about 10 years now :/

				hahah guys relax, im not a moron.. i know my drugs, im just not big on the reasearch side of things, if i where to get 2ci i would never falsify information saying it was acid.. ive heard horror stories of that&nbsp; <br /><br />i think im going to get some 2ci after researching it, sell it for around 5 a pop and since its so cheap give the first couple out for free to see how people like them (my town is huge into hallucinogens) <br /><br />i was also looking at the mdma on here and its fucking ridiculously cheap. ive found a g for about 54 bucks with shipping included, anyone find anything cheaper?
