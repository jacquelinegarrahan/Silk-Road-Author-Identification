				Product Quality This is by far the most important so ill start with this. I don&#039;t have a previous experience to compare against but I can say that this exceeded all my expectations that arose from the vast amount of research I did on this drug. I can say this with certainty it was far more euphoric, less anxious, less paranoid, and much more visual stunning then the vast amounts of LSD I&#039;ve done in my lifetime. The blotter art it came on was really really cool as well. Trip lasted about 4-5 hours and only took about 30 minutes before I felt effects.<br />Stealth/ Packaging Perfect. Definitely don&#039;t have to worry if ordering domestic/ internationally. Took 2 days from being marked in transit to Midwest.<br />Communication/ Customer Service Let me share my story. This was my first purchase out of two with vendor. This experience started by me reading an article about 25c-Nbome and instantly I became intrigued by this relatively new substance. I did a search on SR and saw this vendor offering a 5 tab sample for $1.05 including free shipping. My bitcoins were absolutely depleted and due to my current goto guy from localbitcoins being out I was going to have to wait a week or so before getting more. I wrote Silo and asked him if he could waive the $1.05 so I could get to try sooner. In complete disbelief a half hour later I saw a message and $1.05 in my account haha. He ha actually sent me the money to buy the sample from him! Lol I felt like a bum but wow I never seen a vendor do that! In his message he informed me his &quot;family&quot; has been selling this chemical for years and sold hundreds of thousands of tabs over the years and now trying their luck at selling on the Silk Road. He also stated that he&#039;s giving out samples because he knows once people sample his product he was certain he would make customers for life! He was right!! I only wish he had more products but supposedly he&#039;s working on that as well! Xanax bars, medicinal and mid grade weed!! I can&#039;t wait, I mean I he starts selling products I use on a daily level like benzos, weed, and MDMA I wouldn&#039;t bother going through anyone else. I asked a few more questions in another message and he responded with an hour. Extremely polite and makes you feel like your his number one priority!!<br />Overall This guy will be goto guy for anything he sells that I use. 25c-NBOME is not a substance I would use very often that&#039;s why I hope he comes with new products soon. I say if you like Xanax definitely keep an eye on Silo when he finally offers his bars knowing him he&#039;ll probably be giving out free samples or ridiculously low prices so become a fan now! Also he still has the samples for 25c for $1.05 get over there quick and order yours!

				25c I&#039;d describe as almost purely visual. Mild euphoria, but crazy fractal visuals. Great for looking at stylized art or abstract art. Shitty for looking at nature, and no real enhancement of any sense other than the visual.
