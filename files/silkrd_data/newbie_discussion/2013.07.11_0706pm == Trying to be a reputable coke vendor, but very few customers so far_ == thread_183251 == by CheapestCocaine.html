				I dont really have enough to offer free samples, but I could create stealth listings for discounted smaller bags??<br /><br />I have the cheapest coke on SR! And at half the price, its nowhere near half the quality! Please check my vendor page and place an order! First user to buy TWO grams gets 0.5g FREE!<br /><br />I currently have zero feedback and am looking to build up my reputation and customer base. Pretty new to this.<br /><br />Please message me if you&#039;re interested or have any questions!

				I am by no means an expert in marketing, but I think your username might have something to do with it. Coke is generally a high brow drug, so the use of the word &#039;cheapest&#039; in your name may turn people off as they fear it may be cheap because it is cut heavily.<br /><br />As I said though, I am not an expert! I was just throwing my initial thoughts out there.<br /><br />best of luck with the venture, I hope it goes well for you :)

If it&#039;s any good at all, I&#039;m sure you will do well. There&#039;s definitely a market for cheap coke. I recently bought some from Licentia for $80 and was about what I expected. He&#039;s a new vendor that&#039;s doing pretty well.<br /><br />I know you said you don&#039;t have too much, but honestly the best thing you can do is samples. Try to get to 50 posts, go to the cocaine thread, and offer quarter gram samples for like $10 to people that have been around for a while. You lose a little bit of money, but it will really pay off if the coke is decent.

				I would advise you to make a list of what&#039;s important to the people who will be buying from you and tailor your business to that model.&nbsp; People here want excellent customer service, honesty, good product at a fair price, good communication, and respect.&nbsp; If you make those 5 things the pillars of your business model the rest will take care of itself.

				Even as a newb user, I can see that people on SR seem to go back to the same seller that they trust every time. If you really want people to start buying from you, you&#039;ll have to give an extremely good price and (as said) cheap samples to gain traction.

				You sell it for $60/gram as is, so all you&#039;re doing is selling smaller quantity for the same price.&nbsp; You should offer .25G samples for $20 or just send out a select # of &quot;freebies&quot; to people with a lot of posts who will review your product.&nbsp; People tend to like free shit, so you&#039;ll generally get good reviews.

				Cant afford freebies right now! Just took out one hell of an investment to fund this. Thanks for the advice everyone. I will definitely follow all of it. Except for the free samples for now lol. 0.2g listings up.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/e064eb3d85<br /><br /><br />And I think I might completely abolish overnight shipping altogether. I really dont like walking into the post office with cameras glaring at me. Is there any way I could do overnight using the USPS bluebox?

				Just my $.02, but I would never send my address over silk road unencrypted, and I see you don&#039;t have a PGP key set up.&nbsp; That alone would keep me from buying from you.<br /><br />good luck, Im sure once you get a few reviews things will pick up.<br /><br />

				i think that you need a PGP key as stated before also you should buy some testing kits and show to potency of your product in the pic of the product. Your prices look good and if you are in the 60% pure range you can get a lot of business but with your name and no way to know the potency a lot of people will think your coke is super stepped on. I would buy from you if I know I was getting decent product for that price.

				As a new user, I tend to put a lot of trust in threads where experienced members have done chemical analysis and bioassay of the product.&nbsp; LSD avengers is a beautiful example.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a cocaine avengers thread but to me that would be the best place to break in.&nbsp; I doubt giving out random samples would be effective, but giving samples to an experienced and well-respected forum member would be money well spent IMO.&nbsp; &nbsp;That, and be nice to newbies :(

				Hey CC you seem like a cool guy who is eager to make a name for yourself.<br />I think that you have a lot to learn as well as prove yourself. I myself have a hard time trusting new vendors who are offering a high quality drug as cocaine and so are probably many others.<br />If you can afford it, I would suggest sending in a sample to this guy<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0<br />He is doing unbiased purity tests and if your coke is really as good as you say it is, I would gladly buy from you mate.<br />It doesn&#039;t have to be as pure as columbian coke but it would be nice to know that it&#039;s not cut.<br />Just my 0.02 ฿
