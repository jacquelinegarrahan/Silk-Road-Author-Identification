			<dd class="postbody">
				I was just wondering if anyone else if having this problem? Whilst I have been using SR relatively frequently, this is my first post on the forums, as for quite some time I was unable to register a forum account. <br /><br />However, now that I have successfully (finally) registered an account here, I am still stuggling to reply to posts (and create this one). So I was just wondering if this is a common issue, and if there is anything that can be done to mitigate it? I understand that it may be a caching issue? As the Tor service is quite slow, whilst the captcha has a short time limit. Any other ideas?<br /><br />Thanks

				it&#039;s very infrequent to have a prob with a captcha. You can either reload the page, or request a new image. Also, they are not case sensitive and far as I can tell, never contain numerics.
