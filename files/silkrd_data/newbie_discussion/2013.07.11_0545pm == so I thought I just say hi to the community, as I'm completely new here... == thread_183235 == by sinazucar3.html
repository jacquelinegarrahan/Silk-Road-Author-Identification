				well, I said it above. Hi to anyone, and glad I found this place. to date, I&#039;m just browsing around, but stumbled upon some interesting stuff already. but now - on the risk of making everybody roll their eyes - how do I come across bitcoins? <br />I hope this doesn&#039;t disqualify me to make trade with anybody here - I&#039;m seriously completely unexperienced when it comes to this stuff. <br />thanks everybody for having me, <br />have a great day, wherever you are,<br />sinazucar

				Hey<br /><br />Last week I was a n00b. <br /><br />Now I&#039;m a jaded old timer.<br /><br />You buy BitCoins just about ANYWHERE EXCEPT here. You want a place that does ESCROW.<br /><br />&quot;Local Bitcoins&quot; and &quot;Speedy Bitcoin&quot; are good places to start your search.<br /><br />Enjoy brother, or sister.<br /><br /><br />

				Well hallo to you to.<br /><br />You will probably be flamed for asking about bitcoin, but that is mostly because a lot of people on here feel that you should be intelligent enough to figure this out for yourself! Think of it as an initiation test! If you cant figure it out, then you are probably not fit to be here in the first place!<br /><br />Anyway, ill give you a clue. <br /><br />The best way to obtain bitcoin can vary, depending on which country you are from, but usually there is a shitload of different ways!<br />Also, if you would care to use the search engine, there might be some info somewhere in the forum that is directly applicable to your circumstances.<br /><br />Hope you figure it out, and that thsi will turn out to be a positive experience for you.<br /><br />Just remember to do A LOT of research before doing anything!

				Yeah, like Candy says research before doing anything. If u feel u have a question try use the search option and I am sure sumthin will pop up :)<br />Another thing u want to get accustomed to is using PGP to encrypt your personal info and/or messages. Give it a search and u will find all the info u need :)<br />Good luck and enjoy the Road 8)

				Welcome and best wishes. Lots of good material on the forums, to be sure, but do some serious reading outside of the forums as well. Gain an understanding of the workings of bitcoin, Tor, and PGP encryption, not just as they relate to using SR. Once you understand how they work in essence, their application to SR will be clear to you.

Tumbling your coin means that you put them into a tumbler service, where they get mixed up with the coins from other members, and you exit, with a new set of coin.<br />This might be what you meant, just wanted to elaborate, to avoid misunderstandings.<br />

				Welcome! do not feel uneasy at asking any question this is a forum for discussion, everyone starts of in your situation... keep scratching the surface and all the information you need you will find. On the point about bitcoins.... Localbitcoins has not let me down and they have decent rates. Search for a user with near enough 100% feedback and you will be alright.<br /><br />then come and spend your coins down here ;-) we&#039;ve got some good Thai weed listings and coke up soon :<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9fddd412b1

				ok, so - THANKS everyone for your kind and lenient replies. I actually feared I&#039;d be flamed for posing a such obvious dumb question - and of course, there was that search option that ALWAYS slips my mind on whichever forum I start. I&#039;m truly sorry if I gave anybody a spot of high bloodpressure ;)...<br />and apologies (again) for taking so long to reply - I&#039;m not always on line, but do have a lot of other things to do in real life, as well. <br />I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll meet again in this forum, or some other thread of it. <br />until then, travel safely and be good! :)<br />
