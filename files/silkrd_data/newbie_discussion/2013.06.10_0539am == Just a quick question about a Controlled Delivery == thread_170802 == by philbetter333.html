				I was just reading through janetrenos thread on controlled deliveries and he was answering questions about shipping as he was an intern for USPS. Anyway, since I am still under 50 posts I couldn&#039;t ask my question. From what I read I pretty sure I might have gotten my answer but figured I&#039;d still ask.<br /><br />If the package is in your letter box/mailbox w/o it being signed than you are in the clear since it seems you have to sign for it, for LE to get a warrant, right? Seeing as anyone can send you a parcel, I don&#039;t see how you could get popped w/o someone approaching you personally about a package. From what JR said it seems as though you would be OK if the parcel was already in your mailbox w/o anyone approaching you or signing for it/claiming it.<br /><br />This makes me feel better about being prepared, because if I see my parcels in the mailbox and no one has approached me or left any notice on my door I can rest easy. But, if the parcel isn&#039;t in the mailbox and a postal worker comes knocking on my door asking me to sign for it or claim it, I can simply say &quot;I do not accept packages from unknown senders&quot;. That was a great thread JR made btw. Really helped me gain knowledge, and left me with a peace of mind knowing that ordering personal use quantities is pretty safe. Thanks to anyone who drops some knowledge/advice about this. I order a lot off e-bay as well as zappos and other online stores so I have many parcels coming to me at least every other week. I do keep a list of the addresses so I&#039;ll know what&#039;s what.<br /><br />Thanks guys

				Ok well never sign duh. but from my understanding there are instances of that not being enough. I remember reading on here a week or so back about some kid who was prosecuted in the US for having drugs mailed to them through a no signature delivery. According to the the thread and the OP, he said that it was the burden of the defendant to prove that someone might have malicious intent. Sounds like a f&#039;d up case tho. Also a tip if you really want to be safe then throw the package in your garbage (preferably outside your house, because i&#039;ve also heard of prosecutors saying &quot;since you didn&#039;t report/return/garbage package than that is evidence against you.

If the package arrives and requires a signature do yall literally just turn down the drugs you paid for? Or do you specifically message vendors before hand requesting that they send without a signature requirement?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Express packages from many countries have to require a signature.

				Ok&nbsp; so then what happens if you refuse the package at the door or just don&#039;t answer the door(it is a package that REQUIRES a signature). Will they bust down the door or just return the package to sender?

				The fact is no signature is required it does have to be handed to the person that is name on the package and whether the package is opened or not does not matter cause they already have a warrant and are coming in even if the the warrant is illegal. And whatever they find after the fact is chargeable.

				on days i&#039;m feeling paranoid, i have dropped mail in the trash with all the spam mail knowing the garbage won&#039;t be picked up for 5-6 days<br /><br />figure that gives me the best plausible denialbility if they do bust thru the door that night or the next day<br /><br />on refusing to sign for packages, one good excuse to not sign - &quot;sorry, but i got sued one time and the attorney used a delivery like this one, a sender i didn&#039;t recognize, that gave him his proof of delivery on the lawsuit service- i ain&#039;t going thru that again&quot; - something along those lines should serve

				Who the hell throws a package in the trash?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t make sense.&nbsp; Write &#039;return to sender&#039; on it and let it sit by the front door for a day.&nbsp; Also throwing away someone elses package is just rude (if it really was someone elses&nbsp; ::)).&nbsp; You might get charged with being a dick.

				cops can&#039;t give everyone a speeding ticket. so they look for someone going really fast, or swerving, or riding with tint on spinnas. keep tight, right, legit. work with vendors that know what they are doing.<br /><br />i have terrible addiction and need help. which... is&nbsp; truth. unfortunately more likely to get shot in my own home by swatpolice over weed than get medical help for addiction. yay.

I figured they were.&nbsp; But I was assuming so nasty criminal was sending narcotics to your house under your name then picking them up before you noticed so they wouldn&#039;t have to use their (the criminals) address.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, you got a package (that you ordered with your drugs in it), but, &quot;Oh no!&nbsp; I didn&#039;t order this!&quot;&nbsp; so you mark it return to sender then put it by your door and you&#039;ll take it back to the post office the next day so the mistake can be corrected.&nbsp; THEN, instead of taking it back to the post office... you get the drugs out and do them (or wait until an appropriate setting).<br /><br />I didn&#039;t miss anything did I?&nbsp; :D

				I can&#039;t understand what difference signing or not signing for a delivery would make. If someone mails you drugs, you&#039;re no less in possession of it because you don&#039;t sign for it. And as far as plausible deniability is concerned, wouldn&#039;t most people sign for a delivery addressed to them even if they weren&#039;t expecting something? Someone sends you a present, but you refuse the package and send it away because you didn&#039;t order anything lately? I doubt it. Something comes to the door with your name on it, most people would sign for it.<br /><br />So it would be helpful if we could figure out once and for all whether there&#039;s any legal advantage to not signing for stuff. Because if there is not, then vendors could just go ahead and ship orders with signature confirmation (as long as they were willing to pay the fee for it), and then all the disputes about tracking says something was delivered but the buyer says he never got it would be null and void. You signed for it, then you got it. Also, carriers will not leave items with signature confirmation on the porch or in the hallway of an apartment building or even in your mailbox, as they will with delivery confirmation, aka tracking. Some buyers are probably accused of trying to scam vendors when actually their shit was delivered and then stolen off the porch.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, Amazon will refund a buyer who says he did not receive an order, even if tracking (i.e. delivery confirmation) says it was delivered. But if signature confirmation is used, no refund will be given. Say what you will about Amazon (and I will say they are about as evil a bloodsucking giant monster of a multinational corporation as has ever plagued the Earth), but they&#039;ve got the whole buying shit on the Internet game pretty well figured out.<br /><br />Thanks for letting me share!
