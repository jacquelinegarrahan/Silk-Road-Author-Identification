				Looking 4 some advice how to stay away from &quot;radars&quot;. For now am using UK bank transfers to buy bitcoins, then i buy goods, sell them&nbsp; or whatever then come in bank and use deposit machine. so we look at around 600-1000 weekly. I think that&#039;s could be unsafe. can u give me advise , share some knowledge. what if they ask me how do i get that money? is there any safer way? UK only

				you need to be buying your bitcoins by doing over the counter cash deposit into the btc sellers bank account. i just replied explaining it in more detail in this thread<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=214788.0<br /><br />it doesn&#039;t require you to give your name or show any ID when you do a bank deposit so there are no records of the transactions in your name.

Making Â£500+ in cash deposits every week is going to raise flags very quickly. The information regarding laundering can be scarce, but I believe there are a couple of UK based vendors offering laundering consultancy services. StExo comes to mind, he&#039;s very knowledgeable in regards to legal and financial matters, it might be worth dropping him a PM.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				I&#039;m a newbie on these subjects, but I would try to put that money into a street business, such as a hot dog stand or something. Save for a bit, buy it, and then start declaring the money you&#039;re making along with the &quot;ilegal&quot; money.

There are probably ways to get around this, but I&#039;m not aware of them.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				open up a small hairdressers or nail salon or something like that. or even set up a window cleaning round. any kind of small service based business where people would mostly pay in cash is what you&#039;re looking for.
