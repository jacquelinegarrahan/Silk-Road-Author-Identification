				Why is this even a question?????? If you read anything that had to do with security on SR you would know to ALWAYS encrypt sensitive info such as your address. Besides the fact that it&#039;s senseless to have LE know your address, especially when getting drugs sent through the mail(a felony), it&#039;s also not safe for the sellers. If your address gets flagged than any packages getting sent there might get traced back to whatever postoffice they sent it from. PGP takes less than a minute to use to encrypt something. Learn it, use it. It&#039;s just safer for everyone that way.

				For the sake of your freedom encrypt!<br /><br />Do you really think that if they raid the silk road servers that they will just forgive all the buyers?<br /><br />They will have this big bust and no vendor addresses, and most buyer addresses will be encrypted. They will go after the unencrypted addresses and punish them extra for all the people they could not get.<br /><br />Remember the farmers market?<br /><br />It is not that hard. If you run windows google &quot;windows pgp tutorial&quot;, if you run another OS then replace &quot;windows&quot; with the name of your OS. It is a lot easier than spending time in jail.

If anything should happen to the site, or the vendor&nbsp; you are trying to purchase from then you are running a big risk of LE coming knocking.<br /><br />Many vendors won&#039;t serve you if you don&#039;t use PGP. If you are being lazy and won&#039;t learn PGP (your loss) there are a few vendors that will use privnote.<br /><br />I have been on the road 6 days, it took me a few hours one evening to download and learn PGP. Another few evenings to iron out the bugs and now I can keep my address away from prying eyes and keep the vendors happy.<br /><br />If no one used PGP imagine what a vendors inbox would look like...100s of addresses all readable and unencrypted. Not cool.<br /><br />It really doesn&#039;t take long to learn, apply yourself.<br /><br />Remember PGP, don&#039;t FE and stay frosty&nbsp; 8)

				This is stupid. Why wouldn&#039;t you encrypt? Its very easy, you can watch youtube videos that show you to do it. It takes about 5 minutes to learn how and about 1 minute to do. Don&#039;t be so lazy.

				First off:&nbsp; PINE!!!!! Welcome back!!!! much love and missed you!&nbsp; my fellow pgp enthusiast, where have you been ?&nbsp; Your absence has left an unencrypted hole in my digital heart.<br /><br />Secondly:&nbsp; ENCRYPT - why trust anyone?&nbsp; Silk Road and these forums are just a conduit for information,&nbsp; they provide a lovely service, but why would you trust any service provider with any of your personal information?&nbsp; Silk Road and other sites have no need to know what you are actually are saying, only the person you&#039;re dealing with directly need to know the details of your conversation.<br /><br />I&#039;ve created an onion, now linked to by several of the directories and wiki&#039;s in the onion patch, that has been well received and supported. It is several links to guides for encryption and a tool to test your encryption methods to make sure you&#039;re doing it correctly:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/<br /><br />Please feel free to browse this onion and if you have any suggestions on how to improve it, please drop me a line.<br /><br />Good luck to you all, stay secure, and happy hunting!<br /><br />-wicked

				I do not refuse buyers who do not use PGP, but I draw the line at privnote.<br /><br />If you use PGP then only I can read it.<br /><br />If you send plain text then only Silk Road and I can read it.<br /><br />If you send by privnote then privnote, Silk Road and I can read it.<br />
