				Hairytubes9/Tarmack19 keeps posting a fake Atlantis link, and as soon as people point it out, he deletes the thread and creates a new one, in an attempt to scam naive users!<br /><br />Stay away from his Atlantis link! I dont know if he is dumb enough to hope that someone with money in his Atlantis account will fall for it, or if he is hoping someone will use his fake site to create an atlantis account with same user and pass as Silkroad!<br /><br />No matter what his motives might be, he is a phishing cunt, and should have his knee-caps removed with a rusty spoon!

				Yeah, i realized that some ppl, were falling for it, so i have been trying to follow this cunt around, and make warnings in his threads for the last couple of days, but unfortunately i was a little late in catching up, and have been missing a few threads.<br /><br />Sorry this happened to you, but kinda lucky that it was a rather small amount.<br /><br />Things like this are a good reminder of why people should always use different passwords for different sites. I suggest the trick about having an adaptable password, where you might incorporate part of the site url in the password (without being to obvious), or something else, that is easy for you to remember.<br /><br />I really hate that this have to be necessary, but I&#039;m afraid that some people are just scum, and should have been killed before birth!
