				I have been researching an LSD vendor for my first purchase for the past week and one name that keeps coming up is Tessellated. Seems like he/she has some great clean stuff. a bit pricey, but all the positive feedback I have been reading can&#039;t be wrong!

				looking up buying an LSD test kit for a couple tabs a friend is getting me is actually what led me to SR. Wish I could get some off of here in time for the festival but not enough time to get BTC and get it shipped. Not as easy to find when you haven&#039;t looked for it in a few years.

				Hey guys, I&#039;ve got some some 25i NBOMe blotters coming up this week, any advice experienced users can give? Its my first time of course and i&#039;ll be getting 25 of them. I&#039;ve done lots of research on Erowid, drugs forums for some trip advice but would like some SR members to share their opinions and any tips :) they will be 1200ug per blotter, which I think is a lot, until i build up a tolerance of course. Should I cut the blotter in half and take half first, then the other about 30 mins - 1 hour later? or just cut them in half and put one in between my lips and teeth (where you put chewing tobacco) and the other half below the tongue? <br /><br />What do you guys think :)?

				Also I would add since you asked, that buccal administration seems to be the best for bioavailability and avoiding the chemical taste. Most people use this ROA or sublingual, although I would say that sublingual is more unpleasant in regards to the taste. I&#039;ve also had good results administering the blotters nasally.

				^It&#039;s kind of out of date right now. There&#039;s only a few of the vendors listed there that have any current listings. Obviously no offense to the Avengers. Just noting the reason why it seems hard to find a good vendor right now.

I would just leave it there, try my best not to swallow my saliva yeah?&nbsp; <br />http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Buccal_artery.png<br />I just want to be sure I properly get the NBOMe administered without waste, If not i&#039;ll just go for subliminally. Maybe both when I have a tolerance?<br />&nbsp;<br />oh and... NASALLY? did you just place a blotter in your nose and wait for a while? sounds like it would irritate the nose or cause a rash, we&#039;ll i wouldn&#039;t know and if it works it works! haha

				My understanding of buccal administration was that it was anywhere in between the gum and lip or cheek. Although you may be right technically. I think any of that will work. I usually keep it in my upper lip like you said before. <br /><br />Yeah I just stuck it up my nose. Whenever I tell people that they seem taken aback, but it seemed perfectly normal for me. No irritation or anything, and best of all no taste. The trip comes on very quickly, usually within 15 min, and then you can either fish it out, or I had one pass through my nasal cavity and I guess I swallowed it. Hard to say since I was tripping lol, but it definitely found it&#039;s way out of my nose. I&#039;ve also done this with acid blotters and liquid. It&#039;s a solid ROA in my experience.

				You know that&#039;s really interesting! I might give nasal administration a shot as well! i mean as I hear the taste can be quite off putting, unless it has a bad aroma, It should be alright!

It can also have a calming effect for some people if you start having a bad time (Its very unlikely you&#039;ll have a bad time though, it will be one the greatest times of your life)<br /><br />Also, some more personal advice, go for a quite large dose for your first time. Some people recommend 50ug-100ug for the first time, but i feel that is too small to get the full effect, and may leave you feeling disappointed, as it wont live up to expectation. I would recommend at least 200ug, maybe even 300ug if you feel confident. But, this is just my personal experience, if you&#039;re a rather anxious person when it comes to stuff like this (eg, if you have suffered from panic attacks from cannabis or something) go for the lower dose to see the genesis of the body/mind effects, then go for the higher dose

				I&#039;ve only ever ordered from OrderofThePhoenix and LOVE his stuff, though he&#039;s out now.<br /><br />Would love to try JackieChan or some of the others, but I really, truly am against FE, in principle. Perhaps someday. ;)<br /><br />I don&#039;t like mixing pot with my acid trips. It&#039;s the mind-clearing aspects of LSD that I love, combined with the multi-level thinking that happens. No reason to dull that out, though it does mean you have to experience the full intensity of the trip. Again, I like that, but I can grok why others may not ;)
