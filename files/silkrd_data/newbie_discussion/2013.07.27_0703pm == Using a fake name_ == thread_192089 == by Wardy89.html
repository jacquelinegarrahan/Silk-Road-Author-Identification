				Hey all,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR and just wondering if everyone uses a fake name when you have stuff posted to your address? I know it recommends to try and get it sent to a friends address or something but i can only get it sent to mine... So just wondering what the general protocal is when you have stuff sent to your own address?<br />

				Whoa! The first thing you should do is check out the user guide, or maybe a search in the forums using keywords. Do some research before asking these types of questions and you may find the answer for yourself. <br /><br />Hint - There is no right or wrong answer to this question. Your mileage may vary.&nbsp; It all depends on the quality of the stealth and your own paranoia.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I think it should very on your location... I can only speak for the US. Living in a large city and an apartment building with cluster-mailboxs I see no issue using a fake name as the post-person doesnt know anyone on a personal level, this might only become an issue if its a larger package and you arent around upon delivery and then have to go pick it up at the post-office. Having also lived in a small town I would avoid using a fake name as the post-person might notice a package with a name that has never been sent to a specific home. Just my two cents. <br /><br />p.s. I cant speak for the people at USPS but an acquaintance that works for ups says both delivery people and sorters have no issue keeping a package for themselves when they know there&#039;s drugs involved. I imagine this to be true as people Im sure would be rather apprehensive about claiming a stolen package when drugs are involved.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Use your real name. This is directly from a postal worker,&nbsp; &quot;Use real names! Our policy is to return mail that is not addressed to the occupant on file of a particular address, unless it&#039;s a known forward. So, if your carrier is doing what he&#039;s being paid to do, he will return a mail piece addressed to a a fake name every time.&quot;

				unless you can supply a fake ID to the postal workers, with the owner of the box, saying this person will be picking up mail from this box, pretty much its a bad idea.<br /><br />besides the whole idea is to keep everything simple and plane jane as possible, don&#039;t give them reasons to profile you as suspicious ;)

				Use your real name, send it to your house. stay anonymous, and clean your house often. RESEARCH your vendor before purchasing. A good vendor will make sure your products gets to you without arousing suspicion!

				Just research vendor make sure packaging is good and send to you real name to avoid any hassle. Imagine if something went wrong and you had to go to the post office to collect a parcel with a fake name. Fuck that
