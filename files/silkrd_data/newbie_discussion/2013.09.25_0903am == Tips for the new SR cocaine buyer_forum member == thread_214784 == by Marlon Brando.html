				So your first few days/weeks/months on SR and the forums can be a hell of a ride with a ton of emotion that&#039;s both scary and exciting. When it comes to making your first snow purchase I advise all would be snorters to first look domestically (the first time having this drug sent to a mail box can be nerve racking to say the least) This will alleviate some of the stress as now your product passes through less hands and less detection methods.<br /><br />For your first cocaine order I would suggest you look at the vendors who have been around the longest and or look to have the most professional attitude towards their customers. It can make the first transaction a lot more smooth and without any hiccups that can cause a first time buyer to feel uneasy and anxious, things we are looking not to do when you buy something from SR. It should be straightforward and without hassle. So do a bit of reading into the recent vendor reviews and make an informed decision based on what you&#039;ve learned. Also please remember to look at the most recent reviews when wanting to find about a products strength, as the vendors inventory will constantly be changing and you may be mislead into buying something that you did not want. Looking at past reviews can also be helpful in verifying that the vendor is without any big incidents and that the customers are happy with their purchase.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I recommend buying small in the .5g/1g range as this is still enough product to be able to make an accurate judgement but also small enough to not waste money if it doesn&#039;t live up to your expectations or becomes a piece of lost mail. Shit happens with mail and it&#039;s a fact we can&#039;t control. Also if you are willing it can be beneficial to you as a user to put in a few orders from different vendors as to get a taste for what&#039;s out there and to measure against other reviews of the same product to see if you are on the same page or if you share similar feelings and opinions on a certain product with another forum member, if you do, it can be nice to look at their other recommendations on gear which can help you choose a vendor that sells product YOU want to do. Not what everyone else wants, you are buying this for your own tastes (unless that is this isn&#039;t for you or is for a whole group) Make sure to be ok with yourself when purchasing a product and don&#039;t jump on products on a whim or without thought. Read - Research - Buy - Review.<br /><br />If most new buyers start giving helpful reviews and ideas to the cocaine community of SR than it helps not only the buyers but the system as a whole. The more information we can give the better it is at choosing a vendor or product.<br />Do not try to be someone you&#039;re not when giving an opinion of your product. It will come with time this typing thing. The more you participate the better it becomes and the more you take out of it at the end.<br /><br />As new buyers/reviewers please refrain from abusive or unverified claims that can actually put a negative impact and move us back instead of forward. If you have a problem or an issue please take the time to think of what it is exactly you want to say about the vendor or their gear. Please if you are going to mention or bring something up have proof or a general conscious of what is wrong, rather than blindly spewing hate and misinformation that leads nowhere and can actually make people less inclined to share their reviews or thoughts.<br /><br />The SR cocaine forum community is a great group of people from all walks of life who bring tons of experience and knowledge to the table, we do our best to help and steer in the right direction. I hope to see all of you&nbsp; cocaconnoisseurs in the main forums when you feel it is ready or you are able to. Don&#039;t be shy, it takes a bit of effort to achieve some recognition and we always welcome those who are wanting to contribute and make these forums into more than just a troll fest and vendor advertisement.<br /><br /><br />Also my talk show thread is a great place to regurgitate anything you have going on or anything you want to share or talk about. It&#039;s always a pleasure to have a new face there once in a while. We want to see the viewership on the talk show rise, so the more the merrier. Come one<br /><br />Come all.

				Thanks for this! I&#039;ve been following the SR cocaine review thread in the Rumor Mill for a little bit now. All great info. I&#039;ve learned quite a lot, but still feel like the biggest noob. I love any and all tips I can find.
