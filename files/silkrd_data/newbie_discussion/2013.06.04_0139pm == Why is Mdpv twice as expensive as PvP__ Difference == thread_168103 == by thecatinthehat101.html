				Hi all I was just wondering if someone could explain the difference in Mdpv vs. PvP?? I noticed that Mdpv is twice as expensive as PvP but I&#039;ve heard they are structurally similar is Mdpv worth the almost double the price?? What is the difference in effect in the user?? :D

				The only structural difference is MDPV&#039;s methylenedioxy group at the 3,4-position. I&#039;m not a chemist but I guess that would make it harder to synthesize, which could explain the higher price.<br />Or maybe the demand for MDPV is simply higher because its effects are more euphoric.<br />Another factor might be legality. MDPV is by far the better-known substance so I suppose that it&#039;s illegal in more countries than is a-PVP, which would be another explanation for the price difference.<br /><br />None of this was fact-checked ;)

				I guess it depends on the vendor.&nbsp; I see a-pvp for $16 and I see MDPV for $23.10 from two different vendors.&nbsp; Some vendors overcharge.

				Looked it up.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy.&nbsp; MDPV is schedule one and a-pvp isn&#039;t scheduled yet.&nbsp; Remember when mephedrone wasn&#039;t scheduled?&nbsp; It was cheap as piss.
