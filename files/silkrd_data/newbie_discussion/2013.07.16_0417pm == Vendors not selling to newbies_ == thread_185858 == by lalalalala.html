				Hello, <br /><br />Just tried to make my first order for some H from SupremeSmoke and he cancelled my order and didn&#039;t give a reason. Is it because i&#039;m so new? Does anyone know who else I can get something good from in the US?&nbsp; I was looking at trying Maestro and deluxedelivery, maybe...? Any suggestions?<br /><br /><br />Thanks! :)

				I would suggest running up your stats a bit with some lottery listings first. <br />I run the cheapest one on SR with only 2% commission. <br /><br />I also have some very cheap digital downloads.<br /><br />Here is the link to lottery: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b7da9f275c<br />And my store: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7e1ab9d128

				No problem, <br />You would be doing me a solid if you decide to buy a few tickets.<br /><br />Trying to get my lottery ranked now and it&#039;s hard to get first sales but don&#039;t worry I didn&#039;t save the $500 bond just to run with a few lottery cents<br />

				Please correct me if I am wrong. It seems weird because my bet is 0.50 and if I buy one ticket and my payout is multiplied by number of tickets you are just giving me 50 cents back? Minus the fees and your cut I am just giving you money in this scenario. The real life scenario I just did was bought 2 tickets at a total of $1.76 and lost. If I would have won my bet would have been for $1 and you would have multiplied by 2 and gave me $2? So in reality I would have won 0.24?<br /><br />&quot;Your bet is 50¢....3) Buy 1 - 3 tickets at a time. Payout is multiplied by your number of tickets.&quot;
