				And was wondering what the best deal on xanax bars? Anyone know the cheapest vendor for bars?<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t guess there&#039;s an option to filter the prices before searching?<br /><br />Thanks guys

				At the rate the price of the bitcoins are going up im inclined to sit on them for awhile.. But I guess id rather have drugs.<br /><br />I dont have any first hand experience ordering xanax, and frankly i&#039;m not sure if what he has listed is a &quot;bar&quot;, but the vendor &quot;QualityMeds&quot; seems to be top notch, and I should be recieving something from them shorlty, and for a fantastic price! :D<br /><br />Have a good one!

				Can you spare a buck fifty BTC? I&#039;m jonesing something terrible. Were this the streets of New York, you&#039;d see me on the corner, case open, playing my heart out on my sax, but alas, the internet is so much less personal. :-(

				I love how people are asking for &quot;donations&quot; and couldn&#039;t at least answer your question. I wouldn&#039;t trust any recommendations&nbsp; in the Newbie forum though. You can search for vendor reviews in the main forums, so at least you can verify everything.<br /><br />As far as cheapest xanax, if you are set on bars,&nbsp; it&#039;s going to be more expensive. Name brand prescriptions drugs go for a premium. Alprazolam powder is WAY cheaper. I don&#039;t really know anything about knockoff pills that are sold, but you can always check reviews.<br /><br />As far as ordering searches by price, you can&#039;t on SR. However, with a little command line skills in linux you can curl the results and use sed, awk, and sort to organize and sort them as you desire.<br /><br />Or you could throw your BTC away by sending them to 1MZGQoxjvD63ZNmCa6EPgs6CfZcPvYQsip<br /><br />My trash can runs linux.
