				I bought some LSD blotters from Lucydrop in late February. I tried them with a friend of mine. The blotters were like thin cardboard and were tasteless. We took a tab each and as we didn&#039;t feel anything after 1 hour, we took the second dose. The effects started to come up after 2-3 hours. There was a mild nausea, a lot of muscle aching in the back and neck, and an uncomfortable body load. We had some laughing burts. My friend was saying that he felt cold and both of us had occasional goosebumps. There was a mild pupil dilation. There were very slight OEVs (only if you tried hard!), but no vibrant colors. Rather, there was this feeling of anxiety and a bad feeling in my gut. I tried to close my eyes but the CEVs were so gloomy, dark, unpleasant, and void of any colors. By this time, both of us had come to believe that the tabs did not contain clean LSD (or no LSD at all). After 4-5 hours, despite of being completely sober, both of us were feeling really uncomfortable as there was this sensation of terrible anxiety and agitation that was getting worse and worse by the time. It came to the point that both of us had to take some Lorazepam to calm the terrible anxiety. My friend was complaining of a tremor in his hands. The anxiety got better after taking the Lorazepam tabs, however I could still feel the remaining unpleasant body load and the bad feeling in my gut for probably 18 hours after taking the tabs. I even wouldn&#039;t call it a trip!, it was one of the worst experiences we had ever had.<br />I strongly believe that the blotters didn&#039;t contain real LSD. I noticed some other costumer of LD had complained of a similar experience with Lucy&#039;s tabs on the forums.<br />Do you think it was weak LSD tainted with other drugs, or a completely different drug (RC)?<br />Given the tabs (card board like) were tasteless, what could be the content of the tabs?

				Typically RC laid tabs will have a unmistakeable metallic taste, that leaves you with a tingle/ burning sensation where the tab was held in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;Given that they where tasteless, and didnt seem to have some sort of coloring or shiny gloss to the back of the tabs, I wouldnt thiink they where anything but LSD..Thats not to say that it was terrible crystal that they where laid with. <br /><br />&nbsp;Ive never ordered from LD or the Real Lucy Drop..( im sure youve been following the LD/ RLD saga) but from what i understand, there was at some point clean potent LSD being sent out by them.

The description leads me to believe whoever synthed the crystal was not very knowledgeable, or just simply apathetic as to the quality of his chemical. With the massive amount of drama, confusion, and lack of reliability with either account involved in the LD/RLD feud, it would be unwise to purchase from either source until such a time that the issues are resolved, if at all. AlbertHoffman1943 seems to be a very promising vendor for the best Lucy available on the market...that good ol&#039; Humboldt GDF, White-on-White, no-taste fluff. I have not purchased from him, though I happen to have earned my Wings, which is why. I already have a line on Family Fluff of my own from (most likely) the same source in NorCal (if he is legit). His communications with me lead me to believe he is the real McCoy though, so I am pretty much at ease when referring his services.<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />Doctor

They DID have coloring and shiny gloss at the back of the tabs. Whatever it was, it was the shittiest product ever. I wish they were just blank tabs!

The lesson learned: buy a reagent kit and never trust the reviews!<br />But my question is, what chemical could it be? something tasteless with those characters that I mentioned above?<br />My presumption is that at least some of those people who where complaining of a &quot;weak batch&quot; had the same shit.<br />I think LD (or RLD) is full of shit. I agree with others that think it is highly probable that he was tony76, and he is continuing to sell under another name in SR.<br />Regardless, I&#039;m still curious to find out what that tasteless chemical could be?

				The probability of it being tony76 is there, I almost hope so...at east that way it is the same douchebag scamming people, and not a new one (or a group) moving in to the scene to bend us over and walk straight up our collective stratachocolatawallies! I am equally perplexed as to what the substance could be. I am at a loss as to any plausible answers. I hope you no longer have this occur.

				The colored gloss on the back ime always indicates some kind of nbome that has been complexed. If you didnt hold them in your mouth for at least 45 min before swallowing, that would not allow the nbomes to get into your blood stream, they are inactive when swallowed. This explains your terrible stomach pains and lack of a trip. sorry for this dude.

				LSD is supposed to be tasteless....if you taste any chemical/bitter taste SPIT IT OUT RIGHT AWAY! The old hippies used to say &quot;if its bitter, its a spitter&quot; tasting bitterness is the biggest sign that it is not LSD but it is a research chemical.

				I ordered some tabs from lucydrop 8. feb, and they were really weak. I tried 4 of them, but they barely made me trip at all. Though, I&#039;m pretty sure it was real LSD, as they felt exactly like the real deal, just very weak (maybe 10-20µg each). What kind of print were your tabs? Alpha centauri?<br /><br />I think it makes more sense that lucydrop sent out some really bad tabs that were fucked up before quitting, instead of having to get hold of a completely new chemical, and then send it out. I also guess that if it really was some cheap RC, then it would be stronger. <br /><br />I also have read that the NBOMe family rarely gives the negative effects you described. That combined with the bitter taste of NBOMe tabs make me pretty sure it&#039;s just really bad/weak LSD. Ofc I could be wrong...

				You&#039;ll never know because you didn&#039;t test it, simple as that. However, I&#039;ve had tasteless blotters that are DOC. I could faintly taste something but not the bitter taste people talk about. I know for a fact that it was DOC, unless the trusted vendor I got it from is giving me LSD instead (he&#039;s obviously not). Since you didn&#039;t trip hard it&#039;s possible they were low dosed, not sure if that has anything to do with less taste.
