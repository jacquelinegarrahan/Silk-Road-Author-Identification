				Okay so first off this is a guilty pleasure of mine we all have one or we wouldn&#039;t be on SR the only problem is I have work in less than four hours and there&#039;s no way I can sleep I have about $20 crack left I only use it once in a while and I didn&#039;t know I had work tomorrow until after I started doing it. I took 1mg of straight Alprazolam hoping that would help me sleep should I take more? If I shouldn&#039;t take more and there is no drug related remedy to this situation are their any ideas on what I should do and say next? As in make up and family excuse or go to the doctors and bring back a note so where I work doesn&#039;t fire me?

				a) just relax and let your body recharge. and if you&#039;re sluggish getting up for work, smoke the rest. but don&#039;t keep smoking right now.<br />b) doctor. &quot;my snot is yellowish green and my throat hurts&quot; or whatever you feel like saying. call out asap-2 hours before at least!!<br />c) how long has it been since you stopped smoking crack? if the alprazolam hasn&#039;t kicked in about 30 mins after taking it, take another one or benedryl or something that you know you&#039;ll hear your alarm clock go off still.<br />Also...can you not just go into work regardless of whether you&#039;ve slept or not? Like does smoking crack make you personally have a hangover the next day or what? You could always go into work and &quot;get sick&quot; and then go to the doctor where you describe stomach upsets and it could be just a &quot;24 hour bug&quot; lol<br />Good luck!

				I have found very strong hash to be invaluable in taking away that post-crack anxiety and stress- you also avoid that- &quot;have to have another hit&quot; feeling! Having said that, I realise that strong hash is not exactly what you want just before going into work lol.

				Sorry for the late reply I don&#039;t get on the forums much but I do buy a lot. I ended up taking more xanex in liquid forum. I pretty much just had to ride it out but that&#039;s life. ;)
