				Alright gang I am posting this in hopes of finding out what the fuck I put in body last night. I ordered a gram of MDMA domestic USA. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the deal. I have no concept of time what so ever so I will not be able to give those details. However this is what I do remember. <br /><br />Grinding up my gram into the finest powder I could get it into using my mortar-n-pestle. I cut out 200mg for each, myself and my buddy. We mixed it up good in a shot of gatorade and chased it down pretty good. Didn&#039;t taste to god awful. After about, I would guess maybe 15 - 20 minutes I started to feel nausea as did my buddy. I thought we should eat something, because we took it on an empty stomach. We tried eating and the food just pasted up in our mouth, really nasty. The next thing I knew I was zoooooooooooooooooooooooooming, my vision was blurry as shit, I could not see anything beyond a few inches in front of my face and my vision was focused down at my feet even though I was looking start ahead, very bizarre. I noticed my buddy laying on the sofa, eyes wide open and hardly responsive at all. Pupils were completely dilated, no color what so ever to be seen by my eyes anyways. I remember thinking I am about to hit to the floor myself and felt this feeling as if I was about to hit another reality separate from this one. I can&#039;t really explain it other than I remember seeing myself holding the sofa as I approached a dark tunnel with a light at the end. That seems like near death to me. It seemed like it only lasted a few moments at most but I can&#039;t tell you for sure. I remember getting myself outside and as soon as the air hit my face it was all over. Except for the visual affects which were still very blurry and darty. Almost like rapid eye movement but while I was awake, there should have been a bizzzzz sound that followed each focus attempt. I remember we started around 6pm and I finally remember the clock saying 8:15 when I was able to finally focus halfway decent. After that I do not recall the usual happy thoughts and feelings that I had experienced with Xtacy from my youth. I decided to smoke a nice bowl of Strawberry kush and that really put me a nice space, mind was finally numb and tingleys were coming on the limbs. Finally was able to sleep about midnight or so. <br /><br />So I have not taken X since the late 90&#039;s and back then I was taking way more than 200mg at a time and never recall anything like what I experienced last night. Can someone tell me is this normal for this dose? was it to high a dose? did I get something other than MDMA? Just trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				200 mg does seem like a lot to start with if you haven&#039;t done it since the 90&#039;s. You always want to start out low and dose yourself throughout the trip. It could&#039;ve also been bk mdma.

				A 200mg welcome back to MDMA is a pretty heroic dose. The stuff you&#039;ll get off the road is extremely pure ,depending on the vendor, so it could have just been the difference between 90&#039;s cut MDMA and SR 84% MDMA. This is all speculation though&nbsp; ;)

				I mean, it is a large dose but Ive dosed over 500mg for a kick and didnt get more than tracers. The visuals that you got is what is signaling to me that it wasnt mdma.

				Thanks for the info guys. I was wondering if it was just way better stuff than the I had back in the 90&#039;s. But like ytable says the visual stuff and the what seemed like out of body was not normal to me. Almost freaky to a degree if you are not expecting it.

				Sounds a bit like ketamine... if you were expecting ecstasy and actually dosed on ketamine you would have been in for a bit of a shock. <br /><br />Was it your first time? How experienced with mdma were you?

				I&#039;ve had a similar experience when I dose 200mg of mdma and 2 hours later redosed another 350mg. I had literally no balance, thought I was playing world of warcraft when I was in bed with my girl. Couldn&#039;t walk at all and had really weird visuals. <br /><br />What you had may have been really good MDMA, could have been a piperazine or it could be a combination of both, in my experience and opinion.

				phalNOP, I am not sure what substances you were sold to as MDMA but MDMA shouldnt give you intense visuals so that you think you are in an alternate reality. His report in no way sounds like MDMA.

				I&#039;m wondering if &quot;blurry and darty&quot; can be attributed to the eye wiggles.<br /><br />It is possible that your MDMA has MDA in it.&nbsp; MDA is stronger, more visual (psychedelic), more stimulating.&nbsp; The synthesis is the same as MDMA except for the last step I believe.&nbsp; If it is a mix of MDMA and MDA then a test kit if going to show positive for MDMA.<br /><br />If you weigh out the MDMA you have left is it 600mg?<br /><br />I&#039;ve often found the the come-up on MDMA is hard but once it passes I&#039;m in bliss.

				ive over done it a couple of times... had large orders come in and got wayyyy too carried away... in my experiences but ive only had the visuals and the sickening feeling once along with not knowing reality as well as talking absolute total shit thinking i was somewhere where i wasnt for eg sitting in a room at a mates house and semi conscious asking if anyone had spoken to the girl at reception.... that once off the mdma i had bought was brown and bad smelling aniseed <br />since then ive only ordered white non smelling mdma and when i have over done it on the white stuff i seem to just sweat a lot and chew my face off with intense body rushes...<br />from what i can figure out through research and other people is the brown stuff isnt pure or washed properly and still has a lot of the reactants left in it causing the sickening feeling and visuals, where the white mdma is more close to pure with little reactants left in it, 100% pure is actually meant to be crystal clear which i&#039;d do anything to get my hands on ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;ve actually had a similar experience on a very large dose of MDMA before. I&#039;ve even rolled so hard I&#039;ve blacked out for 30 to 45 minutes. You just had a lot of serotonin built up with fresh receptors and rolled your nuts off. Lucky you.&nbsp;

				snip<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Visual effects:<br />The visuals experienced with MDMA are just as powerful as any classic psychedelic when they hit you. They can be described as similar to LSD in terms of their fast kaleidoscopic movement. While still playing much more of an emphasis on imagery and structures within the closed eye visuals than anything found within a typical LSD trip. Making them surprisingly closer in terms of appearance to mushrooms and Ayahuasca but with a synthetic and somehow almost menacing feeling. Following a sinister and ominous style with a colour scheme to them that generally consists of greys and blues. Although I would definitely describe these visuals as consistently sinister and ominous I am not speaking of them in a negative way. This just seems to be the style of these visuals when compared to traditional psychedelics and has never bothered me or any of my friends.<br />At extremely high doses of MDMA level 6 psychedelic visuals and the sensation of experiencing the entire universe at once eventually become present. This is not something I have experienced personally but has been reported by a friend who ended up taking a very large dosage, causing him to vomit and momentarily collapse on the floor.<br />The distortions experienced with MDMA are felt at low to moderate doses and fairly common, usually described as a general enhancement of visual acuity, accompanied by extremely minor distortions such as tracers. Many people also report that objects within the visual field become somehow fluffier or smoother around the edges. <br />The hallucinations and imagery experienced with MDMA induce extremely vivid and realistic hallucinatory states. Capable of producing open eye hallucinations that happen at proportionally low levels of intoxication when compared to traditional psychedelics. What I mean by this is that while the classical psychedelics only produce vivid 3D hallucinations at the highest levels of breakthrough psychedelic experience, MDMA on the other hand can spontaneously produce them on rare occasions when a person is feeling close to sober. Or when they have fully come down off of the drug. These are usually completely solid and not made out of condensed visuals as with DMT or Mushrooms, usually laid out over your external environment in a fashion that shares characteristics with deliriants. <br />MDMA hallucinations usually seem to be completely random in nature, devoid of the spiritual and religious undertones that are near universal with classical psychedelics. Often following plots of events that you would expect to happen in real life and seamlessly blending in with the external environment. For example people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which you would expect them to in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses when they are not and mistaking objects in the peripheral vision as human beings. Occasionally these can become spontaneous hallucinatory scenarios, briefly detaching you from the external world before placing you back into it moments later. Generally consisting of random objects, people, places and nonsensical plots.<br /><br />Auditory effects:<br />The experience of audio hallucinations on MDMA is extremely common, usually occurring at the end of the night and almost always consisting of memory replays from the previous several hours. Commonly manifesting themselves as spontaneous clips of the music that was played and garbled voices of the people that were spoken too. These can become as loud in volume as the level of noise heard at any rave or house party and can occasionally become complex enough to manifest themselves as intricate, previously unheard and completely coherent songs or symphonies of any style.<br /><br />Hypnagogic Scenarios:<br />One of MDMA’s unique psychedelic effects are something that only presents itself once a person has comedown and decided to go to sleep. It’s at this point where the brain natural hypnagogia (the state between waking and sleep) seems to become vastly potentiated. This places you in extremely vivid scenarios that play out somewhat like a film. These can be hallucinations of anything and are often nonsensical but are usually memory replays associated with the people, places and events of the past several hours. In terms of the general plot and how they look, these scenarios are easy to recall immediately after wards, but what was said by the people in them is always impossible.<br />Although these scenarios become increasingly elaborate as you get closer to falling asleep, once it finally happens, dreams do not seem to be potentiated in any noticeable way.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />snap

				I think all those extremely positive ratings have something to do with the blacklist that buyers risk to end up on if they give negative feedbacks. Ive seen vendors that threaten people to put them on the blacklist if they dont give them a 5/5 rating. Im not against the blacklist because there are definitely scammers amongst the buyers as well, but I cant believe that one vendor alone can put a buyer on the blacklist, it would make more sense if there would be at least three vendors needed to blacklist a buyer.... Maybe this is the case and im just stupid... and sorry for the offtopic post, I cant post in the right thread because i haven&#039;t got my 50 newbie posts yet.

				damn!! thats crazy. I took quiet a bit(amount of trips) of mdma but never such dosage. usually .1 is enough to get me feeling like a party rocket, and the effects were always reallly nice nothing like your roll. only once I took what i thought was maybe .17/.2 I was sweating and terrorized my buddys toilet. you should investigate the vendors product see how other reviews are.

				Hey gang. Thank you for all the feedback. I fell asleep last night while browsing the forums. I am waiting on a test kit to see what is going on for sure. <br /><br />If it was made with ketamine wouldn&#039;t that have made us really sleepy? &quot;K&quot; being a sedative an all? or that a part of the speed ball affect? The X we did in the 90&#039;s was just straight tablets about the size of mini skittles, little blues with a a trojan horse on them if I remember correctly. We would eat 2 and snort 2 and be off and running really nice. They tested good and weighed out at about 100mg each, so 400mg never never gave me anything close to this experience. I am not ruling out the difference in purities but the visuals were defly scary since I wasn&#039;t expecting them. My buddy was literally laid out on the sofa for a while. I&#039;m not sure of the timing but I was outside for seemed like a bit before I saw him coming out the door. I did have the tongue sucking and want to talk a lot but way after the initial freak out episode. <br /><br />I did speak with the vendor before ordering the product to see what was used to make it. His response was pure MDMA and no cut. I was wrong in just assuming that meant he used baby powder or baking powder or any powder that wasn&#039;t of the RC variety. <br /><br />I will wait for the test kit before trying anymore for sure, but I almost want to go again now that I know what is to be expected. <br /><br />Thanks again

I did have the tongue sucking and want to talk a lot but way after the initial freak out episode. <br /><br />I did speak with the vendor before ordering the product to see what was used to make it. His response was pure MDMA and no cut. I was wrong in just assuming that meant he used baby powder or baking powder or any powder that wasn&#039;t of the RC variety. <br /><br />I will wait for the test kit before trying anymore for sure, but I almost want to go again now that I know what is to be expected. <br /><br />Thanks again<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No. Ketamine doesn&#039;t necessarily make you sleepy. <br /><br />In fact it was developed as an awake-anesthetic but ditched due to patients reporting visual hallucinations and dis-associative affects - and also used as a daterape drug because it makes people pliable, easy to control but largely unresponsive whilst being entirely conscious.

Great high, but i&#039;m moving into day 3 of withdrawals from benzo&#039;s. Not a cool combo!
