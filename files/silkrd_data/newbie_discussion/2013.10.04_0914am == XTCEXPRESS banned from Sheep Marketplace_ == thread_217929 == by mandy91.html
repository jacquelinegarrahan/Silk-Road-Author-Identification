				Dear Silkroad community members,<br /><br />Going to keep it short and sweet. After registering on sheep marketplace and going through the category of ecstasy I&#039;ve noticed XTC EXPRESS has been banned already. If you ask me I say something strange is occurring over there so be wary. <br /><br />Let me know what all your thoughts are on this.<br /><br />

				That account was suspected to be not the real XTCEXPRESS. The SuperTrips account is also under suspicion, and has 1 shady listing up offering a &quot;sale&quot; which you have to FE for. Looks like it&#039;s getting a lot of attention too. People may in fact be that idiotic.

				There are a couple of sellers that doen&#039;t seem legit to me, alarm bells ring when i look at sellers that never used to sell to oz and nz but now do, there&#039;s one in particular that is using the name of a well known SR seller offering 75% refund.<br /><br />as for sheep I trust the site it has been around for a while.

				The forum is also being split between the two new sites so makes sure sellers are the same from SR.
