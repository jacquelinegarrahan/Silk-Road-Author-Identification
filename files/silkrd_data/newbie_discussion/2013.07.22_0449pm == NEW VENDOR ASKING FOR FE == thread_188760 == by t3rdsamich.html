				Hey everyone there is a new vendor asking people to FE already, hes only been around a couple of weeks and has started already. His name is Unlimitedlife. Now I cant&nbsp; say hes scamming and he very well could be an honest vendor but cmon, asking someone to FE when you have absolutely no stats to back it up? You would think by now that people would know better but I looked on his vendor page and there are people doing it. I recently fell victim to a vendor who asked me to FE. He had a perfect record for over 300 transactions and had been around for several months. He even made it seem like he was helping me out cuz im disabled by covering the shipping. Please dont fall for this shit. SR will help you in absolutely no way at all if you go outside the escrow system no matter how desperate, genuine and sad your story is. Trust me on this... Please stop the FE madness. If everyone would just stop doing it, the vendors would stop asking.<br /><br /><br />All the best everyone. Be safe.

				Thanks Im just trying to save everyone the same grief that I went through.... bitcoins are expensive and in some countries hard to come by. Who can afford to take the chance of finalizing early when its clearly against the rules to begin with. Even long time vendors can just take your money and run. Once you hit that finalize button your order completely disappears from your screen and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Some vendors are building up a bit of a reputation and then asking people to FE in a blowout sale or something like that... then they take your money, start a new vendor account and nobody has any clue that its them.... Be safe people... keep your hard earned money.<br /><br />Stay in escrow and at least you can ask SR for help.

				I don&#039;t understand why people feel the need to FE. I never did it and never will. There are far too many vendors who will give even newbies a chance to prove themselves trust worthy. You just have to start off small and be patient. BTC are very expensive these days and I can&#039;t afford to lose one red coin!

				Ha see I knew it... its probably the same vendor that scammed me the one time that I FE&#039;d which was just a couple weeks ago with a new account. He got the greed bug going on so he started all over with a new account and didnt even wait to build a rep before asking to FE lol. <br /><br /><br />I can understand why people feel the urge to FE. Sometimes the other vendors wont get back to you and you need to order right away or your jonesin and just want the order in the mail or the prices are lower for a certain vendor but they want you to FE or for me it was suboxone/ subutex and there arent a ton of vendors selling it let alone ship to my country and I think there are only 2 that actually ship from my country. So far my SR experience has been that its best and fastest to by from local vendors. I have made 3 purchases from out of country and they have either take almost the full 17 days to arrive or havent arrived at all. Im still waiting on the 3rd one. <br /><br />When I ordered local it was literally here the next day. Come on Canada wheres all the drug dealers at? lol.

				I&#039;ve done it a few of times for trusted vendors if they needed some funds immediately or thought my country had too tight customs that they would risk it, unless FE. It has mostly gone well. I was burned only once on SR by goddamn Larghetto, but that was mostly just me being a noob who needed to learn a lesson the hard way.
