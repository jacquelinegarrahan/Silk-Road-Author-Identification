				Hello there,<br /><br />I am a complete newb and I must apologize up front if I appear retarded. I am still learning and trawling the forums and I have a long way to go. <br /><br />I was considering wholesaling Shrooms (I enjoy growing), but am not sure about how to find out if there is a demand for such things. Particularly in Australia. Seems to me that there is not a lot of vendors selling them, but not a great demand either (just looking at the feedback count on their listings). It seems to me like the most popular guy is selling maybe 20 parcels or so a month...<br /><br />Any thoughts would be very appreciated.<br />Thank you kindly for reading my message. I hope you are all having a great day.<br />Munchy

				Personally I think so yes, if you can offer competitive prices.(preferably lower then the current, which is too high imo)<br />I&#039;ll be your first customer :D

				Thank you kindly for your thoughts Issb. Very much appreciate your time.<br /><br />I am still learning the ropes, so I would imagine it&#039;s a while off until I&#039;m set up. I am sure I can be competitive on pricing although it&#039;s never too wise to engage in price wars, especially somewhere that I am new to. Don&#039;t want to upset the apple cart :)<br /><br />I would however tend to agree the price seems a bit high considering the alternative highs available. <br /><br />The other route I can go is green plant growing, but while that is also an enjoyable past time, it is more difficult to stealth.&nbsp; It is possibly more profitable tho....at least higher volume...for a professional...<br /><br />Thank you once again, I feel better sinking hours into research now :) Any other feedback is also much appreciated!<br /><br />

				Assuming green plant growing means weed, then that&#039;s also a great idea. There are never enough domestic vendors for weed, it&#039;s better now but a few weeks ago the weed listings for domestic were super dry. If possible I&#039;d say do both, either on its own is fine too though. If/when you do start up a vendor account it never hurts to make an offer in the product listings forum, they don&#039;t have to be free either just discounted is good. Just make sure if you do them to give them to people who can show you their previous reviews so you won&#039;t be sending out product and getting nothing back for it. It shows good will and an intent to be a reliable/long standing vendor when doing offers imo. As for vendor stuff I think just learning PGP is a must, many buyers won&#039;t touch vendors who don&#039;t use PGP because it shows a lack of understanding/care sort of. Also be completely honest about your product quality and try your hardest to get actual pictures of the product you will be selling.(A lot of vendors just rip pictures of google images etc and that can raise some red flags sometimes)<br />That&#039;s all I can think of at the moment, if you have any questions or whatever I&#039;ll try to help out.

				Thank you once again Issb!<br /><br />Well I&#039;m pretty paranoid about things, but for me it is safer to specialise in one thing due to space constraints. With the economics of it, setup costs are not particularly cheap when things are to be done well, and if you do more of the same there is greater return on investment. Plus I&#039;m anal about making really good stuff and that takes specialisation :)<br /><br />I dig on the PGP front, I&#039;m researching it (it&#039;s on the list) :)<br /><br />My biggest concern that I haven&#039;t quiet figured out is getting paid in cash, in a clean untraceable manner that isn&#039;t mega time consuming. My best plan at the moment is PO box under someone else&#039;s name and using localbitcoin or something with cash in the mail. I&#039;m not so sure I like that tho...Clearly the pro&#039;s here can pull it off somehow tho....but for me, that is the hardest part of my research endeavors at this time.<br /><br />Cannot thank you enough for your thoughts!<br />

				Few points.<br /><br />1. Any weed dealer who can sell under street rate for an oz will kill here!<br /><br />2. Same deal with shrooms, good price, decent stuff will move well, as will any drug - Australia is a $7bn a year drug economy with a tiny tiny tiny portion of that on the road, it is time for us to grow this up!<br /><br />3. if you can afford to live without the profits immediately, you can re-invest to your supply with bitcoin and send profits off shore after mixing the coins and cashing out, even in your name, any decent law office will help you set up &quot;wealth management&quot; and savings accounts in tax havens with privacy. AFP really don&#039;t do much in terms of getting into overseas accounts and need to prove the money is from fraud is directly from a crime which is very hard, especially if you say enjoy a gamble :)<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />B
