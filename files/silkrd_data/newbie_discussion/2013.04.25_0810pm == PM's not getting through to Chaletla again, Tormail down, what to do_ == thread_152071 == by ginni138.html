				If the information is not sensitive in nature there is always Privnote as an emergency, that is always up, but only if it isn&#039;t.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				How would I be able to use privnote to get a message to him? I can log into SR &amp; I have dropped him a PM, but he hasn&#039;t logged on for 6 days according to his profile which is a bit out of character for him.. I just really need some info on an order I placed &amp; FE with him before all these issues with the site being down started... Any ideas?

				He last logged into the forum on the 30th but with silkroad going up and down I&#039;m sure he will be back when he can log in .. I hope so I placed an order that is still processing and I&#039;m debating to cancel or not I really want to get what I ordered from him but desperate times call for other solutions.
