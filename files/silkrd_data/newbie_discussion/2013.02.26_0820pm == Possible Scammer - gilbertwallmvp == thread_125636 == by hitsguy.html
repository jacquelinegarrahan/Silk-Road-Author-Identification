				I&#039;ve made the possible mistake of finalizing early, before reading that you should never finalize early ever after finding this forum (after i purchased.)<br /><br />Vendor&#039;s name is gilbertwallmvp<br /><br />I ordered some adderall from the guy. He reads my messages nearly immediately yet takes a few days to respond.. with very short and obscure messages.<br /><br />Be warned, I may have lost 4.46 bitcoins. I will update if that turns out not to be the case.

				Well that would suck. <br /><br />Honestly I doubt it, sometimes do just take long and since your waiting for DRUGS to come to YOU, it makes the wait even harder :P

				That vendor is currently in the process of trying to cash out a lot of their BTCs with me [which is just a normal thing for vendors to do, btw, nothing &quot;suspicious&quot;] &amp; I&#039;ve noticed their seller rating has dropped almost 10 percentage points (from 100% to 92%, &amp; I think now it&#039;s at 93%) within the span of only a couple of days. That&#039;s NOT in &amp; of itself an ample reason to assume that anyone&#039;s a scammer, of course, but it&#039;s a very good reason to be hesitant about ordering from them.<br />I know that this vendor is online very frequently, constantly reading their messages, &amp; constantly sending me messages at least -- I can&#039;t keep up with them. So there&#039;s no reason they shouldn&#039;t suddenly be responding to buyers.<br />If you finalized early, then you actively played a part in allowing the vendor to scam you - if that&#039;s what happens, of course, &amp; regardless of the fact that I&#039;m sure you did it unknowingly - so you can&#039;t get anything reimbersed.<br />Have you told them in any of your messages to them that you were already posting on the forums about the possibility of them having scammed you? If not, do so, &amp; tell them that you&#039;ll continue to do so unless you either receive your order from them &amp;/or receive a reply, whichever happens first. If they don&#039;t respond to a PM like that, you&#039;re probably not going to get anything - including your purchase - from them.

				Turns out the son of a fucking bitch was a scammer and got away with god knows how many bitcoins based on how he FEd. He&#039;s been shut down from Silk Road, i got burned for 4.5 bitcoins (which is a shitload of money today) and that&#039;s that.&nbsp; :o
