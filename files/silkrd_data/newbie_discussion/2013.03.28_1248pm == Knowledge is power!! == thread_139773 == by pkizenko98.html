				I like where your head is at, this isnt just about access to something that is hard to get, its not just about substances that can expand your counsciousness.&nbsp; This is about individual freedom first and foremost, the ability to decide for yourself what is right for you or what is wrong for you.&nbsp; By being personaly responsible for yourself you decide your fate, and that is in my opinion freedom.&nbsp; I felt very disillusioned about so many things I saw around me, the prevaling attitudes and lack of respect amongst people who have been codled and dumbed down by governments and laws and opinions.&nbsp; BUT SR has given me hope that first there are othres out there and they are willing to not sit back and be told what to do, a spark of truth and justice in a world of lies and wrongdoings.&nbsp; Just look how when left to our own devices a community springs up that look out for one another( ie. avengers threads that seek to protect and seek truth), and second that left to police themselves people look out for each other, that through the ugliness beauty and real genuine knowledge will shine.&nbsp;
