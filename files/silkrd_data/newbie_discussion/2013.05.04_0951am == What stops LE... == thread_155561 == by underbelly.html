				Hi all,<br /><br />What really concerns me is whats stopping LE from becoming a SR vendor, raking up great feedback and in the process, building a database of all the buyers then trying to bust them for importing/buying drugs online?<br /><br />Sure many SR buyers will deny the package is even theirs using the standard guidelines, keeping their mouth shut and speed dialing their lawyer, but for a small number, some SR users will shit their pants and spill the beans.<br /><br />Is this just another &quot;deal with it&quot; or what?

				That kind of feels like a form of entrapment.<br />Also, turn around and put a citizens arrest on them for selling drugs to people. Not like they don&#039;t mass distribute the shit anyways to countries to create problems for them to then fix.<br /><br />This is a pretty legitimate question though....

This is why internet and PC security is so important as to not leave any trace for LE to follow if a raid occurs. And also keeping your house/apartment drug free in the first place, which is hard for addicts or sloppy people. <br /><br />Right now I probably have like 10 items for which I can get done badly, probably not worth jail time in Australia but a hefty fine/community service etc. I will definitely get rid of them or mask them before doing any SR activity.
