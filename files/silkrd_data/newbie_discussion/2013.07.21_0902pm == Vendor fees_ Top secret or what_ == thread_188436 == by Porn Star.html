				So there are practically no results on the forum about vendor fees. I assume they get deleted. I can&#039;t imagine why it would be such a big secret. <br />If you don&#039;t want to post a response for whatever reason, I&#039;d be grateful if a vendor could pm me a breakdown of the listing fees if any and the percentage SR takes off of sales of various sizes. I understand that it fluctuates, but any information would be great.<br /><br />Thanks a lot!

				The percent commission charged at this point can be found with the following formula:<br /><br />6.7 x e^(-p/6) + 4<br /><br />where p is the price of the listing in Bitcoins.&nbsp; So, for example, a 10 btc listing has a total commission of 5.27%, or 0.5265 btc.

				i sometimes lose over 20% in fees (including hedging) on my lowest priced listings. the fees are not set in stone unfortunately so you never know how much you&#039;re going to get

				Thanks BTC King. SR is pretty badass and all, but a little more transparency would be nice for people considering becoming vendors. The hedging thing seems a bit confusing. I thought that it locked in the price for vendors and put the currency risk on buyers. I don&#039;t think I fully understand it yet. It&#039;s probably easy to understand once your account is upgraded to vendor status.<br /><br />Ah well. I&#039;ll be able to handle the fees and still be profitable, so vendor account, here I come!

				Thanks again BTC King. I had read about the hedging and thought that DPR/SR were taking the exchange rate risk. What you&#039;ve explained makes more sense.<br />Do you mind sharing roughly what price range one might expect 20% total fees on? I&#039;ll probably start with weed listings priced from $10 to $150 until I&#039;ve built a rep people will trust with more weight.
