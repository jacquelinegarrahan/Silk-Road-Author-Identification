				I never seen 1 dog at my facility or heard of a dog there. Only time LE were there was to lock up handlers/loaders/drivers that stole. Most investigation was done inhouse by loss/prevention management. Packages come in by 18 wheelers and leave by either 18 wheelers or route trucks.

				I can&#039;t speak for express, i worked ground. Around the holiday season a ton of temp workers are hired, I know of loaders who would shake packages for pills open them and re-tape them shut. Alot of ipod/iphone theft, sneakers etc. Most loaders knew what packages to look for from certain companies. As far as residential to residental no-one really fucked with them.

				The only time packages were pulled off the line if they were ripped up, or the label was non-legible, bad address. Packages would be opened to look for packing slips, phone numbers. Our first priority was to get the package delivered by any means necessary. Last resort is to return to sender.<br /><br />99.9% of workers just want to get in and get the packages loaded/delivered and get the fuck home.

C) Flag down ground driver give him package. (Ground drivers are independent contractors and get paid per package delivered/picked up.)&nbsp; They will be happy to take your packages without having to go out of his/her way.&nbsp; Ground and Express are two separate entities, and use different packaging labels. You cant give a ground driver an express package and vice-versa. As long as your package doesn&#039;t have an obvious strong smell of marijuana I don&#039;t see how it could be intercepted. <br /><br />If I were a buyer using ground:&nbsp; All ground packages require a signature. If your worried about signing for a package leave a generic note. eg. (Leave all mail and packages at door. Thanks) Drivers may leave packages at there discretion. If it is a low crime area and theres a safe spot to leave the package, a driver release may be performed.&nbsp; Drivers can also leave packages with neighbors.&nbsp; They are encouraged to do anything reasonable to get the package off the truck. Managements biggest gripes are safety and delivery %. <br /><br /><br />I have never seen drugs in packages, but then again I only had to open a few packages due to bad/missing labels to look for packing slips.

				Have you ever stolen a package that you knew was drugs/expensive?<br /><br />I knew of&nbsp; loaders who stole pills, but they were from pharmacies/drug companies. They eventually knew what kind of boxes and return labels various rx companies used. They would pull them of the line into the trucks, open them determine what was in them,&nbsp; then tape them back up.<br /><br />A driver was stealing laptops but got caught after his 5/6th time doing it.<br /><br />I never stole anything, but big bulk boxes would fall apart often, you might find contents that slide under shelves after the delivery was made or towards the end of the day. DVDs, Blu Rays, Games action figures.
