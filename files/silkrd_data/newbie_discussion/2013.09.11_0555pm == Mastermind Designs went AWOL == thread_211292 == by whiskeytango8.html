				I ordered from Mastermind designs, but never got the coins. Today, his vendor pages and product pages disappeared, but it looks like he&#039;s still a member (clicking on his name lets you message him). What could have happened? How do I get my money back?

				sounds to me like his account got suspended. Did you FE? if so say goodbye to your money its long gone. If you didnt and your money is in escrow it should be refunded to you by the good old Sr staff.

I haven&#039;t released escrow so I am quite confident I will at least get my money back, but my question is more about what happened to his account and whether or not he has any chance to be back in business soon. The consensus seems to be that he is more a horrible seller with poor communication than a plain scammer ; even those who praise his work say his orders take forever to arrive. So I am willing to extend the due date and wait a bit more, but only if it is useful: if MD has been permanently banned or something like that I will just ask for a refund and get my money back now. Could some admin make a statement ?

				MM did not go AWOL. MM is scamming people. How do I know? I am one of his victims... DO NOT PURCHASE<br /><br />MM responded yesterday to an order than went to the Resolution Center 7 days ago. The dispute was &quot;Under Review&quot; without any communication from MM prior to yesterday. His response was that &quot;as promised it will arrive by Thursday. no worries&quot; It certainly is not this Thursday as it is now Thursday and I do not have the coin I ordered.<br /><br />The dispute is still open in the resolution center, sadly from all the other comments on this forum it does not look good for me or anyone else.

				He probably lost his vending privileges for breaking the rules by selling counterfeit currency and bullion.

				his product pages will disappear and then reappear. it is just him taking down the listing, modifying it then a few weeks later putting it back up again. he is very much active still on SR - this is a part of his scam. MM is a true scammer, he has fine tuned his scamming skills over many months - if not years.<br /><br />MM SR rule violations<br />1) marking a packing in transit before it is in transit (MM marked my package in transit on Sunday Aug 25th)<br />2) the description of his product is also not accurate - he states he only sells 3 of the morgan 1893 s coins a month when the feedback clearly shows differently<br /><br />its getting late, what else can you guys think of to add to the list?<br /><br />there is another thread on this forum that the person getting scammed goes into a little more detail about how MM scammed him. My story is turning out exactly the same except I have not finalized the transaction or accepted the resolution he offers of extending the time. (as if 3 weeks is not enough time to ship a domestic package).<br /><br />at this point all i have is the SR resolution center to assist to resolve this.

				I can confirm that I received an order from him less than a week ago. Everything was perfect and even included an extra sample. I talked to him yesterday and he said he was going on vacation. Of course we cannot confirm this either way.<br /><br />I think it may be possible that he was banned for selling counterfeit currency. As mentioned above, this is a violation of SR policy. Only time will tell what really happened...

				hey everybody&nbsp; &nbsp;i just wanted to say a couple things about my experience with MD and hopefully give the honest users of SR some reassurance ..courtesy of an honest vendor (myself) <br /><br />after my order was marked in transit i had many suspicions...and rightfully so when a vendor tells me on multiple different occasions that an order has shipped and i hadn&#039;t received anything ....this guys patterns are hard to read... i was skeptical about his services, because like others have noticed.....there are many listings for his products, but as far as Morgan coins he states he&#039;ll only sell 3 a month... A promise that im not sure on whether he broke... i say that because today i received my order!!!!&nbsp; ....only after being in resolution i might add....&nbsp; MD is dead wrong for the way he handles his communication and order processing.....but i released funds to him today....coin looks gorgeous&nbsp; &nbsp;and i took a video opening the packaging because i was unsure if it would just be a blank letter....instead a w<br />idk what to say....as far as i know anyone who went into resolution got their money back...as they rightfully should have... hopefully you didnt finalize <br /><br />**erase the hate and stay true**

				It is my understanding that he was closed down by sr for selling counterfeit silver.

				SR support said the sale of counterfeit bullion is permitted as long as it is not accepted as currency. In addition, it must be advertised as fake.<br /><br />Its hard to say if he was banned or not. I guess we&#039;ll see if he returns from &quot;vacation&quot;...<br />

				Whether he is allowed to sell fake silver bullion is beside the point. The point of this thread is that he is scamming people. I have had my order in resolution center for more than 2 weeks and no coin and no refund.<br /><br /><br />SCAMMER SELLER!!! STAY AWAY FROM MASTERMIND DESIGNS SCAMMER SELLER!!!

				thats great you got yours. hopefully it took less than 6 months to get to you. it seems as though MM has been in the Resolution Center many times before and knows exactly what to say and do. I did not extend the time either, the Resolution Center &quot;automatically&quot; did. seems like a much larger scam to me. 3 weeks and no item and no refund wtf??? sellers wonderful 14 day money back guarantee should still be good LMAO
