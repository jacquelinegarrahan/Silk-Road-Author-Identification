				If you take the right precautions and do the rights procedures, no.<br />If you manage to have absolutely no proof it was you whom ordered it they will have no case on you.<br /><br />Do not sign for a package, ever.<br />Read up on forums for tips and tricks.

				^Exactly, i cant count how many times ive seen people sign for roommates packages or ive signed for my grandmas/dads/moms/friends package, or ive woke up tired and just signed for a package cause the mailman said it was for me and my signature was needed, maybe someone sent me a birthday present, ya know, why the fuck wouldnt a normal person not ordering drugs not sign for it?? I sign for every package of research chems i get in the mail and honestly wouldnt be that scared to sign for anything harder. If your package was discovered, customs throws it, way too much wasted time trying to prove unproveable stuff for the reasons i stated. Not signing for a package you expected not to have to sign for is way suspicious, if i was the mailman id be like why is this dude so crazy about signing for a package, definitely something suspicious about this guy, if a dealer forgets to waive the signature on an express, or the usps person at the counter doesnt notice the check mark on the waive signature, it could happen easily, and at least in my case i would never freak out and refuse to sign, thats asking for trouble~

				Thanks for all the replies :). I know that you will not get in trouble in the USA, but Denmark is not as free as America. Here the police can search your house with out a warrent, and throw you in jail without a trial. I just hope the same amount of evidence is needed in Denmark as in America, when it comes to drugs in the mail.

				Remember the recent case of the UK guy caught importing pills... they raided his home and found more pills and powders there.<br /><br />CLEAN YOUR HOUSE. No drugs, none. No torrents or pirated films. No nothing. You don&#039;t want them raiding you over hash and then busting you because you had some coke sitting around.<br /><br />Roughly 99% of the time you will be fine, the other 1% of the time &quot;this is the first I&#039;ve heard of it, officer, perhaps some Muslims are trying to get Norwegians into trouble?

Then they can but NORMALLY it requires a warrant. The only thing u got right is that the evidence is not nulled and can be used, but that is because their suspension was true? Common sense. I don&#039;t think you can mention many cases if any where the police raids a house searching for drugs but instead ends up with guns. Often they get both, but they ALWAYS find what they came for. Rest is just a + for them! <br /><br />rofl kid, the &quot;anti terror pakke&quot; can only be used if you&#039;re a threat to society/state.&nbsp; So get your facts right! YOU CAN NEVER GO TO JAIL WITHOUT A TRIAL UNLESS IT&#039;S TERORRISM YOU&#039;RE CHARGED FOR!!! and i can&#039;t see what the fuck terroism has to do with drug charges? You&#039;re the type of guy who sits reading on the internet all day long without ever knowing how it goes on in the real life . I can even hear u&#039;ve never been to jail so stop making false statements about the danish justice system. Dude i&#039;ve experienced a lot and been in &amp; out system many times ;) <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry the police wont put u in jail without a trial because u bought some drugs over the internet :D ^^ I promise u that

				There was a similar sort of thread recently - a girl (somewhere in western europe I think) had a package seized by customs and they&#039;d sent a letter to her house telling her she must go an interview about the drugs they&#039;d found. She was freaking out and not sure what to do. I think she went for the interview and invited people to pm her for the outcome. But I think it turned out okay - deny deny deny. <br /><br />sorry but I&#039;ve taken too many drugs to remember where that thread was. think it might even have been this section? <br /><br />Seems to depend where you are. Over the years I&#039;ve had packages with benzos or little baggies of (pharma) pills opened up by customs and they&#039;ve just resealed it and sent it on to me. Never understood that. I think I had one seized - they just stuck a letter in the package, resealed it and sent it to me. <br /><br />What I&#039;d like to know is whether they flag your address thereafter?

But as they are a lower schedule, I think, that may be the reason that you still got your pills, i used to have friends that ordered alot of benzos/tylenol3s, and if I remember right that was the scoop on how it worked, sometimes larger amounts would get seized with a love letter sent, but usually theyd arrive in the bottles directly from a pharm company, they were brown bottles directly from company, not a filled script from a pharmacy, like when you order trammies, those anyone can get overnighted anytime they want, I learned that tramadol can cause withdrawals/seretonin syndrom the hard way because of that~
