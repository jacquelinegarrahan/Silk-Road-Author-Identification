				I can offer competitive prices for green and have quality strains available. I just want to get an idea on at what price point people would start jumping on the deal. This will give me a better idea on what to offer when I first set up my vendor account.<br /><br /><br />So...what would be really good pricing for the following:<br /><br />- quarter of hydro<br />- half oz of hydro<br />- oz of hydro<br />- qp of hydro<br />- hp of hydro<br />- p of hydro<br /><br />Also, what do people pay for indoor organic and outdoor (BC kush) on here?

				<br />- quarter of hydro - £50&nbsp; &nbsp; $71-76<br />- half oz of hydro - £85-90&nbsp; &nbsp;$142-150<br />- oz of hydro -&nbsp; £185-190&nbsp; &nbsp; $290&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prices are different in different countries so if you want the best customer base, choose the cheapest place and convert the prices accordingly. id say if you had real quality, and you sold everything at Good US prices, You would rapidly take over the UK market as they require someone cheap and regular that has high quality.<br />Id maybe recommend giving away a few free samples, But only to people who are genuinely helpful and people who maybe have a good reputation etc so they can tell other buyers about your green and deals. people write reviews on good reputable sellers.<br /><br />Id also reccomend if your just starting out make an OZ your maximum sale amount until you build up. people will be at it etc and you dont wanna get scammed, Stick to oz&#039;s you&#039;l still make a powerload of cash.<br /><br />to get you started il write you a banging review in exchange for a sample :)&nbsp; <br />

				Assuming you&#039;re a us domestic vendor you should consider adding $10-15 gram bags, a lot of the time I overshoot how many bitcoins I&#039;ll need and have some money left over. You can definitely get a few extra buyers with that so that you can get the necessary transactions to FE.

That is extreme, I thought i had it bad. <br />You may be able to offer great deals on the weed but without the proper reviews people will always be wary of buying from you, Even if you are really a decent guy, People wont want to risk their money. You have to co-operate with the buyers in some way in regards to escrow etc, of course it will cost you some money in the short term, But in the long term, You will gain so many customers you&#039;l be run off your ass with sales mate. <br />There isn&#039;t any reason you couldnt do them at that price, i think you would do really well. But what is the actual quality of the bud like?&nbsp; If it&#039;s really good hydro then Great get started. <br /><br />id say stick to what your comfortable with, Dont dive straight into the deep end here with selling Qp&#039;s etc, what if you got scammed by a rogue buyer on your second sale or something for a HP or a QP ? That would heavily affect the way you treat customers and the way you look at the road, It would certainly affect me, I would say start a bit smaller, get a feeling for how it all works first, There is no hurry. Im one of those people that just likes to dive straight in and get doing the hardest thing possible as well, But with things that are risky you really need to take more time.<br /><br />What your packaging like?&nbsp; Dont give me details obviously but is it Good stealth? Because that will get you negative votes as well if you put buyers at risk unnecessarily. Everything factors into your cost, Postage packaging, scams. <br /><br />Really be careful mate. <br /><br />My advice start with good priced ounces, And smaller deals for people to spend loose change, pass out a few free samples to (a) reputable members and (b) Some trustworthy newbs, i know it seems dumb but new buyers are nervous just as much as sellers are selling to them, seeing a few reviews saying you treat your new buyers well is really good publicity.&nbsp; Then sit back for a week or 2 and pile your good reviews and sales up, Then if you wanna sell Qp&#039;s etc go right ahead, Im sure people will welcome it with open arms.<br /><br />Just be careful as a new seller there will be people that know things you haven&#039;t learned yet. <br /><br />all the best and take care (lemme know if you want me to try your product id be more than happy to, Im just back from amsterdam last week So iv got loads to compare it too =D )

I am not sure how to go about listing it in this aspect. Should I mark what the strain is? I won&#039;t *always* be able to guarantee the specific strain, at least until I start ordering myself in larger quantities. I may offer outdoor/indoor organic at a lower price as well, and may throw in a gram to those that don&#039;t buy the hydro so they can see what the higher priced item is really like. My packaging will be among the best, I have no problem shelling out extra bucks on the packaging to make it as stealthy as possible and I have read up on techniques to best do this.<br /><br />I do not want to jump into things. I still have to figure out PGP and everything for my Internet security. I still hope to get set up within the first month though. Is there anything I need to know in regards to how the feedback system works? <br /><br />I will create a special offer when I first get going. How would this sound? -&gt; 2 for 1 with FREE SHIPPING on gram orders, 0.5BTC gets you 2g&#039;s shipped.

				To be honest mate you sound like you&#039;l do absolutely fine. <br />You might want to not bother with anything lowish grade at all, Get your reputation as someone who always has banging weed, and always has the best deals, What more do people want? <br /><br />sounds good, As long as your own internet paper trail is covered, And you package your product well, Have good customer service and Stick to being careful if something dosent feel right, Fuck it. You&#039;l do just fine. <br /><br />start thinking of advanced security once your set up, lie changing addresses every few months whatever you know all that shit. SR probably has all the ebooks for 0.003 BTC with all the info&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />heres a link that Really helped me with PGP. there&#039;s a few bits you might need to read over a couple of times, But you&#039;l have it in no time and once you do you&#039;l never forget like riding a bike.&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp; http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />The deal sounds like a great promo offer, Count me in! As soon as your up and running drop me a PM il be glad to be your first customer and write you up a glowing review if everything&#039;s up to scratch, If it isn&#039;t il give you helpful advice as best i can and You&#039;ll still get a great product review if the buds good and i wont be downtalking you on any forums or any BS like that because everyone has to start somewhere and the fact that your approaching this slowly and carefully is no doubt the best way to do it and iv got nothing but respect for sellers like that.<br /><br />Anyways all the best and i look forward to doing some business with you soon !
