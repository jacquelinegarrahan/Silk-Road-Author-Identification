				Am planning on coming off Suboxone, partly so that I can enjoy the occasional opiate (in moderation I mean) without the lovely euphoria being blocked. So how long will I have to wait before being able to use without any complications?

				3 days at the very minimal. You will be able to get the euphoric feeling, albeit not as intense nor as long in duration. This should be considered a threshold. <br />Suboxone has a 3 day half life so after 3 days half the medication is in your system and in 3 days after that 1/4 of it will be left. But what my friends have told me is after 3 days they get a satisfied &quot;euphoric high&quot; from other opiates. Hope that helps <br />(I&#039;ve been on suboxone for 2 1/2 years if you have any other questions maybe i can help)

				Thanks brother ;)<br />I&#039;ve only been on Suboxone for about a month, was on Subutex for 2 and a half years before that, so it feels that the time is right to attempt not to become a slave to these meds, effective though they are. For me, opiates should be a treat, no more than once (maybe twice lol) a week, not an every day thing. But who am I kidding?!&nbsp; ;D How long before the dreaded Nalaxone has left the building?

				Luckily the amount of naloxone that enters your body via swallowing is small. Although it is enough to keep you from getting high for a few days. The main reason for the naloxone was to curve people from shooting suboxone. It is highly active intravenously and will block the suboxone itself from entering your receptors but at 2mg per sub, that nasty fucker naloxone is weak and in the few days your waiting for the bupe to clear from your receptors, to make way for &quot;other things ;)&quot; there wont be enough in your system to make much of a difference.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m now a slave to suboxone unless a miracle happens i will be on it for life.&nbsp; Not complaining, although i miss getting high, it just is what it is. Have Fun my dude&nbsp;

				I have been on suboxone for almost 8 years and&nbsp; 3 days is a very good estimate, or until you start withdrawal. I have waited 2 and have had no problem.

				I guess the longer I wait, it shows I have got some self-control. Setting a target like 4 days is good, cause it&#039;s a day longer than is necessary.<br /><br />I&#039;m not meaning to suggest that on day 4 i&#039;ll be IVing Pearly White, it&#039;ll be something milder. No need to leap straight back into the deep end! ;)

				It&#039;s 3 days (or 72 hours) until you fully feel the effects of the opiates again.&nbsp; However, as long as you&#039;re on a relatively low dose (lower than, say, 12mgs/day), you will ALWAYS be able to feel the effects of opiates.&nbsp; You just won&#039;t be able to feel them very well.&nbsp; In lower doses, the naloxone doesn&#039;t do such a great job of blocking your opiate receptors.<br /><br />If you can get your hands on some Subutex, I&#039;d just switch to a low dose of that.&nbsp; That way you can feel the opiates properly, without having to put yourself into full-blown withdrawal first.<br /><br />

				Wish I could (go back to low dose Subutex), but some clinics prefer to prescribe only Suboxone. Dunno why. Wouldn&#039;t be that surprised if mine are fibbing to me on that one though.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				In that case, you might want to consider drastically lowering your dose, instead of going off of the Suboxone completely.&nbsp; Like, if you&#039;re on 8 mgs/day, and you plan to use opiates on Friday night, take, say, 4 mgs of Suboxone on Tuesday, 2 mgs on Wednesday, another 2 mgs on Thursday, and then try to go without any more until Friday night. <br /><br />These aren&#039;t necessarily exact numbers, but you get the idea.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be much easier on you than quitting cold turkey for a few days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, if you do decide to reduce your dose, then split the reduced dose into two or three smaller doses, taken 8 to 12 hours apart.&nbsp; For example, if you want to take 4 mgs today, then take 2 mgs in the morning, and another 2 mgs at bedtime.&nbsp; It&#039;s much easier to take less Suboxone when you spread your dose out like that.

				I&#039;ve been on suboxone and subutex for the last 6 years, did opiates for 15+ years.&nbsp; At one point I stayed clean for 6 months and felt so bad I went back to opiates, however, I never was able to get that &quot;good&quot; feeling back.&nbsp; I have managed to come down to 1mg - .5mg of subutex a day with the help of benzo&#039;s and hydro&#039;s (currently have 5 days worth left).&nbsp; I haven&#039;t felt my best, but at the same time I&#039;m not having full blown withdrawals.&nbsp; Occasionally I&#039;ll have muscle spasms at night.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking for 2mg subutex, but have been unsuccessful.&nbsp; If I can offer any advice, I&#039;d be glad to.&nbsp; I wish you all the best Garrincha!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				3-5 days to fully feel an oxy in the way you want to. <br /><br />Anybody know the best way to quickly detox off suboxone? I&#039;ve been taking it for about 3-4 months now but it was given to me oddly.&nbsp; I went to recovery/detox out patient because I knew I needed help with my drug use.&nbsp; I would relapse on oxy 30&#039;s after being clean for a few weeks, sometimes a few months... I hadn&#039;t done any oxy&#039;s in about 2 weeks when all of a sudden I&#039;m on suboxone all the time.&nbsp; I take 1 strip a day (8mg/2mg) but I want to stop taking it. I just don&#039;t want to be dependant on anything.&nbsp; I&nbsp; know the withdrawls from subs are just as bad as oxy&#039;s when you quit cold turkey but I&#039;m wondering how quickly I can lower my dosage and then drop the stuff all together.<br /><br />I think the relapsing on Oxy&#039;s wouldn&#039;t have been such a big deal but all the rules changed where I&#039;m located so they went from being about 8-10 bucks a pop to being 20-30 a pop (thats in bulk)..&nbsp; Its fucking bullshit because it used to be a free for all with those things so if I were to be taking them often, 16-24 bucks a day is a bad habit but it doesn&#039;t absolutely kill my bank account.&nbsp; Now days 50-100 bucks a day is like having an old school heroin habit. Its just not sustainable...<br /><br />Anyways, any suggestions for detoxing off the subs? I took two yesterday so the 2nd one I injested was around 11pm. Its 1130am right now and I feel fine/don&#039;t have any detoxifying effects going through me.&nbsp; I know it stays in your body alot longer so I&#039;m guessing it takes longer for the negative effects to really come on. I&#039;m guessing by 11pm tonight I&#039;ll be feeling kinda crappy and by tomorrow morning I&#039;ll be in full blown withdraw? Fuck suboxone. Its better than being on Oxy&#039;s for sure but with out insurance they&#039;re even more expensive. I&#039;d rather be on 2 20mg OXY OP&#039;s a day. I can give them to my girlfriend and have her leave one out in the morning for me and then give me another one around 5-6pm... I know its sad to have to do that but I&#039;m an addict, if I have a bottle of Oxy&#039;s laying around I&#039;m just going to keep taking them until I&#039;m high as fuck.&nbsp; Luckily I&#039;ve never OD&#039;d or anything like that. I&#039;m a very smart addict. I guess all the dumb addicts quickly find themselfs dead or in jail.

				I dunno about Oxys, but the withdrawl from buprenorphine is meant to be nothing compared to methadone. One common symptom i&#039;ve heard from people who have come off it, is the disturbed sleep pattern/insomnia.<br />I think it depends on who is prescribing for you with regard to how long it takes to wean yourself off. Different clinicians do things differently. Have heard people talk about 2mg every 4 days if you&#039;re starting from an average dose (say 10mg).<br />I&#039;ve found that both Subutex and Suboxone have quite a mental kick to them, even though drug workers/doctors try to convince you otherwise, that there is no recreational value or buzz. They&#039;re altogether unique opioids, different from the others, and I could see the appeal of staying on them for life. And no-one would ever know that you&#039;re on them, unlike smack/methadone.
