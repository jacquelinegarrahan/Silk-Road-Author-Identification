				Hi there!<br /><br />I have a factory connection to many substances (tried and tested, no nonsense, and always discreet).&nbsp; <br />They have some outstanding prices I&#039;d love to share, but how do I do it?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have too much money and they already seem to know how this shipping drugs game is run, so could I open up a Silk Road Vendor account as professional middle man?<br /><br />Here is a list of their products<br /><br /><br />Name<br />Price<br />Methylone(Tried many times, amazing product)<br />MDPV (tried and tested)<br />2c-e(tried and tested)<br />2C-I (tried and tested)<br />MAM2201<br />AKB-48<br />5FAKB-48<br />PB22<br />5FPB22<br />a-pvp (Very good)<br />a-pvt<br />Etizolam (as good as etiz gets)<br />2-Fa<br />4-Fa(excellent)<br />UR-144<br />5FUR-144<br />MN24<br />MN25<br />25iNBOMe(excellent)<br />sts-135<br />Pentedrone<br />Exemestane<br /><br />All of these products that I&#039;ve tested have lived up to their factory claim of 98-99.x% purity claims, only the Methylone has been lab tested by me and it checked out to the tee.&nbsp; All else just passed bio-assay.&nbsp; <br /><br />My question is-&nbsp; &nbsp;What do I do with all this?

				Yippee you have access to a research chemical supply company! Congrats you searched Google and found one that didn&#039;t scam you or rip you off. <br />The SR market is already flooded with very cheap RC&#039;s. This is all useless, unless your buying a LOT or its very CHEAP.

				The 25i-NBOMe is probably the best way to make money. Shipping is easy because of the size of blotters. Depending on where you are, you couldn&#039;t make that much money though.
