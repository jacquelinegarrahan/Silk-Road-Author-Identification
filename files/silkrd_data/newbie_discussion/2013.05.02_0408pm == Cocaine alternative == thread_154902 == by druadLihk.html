				imho there&#039;s no good alternative to good, clean coke. Meth is no good at all and shouldn&#039;t be used unless you don&#039;t give a shit about your life.

				OP, it depends what you do when you&#039;re on coke. If you do work, use regular amphetamines. If you party, try MDMA(Which is harder to get than clean coke, but if you can get clean MDMA, it&#039;s almost better than coke, especially if you&#039;re around people you trust).

				I&#039;ve often heard of crystal meth referred to as &quot;poor man&#039;s coke&quot;.&nbsp; Not having done coke before, I can&#039;t compare, but in my teens I spent about a year doing a LOT of meth.&nbsp; There&#039;s definitely a large effect from the meth, both physiologically and psychologically.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take much to give you the effects (until you build a tolerance) and the effects last quite a while, but it is extremely addictive, and it&#039;s not hard to tell if someone else is on meth or coming down off of it, so you can&#039;t always use it when you have other things to do (esp things that require focus and changing tasks frequently).<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend it as a replacement for coke, because the effects I&#039;ve heard from coke really aren&#039;t the same other than they both speed you up, but the meth rush lasts a lot longer so the next day you&#039;re not going to want to do very much (other than smoke or snort some more meth)

				Interesting theory, the replacement for coke is...coke<br /><br />They are making MPDV as &quot;super coke&quot; now I have not tried this myself and if its anything like those &quot;synthetic cocaine&quot; powders which according to the media is the active ingredient in those products sold at adult stores/head shops etc. If that is true its nothing like coke.<br /><br />People seem to say that &quot;Mephedrone&quot; is like a cross between coke and MDMA, acts on dopamine like coke and also releases serotonin like ecstasy. Obviously coke is fairly distinctive, unless adulterated you wont get the numbing sensation from chemicals like MPDV, Mephedrone or MDMA. Also the way you dose is going to be slightly different - These factors often play on peoples mind more than they probably should when comparing &quot;effect&quot;. Unfortunately the numbing sensation is how a lot of people judge their coke - which really proves very little about its quality.<br /><br />

				Try mcat/meow (mephedrone) limitless and goldust sell the best on the road. <br /><br />It&#039;s brilliant stuff and is as someone mentioned like a mix of Charlie and Molly. I&#039;ve had mates who regularly use Charlie then try meow and wonder what the fuck they were doing never having tried meow. <br /><br />Do yourself a favour and give it a whirl.
