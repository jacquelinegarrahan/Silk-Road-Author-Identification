				Hey all,<br /><br />So seeing all the feed back on PanblosPuro&#039;s stuff I decided to order the social which he said was 60% pure.&nbsp; It had no shine to it, which was fine. I felt no effects from dosages ranging from 70-200mg at a time. I thought it was just me but I did give it to over 10 different people to confirm and no one felt much effects if any. I even convinced two of my friends that don&#039;t ever do ANY drugs whatsoever to try 100mg lines each, and asked if they were high 20 minutes later. &quot;I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t know what to expect&quot; For being advertised at 60% they should be able to feel effects.<br /><br />My theory is that anyone that got the same stuff as me and got high merely felt placebo effects and gets high just from the thought and process of breaking down the brick.<br /><br />Please let me know what you guys think. <br /><br />Also, i&#039;m not some noob trying to ruin this guys reputation. I have great buying stats and lots of experience with many different drugs. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Like I said, maybe the Pure is different and the social wasn&#039;t made with it. But the social is simply not good cocaine. The effects felt are placebo, since posting this i&#039;ve had many different people who are experienced with cocaine try it. I basically gave my 8-ball away hoping that someone would like it..<br /><br />Isn&#039;t cocaine supposed to instantly numb anyways? It takes at least 2 minutes for it to numb my gums after i rub it in.

				Howdy all,<br /><br />This is my very 1st post, anywhere, ever. I fucking hate blobs (Denny Crane&#039;s pronunciation), but since this looks like a good old fashioned BB, I am posting here to put in my $.02 on PP.<br /><br />I ordered 2 G&#039;s of pure, and after about +/- 11 days, it still had not shown up, and my message requesting order status went unanswered for 3 days. Needless to say, I was getting miffed!<br /><br />I clicked on &quot;Resolve&quot;&nbsp; yesterday, Sun, Feb 10th, after getting an auto-message from SR admin, and, low &amp; behold, I not only got a very nice message including a very sincere and honest apology from Pablo, he explained why the delay occurred. He also let me know that my order shipped out late last week, and that I would receive it Monday or Tuesday. It showed up on Monday! <br /><br />The package was nicely stealth, and I&#039;m sure blended very nicely with other postal pieces. The product is as good or better than I&#039;ve ever had, and let&#039;s just say that&#039;s a huge endorsement coming from me. <br /><br />As several veterans have stated on this thread, PP was probably overwhelmed with the order response he got, so I am cutting him slack, and would reorder from him, AFTER he assured me via PM that the order would go out within 2-3 days... <br /><br />I&#039;m loving this road - can&#039;t believe it took me so long to find the path here...<br /><br />Later (or Peace out as you younglings say now),<br /><br />Nick Danger (3rd eye)

				Hi All,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on SR for 9 months and have posted a total of 10 times on these boards. I guess I am still a &#039;noob&#039;.<br /><br />Here is my experience with Pablo. <br /><br />I placed my order for the pure on Thursday. I figured it would get shipped out by Monday. I politely asked Pablo about the status of my order.&nbsp; He told me that he had marked it transit by mistake on Sunday evening.&nbsp; He shipped it out on Wednesday and the package arrived on Friday. Total of 8 days. I am not one to complain about 8 days since I have orders in resolution that are now nearly 40 days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Communication: Pablo has answered everyone of my PMs with respect. It works both ways. If you are respectful asking him about your order, he will respectfully reply. I asked why he has been raising prices and getting rid of his small orders. He said he is trying to slow down the number of orders. The 1gm listings basically cost the same amount of time and effort as his 1 oz listings. <br /><br />Product: Honestly, I would wait 8 weeks for gear.&nbsp; His pure product is that good. I don&#039;t know anything about his social so I can&#039;t really comment on that. I&#039;ve only seen one negative feedback about his social. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried other vendors on the road and some vendors gear is good but nothing I have tried is anything like Pablos.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve ordered from Pablo before (the pure) and it was great stuff. Some of the top-notch shit i&#039;ve ever bought in either real life, or SR. That said, other vendors do offer a similar quality for less, and oftentimes with more prompt shipping.

				Maybe its just me...I live in a major city and blow is easier to get than weed sometimes..both are readily available..but blow usually runs $60 for 1.75. Granted the quality is hit and miss..and I don&#039;t do it much...meth is hard to find and so is just about everything else. But I guess people have a hard time finding it elsewhere and that justifies the steep price...but I can&#039;t imagine a coke worth $300 an 8..but to each his own.
