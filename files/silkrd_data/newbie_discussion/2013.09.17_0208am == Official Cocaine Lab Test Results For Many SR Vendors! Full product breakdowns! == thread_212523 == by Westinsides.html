				I cannot take credit for the below: The user PinappleLove has sorted us out here. Amazing news for anyone interested in SR Coke purchases!<br /><br /><br /><br />Dear cocaine enthusiasts,<br /><br />In this thread you&#039;ll find a list of lab tests results for cocaine. The tested cocaine is acquired either as an anonymous purchase or as an agreement with a vendor. For each listing you will find: publishing date, who tested it, vendor name, name of the advertised product, what method was used to obtain the sample and of course what the results were.<br /><br />I&#039;m as transparent as possible about the tests and always disclose if the sample has been bought anonymously or given by the vendor. Theoretically double blind tests would be best but that isn&#039;t feasible at this point. Please decide for yourself if you want to use the information or not. I refrain from publicly giving comments on cocaine vendors, their shipping methods and their products. I will only post the lab test results. There is no lab documentation available for the cocaine that has been tested.<br /><br />Anonymous testing is the preferred method, but also the most costly. If you&#039;re willing to participate, please send me a message and I&#039;ll give you a btc address to send it to. The bitcoins you send will be used to cover the costs for buying and testing cocaine anonymously only. A big thanks to everyone who has donated so far! Which vendor will be tested anonymously next depends on the preferences of the donators and the bestselling vendors at that moment. It&#039;s not possible to anonymously test vendors that don&#039;t ship to Europe or don&#039;t have a PGP key, please don&#039;t request to test their cocaine. For security reasons I will only test your product if you&#039;re a vendor and support PGP.<br /><br />I&#039;m working together with some other people to receive the cocaine and do the tests. If you&#039;ve done lab tests before and want to join, please contact me. The tests are performed by a Dutch, Belgian or Swiss public lab. If you want to read about how they test in Holland, check this paper : http://www.tediproject.org/uploads/downloads_file_1322466649.pdf<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />&nbsp;PineappleLove<br /><br /><br />Expected results:<br />&nbsp;Nothing at the lab.<br /><br /><br />Please keep in mind that vendors change their product from time to time and quality may vary. Please treat the results as tentative at best, they are by no means a guarantee for what you will get. The cocaine is converted to a base before it&#039;s analyzed, so the maximum purity level is 89%.<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Check http://braqrsskizlusigz.onion/ for a sortable table of all the results (last updated on the 20th of May). Thanks 6DEE3CADA for making this page!<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; There&#039;s a ton of information about vendors, their current listings, finalizing early policies, prices etc. in the &#039;SR Cocaine Vendors

				Very true Cryngie but even if you had the results in front of you on a piece of paper, whats to say the document is real? Trust the community. Many of the above have great reviews that coincide with the actual test results. Other than that you will have to put your believing cap on.

				I like this sort of thing, mainly because I like to see what people are actually selling.<br />I don&#039;t have any experience with these sellers, but good job getting them tested and taking the time to put the results here.

Don&#039;t ask me why they do it this way, because it truly makes no sense, but according to the websites of the testing facilities this is the way the do it!<br /><br />Furthermore, I have tried a couple of the vendors around the same time as pineapple had them tested, and there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these results are legit!<br />Pineapple have been around for a very long time, and because of the consistency between his results, and user experiences, he is generally considered a trusted member of the community.<br /><br />I for one am very grateful for pineapples services. Since he started to do real testing, we have experienced a substantial rise in quality, and I feel quite assured that we owe him some of the credit for this.<br /><br />In fact I doubt that anyone but Koltbiz would have bothered to try selling truly pure coke if it wasn&#039;t for pineapples lab testing!<br /><br />This is of course only my opinion, and I encourage everyone to perform their own comparisons, leading them to reach their own conclusions.
