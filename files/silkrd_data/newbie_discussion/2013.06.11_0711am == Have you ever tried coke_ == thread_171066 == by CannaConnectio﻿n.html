				My first two experiences with coke were underwhelming to say the least. It was shit coke, terrible, terrible nose filler. But then my guy told me about some good stuff, stuff that wasn&#039;t all cut and no coke. I bought a G and it took me flying high, like I expected it too the first time. I was chatty and funny and a bit jittery but it was great. A week and another gram purchase later I was smoking with my dealer when he mentioned he knew where I could get an OZ for $1200. I went home asked my mom to pay me back for gas and my prom dress ( though I bought it already with her credit card). I got 600 or so from her. We atm hopped. Put all our change into cointstar. I even called my little brother asking if he could do me a solid. Three hours later, I find myself in the ghetto. At this point, I was wondering why we decided to drive my new SUV instead of my friend&#039;s beat up car. So as we waited in this neighborhood with hooded people shuffling the streets, my friend went through the possible ways this could go. #1 everything goes as planned, we get the stuff and give him the cash then leave #2 we walk in the house, are shown guns and told to hand over the money #3 The guns are brought out, my friend is told to fuck off and I get a new job as a prostitute (I&#039;m a girl and the seller of the OZ used to be a pimp). The seller finally arrives. As I walk up to the house, I notice that there are two guys standing outside the door for security. When I pass the group of large, drunk, men watching a sports game, I instantly realize I shouldn&#039;t have worn a see through tank dress and why the fuck am I wearing my school saddle oxfords. We go into the back room, and soon after the trade-off is done. One of the larger men slips me a card of some sort, then asks how old I am. Apparently it was a mistake to give my real age since i&#039;m underage. He looks at my shoes and asks where I go to school. I straight up tell him. I mean what are the fucking odds that he would know anyone from there. Fuck odds, because he went to high school with out current dean of discipline. It added some much needed humour to the night
