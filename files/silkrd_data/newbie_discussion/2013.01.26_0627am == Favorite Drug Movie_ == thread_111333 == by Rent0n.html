				Ooh, man. That&#039;s a really tough one. I&#039;ve always liked The Wackness, but everybody always hates on it so much that I&#039;m usually embarrassed to talk about it. It&#039;s got a good soundtrack though. Of course Fear and Loathing is up there. And Limitless was pretty cool. Enter the Void was like the best thing I&#039;d ever seen at the time I saw it but now I can&#039;t even watch it anymore.<br /><br />Anybody ever see Midnight Express? What a mindfuck.

				so yeah, i understand why some people wouldn&#039;t consider limitless a drug movie, however, the reason why it would be considered that way is that this is probably every drug users dream to have happening to them :D<br /><br />Been smoking weed for many years and really enjoyed Smiley Face (2007), however i wouldn&#039;t be able to watch it again.<br /><br />also, I&#039;m gonna go ahead and bring &quot;Dude, Where&#039;s My Car?&quot; into the debate, since it&#039;s not an actual drug movie but more in the &quot;what the hell did i do last night&quot; genre..

				Bad Lieutenant with Harvey Keitel <br /><br />Yeah i know it&#039;s not properly on drugs but you know that man it&#039;s great, i mean every drug movie it&#039;s too much on drugs. In Blow for example it&#039;s like Jung doesn&#039;t have a real life but just pieces of moments of trading drugs and nothing else, you obviously see his family, his love, his anger and so on but it&#039;s always like if they don&#039;t have importance. Instead Harvey makes possible to show the bad and tragic part of an illegal life: debts, death, tears, desperation and just few happy moments.&nbsp;

				I really dislike most drug movies.&nbsp; Blow didn&#039;t make me feel sympathetic to George Jung at all, for example.&nbsp; Scarface didn&#039;t interest me (if you want to call it a &quot;drug movie&quot;).&nbsp; Requim for a Dream was garbage.&nbsp; All the Cheech and Chong movies are stupid.&nbsp; Spun was horrible.&nbsp; A Scanner Darkly was interesting (I never read the novel).<br /><br />Oh by the way, I&#039;m extremely critical and don&#039;t like most movies that I see anyway.<br /><br />Trainspotting or Drugstore Cowboy would be my favourite drug films.<br /><br />Hofmann&#039;s Potion is quite good.<br /><br />Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an excellent book but I had a very hard time understanding what Johnny Depp was saying during the movie.&nbsp; I still like the movie, but I don&#039;t really consider it to be &quot;about drugs&quot; per se.&nbsp; Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of the few books that has made me laugh out loud (so have a few other of Hunter S Thompson&#039;s writings).

				I guess its pretty cliche, but I loooove Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Next to that, I really really liked Blow (Johnny Depp was a badass man!) and the MDMA version of pulp-fiction, Go. Pineapple Express was pretty hilarious.<br /><br />Also, less of a &quot;drug&quot; movie but a movie that starts off with the main character hitting some DMT, Enter The Void is CRAZY fucking movie. You&#039;ll spend the entire time questioning and contemplating the charming oddness of this movie. Just to give you an idea, the director called it a &quot;Psychedelic melo-drama&quot;.

The LSD scene was great as well....as far as a drug movie, not sure, just very good and entertaining.

				Savages, and even better - WINTER&#039;S BONE! That movie is a work of art!<br /><br />I also want to mention a great movie called &quot;Oxy-morons.&quot; Be warned, this movie is NOT meant to be an honest portrayal of opiate addiction or the drug world - I remember reading angry posts about how people hate this movie for making oxy users look like psychopaths. I myself love opiates and think they are a beautiful thing, but I also love ultra stylized violent crime films. Yeah, the guy that made the movie is probably kind of a jackass but I really really had a great time watching this movie! It&#039;s very fast paced and weaves a lot of plot points together pretty well in my opinion. If you are into crime dramas/thrillers I think it&#039;s a great film. I hope I don&#039;t get hate comments for this haha.

I adored Enter the Void and the tripping sequence at the beginning is one of the better representations of drug-induced visuals I&#039;ve seen. <br /><br />And Liquid Sky.. OMG. I don&#039;t if I&#039;d call it a &#039;drug movie&#039; per se, but it does have plenty of drug use and crazy 80s dancing. Everybody involved in the making of this movie was probably on drugs, and it must be seen while on drugs to be truly appreciated. :)<br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend the Pusher trilogy (the Danish films by Nicolas Winding-Refn). Their portrayal of small time drug dealers and ethnic gangs in Europe always seemed incredibly realistic to me, although I wouldn&#039;t really know otherwise. Brilliant characters and great actors too. <br />

				Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece. Aronofsky is a great filmmaker in general. When it comes to trippy movies that are not directly linked to drugs then &quot;the Fountain&quot; is absolutely amazing. Missed it? Get it NAU!<br /><br />Best musical &quot;drug&quot; movie would be Across the Universe, the Beatles-musical ;)

				Story of a Junkie. Pretty strange film here. It&#039;s shot cinema verite style, camera following junkies as they shoot dope, crash in squats, puke in toilets,&nbsp; pass muggers, and otherwise carry on in the ingamously mean and rotted out streets of the Lower East Side. There&#039;s no judgement. There&#039;s little narrative. Why should there be? Hopes dreams and inspiration, yes? If there&#039;s a narrative, there&#039;s some kind of actual motion in these people&#039;s lives. But no. Looks like they&#039;re just reacting, day by day, like pinballs in a machine with fucked up flippers.<br /><br />It does have stupid, sensational faked scenes spliced in. But most of its real. Watch the lead tie a turniquet around his arm and boot, blood sliding out his arm. Lovely. Watch him vomit profusely into a toilet, profusely dope sick. Lovelier yet. Watch people who aren&#039;t sure where their next fix will come from chopping up hundreds of thousands of dollars of H in decayed room with peeling wallpaper. Plain nuts. Meet the man who&#039;s selling several K a day in heroin. With inflation, I think that&#039;s about 10 thousand US a day. That&#039;d be about 1/7th Sr&#039;s reputed volume per month, and all by *one* dealer. My!<br /><br />No wonder the fucking city burned... to the ground.

				There&#039;s so may of them, but it depends on if the movie, itself, has drugs in it, or if the movie is so f*cked up that it&#039;s awesome to watch on drugs.

What a soundtrack too.&nbsp; Take a bong hit every time that weird ass like kid Mitch touches his nose!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;d be a good smoking game, especially because he touches it multiple times in some scenes.

				Maybe a bit cliché but Requiem for a dream would have to be my favourite movie about drugs. One of my favourite movies to watch while on drugs is probably The Machinist or American Psycho (slight man crush on Christian Bale, although they are great films nonetheless). Trainspotting is another great movie about drugs, depicts not only the &#039;apparent&#039; devastation drugs cause but also adds comedy to the mix.

				I gotta pop in here and yak some more. There is a difference between favorite &quot;drug movie&quot; and favorite movie to watch while high. Fear and Loathing are both, but I think with the settings, the music, the extreme variances in scenes, Pulp Fiction tickles them all, very nicely....

				David Lynch&#039;s Dune!&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen it countless times with my father, we both adore it.&nbsp; Not only is a great film *about* drugs but it&#039;s also pretty fantastic to watch stoned.<br /><br />It&#039;s simultaneously awesome and hilarious.&nbsp; Some of the line readings are so bizarre and mannered I still crack up.&nbsp; The scene with the Guild Navigator (the giant floating worm that folds space, not to be confused with the sand worms) is fantastic.&nbsp; He leaves the Emperor&#039;s palace in that oldey-timey steam locomotive vessel and his minions mop up the slime he leaves on the floor as it slides away -- it&#039;s all so wonderfully Lynchian.<br /><br />The spice melange, the poison at the end of the gom jabbar needle, the juice of Sapho, the water of life.&nbsp; DRUGS, DRUGS, DRUGS!<br /><br />I know I&#039;m in the minority, adoring that film but it&#039;s worth watching for the costume and art deco-esque set design alone.&nbsp; Cult classic.<br /><br /><br />(And kudos to the people in the thread that mentioned Liquid Sky, Bad Lieutenant, Paprika and Enter the Void.&nbsp; All fantastic!!)

Big Lebowski.&nbsp; &nbsp; The scene where the dude lights up a j in big lebowskis office is great plus Julianne Moore naked.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />best movie to watch stoned ........

				Requiem For a Dream- one of my top 3 favorite movies<br />Donnie Darko- not really a drug movie but such a mindfuck when your high (if you can still follow it when high anyways)<br />Smiley Face- i think thats what its called (not the new horror movie but the stoner flick from like 2000ish). saw it for the first time a couple years ago with my sister and we still quote it to this day lol. this is hands down my favorite movie of all time, so relatable if you&#039;ve had some good stoned adventures. not a well known movie but i definately recommend seeing. <br />and the new alice in wonderland was fucking beautiful on low dose dxm (i fucking love dxm. and paranthesis.)<br />im a bit of a movie buff and a really avid drug user, i could go on for hours on this subject

				Don&#039;t know if these have been mentioned.<br /><br />A couple movies that, in my opinion, aren&#039;t well known. <br /><br />&quot;Homegrown&quot; John Lithgow, Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Hank Azaria, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi<br /><br />&quot;Bongwater&quot; Luke Wilson, Brittany Murphy, Andy Dick,&nbsp; Jack Black, Jamie Kennedy, etc...<br /><br />These are worth a watch at least once, instead of watching the major ones that you&#039;ve already seen a million times.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Requiem for a Dream. <br /><br />Because of the impact it had on me. Though I know it has inaccuracies / exaggerations. I don&#039;t see it as an anti-drug film like some critics, it just uses drugs as a plot device. <br /><br />But.. its too difficult to watch very often -- much like any quality drama film. <br /><br />Poor poor Sara Goldfarb :( <br /><br />Those who avoided it cause they think its some anti-drug propaganda piece, please give it a shot and when you see the ending you&#039;ll understand the plot is open to multiple interpretations. Don&#039;t watch if you&#039;re clinically depressed or on a psychostimulant binge... lol.... JUICED BY SARA WEEEE HAVE A WINNER

				I&#039;m really surprised no one else has mentioned Bongwater.&nbsp; Can&#039;t go wrong with Jack Black and gang shroom hunting while tripping on acid!&nbsp; LoL.&nbsp; Yeah, it&#039;s not the BEST drug movie out there, but it&#039;s a decent ride.&nbsp; Yeah, I like Blow, fear and loathing, trainspotting, pineapple express, etc.. too; but not every single time I want to watch a movie about drugs.&nbsp; Page after page of Blow, Blow, Fear and loathing, blow, blow, blow, fear and loathing, etc... is funny.&nbsp; I guess I saw the thread title as &quot;Favorite Drug Movie(s)&quot;&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Oh, and Homegrown too!

				Enter the Void has a slight psychedelic feel to it.<br /><br />Strange Days is a classic drugs film. Even thought it&#039;s not about drugs. It really is though.<br /><br />For TV american dad is classic while stoned. The British TV show Peep Show is brilliant for drug references; my go to come down show after tripping on psychedelics.

				I went through a few pages of this thread and didn&#039;t see any mention of Party Monster. Ya&#039;ll should watch that, it&#039;s a fucking fantastic movie. Amazingly strange, but really, really good. Do it!<br />Also, Blow, Spun, Requiem for a Dream, DMT the Spirit Molecule, many more I probably forgot about.

				I LOVE &quot;SAVAGE&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s the Real DRUG and DRUG DEALER Movie, despite the Triangle Love that make more interesting for some people who love drama &amp; action.

				Blow is pretty underrated and awesome. I really enjoyed that.<br />Thought it was relevant as I have somewhat of a cocaine fetish as of late.

				Did anyone say Alice In Wonderland?? <br />Not necessarily a favorite but definitely a drug movie. <br /><br />I&#039;ve watched A Lot of movies high so I can&#039;t remember a bunch of them but Pineapple Express for comedy and Traffic for...not comedy, are the ones that come to mind<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream was really really good but kind of a bummer<br /><br />And Yes, I gotta admit, I liked Dude, Where&#039;s My Car. I didn&#039;t wanna like it...but I did&nbsp; ???

				Fear and Loathing, but Trainspotting is very close to that. . . there are other pretty good ones ( didn&#039;t see Human Traffic mentioned , it has some good MDMA moments ) , but most drug movies are not as complete as those two . . .

				As far as &quot;obvious&quot; answers go 2001: A Space Odyssey and Smiley Face are both amazing films for watching intoxicated. <br /><br />But in general I find really the best &quot;drug&quot; movies are the ones that aren&#039;t trying so hard to be trippy, pandering, or what have you. Too many winks and nods or just generally blatant movies in that regard can take away from the experience.

				Not sure if this one was mentioned yet (haven&#039;t been following this thread and don&#039;t have the time to read all 20 pages) but by far one of my new favorites is Oxymorons.&nbsp; It is on Netflix, and if you haven&#039;t seen or heard of it, seriously watch this movie today.&nbsp; Anyone that is/was addicted to Opiates will have a special attraction to this movie.&nbsp; This move is about the craze started by the release of Oxycontin and is a true story.&nbsp; The movie was written and produced by one of the brothers of the largest string of pharmacy robberies for OC&#039;s and takes place in Boston, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Being originally from New England, this movie had a large impact on me, as it was the same progression of drugs that I went through - Pharmies, to OCs, to H.&nbsp; I have been on Methadone Maintenance for a long time, and haven&#039;t used any Opiates since the day I got on the clinic.&nbsp; For those in their early recovery, this movie may be a trigger so be careful.&nbsp; Again, if you haven&#039;t seen this movie - watch it asap.

				Fear and Loathing tops my list. Great read when I was 15 or so. Anyone see Over The Edge? Matt Dillon&#039;s first film I think. I was coming of age when that one came out. It had that same realistic feel as Dazed and Confused which is another favorite.

				Oh there are many.<br />My first Fav was The Doors. Not really a drug movie, but not far from it.<br />Fear and Loathing is a classic<br />Trainspotting of course.<br />the old hippie movie Hair.<br /><br />I also love to watch studio Ghibblis movies while on weed etc. <br />They may not be drug movies, but they go great with some ganja. (Tell em what doesn&#039;t...)
