				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				Medicinewoman...nothing about you sounds remotely legit...<br /><br />You set up a vendor account to sell a pdf guide to bitcoin...the cost of which is zero...(you ask or 0.02 btc voluntary donation)...how do you intend to recoup your roughly $500 vendor bond...?<br /><br />You have exactly one publication...the bitcoin guide...yet you call it a &quot;featured listing&quot;...<br /><br />One of the more astute reviewers of your guide says you instruct the user to connect to a site while not connected to tor...HUH...?...why in the world would you want to reveal your physical location by going off tor...?<br /><br />The same reviewer advises caution...&quot;buyer beware for now...&quot;<br /><br />I am just dying to hear the answers to these questions...

				And just to put the final nail in the coffin...<br /><br />If I or anyone else in this community had written something useful and worthwhile that they wanted to share...the most effective and obvious method would be to put it up as a post on the forum here...lots of good examples...several of which have stickies attached and have been read thousands of times...<br /><br />Yet here you come along...setting up an expensive vendor account to sell one free piece of advice...asking for real name and address and telling people to go off tor...<br /><br />You must think people are pretty stupid...<br /><br />I think you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with something a little more believable...<br /><br />

				I think TopShelf&#039;s concerns are interesting, but not well founded. I also think anyone on the forum who doesn&#039;t go in with a suspicious mind is crazy. But think people. Think. And inform yourselves.<br /><br />Anyone who has run a business knows that you give things away all the time. For a variety of reasons: publicity; to create goodwill; to get name recognition, community trust; and, yes, as a marketing technique to increase your bottom line. $500 is very little investment compared to the huge returns possible in this marketplace. I could easily spend $6,000 setting up an ecommerce site on Clearnet, for far smaller returns.<br /><br />More on the theory that I&#039;m LE is in TopShelf&#039;s post, are on his thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=169398.0<br /><br />Anyhow, thanks for the input, I welcome it all. I don&#039;t have time to reply to all of it, as I&#039;ve got other fish to fry, but hope all who walk on the Road walk with as much care as topshelf.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MW<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t trust anyone giving you links to external websites. That&#039;s just foolish.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to get BTC. Go to bitinstant, select walmart (or whatever store you want) to BTC address, fill in your information and how much you want to pay, print off the sheet, take it to walmart, and ask the help desk for how to perform a moneygram transaction (make sure to indicate that it&#039;s for a bill, not a person to person transfer). Trust me, the person at walmart will help you once you get to that point - all you need is the money to pay for the moneygram transfer. If they ask what it&#039;s for, answer rent money. Or that you&#039;d rather not talk about it. Or you&#039;re helping out a friend. Or anything, they&#039;re walmart employees - they&#039;re there to help you get a moneygram transfer through, not interrogate you on what you&#039;re doing. It&#039;s insanely easy, you can even use your SR BTC address to send the money to, or you can set up an external address to send it to and then send it to SR.

				Just a note about my latest Bitinstant BTC purchase.&nbsp; I chose CVS pharmacy here in the US and used a fake name, address and phone number.&nbsp; I entered the information in the red phone.&nbsp; After entering the amount, receive code and account number in the automated system, I was transferred to a real person who took my name, address and phone number.&nbsp; They would not complete the transaction without an address (I asked), so I used a fake one.<br /><br />Then I took the info and my cash to the cashier.&nbsp; They would not complete the transaction without seeing govt.&nbsp; ID.&nbsp; I said I was doing it for a friend and they said no without an ID.&nbsp; At this point I had to abandon the transaction.&nbsp; A fake ID would have been helpful.&nbsp; I think the CVS ID thing might be a corporate policy so keep that in mind if you use them.<br /><br />The next day I redid a Bitinstant transaction with my real ID information.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done clearnet BTC purchases before so I wasn&#039;t too concerned about anonymity.&nbsp; This time I went to Shaw&#039;s supermarket.&nbsp; They had no red phone.&nbsp; The customer service person took my name, address and phone number along with my money and completed the transaction without looking at ID.&nbsp; The BTC were in my wallet by the time I got home.<br /><br />So if you are going this route make sure to use a Moneygram agent that will not be asking for ID.&nbsp; If you use fake information and don&#039;t have an ID to match you might not be able to complete the transaction.&nbsp; CVS policy is to make sure the ID matches the first and last name of the Moneygram transaction.&nbsp; The cashier&#039;s screen only showed first and last name - no address or phone.

				I too went to a walmart that did not have a red phone, and the clerk did not ask for an ID. I used my real information because I actually do use BTC legitimately in part, but they never asked for an ID. You can always say you forgot your ID and try again, like the previous poster did.<br /><br />But back on topic: DON&#039;T DOWNLOAD SHIT FROM PEOPLE YOU DON&#039;T KNOW WITH NO REPUTATION ON AN ANONYMOUS WEBSITE.

				Unfortunately I have no advice at all.&nbsp; Most document delivery systems need to issue unique URLs assigned at purchase.&nbsp; If you just link customers to a static link then there is nothing stopping the buyer from sharing the link with their friends.&nbsp; Actually you can&#039;t really stop that even if you use unique and temporary URLs.&nbsp; The docs can be copied and shared.<br /><br />Hosting docs only on Tor helps from the perspective of the security of the buyer and seller.&nbsp; But you can&#039;t solve the problem of people copying the information and sharing.&nbsp; If there were an answer to that then RIAA would be using it.<br /><br />For something like Bitcoin perhaps a subscription service might work.&nbsp; Since things change quickly in the Bitcoin world , maybe you can offer a regular subscription to paying members.<br /><br />Good luck with your venture.<br />

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
