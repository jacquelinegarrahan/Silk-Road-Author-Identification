				Localbitcoins on the clearnet sometimes lists sellers who&#039;ll take Paypal or Venmo<br /><br />But it&#039;s usually for ass-pounding prices.

				Yikes.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have a VERY difficult time finding anyone reputable who accepts credit card payments for bitcoins.&nbsp; They&#039;d be stupid to because it&#039;s far too easy to reverse the payment and scam them.

				My advice would be to follow this easy Ten Step Method:<br /><br />1. Walk or drive to the nearest Walmart, CVS, 7 Eleven, or Walgreens, go to the ATM<br /><br />2. Withdraw the amount of money you wish to convert to Bitcoins in cash<br /><br />3. Walk/drive to the nearest McDonalds, Panera Bread, or Starbucks<br /><br />4. Use their public WiFi to access https://www.bitinstant.com (https://www.bitinstant.com)<br /><br />5. Select Cash Deposit as the &quot;From&quot;<br /><br />6. Select Bitcoin to Email as the &quot;To&quot;<br /><br />7. Print to file (use CutePDF if using Windows)<br /><br />8. Walk/drive home, print the invoice from BitInstant onto paper<br /><br />9. Drive/walk back to the Walmart, CVS, 7 Eleven, or Walgreens, hand them the invoice, and pay them the cash.<br /><br />10. Deposit the Bitcoins you should have received at your Tormail address to your Silkroad receiving address, and enjoy!<br /><br />PROTIP: If you are extra paranoid, a bonus step would be to use a public wifi network (such as that of McDonalds, Panera Bread, or Starbucks) to register a NEW Yahoo.com email address, then supply that to BitInstant to send the Bitcoins to, then never use that email address again for anything else.<br /><br />I hope this helps you.

				I don&#039;t see why so much paranoia behind acquiring Bitcoins. They are used for a lot of legitimate things too, you know. Besides, digital currency isn&#039;t outlawed. Besides, bitcoin transactions aren&#039;t easily traceable. <br /><br />Unless you hand over all your account info to the police, there&#039;s no chance this can be used against you.<br /><br />You&#039;re just making it harder on yourselves by being paranoid. And then, by acting paranoid and going out in public to jump thru hoops to get the &#039;coins, attracting unwanted attention.<br /><br />I purchase my &#039;coins entirely online thru a verified account. So what? Been doing that for years and nobody said shit.

Do you just ignore that and hope no one connects any dots?<br /><br />Also bitfloor is dead now.
