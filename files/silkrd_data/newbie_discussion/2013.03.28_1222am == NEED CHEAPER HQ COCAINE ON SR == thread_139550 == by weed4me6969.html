				Alright guys, I need to find some of the best stuff on here.&nbsp; I am not a coke head by any means, and actually only enjoy the most pure clean HQ cocaine as it differs so much from the cut up stuff.&nbsp; Anyways, can we PLEASE get someone on SR with a little better prices?&nbsp; I cant believe that i can find anything on SR for better prices than street, except blow.

				imo the cocaine section on SR is the one thats hurting the most. i don&#039;t use it much but know people who are coke enthusiasts and they all have said for the really high prices the coke is never worth it. they can get better stuff on the street for much less money.

				Within the next few weeks I will be throwing samples onto my SR account for my HQ cocaine from bolivia, columbia, and peru. My prices will be much cheaper than any competitor out. Please keep an eye out for CannaConnection in the upcoming weeks. Plus, we have an entire HQ and mid quality weed available straight from CA growers. All samples will be up in a few weeks time!!!<br />I will only be selling samples for the different types of coke starting at a gram or less. That way customers can learn to trust us and tell that we are the real deal. I will be constantly testing our coke with ez test cocaine purity and cut tests so everyone can make informed decisions. With marijuana I will probably be able to start samples at 1/8ths or less. <br /><br />Everyone keep a look out. We hope to be the number 1 vendor on SR with our business plan and connections we have.<br /><br />CannaConnection looks foward to supplying all your marijuana and coke needs at better prices across the board!

				Could the price of good coke not just have gone up all the way up the line, to production? It&#039;s been over 12 /13 years since I&#039;ve had nice coke, even then, I had to pay Â£50 for the good stuff, ten pounds over the going rate of the &quot;normal&quot; sniff.<br />Pinballwizard, may I ask, what are your general purchases on here? Putting your stats in your signature shows that you&#039;ve spent a lot in a relatively short time. !&#039;m just being nosey, but, you did put them up. Obviously, I shan&#039;t be offended if you chose not to share.&nbsp; ;)

				i am afraid i have to agree mainly.<br /><br />what i purchased on SR so far (only from vendors sending from germany) in a couple of month was at best mediocre quality.<br />i have never had GOOD quality here.<br /><br />however, in some cases it was acceptable and good enough that i bought it again.<br /><br />only, the sellers dont stick to their quality, they usually get worse batches every now and then.<br />(means : most dont have bigger amounts).<br /><br />once i get a bad batch, i quit until the seller tells me a new batch is on.<br />if it is bad again (a second time - i quit buying from that seller completely).<br /><br />many sellers though try to lie to you and tell you it has been the same stuff.<br />in cases like this, i never buy again from such a seller, because they are lyers and probably send you a little better<br />only at first time.&nbsp; never buy there again !&nbsp; even if they are skilled lyers.<br /><br />some even try to tell you that you have no idea about coke.<br />in my case i laugh about it, since i do coke since 30 years, and there were heavy years in the beginning ... :-)<br /><br /><br />BUT even if the quality is acceptable, it is still very EXPENSIVE, and this is not only through the high percentage of 5-10% that<br />SR grabs, but also to high rates from the sellers&nbsp; (my experience tells me that cheap sellers on SR sell very low quality, if&nbsp; you want a<br />chance to acceptable stuff, stick to there more expensive ones, which is NO guarantee, though ! ).<br /><br />be aware : many are very skilled in explaining why it isnt that good in the moment. <br />do not listen to any excuses. <br />if it is bad, skip to another seller.&nbsp; <br />if noone is left - thats it.<br />you may return in a month, or just hit the street.<br /><br />your chance on the street is at least equal, if not better.<br />yes, first you go through some low quality, but sooner or later you find the better stuff.<br />and if it is only to grab a local junkie and offer him 1g (or a bit more) if he leads you to good quality.<br />if you do that twice or tiple, you usually find something.<br /><br />i think, your chances on the street are better, and of course it is cheaper (you get more for less).<br /><br /><br />i wouldnt say there is no chance to get better stuff on SR, but it is a matter of luck, and you need big luck,<br /><br />i havent made chemical tests and those offered here a no good, as they test for certain cut material only.<br /><br />and still, the percentage of coke isnt all.<br /><br />do not believe any 75% or even higher percentage statements, they are not true.<br />even if they show you a report, it only means that they have had such good coke once maybe,<br />but after they cut it 1:4 and after you get it, it has not even a quart of what was promised.<br />i would guess the majority of coke here on SR (at least that sent from germany) to no more than 10 or 15 % at max..<br />you are probably lucky if you get that.<br /><br /><br />but then again :<br /><br />dont forget that the coke percentage is not all, it doesnt tell you if the coke is REALLY good.<br />beside that those high percentage promises are all false, the percentage is not all :<br /><br />it is like with good wine.<br /><br />only a skilled drinker can keep good wine apart from cheap wine.<br />the percentage of alcohol in the wine doesnt say a lot.<br /><br />it surely doesnt tell you if a wine is good or not.<br />to tell that, you simply need experience.<br /><br />and it is the same with cocaine.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Please keep an eye out everyone. My cocaine will be the highest quality for far cheaper than the other vendors on here. There will be even different qualities and prices based on the tests I do. But, I am sure all of my product will be either 4 star or 5 star which is the highest on those ez tests for purity!<br /><br />Samples will allow everyone to get a taste for what I am truly about!

				Cmos, please keep a lookout for me on the road. I will be able to give you columbian, peruvian, or bolivian cocaine that will be able to take you back to the 80&#039;s. On top of that I will be doing purity tests and cut tests for each new type of cocaine I pick up. You can make an informed decision with up to date pictures that you can see for yourself. Right now I can advise to pick up my bolivian cocaine which will be the best quality out of all. I am sure though that all my different types will be 4/5 or 5/5 purity levels though. Since there is literally no middle manning on my end. Keep that eye open and you won&#039;t be disappointed in cannaconnection!

I am assuming that you want a tester of the best product out of my selection? I could also probably send you some of my other options. They are all very comparable to my top dog bolivian stuff. But, since they come from different countries they all tatse slightly different. Would you be interested in a couple tastes? This is my 50th post so I am about to take this advertising campaign out to the regular threads.

I will be able to give you columbian, peruvian, or bolivian cocaine that will be able to take you back to the 80&#039;s. On top of that I will be doing purity tests and cut tests for each new type of cocaine I pick up. You can make an informed decision with up to date pictures that you can see for yourself. Right now I can advise to pick up my bolivian cocaine which will be the best quality out of all. I am sure though that all my different types will be 4/5 or 5/5 purity levels though. Since there is literally no middle manning on my end. Keep that eye open and you won&#039;t be disappointed in cannaconnection!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thanks, I&#039;ll be looking out for that and for Japan&#039;s review also. It would be nice if you had sample listings first so we can have a taste of it without investing too much money. No offense intended but with new vendors we have to be cautious.<br />

				Cmos, As soon as I place my vendor deposit you will start to see sample listings. The highest will be g&#039;s. The lowest will probably be .2&#039;s and a mix in the middle. I want your guys trust! WE can start out very small and work up the trust from there. CannaConnection is doing it right!

				I&#039;ve never gotten coke on SR but I guess the going rate is $50/g (US prices) on the street. You think its better quality on SR where its not stomped on?

				Unfortunately coke on the streets now a days that is 50-60 is not typically that good. In Miami even. For the best coke though it is going to cost 60-100. The coke I will be able to supply will put you in a time warp where you are in the 80&#039;s again. But those are full retail street prices. Vendors that sell white on here that are charging 150-180 are getting middlemaned or just getting ripped off to begin with. Also, I don&#039;t see any vendor that can get cocaine from different countries like I can. Hence, me not being ripped off. In order for someone to be able to do that it means that they have REALLY good connections.

				unless its acetone washed pure, its not worth buying on the SR unless its for shits and giggles.. Besides, most people think that &quot;pure&quot; is a rip off, but its so much higher quality than whats on the streets, you could almost turn a gram into an 8 ball and it still be comparable to street shit in some places. <br /><br />i wont buy it

I will be doing purity and cut tests on my products as well. But I am going to have an awesome opening sale so everyone will be able to buy a gram or less for cheap. Keep an eye out on the non newbie forum sections because I am going to be sending out 4 free samples to USA buyers that have a decent forum presence. Each of the samples that I send out for free on condition of writing me a review will contain 3 different types of coke from 3 different countries. .2 of each kind so everyone that gets the sample can have a great night on top of their reviews. I cannot wait to work with all you guys!

				Cocaine on the road to expensive and not so good?<br />When i read some threats with laptests from pineapple, where sukeyÂ´s and&nbsp; bungeeÂ´s stuff have around 83 - 87 % i think it could be great stuff.<br />On the the streets in germany you get bullshit with maybe maximum 20 % cocaine, cut with a lot off ampethamine and lidocaine.<br />Then you pay 100â¬ per gram and the buyers are happy,because they didnÂ´t now the good stuff...<br />ItÂ´s very hard to get a good, cheap and honest connection.<br />When you got it you could be happy and only pay 30 to 50 â¬ per gram on 1000 gram.<br />But this is most only happened with much luck.<br /><br />I would pay a good price for good qualitity.

				CannaConnect, I have bought from a couple of vendors on the road, and been very dissappointed....if u could change my opinion of blow on the road, it would be a wonderful thing.&nbsp; let me know how your product tests out at and if you are indeed going to send samples, i would consider trying it, but dont like wasting packages on such little shit so.... maybe we could think of somethin&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;pm me

				I posted something similar just yesterday.&nbsp; I completely agree with you.&nbsp; Where Im at, pretty high quality blow goes for around 80 a G.&nbsp; 100 at most.&nbsp; and balls go for 200-225, 250 if its really killer stuff.&nbsp; but, that&#039;s the price you pay for convenience I suppose.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp; If you find any awesome deals from some reputable sellers, send me a link, lol.
