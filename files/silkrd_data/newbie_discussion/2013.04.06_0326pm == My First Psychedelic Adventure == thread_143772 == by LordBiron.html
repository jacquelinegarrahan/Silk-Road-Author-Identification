				Hey SR, so I got 4g T. Leary shrooms and this is my first time doing anything other than bud knowingly so I am pumped! I have a great friend coming over to sit me and I plan on taking 1.5g is that too much or to little for my first time. I will take it on an empty stomach and have a vomit bin ready just in case. I plan on sitting on the couch or maybe walking to my local park (5 min walk) and just enjoy these shrooms. Tell me what should I expect, I am in a very good frame of mind and at peace but if I have a bad trip how can I combat it without going to the ER <br /><br />Thanks guys <br /><br />-Lord Biron

				I think that you should be with people that are also tripping, it&#039;d be better for a first time. Sober people are sorta scary on shrooms in my experience, they feel weird, but if you know the guy well maybe it won&#039;t be a problem. If you have a bad trip the person with you can assist you, he should be able to distract you from bad thoughts, you can also do things like take a shower and if it&#039;s really too bad and nothing works you should take some benzos. But 1.5g isn&#039;t enough to have a real bad trip, the only thing that can be unpleasant is the come up with all the nausea and stuff, weed can help for that though, or ginger.

				Well puking is rare from shrooms but the nausea is there and it can turn the trip to a mildly bad one, that&#039;s why cancelling it out with a little weed or ginger tea is better! But I don&#039;t think you won&#039;t have a nice trip, you seems like you&#039;re in the right mindset. Going to a park is a good idea, but don&#039;t go where it&#039;s too cold, shrooms usually make you a little cold so.. If you&#039;re staying home I also recommend having very soft things on you like silk (lol), because it feels amazing on shrooms :)

				Hey there Lord Biron!<br /><br />First off man hope you have a great time.... or are having a great time if you already ate them...<br />but I would suggest eating more than 1.5.&nbsp; That seems like a pretty small dose...&nbsp; 2 also seems small but if you like the feeling then you can go ahead and eat the other 2 grams after an hour or so... a 4 gram trip should give you a good feel for what a good shroom trip should be like....<br /><br />I always have ginger around for the trip....if at home then ginger tea... if I am tripping outside and I do that a lot! then a small bottle of ginger ale ( made with real ginger! ).&nbsp; <br /><br />Please write back and let us all know how your trip went.&nbsp; Like the other poster said you might get cold, I always do while tripping.&nbsp; If you are happy with your trip I suggest you try out some of Cyclones Penis Envy mushrooms.&nbsp; Also the Mutant variety of the same strain... They are to date the most potent shrooms I have ever eaten....<br /><br />Good luck and and happy tripping<br /><br />mm

				I think LSD is an easier trip than mushrooms.&nbsp; With LSD I have always had way more visuals than with shrooms.&nbsp; While shrooms I have always had more mind melting thoughts.<br /><br />So for your first time.... yes try LSD.&nbsp; Then if you like it try some mushrooms.... then if you enjoy that you might want to try DMT..... but watch out with that one as it is pretty intense to say the least....<br /><br />happy tripping....

				1.5g mushrooms will not make you feel sick at all. With 1.5g your thoughts will be altered and you will see brighter colors, halos around light fixtures, mild euphoria generally a good time that isn&#039;t hard to handle. You won&#039;t see anything really trippy.<br /><br />Now if you ate all four grams I think that would be a good amount. You will see tesilations and things will have trippy visuals. You might feel a little neausia for the beginning but it passes after 30 to 60minutes. Eating more than 4g the neausia will become more of a problem.<br /><br />If its your first time don&#039;t smoke weed while coming up on the shrooms. It will take the experience into the stratosphere. I had a friend who ate 3.5g and he was still coming up on them (he had done them one other time) and it really overwhelmed him. <br /><br />It sounds like your plan is perfect dude. If your really worried just take the 1.5g. I did that my first time and I had a really killer time. Since you have a sitter take advantage and eat all 4g. You will have a great time.<br /><br />Mixing psychedlics with weed has gotten me in trouble a few times. The amounts are hard to gauge and its easy to over do it. I would say that after the peak of 1.5g you could totally hit a pipe and it would make it more interesting. With the 4g dose you don&#039;t need anything else.<br /><br />Grind it into a powder and mix it into something you like to eat, I use ice cream. If you want to super charge the shrooms drink orange juice.<br /><br /><br />On the topic of Salvia. Most people do it once or twice and are scared shitless by it. Its like doing anything scary. You have to do it many times before you start to relax and have fun and play with the trip. I was one of the weirdos who had a great time right off the bat, so I&#039;ve always liked salvia. If someone really wants to explore salvia. You have to go balls deep and commit to doing it many times, then its a real blast.<br /><br />

				Oh I forgot to talk about what to do for a bad trip. Really there is nothing you can do. If you have a trip sitter that person&#039;s willingness to help you is your antidote for a bad trip. If you are freaking out they should just be talking to you and helping you along. They need to help you realize that what you are experiencing is just a drug effect that will wear off and you will be back to normal.<br /><br />I have books that doctors and nurses use for treating patients who come in on drugs (just like in pulp fiction). The section on psychedelics is really really short. The only thing they can give you if you went to the E.R. would be Valium. For people who are freaking the fuck out on a bad trip all the E.R. can do is try to calm the person and give them a Valium. The LD 50 for psychedelics (which is half the amount it takes to kill someone is really really high for psilocybin and LSD). These chemicals cannot kill you. For psilocybin the LD 50 on a rabbit is 12.5mg/kg so if you weigh about 70Kg that means you would need 875mg. Keep in mind thats 87% of a gram of pure crystalline psilocybin!!!!!<br /><br />Psilocybin only makes up about 1% of the dry weight of a mushroom.&nbsp; 1g of mushrooms contains 10 mg of psilocybin. This means you would need to ingest 87.5g of mushrooms for it to start to be dangerous!!!! I would be really hard to eat 87.5g of them from the sheer volume. That might be like a small trash bag full of shrooms.

				If you start having a bad trip, just relax and breathe.&nbsp; &nbsp;Each breath is a step to ending the trip.
