				This is my first time so bare with me!<br /><br />So to start off I took about 200mg of mdma in the pill form from a highly trusted vendor on here, over about 4/5 hours. Was amazing.<br /><br />Then despite all my prior research, went to an all night rave and was constantly trying to get back that amazing euphoria! Stupid huh?!<br /><br />So bought 100mg of &#039;mdma&#039; off a chap at £10 a bomb! (This better be real!) Two of us rolled earlier so felt nothing (thinking retrospectively this was always going to be the case) the other two had a great peak but it didn&#039;t last long, maybe 2 hours max. They were certain it was mdma though so, well lets say that was mdma at worst (best?) case of the full 100 mg.<br /><br />So because I didn&#039;t feel anything at the time I thought it was rubbish and sought some more from someone else. Bought 0.5g in a very small bag about the size of a 20p for £20. Seems cheap? May even (hopefully) be less than 500mg.<br /><br />Ended up going through 3/4 of the bag, mostly by myself but gave some out too. Worse case = 300mg.<br /><br />This stuff had me buzzing in the club and on the train back I couldn&#039;t keep still! Had music in and had to keep moving the whole time constantly! Bobbing non stop and bouncing my hand to the beat. I had a great time.<br /><br />My issue: Two days later and I am still bloody moving my limbs to an imaginary beat! I can stop myself but as soon as I take my mind off it I start doing it again. And my body feels like it wants me to? If i&#039;m not tapping my foot or something I&#039;m moving my body back and forward! (Great I&#039;m going mental!)<br /><br />So upon research looking at the small amount I have left. <br /><br />Looks: Very clear transparent small crystals. Looks uniform, no obvious sign of there being more than one drug present.<br />Smells: Strong smell of coconut/vanilla. Either way it smells very sweet.<br />Taste: From what I remember, quite bitter but bearable<br />Thoughts: Probably Methylone, but going to order a test kit.<br /><br />To racap, probably took 300mg mdma + 300mg methylone over 12 hours. Man that&#039;s dumb. If nothing else I&#039;ve learnt two valuable lessons! Both of which I should (and probably did!) have known before!<br /><br />1. Don&#039;t try and get that MDMA feeling back once it&#039;s gone!<br />2. Get trusted stuff from good vendors and don&#039;t get in a situation where you&#039;re buying sh*t from random people on nightclubs.<br /><br />I know I&#039;ve done bad, you can tell me too but try not to feed any anxiety I have please!<br /><br />So my question is have you ever heard of someone who has to still move limbs to imaginary beats two days after!? I can&#039;t find much on the net!<br /><br />Also, for neurotoxicity reasons, is doing mdma followed by bk-mdma worse than just doing 600mg of mdma (obviously this is still stupid). -bk-mdma floods the transmitters with dopamine moreso that mdma does, dopamine gets broken down into neurotoxic radicals etc? Hmmm...<br /><br />Anyway, never again!

				I take vitamin c and d before pumping up my dopamine flow for that reason. And dude you&#039;re describing still being under the effects of the drugs you took, bobbing to some beats doesn&#039;t sound bad, I would go with it. It will wear off soon enough.
