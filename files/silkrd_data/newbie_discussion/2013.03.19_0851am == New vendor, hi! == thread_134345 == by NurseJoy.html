				Hi, Nurse Joy here. I work at a pharmacy and have decided to funnel some alprazolam towards silk road!<br /><br />I am currently selling them at <br />$1.16 / 1mg pill.<br />$11.11 / 1mg x 10 pack<br />$28.60 / 1mg x 25 pack<br />$57.17 / 1mg x 50 pack<br /><br />This seems to be the cheapest deal for single pills on the market.<br /><br /><br />Is there much demand for this?<br /><br />Very open to discussion, thanks &lt;3<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2a26e5bbb7

				Had a look at your page, I&#039;m not too sure on price points and what not so can&#039;t comment on that. I would recommended putting in your description if you require FE or not. If you&#039;re happy to stay in Escrow this may help you get some new customers who dont yet have many transactions, to start getting some feedback.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to see new sellers who have PGP though.<br />best of luck with selling on the road :)

				Okay, thanks! I will do that. After I read the Seller&#039;s Guide I had assumed that people would generally know that I can&#039;t ask for FE, nor would I at such an early time.<br /><br />But you&#039;re right, I&#039;ll add that little point.<br /><br />:)

				I think you will fit in quite nicely here on the Road! An idea to help you with building a good rep and strong ties with the community: offer a limited supply of free samples (your call on which end pays the shipping) to allow people to verify quality/legitimacy. It would be in your best interests to require a verbal contract/agreement for the person receiving said sample to write a properly detailed and unbiased report after tasting/testing, along with 5/5 feedback with a summary and (just to make it nicer) a url for the review in the forums.<br /><br />In the event you decide to utilize this advice, I would be more than happy to be one of the first to sample in an effort to help establish you with the community and to also help push me towards being a known reviewer for the community. I would love to be able to help my fellow traveler on the Road be able to weed out good from bad and make informed decisions when choosing a reputable/quality source for any and all needs.

I will hand them out (minus the ones I sample) to some of my close and trusted associates to test with me whie we all vibe together for a while. Just send me a PM with the url for the two different listings (you should make them Stealth Listings so nobody sees it and thinks they can bust ovaries until you cave for them to get the same, just an idea. If you want to do this but are unsure of how, refer to the Seller&#039;s Guide). I will gladly help you out. I will be posting 2 separate Review Threads for my vendor reviews of all types (one for the Noobs and one for the rest of the community), and would appreciate your feedback of my reviews upon posting in both threads, along with my review on your own thread. I would advise creating one ASAP here in the Noob section, and spamming in one of the designated Spam Threads to reach a post count of 50+ to access the rest of the forum, and make another vendor thread there as well. Leave me url&#039;s for the thread(s) you create, and the review will go here, in your thread(s), and in mine as well. (:<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />Doctor<br /><br />P.S. I love the name you chose to use here. I am a long time Nintendo fan, and Pokemon fan of course. (: The only way it could be better is if you had gotten more nerdcore and went with some LoZ or FF or something. xD But, given the nature of what your line of work is (both legal and otherwise), I think you chose the most suitable of names possible! Quite the witty imagination.

I thought that would come up eventually...practically anything. However I&#039;m not stupid about it so I&#039;m not gonna have a ton of different drugs suddenly disappear from stock. The way I get it past stocktake is very cunning, I suppose I could do it with a couple more products.<br /><br />That being said I believe xanax/alprazolam/tranax has a lot of beneficial properties that can mostly outweigh its side effects (for most people). I believe it takes away the rights of the people that you can&#039;t go to a doctor, claiming anxiety or something similar, and be prescribed the medicine that will most likely help just due to something as silly as &quot;people get addicted easily&quot; - if people get addicted to something that makes them feel good, they aren&#039;t hurting anyone else and probably benefiting their own lives in a lot of positive ways.<br /><br />It&#039;s from this moral standpoint I also am eventually going to move into Diazapam (valium) on silk road. Assuming I am treated well with my current product :) I&#039;ve knocked the price down by 2 thirds in the past couple of days just trying to get more sales. Seems like theres some big players hogging all the fun :P<br /><br />Sorry for the rant.<br /><br />&lt;3<br />NurseJoy!
