				Go on SR and go to the Cannabis subgroup. NorthWestDirect&#039;s ounce of medical marijuana for $225 is the top selling item. Their page is very legit and full of info, with many good reviews, some as recent as 13 hours ago. They even have two forum pages associated with their account (unfortunately I don&#039;t have the 50 necessary to post there!). So... WHY ARE THEY IGNORING ME???<br /><br />Nearly five full days ago (Saturday evening) I placed an order for their ounce. It still says &quot;processing&quot; on my account!! Their page even claims that they ship items within 24-72 hours excluding Sunday. Well excluding 24 hours for this past Sunday, 72 hours came and went yesterday. Without it being shipped. I messaged them about this yesterday, and they have not yet even read it, let alone replied. (Previously, about a different inquiry, they got back to me the same day.) I&#039;m feeling quite disconcerted here, and would really like to know what&#039;s going on. I would not have expected this from a top seller!!!<br /><br />Does anybody know what&#039;s up with NorthWestDirect?? Has anyone else had similar issues with them? Should I keep waiting, or just cancel the order and buy from someone else? This is quite frustrating and any help or advice is much appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Hey there. I have not directly dealt with them but I had a similar issue with another reputable vendor. I had placed an order on Sat. and 4 days later still processing and no answer to 2 messages sent to this vendor. In my case after 4 days and no communication, lo and behold the vendor posts a new policy regarding newbies and limitations. This was due to the road being down from the DOS attacks and a backlog of 60 plus orders. Making a long story short I cancelled my order and found another reputable vendor with good reviews for good medical herb and placed an order no problem which has already shipped as of today. If they are ignoring you cancel your order and find another one. I believe the general consensus is that after 5 days and no answer to your repeated inquiries cancelling your order would be warranted. Just my humble opinion. Best of luck.

				Thanks very much for your opinion! Yeah, I agree that five days seems like a reasonable amount of time. I think I&#039;ll cancel it tonight if I still haven&#039;t heard back... Just wondering, would you care to share your reputable herb vendor? Always looking for good deals&nbsp; ;D

				Cancel your order asap. NorthWestDirect hasn&#039;t sent me, and also many other customers, orders that have been placed as long as 3 weeks ago. Get out while you can. He&#039;s trying to get as many people to FE for him as possible before he just pulls the plug and takes off. Me and other customers have been discussing this issue for a while now, I for example ordered a half pound 3 weeks ago and still haven&#039;t recieved it =[ No reason to let this douche bag tie up your BTC and waste your time like he did mine and many others...I use what I buy to flip and pay my bills and this piece of shit has just completely fucked me over. I don&#039;t understand how people do this to each other...but oh well...Fuck em. Get out while you can!!!
