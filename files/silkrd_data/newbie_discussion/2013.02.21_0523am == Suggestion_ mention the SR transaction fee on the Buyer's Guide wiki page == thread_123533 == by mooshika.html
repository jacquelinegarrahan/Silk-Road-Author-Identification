				To whom it may concern,<br /><br />Elsewhere in the forums, I&#039;ve read that SR charges a 6.23% fee to the buyer for every transactionâ€”at least, every transaction that goes through escrow. OK, fine. I don&#039;t blame SR for seeking a financial reward for their labor in hosting a marketplace. However, I&#039;m a little disappointed that the fee is not mentioned anywhere on the &quot;Buyer&#039;s Guide&quot; page of the SR wiki, where it would be very useful information for us newbies. Knowing in advance about the fee would help prevent many frustrations and annoyances, I should think.<br /><br />Also, since current policy segregates us newbies from other forum members, I would greatly appreciate it if someone (Scout, maybe?) forwarded my suggestion to other forum subcategories. Thank you.

				The fee is taken out from the amount paid ... what I mean is, if you buy something for 5 btc, you still only pay that 5 btc -- it&#039;s the vendor who sees the fee taken out.

				And, since the fee only affects the vendor, it is only discussed in the vendor guide, rather than the buyer&#039;s guide.

				Hope I was able to shed some light on it for you!&nbsp; The fees only ever affect the vendors, so that&#039;s why they didn&#039;t address it in the buyer&#039;s guide.&nbsp; :)
