				this is my situation: i can&#039;t use cocaine (especially combined with alcohol) because everytime I do that the morning after when i woke up I have some seizures (convulsions,epilepsy-like): i tried cocaine 4 times IN TOTAL and happened all the times. So i will not try cocaine anymore.<br /><br />As for other substances: i took xtc pills 4-5 times and the day after i had seizures half of the times(2,3 times).<br /><br />Anyway normally i don&#039;t have seizures but if i don&#039;t sleep enough, sometimes COULD happen that i have seizures: this happens generally 1 time every 10-12 months (even without using any drug), so is quite rare anyway.&nbsp; BUT with drugs like cocaine i have seizures ALL THE TIMES.<br />************************<br />So my questions is: trying heroin (low dose: 0.1gr), snorted, could give me seizures ?<br />or not ?<br />***********************

				If even lack of sleep can give you seizures then you&#039;d probably be better off talking to a neurologist than an anonymous message board.<br /><br />That said, there are a number of readily available drugs that have been used to combat seizures.&nbsp; The most obvious (and the least nasty) are the benzos - particularly Klonopin.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some readily available (on SR) antipsychotics are also used to treat certain kinds of seizure disorders.&nbsp; Some have also had luck with marijuana, of course, but care should be taken when selecting particular strains.<br /><br />Stimulants (i.e. cocaine) are more likely to cause seizures but it&#039;s not outside the realm that introducing a shock to the system like the first few lines of H might also set you off.&nbsp; Honestly I&#039;d be leery of almost any chemical until a competent neuro has done a workup on you.

				@malk: Not destined to &quot;not take drugs&quot; but to not take some kinds of drugs.<br />Nothing ever happened with Marijuana and Mushrooms and i took them many many times: so i guess the problem is not &quot;drugs&quot; (that means everything and nothing) but WHAT KIND of drugs.<br />As for Heroin: it has a very &quot;interesting&quot; stigma and I can understand it but what i don&#039;t understand is that I&#039;m just saying that I want to try it for understanding what it really is, and not just take second hand information.<br /><br />@n0nc3s: the fact that lack of sleep could give me seizures (epilepsy-like fits) doesn&#039;t mean that everytime that I have lack of sleep i get seizures: I have this kind of fits something like 1 TIME PER YEAR and I have lack of sleep at least 150 times per year, so is kinda of rare, very occasional that i have a fit. And i have these kind of fits generally the first minutes that I wake up, when I&#039;m in the bed.<br />Do you think i never been to a neurologist ? I have been OF COURSE. He gave me Valproic acid: but is kind of stupid to take this medication for something that happens ONCE per year (are much more the side effects, that the benefits), so I stopped it.<br />my question was just: SEEN MY SITUATION (and what happen to me with xtc and cocaine) COULD HEROIN GIVE SEIZURES (convulsions) AS&nbsp; WELL ?<br /><br />p.s. Heroin is really not what i look for in drugs: i&#039;m the type of person that like ganja, mushrooms and LSD :-P&nbsp; ;) ;)

Heroin might not be your type of drug right now, it doesnt take much before it could be the only drug you look for. In my opinion if you have never done it dont start now. Opiates are the devil. Stick to the pyschs.

				i just wanted to add to the mention of benzos-be very careful taking them. if you take them for a while and stop suddenly-or even run low in your body, they are notorious for CAUSING seizures. i used to have a wicked xanax habit150-300 a week-and when i just ran low -had grand mal seizures.

				I strongly recommend you to put your question to DoctorX in his thread on harm prevention and providing the answers to peoples questions such as your own. He is a genuine doctor (as he&#039;s only here to help, he provides a link to his IRL webpage), he&#039;s Spanish, though fully fluent in English, specializing in issues relating to drug users. He seems to be generally approving towards recreational drug use and really is a credit to SR. No, I don&#039;t have shares in his company, lol, but I&#039;m really impressed with his approach on here!

				I could preach all day about the shittiness of opiates - I&#039;m a recovering opiate addict and unfortunately, I will always struggle with this fact. Started with hydros as an &quot;adventurous, try-anything&quot; 17yr old girl and it, slowly but surely, spun out of control. I&#039;m 24 now and just weaned myself off methadone (was a slave to the window for a year) -- I&#039;m damn proud of the fact that I&#039;m finally clean of all opiates, especially considering methadone withdrawals are the fucking worst. Ever. So - I&#039;ll quit it with the sob story, but you sound like I used to... &quot;I just want to try it for myself! I want to try everything!&quot; ... just understand this: If you start fucking with opiates, they WILL fuck you right back.<br /><br />As for the chance of seizures, I wouldn&#039;t risk it. I know of a few people with epilepsy who had episodes while using heroin, oxy, etc. I&#039;ve only been there to actually witness the seizures twice and they definitely didn&#039;t look like a good time. My advice? Stick to weed and psychedelics. However, it doesn&#039;t look like you want to actually heed any of the advice in this thread. ;) Good luck, man.

				right ...i don&#039;t need advices :)<br />and i&#039;m not 17 :)<br />And i don&#039;t have epilepsy....or at least the neurologist told me so.<br />To have convulsions from time to time(like once per year) and be affected from epilepsy are 2 very different things.<br />Anyway I asked to that DoctorX advised by bobhope333 and, if anyone is interested, this is his answer:<br />-----<br />Most stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine and amph derivatives) and alcohol lower the seizure threshold in people prone to seizures. Benzos and some strains of cannabis (rich in CBD) are the safest drugs in this sense. Some opioids (fentanyl, meperidine, pentazocine, propoxyphene...) are more risky but seizures are not a typical problem of morphine and heroin. They are possible, but not very common.<br />By the way...if have not tried intranasal heroin and you don´t have tolerance, please consider that &quot;0.1 grams&quot; is a very high dosage. You should start by 5-10 mg.<br />---

I have also read a lot about heroin addiction, and seizures have never been mentioned. <br />Benzo&#039;s and alcohol are the drugs associated with seizures through withdrawal- that is what makes detox from these class of drugs dangerous and life-threatening. Detox from heroin, however, is never life-threatening- just damned unpleasant. That&#039;s why, if you are sent down, you are thrown a couple of paracetamol and told to do your rattle! Actually, nowadays, due to the Court of Human Rights getting involved, prisons now have to issue methadone, I believe, but that is nothing to do with saving lives (well... unless it stops somebody from hanging themselves because they can&#039;t do their rattle).

				You say the seizures occur when you first wake up? Im interested in this. Do you mind describing your seizure, if possible?<br /><br />If you buy a .1 of H then I would dump it all out make sure you chop it up good if its rocked or pebbles. (You really should get a mg scale but if you don&#039;t have one) Then try and make 10 equal piles and then take each pile and split that in half. That is what you should start with. Wait 20-30 min to get an idea of the effects before attempting to go at it again. Please be safe!<br />Again you really need a scale.

Never happened that I had seizures when I already got up or in any case never happened when i was awake for more than 10 minutes....

				Will heroin cause seizures in me and most other people here? No.<br />Will it cause YOU seizures? Pretty much guaranteed.<br /><br />But you don&#039;t care, right? You just want some kind of approval to do it - so just do it then.<br /><br />Then you&#039;ll have heroin AND seizures!! No downside there, right?<br /><br />Consider this - maybe getting a seizure will be minor compared to when you may eventually have a stroke from purposefully inducing seizures- then you&#039;ll have a loss of speech, be partially paralyzed and have trouble walking. But trying heroin is worth it, right?&nbsp; Enjoy your heroin, and good luck!!<br /><br />

				Let me please just say one thing: if you have never tried H, keep it that way. Please be very warned about this sneaky pest of a drug. It should be strictly kept to the treatment of terminally sick people.

				Maybe u&nbsp; should start wit klonopin or Lyrica, lyrica can however cause seizures if u take too much before building a tolerance. But once u created ur deference it&#039;s a quite good medicine against seizure. <br />But don&#039;t expect to quit it easily. The withdrawals have been compared with both opiates and benzo. Not a very nnice substance when it comes to those things.. Would personally prefer gabapentin, but not sure how effective that is against convulsions and seizures. (?)

				I told you...generally I have seizures like one time every 12 months if not taking anything like cocain or XTC (that i guess most of the time is mixed with shitty amphetamine).<br />So as i have seizures one time every 12 months i&#039;m not gonna take Lyrica or any other benzo EVERY DAY .....<br /><br />i wanted just to know if heroin, in my case, could give seizures.<br />but i guess that i already got my answer :)<br /><br />thanks everyone...
