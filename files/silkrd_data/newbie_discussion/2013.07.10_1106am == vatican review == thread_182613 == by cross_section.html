				hey, i was really satisfied with my purchase from vendor vatican and would like to write a review, however since i don&#039;t use forum that much i can only post in the newbie section, so i&#039;m just gonna paste it here ;)<br />so this was my first purchase from vendor named vatican, and i can definitely say that it was flawless. communication and response time was great. vatican is really friendly and understanding, and has earned my trust really fast. i have received my package 3 days after placing my order (which was waaay faster than i expected). also, i should note that it was disguised very cleverly.<br /><br />about the product itself - i&#039;ve tried vatican&#039;s dmt a couple of weeks ago, and would like to share my experience with others. <br />i took approximately 35mg of dmt and started to vape it using tin foil and bottle (yeah, i know foil is inefficient, but i didn&#039;t have meth pipe at that time yet). so at first, when i inhaled it was extremely hard to keep smoke in my lungs, cause it is really disgusting (tastes like burning rubber or smth) and hot. however, after like 15 seconds the effects started to kick in, and i actually forgot that i was holding smoke in my lungs. it was not my first experience with psychedelics, but what happened next really blew my mind. i forgot that i needed to breath, i forgot how to speak, my heart forgot how to pump blood, even muscle forgot how to function. i was like completely seperated from my body, i felt my soul to slip out of it, and blent in with the room and the whole universe into one. everything was extremely confusing, and i could not realize who i was, where i was and what time i was in. everything was moving at the speed of light. my friend went to another room to swich the song, and he was moving in a way the agents in the movie &#039;the matrix&#039; move. it seemed that he came back before he even left, due to that. then he started talking to me or smth, but his lips were moving 10x faster than possible, and i didn&#039;t understand anything. then i tried to tell him, that i&#039;m ok, and got really confused, because i was trying to find myself speaking in the room, and as i saw my friend talking to me, i thought that I WAS HIM, and that we somehow switched bodies or smth. i actually though that the whole room was full of people, all of who were ME.<br />then it seemed that my skin and the whole body melted. the bedsheets seemed like a part of me, and when i touched them they were like the softest, warmest, smoothest thing i have ever felt. i was just twisting and rolling on the bed for some time. then i got up and my soul left my body again. and this time i got a little bit scared, as i thought that i&#039;ve died. it seemed that i was in an ancient egypt or something. and when my soul returned to the body, i&#039;ve looked to the mirror, and i&#039;ve noticed that i have 8 freaking arms. i started moving them, and they multiplied even more times. also i should add that all these things happend in such a short period of time, it was impossible for me to actually perceive most of the information. also, as this was happening the colours and shapes were drastically distorted.<br />then the effects started to wear off a little bit and i&#039;ve realized that i&#039;m under the influence of dmt and started messing with my voice and so on. also, for one moment it seemed that i was weightless and could fly, and that the fan was actually blowing me away like a feather, so i guess it would be good idea to have anyone around who&#039;s sober, if you&#039;re gonna try dmt yourselves. that&#039;s about it, after that, the most vivid visuals were gone, and i was just feeling weird and overwhelmed with emotions.<br /><br />so yeah, considering that i have been able to experience such a powerful trip using a relatively small dose of dmt and a self made smoking device, i could say that vatican really has an amazing product for extremely low price! i honestly recommend this vendor for anyone who wants to try dmt :)<br />

				I&#039;ve actually wanted to properly try DMT. Got some at a festival from a friend, called it The God Molecule, but was so fucked by that point it was just throwing it down a well.<br /><br />Talk to me about usage and dosage.<br /><br />Quite experienced with a lot of stuff - e, mdma, lsd, shrooms, speed, etc. - but DMT hasn&#039;t been much on my radar. Thanks.

				I am in a little pause atm from DMT (used it extensively in this year and had to make a pause to integrate all the experiences) but when I will return the first thing I want to do is to try your DMT, Vatican.<br /><br />You are one of the few EU vendors I haven&#039;t tried yet and I definitely want to fill this shortcoming.<br /><br />From the look of it (from the little I can gather from the pictures) your DMT seems very pure (on par of the best I&#039;ve tried) with a good price to booth. I suppose we will hear when I will return ;)
