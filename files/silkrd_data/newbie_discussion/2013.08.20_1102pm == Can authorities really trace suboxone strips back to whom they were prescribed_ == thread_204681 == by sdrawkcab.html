				I&#039;ve heard from different people on the SR forums that if the authorities get a-hold of suboxone strips that are still in their original foil wrappers, that they could use the barcodes/lot numbers/product numbers/any other information to trace the suboxone back to the person it was prescribed to..<br /><br />Does anyone KNOW if this is true or false?<br /><br />Also, do the suboxone strips foil wrappers set off metal detectors or get picked up by x-rays?

				Also, dogs and drug sniffing machines can&#039;t sniff out suboxone can they? (buprenorphine/naloxone)

				I was on Subs for years, I was on them when the strips came out , I went from the orange pill to the strips. The clinic I went to told us they could be traced, I don&#039;t see why not, each package is individually marked and numbered. Tell ya what too about Subs, I&#039;d rather withdraw off heroin and OC&#039;s combined than have to withdraw from Subs again. They were fucking hell to get off of.

				&nbsp; Subutex/soboxone is fucking weird from a legal standpoint.&nbsp; I know a doctor and he can prescribe dilaudid and fentanyl no problem just from being a practicing doctor.&nbsp; But suboxone and subutex require that he takes a class first to be able to prescribe them.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; More concerning your question, I know the packets you are talking about and I can&#039;t say 100 percent but I am almost certain they can track them due to the barcode.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Since I started taking the one with naloxone occasionally when in pain (I think its subutex, don&#039;t remember.)&nbsp; I don&#039;t even look forward to taking it at all.&nbsp; Whenever I take it the decision is purely one of getting rid of the pain, my body does not want it.&nbsp; You&#039;d think they&#039;d be less strict on something like that, but then again if it made sense it wouldn&#039;t be the government.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Honestly, though the only thing that you can get from asking this is knowing for sure that its true, you wont know if its false for sure.&nbsp; Even if someone says they can&#039;t trace for sure, how can they know that?&nbsp; The only people who would be able to say for sure are people who have been busted because its been traced.&nbsp; This question has no chance of making you less paranoid.

				I completely agree with the withdrawals from buprenorphine. I have withdrawn from 160mg&#039;s of methadone, 40mg&#039;s of methadone, heroin, oxy80&#039;s, and buprenorphine, all cold turkey... methadone at 160 was definitely the worst but i would rather withdrawal off the 40mg&#039;s of methadone or heroin again than withdrawal off buprenorphine. all that bullshit the doctors tell people about how it&#039;s not as bad as other withdrawals.. ha. <br /><br /><br />and thank you for answering my question. I&#039;m inclined to believe it just due to the unique serial numbers etc. and that you heard it from an actual doctor..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />but if the strips are out of the package, can a dog or drug sniffing machine smell either the buprenorphine or the naloxone in the suboxone?<br /><br /><br />edit: I have not and will not send suboxone strips in their wrappers due to the most likely guarantee of legal action against me if the package is somehow intercepted. I just don&#039;t know how I could fight that one.<br />

				&nbsp;The barcode and the two dimensional code can be traced to the purchaser of the meds from the pharmacy.

				This is just a guess here, but I&#039;d think dogs wouldn&#039;t be a problem. Those dogs gotta be trained to smell the different drugs they sniff for and I don&#039;t believe the authorities are that concerned about sub smuggling to train dogs for it.

				So when people usually sell/buy suboxone strips on SR, do they usually get rid of the suboxone strip wrapper before shipping it?

				To a point yes they can be traced. Pharmacies don&#039;t record what numbers go to each patient but if your local police find a bunch of wrappers they can call the DEA and request a trace to find out what distributor and pharmacy its from. <br />It&#039;s kinda like a lot number on steroids.

				Hi Yes they can trace it by the serial number. This is 100% fact. They can do it too to Fentanyl patches as well. I wouldn&#039;t ship with the foil. Also dogs can not smell suboxone. I know that because my buddy works as aprison guard and it is a big concern there because it can be smuggled in easily in letter.

Some cut the codes off and ship like half the foil.<br /><br />I had a Dr tell me that the police in one area have a program where they are able to scan them and see if they are yours right there. So, yea don&#039;t be riding around with any that aren&#039;t yours.
