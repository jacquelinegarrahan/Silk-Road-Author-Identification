				I&#039;ve graduated from the Newbie Discussion and now have a thread over in Product Offers (please use this thread instead):<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=213977.0<br /><br />-----<br /><br />NOTE: I DO NOT ASK FOR FE!<br /><br />Well, here I sit with piles and piles of magic mushrooms. I need people to ship them to! Maybe you? Yes! You!<br /><br />I&#039;m SuperStealthSam and I&#039;m here to provide you with large quantities of high quality organic magic mushrooms that I personally grow and ship directly to you!<br /><br />I am a brand new seller so I&#039;m offering a GIANT 50% OFF DISCOUNT to the first 10 customers who order! Be one of the lucky few and place your order before I take this listing down!!!<br /><br />I will never ask you to finalize early and I&#039;m highly motivated to generate perfect positive feedback from ALL of my orders!<br /><br />Click here for my silkroad listing!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ff18ce85ab<br /><br />**** OVERSTUFFING OFFER ONLY FOR 1st 10 ORDERS!!!! ****<br /><br />In addition to the GIANT 50% off discount I will be overstuffing the first 10 orders by a GIANT MARGIN. <br /><br />Just how GIANT? <br /><br />Let&#039;s just say you&#039;ll be BLOWN AWAY when you open your package and weigh it out!!!<br /><br /><br />**** About The Mushrooms You&#039;re Ordering ****<br /><br />* These shrooms are dried cracker dry and shipped to you in stealthified airtight mylar packaging.<br /><br />* These mushrooms are all grown indoors by me by hand. I ensure every stage of development is ideally suited to maximizing the shroom&#039;s potency and quality.<br /><br />* I am the only person who is aware of their existence. <br /><br />* I DO NOT use vermiculite at any point in the grow. Vermiculite is a common substrate ingredient but it&#039;s actually a mild carcinogen. If you see gold flakes on shrooms from other vendors you&#039;ve got cancer-causing vermiculite. It&#039;s difficult to remove from shrooms and in my opinion has no place in mycology.<br /><br />* The shrooms you&#039;re ordering are a highly potent substrain of the &quot;B+&quot; strain of psilocybe cubensis organic magic mushrooms. They&#039;ll KNOCK YOU ON YOUR ASS!!!<br /><br />* Some mushrooms may appear purple or blue in places. This is normal in cubensis and simply indicates the presence of hallucinogenic psilocybin in the mushroom tissue.<br /><br />* Some mushrooms may appear black in places. This is due to spores that were dropped by other mushrooms in the grow. The spores do not affect anything in the mushroom other than appearance.<br /><br /><br />**** Shipping Info ****<br /><br />* I ship to you via priority mail and send you a delivery confirmation number. This service is FREE OF CHARGE to you.<br /><br />* All packages are internally sealed in INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH MYLAR. I do NOT use vacuum sealing because it does absolutely nothing to prevent smells. Only aluminized mylar is protective enough to block any smells coming from the package, the non aluminized plastic in vacuum bags visually looks impressive but is not secure. I ship according to this thread &quot;STEALTH THAT WORKS - DITCH THE PE FOOD GRADE VAC SEAL&quot; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0<br /><br />* You MUST provide a valid name and address or else the post office will simply not deliver your package. I have no control over packages that are lost due to the use of fake shipping information.<br /><br />* I WILL destroy the name and address information you provide once your order payment is finalized.<br /><br />* In order to minimize the time the packages are sitting in the post office I only ship on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. This ensures the package is not waiting around in a post office somewhere over the weekend, possibly getting inspected.<br /><br /><br />**** Feedback ****<br /><br />I work hard to give you EXACTLY what you want! Therefore I ask that you please leave ONLY 5/5 feedback. <br /><br />Because 4/5 feedback is considered negative feedback, if you want to leave anything other than 5/5 then please contact me via the Silkroad message system so I can resolve the issue. I want to provide full satisfaction to you!<br /><br />Since feedback is so important, I will not be able to do any further business with buyers who leave less than 5/5 feedback. <br /><br /><br />**** Refunds ****<br /><br />Please DO NOT use fake information in your shipping address! Lost orders will be given a 50% refund and I will not be able to do further business with you. <br /><br />Keep things accurate so you can get your product and I can continue to help you get what you want!<br /><br /><br />**** Are you a bulk reseller? ****<br /><br />If so, I can help you make a lot of money! Here&#039;s now:<br /><br />Place an order for one of my public listings. These are smaller size orders used to locate trustworthy buyers.<br /><br />If all goes well and we are both satisfied with the order you receive and the timeliness of your payment, I will send you a link to a private listing in which you can order much larger quantities at a steep discount.<br /><br />These orders will be for a pound or more of dry shrooms at a time.<br /><br />If this arrangement sounds attractive to you, place your first order now because once I have a handful of trustworthy bulk clients I will no longer be listing publicly.<br /><br />My goal is to find a small number of high volume, high discount clients that I can give full attention to rather than handling a large number of smaller orders with smaller discounts.<br /><br />With my bulk pricing you should be able to make a 50% to 100% return on your money depending on your local market conditions for magic mushrooms.<br /><br /><br />**** Time To Act! ****<br /><br />All ready? Place your order right now and get your first package of high quality organic magic mushrooms right away!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ff18ce85ab<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.2 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQINBFI9QjMBEADu2JikwfMCTdB67U5jhQFVofftzE/xmmA0bbHXHsdmCLLzN46x<br />NBTs1rYNQFQjbqaLTPYayAzvUSQk79TR8XQSlrVhYvvwd2GdB12wxodEbfXe7SBR<br />CCe4KbvyWNfjpIZ02jd2VVWAsVEz31EwPi2KEozRQ0GfBpd2o910nPi5sgpnYiar<br />XBVC8FLUHdH7pGNRuToT2fHXjm6Lfv5dcpniRjraDlTwzM3ZlDUcbH7q15+UMYAm<br />ud+cox2FAH343+4FqF18wX/3zT0Ykc2vltLV8ytiVpD16KPWDQYK+/9aW1N4E3Os<br />jLmRJIUvOCxDqbpOT1K7HWj3vLYeeOKEbvOSBVDPfYAGrCMXQtHEcq5ZdNtgQ5PP<br />eOuU45WthZtEIB2zcilfJTtD6VA2ZEdF1c0cyDrM7KLAMvS6UoxPU4cyWpSPiauY<br />Z5ErWwInDXF6F7+vB5hr57nps6LvH5P6W8zA9JCVUaDIHl2XF5LJhbOvTjE4E20m<br />hJAXWWMqzGh8FNoTqP/lHEc9bV1fvDrhJRUg7CtglpTXgv79P3vtBkhtfgdUUuRq<br />fsHxhf/IO5+xriiXnEJoeZiL26+/w5hBplWTzo4FwO82FrF5JZR3vTCV/khC4Zkr<br />HdiURSlcICNwowZuWIYxY4+nSFrZzQnoi5idkCvFiwztOF2roWriWC4IxwARAQAB<br />tJNTdXBlclN0ZWFsdGhTYW0gKFNpbGtyb2FkIFByb2ZpbGU6IGh0dHA6Ly9zaWxr<br />cm9hZHZiNXBpejNyLm9uaW9uL3NpbGtyb2FkL3VzZXIvZGQ2OGM4MWMwOSkgPHBs<br />ZWFzZS51c2Uuc2lsa3JvYWQubWVzc2FnZS5zeXN0ZW1AdXNlci5kZDY4YzgxYzA5<br />LmNvbT6JAjkEEwECACMFAlI9QjMCGwMHCwkIBwMCAQYVCAIJCgsEFgIDAQIeAQIX<br />gAAKCRDSrU93R0j9TLOwD/9/rH+R48xwQREN3cZSTnazuWXMtJ6UmFuVmBzACSAE<br />0ZEAQdZSJUDj/pH4UX+Ekt4Fg27VzagkCcYcW6VaYPTbqWc83AlYCcPimgOHthoL<br />XauB3UatBP7qHaLwytU2CFed3tFs2AXJf8tXFkbxSpcRWD7nKj5ZOlDZIBj3BIkc<br />iUo1EvE7KFvoRXNPy6uAYQcdyOX6X0JNIvW6j0bToQMSWlhBpCL+M3MyBGXQq9mg<br />gUMwApZZKknVFN9Nki2pRdpBE5ILZIgzrqq5PRiB7QJn5h0gB+lCXGyqOwhdwFQZ<br />uaz5JGGd161xz7EpBiRww8tjo0df8fquEOpUeAwHAOryrdqI8rgwS7EpO6txQZQg<br />EsKut7MFuqDaeTqyL7kWGrjavu9dkEaqtkCpchJQlVTw93cnFaSxiYyQh0ZNVJAi<br />zM77PVKPv8GFRNpiJoiwt374b/20S28NpAuvhtYdgT8kfmbFcC1T0iX7IbXhDsbd<br />gElIFfY5pwvpSrM91iqxSfNfMPGkY3Vf4jVOUFAqs0azGHtFMIXlfT7Dgb8xP6KY<br />3QgSls66toyrlxQmpL3pmDnKBU3yYKYZhjpsGRXCMGdwA+UIpcX+jfNoUocTh1yF<br />2qdcLqY28FQBkX2RGL0CZl9R14ZOSsEJdQTC2Bg70+PaIvUGU76qPHpsxr4aCWh9<br />G7kCDQRSPUIzARAA08a1PrBMJq/BJ9lrcAH/z13UEiDdwgqucH8us0GGXk2tLYYy<br />bNrEE0/bqGMg/hyjRvreD8logqapZl6qk8VguCB5AOlcSA2PiksdYpTZKoCW7udp<br />bCeysk+KjSKVas8gKyJMV3AF5BVPqT7LCZFT8AxEeETksOl3PknjhQm+JCrWXnD9<br />8kw0aoZssUTt7FVScDzxE3fepLg5zKTrwDsSBA+lbf0t25Mv0rLVozg+WAYLo2AJ<br />BEZlZmumxGcyH1WJT+b+yUq9Cyh/7p9Ah93LrUSL5ufSHZOZHVkNRY6Azy+aYM7x<br />RJskE4rzFoMxnFVPFI/5X/eQk/4a9nw/NJpgPoutux0aujJEWcuC9gfKa22J6DvW<br />4CJM+XNTVGjN23pfFwtdMTyAqfSudDWoVCvWu8WrxgOgpvcvPG0GIBAx/skn5iMI<br />kVoEYC5Eb55ZJiiC8Ueeo6/MhBQ3LgpeRQ8K5jsYX/JDd1LxXXTE3pQQEQgMlAR0<br />IXcs1Z0UmQPFEpTS3PcJI8H74RrkTe8S7NqSURNv03lonwchmpVr7azFbjnN2LBr<br />UEkjcKYegPCXK+llVNg8tbtR8sS/OVs2hpvuXXs8nrdhf2Z+xs4J4vUvMEYKoKBT<br />M1vFPqLpVGuLwNmh0iAGHjlAbeg3Lj3lmiR8alz7/1WvCCFchNi4YFR1yvkAEQEA<br />AYkCHwQYAQIACQUCUj1CMwIbDAAKCRDSrU93R0j9TEdeEACQ1uCph49k0QF6VPdB<br />BpysQB8AqLPW4LQGpO+H+mLFYfE/hpChLneXv5oCFVCQ8Onzi8CqypfvURHBCgKp<br />tSI8yFG8y8Hk8pANshuuTTH6WaFtTseHZDiv+H3TqvvRZ++dq1nG8kp/2POAD1fX<br />1EzyL7G3iCc3wXRzkYgtdUw7o0FeQdN3Np6sL+65gXQucqPc9DEf9/wo5lTDX4xa<br />wfFsDJL2wuX5NgW+V5y4CDEcZFw27AJczixOEflXvZfdV1lHI4xtDRZkkICQXsMY<br />9k4xBZ+zyMkKTdZA3+zteFx1hZRlActsqd3QiJt99i3BxT92o7lzQiuo9iAI1he3<br />BA+uRUKrdCdG4ztSnMKKvfuXQZAvGUOfoH42QjdANNSc6LEMaOnK0R0GQbV7LfSc<br />r6qCCznYdhzzv3W9E+FdcE1Ce+RbICmkwHKnjOOFO0aS62vv5G7eFTlIzFNrt80C<br />xX2/GspOiEYn2q/VT31jxGfvymt4CNY1d8J9x5g0hfDVtg/1JI82/i2vTH8w5skb<br />mQBK1uCWFT1ezS8j+5MYp1rYqlO9Ux1dYTZ5ITAFcFYz70IiCaAKa+UusrbFlNUW<br />LhG3qBU9ABKZa0rmHf5LGTZgnJH3z5tNYxyRpDoRnsbeAvac4AQ92vG5BGuL3HXJ<br />zWZ4EeaW54nZSDkSnJHNGq6p0w==<br />=OS6B<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />**** Let&#039;s Get Started!!! ****<br /><br />Ready to get started?

				Be weary people.&nbsp; There have been a lot of mushroom scams here lately.&nbsp; Never FE and if a deal sounds too good to be true it probably is.&nbsp; SSS could be legitimate, just trying to look after newbies.

				Thanks for your reply. As mentioned in the OP I do not ask for FE.<br /><br />As for it being &quot;too good to be true&quot;, that&#039;s a legitimate concern. However I have several pounds of mushrooms that I need to unload which is the reason for the temporary low pricing. My dehydrator is literally overflowing.<br /><br />I do not want to just give them away as free samples and would prefer to reward paying customers.

				It looks pretty good.&nbsp; I would shorten where you talk about becoming a bulk seller and just tell them to contact you for bigger orders or just add a listing for quarter pounds.&nbsp; Keep it short, sweet and to the point.&nbsp; You will do fine...
