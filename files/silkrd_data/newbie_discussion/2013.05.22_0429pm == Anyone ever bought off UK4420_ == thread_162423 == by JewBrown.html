				A close friend wants me to get hold of a gram of pineapple express and this is the only guy doing it in the UK. Was going to get the deadly nightshade but Austinawayway has removed the listing today&nbsp; :&#039;( <br /><br />He asks for FE :/ so I&#039;m hoping some of you could share your experiences buying off UK4420?<br /><br />cheers

				So far, it&#039;s been a really bad experience. <br /><br />I ordered two grams of hash, but the package only contained one gram. I messaged him about it and he said really sorry and he&#039;ll refund the difference. That was five days ago, and I&#039;ve heard nothing else despite several reminders from me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve put the order in resolution and I can only hope that he&#039;s busy with RL stuff and will get back to me eventually.<br /><br />But it&#039;s a poor show. I&#039;ve had much better experiences with the other well-known UK sellers and won&#039;t be bothering with this one again.<br /><br />HTH

I was going to order as well. I am really after some potent skunk some infamous strains like pineapple express, white widow from the UK and he&#039;s the only guy doing it at the moment.<br /><br />Think I&#039;ll wait. Hope your order gets sorted.<br />

				Well it took a few days but they sorted out a refund for the missing part of the order and all&#039;s well.<br /><br />As a show of good faith I&#039;m going to order from them again.<br /><br />

				Don&#039;t buy from this guy. I FE in good faith because i was a new customer and he told me i had too and i am still waiting (12 days now). Uk to UK should take no longer than 3 days max. It&#039;s in the terms and conditions as a vendor that you can&#039;t demand FE so that should have set alarm bells ringing anyway. In a PM where he said i have to FE he said &quot;I ain&#039;t gonna mess up reputation over 1 -12 grams of hash. The problem with silk road is you have to give feedback when you pay for item so you have to give positive feedback at that time in good faith. <br /><br />There are plenty of honest vendors with a lightening fast service on SR, UK4420 is not one of them.<br /><br />He has lost me as a customer anyways over 1g of hash. I wouldn&#039;t order from him if he was the only vendor on here. The guy is a prick, a bad businessman and a dirty little conman.
