				Hey fumachu, don&#039;t be like that. Getting angry won&#039;t solve anything and it&#039;s understandable that they want to control who gets in, in order to avoid spam.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a pain in the ass but as a sysadmin I know that changing the forum&#039;s source code in order to block only new registrations would probably not be easy and this measure works.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a few more posts :) keep on going, you&#039;re almost there! <br /><br />Thanks Jack, I don&#039;t post on the forums for a long time.

				Today I&#039;m happy. <br />Finally got the order that I made from generalm3ss. I ordered 1 2C-B capsule but he sent me 2 capsules, and it&#039;s the first time I order something from him.<br />It took 2 weeks and I was starting to get worried it don&#039;t usually take so long.<br /><br />I came here to thank him and tell that he doesn&#039;t need to worry because I got everything but unfortunately SR is down.

				Unfortunately I won&#039;t be using it anytime soon. I quit all the drugs, including cigarettes, after a major psychotic breakdown from prolonged psychedelic use.<br />I&#039;ve been clean for almost 5 months but I have an EDM festival in the next 2 months and I gotta use MDMA or 2C-B but I&#039;m too fucking scared to hallucinate in a public place.<br /><br />I&#039;ll maybe save the 2C-B to take with some friend.

				Meanwhile I&#039;ve converted to Stoicism, which isn&#039;t a philosophy against drugs per se but it is against becoming dependent on emotions and being able to control how we act through rationality, they claim that it&#039;s the path to happiness and tranquility, which was what I was looking for with drugs.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been spending my time reading the works of Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca.

				I&#039;m pretty sure that the attacker is doing nothing more than successive GET/POST to SR.<br /><br />He could check the HTTP headers of the attacker and use it to block it. <br />DPR probably has physical access to the SR servers, if he isn&#039;t logging, he would be smart to make a one-way cable to write the logs to another machine and allow no one else without local access to read them.<br /><br />If he&#039;s uber paranoid, he could stream cypher the fucker. <br /><br />daaamn I&#039;d love to have DPR job :D so fucking exciting.

				I wonder if DPR could provide sellers and even buyers with an API for remote management to allow faster access to the road, so that people could build their own clients.<br /><br />I thought about building a caching client to sell it to vendors wanting for better management of their store and faster access.<br />It could provide with features such as replying to 100 messages in a row and the application would automatically synchronize with silkroad.<br /><br />By the way, the SR captcha is easily crackable though statistical analysis.<br /><br />

				I know a little bit about how tor works and encryption in general. <br />I have have some knowledge about networks too and have developed a few programs using TCP sockets.<br /><br />The Silkroad works with the HTTP protocol and works the same way as any other website, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s above Tor.<br />If I send enough GET/POST requests to the Silkroad, I&#039;ll flood it and it can result in a denial of service if there isn&#039;t enough bandwidth, processing power or whatever on the Silkroad server side. It doesn&#039;t matter whether it&#039;s above Tor or not, one can perform DoS/DDoS attacks the same way he could perform with normal websites.

				But you still can&#039;t know the real IP of who&#039;s attacking... You&#039;ll just know, if so, the IP of his last hop, not even his enter node, i suppose? Dunno, I still haven&#039;t taken time to try to read technical stuff about Tor...
