I&#039;m happy to trade the slow servers for my privacy, freedom, and the great quality I receive, in my honest opinion it&#039;s well worth the wait.

				I have most definately noticed different times of being slower and being faster, being timed out or not. US west coast very busy time is from 5-9pm aproximately. I am able to get on to SR at any time during 24 hours multiple times and have noticed this. It may correspomd with time zone hours that people are working and then off work wherever you are in the world. As for the guy who started this post. Where the hell is your gratitude anyway? You do need to take something to mellow out your blood pressure and your mouth.

				Is it worth the wait?&nbsp; HELL YES.&nbsp; <br />Having said that, I have bought several new laptops and replaced several HDs due to throwing the computer at the wall while waiting for SR to load....

				I think it depends on the traffic, generally in the morning the loading times are next to non-existent, it&#039;s that fast however that changes when the clock hits 5 - 6 PM. Oh boy, it takes 50 seconds to load a page just for it to show &quot;unable to establish a connection to the page requested&quot;. Or have an error stating &quot;you just posted 0 seconds ago from your IP. Please try another time.&quot; when browsing the forums, when in actuality I didn&#039;t even post a thing. Really bugs me sometimes.
