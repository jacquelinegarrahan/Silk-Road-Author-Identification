				I&#039;m looking for good quality MDMA vendors from the European Union preferably because it&#039;s usually cheaper.<br />I&#039;ve heard CloudSurfer is very good, but I don&#039;t know when he&#039;s coming back.<br /><br />Please post some vendors with the BEST quality MDMA if you would, thank you.

				I&#039;ve tried Aakoven&#039;s a few months ago, and it was pretty good. A very clean high, quite mental and euphoric, but not as strong physically / touchy. I would give it a 8/10. I&#039;ve ordered from him again recently and I will post on the forums when I get to try his latest MDMA.F

				An update to my previous post. I received a order from Aakoven, and the quality was not as good as the first time. I would give it 6/10. I ordered 2g but only received 1g. Aakoven said he would ship the missing 1g, but I never received it. He did reply to my original messages regarding this problem, and seemed serious about sending the missing 1g, but at the end I never received it. I FE&#039;d because I trusted that he would send the missing 1g since I had successfully ordered from him previously. In retrospect I shouldn&#039;t have done so, since I never received it and I forfeited the possibility of resolving this problem through escrow.

				I have used both JesusofRave and Interways. I would say they are both great quality as both tested straight to black with a marquis test. I have not roll tested Jesus&#039;s MDMA yet, but Interway&#039;s I was rolling off as little as 100mg. I will soon be getting some of Space Factory&#039;s. If his is hq I will probably stick to him as his prices are unbeatable.

				Just as an update to my previous post, Aakoven (new vendor) got in touch with me about reshipping the missing 1g. (I ordered 2g from the old Aakoven vendor but only received 1g). However, at the end I never received the missing 1g, so I would not&nbsp; recommend this vendor.<br /><br />I also tried Farfomber&#039;s fire MDMA, and it arrived very quickly, but I found it somewhat weak. 100 g did very little to me, I had to do around 200 g to get rolling... I would rate it 6/10.

				An update to my previous posts: After having lowered the feedback on this transaction (I had received 1g instead of 2g MDMA from old Aakoven), new Aakoven contacted me and sent me 2g of MDMA, to make up for the order that I had placed with old Aakoven. So I have to say that new Aakoven is a reliable seller, who made up for the mistake of old Aakoven. This is good customer service!

				I&#039;d just get some pills with a good name for there self, so then you know that there going to be good quality, if there not fakes. <br />Might i recomend some purple defqons, or Nintendo. I&#039;ve tried both, nice smooth roll. 220mg MDMA in each, and pretty cheap in europe.<br />Can&#039;t remember who i bought them from, but i&#039;m sure you can find someone with the search bar on Silkroad.<br /><br /><br />Good luck my friend
