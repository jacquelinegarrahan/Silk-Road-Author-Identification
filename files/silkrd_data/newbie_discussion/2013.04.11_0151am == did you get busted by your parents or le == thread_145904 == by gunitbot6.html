Had the bag and pipe out on the table and my friend and his wife were waiting for the kid when he got home. They put on their &#039;disappointing parent&#039; face and said something to the effect of how they were disappointing that he couldent talk to them about something like this and how they dident want his grades to suffer and all that. Then they said they were VERY disappointed in what he was buying (some ditch weed garbage) and that they would set him straight. They then pulled out a huge bag of some awesome medical and had one big family smoke out. <br /><br />Awesome family.
