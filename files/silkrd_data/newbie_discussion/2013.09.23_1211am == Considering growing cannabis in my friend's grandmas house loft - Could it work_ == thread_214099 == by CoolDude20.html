				So my friend is living with his grandma and doesn&#039;t know and is not really interested in cannabis but does need money. We&#039;ve talked about growing cannabis in his grandmas house loft. He has had a house visit from the police for a non cannabis crime and they looked &quot;very closely in a lot of places but not in the loft&quot; apparently. Yeah I can actually see how they could miss it or just not bother, if you look at the ceiling you see it but its not like a large hatch where you see its clearly a loft. Its also a bit of a pain to get to but really not more than 5-10 min max if you have to try and figure it out. She is out a lot for a very old woman so it would be easy for us to send me up during certain times, its a pretty large house and she is pretty knocked out by her sleeping pills all night so I could spend whole nights up there during certain periods when there&#039;s a lot of work to be done. I&#039;d use all new top equipment so no fire hazards. When he first suggested it I thought he was crazy but then I saw the loft and met his grandma and it might actually work :D The chances of getting busted is very small and his grandma won&#039;t get any trouble for it, he is aware of the risks and thinks its worth it. Could it work? And probably more importantly.. how morally wrong would it be for me if I did this?

				Doesn&#039;t sound too feasible to me honestly.<br /><br />Growing entails more than just spending 5 minutes once in a while on it.&nbsp; You would have to spend entire nights up there, no doubt.&nbsp; Just buying new top of the line equipment doesn&#039;t ensure you from possible fires... I doubt there&#039;s a couple breakers dedicated to the loft.&nbsp; I doubt there&#039;s water up there. <br /><br />How are you going to cool it?... you going to vent somehow?&nbsp; Odor control?... how are you going to keep the noise down?&nbsp; &nbsp;The electricity bill?<br /><br />And you have to work around this grandma noticing?&nbsp; <br /><br />The police visit for whatever reason and search the place... not a good thing no matter how out of the way you think your grow is.<br /><br />People that get busted, don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to get busted.<br /><br />My vote is; bad idea.&nbsp; Find another place.&nbsp; (you asked)

I thought I would never got busted and never would have but my family member partner started a second grow with some noobs who got busted using too much electricity with my phone number in their grow room. Thank You family member.<br /><br />Red Flags: Police have been there once. Once is one time too much. The place is on their radar. Plus your circle of trust is too large. The only way not to get busted is if you do it yourself and no one else ever knows. You can&#039;t trust anyone..... seriously anything could happen. I mean anything, things you could never imagine. If only you know and get caught you are the only one to blame. A felony conviction will seriously hinder life accomplishments.<br /><br />Best option would be to move to Colorado or Washington state. If you live in the US

				I real grow lots of attention and care.&nbsp; Care you HVAC that loft so its always 82F~, do you have a veg chamber.&nbsp; Is there any hvac? either way you will need blowers to aircool lights just to keeps under 100.&nbsp; I say let your grandma live the rest of her life out of jail.

				You&#039;re just asking for trouble, pally. Could you do it, yeah probably. Should you do it, hell no. <br /><br />If you get a couple plants its going to smell like dank if you don&#039;t get your ventilation taken care of. Not to mention water/moister/mold damage. <br /><br />Seems to me that buying bulk here on the road then reselling would be much less of a hassle.

				Come on guys its not like I haven&#039;t thought this through, did you even read the whole post?<br /><br />First of all I can guarantee she won&#039;t get in any trouble for it. If anyone is going to get in trouble for it it will be my friend (whom is aware of the risk he would be taking) or possibly me, although I suppose I could be lucky and not be there when they come.<br /><br />This woman is old, her hearing is bad, she doesn&#039;t remember that well. Loud music doesn&#039;t seem to wake her.<br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t be a massive grow so no huge electricity bill.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t checked venting out but that shouldn&#039;t be a problem. Worst case you could just get a small ac unit and a dehumidifier. There&#039;s no reason I couldn&#039;t spend a night up there, we could put some sort of insulation padding on the ground so you could walk around and drop things without making a noice. <br /><br />Forgot to mention, obviously you would use tents with fans and carbon filters to control odor, noice reducing ducting and silencers to keep sound down, We would check if there&#039;s any sound leakage, if there is we can just add more padding. You could also use ONA gel/block as backup during smelly periods (close to harvest and so on).<br /><br />Water can be pumped up in small amounts, in fact, I could mix the nutrients downstairs and feed a hose straight to the plants, turn the pump on and water straight into the soil. No real risk of leakage if its one piece of pipe, it could only leak from the reservoir which could be safely in a bathtub or shower or in the tent which is sealed. You only need to water every 2-3 days, it shouldn&#039;t be a problem to find 20 min a day when she will be occupied or away. <br /><br />Electricity bill can be blamed on an electricity appliance, just buy a new pc chassi, she won&#039;t know/understand its just a chassi. I don&#039;t think money is an issue for her but either way my friend could pay the extra usage.<br /><br />Why so much negativity, haven&#039;t you seen breaking bad when they solve all these clever problems? I don&#039;t see any issues I can&#039;t solve, I&#039;m worried I might of overlooked something.

				led lights and 5 gallon buckets of soil should work. but you really should grow in your own place, what about getting med card to grow.<br />you really shouldnt include somone else in a felony unless they have a say in it.<br />if you do get caught the judge will throw you under the jail for putting the old lady in this mess. i would not want to go to court on that charge.<br />is there a garage or shed that you could use not in the house?<br />its not a good idea but do what you want. <br />do you know how to add a dedicated circut for power? overflow lines for leaks and all the things that a grow needs. better off trying to find a good spot.

				I&#039;m with Daryl I&#039;m afraid. Not fair on her if she doesn&#039;t know anything about it. If she found out, the shock could give her a heart attack or something, plus she&#039;d likely be very upset. She might be old dude, but she has feelings like all of us.

				You seem way to cocky. This is a bad idea. If you need money just buy on the SR and then resell. This is not a scheme to make money quickly. If you do buy state of the art equipment you&#039;d most likely be around $1000 in the hole already and then you have the long wait for it to be ready to harvest and then to dry it. All the while, either the house or the neighborhood you&#039;re venting it out into are going to smell really dank. The smell has to go somewhere. You&#039;re no Walter White. You&#039;d just end up being caught like the tons of other wannabe drug dealers who thought the same thing.

				Extremely immoral. Never grow in someone you&#039;re living in&#039;s house without their knowledge. Unless you want your grandma to die of a heart attack when she gets busted.<br /><br />Wait til you&#039;re old enough to have you&#039;re own place ;)

				If you don&#039;t want honest input, why did you ask us?&nbsp; I mean if you just wanted people to lick your ass, hire a team of gay escorts.<br /><br />Being realistic is not negative... we&#039;re telling you what we think, albeit from our limited perspective.&nbsp; And yes, I read your post.&nbsp; From what you told me, it sounds like an absolute clusterfuck.&nbsp; You might as well start growing behind your parent&#039;s garage while you&#039;re at it.<br /><br />I grew for years... and once in a while shit would slip out to this friend or that, that I was growing.&nbsp; Luckily that never got me busted... but anyhow, everyone would always come to me&nbsp; &quot;I got this closet or cabinet or whatever blah blah blah... it&#039;s perfect for growing&quot;... all of &#039;em nothing but a waste of time.&nbsp; Everyone gets enthusiastic about wanting to grow, yet you have to be realistic.<br /><br />Watering only every other 2-3 days for a non-massive grow?!... you&#039;ll be surprised how much water you go through.&nbsp; Never grew tomatoes?... flowering, those plants are like sponges and need constant H2O.&nbsp; No leakage??? lol&nbsp; Yeah, I can tell you grew before.&nbsp; So you&#039;re going to pump it from how many floors below?... right into planters?... how do you expect to watch your planter water levels and run the pump, shutting it off when you need to?&nbsp; Guess?&nbsp; If that&#039;s your plan, you&#039;re going to be getting quite annoyed with over-watering/under-watering and spills.&nbsp; 20 minutes to do all this watering? lol&nbsp; ok.<br /><br />Since this is a new grow, you&#039;ll basically have to live up there for a while setting everything up.&nbsp; Shit, grows that even got their shit together with everything automated etc., a guy has to basically live there/work full time.&nbsp; It&#039;s much more work than just tossing some seeds in the ground and walking away, and maybe do some occasionally watering.&nbsp; It can be a lot of work.<br /><br />Unless you&#039;re talking about growing 2 plants or something stupid, but then why bother?... it&#039;s just cheaper to buy it off SR.<br /><br />Then of course there&#039;s the whole moral/ethical dilemma everyone is mentioning... <br /><br />
