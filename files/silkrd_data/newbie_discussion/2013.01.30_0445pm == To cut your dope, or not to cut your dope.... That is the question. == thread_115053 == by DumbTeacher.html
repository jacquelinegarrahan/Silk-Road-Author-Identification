				Just read a comment on a post I made about the economics (6th grade economics to be exact) of cutting a gram of mdma with caffeine. I just wanted to know, how many people believe that no matter how much you pay for your dope, it is always best to cut it to stretch the profit?

				Hey DT, I didn&#039;t neg karma you :) Also, I wasn&#039;t intending to be short and rude, I&#039;ve just seen A LOT of these threads lately. <br /><br />I&#039;ve found it much more profitable to sell uncut drugs at a premium vs selling cut drugs at a cheaper price.

				You could cut your drugs, but if you do and another molly dealer is available in your area, you&#039;ll probably lose some business. Better to sell uncut and take all the business than to sell cut and only control part of the market.

				Cutting your drugs is just fine, but you&#039;re lowering the quality. I want what I pay for, and if that dude gives me better dope then screw you.

				Depends on who you&#039;re selling too. I sell only a little weed every now and then. When I sell to friends I make little to no profit. When fuckwads come up to me and ask if I have something I&#039;ll sell underweight. So if I were to sell coke or md I&#039;d probably cut it if I didn&#039;t like them :D

				It&#039;s no different than the butcher putting his thumb on the scale so he can charge you for 3 pounds of bacon when you&#039;re really getting 2.5. <br /><br />I&#039;d rather have a light bag or an expensive pill of high quality product. Also, some people are allergic to caffeine, so cutting it with caffeine and not disclosing it to your customers is negligent at best. <br /><br />This type of shit is why I buy from SR. When a dealer pulls that bullshit on the street, there&#039;s not much you can do other than maybe try to kick his ass, but that may be a good way to get your house shot up in retaliation. On SR with the escrow and feedback system, it&#039;s like having a Better Business Bureau for drug dealers and sellers who misrepresent their product are usually found out pretty quick. If people suspect the &quot;pure uncut&quot; product you&#039;re selling is less than pure or uncut, don&#039;t be surprised if someone in the community sends a sample off to a lab for analysis and shares the results on the forums and/or in your feedback. That would be if you&#039;re lucky of course. If there&#039;s any question of quality, it&#039;s all too easy to just buy from a different vendor because no matter what you&#039;re selling, there are at least half a dozen other vendors who also sell it and will be glad to provide your former customers with quality product. <br /><br />Sorry for the long winded response, but I&#039;ve been getting into the pure, uncut AND overweight product I got from one of the many fine vendors here at SR and I&#039;m just a wee bit hiiiiiigh right now. A lot higher than anyone will get off the stepped on bullshit you&#039;ll be selling anyway.

But cutting mdma? Then its better to give a smaller amount, or selling it a bit more expensive.. Or just sell it as it is..<br /><br />If you sell cutted mdma or any other psychedelic the customers will not return, thats for sure.. And if they return they only return the time to they find a better supplier..
