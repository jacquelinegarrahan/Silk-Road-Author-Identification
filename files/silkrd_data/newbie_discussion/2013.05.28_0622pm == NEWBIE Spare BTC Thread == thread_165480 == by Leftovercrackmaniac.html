				I would love a donation or two. Whole reason I&#039;m on the forums spamming up my post count is to leave a massive rant about being dicked around by a &#039;trusted&#039; vendor. Right before my birthday too hey. Only so many BTC a piss poor uni student can front up himself.<br /><br />:(

				I would love a small donation, I&#039;m having trouble getting BTC in the UK for non-ridiculous prices and am only a little short of the amount I need to purchase a birthday gift for my girlfriend on the Road. Hate to beg but any thing would be much appreciated. Hope to get into the sample review game on the SR forums soon, as a experienced drug user but SR newbie. <br />I&#039;d owe you one!!!!!<br /><br />My Address:&nbsp; &nbsp;1NFMZmLUTGwMHs2PwshgCG5LZ3z99v2fpp<br /><br /><br />Thank you so much. it would really get me out of a bit of a jam&nbsp; being a poor student and all.

				I donated the last little bit i had to adventuretime just now. I know it wasn&#039;t very much (like $1.05)&nbsp; but I know that a little bit can help something. I am waiting for people who have the heart to donate but I DO NOT WANT people to just come up here and leach off od people who have a kind heart.

				No problem at all AdventureTime haha The world needs more caring people in it and I would love to try to help make a change(: Remember if you ever have Bitcoins and you feel like helping other members then spread the love as well. I am out of btc now but I do not ask anything in return. Helping is a reward of it&#039;s own(:

				Good evening fellow Roaders. I was hoping to never end up here in this thread except for lending and I know I might be sending off some flags being relatively new but people can&#039;t really help when they need help and I could really use it now. If people are too sketched out though that&#039;s fine.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking for .3 - .7 bitcoins which I&#039;ll be able to repay partially ($25 MP as collateral) at first and then in full on Friday with 15% interest. If one person wants to send it all or multiple people send a little or if anyone wants to just send a little it would be very much appreciated and if you do so just message me with the amount and your repayment address and I&#039;ll get it back to you. I&#039;ll post your s/n in here for verification as well that you&#039;ve loaned to me. Thank you all for looking and if anyone is kind enough to help me out I promise you won&#039;t be disappointed. I took my original post down because it had some personal-ish info but I can tell you why I need this if you want to know. My BTC is :<br /><br />1GC2YoBb69d2MmmtKmLxoJ12PiGH7RAZnN<br /><br />Or you can send it to my SR name: rjbridges. Thanks!
