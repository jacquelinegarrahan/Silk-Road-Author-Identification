				Since my first visit to these pages a while back, I have seen a helluva lot of needless friction and hostility generated by inconsiderate, immature and self-obsessed individuals ... and I find this kind of thing disturbing.<br /><br />If there is absolute proof of scamming, complicity with LE, etc., then perhaps it might be acceptable to warn others, but that call ought probably be made by admins and/or those with relevant experience on SR.<br /><br />The reason I mention this is that&nbsp; the other day I was reading some highly negative comments that one person had made about a long established vendor based on nothing other than their own distorted thinking and absolutely zero evidence.<br /><br />Rather than wait for moderators and admins to investigate their grievance, the person in question seemed to go to a great deal of trouble to spread their unfounded allegations throughout these forums (fora?) and in doing so, demonstrated not only his/her own ignorance and immaturity, but showed a colossal amount of disrespect to the vendor concerned and by extension, to the community in general.<br /><br />Obviously everyone in this community has a different story and background, but I think it might be beneficial if we could discuss, define and promote awareness of, some basic standards of conduct and communication, of what is appropriate when dealing with others. <br /><br />An online community like this comprises all kinds of people from all over the world, each with their own background and experience, united by a common purpose. <br /><br />... anyhow I get the impression that the most important factor in making our time in this community as pleasant as possible is to treat others with respect, ie., the same degree of courtesy and consideration with which we would like to be treated ourselves. <br /><br />Patience, compassion, courtesy and respect go a long way to building a community where we can communicate clearly, share ideas, transact business and deal with real issues, instead of being distracted by bullshit. <br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />
