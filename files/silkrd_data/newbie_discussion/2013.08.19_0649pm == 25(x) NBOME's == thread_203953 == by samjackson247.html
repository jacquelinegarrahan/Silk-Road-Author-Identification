				I had fun experimenting with them. Now I&#039;m kind of over them. I think they&#039;re worth a try. I never tried 25i though. That&#039;s supposed to be the craziest one.

				I haven&#039;t tried any nbomes yet... but have been looking into to them as a LSD alternative... just because a good LSD trip needs 2 or 3 tabs and is just too pricey, and these NBOMEs seem to be on the cheap side... but still deciding which version of it would compare most to LSD (visuals with a sense of inner peace).<br /><br />From what i&#039;ve read the 25C and 25I variations are the most popular with the C being the cleanest. Heres a couple of good quotes i found on google the other day:<br /><br /><br />QUOTE 1:<br /><br />&quot;I have tried three different NBOMe&#039;s so far: 25c, 25i and 25d. I feel I need to push the 25d further to really appreciate its effects. I will edit this post accordingly once I have done this.<br /><br />25i and 25c both have very little mindfuck. This is a good and bad thing. You could probably comfortably have tea with your grandma on these but for the same reason they lack the psychedelic state where everything is infused with meaning. 25d has bags of this and IMO, makes the best acid replacement candidate.<br /><br />Although 25d has a deeply psychedelic nature, it doesn&#039;t display much of interest at dosage levels at which the other two shine. (Shulgin&#039;s discription of &quot;pharmacological tofu&quot; springs to mind). This isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing. The same can be said of 70µg of spanners compared to 10mg of 2c-b.I assume that the visuals kick in at higher doses because they certainly aren&#039;t present at 600-800µg intransally. I expect this to be the best of the lot though when pushed higher. It&#039;s strongly stimulating but emotionally benign similar to 2c-e but doesn&#039;t have the recreational &quot;fireworks&quot; of the other two and is much more introverted.<br /><br />25i definitely has similarities to 2c-i (good humour for instance) but lacks the gastrointestinal disturbances of the latter. There is a significant orgasmic body high with this material which makes it good for sex. Visuals are more acid-like in the sense that objects morph rather than getting covered in patterns. Overall, more interesting than 2c-i.<br /><br />25c - visuals are more mescaline-like than 25i with sparks of light and rainbows radiating from objects.The most entactogen-like emotional warmth out of the three but also the least insightful. Extremely good humoured. Feels very safe to push into high dosage realms. This one is the best of the three for party fun.<br /><br />Psychedelic ideation 25d &gt; 25i &gt; 25c<br />Low-dose visual activity 25c &gt; 25i &gt; 25d<br />Tactile stimulation 25i &gt; 25c &gt; 25d<br />Mood enhancement 25c &gt; 25i &gt; 25d<br />body load 25d &gt; 25c =&gt; 25i &quot;<br /><br /><br />QUOTE 2:<br /><br />&quot;I would agree with the above insights regarding 25C-nbome and 25I-nbome.<br /><br />25b - very visual, dosage is LESS than with 25i (dont know where the 1-5mg TRs are coming from, but that is FAR above the active range). 600-900ug is a moderate dose. bodyload is similar to 2C-X, and visuals are most similar to 2C-E if i had to compare<br /><br />25c - cant extend much on whats written above, very subtle visuals, patterning in surfaces such as grass or cloud, mood and energy lift. NO BODY LOAD whatsoever was detected.<br /><br />25i - reminded strongly of 2C-I. lots of sparkle and tracers, energy buzz through the body. feels like an improved 2ci in many ways such as bodyload and the &quot;confusion&quot; being reduced.<br /><br />25C is the best &quot;acid-replacement&quot; of the three in my opinion&quot;

				I have only tried 25i, but I enjoy it. Its VERRRRRYYYYYY visual, and there is definitely a bit of headspace at the dose I take it at (1.1mg). I didn&#039;t get much body load or notice the vasoconstriction much. I&#039;ve been dying to try some 25b, as 2c-b is probably one of my favorite drugs.

				I tried it twice, both times were nice, especially the last time. Got them from fcuck reality, blotters suppossedly 1500 ug. Took one the first time (good, but a bit underwhelming), then two. Unlike LSD, these give you a lot of energy. I had a great time being outside for hours walking and climbing in the mountains, but I would be restless as fuck if I was in my home. It took a while before I felt the effects, at first I got a really happy mood and a body feeling a bit like MDMDA, then after a couple of hours the visuals started (shroomy, lots of morphing and melting). Didn&#039;t really notice any negative effects apart from the restlessness. Easy to handle, no problem going to the store or running into people you know (though I&#039;d tell them I had a beer or two, just in case).

				Ive done 25i three times. I don&#039;t have dosages so sorry about that. i&#039;ll give a rough estimate to what I think it was though. I bought from this guy who had blue and pink tabs. He told me that i should take one blue, see how i like it and if i want to increase take a blue and a pink. But he said DO NOT take two blue. lol so I&#039;m guess maybe blue was 1000 maybe 1200. I honestly have no idea but one blue wasnt anything much at all. just a racing mind that thought about everything under the sun. the a blue and pink(forgot to mention, pink was probably around 500) and then things started moving a little and everthing that moved was delayed. I thought that was pretty awesome. nothing overwhelming but still. did that again and had same effects. please dont take these doesages seriously because THEY ARE GUESSED OUT. i dont really know how much. but hell you should try it man. everytime i did it, i got really sick the first hour, then after that, it was happy trippin for about 4 to 5 hours for me. i think you should give a whirl and let us know what you think though

				25C-NBOMe is definitely my favorite psychedelic besides psilocybin shrooms<br /><br />My experiences with it have been good every time, it&#039;s very similar to mescaline or even LSD<br /><br />If you&#039;re planning on taking any form of 25(x) as your first psychedelic, make sure you go very slow with the dosage, or try shrooms prior to it, it&#039;s a powerful substance, I tried 1MG my first trip, it blew me onto fucking mars&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />Also if you&#039;re using tabs, make sure you use it/them bucally, sublingual hardly works for me or any of my friends.<br /><br />Feel free to ask me anything, and happy tripping&nbsp; :)

				+1 kdizzle12<br /><br />OP, I highly suggest starting with under 1 milligram for your first time with any of the NBOMe&#039;s. As kdizzle12 said, make sure you do it bucally. This isn&#039;t LSD. Place the tab in between your gums and upper lip. Leave it there for ~40 minutes (I&#039;m sure somebody&#039;s going to say that&#039;s unneccessarily long but I like to make sure everything gets absorbed) and make sure not to swallow your saliva, eat, or drink. If you accidentally swallow once or twice, you&#039;ll still be okay so don&#039;t freak out.

				I&#039;ve only tried 25i<br />Prefer it over LSD apart from the lack of spiritual stuff and feeling connected to everything<br />On 25i I love the visuals, but it&#039;s like nothing could turn it into a bad trip. Once I felt a bit anxious after taking a whole tab (1200ug) when the visuals came on after 30 minutes Very strong, but effects stopped after 4-5 hours and fell asleep about 6 hours after taking it, I think due to tolerance from the 1200ug i took a week earlier. but always after the first 1:30 to 2 hours its smooth sailing for me. <br /><br />Doses in the order I&#039;ve taken them - 300ug test run, slight visuals, good closed eye visuals like watching a 3d movie<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 400ug + 200ug re dose 3 hours later - compared to about half a tab of LSD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 800ug + 400ug re dose 4 hours later - moderate visuals, auditory hallucinations, strong closed eye visuals<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1200ug 1 day after previous dose to test tolerance, little to no visuals, slight euphoria<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1000ug + 200ug re dose 10 minutes later - intense visuals for 2 hours then tapered off and within 6 hours was asleep, 1 week tolerance <br /><br />Next dose will be 1200ug with hopefully no tolerance after I have a acid trip might eat a few tabs<br /><br />All times tab was help on upper gum trying not to swallow for at least 30 minutes<br /><br />

				It&#039;s great to hear some of your stories about this substance. We have recently set up on SR selling 25c and 25i NBOMe.<br /><br />We also have a brand new product, our strawberry snuff caps available in both 25i and 25c. These are insufflated which means they are faster acting and give more of an intense high. <br /><br />Why not check out our page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/98db359d14
