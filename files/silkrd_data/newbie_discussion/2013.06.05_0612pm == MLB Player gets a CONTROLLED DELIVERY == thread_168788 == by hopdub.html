				I suspect he can afford good lawyers and will be all right.<br /><br />Probably some steroid crap - the postal workers noticed it? If true, it&#039;s amateur hour at whoever he placed the order with.

				Someone should really post this in the &quot;Shipping&quot; forum. I see people saying they won&#039;t do CDs on small amounts. If this turns out to be a &quot;stick of butter&quot; sized package as some reports suggest...thats crazy! What a waste of time and money either way really.

				Could have been the perfect storm of postal workers accidentally intercepting the package, then someone in LE realising that this guy&#039;s a big fish (the kind that it&#039;s useful to make an example of) and that let&#039;s set up a controlled delivery, and then the guy himself not giving a shit about what he&#039;s signing for.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t get is why he&#039;d bother with SR?

If we were rich and powerful jetsetting types, we&#039;d know (or at least our personal assistants would know) exactly how to get hold of whatever the hell we want when we fly into Rangoon or Kinshasa or Ulaan Baatar. <br /><br />We little people have to source our drugs directly, and this can involve all sorts of uncertainties and indignities, but this website is an enormously empowering trading platform for us little people. <br /><br />So screw these celebs who can&#039;t take care of their own business. I&#039;ll bet he has great lawyers who will deliver a favourable verdict - if not, a favourable sentence.

				Thizzed - good point. I assumed. I made an Ass (out of) u (and) me. Perhaps more just me. You&#039;re right - perhaps he&#039;s ordering skunk through the mail from complete amateurs (that would explain why his package was detected) and don&#039;t know nothing about SR, as he&#039;s having a hard enough time wrapping his head around the internet, let alone the darknet.

				From the news<br />&quot;Inside one of the Priority Mail packages mailed from Los Angeles was 6.2 ounces of marijuana concealed in four separate Ziplock bags, which were in two containers wrapped in a shirt, according to the postal inspector report. The second package had 3.45 ounces in two Ziplock bags, two containers and wrapped in a white towel. The bags were coated in Vaseline&#039;

Still, the marketplace is Darwinian - particularly so when effective discretion and stealth are the primary bulwarks holding out the prohibitionist barbarians. Klutzy vendors won&#039;t be in business long. So while there are some dopes selling dope on SR, the average trader&#039;s pretty sharp, and the top traders are smooth operators. They had to be to last so long. <br />
