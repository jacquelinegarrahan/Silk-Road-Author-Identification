				Hello all, Im just wondering if anyone knows the easiest way to fund your SR account with bitcoins. I have paypal, credit, etc. But I dont want to pay the damn 50% markup that some of these people are wanting for them. I dont mind a 10% etc markup on the bitcoins. But Im wanting to fund my SR account, and Im wanting the easiest way to do this, because 1. I work all the damn time. 2. I always look for the easiest way to do things. 3. Im getting old and lazy. Simple as that. So, any help would be greatly appreciated. Hell Id even get a moneypak if theres a way to do it with one of those...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />FallenKnight

				If you&#039;re in the US, the easiest way to get bitcoins would be to make a cash deposit to bitfloor, then withdraw the funds to your SR wallet. Make a bitfloor account using a public computer since you can&#039;t go on there with tor. You could also check localbitcoins out, and meet with someone to pay him bitcoins in cash (the fee is like 5% usually). For bitfloor the fee is less than 1% and you get a good exchnge rate thanks to tools like &quot;limit order&quot; and stuff. I&#039;d look at the stickied threads in the security section and search for &quot;bitfloor&quot; on the forums to learn more about how to do that. If you&#039;re not in the US, use localbitcoins, but don&#039;t pay through paypal or something like that, only cash.

				The last few times I needed to fund my account, I used Bitinstant and couldn&#039;t have been happier. I even made one BTC purchase from them during the few weeks that the &quot;pay to BTC address&quot; feature on their site was disabled. I made a Bitstamp account and used that option and it was just as easy. After that I read they got hacked, but I don&#039;t know if there is any truth to that. Anybody used Bitinstant lately?

				For the first step of converting cash to BTC, I used to use Bitinstant with zero problems.&nbsp; After their recent drama, I switched to Bitfloor which was perhaps even smoother.<br /><br />Then I tumble the coins a bit using this method:<br /><br />Withdraw from Bitfloor to clearnet Instawallet<br />Open Torified local Bitcoin wallet (let me know if you need details on Torifying wallet)<br />Create a new BTC address in wallet<br />Send from clearnet Instawallet to Torified local wallet<br />Send from Torified local wallet to new Instawallet in Tor (not clearnet!)<br />New Tor ID<br />Create a new SR BTC address<br />New Tor ID<br />Send from Tor Instawallet to SR BTC address<br />Delete BTC address from local wallet each time<br /><br />I start a new Tor ID session so that I am not using the same IP to access both the Instawallet and my SR account.&nbsp; This may be overkill, not sure.<br /><br />Always use PGP for your address!<br /><br />Enjoy the road.

				That&#039;s a really good way to get your bitcoins, it&#039;s how Pine said it should be done I think. But bitfloor -&gt; silkroad is safe enough if you use a computer that&#039;s not yours and can&#039;t be traced to you IMHO. If you&#039;re dealing with huge amounts it&#039;s better to be on the safe side though.

				If your deposit was anonymous, I think transferring directly to your SR address is safe enough. I do the same, based on what other members said. If your deposit was truly anonymous I don&#039;t see how it could be traced back to you anyways. Some mistakes could make it easier for your coins to be traced back to you, which is why newbottle&#039;s way is better I think. You should request a new SR wallet address each time you make a deposit though.<br /><br />bogdanlis, you&#039;re in a state without any Bank of America? If you really can&#039;t use bitfloor, maybe you can use bitinstant (more expensive and more annoying), or maybe just go with localbitcoins...

				After much time lurking I finally made my first bitcoin purchase and deposit today. I used bitcopia and the process was smooth and completed within an hour and a half. They take Wells Fargo so if you live near one than it&#039;ll be very easy. Went to their site and completed the purchase order at 2:10 p.m. eastern time (put in the number of coins I wanted to purchase then put in my SR address), copied the checking account number and went over. Got a deposit slip and only had to put down the account number, the cost, and my signature (I signed my name but suppose if you needed to you could use a fake one; no biggie either way as no i.d. was required). It says on the site it could take up to two hours but I got the confirmation e-mail saying my coins were depositied at 3:45 p.m. Extremely simple and if I decide to buy anymore coins it will be from them.

				Assuming one were to make the transfer from BitFloor to SR on a computer that was linked to him, how much does this compromise the whole security thing? In other words, could LE figure out where the bitcoins went? Or does SR&#039;s tumbling prevent this? I guess I&#039;m slightly worried that if LE intercepted a package, they could theoretically get the recipient&#039;s IP and then see that he bought bitcoins and transferred them to SR. Is this a legitimate concern?

				If the computer is linked to you, LE could know that you bought bitcoins, they won&#039;t really bother to look whether or not they&#039;ve been transferred to an SR wallet or not, they probably don&#039;t know all SR wallet addresses. It&#039;s still better to buy bitcoins through an anonymous cash deposit and use your own computer and IP than wiring money to a bitcoin exchange site leaving an actual money trail. The main concern is that money trails to bitcoin exchanges + an intercepted package has been enough to obtain a search warrant against someone on here apparently. The guy used his bank account though so there&#039;s that.

				Hi, I don&#039;t suppose anyone can ink me to our write up here a similar process but for those of us living in the UK?&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to leave a paper trail of my money going into Bitcoin and so far all I have seen is about making a SEPA transfer.<br /><br />Thanks in advance...
