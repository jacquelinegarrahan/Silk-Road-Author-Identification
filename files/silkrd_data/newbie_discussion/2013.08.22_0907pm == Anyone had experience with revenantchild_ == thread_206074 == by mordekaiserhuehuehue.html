				So I ordered 5 grams of durban poison from him, it hasn&#039;t arrived, he offered me to choose from 100% refund or a resend, I chose a resend, now 27 days have passed since he sent out the resend and it still hasn&#039;t arrived, I&#039;m not sure what to do now, should I keep waiting? Have you guys had any experience with him? I don&#039;t wanna ask for a refund now because he&#039;d probably think I&#039;m a massive asshole. :\
