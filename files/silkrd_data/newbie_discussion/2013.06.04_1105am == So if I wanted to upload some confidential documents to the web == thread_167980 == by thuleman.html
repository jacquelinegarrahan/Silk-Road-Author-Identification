				This is serious guys. Wikileaks is crap, you can&#039;t find anything in there. I gave them a whole file on JP Morgan falsifying their OTC derivative trading accounts in the Asia region. These false accounts were then sent to the Fed showing. I was the one being ordered to do this so had all the info, stats, names, instructions, how, when. This happened in 2005 and 2006 and nothing was done about it, either by Wikileaks or the regulators when I contacted them. You all know what happened the following year. I&#039;ve got emails from the regulator saying that they won&#039;t bother investigating.<br /><br />I need something which is well know and where I can post the info myself and not have to rely on some anti-american dissenter.

				It sounds like you might be better off going straight to the press. If your goal is raising awareness of wrongdoing then it&#039;s got to reach the papers somehow. Using a site like wikileaks to get it there seems like an unnecessary middleman. If it&#039;s a really big scoop then take it to a high profile, respected journalist who specializes in the field concerned. They should be able to guarantee anonymity.
