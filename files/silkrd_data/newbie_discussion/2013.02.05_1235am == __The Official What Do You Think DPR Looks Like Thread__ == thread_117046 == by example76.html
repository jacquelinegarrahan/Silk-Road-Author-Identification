				I expect he looks like the spoon kid from The Matrix, bald and in the robes, and just roams the land preaching about cryptoanarchy, and sometimes just transforms into a ball of pure energy and disappears into the sky.

				DPR is not a person.<br />He&#039;s a FBI project. Since they fail the war on drugs, it&#039;s time to change the tactics.<br />Now we&#039;d have a great drug market with purest and cheap substances in the world.. so street dealers can&#039;t stand the competition anymore.<br />Soon no street dealers would be.<br />And THEN Silkroad will be shut down.<br />War on drugs ends with total authorities victory.<br />Until new generation of street dealers come..

				Or maybe he&#039;s had multiple two-way data-feeds spliced directly into his spinal cord, cyborg style, so as to maintain control of his empire via real-time thought mapping. Or something...

				I&#039;ve always imagined him to be a completely ordinary looking middle-aged guy who no-one would ever suspect of being one of the most blatant and prolific enemies the war on drugs has ever seen. The kind of person every cop would just walk past on the street without looking twice at. The kind of person you could spend months hanging out with and you&#039;d never know that he runs this place.<br /><br />I hope he never gets found. The DEA would never let him see the outside of a cell if they caught up with him, no matter where in the world he was. It&#039;s easy not to appreciate the kind of risk he&#039;s taking with his freedom just so we can have the privilege of using this place.
