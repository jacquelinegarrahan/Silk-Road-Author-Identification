				Is there any steps to use or something you should do rather than do before?&nbsp; I use TAILS and have had success with that.&nbsp; When TAILS updates are they using the newest versions of Tor?&nbsp; Just looking foe any general insite or knowledge that anyone will have on this topic with the NSA at all.<br /><br />Thanks

				What are you talking about man, it&#039;s almost impossible for the NSA to crack modern encryption methods like PGP.<br /><br />Wait, are they running quantum computers?

				The encryption they&#039;re speaking of lies in these categories:<br />commercial encryption software<br />https and other encryption standards that are used for secure website logins, banking, etc.<br />VPNs<br /><br />So far there is NO indication that TOR or PGP have been compromised.<br />All those folks acessing SR over those .tor links are fooked though.

				There has been talk that the standard 1024bit encryption is weak, thats why there are 2048 and higher options if you use the bottom rung expect to be grabbed first..<br />As for TOR having problem ie running extremely slow its because the users went from 500,000 to 3,500,000 in a matter of days, believed to be a botnet as unimaginable that many people started using TOR since there hasnt been that many extra downloads, I upgraded to the new beta version that runs differently and seems a bit more stable and slightly more reliable <br /><br />On a side note which retard thinks hidding a 3,000,000+ computer botnet behind 4000 nodes will work?

				i use hotspot shield (vpn) along with tor. i actually emailed my vpn provider for their thoughts. which i doubt the nsa cares about &quot;legal&quot;. this was the reply they gave me:<br /><br />Sep 07 14:01 (PDT):<br />Hello,<br /><br />We do not keep logs or data of our users so they would not be able to access that information because it doesn&#039;t exist in the first place. They would have to physically tap in to and break our algorithm in order to accomplish spying. That of course is illegal.

				I have privateinternetaccess as a vpn because you can pay with BTC but just run tails for the most part now&nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure of the point running a botnet through tor, trying to hide which as stated earlier not going to work too well or they are trying something out who knows, only Vlad
