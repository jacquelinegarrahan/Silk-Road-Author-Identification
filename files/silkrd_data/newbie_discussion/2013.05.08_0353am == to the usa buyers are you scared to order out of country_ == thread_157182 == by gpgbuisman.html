				I&#039;m not from The US, but I am from AUS and I&#039;m worried about buying internationally. For me domestic is the way to go, lest risk but the prices are inflated... <br />There&#039;s no recommendation whether you should/shouldn&#039;t buy internationally. I do recommend taking precautions such as doing your research on a vendor and making sure the feedback notes that they take good care into concealing their products past customs. No rash decisions. <br /><br />All the best.

				Not to mention, I&#039;m pretty sure there would be foreign stamps which would raise suspicion from other people living at my house.

				It&#039;s certainly riskier, but I think for low quantities that you don&#039;t mind losing (and ordering infrequently) you should be okay. Most of my limited transactions have been international and they&#039;ve not yet been problematic. I would definitely stop ordering to an address if more than 1 package failed to arrive.

				It&#039;s not too big of a deal for things that aren&#039;t very detectable, like LSD for example.&nbsp; However, I&#039;d personally only go with a vendor who is established and doesn&#039;t have any issues with stealth at all whatsoever since there is the extra step of customs.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m 1/3 on non domestic orders. Just as I began to give up on SR a well known vendor from Germany womped me In the nose with the sexiest most stealthy package I have ever laid eyes on! I went as far as messaging the vendor bitching about how instead of rocks I received &quot;feminine products&quot;. In turn I received ego death and a new perspective on life.<br /><br />Basically It&#039;s up to you and how stealthy the vendor Is
