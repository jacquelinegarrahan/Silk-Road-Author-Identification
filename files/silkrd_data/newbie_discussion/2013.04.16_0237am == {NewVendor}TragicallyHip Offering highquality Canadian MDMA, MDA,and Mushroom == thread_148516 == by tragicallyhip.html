				Hello there fellow silk road members!<br /><br />Because I am tired of posting spam (trying to reach 50 posts so I can post this thread in the more appropriate forum), I&#039;ve decided to go ahead and start a newbie vending page, just to get my name out there, supply you guys with some pictures of the products, let you know a little more about them and lastly, answer any questions you may have for me!<br /><br />I hope that I can acquire a good relationship with my future customers, through courteous and friendly customer service, professional and timely shipping, and the constant availability of high quality products (MDMA, MDA, Mushrooms, and eventually, Cannabis) at excellent prices.<br /><br /><br />To start off, I have attatched some picture links below. The larger rocks are a nice light brown MDMA crystal. Very tasty stuff. The brown sand is MDA crystals, and of course the mushrooms!<br /><br />I am about to add my first listings in the next few hours, so keep an eye out for those on the SR <br /><br />A question brough up by a fellow member that I feel should be answered clearly : <br /><br />quote from styossarian: &quot;just out of curiousity though, do you have experience sending packages internationally, or are you a noob at that as well? &quot;<br /><br />I would like to let you all know, I have previously vended on a market that is no longer around. I have succesfully shipped 100s of packages of cannabis, mdma, and ground mushrooms to various continents throughout the world. As for right now, I have limited shipping options for my mushrooms MDA and MDMA but be assured, I am a very new vendor and this will change!<br /><br />Here we go folk finally got some pics!!!<br /><br />MDMA : http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/7476/img4959zl.jpg<br />MDA:http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/2968/img4967yi.jpg<br />Psilocybe Cubensis Mushrooms:http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/6108/img4965.JPG<br /><br /><br />And were at it! TragicallyHips first SR listings are now viewable!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a0cf447737<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/90afc35ac5<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/71040c76ab<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/10ad7b5ede<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/255c014ad0<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9c77594ab1<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5e54f27b17<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a7dc13b430<br /><br />Cannabis coming in near future.<br />

				Will you ship international?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been wondering for a while if it is a good idea for people in the US to order from our brothers to the north. I know it would be labeled as international so it would be expected to take longer than domestic orders. But I&#039;m not familiar with how international packages are handled and almost all of the time I read about packages not arriving it is from an international order. If anyone is more familiar with how the system works I would love to hear some input. I&#039;m not sure if ordering from Canada is as risky as ordering from overseas.

				this is relevant to my interests.<br /><br />just *how* superior are we talking? i am very familiar with canadian (quebecois) mdma quality so if you can deliver nice quantities of high quality product for very reasonable prices, i will definitely be doing business with you ;D<br /><br />just out of curiousity though, do you have experience sending packages internationally, or are you a noob at that as well?

				Hello there, glad to answer your question!<br /><br />I have just put up a few listings, they have a little bit more about the details of shipping.<br /><br />Psilocybe Cubensis mushrooms are ground up before shipping outside of Canada. This is to ensure they will not be detected by LEO. I used to sell mushrooms on a former market and learned this was the best way for me to ensure product delivery to international customers.<br /><br />As for domestic shipping, in Canada I do not mind shipping the mushrooms whole.<br /><br />And for MDMA, and MDA they are broken down to reasonable sized crystals and vacuum sealed. It&#039;s very unlikely something like this will be seized by LEO.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also. I&#039;m about to edit my main thread with links to my first listings I&#039;ve put up on the silk.<br /><br /><br />Thanks all!<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />Styossarian, glad this is relevant to your interests. I am sure this quality of MDMA will be very similar to the high quality stuff you find in say, Montreal.<br /><br />Also, an excellent question that I will be updating not only my main thread, to better address, but also my silk road profile, so kudos for mentioning it.<br /><br />quote from styossarian: &quot;just out of curiousity though, do you have experience sending packages internationally, or are you a noob at that as well? &quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I would like to let you all know, I have previously vended on a market that is no longer around.

				Just wanted to let folks know that I received my order :) Fast shipping, product was discreetly packaged (just fine for domestic purposes, you may want to update your stealth for international orders), and vacuum sealed several times with zero smell escaping. When I cut it open however, I was greeted with incredible smelling MDA that was obviously overweight. I actually have an urge to run over and sniff it again, it smelled that amazing. <br /><br />Thank you very much TH, I would have no qualms about using you again and will update as soon as I get a chance to test the product.

				Just wanted to post here to say that TH has the BEST mdma I&#039;ve ever tried. I took 150 mgs one night and was overwhelmed. Eye flutters like crazy and whole body rushing. Was at the bar but had to go sit in the car to try and ground myself for a bit haha.
