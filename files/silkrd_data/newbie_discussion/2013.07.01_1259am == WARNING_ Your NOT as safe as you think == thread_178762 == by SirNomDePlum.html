				I know the papers presented on the following link will be way above what most of you noobs understand (no disrespect intended - I&#039;m only trying to help). BUT, do your best to try to understand them. Read them and if you don&#039;t understand something but feel as if something specific you are reading is important to understand then start teaching yourself about it. Study it, learn it because if you don&#039;t it could mean your freedom and liberty. Or, if you absolutely don&#039;t have the time or the ability to understand the things you are reading then get on here and find someone experienced to ask. Do not underestimate the enemy. Do not underestimate the enemy&#039;s capabilities. Do not get lulled into a false sense of security. There are ways to be secure. It can be done if done correctly.

				To be frank with you anonymity is kind of our thing.<br /><br />We already know we are observed, in fact the whole world knows that we are being observed. Even the general population knows.<br /><br />It&#039;s more of a matter of teaching grandma how to stay anonymous or teaching non-tech savy friends. We are well aware.<br /><br />Plus from what I saw those aren&#039;t even tutorials, just cryptographic concepts outlined.<br /><br />In fact if you want a great website to use in order to tell people that they&#039;re not as safe as they think, try CLEARNET WARNING https://securityinabox.org.

				What&#039;s the roundtable?<br /><br />EDIT: I found answer to my own question from Libertas (SR admin). &quot;I just want to clarify that the Vendor Blacklist in the Vendor Roundtable is an informal list kept amongst vendors; it has no official standing on the site, nor is it supported by Silk Road. Vendors are free to keep such informal lists amongst themselves (as buyers are - and do - in the Rumor Mill) as long as they do not reveal a buyer&#039;s personal information.&quot;<br /><br />So apparently it&#039;s a forum exclusive to vendors where they can discuss unsatisfactory buyers. Fair enough.<br /><br />But don&#039;t take my word for it. Search the forums yourself.<br />
