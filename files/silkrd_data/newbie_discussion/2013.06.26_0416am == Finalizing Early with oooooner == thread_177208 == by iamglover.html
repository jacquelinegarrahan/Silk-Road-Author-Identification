				Has anyone finalized early with the seller oooooner? I really want to buy something from them but because I only have two ratings they want me to finalize early... anyone have any experience with this seller??? His feedback indicates that he is legit.

				Yah - I combed through his history and it shows others that say &quot;FE&#039;d it was fine&quot; or &quot;FE&#039;d Will update when package arrives&quot; I would imagine he has 9 months of service on silkroad and 100% positive reviews and pages and pages of reviews that this seller wouldn&#039;t want to F up his reputation by suddenly scamming some n00b but you never know...<br /><br />How can I build a rep for myself without finalizing early? It seems like all the prescription drug sellers require it!

				Just a quick note - I refused to finalize early with this seller and he refunded my order. He kinda freaked out about it. So w/e at least I didn&#039;t get screwed over and got my funds back!

				If you FE you have absolutely no protection...remember that. The vendor could potentially not even ship your order and just pocket the money!

				Yes - what they all said!<br /><br />Trouble is that if you FE, and the stuff doesn&#039;t come, you will be out of pocket.<br /><br />Having said that, being a newbie you will have to find a vendor that sells to someone with a low amount of transactions.
