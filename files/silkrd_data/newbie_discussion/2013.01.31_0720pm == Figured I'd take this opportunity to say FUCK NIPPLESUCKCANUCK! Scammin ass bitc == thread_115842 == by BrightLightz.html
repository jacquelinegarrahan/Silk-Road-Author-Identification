				First off you cant blame this on anyone but yourself for FE&#039;ing for a mere 10% bonus!!!!! NSC has been know for fucking up shipments sense he started vending here!!!<br /><br />On another note have you tried contacting NSC and polity asking him about a reship or refund???&nbsp; NSC is very understanding and really doesn&#039;t try and scam anyone!!&nbsp; Example: I ordered a pack and after 30 days of not showing i got a 100% refund from SR staff (BECAUSE i didn&#039;t FE), well a few weeks later i get the pack in the mail!! If he was scamming i wouldn&#039;t have received that pack!!<br /><br />Now there is no doubt that NSC is running a unorganized operation and he hasn&#039;t been able to improve even tho he says he has...But hes not scamming just very very unorganized..<br /><br />lesson of the day:&nbsp; DONT FE for anyone....... how many times does this have to be said people??

				FE at your own peril.&nbsp; It makes no sense to give a stranger your money at the corner and expect them to come back, so why is it safe on the internet.<br /><br />On the other hand, international shipments have a FE class of there very own.

				Oh I fully understand it&#039;s my fault for finalizing early. But I can absolutely blame nipplesuckcanuck for not providing the product that I paid for. FE or not. A deal is a deal. I contacted him after 30 days. Talked to him here and there for 30+ more days after that. I have always been very calm and understanding with my responses. I got excuse after excuse until he finally just completely stopped responding. Last I heard about 25 days ago he was going to &quot;Check with his shipping department&quot;. I waited over a week for a response and got none. I have since sent a few more polite messages asking for an update. I see he logs in pretty much daily. Alas, my messages go unread, even though he apparently logs in everyday.<br /><br />I also fully understand that I shouldn&#039;t put in any money I can&#039;t afford to lose. I lost the money. It&#039;s not that big of a deal really. I learned a lesson that I shouldn&#039;t be so trusting even if recent vendor feedback looks promising. I&#039;ve already bought plenty more acid since then from all around better vendors. I moved on.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">NSC is very understanding and really doesn&#039;t try and scam anyone!!&nbsp; Example: I ordered a pack and after 30 days of not showing i got a 100% refund from SR staff (BECAUSE i didn&#039;t FE), well a few weeks later i get the pack in the mail!!

Things worked out for you and I&#039;m happy for you (really!). This one incident does nothing to prove he&#039;s not scamming people. It actually helps his scam quite a bit to have people like you reassuring people like me that &quot;Oh, he&#039;s no scammer look what he did for me! He&#039;s an upstanding gentleman with an unorganized operation. He&#039;ll come through eventually!&quot; In fact your reassurance probably helped push me to buy from him. Of course I FE&#039;d all on my own out of stupidity.<br /><br />He obviously posts way more acid quantities than he actually has access too. Then lures people in to FE for 10% bonus. He hasn&#039;t even logged into the forum since December 15th. He won&#039;t even try to come up with an excuse for his actions. His rating is down to 80%. I&#039;m not the only one he&#039;s done this to! Also, he&#039;s holding on to addresses for god knows how long! He offered me a reship 45 days after I ordered and didn&#039;t even ask for my address again. No surprise it never showed! It probably got mailed out to one of his other clients as free bonus acid. Just like you!<br /><br />Unorganized - YES<br />Scamming - YES (I am living proof of that)<br />Dangerous for anyone to order from - YES<br /><br />I had a lot of posts to make to climb out of newbie status. I hadn&#039;t seen much on the forums discrediting NSC. So I thought I&#039;d share my experience. If by some miracle he turns around and fixes my situation, I&#039;ll gladly remove any negative thing I&#039;ve ever said about him. I know it was silly to FE for a measly 10%. But I&#039;ve also been trying to build up rapport with established vendors. I have FE&#039;d several times as an act of good faith for trusted vendors. 1 time out of 10 I got ripped. Shit happens.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Don&#039;t FE unless you&#039;re ready to lose your money. And don&#039;t buy anything from nipplesuckcanuck unless you&#039;re looking for trouble.

I&#039;m over it. Just hurts a little when everyone was raving about his lucy and I never even got to try it. Awesome vendors like 3Jane make up for these people. And you were correct originally. I have nobody to blame but myself for FEing.

				NSC is the only negative experience I have had with a vendor so far.&nbsp; I placed an order late December and it was marked in transit on Jan 1.&nbsp; A week after I ordered I contacted the vendor to let them know that I needed the product before I took a vacation at the end of Jan.&nbsp; NSC replied that all shipping issues had been resolved and that I would have it any day!<br /><br />I contacted him a few days before the transaction was due to autofinalize and explained that I had never needed to use the resolution center and did not want to ding my buyer stats but didn&#039;t want to release the funds until I got the letter.&nbsp; I got no response so I submitted an extension for two weeks and that was approved.&nbsp; I placed an order with Tesselated to cover my vacation and received those in about a week and it was damn good stuff.<br /><br />Now those two weeks are up and I am back from vacation and I have asked for a refund.&nbsp; If this vendor hadn&#039;t gone dark on me and stopped responding to inquiries I might be willing to wait a bit longer.&nbsp; I only have $150 tied up in this and it is still in escrow but the unprofessionalism that this vendor has displayed with me makes me not want to have anything else to do with them.<br /><br />
