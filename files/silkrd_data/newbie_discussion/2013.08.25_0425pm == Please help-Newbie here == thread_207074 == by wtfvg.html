				Hello Peeps-<br />I created an account about a week ago and purchased through 4 diff vendors on SR-all for different products :) <br />Anyway, 1 went into &quot;transit&quot; the next day, the 2nd has communicated well w/me, and the 3rd-who did not even seem aware I had placed an order for a decent amount of pls, and the last-well, from what I have read he is now operating under a new Vendor name as the previous one he/she was operating under was banned.<br />I finally got an answer from the 4th &amp; questionable vendor stating that he did not have the exact product I ordered but something similar...by this point it has been 4 days and I was just like-Ok fu** it, pls just send it..sinceI had paid an arm &amp; leg to get quick shipment. Not to mention, I was the one who had to initiate contact about why my order hadnt shipped.<br />Heres the weird part...after this messaging, I wrote him again and said...if you cant ship it today pls just cancel so I can purchase elsewhere...I wasnt rude about it or anything. Clearly he is busy and thats fine, and he clearly specializes in product I was not ordering that takes more time to package/ship, etc. What I was ordering is pee-wee shit compared to his other inventory. Anywoo, I go to login later that day and it appears my account is poof! just gone. I cannot login. I was able to create another login to contact/support ticket- but does this sound weird?? I had only a small amount of btc in the og account.<br />I did not FE or anything like that. I did do some research. Weirded out though now that I have read this vendor has had issues. <br />Actually, it seems like only 1/4 seem to be efficient, or maybe its just me lol. Has anyone ever had this happen??? <br />I really of course like the idea of SR but frankly if this is what I have to go through for stuff I can get from my dr for 1/2 the cost-Im done.
