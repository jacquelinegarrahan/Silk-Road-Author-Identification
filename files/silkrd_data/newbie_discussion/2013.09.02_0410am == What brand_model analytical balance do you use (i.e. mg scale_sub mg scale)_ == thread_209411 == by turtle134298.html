				Wait, you do have an analytical balance with a minimum resolution of a mg right?&nbsp; Well, I won&#039;t totally get into why you should have one but safety is the #1 reason.&nbsp; Sure,&nbsp; you don&#039;t need a mg scale to measure out 7g&#039;s of sativa, but what about heroin, powdered xanax, and research chemicals.&nbsp; There an off dose may lead to an 8 hour bad trip or even worse.&nbsp; These balances use magnetic force restoration technology (as opposed to strain gauge) and are more accurate, precise, and have better repeatability (that shard of ice your weighing 3 times will have weights of 1.756g, 1.751g, and 1.758g instead of 1.6g, 1.9g, and 1.8g.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp; You know you got a sixteenth in the first place but how much did you really get in the second case?&nbsp; A gram and a half, 2gs, 1.75gs?)<br /><br />But, I don&#039;t always practice what I preach.&nbsp; I recently had the opportunity to purchase a well taken care of Mettler Toledo PB-503S/FACT for a little under $450 (including shipping).&nbsp; While the balance was great, the $45 for shipping was not well spent and the balance was broke on arrival and I had to return it for a refund.&nbsp; So, I am without a balance.&nbsp; But, I&#039;m also without drugs so it works out.&nbsp; But, I&#039;m saving for another balance now something with a resolution of 0.1mg at least and I plan on spending more if need be and this time I&#039;ll make sure the vendor know how to pack a delicate balance!!!&nbsp; So, I&#039;m partial to Mettler Toledo.&nbsp; What are you folks using?
