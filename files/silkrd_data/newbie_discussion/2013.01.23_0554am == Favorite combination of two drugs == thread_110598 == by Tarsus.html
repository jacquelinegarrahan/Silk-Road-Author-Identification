				What is your favorite combination of two drugs? <br /><br />Personally I like to mix molly with any psychedelic (LSD, 25i, or shrooms). Trippin&#039; and rollin&#039; balls. Perfect for parties and raves

				I&#039;d have to say Methylone and MDMA (Molly).<br /><br />Methylone is very affordable, can be had in very large quanitities for bulk prices, and helps make molly stretch further.<br /><br />MDMA / Molly is very expensive, so methylone can help fill it out. Combined, it provides a solid rolling experience.<br /><br />Great for cuddling with your special someone to electronic music.

				Mazed, I&#039;ve always loved tramadol especially in time release, and just recently had the chance to try Tapentadol and it was basicaly tramadol with more euphoria. I also noticed 100% more pain relief at minimum.<br /><br /><br />MDMA + K: Beautiful visuals. Most intense hallucinating I&#039;ve ever had, and I&#039;ve done many, many drugs.<br /><br />Meth + MDMA: Best euphoria I ever had (taken orally).<br /><br />Meth + Benzos: Great high, no comedown. The perfect drugs IMO.

				I haven&#039;t tried either yet, but LSD + benzos are something I want to have on-hand. I&#039;ve heard from multiple people that a bad LSD trip can be handled very very easily and effectively by a small dose of a benzo.

I wouldn&#039;t say favorite. Maybe most out of control. Once I took 10mg of clonazepam and drank my ass off. They found me pass out outside my dorm at noon the following morning, with a loaded bowl in my hand. Two years later I decided I was more mature, better able to handle the benzo/alcohol combination, and I was wrong. Mixed 6mg of xanex with a bottle of vodka and swallowed my buddy&#039;s house key. I still have the x-ray from that one. <br /><br />My favorite combo is coke + oxy. I don&#039;t even want to know what a speedball feels like.

				I don&#039;t do it anymore, but I used to dump a little dust oil on a stone or plate, and roll crack rocks in it. I used a stem pipe with screen to catch the oil. Scoop it up in the pipe, melt the rock to the screen, and turn the whole thing over. BLAUH! Shit used to have me waking up on the floor.<br /><br />Before that, I was in love with raw cocaine and weed in a blunt. It gave me this power stoned feeling that I loved. I smoked some &quot;mash&quot; cocaine with a south american guy once. He rolled it up in this weird paper, but it gave me almost the same feeling, not quite as trippy.
