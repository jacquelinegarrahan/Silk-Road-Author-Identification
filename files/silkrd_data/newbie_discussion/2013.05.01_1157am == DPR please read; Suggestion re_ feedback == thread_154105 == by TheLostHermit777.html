				I&#039;ve noticed about 70% of a vendors feedback is comprised of people saying &quot;Finalized early, will update when arrived&quot;. I think you should put up a notice on the feedback page stating that feedback is final and cannot be updated. A person could quite easily build up a decent positive reputation simply asking for people to FE and leave that 70% of newbies to give them 5/5 before receiving any package. <br /><br />Also perhaps give some suggestions as to what to write, I noticed quite a few feedbacks simply saying &quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;great&quot;, silly things like that. There&#039;s no point leaving feedback if you&#039;re not really going to leave feedback. Things like &quot;How stealthy was the package?&quot;, &quot;How long did it take to arrive?&quot;, &quot;Is it as described?&quot; etc. Would make SR a lot more suited for people who want to get not just a cheap, anonymous deal but good quality stuff that&#039;s confirmed for it&#039;s truth by another, as feedback should be.<br /><br />As always, thank you for your work and good to see SR is back on-line; I know you want to keep SR as cheap as possible for it&#039;s users, but perhaps you should look into investing in decent DDoS protection if you&#039;re able to do so anonymously. I&#039;d be happy to chip in and I&#039;m sure many others would be if it means ~24/7 uptime.
