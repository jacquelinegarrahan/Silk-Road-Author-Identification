				I have limited experience in this field.<br />But from what I &quot;know&quot; Oxycontin was the king until they messed with the formula<br /><br />So, that leaves (from what I know): Fentynal, Oxycodone (Roxies), Percocet, Norcos<br />Where does Morphine fit on there? Or does it?...cause I have seen 2 types of morphine, crushable and controlled released. I&#039;m assuming the second one is not worth it, so...is the first ones that are crushable worth it? Are they the best pain killer out there?

				It&#039;s the best choice for IV/IM, They&#039;re all opiate drugs, and controlled release are designed to aid pain relief over a long period, but that&#039;s just what they&#039;re coated in, crush any and they&#039;re fast acting. Why is Heroin not on the list?

				Many opiates have a very high possibility for dependance, Morphine included. Fentynal is wild stuff.

				It depends if its for pain relief or abuse, what sort of pain are you in? <br /><br />As in the past I have been prescribed all sorts of meds, many do the trick but the negative side affects can sometimes leave you much worse of mentally. If the meds leave you with no appetite, sickness, constipation, itchiness, sweats and depression it can really out way the positives. <br /><br />It depends how serious your pain is to what you should be taking. People have suggested some pretty strong substances, where as weak pain you may only need paracetamol and neurophen mixed together 4 tablets at a time 8 times a day.. <br /><br />Obviously if the pain is much more serious then proper opiates or opiate derivatives maybe better but again long term the negatives may well out way the positives. <br /><br />To be honest a couple beers and dizapam take away much more pain than the standard dr giving you tramadol and codeine.. I really didn&#039;t think much of tramadol but I guess I have a high tolerance to things. <br /><br />Morphine sulphate capsules are a waste of time in my opinion, liquid morphine much better. IV morphine for maximum pain relief but again it just might not be worth it depending on your situation.

				Oh, not mentioned yet, what about Codeine? It can be pretty strong. Though like PR says, like the other opiates it carries some unwanted side effects.

				Yes.&nbsp; As a chronic pain patient, I can say without a doubt morphine is the best IV.&nbsp; Had it after each surgery. Dilaudid and&nbsp; Percocet work pretty damn good also, when IVs aren&#039;t available.&nbsp; As WingWong said, morphine is warm.&nbsp; Like a warm blanket.&nbsp;

				Thanks for letting me know.<br /><br />In your opinions, what is the best morphine (pill-wise) and also other types of morphine are the best to purchase on SR?<br />Also, do you have any vendors that you would recommend?

				This is just my outlook on the matter......Morphine has always made me feel like my head is being pulled down to my knees the whole time, giving me this really intense rush in my head, which I do not mind, but I have always like the effects, of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride otherwise known as Dilaudid....THAT is the cadillac of opiates if you ask me. Its different for everyone though and respectively the way you like to take it.

				Why does nobody sell codeine on SR? i searched for it a while ago and couldn&#039;t find anything worth while.. I was looking for close to home sellers tho so maybe missed some im in the UK well most of the time, but get to experience doing orders in the USA as well.<br /><br />If anyone can find me some codeine i&#039;d buy some, or is it not worth it? I know you must do a cold water extraction to rid it of paracetamol as its always co-codamol as far as im aware... <br /><br />Everything that goes up must come down, opiates are a tricky balance of this and if taken to often the balance soon becomes an addiction problem. You can dabble in everything but opiates are something I would be more careful with than any other substance.<br /><br />Post 50 for me! I&#039;m now a certified forumer haha

Whether it be Oxy of Hydro is simply how it crosses the cells membrane. That being a hydrogen molecule or oxygen. Now the effectiveness depends on each individuals body chemistry. Some have a higher affinity for the Oxy and others For the Hydro. I won&#039;t bore with needless details. Point is, codeine is derived from from the same Thebian(sp?) plant and can be converted to some very powerful narcs..&nbsp;

				From my experience and a bit of research to boot I&#039;d say Dilaudid is more potent (active at lower doses as well) when compared to morphine. Morph definitely still slaps the shit out you though. My advice is this, if you&#039;re trying to get fucked up on opiates, save your coin and don&#039;t fuck around with norcos or percs. Stick to morphine, oxies, and dillies ;)
