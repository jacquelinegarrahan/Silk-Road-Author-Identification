				It would be better if moderators were to approve people after about 20 posts. It wouldnt take them long to recognize quality posts (they are usually longer) and 20 quality posts<br />are more than the shithole we are now. Why can&#039;t I just add a successful delivery on SR as a post?

				Ya it sucks when you are new. You try to get the posts into areas that are relevant, but, then you realize that I cannot do this. So now my post has to go into the list of spam posts in the newbie section that noone will likely see. But hey, I guess it takes longer and is a harder process to become an established forum member this way. It hurts the newbs though.

				From my experience so far, within the deep web there are many people that are willing to spend a lot of time and effort to fuck with people or scam them. And with the popularity of SR on the rise I expect it to get even worst. Hopefully, they can make a new thread at some point that only newbies under 50 posts can post in and only full members can respond to and the original poster. Then they could move up to the newbie discussion or post in any other location at that point.<br /><br />My idea may be flawed. What do you think?
