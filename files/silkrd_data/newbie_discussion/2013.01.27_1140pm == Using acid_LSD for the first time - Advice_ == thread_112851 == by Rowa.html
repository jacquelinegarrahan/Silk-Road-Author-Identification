				I&#039;ll try to answer this, but remember, when it comes to things like this, everything is subjective.&nbsp; The best thing to do is to go into it with no expectations at all.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is acid a good psychedelic to start on?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My opinion? Yes.&nbsp; Clean LSD is usually very easy to manage and at reasonably low doses doesn&#039;t invade your whole headspace.&nbsp; Basically, I find it easy to &quot;turn off&quot; the trip a bit as long as I&#039;m not tripping too hard.&nbsp; This is a lot harder for me on things like mushrooms or 2C-I, which usually make focusing on anything else hard.&nbsp; LSD is also a very mindful drug, with little physical effects so long as the product is clean.&nbsp; Other psychedelics usually come with some negative physical aspects.&nbsp; Mushrooms can be hard on your stomach, RC&#039;s can leave you feeling drained, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never noticed any real discomfort on clean LSD.&nbsp; I would recommend it as a good starter psychedelic so long as you get it from a trusted vendor and put yourself in a good environment.&nbsp; Starting slow helps too.&nbsp; There will no doubt be people who disagree with this, this is just my opinion.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What sort of dosage am I best starting with considering I have never used psychedelics before?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I would start small, and work your way up.&nbsp; Check out the Avengers LSD thread and try to find a vendor that sells hits around 60-80ug.&nbsp; Don&#039;t bother with that expensive 100+ug stuff just yet.&nbsp; Buy 5 hits, take 1, see how it goes.&nbsp; If you like it, wait a week (or two) and take two.&nbsp; If you still like it, you know you can handle a pretty average dose.&nbsp; This will be a good judge of how well you can handle the whole thing.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How long can I expect a high to last? I have heard that acid can be unpredictable and vary a lot.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You should have noticeable effects anywhere from 6-12 hours.&nbsp; 12 hours being on the very high end of the scale, as that&#039;s not typical of doses anywhere under 200+ug.&nbsp; On 1-3 hits of average blotter, expect to notice first effects about 30 minutes in.&nbsp; You&#039;ll come up for about 2 hours, peak from 2-4 more, then come down for 2-4 more.&nbsp; The whole thing usually comes out around 8 hours from first effects til you&#039;re pretty much back to normal.&nbsp; What you&#039;ve heard is somewhat correct, as with all drugs, it will vary.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How many days should I have clear to follow up my acid trip? I have seen people saying they would not use acid without a completely clear 48+ hours ahead on consuming the drug.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>On low doses (60-150ug), you should feel just fine within 24 hours.&nbsp; You may feel a tad off base the next day, but there&#039;s certainly no hangover or nasty after-effects that would hinder you.&nbsp; That said, don&#039;t trip if you have to work the next day.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not good practice.&nbsp; 48 hours is a little far, I&#039;d say you&#039;re safe as long as you&#039;ve got the next day free.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually fine the next morning as long as I don&#039;t mix drugs too much and don&#039;t forget to eat and drink water.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fun things to do during trip?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This will be different every time, but here&#039;s some things I like to do.<br /><br />Music (listen to it or make it, or listen to someone make it)<br />Play with pets (hilarious, mindblowing)<br />Walk/Ride bikes if I&#039;m not completely off my rocker (them trees, them fractals)<br />Video Games (Fun if you&#039;re tripping with friends (mario kart+rainbow road), can feel mundane alone)<br />Lay on my side and watch the carpet wiggle<br />Lay on my back and way the textured ceiling wiggle and the walls breathe<br />Sex (especially if they&#039;re tripping too)<br />Contemplate the entire universe and how unfathomably tiny you are<br />Smoke weed<br /><br />That&#039;s just a tiny list.&nbsp; Don&#039;t try too hard to &quot;plan out&quot; your trip.&nbsp; Set a good vibe and let it ride.&nbsp; LSD will usually take you where you need to go.<br /><br />Good luck. This is one of my favorite drugs in the world, and I think anyone (who isn&#039;t predisposed for schizophrenia) should try it at some point.<br />Just remember; whatever you&#039;re expecting it to be like, it&#039;s probably not going to be like that.

				My take on this is very similar to everyone else&#039;s. As for time to be cleared after a trip, I agree with dabork. As long as you have the whole day after your tripping day clear, I think you should be fine. I&#039;ve worked the day following a trip before, but that was after several experiences. For a first time, I would definitely want the following day free to mull over the crazy awesome thoughts I thought earlier as well as to smoke some ganja and relax.<br /><br />That being said, here are some of my personal recommendations:<br /><br />1) Personally, I like tripping with a small group of friends. I usually trip with my girlfriend and one or two very close friends (obviously people who I would trust to be on drugs with).<br />2) I love, love, love tripping outside during the day. Walks, bike rides, sometimes swimming are all very awesome things to do whilst tripping. I like tripping during the daytime because I feel a lot of the visuals get wasted at night when you can&#039;t see as clearly.<br />3) Some music suggestions: Grateful Dead and Beatles are a no brainer, if you&#039;re into EDM some awesome people are Tycho, Emancipator, Govinda. I&#039;ve got tons more if you&#039;re interested man.<br />4) Have fun! LSD has been a life changing experience for me several times. Just make sure you&#039;re having a good time and everything else will fall right into place :)

You&#039;ll know that no matter how much you take, you&#039;ll come through the other side intact. So if there&#039;s ever a moment where you start thinking &quot;I think I&#039;ve taken too much... am I gonna be ok?&quot; you can answer that with an utterly unequivocal &quot;yes&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112851.msg769111#msg769111">Quote from: Rowa on January 27, 2013, 11:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What sort of dosage am I best starting with considering I have never used psychedelics before?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You seem enthusiastic and excited about trying this. You&#039;ve researched a bit, and are obviously ready and eager. I&#039;d say go for at least 150ug... make your first trip a fun one. :D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112851.msg769111#msg769111">Quote from: Rowa on January 27, 2013, 11:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How long can I expect a high to last? I have heard that acid can be unpredictable and vary a lot.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />About four hours with the peak effects, where you&#039;ll want to explore and see everything it&#039;s capable of. Though you won&#039;t return to fully normal for about 8 or 9 - the last few hours will gradually taper off back to normal.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112851.msg769111#msg769111">Quote from: Rowa on January 27, 2013, 11:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How many days should I have clear to follow up my acid trip?

Pick a day to trip, and spend the next day enjoying and savouring and reflecting on the afterglow. One thing you don&#039;t want to be is rushed, or have thoughts like &quot;I&#039;ve got work next day, am I gonna be ok for it?&quot; intruding on your trip. Also good if you can arrange not to be disturbed by everyday intrusions - you really don&#039;t want a phone call from your parents, or work, or an emergency to crop up that you have to deal with.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112851.msg769111#msg769111">Quote from: Rowa on January 27, 2013, 11:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fun things to do during trip?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Look at things. Listen to things. Think about things.<br /><br />Oh, more specifically? ;D<br /><br />Listen to music. You&#039;ll hear so much more detail, and it will sound much much better. So a chance to hear just how good all your favourites can truly sound.<br /><br />Look at things. Trees, clouds, granite, brickwork, raindrops on a windowpane, rugs, wallpaper, ceilings, wood grain on your doors, fabrics, artwork, movies. Detailed artwork can look especially good (Google image search Android Jones for examples!). Probably have to spend a few moments your first time just staring, to let your brain contemplate and form patterns and stuff, but when you see what happens you&#039;ll be amazed :)<br /><br />Think about things. Hard to describe, but it seems acid makes thinking about philosophical topics much easier (or at least, tricks you into thinking so... which is another thing to think about).<br /><br />So... have fun, let us know how it goes! ;D
