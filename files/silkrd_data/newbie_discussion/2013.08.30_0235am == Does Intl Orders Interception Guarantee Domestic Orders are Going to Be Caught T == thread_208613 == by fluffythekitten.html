				I ask coz i had some intl orders that I thought got intercepted really early on in my use of SR and since then only ever order domestically, all of which have gotten thru just fine. <br />I am wondering if those intl orders were ever really sent and were either just scams, were never sent and one (that was actually cancelled by the vendor after a few months), and so&nbsp; therefore, my address might not be as hot for intl as I&#039;ve been thinking. <br />Does anyone conclusively know if your going to get your address flagged for closer inspection of local packages if something&#039;s been intercepted by customs in, say, The Netherlands, for example?<br />Do their customs and our customs communicate this info?<br />I live in a country where there&#039;s no mention made to you by the postal services if you&#039;ve had an interception by customs, by the way.

				In a word, no. Those orders could have been scams, it&#039;s easy to do on intl orders. Unless you were bringing in large amounts, they are not going to bother flagging your address and keeping track of your every move. Even if they were going to go after you, they would have done so by now.
