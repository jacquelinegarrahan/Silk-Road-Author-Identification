				DMT is the strongest psychedelic on the planet. It is not something to be taken lightly. It is also not a &quot;party&quot; drug.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much research you&#039;ve done on DMT, but if you haven&#039;t done a significant amount of research on the subject, I would hold off on using the chemical until you have. DMT is actually produced in the human brain by the pineal gland. It is responsible for dreaming. There are a lot of substances out there, plants mainly, that contain compounds that are very close to pure DMT, but not as strong as smoking it. I would highly recommend working your way up the psychedelic ladder before jumping into the deep end of the pool. Things like psilocybin, ayahuasca, even edible cannabis are great ways to work your way up. Not only will your experience with smoking DMT be much more comfortable if you work your way up to it, you will gain a lot more insight and knowledge from it. Regardless of what you decide to do, make sure you take it seriously. Spend a few hours preparing your mind for what your about to do. Set an intent for why your doing it. Like I said this is not a party drug, so if your doing it to &quot;get crunked&quot; your setting yourself up for a terrible experience. I would suggest having someone there to sit with you who is not also doing the DMT. Be in a comfortable environment that is quiet and peaceful. The last thing I would say on the subject is this.. Don&#039;t fight it. If you try to fight the experience you&#039;re going to have what is referred to as a &quot;bad trip&quot;. You have to continually tell yourself to just let go and allow it to happen.

				I hate to say this but go big or go home, I&#039;d recommend 50mg in hopes of blasting off your first time. It&#039;s what DMT is all about. <br /><br />Enjoy your experience, I bought DMT from elvis a while back and it blew my mind. Humbling is an understatement.

				DO NOT put the flame directly on the DMT itself... Put the flame close enough to bend the flame when you inhale... Only want to get it really hot, so it vaporizes...
