				Ordered from a guy called CashMachine a few days ago who boasted 5 hour dispatches (I should&#039;ve smelled bullshit right there). Because I was in a hurry I didn&#039;t check the forums first which are mostly bad reviews, but almost all the reviews on his vendor page were 5/5 so I thought he would be trustworthy and his prices were too good to be true (another sign I ignored). It&#039;s been quite a few days now and he still hasn&#039;t sent it. I&#039;ve sent him some messages which he didn&#039;t reply to, but he has updated his page and added more listings. Since I ordered it seems like the guy has gone completely crazy, spouting on about masculinity instead of replying to customers and sending out packages.<br /><br />I can&#039;t cancel the order for a while yet. Other people in the forums have said they wanted to cancel their order but he marked as in transit just before it was possible. One review said it was marked in transit for 6 days but the stamp had yesterday&#039;s postage date so CashMachine keeps addresses after SR deletes them (against the rules) and posts them out when he feels like it. Is there any way to cancel earlier than the 4 days rule? I just want to get out of this with my money and reputation intact.<br /><br />Once it&#039;s &#039;in transit&#039; there&#039;s no way to cancel then, right? I&#039;m not sure if he will actually end up sending the order seeing as he is about to get a barrage of bad feedback anyway, he may as well just take the money and run. What are the chances of me getting my money back? I have decent stats and it seems he has a poor reputation on the forum but he&#039;s at 99% on SR so it could go either way if it goes to a resolve.<br /><br />Any advice or thoughts on the situation?

If it is marked &#039;in transit&#039; and you do not receive it within 10 days, take it to resolution; please see the SR Wiki here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Order_questions<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks Libertas, I had already read that, was just checking for other ways.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using SR for about a year (not the forums though until now) but I&#039;ve never had to go into resolution. What are the chances of me getting all my money back? He seems to be getting loads of complaints over the last few days so that&#039;ll play into my favour if it comes down to it, right?

If they are getting a lot of complaint in the last few days then yes, that will most likely work in your favour. I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t tell you what your chances are of getting all your money back though as I have no access to the information that the administrator will be looking at.<br /><br />Libertas
