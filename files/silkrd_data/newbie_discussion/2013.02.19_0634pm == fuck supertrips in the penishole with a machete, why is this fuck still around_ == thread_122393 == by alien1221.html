				Ive heard great things about him. I get his stuff on resale in usa. Whats your issue with him. He seems very legit. One of the top vendors the (1% to 99%) of the usa resales supertrips stuff. This vendor is great UGS. If UGS does business he must be legit. Whats this craziness about. did you not receive a package...It comes from far away? you have customs an all that shit.

				I had two orders from him. A 100x green pill pack and a reship. None of them arrived. Reship was 30 days after transit of the first package. Two different addresses to two different names.<br /><br />Communication was lengthy and always redirected to other costumer support within their group (but never came back with information ro my requested track n trace)<br /><br />My country, Denmark is on the boarder of Germany. There is no excuse the stuff shouldn&#039;t come. Denmark has the world&#039;s weakest customs ever. Like literally the worst. Politically, Denmark has come together and decided to become the transit country of narcotics from western and southern Europe to the Nordic countries. Denmark is in so much debt, they monthly fire costume officers to &#039;save&#039; government spending.<br />When was even the last time Denmark cracked down on a narcotics? The latest one was some cocaine hidden in Colombian banana crates already in driven Copenhagen, found by mistake by Coup employees. Found by MISTAKE...<br /><br />If i can get my drugs from the Netherlands in 3 days by standard mail and stealth, consistently, then why cant a German vendor do the same? It should be much easier, in fact, the odds are on his side.<br /><br />A lot of you think people are paid to talk bad about other vendors, but really, you wouldn&#039;t know the truth until you&#039;ve been involved with this type of issue coming him.<br /><br />I want to state that i have only had problems with this vendor. He is also my first vendor to buy from (hint: selective scammer)<br />This is just my story, but let this be a warning to the newbies. Purchase at your own risk.

				I&#039;m convinced that Germany has been catching packs shipped from Germany lately.&nbsp; If I had to guess, the DEA or maybe homeland security went to Germany and said &quot;stop this flow of drugs into our country.&nbsp; Here&#039;s some information to help you.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure the same was done with the Netherlands late last year.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m wrong but if I&#039;m right then I really regret that other countries don&#039;t tell the US to fuck off.
