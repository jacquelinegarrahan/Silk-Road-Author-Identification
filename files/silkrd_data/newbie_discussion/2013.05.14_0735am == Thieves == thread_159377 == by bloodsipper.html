				I dont want to mention any names as im not 100% sure its a scam yet, but i placed my first order ever on SR last week.&nbsp; My stupid ass didnt read anything, didnt even know the forums existed, just went off the positive feedback/transactions. I FE&#039;d as it was &#039;required&#039; (i had seen several other vendors have this in their posts and figured it was normal.&nbsp; 2 days after i placed my order a thread appeared about the vendor i had just purchased from accusing him of being a scammer.&nbsp; I was hoping for my package to arrive monday, it didnt.&nbsp; I am still hoping it arrives tomorrow and his name gets cleared and everyone else gets their product.&nbsp; moral of the story?&nbsp; DO NOT&nbsp; FE

				oh no. i hope it works out for you but its very possible you got scammed. FE is a tricky thing. It is great for getting money to a vendor that did a good job getting a product to you. but it also opens up scams.

				Sucks you had to learn that lesson the hard way.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t give up hope yet though.&nbsp; Theres plenty of reasons it could be delayed.&nbsp; Either way you&#039;ve learned the lesson about how valuable research is in successfully using SR.<br /><br />If I were you I would apply this to every aspect of the experience.&nbsp; Vendor reviews in the forums are much more informative than the results on SR and a vendor with active forum presence is generally better (as a trustworthy vendor and also for your piece of mind.)<br /><br />People talk a lot of shit.&nbsp; Always look for a second opinion and don&#039;t trust anyone with your own safety.

				+1 zetterberg, smart stuff, smart stuff<br /><br />I have only been scammed once out of 50+ positive transac&#039;s, and it was only for a gram of MDMA so i did not sweat it, but I did learn even though I thought I knew what a was doing pretty well, there were better ways of going about my business on SR as to not loose money
