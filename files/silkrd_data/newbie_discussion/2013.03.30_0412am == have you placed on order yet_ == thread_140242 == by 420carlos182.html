				or if you havent, like myself, do you already have a few orders in mind? i wanna place a few orders spread out at least a week apart. i plan on getting a gram of ketamine, molly, coke, and im definitely thinking some psychedelics. shrooms or some form, maybe p. galindoi (i think), it seems cheap and potent. i saw a 10g listing for 20 .5 caps and figured my roommate and i could split this as our first psychedelic experiences

				also i was eyeing some xanax powder because for 1000mgs the prices are unbelievable, but from personal experience and what ive heard.you only get something like 40% of the effect while snorting xanax. is this true? although even if it is at the price per weight and effectiveness ts still with it. how else would you dose it? parachuting? could you cap it and would it be like popping a bar?
