				Recently I have this sharp pain under my right chest when I take deep breaths. Only drugs&nbsp; I&#039;ve done so far is weed. I&#039;ve smoked it out of a bong and a vape. Weed couldn&#039;t be the cause of this can it? After some research it looks like it might either be Pleurisy or Gallbladder. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s not gallbladder because I don&#039;t have insurance. With Pleurisy Google says to just take ibuprofen for the pain and it should clear up on it&#039;s on. I&#039;ve taken some Advil but it hasn&#039;t helped much. Weed is supposed to be a pretty good pain killer. Do you think I&#039;m safe to smoke weed again?<br /><br />This is also horrible timing since I planned to take some adderall for the first time and catch up with some school work. But I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s probably best to wait for this pain to pass before taking adderall right?

				I&#039;ve had that happen before; it&#039;ll usually pass.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it has any connection to weed or your drug use.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually just an air pocket or cramps that are exacerbated by the movement of the ribcage/chest while breathing.&nbsp; I&#039;d say give it a day or two, if it&#039;s still happening then check out the doc.<br /><br />Good Luck

				This is common, it isn&#039;t a health problem (usually), and it&#039;s one of those unexplained medical mysteries (like what causes the sound when you crack your knuckles). The two most prevalent current theories are: a pinched nerve somewhere in your back or chest, or a gas bubble in your digestive system. In either case, it&#039;s nothing to worry about.

Weed may be a pain killer but it has also many other effects on your body. I wouldn&#039;t try it until you know a bit more on what&#039;s happening to you.
