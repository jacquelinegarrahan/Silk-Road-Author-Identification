				I think it really depends on the setting. LSD is a much more social drug and (in my opinion) is much better in social situations. On the other hand, I find mushrooms are better in a solitary setting where you can freely explore your thoughts and consciousness without being bothered. In addition, the duration of a mushroom trip (~6-7 hours) would probably be better for a newbie. An individual that isn&#039;t well versed in psychedelics can easily get overwhelmed in a 12-hour LSD trip.<br /><br />Have you considered 2C-B at all? That&#039;s a nice and easy trip with lots of visuals and not as much mind fuck as a conventional psychedelic. Kind of like dipping your feet in the water before jumping in.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t suggest you take DMT. I feel as though people underestimate that drug. It&#039;s a powerful, powerful hallucinogenic that you can easily get overwhelmed on.<br /><br />No matter what you should use a sitter. Hope my advice helped!

				Mescaline.<br />GammaGoblin has some up, and I think it&#039;s only $80/g<br />Not as headbending as shrooms, just as visual or more than LSD, gentle euphoria.<br />Take it with some ginger, and your stomach won&#039;t turn.&nbsp; Mushrooms can also be hard on the stomach.<br /><br />For a first time I highly recommend either it or LSD - as the dosages and effects are very predictable.<br />Mushrooms may not last as long, but can spin you right-out if you aren&#039;t prepared, and dosages can vary from mushroom to mushroom.<br /><br />@Swanney:&nbsp; I thought you were a vendor?&nbsp; Calling someone a fag is pretty childish to begin with, but to call someone that for being cautious with their drug intake is pretty unprofessional.<br /><br />Regardless of what anyone says to you here, including me, read about the drugs you want to take, and decide for yourself.&nbsp; You are the only one who really knows what is inside you, and what you are capable of.<br /><br />2CB can be pretty gentle, and is one of Shulgin&#039;s favourites.&nbsp; Check out erowid.org for info and trip reports on all these substances.&nbsp; I find trip reports fun to read, and they give you a good spread of what can happen with each drug, from good experiences to bad.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about addiction with hallucinogens - they almost all have a tolerance of a few days to a week (except DMT, which could be done daily) so you can&#039;t effectively become addicted due to the lack of frequency, and there is no chemical addiction associated.&nbsp; DMT is released into your brain naturally every night when you sleep.

				I too think LSD is easier to handle first, but do not expect a very visual experience on a low-low/intermediate dose. It&#039;s still a beautiful and highly recommended experience. <br /><br />The headiness:visuals ratio of a mushroom dose is much more 1:1, meaning that a small enough dose to get you thinking shroomy thoughts will also get you to experience visuals. I find that they stay pretty proportional that way to about 4 grams, the most I&#039;ve ever done and the most i&#039;ve tripped, mentally and visually, on shrooms. To compare, I&#039;ve had 2 hits of acid with a beautiful high but very little open eye visuals.
