				Hi all,<br /><br />I am new to SR and would like to purchase something. the vendor is asking me to pay to his bank account. Can I trust him? Please advise me<br />here is his email:<br /><br />&nbsp;Hello, XS!<br /><br />First of all thanks a lot for your request!<br /><br />What do you mean how can pay? With bitcoins or you can transfer money to my bank account. After I received your money I would transfer it to your SR account and after that you can purchase the DL.<br />

				Hmm it sounds like he&#039;s trying to sell you some bitcoins so you can purchase his items, what vendor is it? Do you already have bitcoins? I wouldn&#039;t reccomend sending money to anyones bank account, Go purchase some bitcoins from a reliable source on the clearnet and then come back and purchase things off silk road, and always stay in Escrow until you receive item.<br />Hope this helps<br />

				Never actually bought off that vendor, but he seems legit. Still i would reccomend getting your bitcoins elsewhere at first.<br />Escrow is the system that prevents a lot of scamming, it basically means that your money goes to a third party before it reaches the seller to ensure that they don&#039;t get the money until you finalize when you&#039;re item arrives.<br /><br />This make sense to you?<br /><br />Best regards<br /><br />Mr. Psych

				Since one of his suggestions is for you to pay him with bitcoins I assume it isn&#039;t bitcoins you are buying. Therefore you really shouldn&#039;t pay to his bank account, I don&#039;t know how the bitcoinvendors are doing their thing on SR so I wouldn&#039;t comment on that. <br />On his silkroad vendor profile *he has listings of products and you have the &quot;add to cart&quot; thing. When you use this to pay for your product it will stay in escrow. This means that the payment will not finalize until you have received your product and have finalized it manually or you have waited 17 days for your order to auto-finalize. You should avoid letting the order auto-finalize so if time is running up and you aren&#039;t receiving your package you should click the resolve option on the order to get more time so you can find out what is gong on.

				Thank you very much for your help.<br /><br />the problem is he has one listing with two products and two different prices. I cannot chose the correct product when I add to the chart. hence the price is also not accurate. I have requested him to make a new list so I can purchase it from the market.<br />I really appreciate your help, thank you very much.<br /><br />sculay.<br />
