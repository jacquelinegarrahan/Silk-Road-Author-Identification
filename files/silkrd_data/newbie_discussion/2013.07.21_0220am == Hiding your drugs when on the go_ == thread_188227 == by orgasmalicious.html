				I&#039;m just curious to know how everyone hides their stuff when they&#039;re out and about! Hiding things at my house isn&#039;t a problem but I always get nervous when i&#039;m going out. I have a locket type necklace that can hold a few pills or bumps so most of the time I use that and just bring a tiny spoon or straw with me for quick bumps but I hide things in my bra sometimes too. I&#039;m always looking for creative, discreet ways to hide my shit so if anyone has any interesting methods, I would love to hear! :)

				Generally use a pen lid for bumps and also don&#039;t have enough on me at once to be too worried about hiding it, so I just use my pockets or wallet.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do get worried sometimes though, but how creative (practically speaking) can you get?

				I wont be sharing all of my ideas with you but one i do think is creative is a product that has been on the market for some time. It is a women&#039;s bra that allows you to store fluids in it great for festivals where alcohol is over priced and half strength, also great for liquid fanta. <br /><br />&nbsp;Remember guys caution when posting ideas we are being watched!

				Oh wow, I never thought to try that and I have an Android! I think I need to test that out sometime. <br />Yeah, exactly, I feel like there&#039;s no really good place to hide things unless you&#039;re clever like with the makeup brushes.

I dont smoke but i do carry a lighter with me used for carrying my powder substances. Ive used just a normal colored lighter removed the top and emptied and hollowed out the inside of the chamber where the gas is held. It does take about 2 - 3 hours work to do but i have never been caught.&nbsp; &nbsp;
