				A package I&#039;ve sent to a friend was recently intercepted by UPS. I&#039;ve sent multiple packages of bud out before (1oz plus) without a hitch. However this time I opted for an overnight shipment of only an 1/8th vac sealed that never made it to the destination. I was sending it domestically within the states. After calling they confirmed it was held for inspection and given a case number. Unfortunately I made the mistake of giving them my phone number (happens to be linked to my parents address as I&#039;ve been shipping legal packages with UPS for years).<br /><br />I imagine packages are seized on a regular basis, and most are untraceable (fake names/return address). However they have my full name and address, how worried should I be? Do they have the time and resources to prosecute me for an eighth? will the package be thrown out and forgotten? What can I expect from the eighth being seized in Florida by UPS?

				First off, you should know that most people here say not to post specific locations when you&#039;re asking for advice like this. It&#039;s just better practice not to since if LE ever happened to come across this and link it to you it could be considered a confession. Also, not sure what you were thinking giving them your phone number or even calling from your house to ask about it. I don&#039;t know enough about this to really give a good answer but I hope you&#039;ll never make the mistake of doing that again.<br /><br />I would venture to guess that they probably won&#039;t come after you for such a small amount. Hopefully someone with more knowledge about this will reply.

				Thanks for the response and input, I definitely will be taking more precautions. I hope they do overlook it, however I won&#039;t put it past the long dick of the law to try and fuck me. I&#039;m hoping for someone who can tell me the standard procedure taken by UPS in instances such as this

				Another Question (and shameless bump): If they decide to followup and prosecute, do they send a letter in the mail? policemen at the door? a phone-call? A warrant for my arrest?

				Probably if they were to arrest you, they would come with a warrant to your door.<br /><br />But who knows.<br />

				Yeah, waiting might be good. Better hide everything nasty from your house, though!
