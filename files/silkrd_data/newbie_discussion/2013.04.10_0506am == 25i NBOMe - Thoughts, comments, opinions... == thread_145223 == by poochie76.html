				So I entered a lottery on the SR without thinking much of it and ended up winning 40 blotters of 25i NBOMe.<br /><br />That&#039;s a FUCKLOAD of blotters, esp when you consider that apparently you only need 1 and you can&#039;t redose within a fortnight.<br /><br />What&#039;s everyone&#039;s experience with this research chemical.&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit worried about exposing myself and my lady to this drug.&nbsp; Certainly not keen for an overdose.<br /><br />Thoughts, comments, opinions...?

				Dude don&#039;t worry. If you weigh less than 150 lbs, I wouldn&#039;t take more then 2mg MAX to start and only go up incrementally from there if you fell comfortable with it.<br />&nbsp;The stuff is fun, awesome visuals, good introspection.&nbsp; I find a lot of people shy away from it at first, but as soon as someone tosses a free one in their lap, and they give it a try, it&#039;s off to the races, it is a very nice mescaline like experience. Very up, stimulating, euphoric, giddy type of high with intense visuals. You will love it.

				Both times I have done it (unintentionally, mind you) was at a concert- realized it&#039;s so bitter it&#039;s burning my tongue, spat out one of the two hits and proceeded to have a great time. I think the real speed-boost it gives you makes it really conducive to an all-night activity. Considering how effective one was, my body would probably melt down with two. If you&#039;re using LSD as a baseline, the headtrip:visuals ratio is definitely skewed right, but that&#039;s not to say it isn&#039;t introspective. You seem like a responsible fellow with a head in the right place (by virtue of your caution and effort to be grammatical over the internetz)- take one, keep some water around and you&#039;ll both have a good time, I&#039;m sure.

I doubt I&#039;d go over 2000ug max.
