				I&#039;m a new buyer to the Silk Road. Been following it for quite a while, just been too paranoid to make any purchases. But I mean, if I&#039;m making a rather small purchase (for example, a couple adderall pills or something like that), am I pretty much safe from having cops come up to my door or having any such trouble with authorities? From what&#039;s been publicized on the web, those who have gotten into trouble from buying off the Silk Road have been pretty much buying in large ass bulks of the more extreme drugs out there in the eyes of these authorities. If I simply make an exchange via moneygram, western union, etc, would I be for the most part safe and good to go with it? With this being a first time purchase and a pretty small purchase that I don&#039;t think should draw much attention..

				Ok. The most dangerous part is the walk from the mailbox to the hour or so thereafter, IMO. There&#039;s practically no danger of your btc being tracked and there&#039;s practically no danger of this site being compromised and your information leaked. USE PGP AND USE YOUR REAL NAME AND ADDRESS. I cannot stress those two more. The PGP for the fact that IF the site is ever compromised, it&#039;s one more level of encryption and the real name and address because it will blend it fine with your other mail.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know of what busts you&#039;re citing and don&#039;t know what country you&#039;re from but here in the US the only one I can remember was a street dealer who was also dealing on SR. He wasn&#039;t caught BECAUSE of SR but he was caught after his arrest for street dealing.<br /><br />Don&#039;t write down the URL anywhere. Keep it memorized. <br /><br />And finally, the quantities you&#039;re talking about shouldn&#039;t be enough to get anyone too worried. *Knock on wood* as I&#039;m expecting a small pill delivery in the morning lol. Don&#039;t sign for packages. As I and plenty others have said, take a ~$100 loss over going to jail. If you do get pinched, don&#039;t say anything *ANYTHING* to someone that isn&#039;t your lawyer. Don&#039;t deny, don&#039;t admit. Don&#039;t say anything. <br /><br />Hope that helped. If it didn&#039;t, what other questions do you have?

				This all boils down to risk assessment. With there being inherent risky in varying facets on SR, one needs to be preemptive and consider all angles. I feel you have the general idea down: by ordering in small amounts you are effectively reducing the risks you take from having contraband shipped to you. Yet, there are many ways to reduce risk. Ways that would make even buying in bulk less risky by some increment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just assess the risks and strategies utilized by many on here to reduce those risks and you will do fine. I see it as getting busted- or more commonly for buyers, loosing your order in the mail -is like winning a shitty lottery; luck goes both ways but here you can manipulate your odds.

I think it&#039;s safer than street dealing myself and since I am going to do drugs, I look for the safest way to do so.<br /><br />You have the information. You have the way. You have the will. Now it&#039;s up to you to decide to put it all together and buy or keep street buying...<br /><br />Final thought: I don&#039;t think there has been anyone that hasn&#039;t been excited and crazy nervous their first time around. I was worried the entire 48 hours the item was in transit. Luckily, the first vendor I ever dealt with (caligirl) was super professional and made something super illegal into a pleasurable experience. Don&#039;t go with new vendors your first time. Find someone who has been around and has shipped literally hundreds of packages of drugs around the country and world. They are the best at what they do and there&#039;s virtually no reason to not trust them.

				Some, more paranoid people may disagree with me but I don&#039;t worry too much about the bitcoin part. People swear by local bitcoins so give it a try:) I use virwox myself which accepts paypal and CC. I don&#039;t worry because I send this to a tumbling service which mixes your bitcoins from several sources and deposits different amounts totalling your orignal amount to obscure the deposit and final desitination locations. This makes it almost impossible for anyone to see where my bitcoins went. And even if they did, it&#039;s not illegal to use Silk Road or deposit money into their system. After all this, Silk Road has a built in tumbler which launders your money 7 times I believe. But yeah, if you want total 100% privacy which is totally understandable, try using localbitcoin. <br /><br />I hope I don&#039;t sound negligent but I think there are more important security features that could link you or me to drugs than bitcoins. The mailing is 90% of the danger in my eyes and as long as that&#039;s not compromised, everything will be fine.

				Most buyers know how to ship things. Otherwise they don&#039;t last very long. With that being said, if you want to best your chances of never getting caught, don&#039;t order from overseas.<br /><br />99% of SR arrests are packages caught in customs.&nbsp;

				Sent and received over 1000 packages in my life over about 8 years, never once have I gotten a letter from customs, even if they take a few days to process my order, and I have never had any issues in the UK &gt; UK post, but international orders can be delayed by customs for a couple of weeks, but always arrive, usually without even being opened.

				Take proper security precautions, deal with respected vendors, buy domestic and when your comfortable step it up from there.<br /><br />Arrests are well publicized but the thousands who don&#039;t get caught get very little press (by choice).<br /><br />Buying a key of coke from Sth America with your first buy isn&#039;t wise. Get comfortable with everything and progress from there.

				Buy from vendors who have been around awhile and have their stealth together. You will figure out who these vendors are by looking at their vendor pages and seeing how many transactions they&#039;ve done and reading feedback. Also, research your vendors on these forums. I think your safer buying off the Road than on the street.

I buy tons of crap on the internet, from gadgets to clothes to computers to dietary supplements (the legal kind). And sometimes without asking some companies send me a new customer card, discount member card or whatever that occasionally needs signing. Hell I&#039;m not going to review every bloody package before I accept it, I blindly sign for any package when needed as long as the van from the package guy is in sight. Actually, it would annoy the package delivery guy if I really DID review every package I got. He just puts the signing thing right into my face after I&#039;ve opened the door.<br /><br />Beware when you see no van - there are some scams involving fake mail/package delivery guys, usually saying you need to pay some bucks before you can have the package - the package is just a brick in a box with bogus sender address. Needless to say you don&#039;t want these guys to have your signature either.

				And also, if you HAVE to buy bulk packages (already massively increasing the risk), get them shipped separately into smaller orders, rough example, you&#039;re not likely to be fucked for getting an ounce of ket in the mail (depending on location), they have bigger things to worry about generally unless you get some dicks, but a 250g package is a different matter. though 90% of times your package gets caught you&#039;ll just get a love letter from customs, i know people who have had this with 5k valium and one guy who got it with a 100g ket order, lucky sod (for not getting a CD anyways, he still lost 100gof ket). When you get that letter, leave it be and accept your losses.<br /><br />Also with parcels of serious drugs, its also a good idea to right return to sender on the back and dont open it for a day or 2, this gives you a degree of deniability, i mean its not your fault if someone sent you drugs, you know nothing about it, the package looked odd so you were going to return it. No proof to the contrary unless you leave such proof lying around or saved on your pc etc.<br /><br />Be safe guys, that is just from my experience, may go into more details later if anyone wants

In the UK luckily we have a nice cheap selection locally, and can get most domestic on SR, and i&#039;ve never heard of a UK &gt; UK package being intercepted out of 1000s of orders, god bless royal mail (except when they&#039;re being slow bastards).<br /><br />Also i&#039;ve never had a package go missing from UK &gt; USA, or UK &gt; EU. <br />When ordering abroad use your head about which country you&#039;re ordering from, pakistan is generally a no no (more comes down to pot luck), india columbia etc will all be much more closely scrutinized than orders from EU countries etc, make sure the vendor has a great feedback reviews commenting on their stealthy packaging and that before thinking about ordering

				Rather than create a new thread I figured I&#039;d jump on this one since I&#039;m in the same boat. I&#039;m just waiting on my coins, but it will be a domestic US shipment, and from what I read so far this is one of the safer combinations. Is that correct? One thing I am curious about is just what exactly is considered a &quot;small&quot; amount (of say weed)? I was thinking of doing an oz so that I don&#039;t have to order as often...is that risky? Thanks in advance for any advice.

				I agree with most everything people have said.I just wanted to add that the fact that they send out letters for most larger amounts instead of knocking down your door should suggest,they don&#039;t have near the man power to deal with all the confiscations.Of course if I ever got a letter,I would never have anything shipped to that addy again.On the other hand I heard a story from someone I trust that a guy had the swat team at his door for ordering a few vials from PK.But ordering from pakistan is a whole other story.

				If youre dealing with schedule II or schedule III stuff, in a lot of states they dont even want to waste their time with it.&nbsp; Certain states prisons are too overcrowded that they cant waste time and money with nonviolent drug offenses especially when they arent even schedule I.&nbsp; Then if they do decide to try to bust you, theres the question of if youre a repeat offender or first timer, do you have a college degree or not, do you have a job or own a business.&nbsp; The less you fit the profile of a violent gang member, the more likely you will get a slap on the wrist if anything ever goes sour.

				I&#039;ve never had any problems, with something like 100 orders. Probably more. I exclusively use heroin, so I know I&#039;m getting the shit that the LEO community wants to catch, but if you stick with good vendors the stealth is good. Period.<br /><br />There have been a couple of times where I really had to search the package to find my stuff. <br />There have also been a couple of times where it was a bag inside of a letter in a envelope, and yeah it was vacuum sealed, but I didn&#039;t order form those ppl again.<br /><br />I only order from domestic, this is both paranoia and impatience, I mostly get #4 powder and most of what I get comes form just a couple states away so it&#039;s fast.
