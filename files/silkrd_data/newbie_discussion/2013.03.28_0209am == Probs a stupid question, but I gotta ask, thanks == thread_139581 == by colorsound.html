				Hi<br /><br />I went on google and did a normal search in my tor browser, is that ok?<br /><br />I ask because I saw a link to a site that lets you search surface web in tor, and this made me think I had somehow &#039;unmasked&#039; myself.<br /><br />Thanks

				It&#039;s better to use separate browser for TOR, because &quot;browser fingerprinting&quot; decreases anonymity.

				It&#039;s probably best to avoid google where possible. For starters, they will often blank refuse to run a search for you when you are on TOR. Other times they will make you type captchas. Google wants to know who you are and store as much information about you as possible, that&#039;s probably part of the reason they are quite anti-tor. Even if they don&#039;t know who you are, they will store everything you give them. I would definitely switch tor identity before accessing google.<br /><br />Having said that, just because you can see one of those onion.to websites that shows deep web on the clearnet, doesn&#039;t mean you are unmasked in any way.<br /><br />You could try DuckDuckGo or some other hidden service search engine.

				There are articles about the Onion Router (OR) protocol, some of them academic papers. You should spend a few hours learning about TOR.... beyond just using it.<br /><br />One such article by the following authors: Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson, Paul Syverson; &quot;Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router&quot;

				Hi and thanks for the tips.<br />I did try reading about tor and watching a video, but they lost me, because of all the technical jargon.<br /><br />When I looked something up on google while in tor I did have to do some of those capataha things.<br />If I switch identity, will I have to set up as a new user on these forums?<br /><br />Many thanks

				Keep reading. The answers are throughout the forum.<br /><br />Are you using Liberte/Tails? Dynamic DNS? Tor routing puts you in an &quot;internet cloud&quot; where you, along with thousands of others, all appear to have the same IP address: that of the exit node. Google and CLEARNET can reveal your position... generally... down to state, then city.... but you&#039;re still hidden as long as you don&#039;t google your area code for weather... shit like that.<br /><br />Switch to a different ISP... physical location. I just go from coffee shop to coffee shop all day. : )
