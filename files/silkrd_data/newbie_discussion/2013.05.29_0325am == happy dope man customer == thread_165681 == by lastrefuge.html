				Purchased some lsd from dope man. No extra fees just because I was new, shipped very fast and packaged like it came from big pharma. Happy in all respects. i also bugged him quite a bit as it was one of my 1st purchases and he put up with me with no problems. I will be making more purchases from him in the very near future........<br />Since i am not wasting my time posting crap to get my post count up, figured I would leave this here so maybe others could see my experience dealing with him. What is it, 40 posts, so only 38 more purchases to go and i can actually post in the vendor&#039;s section. Doesn&#039;t make sense to me since u can just post anything to get your number up. Too much a waste of time as my Tor browser doesn&#039;t blaze along like my regular one.<br />

				Thanks for the post.&nbsp; Dope Man was selling opium only a few days ago and I was very interested, but since I didn&#039;t know anything about him I was reluctant to order.&nbsp; Next time his opium goes back up I&#039;ll try to nab it.
