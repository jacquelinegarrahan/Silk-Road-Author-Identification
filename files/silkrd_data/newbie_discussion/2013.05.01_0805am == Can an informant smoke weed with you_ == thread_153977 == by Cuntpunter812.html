				If you are dealing Weed to somebody and you smoke with them and are weighing there product and are getting a bad feeling about them.<br />DO NOT SELL TO THEM ANYMORE, only deal with people you know and trust. Being a dealer you got to be inconspicuous.

				Yeah, I agree. I&#039;d only smoke with them if they&#039;re repeat and trusted customers. People you don&#039;t know, NEVER. <br />Furthermore, cops are in general not interested in small time drug dealers unless they are trying to get up the chain. So unless you&#039;re a big fish ... which you aren&#039;t cuz a big fish would never do such things and would be smarter :p

				EXACTLY! What Vyle said. Stick to your personal friends &amp; older folk who have real jobs ( they&#039;ll be your main buyers) who cant find any other connectiosn because they are old..<br /><br />Then as time passes your close friends will link you up with other trust worthy people.<br /><br />Remember! The fewer the transactions the better. Which is why it&#039;s in a way safer to deal in bulk amounts.. because you get your money in one quick go and you usually only need a couple big buyers to make good cash.<br /><br />but to answer your question INFORMANTS CAN SMOKE WEED, COPS CANNOT... Remember cops use people they arrest to bust other&#039;s! those people they bust are obvious drug users soo yeah there you have it! <br /><br />Stay secret, stay safe. Try to stay away from bringing large traffic to your place of residence.. If you&#039;re dealing with only friends you wont have to worry about this. Pce, and safe journeys!&nbsp;

				get your buyers to take ur loaded gun and have your best friend kneel down execution style and see if they shoot ur friend dead.. if they dont kill ur buddy they are most likely a cop.. dont sell them even half a gram if they are not willing to blow ur friends head off.. you might be fined for a misdemeanour in the us if you sell them small amounts<br /><br />does take a toll on ur social life though.. i dont have any friends anymore

Almost never people came to my house directly to buy weed; it was always just in the neighborhood when I was hanging out with friends, until a 40-50 year old guy just stood at my door without even calling and I never met this guy before. In the end nothing was wrong with him, but back then I surely found this highly suspicious. Hell, I was 14 years old and my mom opened the door and there&#039;s an old man, whom she never seen before, standing there asking for me ( this is highly unusual where I live :D )

				The best advice you could get has already been given to you - stick to selling to people you know. If someone you know has a friend that wants some of your goods, then insist on dealing with the person you actually know, at least until such times as you form an acquaintance with the friend of a friend. <br /><br />I sell bud only to people I know, and I know a lot of potheads. Yet, not one of them would describe me as a dealer. As far as any of them are concerned I&#039;m just a toker that can get them some. And that is exactly how I like it.<br /><br />Its the same for me when I buy smoke face to face. I prefer to know the person I&#039;m buying from. Last time I bought some smoke from a friend of a friend, I called at his door in a shithole of a housing estate, it took him 2 good minutes to unbarricade the door and once I got in, couldn&#039;t help but notice the selection of weapons in case of unwanted visitors. This is no way to live.<br /><br />And its not the feds I&#039;m worried about. Its the criminal gangs that operate around here who like to think they control all the drugs being sold. They don&#039;t, but I like to make sure there is daylight between myself and the gangs. The po-leece and the courts would be infinitely more kind to me that the balloon heads who flood the city with shit weed for premium prices.&nbsp; The only thing worse than a dickhead is a dickhead with a gun&nbsp; :o

				Informants can be people who are facing jail time unless they turn other people in. This is to reduce their own sentence as part of a plea deal. The result is a race to entrap an acquaintance, so a semi-regular buyer could turn into an informant even if they originally were legit. Don&#039;t underestimate the disgusting tactics of informants via the feds.
