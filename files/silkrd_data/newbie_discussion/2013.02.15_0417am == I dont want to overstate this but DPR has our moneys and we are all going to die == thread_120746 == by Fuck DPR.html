				I nearly lost my shit when I saw 281 btc show up in my account.&nbsp; I thought for sure someone was trying to set me up to make a big buy and then bust me for it.&nbsp; Then I got the &quot;maintenance&quot; message, and thought &quot;god damn, I should&#039;ve transferred those btc out of my account&quot;.&nbsp; Then I realized I&#039;m a good guy, and could never live with myself knowing I ganked someone for $7G&#039;s US.&nbsp; I&#039;m just glad it was just a glitch, and not a DEA agent trying to fuck me up the ass sans lube.&nbsp; In any case, I did place an order today that was supposed to be sent express so as to get here by Saturday at the latest, but thats likely not going to happen.&nbsp; Oh well...as long as I get it, I&#039;m good.&nbsp; Paying for express when it won&#039;t get here when I wanted it to sucks, but things could be worse...I could be set up by the DEA to buy 7G&#039;s worth of dope to send to my girls house!

				This seems to be a shitty enough thread for my first post. <br />&quot;Fuck DPR&quot; You seem to be a little bit paranoid. Maybe you shouldn&#039;t eat that much sativa in one go?<br />I&#039;d suggest a valium, but since DPR has apparently stolen all of your BTC, maybe you can&#039;t afford it.

				We ARE all going to die but it&#039;s not DPR&#039;s fault. Also he only &#039;has&#039; anyone&#039;s money if they leave it in their wallet on SR. I leave mine in an Instawallet until I&#039;m ready to use it.
