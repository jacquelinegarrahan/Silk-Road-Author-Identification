				<br />I was wondering what was the best was to check out the purity of some of the SR products. It is so easy to have a vendor sell bunk on here. Especially if you are a noob.<br /><br />I have a few &quot;types&quot; of SR products that I know enough about to tell if it is total bunk or not. But there are plenty that I do not. How does one go about testing purity? Is there a kit or something?<br /><br />Just trying to help out the noob&#039;s and myself of course.&nbsp; ;)

				What are you trying to test? <br /><br />Dancesafe has MDMA test kits that you order in the US. EZTest also has kits for MDMA, cocaine, ketamine and LSD. They ship from the EU.<br /><br />You can also send your stuff to the lab used by escasydata.&nbsp; They post all their results here: http://www.ecstasydata.org/ <br /><br />As you can see, people use it for testing everything, not just MDMA. It costs $40 per pressed pill or $140 for any other sample. If you look through the results, you will see some references to samples obtained from vendors on SR.

				I use EZ Test kits. Order from eztest.com. I get mine in about 5 days, Netherlands to US. Excellent kits that I use for every buy I make so I can be sure about what I&#039;m putting in my body. If I get bunk then I don&#039;t use it and I eat the loss of my coin and I post appropriate feedback to the vendor. I bought 5 cocaine purity kits and 5 cocaine cuts kits (10 tests in each kit) and it cost me $159 including shipping. Well worth the money and as someone else said they have kits for almost every drug imaginable.

				I was looking at EZTEST products but I did not see a option for US currency. Does anyone know of a place I can get them in the US?

				@NewGuy<br /><br />I ordered from them.&nbsp; using mc or visa, place the order for the amount, it will show the price in euros, but your cc statement will have the adjusted price for the current exchange rate of eu&gt;usd.&nbsp; it takes about 8-14 working days to arrive, so expect that, but otherwise, well worth the money.<br />hope this helps,<br />mmr
