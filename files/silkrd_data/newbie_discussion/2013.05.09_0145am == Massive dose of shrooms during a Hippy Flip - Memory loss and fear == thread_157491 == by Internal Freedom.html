				Hey guys, so a while back I finished harvesting some Thai Cubensis shrooms that I had been growing. The first time I took them I ate 50g fresh (To what I understood was around 5g dry), and had an incredibly visual trip. I smoked an entire face blunt during the experience and got very woozy after that, unfortunately after about 4 hours through the trip I started losing feeling in my face. A friend of mine said my entire jaw was turning purply-blue and I couldn&#039;t feel or move any facial muscles below my eyes. This was slightly alarming but it went away as the trip came to a stop and I felt fine the next day.<br /><br />A few weeks later I decided to attempt my first hippy flip with my shrooms and some fairly good quality molly I had from a local guy. I had taken the same molly and shrooms before, each on their own. I took 125mg of MDMA and waited until it kicked in. After about 30-45 minutes of effects, I lemon tekked around 8-9g of dry shrooms (Yes im aware this is a huge amount), I let them sit in the juice for about 20-30 minutes and almost yakked trying to get down the chunky, bitter, lemony concoction. After around an hour my pupils dialated severely, to the point where most of the white around my eyes was no longer there. Its the biggest I ever saw my pupils to be completely honest. After another half en hour, I started getting extremely scrambled thoughts and I couldnt think about the same thing for more then 2 seconds without me forgetting what I was thinking or changing to a new subject. At one point I literally sat up and walked half way down my upstairs hall, and stood there for 15 minutes while I tried to remember what I walked there for.<br /><br />After an hour or so of my extremely scrambled thought process, I realized that this was no longer enjoyable and I went to lay down. I sat in the dark in my room watching patterns on my pitch-black ceiling spiral all over the place as random colors followed them. I couldn&#039;t enjoy most of the trip because of how messed up I felt, I couldn&#039;t focus or concentrate on anything for more then a few seconds and I was constantly forgetting what I was doing or thinking about. I also again lost feeling in my face and tried to understand why that was happening. I tried remembering my own name at some point but even that wasn&#039;t very clear. Somehow, I drifted off to sleep and woke up around 3:30am (Roughly 7-8 hours after I took the shrooms). My memory had been completely wiped. I didn&#039;t remember anything at all. I didn&#039;t know where I was, who I was, or why I was here. I sat in the pitch black room for another 45 minutes, constantly confusing myself and trying to think of what happened before I drifted off back to sleep.<br /><br />I woke up the next morning feeling slightly dazed but relatively back to normal. I considered it to be a &quot;bad trip&quot;. It was the first bad trip I had ever had in my dozens of shroom, lsd and DMT experiences and really made me wonder about mixing substances together. I still have an ounce of these shrooms left and I really don&#039;t think I should be taking them, the whole facial thing is very strange.
