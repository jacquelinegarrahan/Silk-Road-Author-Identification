				Ask the vendor whether he will agree or if he will adjust his weight and make you a custom order.<br /><br />Sometimes being short is not about begging - it&#039;s simply a hassle to load up $9 of BTC or purchase them.

				dude, message the vendor. Almost EVERY single vendor i&#039;ve asked. (6 out of 6) they&#039;ve offered to reduce weight and or just wave however much you&#039;re short and create a custom listing for you<br /><br />almost all of them are reasonable dudes that will work with you. in the event that he doesn&#039;t theres 100 more vendors who might consider it... just a thought.

				Foxen,&nbsp; Found the thread &quot;Official Spare Coins Thread&quot; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=65125.0<br /><br />Morph, Exactly loading up with BC is a pain in the ass process anyways!! So to go through it, end up short and then have to go through it again for under $10 sucks!! ugh!<br /><br />BTW I paid $280 and only ended up with $255 in account!!! Wth?! I went $20 over what I needed! idkkkkk :) <br />Got my product today, yay! :)

				Thanks Jasmine for the Spare Coins Thread URL...&nbsp; I bookmarked it - figure what comes around goes around and it&#039;s always good to see people helping each other out.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t post anything in it...&nbsp; guess you have to have at least 50 posts probably...&nbsp; &nbsp;sent someone a PM though.<br /><br />BTW, congrats on having received your item.... and also looks like you only need 3 more posts to reach that &quot;magic number&quot;... :)
