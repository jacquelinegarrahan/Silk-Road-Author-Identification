				I read RxKing&#039;s post about SR working perfectly - gave it a try and couldn&#039;t get past the login page, but hey, who&#039;s been able to get that far in the past 3-days!&nbsp; DPR &amp; Admin, thank you for all of your efforts!!&nbsp; I thought it was great when everyone banned together yesterday trying to figure it out.&nbsp; That&#039;s a community effort and that&#039;s what SR is, a community of good people who work together to get things done.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure DPR &amp; Admin have a lot more work to do but hey, even the best need some rest.&nbsp; We should put together a community pool where we can just send bitcoin to support SR, commissions alone can&#039;t pay for this kind of community.&nbsp; I know a lot of you, including me don&#039;t have a lot of BTC to spend, but every little bit counts.&nbsp; I&#039;d put 5-10% of my balance towards it monthly to keep it up and I&#039;m sure a bunch of you would too.<br /><br />Thank you to all and all who didn&#039;t convert over to the dark side.<br /><br />I may be a newbie on this forum, but i&#039;ve been a buyer for a short while now, so hello everyone.&nbsp; Look forward to working with you in better days.<br /><br />Long Live SR!

				The energy the SR nemesis is putting into this attack suggests the culprit is either a government agency, or organized crime looking for &#039;protection&#039; money.<br />I think it&#039;s probably the latter.<br /><br /><br />PB.

				I got on it earlier to check and it was working so well I thought it was back up. So I decided to turn off my computer and go on it later, School.boy.error.
