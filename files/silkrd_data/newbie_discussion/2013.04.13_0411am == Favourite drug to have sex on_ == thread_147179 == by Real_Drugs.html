				I fuck like a mad man on Molly. Have been raving for like 13 years. Getting too old for the rave scene now but, I still love to fuck for hours, days, weeks on E. I don&#039;t take too much because then I can&#039;t cum. The way I can tell if I took too much is if it becomes difficult to piss then I took too much. I can wear out 3 girls in one night with a few good pills. Seriously 3 chicks in a row all have said &quot; Enough or I&#039;m done can we please stop&quot; I&#039;ve done this many times over the years as a raver daddy. I would destroy party monster girls every other week this way! I&#039;ve tried sex on speed/meth. I cum way too fast and then it&#039;s limp dick all night. I&#039;ve tried sex on coke and the same thing happens. Premature limpy wimpy dicky! When I fuck on Molly / X / E, I am a GOD in the sack. It gives me super human fuck skills. The bad part is that the girls that fuck me on Molly tend to expect similar performances every time. SOOOOOOOO, when they come over I HAVE to have Molly on hand or they go home feeling cheated.&nbsp; ;)

				I was introduced to meth through sex. I don&#039;t know how all of you people can&#039;t get hard on it. I think you need to get better looking sexual partners. Or a cock ring. I have had a problem a few times and needed a viagra but most of the timei slap a cock ring on and I am ready to go. Sometimes I last all night especially when I am g&#039;ed up but a lot.of the time I do cum too quickly. Nut give me 20 minutes and a fewore hits and I cab go again. Or I can bottom for someone. That&#039;s the great thing about being a versatile gay male.

I&#039;ll try to remember to +1 you when I reach 50. <br /><br />I also think addictions have a snowball effect in our brains. The more addictions you possess the more prone you are to forming another addiction. Hence why some people don&#039;t have very addictive personalities and other due. I guess that means anyone with a decent sized addictive personality will eventually be fucked. Or maybe its drugs that Start to cause the snowball effect. Or I am just completely batshit insane. Lol.

You just don&#039;t care because you are drunk. Plus I&#039;m not a fan of alcohol when there are so many other drugs with more controlled effects to do. <br /><br />I would love to hear more of your story and try to throw out some advice but itculd be personal. Send a pm of you want. I hope its due to timing and not a lack of sex. Cause everyone deserves sex daily :-)

Lol. I think the best sex has to be good for both of the participants and also needs to be viewable on a video once sober. But a lot of people don&#039;t film regularly either and don&#039;t have that option.<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m a selfish bastard ha ha

				I&#039;d have to say MDMA then on the comedown you take some viagra 50mg works usually. Then we start taking bumps of Ketamine. I have been with my lover and transported to untold cyberpunk, future Japanese themed realms on some occasions. It can get pretty magical and next level. The crazy thing is we both have the same hallucinations most of the time.

				i loved having sex while bumping cocaine and ketamine from my lover&#039;s body, it was unforgettable! so now i still do it when i&#039;m alone to masturbate since my new girlfriend stopped using. the only thing is that i can do this for hours and then i forget to sleep and feel so tired on the next day :/.
