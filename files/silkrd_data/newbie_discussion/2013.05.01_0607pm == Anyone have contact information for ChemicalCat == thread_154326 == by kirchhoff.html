				hey im here. all orders have been taken care of and shipped out. Kirchhoff can let ya&#039;ll know wednesday prolly that he has infact received his pack with extras as well as an apology letter that went out to everyone. ive had a rough past couple weeks... basically been living in the hospital, first my face fucks up with an infection and then a drunk driver gives me and my homie an unplanned ride in an ambo on a board with a brace, as well as t-boning our truck, totaled. we were sober at the time so its all on him, guy ran a red light trying to race towards a yellow, thats the kinda shit you see in chickfliks and lifetime movies. now im back out hobbling(kindof) with a brace and pins in my leg, just trying to do everyday things.<br /><br />so yea just saw these posts and now i can say everyone will get their packs and feel a bit of relief from the stress of having so many people pissed at me... ugh lol.
