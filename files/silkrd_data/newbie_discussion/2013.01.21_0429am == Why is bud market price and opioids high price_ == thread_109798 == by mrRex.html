				I assume it has to do with supply and demand...where I live Roxy 30&#039;s (30mg instant release oxycodone for those that don&#039;t take em or arent into em) are about half the price they are on here.&nbsp; Yet bud goes for market price...and is actually priced competitively in some instances.&nbsp; <br /><br />I assume this is because in some areas of the country opioids go for around $1 U.S. per milligram, and the demand from these high priced areas sets the price to match that of their market, setting the bar at $1 per mg or more on here.&nbsp; Yet good bud can be found for $280-320 an oz which is a decent price, although in the last 10 years bud has gotten much more common knowledge and people are growing all over the U.S. so maybe the bud prices are more stable.&nbsp; Still, in some markets bud is high priced but I do not see the same effect of a high priced market driving up the overall price on here, as it does with pills.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it has to do with supply and demand, like I stated briefly and very layman like above.&nbsp; Could go into detailed economics but this is not the time or place as it wouldn&#039;t further the conversation and rather would derail it.&nbsp; Also opiate users are often addicts so they might have more urgency to get their product where if a pothead waits an extra day they don&#039;t get sick.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

				I assume because bud is legal in alot of states and it&#039;s hard to get scrips. Also, with bud you dont really know what your getting til you get it. With prescription drugs its the same quality every time. Norco are $2 in my area and sell for $7-$10 each on this site so I know what you mean. But even but is kinda high on here. i buy from a club and its way cheaper but remember your also paying for safety and being anonymous.

				I agree, in general.&nbsp; Yet whether you buy 1 or 50 roxy 30s the price is around $30 each.&nbsp; which they cost in parts of the country they cost more than about anywhere.&nbsp; and there arent really bulk discounts on these...but other items I agree the bulk prices are great.

				im southwest...not florida south...wont say more on here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have seen them 20-25 in other areas...but had friends in same areas who say they can be 15 if have the right hook.&nbsp; here they are 15 always...what do you find them for in your area?&nbsp; im tempted to put some online for 20-25 or somewhere in that range...much cheaper than the 30-35 each on here.&nbsp; 30 I can see...35 is just insane.&nbsp; I need to wait til funds are right for a sellers account and I will have cheaper ones here hopefully knock on wood<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109798.msg747805#msg747805">Quote from: sporkehh on January 21, 2013, 04:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i assume your in the south rex, i havent had cheap roxies since i left the panhandle<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Seller love to baby there items and over hype them up as if there the best ever, thats why prices are high and I think these sellers have someway to contact each other. I noticed one seller going after tastereats because of his pricings they were unbeatable now he lists them privately so he doesn&#039;t get harassed by other seller(s).
