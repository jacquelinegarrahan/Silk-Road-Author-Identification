				I used bitinstant and MP&#039;d to Virwox.<br /><br />There was an error in the transaction but it was the right address.<br /><br />Virwox replied and said they were a victim of&nbsp; &quot;another DDOS-attack&quot; and asked BitInstant Support to &quot;please resend the funds&quot; but for some reason this sounds really weird? I&#039;m pretty sure Bitcoins don&#039;t just disappear and I&#039;ve read from multiple sources that Virwox is reputable.<br /><br />Any hero/seniors out there that can lend there .02 btc?<br />Please and thanks! Lots of loot at hand :/

				I can pretty much say with certainty that if Virwox did say that to you they would be telling the truth they&#039;re a very reputable 3rd party broker in other online alternate currency such as Linden dollars in second life,hang in there dude shit happens.but I cant see why they wouldn&#039;t be telling the truth.<br />Follow the support and work with them you&#039;ll get sorted i imagine.

				from what I know of virwox (I&#039;ve been using them on and off for years) and they guy who runs it, they&#039;re extremely reputable.&nbsp; I think they had a ddos a few weeks back so it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if they&#039;ve been hit again, after all, a lot of the bitcoin places seem to have been hit down the last few weeks.<br /><br />I&#039;m sad though, it looks like they&#039;re probably too busy to send my money out (if they can) I can see I&#039;m never going to get funds into here!!&nbsp;
