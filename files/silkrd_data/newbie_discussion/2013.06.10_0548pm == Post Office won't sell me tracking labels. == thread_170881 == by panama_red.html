				I&#039;ve been to 3 PO&#039;s and either they don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about or one even said I had to bring the package in to ship it and they can&#039;t sell my a pre-paid tracking label. What are you guys doing to get them? Is there a certain one I need to ask for? The employees are either acting or are dumb about this. I want to open a vendor account and before I do I want to have everything ready to go so I can just drop them off in a blue box. Any help would be great. Also what is the max weight for box drops, 13oz? Thanks again.

				They don&#039;t do delivery confirmation with the yellow labels anymore. Go to usps.com and read up on shipping. They offer a label if you are going to print from home when you buy postage. Yes, you are right about the 13 oz limit but it only applies to stamped mail. Metered can be heavier. Ever see a collection driver empty a blue box. He pulls out the white bucket and replaces it with another. There is a good chance that your package may not get scanned until delivery.<br />Peace

				It is form 400.&nbsp; They are just stickers with an extra tag on the bottom for you to keep with a copy of the #.&nbsp; Not every USPS employee knows about them.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the reply. I just got back from the PO and told them I needed some of the 400 labels and he told me they don&#039;t sell anything like that and you can only order those labels with tracking online. He didn&#039;t even know what a 400 was. Shouldn&#039;t they have to know their job? I don&#039;t wanna buy them with my credit card or go through the hassle of faking a prepaid card. How do this people have jobs when they don&#039;t even know their own forms? I guess they are just playing dumb in order to help to &quot;war on drugs&quot; or something. Is that all you asked for, the form 400? He told me they dont sell any labels with tracking. Or am I wrong in thinking its a prepaid shipping label? Is it just a tracking form and then I just add stamps? I thought it was a flat rate shipping label.

				I literally just picked up my first label 400 anonymously today.<br /><br />I just walked in to the PO and told them I was printing postage from my office, and needed to track.&nbsp; I understand that you offer &quot;label 400&quot; to do that&quot;.&nbsp; The first guy I talked to asked the clerk next to them, he/she pulled out a big roll and asked me how many I wanted.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t charge me, but I do not they think would work unless you were paying for priority or &gt; 1st class postage.&nbsp;

				Ok cool, thanks. Yeah I was confused in thinking they were a prepaid flat rate thing. So it&#039;s just a tracking form then you pay for postage, cool. How do you pay for postage anoyn? What&#039;s the safest way? You don&#039;t think I can just use stamps? Don&#039;t see why not as long as I put enough on the package. These are small packages the size of a dvd case in a little padded envelope. Any suggestions? I will try a diferent PO tomorrow. Wanna have this all sorted before I start selling. Thanks again for the info, man.

				Stamps are fine.&nbsp; That is the whole point of the 400 form.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to print the postage in order to get a tracking # assignment.&nbsp; You can get stamps in exact priority mail denominations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note: fingerprints are supposedly very easy to leave behind on tape or adhesive labels.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would make sure I knew exactly the postage I needed.&nbsp; Buy a bunch of priority mail stamps at an out-of-town PO.&nbsp; Ship in standard sizes, and repeat as necessary when you run out of forms.&nbsp; Pretty much assume you are caught on video at the post office.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about printed stamps from a Dymo or Pitney Bowes.&nbsp; I think that those still have some kind of serial number traceable to your billing information.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that at all, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen too many printed stamps from vendors.&nbsp; Some.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Alright thanks Dirk Diggler, lol. Really. How much are priority stamps and what&#039;s the difference? Are they good for a certain weight or is it just faster than a bunch of regular stamp? Last questions, I promise. :) Thanks again, man.

				Again, it depends on the size, weight, and what kind of package you are sending.&nbsp; The USPS &quot;Small Flat Rate Priority Box&quot; seems popular with vendors.&nbsp; It needs a $5.80 stamp. There are other size flate rate boxes, as well as flat rate envelopes.&nbsp; You need to go to usps.com and put in the size and weight to make sure you are getting the right postage.&nbsp;
