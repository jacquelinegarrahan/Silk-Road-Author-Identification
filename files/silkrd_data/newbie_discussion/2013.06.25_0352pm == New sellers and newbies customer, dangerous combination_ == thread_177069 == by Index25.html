				Hi people!!!<br /><br />Obviously, I am a newbie in the Road ;<br /><br />I found a seller with 0 sales, business is it wise to do so? Or is it better to buy only reputable sellers with good feedback?<br /><br />I hope this is understood, my english in very bad, sorry (<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Index25<br /><br />PS: I&#039;m glad to be part of this community

				Every vendor starts somewhere just like every buyer (like yourself) will have his first transaction<br /><br />I would advise you to have your first orders from some more reputable vendors ONLY so you can understand and feel how SR goes like<br /><br />Also dont FE on new sellers, infect I wouldn&#039;t advise you to FE at all but you&#039;ll see that some vendors (new and old) asks for new buyers to FE, you can easily avoid that by either buying some 0.001 BTC books or maybe LOTO tickets or just look for those vendors who wouldnt ask you to FE no matter what (they exist^^)<br /><br />EDIT: SUPER important! always check the forums as well! some vendors seems to have great feedback but ends up being scammers

				Hi Index<br /><br />I am new to SR as well and for my first purchases I decided to go with sellers that had a high feedback rating. I did this because I didn&#039;t want to get burnt with my first purchase and decided to trust the other SR members.<br /><br />I also from previous experience (on another Black market site) found the sellers with higher feedback ratings even though will take longer to get back to you are more likely to reship free of charge if there is a problem with the order.<br /><br />Good Luck

				Always be weary with new vendors! Never ever FE. Please, just don&#039;t. You never need to FE, just find a vendor who excepts newbies. Also, use the forum to look up vendors and make sure you don&#039;t get selectively scammed. Stay safe Index :]

I was responding to LibertyCoin who mentioned that as a vendor it is hard to get credibility without established sales and feedback. So one potential way to mitigate that is to offer your service or product free of charge to a select number of customers.

				I am already bonded and put up the 4.5btc for the vendor account. As far as free sample&#039;s im not selling anything other than btc exchanges. Im not looking to screw anyone over just start some business:) I cant get my bond back without good feedback anyways. Im willing to bet i can beat anyone&#039;s delivery times and provide exceptional service like the establish trusted vendors. I already have more than enough btc loaded into this account and ready for someone to give me a chance.

It is a nice gesture when it is given and not asked for, but it totally screws up the resolution process if things go wrong, so it is better for all parties in the long run.<br /><br />However, it has also been demonstrated that an unscrupulous buyer can use FE as part of a reverse scam:<br /><br />* Buyer makes purchase and FE&#039;s<br />* Claims non-arrival<br />* Suggests that you are scammer and insists on a refund less than 48 hours after it being dispatched<br />* Then threatens your business by dragging it out on the forums, in the hope that the implied distress will be enough to get you to dish out a refund OUTSIDE of the normal escrow process.<br /><br />This is done in order to maintain really good looking buyer stats, so that when an order is placed, the vendor has no reason to think that they are about to get rinsed.<br /><br />So, yeah. No FE.<br /><br />Unless you are ordering 15kgs of coke from Columbia. Then I could understand who someone might seek some kind of assurances.&nbsp; :)

				Agreed. Usually there is no reason to FE. We recently starting asking new users without any history to do so because in all the orders we have the only &quot;wheres my stuff even though tracking says it was delivered&quot; complains came from newbies with little to no history. <br /><br />The escrow process protects buyer and seller. As much as I would like to get my coins faster its there for a reason.<br /><br />@@CaliGirl@@

				I was seriously considering buying some stuff from a relatively new vendor, but, as a newbie myself have decided not to.<br /><br />By the time I&#039;m back home (cause I&#039;m not the kind of dick who would get my stuff sent to a friend&#039;s house while I&#039;m on vacation), that vendor will have been around for a bit longer.&nbsp; Depending on what his stats are, I might buy then.&nbsp; Not now.<br /><br />Safest thing to do as a newbie is buy from someone that has stats.

				I dont think it is a dangerous combo.&nbsp; From what I have read, there are veteran buyers that try to pull just as much shit as anyone else. <br /><br />As long as you dont FE, I dont see what the issue is.&nbsp; I havent been around long but I am not going to drop any significant amount with any seller until I try them out.&nbsp; I might be willing to do a bit more with an experienced seller though.

				Hi Liberty Coin,&nbsp; What percentage to you charge for btc?&nbsp; You might want to offer a very good exchange rate, at least initially, to build up your ratings.&nbsp; I know MoneyHoney did that.&nbsp; I got superb service from him/her and wrote a positive review in the forums.&nbsp; MH did very well, got lots of great reviews and then upped her rate.&nbsp; They are very reliable, but the exchange rate which had been 5% when they were getting started went up to 15% so I stopped using them.&nbsp; In any case, I recommend something like that to build up your vendor rating.&nbsp; What do you charge for btc?
