				Recently I used Coinbase and was pretty pleased with it. I did have to link it to my bank account and real name which many aren&#039;t comfortable with. But buying bitcoins is not illegal and they&#039;re very hard to track once they&#039;ve been spent. I went with coinbase because their fees are next-to-nothing. I think it cost me less than $2 for my purchase. It did take 3 days to confirm my account then one week to receive the coins, but I wasn&#039;t in a hurry so I didn&#039;t mind. I would recommend this service if you&#039;re not hurried and aren&#039;t moving a lot of money.

				&nbsp;I would say most people get their coins from mt.GOX. The only problem is, because they are a legit business, requires you to Verify you&#039;re account with a proof of residency and a legal ID. So naturally people have reservations. They seam like one of the most legit exchangers though. Once you buy the bitcoins, then move it to a different address you&#039;re fine. I don&#039;t believe anyone on the SR would ever need information from you&#039;re Mt.GOX account or anything like that so it should be safe to use you&#039;re real info.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				I used localbitcoins for my first decent sized amount and was pleased with it.&nbsp; Just look for a seller who doesn&#039;t require too much info from you; I was fine doing a e-transfer to my bank from the one I chose (who also happened to have the lowest prices at the time) and then redirecting the coins to my main wallet, then to SR.

				Please read this !<br /><br />The easiest and safest way to purchase bitcoins is directly through your local bank ! Yes bitcoins are legal and the bank doesn&#039;t really care what you do with them! and it takes much less time than the usual transfer. <br /><br />We always use simple bank transfer and the fee is also low ! Please consider this simple method !&nbsp; :)

				bitinstant is the best. they do not require validation of identity. the fees can be steep however. sometimes i wind up making extra bitcoins when i use them, but usually i see about a $20 fee for around $500 deposit. it&#039;s simple; anonymous; no id required; you can make up the sender info<br /><br />to the poster who said mt.gox does not require validation, i have had to validate.

				Haven&#039;t bought BTC in a while (I play poker for BTC and have done pretty well lately), but if I do buy coins it&#039;s through Bitinstant. They&#039;re about as hassle free as it gets.

				Contrary to what someone wrote above, bitinstant has very reasonable fees.<br /><br />Contrary to what someone else wrote, going through your bank is a bad idea, links the coins directly to you.
