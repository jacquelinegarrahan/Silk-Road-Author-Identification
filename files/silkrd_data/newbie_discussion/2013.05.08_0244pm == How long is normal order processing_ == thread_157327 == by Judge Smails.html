				Hey guys/gals. I got an order in on Sat. with a reputable weed vendor and this order is still in the &quot;processing&quot; stage. How long do you think is a normal processing time since today is Wed. and it&#039;s still processing. I don&#039;t want to be a newbie harassing dick about things but I&#039;m starting to wonder if this vendor is considering taking a giant shit on me cause I&#039;m a newbie. The option to cancel has appeared and I definitely don&#039;t want to cancel. Any thoughts.

				usually depends on the vendor but i have never had an order stay in processing for more than 48 hours! Your at 4 days now, I would maybe send the vendor a message, does the vendor have timescales on the SR page?

				No he doesn&#039;t but he did require that buyers with less than 5 transactions to send a message before ordering. Which I did and which was read. Still no word. I did send a message again today which has not been read yet so I&#039;m anxiously waiting for a reply. Again I&#039;m just trying to get a general idea of how long an order usually remains processing. I don&#039;t want to name the vendor for fear of him taking a giant shiat on yours truly. Or worse cancelling my order.&nbsp; :-\

				No mention of long processing times. I placed this order towards the end of the DOS attacks but it went through and the message was read. Maybe due to these attacks on the road he became backed up. As I am new to the road I really don&#039;t want to stir up a shit pot because most of it is going to get spilled on me. I am willing to be patient but I am also seeing other buyers talking about how fast their orders are being received. If I don&#039;t hear anything soon I have a decision to make. Does anyone think there would be any negative consequences to cancelling an order after 5 or 6 days processing with no communication with the vendor?

				Fuck me. Just looked at their vendor page and due to the attacks and being backed up there new policy is less than $500 spent and/or less than 60 days on SR you they are refusing to fulfill the orders. BEND OVER NEWBIE and take it &gt;:(

				Vendors have 4 days from the time you place your order to mark it &#039;in transit&#039;. This was temporarily extended to 7 days to allow for the downtime caused by the DDoS attack, but is back to 4 days now. If they do not ship the order within that 4 day time-frame you are free to cancel it.<br /><br />Please keep in mind though that many vendors are incredibly busy catching up on things. However, as Silk Road is a free market, you are free to cancel any orders that take longer than 4 days to process and order elsewhere.<br /><br />Libertas

				I am not really upset about the delay as I realize that SR was under attack. What kind of pissed me of is there brand new policy of excluding those new members with not enough purchases / time on SR. That was the curveball. I have since placed an order with another vendor. I guess my mom will not get any bud in time for mother&#039;s day. <br /><br />&nbsp;::)
