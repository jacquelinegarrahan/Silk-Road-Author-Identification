				does it make you feel more at ease?<br /><br />i havent received anything yet (only just made my first orders), but my doormen receives all packages for me (and i get a lot on amazon) and also notify me if i had any visitors<br /><br />he checks every day for me and hands them to me himself, so obviously if it wasnt my door man i wouldnt take the package<br /><br />and also if they called me saying some dark suited men are there, i would say turn them away

				Hey bolorolo,<br /><br />first: welcome &amp; congrats on finding your way to the road!<br />to your question: i have no experience with doormen at all...but my first thought was that you put another human being in the process of receiving your products. and well..humans are humans, means you never can predict what happens, so i myself would never do so. you add a little bit of risk that way in my opinion; even if you know that person very well; my question here would be, is there no way for you to do it otherwise?<br /><br />cheers <br />schreckse

				I think having a doorman is better because at least you don&#039;t have to worry about signing for anything. It might be a good way to avoid getting CD&#039;d as well, but I&#039;m not sure if the doorman would cooperate with the police or not.

				well, i prefer only small orders, only from vendors with some pages of good feedback on stealth, and domestic only. I still give out my adress to the vendor, encrypted or privnote.com. <br />If theres any more secure way, someone please tell me:)

				Don&#039;t ever use privnote. It&#039;s less secure than sending you address unencryted for a number of reasons.. PGP is very good though but it&#039;s best to only deal with vendors that have at least a 2048bit key, smaller keys aren&#039;t as secure.

				I wonder what&#039;s up with privote.&nbsp; Not since I&#039;ve been here have I heard so much negativity towards it.&nbsp; These people should know.&nbsp; I&#039;m done with it.
