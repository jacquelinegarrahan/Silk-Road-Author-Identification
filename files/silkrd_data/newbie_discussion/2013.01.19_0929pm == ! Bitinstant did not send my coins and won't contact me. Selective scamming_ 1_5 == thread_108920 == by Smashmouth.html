				&nbsp;I&#039;ve created this new account to talk about an issue I&#039;m having with Bitinstant and to reach out to any other members of SR who are having a similar problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;I recently turned a 500usd transaction through Bitinstant. They reported my coins as deposited to my wallet, but never actually sent them. Naturally I checked the blockchain and no, they did not send my coins.<br /><br />&nbsp;So I contact Bitinstant customer support via their channels. I sent a &quot;live chat&quot; query and received no attention. So I sent an email to support, and received no attention. So I sent an email to the account which delivered notice of my transaction being executed... and received no attention.<br /><br />&nbsp;Several hours ago, I called Bitinstant&#039;s hotline. If youre not familiar, youre connected with a voicemail system that tells you to only make contact if its an emergency and that Bitinstant will call you back. I received no contact back.<br /><br />&nbsp;Bitinstant is not trustworthy and I would not do business with them again. I wanted my coins fast, and instead I&#039;ve been robbed.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am not a criminal enterprise and I will fight for my funds shamelessly and without anonymity if necessary. I have all the evidence of my transaction.<br />&nbsp;

				How recently did you send them money?&nbsp; Also, you need to just keep trying to get in touch with a live person via their support number.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t scammers and they WILL make it right for you - keep trying!&nbsp; You can also find the main bitinstant guy on bitcointalk.org as Yankee, I believe.

				I had this same type of thing happen to me. I attempted to do 2 $500 transactions in one day and the second one never showed any evidence in block chain of being completed, despite zipzap and bitinstant confirmation emails. <br /><br />I emailed their technical support multiple times in the following 2 days and never got a reply. Then I sent a message to their support directly from the bitinstant page. In a day I was able to talk to a customer service representative and I gave her my info and she forwarded it to the technical department and they pushed the coins through.<br /><br />Overall it took about 4 days to get my coins...I wouldn&#039;t worry OP, Bitinstant is trying to build a reputation as a reputable business and are not out to scam SR users.

				I was so convinced that they found out I was sending the coins to my SR wallet and decided not to send them because its not like I could go to the cops or anything. This is not the case. They want your business now and in the future. Just keep sending messages to their customer service people and once you finally get a hold of one they will make sure that your coins get through.

You should know that the destination of your coins doesn&#039;t prevent you from going to the cops. I&#039;m not even sure that they can tell its an SR wallet specifically, and even if they knew for sure, who&#039;s to say you&#039;re going to buy something illegal. I haven&#039;t bought anything illegal off SR and I wanted a lot of money in my account... Go figure.<br /><br />I hope they get in touch though. I&#039;d like to work thing out as efficiently as possible.

				I&#039;ve made about 10 transfers so far through BitInstant to Blockchain but never had a problem until Sunday afternoon. Received the zipzap confirmation almost instantly, waited about 3 hours, then e-mailed bitinstant. Next, morning, nothing. Sent another e-mail. Around noon, still nothing so I tried their &quot;live chat&quot; which is really just e-mail, but they responded in about 20 minutes. They said the server crashed and caused a bunch of transactions to stall, and support would send it through in a little bit. About two hours later the coins were in my wallet.

				In my experience, Bitinstant is very professional and you will always get your coins eventually. Just keep working with customer service until you get your coin. Bitinstant is one of the most legit BTC merchants around. They are a decent sized legitimate business, not some shady anonymous dealer. A few hundred bucks is in no way worth them taking a hit to their reputation. Personally I&#039;ve used them many times for amounts from around $100 up to about $1000 and I always get my coin within a few hours. Keep calm and work with them if a problem arises.

				&nbsp;I&#039;m so tired now... I&#039;ll definitely be back to make a better explanation<br /><br />I did finally receive my coins. Customer support was useless and I never got any real attention.<br /><br />I really do think that Bitinstant is selectively scamming buyers who match a certain profile.<br /><br />They&#039;ll tell you that your payment processed as fraudulent, but you can verify that claim yourself.

				Ok OK OK this thread is confusing the crap out of me. OP you said bitinstant didn&#039;t send your coins? Can you elaborate a little please or at least elaborate to a message to the mods if you don&#039;t want to give away info. Bitinstant... if I am not mistaken is a funding company that funds your exchange for you to buy the coins... not directly send them to you... am I wrong here??? does bitinstant also do a funding and direct deposit of bitcoins because they have always just funded my exchange account THEN i was able to buy my coins.... Am i the one retarded here, does bitinstant really do direct bitcoin deposits to an address?

				Hmm... I did not know they exchanged cash directly for BTC, they&#039;ve always just funded my account IN ORDER for me to buy off an exchange<br /><br />And yes they probably do submit to court orders or subpoenas or warrants or whatever pressure LE could lay on them, they are a company that works out in the open legitimately so I&#039;m sure their hands are tied on that (however does anyone know where bitinstant is based in? if it is based in America then yes I would expect them to help LE when pressured however i don&#039;t know)&nbsp; If you do get your coins tumble them and/or send them sporadically around to different addresses if you are that paranoid. i&#039;m not saying don&#039;t be paranoid but too much can cripple you here. There are many ways to obscure who and where the coins came from, which is the beauty of BTC. I think I&#039;ll start a post about that actually, since my knowledge of obfuscating coins is also pretty limited

				I&#039;m really getting fed up with bitinstant as well. I&#039;ve made about 8 successful transactions so far with them, but my coins never dropped in my wallet from almost a day ago even though I got confirmation from the bill to company.<br /><br />And so in case you don&#039;t get your coins it&#039;s like you might as well go fuck yourself because good fucking luck getting one of their customer service reps to get back to you. Their so called &quot;live support&quot; is a fucking joke because it&#039;s dead. The only thing &quot;live&quot; about it is that you submit your request using adobe flash technology instead of a html form page. woohoo.<br /><br />God what a fucking deadbeat owner. He needs to open up his fucking wallet and hire a decent support staff. Not like he&#039;s not making enough.<br /><br />

				Ok guys i am another one the people that seams to be being scammed by BITINSTNT.&nbsp; I just bought 200.00 BTC 2 days ago the moment i suspected that it wasnt going through..&#039;the next day&quot; i started PM ing everyone from&nbsp; YANKEE supposed CEO of BITINSTNT and alll to no avail..This company as of now is UNTRUSTABLE&nbsp; STAY AWAY.. I finally got a PM from someone at the support part and they send a pre fab message saying we are very sorry blah blah blah and that they have pushed your coins through..This is not true. Next i was asctually able to speak with Yankee and he said something about a GLICH in the system and this was happening to alot of people..<br />I have a block chain wallet so i figure that when i went to deposit cash that BITINSNT was good to go.I have many trans. with them that went flawlessly ..any thought guys Im ready to start really posting at every place i can about how bad this co. is..<br />I really dont want any problems but i cant just shake off 200.00 every 5 transaction..Im more than upset with the lack off support on their part.Thanks for listening .

				The support staff finally got back to me after the steady stream of more and more abusive support requests I made over the course of 6 hours, basically to ask that I not spam them over and over again with ONE stalled order. Which really if they knew anything about customer service, really didn&#039;t have to happen had they replied to me to first time about the &quot;server delay&quot; that had caused the stall for many users, but that she would ensure my order would be the first to be pushed through and she would do it herself if she could but would ensure later that it was done, blah blah blah <br /><br />10 minutes later chaching.<br /><br />Moral of the story? Spam them with as many abusive support requests as possible if you want to get dialed back in sooner and until their cheapskate owner hires a support staff competent enough to write a customized letter to those affected by server stalls on their end.&nbsp; ::)

SR has decent protection against scamming. It&#039;s called Escrow. Those that don&#039;t use it are taking their own risks. They also raised the price of vending accounts to $500 back in December, which seems to have helped keep scamming to a minimum.

				Just so everyone knows. If you havent got your BTC after 1 hour of your deposit at Bitinstant, get on the bitcointalk forum, newbie section, and post in the Official Newbie Bitinstant support Thread and get this guy URSAY to acknowledge your problem.

There&#039;s just one customer support guy on that thread responding to people bitching and hes typing like 400 wpm, to every comment, for 14 hours, then he goes to sleep, and all the posts start complaining that no one is responding. he wakes up to a bunch of angry people and starts all over again.

				I don&#039;t even know why anyone even uses bitinstant anymore. I had nothing but problems last couple times I used them. They also charge way too much.<br /><br />The best way to get coin is bitfloor.com by just going into any bank of america and making a cash deposit. It&#039;s instant, no ID required, and you can even hit them from TOR if you want. The best part? <br /><br />It&#039;s DIRT FUCKING CHEAP. <br /><br />1%<br /><br />The 7%+ bitinstant charges is fucking highway robbery.

I got this by going onto bitcointalk and posting my order id and issue. USRAY is a bitinstant rep there and helping people. i asked that my issue be escalated and i followed up 2 times before getting my money finally. Check the link below. <br /><br />&nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.4400

Bitfloor is gone forever. But yeah, Bitinstant is a ripoff compared to what Bitfloor was. And Bitfloor was much much much easier than Bitinstant, and much less of a headache waiting for customer support filling out tickets and wasting weeks of your time.
