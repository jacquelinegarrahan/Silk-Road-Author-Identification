				I am not a new seller, only new to the boards, so check out my listings and trust my feedback score.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; <br /><br />I offer OVERNIGHT EXPRESS shipping, in fact just mail out a package of subutex with five free klonopin today with that shipping option.&nbsp; Gimme a chance like that guy did.&nbsp; ;)<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />2MG KLONOPIN (clonazepam):&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/432e0a2841<br /><br />8MG SUBUTEX (buprenorphine):&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c56e8dbbd2<br /><br />And I now also have:<br /><br />PHENOBARBITAL: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/afee93efa3<br /><br />NALTREXONE: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d0dbafac45<br /><br /><br /><br />Toodaloo.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />P.S. Always, ALWAYS check my seller profile for the latest news on me and my selling business here on the SR as opposed to the forums.&nbsp; I will much likely get back to you lightening fast quicker if you message me through Silk Road itself.&nbsp; oooooner is my seller name (five oh&#039;s, not four... do not confuse as four is someone else&#039;s!).&nbsp; <br /><br />I update my profile page often.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/554c1d2e3b<br /><br />5 oh&#039;s!!!

				Dude the withdraw symptoms with klonopin (clonazepan) absolutely blows. Worse than any hard drug including heroin&nbsp; trust me. You get a good high with it but this shit messes with your brain way to much. I&#039;m talking about brain tremors that will last months when you come off it. Not worth it! Enter at your own risk, I wanted to kill my Dr. for prescribing me this poison. Just do your research before you fuck with this stuff, not anything to play around with just saying.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I agree with BudMaster completely, do your research, and by no means EVER do the two products I have up for sale right now together at the same time.&nbsp; I, too, had a doc write me scripts for Xanax like candy and I became an addict over the course of about five years and I am still struggling, four years after that.&nbsp; I feel for you... *hugs*<br /><br />P.S. From my last post.&nbsp; Always, ALWAYS check my seller profile for the latest news on me and my selling business here on the &#039;Road as opposed to the forums.&nbsp; I will much likely get back to you lightening fast quicker if you message me through Silk Road itself.&nbsp; oooooner is my seller name (five oh&#039;s, not four... do not confuse as four is someone else&#039;s!)<br />Thanks!

				Yes, kickin&#039; the shorter acting benzos, aka Xanax, is a lot more difficult than coming off of the longer acting ones that&#039;s for sure, in this case Klonopin.&nbsp; <br /><br />And by no means to compare or diminish anyone&#039;s withdrawal symptoms or the trauma they went through, but guys, opiate withdrawal is by far the worst of them all.&nbsp; It&#039;s so bad they GIVE YOU BENZOS to help, lol.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been down both roads, benzo and opiate addiction, so I understand that both suck in their own ways.<br /><br />Let&#039;s just be glad we&#039;re all (in this thread anyway) past this now and move on. :)
