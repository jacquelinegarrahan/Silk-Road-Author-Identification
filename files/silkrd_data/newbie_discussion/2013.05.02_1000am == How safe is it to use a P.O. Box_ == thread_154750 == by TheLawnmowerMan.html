				So, I&#039;m getting ready to make my first purchase of some MDMA: red question marks. I need to figure out where is the safest place to send such a delicate package.<br /><br />P.O. Boxes seems like a good option for various reasons but there is still the unnerving problem of having to enter the post office and pickup the package.<br /><br />Can anyone give me some tips on how safe P.O. Boxes are compared to having a package delivered to someone&#039;s house. <br /><br />How exactly does the whole P.O. Box thing work? Is it like a lockbox that I&#039;m given a key to unlock, or do I have to ask a postal clerk to retrieve whatever mail is in my P.O. for me?<br /><br />I realize that there is always considerable risk involved in sending/receiving illegals but I feel the more informed I am of the whole process the better prepared I will be.<br /><br />

				Hi TLMM,<br /><br />Glad to hear you&#039;re ready to make your first purchase. First and foremost what I&#039;d recommend before deciding to buy is to look up the vendors feedback thread on the forums and see what other people have said. The most important thing you want your vendor to be concentrating on is stealth, open and honest communication<br /><br />You haven&#039;t told us exactly how many pills you&#039;re ordering so I&#039;m going to go on a limb and say that it&#039;s around the 100-150 range. You want your vendor to be mailing such things to you in an A4 Lettersize envelope and disguise it to look like business communication with printed labels and a legit return business address. I&#039;m not sure which country you&#039;re in but here in Australia general A4 size lettermail from businesses does not warrant a second look or even an x-ray and is most of the times auto scanned and sent to be delivered, which brings me to my next part. I would suggest visiting the website of a postal agency in your country. On there you will have a guide which will show you how to IDEALLY write your address labels. Make sure you write your address exactly like that and if need be show your vendor the link. Again this makes a machine simply scan the Address and auto sort it without it needing to go near customs officers even if your package is from a high risk or flagged country (machines are smart....but still machines)<br /><br />While we&#039;re on the topic of lettersized envelopes. Make sure your vendor packs the pill in a manner that one can have a feel of the outside of the package and not feel 150 pills inside. Then no amount of stealth or ideal label printing is going to save you or at least your package<br /><br />Now to P.O. boxes. There is always an inherent risk in using anything, however I feel that if your vendor is doing a kickass job in stealth and both of you are keeping a lookout, updating and evolving your methods as need be there should be absolutely NO problem having it shipped to your home address. Generally P.O. boxes are for people whose parents go through their mail or they have housemates/roomates or...they&#039;re paranoid....or their vendors do a shit job at stealth but somehow they think a P.O. box will save them. Now you can always make up a fake name for your home address (it is NOT true how some people say the mailman gets suspicious when a new name is on an address.....yeah.....no), don&#039;t make it TOO fake. For example if your name is John Smith, make the letter addressed to Sam Smith.<br /><br />Alternatively you can also subscribe to some free magazines by using a made up business name at your home address and using generic labels such as<br /><br />The Director<br />Example Co.<br /><br />after getting a few of those in start ordering your drugs under the same handle but keep changing labels e.g.<br /><br />The Chief Financial Officer<br />Example Co<br /><br />President<br />Example Co<br /><br />whatever may be the case<br /><br />Those work well, however I still feel a &#039;fake-real&#039; name works best.<br /><br />With P.O. boxes, again I don&#039;t know if its any different in your country, here we&#039;re given a key to our P.O. box and you can just go to the Post Office open up your box collect your mail and bail.<br /><br />There are some other ways such as using anonymous drops but that&#039;s something I&#039;d rather not discuss publicly on the forum. I&#039;m sure if you do a bit of research you&#039;ll come across some things.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend you check out the &quot;shipping&quot; section in the forums and MAKE SURE your vendor is 10/5 on stealth. If that&#039;s the case then P.O. box, home address, friends address, anonymous drops all should work well.<br /><br />For bulk you&#039;ll need to break shipments down in smaller quantities and do multiple ships unless you and your vendor can work out some killer methods to get large packages across without warranting second looks.<br /><br />Hope I&#039;ve helped. If you think I have helped at all and have any spare BTC, I currently am in need of 0.4 BTC and would very much be appreciated if you could either donate or provide a short term loan for that amount (I can pay you back by mid-next week)<br /><br />address is: 1NxJJtt83uumnDYc94f5zSetZbXzFjNbtb<br /><br />if you need more help just shoot...

				Hay Lawnmowerman,<br /><br />Welcome to the site, 1stly do a search through the shipping section of the forums. There are a number of posts on the best methods of receiving goods and how the postage system works.<br /><br />Generally you get a key and open them yourself unless the package is so big it doesn&#039;t fit, then you have to go to the counter.<br /><br />My 2 cents on deliveries:<br /><br />1) PO Boxes are OK but a risk that you run into a smart postman when sorting the mail<br />&nbsp;<br />2) Send with your name to a friends address and ask them to collect for you - They can claim it&#039;s not for them if the cops turn up &quot;sorry officer not even my name on the package&quot;<br /><br />3) Best option for successful delivery - Your address with your name. Anyone can send you mail, so if the cops turn up just say &quot;No not for me officer, I wasn&#039;t expecting this package. No idea what it is&quot;&nbsp; This is the option I use and never had an issue.<br /><br />By the way domestic orders are by far the most successful in terms of delivery.<br /><br />Touchthesky has some excellent points also<br /><br />Cheers Admansta

				I&#039;ve only bought small quantities but I send them to my P.O. box. I spell my name slightly incorrectly but close enough that with that and the P.O. box they still sort it to me

				I think as long as you keep to small quantities you should be OK and make sure you are able to deny knowledge of the parcel.

				Keep the quantities low enough that if the package is intercepted then it won&#039;t be worth LE spending the resources to nail you. <br /><br />Therefore why not use your postal address?
