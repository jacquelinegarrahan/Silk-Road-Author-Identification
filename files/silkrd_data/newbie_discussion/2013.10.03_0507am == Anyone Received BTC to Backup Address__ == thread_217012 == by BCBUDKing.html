				I&#039;ve been looking everywhere. I&#039;ve seen a couple confirmations of balance returns but I&#039;m interested in the $500 seller deposit more than anything.

				Your money is very likely gone: DPR would have to hit an &quot;emergency button&quot; (figuratively speaken) that starts all the backup transactions. But do you think when the FBI arrested him at home he said: &quot;Oh, wait, I still have to do some clicks on my laptop. Will you?&quot;, you think they let him?<br /><br />And I don&#039;t think this mechanism was set up as a dead man&#039;s button where DPR would have to confirm every 12 or 24hrs that he is still alive and if he doesn&#039;t hit it the BTC will be released.<br /><br />No way, your money is gone. Just as the money that was in escrow for all the recent buyers.

				The very fact this forum is still running....<br />A dead man in 24h is a bit short , better is 48.<br />The mistake DPR made is using the cloud , this allows backup of server without a way to find out.<br />by simply taking a copy of the image.<br />

				A dead man switch is not a bad idea - but 24-48 hrs is way too long.&nbsp; Just guessing here, but I&#039;m sure DPR wasn&#039;t the only Admin on the system - it would have been way too much to handle for one person.&nbsp; I ran a BBS with 200+ users and had 4 Co-Ops helping out.&nbsp; So to have a DMS set at 6 hrs or so that would send all monies in account to a backup address if none of the admins logged in wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea - if it was a mistake, all we&#039;d have to do is re-send our BTC&#039;s to our account.&nbsp; <br /><br />If the time was set to 24-48 hrs, the FBI would have shutdown the servers by then and no incoming/outgoing data allowed.&nbsp; (May not even work for 6 hrs)<br /><br />Now as far as monies in escrow - that is one I can&#039;t find a solution for.<br /><br />My 2 cents - but it doesn&#039;t seem DPR was too worried about getting caught or buyers/sellers getting paid in the event he was caught.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can only guess what the FBI will do with the seized BTCs - but they have an awful amount of money to play around with to use for sting operations.
