				I don&#039;t think Thurgood ripped me off however I did fe almost a month ago. He messaged me 6 days ago saying he was shipping soon but his profile hasn&#039;t been active since. I tried to find his profile today and it doesn&#039;t exist.

				There are a few different threads on here discussing this Vendor and the many problems people have been having with him. Some even received CD&#039;s if I remember right. If you can get the search function to work, try searching his name as you will find alot of talk about him.&nbsp; IMO there are plenty of other good vendors to buy weed from (assuming that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for)

				Does silk road take down profiles if they aren&#039;t active? that&#039;s the only reason i am worried. I type in his name and it doesn&#039;t come up. Also I paid for 1 Day shipping... This is my biggest purchase on the road yet and i hope it isn&#039;t a negative one. I&#039;m literally screwed if he doesn&#039;t come thru.

				there are quite a few people who have very big FE orders with him and i would be shitting bricks if i were you (or them)... unless u can afford to lose the money..&nbsp; his vendor acct has completely disappeared and according to a Global Moderator on another thread.. his account was banned/suspended due to trading outside of the escrow system, and in order to be re-instated on SR he needs to pay up on all the lost commission/fees that SR lost out on due to him trading outside of the website.&nbsp; for your sake, i really hope he get you your stuff... but i wouldnt hold my breath if i were you.. i would consider it a total loss.. and just consider yourself lucky if it ever shows up.&nbsp; i was just about to order 1/4 LB from him, but all his listings had been taken down... now all the sudden hes not even a vendor anymore.. sounds very very fishy to me....&nbsp; dude probably just became a few thousand dollars richer...&nbsp; with all those FE orders just hanging in the balance....&nbsp; too bad too because i heard is bud was out of this world... and prices were great too<br /><br />source: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=208433.msg1502157#msg1502157&nbsp; &nbsp;(last post)

				I remember that one recently about someone claiming he sent them a pound of dog shit, literally. Why im sure TJ did not do this, its clear hes pissed off a few people, some to the point that they are doing stuff liek that in anger..<br /><br />Not a good vendor, always search the forums and never FE early on anything you care to lose

				FE is always a tough one, I tell people not to, but I do FE sometimes...<br /><br />FE is a risk, no 2 ways about it. Some vendors refuse to take an order if you don&#039;t, we all know they are not supposed to, but it happens all the time and SR don&#039;t seem to fussed, any admin / mod will just say don&#039;t do it thats all lol<br /><br />I ONLY FE IF:<br /><br />1) Its something im not fussed about loosing to much, small orders etc<br />2) If its a seller I trust, that&#039;s not based on his feeback and reviews, thats based on a working relationship with the vendor.<br /><br />If your FE and thinking damm if this goes wrong in screwed, don&#039;t do it. If you think, well if I don&#039;t get yeah im not happy, but its no real biggy!!!<br /><br />Just use your head. A quick search on the forums will bring up loads on our good friend TJ, loads of real bad negative stuff. If I had bothered to read that first, no way id FE on a bulk order with him!!<br />
