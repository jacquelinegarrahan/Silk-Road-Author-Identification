				i feel as though we need to be more updated on vendors as admins do say things can change in minutes for vendors on SR.<br /><br />im going to start by listing who iv dealt with and my experience`s with the vendors.<br />GOOD REVEIWS....<br /><br />AUSexpress: the name says it this guy likes getting your products to you asap and they are always acceptable, stealth is alright and communication has always been good.. the product itself i have never been able to complain about.<br /><br />aussiegear: good gear, good stealth and communication is unreal, most off all this guy will look after you.....after being ripped off/stuffed around by another vendor....aussiegear helped me rite out, i asked for a few dollars off and he doubled my order as im a valued client off his. also his gear has always been just as good as AUSexpress ;) after him helping me out today iv gotta say i love this vendor.<br /><br />ShardMinister: well this guy seriously does have the best off meth on the road if not i know it is the cleanest. his stealth is beyond what most can do....he cleans his gear to be so clean that there is no head fuck the next day and u might even wake up a little high after your big party!&nbsp; also communication is all good, this is a vendor that is a MUST TRY. <br /><br /><br />BAD REVEIWS:<br /><br />Winta: thought id give this dude a go and iv been fucked over since day 1....i made a order monday for 3 points of shard he said it will go out tuesday express post and he has ignored me since monday also i have not got the package.....2 days ago he entered stealth mode and didnt bother do write back to my messages......i decided to dig around to find out he is know for doing this in the past and atm im not the only one being fucked over others are in resolution with him atm....looks like a %100 refund enless the package turn`s up in 4 days. also he is known for keeping address`s and blackmailing people for a better rating.<br /><br />

				@drgreen sorry to hear about wings, was gonna make a local order with him myself until I started seeing issues come up with his service and product. Hope you can get you cash back. Stick with the only the best. <br /><br />Speaking of the best.. i second the cleanliness and purity of ShardMinister. Easily the best product in Australia hands down. Great price, professional, great communication, quick service and top bloke. The Aussie shard scene needs more vendors like this guy. My personal favourite and recommended for Aussie shard. <br /><br />OzCure - this outfit is quite new but quickly establishing themselves as a serious vendor for all your domestic SR needs. Quick processing time, delivery and communications. Definitely recommended.<br /><br />Crystalburns - Currently out of action due to health reasons bit was up there in the domestic shard food chain. Good product and service. Get well mate. <br /><br />There&#039;s a litany of new vendors out there. Anyone have experience with these guys would be nice to hear.<br /><br />

				iv try`d to find out but winta is still in stealth and is not replying or even looking at the message`s....i really do think he has pissed off... i remember someone did say they think he may have had bad luck with the last batch of meth he was trying to sell as &quot;evaluation required&quot; 1 point $35 so he would off lost out and i guess he could`nt sell what he had left and people were not happy with the product so id say he has done the runner with empty pockets trying to make more paper to get back on the road, BUT after he fucked a few around he is not wanted back and his been BRANDED a little kid trying to sell and fucking us around with hundreds off dollars, very lucky i recovered my full refund after waiting 30 days.......<br /><br /><br />

				^^ thats a best-case scenario. WCS is he unfortunately got busted, hopefully no ones details were compromised.&nbsp; Hope the dude is ok, but a good re-affirmation of why not to FE, esp on large buys, no matter how well established and trusted the vendor.

				I doubt he&#039;s got busted as it&#039;d likely be like that shade guy who got caught and be all over the news if that happened. That and if someone has dodgy selling practices then it&#039;s more likely they&#039;re going to cut and run than the small chance they&#039;ve been caught.

				Speaking of ShardMinister, I&#039;ve put in an order for coke from him (did it over a week ago) and haven&#039;t heard/seen any action on his vendor page etc. since. I see he&#039;s had some earlier issues with fuckheads ripping him off, account hackings and the like, so I&#039;m wondering if he&#039;s having issues like this again now. If so, it&#039;s a shame because I entirely agree with the earlier positive comments about his gear quality - unbelieveable. His coke&#039;s better than any I&#039;ve had, even in Mexico and Amsterdam!!<br />Hope he&#039;s OK. Any clues, anyone?

				Yep, well as negative a reply as yours may sound, T&amp;B, I hate that I have to accept every word of it. No doubt there&#039;s been a rather horrid scenario played out in the guy&#039;s life recently, and it&#039;s a damn shame because he&#039;s the sort of dealer one dreams about, and anyone who dealt with him would count themselves lucky to have done so.<br />Actually, I think the poor bugger has had a string of lame shit dumped on him by complete fuckheads over recent months, including an account hacking and various rip-offs etc etc.<br />Fuck it - looks like resolution time coming shortly - hope I can get my rather sizeable sum of coin back.........

				2StopOZ was just lovely on all levels when they rolled these roads.. Miss nthem heaps and if your lurking here dude I&#039;m thinking about you and sendi ng good luck yojur way as often as I can. Stay safe.<br /><br />CrystalBurns and AusExpress both came through as professional and genuine people in any dealings and comms I have had with them. Each had 1 order not go according to the usual plan but they each dealt with their respective orders problems in a fair, speedy and open way. It left&nbsp; me with a respect for their ethics and way of doing business that wil ensure I have absolute confidence with any furture orders I place with them.<br /><br />Winta I found to be acceptable for the most part because nothing went &#039;haywire&#039; or anything. I found comms with him to be an effort and left me feeling like he had missed my point and/or got defensive and agressive in reply for no reason. I was left feeling like maybe the dude was a hormonal teen or angry young adult but not the &#039;old sscholler&#039; he painted himself up as. I thought that after the last order I had with him was finished I was not going down his silk road&nbsp; again any time soon... then he vanished again.. <br /><br />Now my man the Minister.... this is someone who loves the chemistry behind the gear and was the rarest type of dealer there is... he was able to hold a discussion on things like hydronisation through electrolysis and the various properties and&nbsp; uses for different solvents, salts and the proper digestion of&nbsp; any small lattice structures into larger (more pure too) lattice structures... ;-) Not to mention emergent properties a compound from different reductions and reactions can possess... He had good gear because he enjoyed the learning and the sharing of the results.. He was&nbsp; to dealing what a 4 star chef is to cooks. A prince among men and a good egg all round.. if he is gone for good we are all that much poorer because of it... If your lurking around bruv... got some paper waiting still for you and miss ya brother. touch base on the tormail addy I gave you if your able. At any rate be safe and and keep control of the pleas and muppets...<br /><br />Those who have had any experience with dealing at the retail level while sourcing at the mid wholesale level will understand that its a pace and head space that even the best of the best struggle to maintain for any extended period of time. If your own brain doesn&#039;t get you the letches and fleas will either through ripping you off or just wearing you down with the stupid Little lapses and errors that will end with you being ended and the fun stopping for everyone on the ride with you.... Even the best case in terms of family/friends/quality consistancy with supply and combined with the best mindset on the dealer and maturity and experience behind them has a shelf life of sorts.. SM lasted a long time and is in the top 5% of dealers I have known of or dealt with over the last 2 decades. He is the first online dealer I have dealt with though but I can only imagine what little grounding there is for a traditional dealer may or may not be there with this type of setup...<br /><br />Anyway, come back ASAP minister... you know there is much yet to be done and there isn&#039;t another that can do it in the ranks ATM....<br /><br />Aussiepride did their best but didn&#039;t have quality gear so I moved on to the next...<br /><br />Can&#039;t think of any others at this moment... bed time for this week!! lol..<br /><br />

				Good reply, Hell.<br />It&#039;s clear that SM was good to everyone he had dealings with, and I notice that the rare examples of bad dealings were fairly easily pinned down on the dickheads at the other end being, well, dickheads.<br />I totally recognise also how the life of one who takes on such a stressful, hi-risk activity as dealing (especially Class A illicits) is going to be progressively worn down, and as you say, full creds to the Minister for being on as long as he was, and for maintaining such a high rating. Again, proof of the guy&#039;s professionalism and generosity.<br />Anyway, for all we know, he mightn&#039;t be permanently gone. He might come back. It&#039;s just that a few recent events in his life (and some reflected online even more recently) appear to make things not look to good for the poor fella.<br />Oh yeah - thanks for your other dealer feedback too, mate. Although, I gather you&#039;re talking exclusively about meth? I couldn&#039;t track down a decent Aussie coke thread here, which is why I&#039;ve been using this one.....

				I have found ICEICEICE to be a great vendor, received next day every time i have placed an order. On another note does anybody know of any good international vendors that successfully ship meth to AUS. Would be nice to get some stuff a bit cheaper.

				I can second what slutt is saying about iceiceice, he is very professional, extremely quick turnaround, adequate stealth, and decent quality product. I did notice his pricing increased significantly for larger volume orders and at the top of his vendor page an unspecified apology appeared that was kind of strange, it has since been taken down. Hopefully he continues to have product available.<br /><br />I was going to make a separate post about ozcoldhorse and my experience with him to date but thanks for reviving this thread as it is more appropriate to post here. I placed an order last Wednesday 8/5 paying for express delivery, given the details on his vendor profile I expected this would definitely be dispatched on Thursday for delivery Friday. This did not happen and delivery was not received today 13/5 either, he has not responded to messages but appears to have updated his vendor profile stating that all orders should be received by tomorrow. I will update on this but it is not looking good so far, and there is definitely more to this story with ozcoldhorse. Either he is selling his gear before hes got it, has some kind of scam going on, is totally out of his depth etc etc.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind making small orders with vendors on a trial and error basis, will share both positive and negative experiences without hesitation. Recently I also placed a small order with WhiteRabbitSupply a totally new vendor. Product arrived as expected, stealth was ok BUT the product was 3/4 of the weight it was supposed to be, which is extremely light on, this actually didn&#039;t worry me because in my opinion his gear was shitty anyway and there is no way I would ever pay for it again. Will be interested to see if he persists with Silkroad, I&#039;ll keep my eye out.

				interesting Thread. Any similar reviews about Mdma Vendors?<br /><br />The Sellers that have Caught my eye so far are<br /><br />Aussiegear - Already praised on here for his meth<br /><br />Sydneysfinest - Might as well be sydneys cheapest<br /><br />Dimitry - This guys has very good reviews but he is not cheap...<br /><br />Im more intersted in quality of gear more than anything else. Has anyone bought from the above mentioned sellers or any other aussie domestic vendors could comment on quality?

				Update on ozcoldhorse - nothing received until Thursday 16/5 (ordered 8/5 @ 9am) so this express order took a whole week to arrive, during this time the seller did not respond to any messages. Now when it arrived it was short, the quality of the product is not bad but under the circumstances I doubt I would ever bother ordering from this guy again, the late delivery alone is probably reason enough but the fact it was also short pretty much seals the deal. On a positive note, I do not have to go through any resolution process, choose your vendors wisely!<br /><br />I will be posting a review of all the meth vendors I have dealt with as of mid next week, and post it as a bit of a summary with some kind of standardised method of scoring them, stay tuned anyone who is interested&nbsp; :D

				Aceman123&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />had some awesome MDMA so when/if he re lists I&#039;d try his stuff. His K was lovely too. He is a top human too... a true credit to the road, the scene, the world.... they are actually my regular go to guy for&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my green and have always had the same top shelf service and speed.Competitive pricing and an established account and consistent feedback too.<br /><br />Sydneysfinest&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />is another vendor worth their weight in gold (or meth or molly or charlie... wellll actually... no I stand by that!) Not sure if their MDMA is still listed but they would be someone I would try. I have ordered shard from them a little while back and they made it a pleasure to do business with them by comms second to none, speed that cannot be faulted and good product. Competitive pricing and an established account and consistent feedback too.<br /><br />Sorry to hear of the troubles with OzColdHorse mate... this may sound snobbish but I refuse to do any business with anyone that sells or uses heroin in any way shape or form. They are the reason the term &#039;junkie&#039; exists and for good reason too. Even the strongest and best of the best will have their soul rotted out if they are habitually using opiates.. by simple function they shut our bodies down and eventually they just wast away and less gets started back up.. eventually they are a shell running on a single thought and so everything else falls to the curb... its a progressive degeneration so it will only get worse with them and best case they get on methadone may still be too late.. More than likely just on the nod after spending your cash on hammer... <br /><br />^^just my opinion based on my personal experiences with junkies as customers for weed in a past life and in normal non drug related interactions. IMO H (well anything opiate based really) not a real &#039;recreational&#039; substance by how effective it is as an anesthetic agent which will dull sensations and remove feelings rather than enhance or compliment them any way.^^<br /><br />&#039;I&#039;ve seen the needle and the damage done&#039; Fortunately for me I saw the damage done before I saw the needle way back before even high school and so have avoided it in my 20 odd years of recreational drug use.<br /><br />@Slutt<br /><br />Message when your post count and time here has grown a little more. I know that sounds like a cock thing to say but I hope you can understand the concern I have with furnishing someone with that sort of information both in the forums main and also to someone that I don&#039;t have sufficient observations/understanding of to decide to risk exposing a vendor and perhaps myself. <br /><br />Besides.... the path to the information you seek is before your eyes right now.. after I post THIS message that is....<br /><br />:-)

				lol, pretty bad but not that bad. :p<br />Seems to be about 1.5 - 1.7BTC for 0.25g atm, too poor to check the full gram listings, heh.<br />About 4-5 times the price of the non-aussie vendors.

				Holy shit.&nbsp; $150 USD for a QUARTER GRAM?&nbsp; In America we pay $10 USD a .1.&nbsp; &nbsp;0.25 = $25 USD.&nbsp; Then grams are $75-$80.&nbsp; You guys are paying upwards of $500-$600 a gram.&nbsp; That is totally insane.&nbsp; That would be enough to make me not do drugs.<br /><br />How come Aussies haven&#039;t figured out how to make meth themselves on the island?&nbsp; You can make the stuff in ONE single pop bottle.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you guys legally buy pseudophedrine (in cold pills) in AU?&nbsp; If you can, you guys could be making that shit yourselves with a couple items from your local hardware store.&nbsp; It&#039;s not hard.<br /><br />Read an online book about the 1 bottle cook method.&nbsp; You can easily make a couple grams of meth in a few hours for something like $30.
