				So, I got truly scammed for the first time on SR. Yes I&#039;m a noob and yes, it&#039;s my own fault. I placed two orders from the same vendor. After some issues I clicked the wrong thing at the wrong time and ended up releasing funds on one order and because I was unable to log in at the wrong time, the other auto finalized. It&#039;s been nearly a month and no communication from the vendor. My messages are unread. <br /><br />He did truly get backlogged and had personnel issues. Others got their gear, but mine fell through the cracks and now I&#039;m being ignored.<br /><br />Do I have any recourse? I posted the facts in the review and in his/her discussion thread. Does reporting work? Or did I just lose my money? (Which I realize this is a risk you take and am willing to accept if need be, but would try what I can to salvage.)

				Never FE. It says that on about a million threads on this forum. Keep trying the vendor, if you are legit, but you have no recourse from SR. so, you didn&#039;t check back for 17 days on your product to check delivery? it must have gone from processing to in transit for it to auto finalize. You have missed your chance.

				Since the loot has been released you&#039;re done. Take it as a learning experience and move on. Leave the appropriate feedback though so others can benefit.

				Yes, I normally don&#039;t FE. It was a technical mistake on my part when I was exploring the resolution system. And I did give the vendor the benefit of the doubt for several days, so as far as not logging in for 17 days for the auto finalize? It was more like 2 days at the 15th day of no product being delivered and no communication after an initial bulk letter saying he was backlogged and needed a few extra days.<br /><br />Lessons learned:<br /><br />#1 don&#039;t click stuff unless you know what it does. SR never asks if you&#039;re sure.<br /><br />#2 don&#039;t let orders get below 2 days to auto finalize because you don&#039;t know when you&#039;ll have technical difficulties logging in.<br /><br />Thanks for the responses. All responses to this noob are very appreciated. It&#039;s not what I wanted to hear, but what I expected.

				but at least you learned something. Hopefully you didn&#039;t lose too much.<br /><br /><br />Sh!t people get ripped on the street every day so don&#039;t feel so bad.

				Try not to worry bro, it happens, hope it wasn&#039;t too expensive for you. At least now you know, it won&#039;t happen again.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been lucky, 3 orders, all OK so far. I have FE&#039;d once as it was a seller requirement for newbies, but it turned out OK, but I&#039;m aware I might not be as fortunate if I were to repeat in future.

Seems to be a selective scammer. If all goes as planned things arrive on time. If anything is amiss and needs to be addressed, the policy is to ignore and hope it goes away. I&#039;m not the only one in this predicament with purest. Just in the minority now.<br />
