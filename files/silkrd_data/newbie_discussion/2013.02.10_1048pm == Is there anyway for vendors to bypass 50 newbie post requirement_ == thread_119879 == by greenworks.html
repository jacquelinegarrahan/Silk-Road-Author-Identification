				Hi. Is there anyway a new SR vendor can have an exemption to the 50 newbie posts rule? I&#039;d like to set up an official thread and samples in the Rumor Mill. Would belonging to the Vendor Group allow posting?<br /><br />I&#039;ve searched previous posts, which weren&#039;t definitive on the exact rule.<br /><br />Any help is much appreciated.<br /><br />-greenworks

				Don&#039;t think so. Spend 25 minutes and spam the 50 needed posts. It will be the least of your hurdles as a vendor.

				Unless you&#039;ve been around for a few months and have 35+ transactions, you need to go ahead and do the 50 posts here.

				If a vendor has been around vending for a few months and has 35+ transactions, they can bypass this 50 post requirement.&nbsp; Otherwise, they need to do what everyone else does.<br /><br />However, that&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing because new vendors can still advertise their products here in the Newbie section and start a review thread here so new members can buy &amp; review their products too.

				understandable. Was a bit confusing at first because as a new vendor you want to promote your product on the forums but arent able to post ...but yeah, starting to promote in the newbie section is a good point and makes sense. thanks for your help.

				For sure -- and I understand the confusion/concern.&nbsp; This is a very new policy, so everyone is still getting used to it.<br /><br />The best use of your time in the newbie discussion board is to ask questions, answer questions, and if you are a vendor, start letting people know what you are selling and give new members a place to put their reviews.&nbsp; :)
