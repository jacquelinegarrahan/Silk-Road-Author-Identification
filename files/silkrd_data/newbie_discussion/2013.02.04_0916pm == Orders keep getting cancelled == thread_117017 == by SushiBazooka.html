				Hello all. I&#039;m hoping someone has tips for a newbie to the Silk Road. I&#039;ve twice now attempted to order from two different sellers, and both times had the order cancelled by them with no explanation. I used their public key to encrypt my communications with them at checkout, paid right away, etc., but still they got cancelled. What gives?&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />If anyone has some insight on to what I can do, please let me know!

				It may be because you are new to SR.&nbsp; A lot of sellers require you have so many transactions or spent so many bitcoins before you can buy from them.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t the case with all the vendors.&nbsp; Usually if you click on the vendors&#039; name and read their description they will specify if they have these type of requirements.&nbsp; I suspect the few you have tried do require some transactions already.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp;

				A lot of vendors do not sell to newbee&#039;s.<br />When you have ordered 3 times and asked for your money back from escrow, then it&#039;s obvious.<br /><br />Or if you did fnalize late...<br />Others will not do business with you<br />You will have properly to F.E. just because you are new and nobody is going to be the first to find out if you are to be trusted or not. <br /><br />Keep on trying and pm them for a explanation.

				Okay, thank you for the suggestions.<br /><br />I did look through each seller&#039;s profile and saw nothing about not selling to people below a certain number of transactions. I will attempt to contact each seller individually and ask. <br /><br />Seems like it&#039;s kinda tough to get the ball rolling if nobody is willing to ship to new people. I spent half a day just figuring out how to encrypt things with a public key!

				I&#039;m not at the point yet to start ordering because I&#039;m still waiting on some BTC.<br /><br />The SR wiki recommends establishing some sort of buyer history first.&nbsp; Try purchasing some very cheap digital products. <br /><br />After you got 3 or 5 transactions under your belt.<br /><br />Either that or try contacting the seller before you make a purchase from them to comfirm that they are willing to do business with a newbie.

After 5 transactions most vendors won&#039;t ask for FE anymore.<br />You could buy 5 cheap ebooks to get 5 completed transactions and a few restrictive vendors will sell to you in escrow. But most will see the 5 transactions and less than $5 spent and they get suspicious.<br />The final option is to look for vendors that will allow you to stay in escrow, you just might not be getting the best price anymore.<br /><br />Please remember too, just because you get into escrow doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll get 100% refund if nothing shows up. The average resolution on most vendor profiles seems to be 50% refund or 50% reship.

Some are only ฿0.01&nbsp; ...also, get a few cheap lotto tickets. These range from about ฿1.00 down to as little as ฿0.16<br /><br />As soon as vendors can see you&#039;re serious about being a customer, they won&#039;t cancel your orders.<br /><br />Now, go forth and buy 3 of the cheapest things you can find!

				There are several sellers who don&#039;t require FE for new buyers.&nbsp; UnderGroundSyndicate was the first vendor I purchased from.&nbsp; I know Tessellated accepts first time buyers and never requires FE.&nbsp; Just look around.&nbsp; Sure, when you&#039;re new, you can&#039;t buy from anyone and everyone, but there certainly is still a quality selection available.

				Thanks for all the suggestions, everyone! <br /><br />I found a seller who didn&#039;t cancel my order outright nor ask for an FE. The status has been marked &quot;in transit&quot;, so hopefully soon I&#039;ll have my little order of vyvanse!<br /><br />Thanks again for the tips. I appreciate the help!

				Yup, it&#039;s always a sigh of relief when it comes in the mail lol.&nbsp; And a bit of stress before it does waiting for it everyday and hoping it doesn&#039;t get caught somewhere.<br /><br />If those guys canceled on you, they&#039;re probably not worth giving business to anyhow especially if they didn&#039;t even give you the courtesy of a reason why they canceled.<br /><br />Plenty of other good vendors out there that will appreciate your business.

				I require FE, but I am happy to get orders from newbies as long as they are communicative.&nbsp; I find that when someone takes time to send me a note before they order they are generally better buyers.&nbsp; In this business if you have a buyer and seller openly communicating it eliminates a lot of the issues that can arise.

				Send them a friendly message allways you want to start making business with a new vendor, explain your situation, and wait.<br />You could be asked for FE as a new buyer,you can insist to not FE and see, or FE and take the risk (always with a amount that you can affor to loose)<br />Also with the speed of his answers you will know if this user really cares about you.

				Buy domestic for a few orders from vendors with good reps. As mentioned, buying a few digital goods will increase your purchases count for very little money- but i&#039;m sure vendors can look at your purchase history and see that the the number of transactions versus money spent is low, so maybe don&#039;t buy too many digital products?<br />I made 4 order domestic orders in my first week, 1 didnt require FE, the other 3 did and they all arrived safely.<br />I always messaged the vendor prior to ordering to introduce myself.
