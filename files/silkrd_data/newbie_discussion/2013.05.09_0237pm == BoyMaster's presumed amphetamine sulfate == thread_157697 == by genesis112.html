				Hello everyone.<br /><br />Just want to hear what others have to say about BM&#039;s products. I received 5 g of his amphetamine sulfate the other day, and it was a horrible experience. I am a frequent user of amphetamines, and know what to expect and not. I insufflated 150 mg of BM&#039;s assumed amphetamine, and all I got was an irregular pulse and blurry vision. Tried a few more times, but the effects followed the same pattern. I know for a fact that the product I received can impossibly be amphetamine sulfate. <br /><br />What confuses me the most is how people can say it&#039;s top notch. I mean, he has next to no bad reviews at all, no not a single bad comment about the product. Am I the only one who experienced this, or are people just too nice when they&#039;re handing out reviews? <br /><br />Best regards.

				You would get better responses in the Rumor Mill section. Do a search to see if they have a vendor review thread on the forum. I personally wouldn&#039;t buy from somebody without a decent number of positive reviews.

				Thanks guys.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read his review thread in the rumors mill-section, but the feedback I found was rather old, and outdated. He recently received a new batch, and I haven&#039;t seen any reviews regarding this new batch. The overall feedback was rather bland and uninformative regarding the quality.

				We think one would be fighting off a heart attack at 150mg, unless you had crazy high tolerance to begin with.<br /><br />Try 10mg and see how you feel.

I had about 50mg for first sample of new batch and it was a bit too much for me. Unless I was going out dancing its just a bit too much body energy for me. 10-20mg seems a good dose for this stuff, with option to redose 10-20mg later if required.<br /><br />Kneo<br /><br />To Genesis112, can you comment on how long you were awake for after 150mg?

				Ordered one time from BM, at this time people complained about the &quot;waxyness&quot;. Got some extra with my order, it`s been quite hard to snort, but the quality is top notch and I would die of 150mg at once :)

				BoyMaster is good at shipping to Aus. However my last 2g order gave me less than 1.4g in the actual bag. I like the speed, though. Usually snort about 25mg at a time.<br />My plan is to stick to smoking meth, though. Only problem is that the meth dealers suck balls.

				My order arrived to AUS from BM.<br />I thought his speed was the best I have had for a long long time.<br />I was just having bumps equaling around 10-15mg at a time. Half a gram kept me and my gf up for 2 days. I felt proactive and I got plenty done.<br />I have another 2g on the way, should be here next week. Happy days.<br /><br />@ Electro, I wholeheartedly agree about meth dealers. PM me if you find any reliable ones for AUS shipping.<br />I still haven&#039;t managed to get any shard here. It&#039;s starting to become an expensive exercise. :/
