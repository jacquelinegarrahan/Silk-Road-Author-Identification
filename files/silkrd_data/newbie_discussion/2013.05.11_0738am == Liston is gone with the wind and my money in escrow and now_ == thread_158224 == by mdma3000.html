				I have an order placed at Liston. I asked for a tracker he responded &quot;give me your address&quot; which i did. Day later he said &quot;mail it today&quot; While it was in transit a couple off days. Anyways nothing showed up and asked for tracker no answer after 3 msgs. <br />Today i noticed Liston has left the building.....<br /><br />2 questions<br /><br />1. Money is in escrow do i have to wait till resolve to make the btc available again or???<br />2. Does this happen to other vendors gone 1 day shows up another?<br /><br /><br />

				I believe in all cases you&#039;re required to wait until it enters resolution and then finalizes there. If the vendor has been banned then he won&#039;t be able to respond to the resolution and it will be handed in your favor.<br /><br />If this isn&#039;t accurate I&#039;m sure our beloved scout will clarify for you friend.<br /><br />Laissez-faire!

				He instructed me to go outside of escrow after I asked him for a larger amount.&nbsp; He told me to just do one of his smaller orders and send the rest to him outside of escrow.&nbsp; The order was supposed to be US to US, after two&nbsp; weeks I got a package from another continent and it contained less than a third of what I paid for and was all crushed.&nbsp; I had to weigh the bars to verify even that.<br /><br />I told him.&nbsp; I had been a many time customer of his and he was starting to get sloppy, like marking things in transit 15 minutes after I ordered at 3:00AM and mailing 10 days later, but this time he told me to go to hell.&nbsp; We went to the resolution center and he lost, but still had most of my BC.&nbsp; I told him that since he gave me a 100% refund in the Resolution Center, he should send me the rest back, because that was only fair.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You can see the detailed threats in the customer support thread from a few days ago.<br /><br />Basically he told me to lick his ass and that he would make sure to it that I never got my money back and that if I didn&#039;t leave him alone, he would send a bunch of cocaine to my house in a very suspect package, report the tracking info to the feds, and get me busted.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; He instructed me to pay him outside of escrow (against seller agreement)<br />2.&nbsp; He basically admitted that he was keeping his customer&#039;s info and used that to threaten me with fed pen time for just asking him to give me a refund of money that I deserved.<br /><br />SPECIAL THANKS TO LIBERTAS FOR THE HELP!<br /><br />AND UP YOURS TO ALL THOSE HATERS WHO CALLED ME A LIAR/SCAMMER IN THE FORUMS.<br /><br />As long as you let him neglect to send things in a timely fashion and give him 5/5 after waiting a month and gave him a 5/5 even though you didn&#039;t get your product because &quot;he is a nice guy&quot; or &quot;He assured me it wasn&#039;t his fault&quot;- this is what happens eventually.<br /><br />Look here:<br />Topic: First Resolution Center visit with Liston&nbsp; (Read 56 times)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156984.0<br /><br />Then here:<br />Topic: HELP! Liston threatened having me arressed in SR inbox&nbsp; (Read 55 times)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157097.0<br /><br />Then, after that, go to the search bar here in the forum and type in &quot;liston&quot;.&nbsp; Read my old posts from April 30.&nbsp; You can see that I was ignored, mocked, questioned, and called a liar.<br /><br />Again, if you need help LIBERTAS HAS GOT YOUR BACK!<br /><br />David beat Goliath!<br /><br />I changed to a completely different town&#039;s PO and another PO Box in case he carries out his threat.<br /><br />Just in case he is reading.... Yo Liston, how&nbsp; you like me now, Mate?&nbsp; Was losing your account worth 2 and a half BC?<br /><br />If you are a buyer,&nbsp; please read the rules, including the Seller Agreement! Report ANY vendor that asks you to break them, especially all of these ones that require everyone to FE.&nbsp; That is just the same as going outside of escrow because once you finalize, he could send you a turd dressed up in a Santa costume and you can NEVER GET YOUR MONEY BACK!<br /><br />Yo Liston!&nbsp; Your done son!

				Scout, <br />You are totally right.&nbsp; &nbsp;My bad.<br /><br />Today, he did refund me the rest of the money he had me send outside escrow if I would promise to get him unbanned, along with 500 750 and 1000 bars, depending on how fast I got it done.<br /><br />I told him to go for it, so he sent me my BC back and told me that he would get me the bars when I lifted his ban...<br /><br />Then he offered me a job because he said he needed an East Coast supplier.<br /><br />Sure, I would love to sell drugs for someone who just threatened me with the DEA and looked me up on whitepages.com and had people calling and threatening me at home.<br /><br />I told him to just send me all the bars he had and I would expunge his record and make it appear that he was never banned in the first place.<br /><br />What a dumb jerkoff.&nbsp; I think the wallabies ate all his Xanax.<br /><br />He also told me that he could buy me a plane if he wanted and he was worth 100 billion.<br /><br />Couldn&#039;t he just buy SR and unban himself?<br /><br />Good looking out scout!

				I had an order of 50 with Liston and I never received, it&#039;s five more days until I can push the resolution button and I&#039;m a small time seller who recently got 100 stolen from me; this is really hurting right now. I can&#039;t message Liston bc he has been banned and not responding to his emails except to ask for my address so he can tell me the expected delivery date (which now has me worried with everything I&#039;ve been reading) but I doubt I&#039;ll be receiving anything since it has been way past his estimated delivery time. Is there anything I can do? The funds should still be in escrow. Email me at mydyingfaith@tormail.org. Any advice or guidance will be greatly appreciated because I feel cheated. I just put in an order with Bionik who I have had success with in the past but freeing up Liston&#039;s escrow would help greatly getting more orders out the sooner the better because the semester is over and I&#039;m going to be fucked.

				Liston is a narc and scammer.&nbsp; Read the link<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160901.0<br /><br />Libertas and Scout helped me get him banned by contacting SR Admin and telling me how to report him and to tell them to read my emails.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the SR Admins agenda is, maybe just money, but as for Libertas and Scout, they are here to help, they helped me and didn&#039;t call me a liar or otherwise, they just told me if what I was saying was true and they could read the emails about him saving customer info, they thought he would be banned, and they were right.<br /><br />Libertas and Scout,<br /><br />How can an admitted Narc who admits to keeping customer info an then make threats that I will not rehash, simply redeem himself with 500 bucks.&nbsp; He admitted to keeping info so people like me who complain could be stfu and scared away.&nbsp; I just went to another PO and opened another box and told him that and he still got me busted with customers sending to my old address.&nbsp; Can you&nbsp; do whatever you want and pay to get back on an they take money over ethics?<br /><br />Once again, thanks for advice/guidance/help in this matter.
