				Hello everyone,<br />regarding to the problems with the safety of Tor and the NSA in the neck, I found an interview with someone which is involved in something called &quot;enigmabox&quot;.<br />The link is in german language only till yet. - enigmabox.net<br /><br />They say you can telephone with it and surf, but its all encrypted they say and keys are temporaly, by uing Perfect Forward Secrecy.<br />It uses &quot;cjdns&quot; for encrypted IPv6 meshnetwork.<br />The exit-servers are in hungary, the AstraServer and in france the OVH.<br />They also talk about using Tor with it. They say, if Tor has again problems with the anonymity, the only thing which would show up, is the IP adress of their servers.<br /><br />I followed the discussion in &quot;safety&quot;, with kmfw.. talking about some resolutions, what sounded very good and I think he mentioned something about Mesh-networks.<br />Maybe someone with more understanding of the matter could read through the text of the webpage and give some more info.. maybe translate it.<br /><br />would this be a possibiltiy? it costs 10€ a month for phoning and surfing.<br />The box itself costs about 300€ and they deliver worldwide, accepting bitcoins, too.<br />I saw an interview with a developer on alpenparlament.tv.<br />what do you think of it??<br /><br />Hope someone takes a minute for that! <br />
