				Here is the actual email I just received:<br />This is a worst case fucking NIGHTMARE!<br /><br />New Rules <div>Fromastonmarteensr (astonmarteensr@tormail.org)(http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/roundcube/skins/larry/images/addcontact.png) (http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/roundcube/?_task=mail&amp;_action=show&amp;_uid=23&amp;_mbox=INBOX#add)Tolasvegasjuly1999 (lasvegasjuly1999@tormail.org)(http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/roundcube/skins/larry/images/addcontact.png) (http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/roundcube/?_task=mail&amp;_action=show&amp;_uid=23&amp;_mbox=INBOX#add)DateSat 08:35</div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Message 3 of 25 &lt; &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I got some new rules for you. Check this out: REAL ADDRESS GIVEN HERE I got all the information I need. Aaron, Cynthia, Beth, Kelly Ann. Oh look what I found: (XXX) XXX-XXXX&nbsp; REAL PHONE NUMBER HERE And why&#039;d you change the name from [REMOVED] to REAL NAME GIVEN HERE or is it your mothers name? Now you see I got all your fucking information. Let me tell you what you&#039;re gonna do first thing in the morning: 1) Go to https://www.bitinstant.com (https://www.bitinstant.com) 2) Click Cash Deposit to Bitcoin Address 3) This is the address you&#039;re sending to: 1GkgHadKxLDtNYmk6QNbSWgX4qFFQ72z69 4) Amount is $500 5) Go to Walmart/CVS wherever and do the cash deposit. If you don&#039;t pay me $500 in BITCOIN tomorrow morning, I&#039;m talking fucking 9 am. If you don&#039;t pay me $500 in BTC, I&#039;m gonna ruin your motherfucking life son. I got all your transaction history, I got all your communication. I&#039;ll put half an ounce of coke in the mail and mail it to your house, and right after I mail it I&#039;ll call up the USPS, the [REMOVED] police, the DEA and the FBI and tip them off about your address. And you wont be able to do SHIT to stop that :) Once it&#039;s in the mail, and If I make that call, they will grab your package at the post office. I will also email the local cops through tor with copies of your transactions and on which dates you&#039;ve recived packages in the past. They will check with USPS and verify, and youll be on the news. You&#039;ll be a celebrity motherfucker. You&#039;ll be the first silk road arrest ever made. Also, if the $500 in BITCOIN isnt there, aside from what I mentioned, I will plater your information, address, phone number,&nbsp; relatives names, address, phone numbers allover the Silk road forums, the atlantis forums, the BMR forums. So anyone who googles REAL NAMES AND EMAILS GIVEN HERE (REMOVED) or that website your family had..all your names and numbers and addresses will pop up on the drug forums, forever. You can try to report me, but that wont mean shit bro. This conversation is happening throuhg tormail.. and thats where you fucked up :) And I&#039;ll keep making new accounts and blasting your personal information on the forums all day every day. In fact I&#039;ll even put it on the child porn forums and say you are a child porn trafficker. If th FBI doesn&#039;t get your ass, some anti child porn dude will blow up your fucking house. WELCOME TO YOUR NIGHTMARE MOTHERFUCKER. This isn&#039;t blackmail, brother. This is your only fucking option. I&#039;m holding your LIFE in my hands right now. $500 through BITINSTANT tomorrow morning to : 1GkgHadKxLDtNYmk6QNbSWgX4qFFQ72z69 Or I fuck your life up forever. BUT if you pay the $500 in Bitcoin.. I will back off. You understand me loud and fucking clear? &nbsp; &nbsp; I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO SR <br />WHAT ELSE SHOULD I DO?<br /><br />He has emailed me more and indicated he started a thread ABOUT ME??

				Thank him for the nice free half ounce of coke. What a nice guy.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br />Thanks for letting us know who this guy really is, also, remind him you have copies of this message and any attempt to further blackmail you and threaten your mother will result in him ending up in jail since you have proof yourself you bought drugs from him and have no trouble doing time if it means he&#039;ll go down too. Remind him as well, in the United States(if this is where you live) You have a right to confront your accuser.

				Thanks Scout!<br />I have already reported him as well since he told me to.<br />It is not that bad for me because I was using a neighbors address. It will be interesting to see what the DEA and FBI, etc.. do from a safe distance (I can see the mailbox from my living room). <br />Friends from across the street will have a big surprise though. <br />Can you imagine them getting home from vacation and being met with that!<br /><br />I just received a death threat from him to take this Post down or he&#039;s gonna kill me.

				Just received a death threat if I don&#039;t remove this thread.<br />I know SR Advises to use your real information for Shipping. But can you imagine the consequences in this case if I had!<br />He is threatening me with info that means shit to me! Notre Dame was the last one (I guess someone at that address went to Notre Dame University.)<br />He will more than likely send his half ounce of cocaine and call the DEA. <br />I hope he does it before the addressee&#039;s come back from vacation because we live in such a rural area and the postman is my best friend! I could see the DEA from a mile away. Bet I could retrieve it and make it home before the DEA could even start down the road. LOL<br />

				What is the back story? why is he doing this in the first place...<br /><br />Honestly, Id recommend paying him. 500 is cheap, also change up your account wallet address mailing address name etc. after all this is said and done. <br /><br />Best wishes and good luck sincerely.<br /><br />

				I can tell everyone what set him off. Last night he put a thread in the newbie forum that said SR is down but I am still here doing business. I contacted him and he wanted me to do a transaction outside of SR. I told him that I wanted to do the deal (was a phenomenal deal) but would have to wait till the road was back up cause I needed escrow etc... The road came back up and I placed the items in my cart.<br />When finalizing the deal (paying for it) the road became unaccessible again.<br />I told him to check on his end to see if it was there. He could no longer access the road. My last communication with him said. &quot;I can&#039;t ship unless I get paid&quot; He wanted me to pay him again outside of the road and he would refund (cancel) MY TRANSACTION when the road came back up.<br />I told him I had no other wallet than SR. If they are down, I am down. He said he couldn&#039;t ship until verification I had paid. (completely understandable)<br />I WENT TO BED and logged on tonight to all this.<br />He hasn&#039;t shipped anything anyways (unless he still had my neighbors address from previous transactions). At least he hasn&#039;t said he shipped anything. Why would he need to ship another package (the half ounce of coke) TO fuck me over with if he had shipped something already.<br />I can only order at two different addresses (never at my own because of situations like this) And can only order when they go out of town.<br />If he shipped something then TELL ME THAT. I pay what I owe. But he&#039;s not saying that. If you read his messages he says pay me 500 to keep me from fucking you over.<br />Did you ship something ASTONMARTEEN?<br />DO I OWE YOU $500? If ao, I will gladly pay. <br />I said I can&#039;t do it outside of SR he said he can&#039;t do it till the road comes back up to verify payment<br />SO&nbsp; I WENT TO BED.<br />WTF<br />Honestly, If something did show up I would gladly pay him. <br />

				I think he placed the thread in the forums trolling for someone to fuck over outside of SR. He has not contacted me once via SR.<br />He doesn&#039;t have shit on me outside of a neighbors address. Even if he did ship something to that address. I AINT GONNA FUCKIN RETRIEVE IT!

				A think sending someone a half ounce of coke is like 1400 dollars. So if you don&#039;t pay him, he&#039;s going to mail you drugs? <br /><br />Seems legit. <br /><br />

				Don&#039;t worry, he has nothing on you. Even if he had your real address he could do nothing serious without the thing firing back anyway.<br />It is just an attempt to scare you so you give him the money.<br /><br />However these sort of people gamble themselves, you never know who you are going to piss off (there are things much worse than even death in this world).

				I know someone who has had dealings( through SR) with astonmarteen, He seems, my opinion.. that he is very insecure, I could tell by the reaction he gave from what my friend told him about his product. Very unstable on the edge, and He has been bashed by customers on several occasions over his quality. I think he may have snapped, Its really a scarey thing. WOW. How do you react to something like that,....

				You all wanted my attention.. and now you got it.<br /><br />Let me start this with a quote from Paradise Lost. &quot;Abashed the Devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is&quot;<br /><br />I have walked the earth with you mortals for too long. And I&#039;ve seen and done too much. For God, country, and man. I spent 8 years in special services doing things for this country that would make most people cringe. I&#039;ve been in the fog of war and been fired upon by women and children. I&#039;ve made very shocking decisions on the battlefield. Government discharged me honorable and I had no means. And started vending. And make a good lot of money doing it. I will NOT tolerate insubordination. I will NOT tolerate playing around on my watch. My employees know it. They&#039;re well compensated. 1 employee of mine though it fit to steal from my operation. I didn&#039;t confront him, I didn&#039;t accuse him, I didn&#039;t cast an evil eye on him. No. I took my loaded Glock 17 and put it to the back of his head and put 2 rounds through him. And my other employees knew to never, ever, EVER fuck with me again.<br /><br />I am a no nonsense gentleman. And I see some very, VERY! disturbing allegations here. The main allegation is by a crack addict keeps babbling some nonsense about neighbors and DEA and what not. I see others have chimed in to insult me too. Well well, is taking me on, really that smart?<br /><br />Aston Mother Fucking Marteen.

Or is that your mothers name?<br />Now you see I got all your fucking information. Let me tell you what you&#039;re gonna do first thing in the morning:<br /><br />1) Go to https://www.bitinstant.com<br />2) Click Cash Deposit to Bitcoin Address<br />3) This is the address you&#039;re sending to: 1GkgHadKxLDtNYmk6QNbSWgX4qFFQ72z69<br />4) Amount is $500<br />5) Go to Walmart/CVS wherever and do the cash deposit.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t pay me $500 in BITCOIN tomorrow morning, I&#039;m talking fucking 9 am. If you don&#039;t pay me $500 in BTC, I&#039;m gonna ruin your motherfucking life son. I got all your transaction history, I got all your communication. I&#039;ll put half an ounce of coke in the mail and mail it to your house, and right after I mail it I&#039;ll call up the USPS, the Estill Springs police, the DEA and the FBI and tip them off about your address. And you wont be able to do SHIT to stop that :) Once it&#039;s in the mail, and If I make that call, they will grab your package at the post office. I will also email the local cops through tor with copies of your transactions and on which dates you&#039;ve recived packages in the past. They will check with USPS and verify, and youll be on the news. You&#039;ll be a celebrity motherfucker. You&#039;ll be the first silk road arrest ever made.<br /><br />Also, if the $500 in BITCOIN isnt there, aside from what I mentioned, I will plater your information, address, phone number, relatives names, address, phone numbers allover the Silk road forums, the atlantis forums, the BMR forums. So anyone who googles REAL NAME GIVEN HERE or REAL EMAIL GIVEN HERElexy27613@yahoo.com or that website your family had..all your names and numbers and addresses will pop up on the drug forums, forever. You can try to report me, but that wont mean shit bro. This conversation is happening throuhg tormail.. and thats where you fucked up :) And I&#039;ll keep making new accounts and blasting your personal information on the forums all day every day. In fact I&#039;ll even put it on the child porn forums and say you are a child porn trafficker. If th FBI doesn&#039;t get your ass, some anti child porn dude will blow up your fucking house.<br /><br />WELCOME TO YOUR NIGHTMARE MOTHERFUCKER. This isn&#039;t blackmail, brother. This is your only fucking option. I&#039;m holding your LIFE in my hands right now. $500 through BITINSTANT tomorrow morning to : 1GkgHadKxLDtNYmk6QNbSWgX4qFFQ72z69<br /><br />Or I fuck your life up forever.

You understand me loud and fucking clear? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />it&#039;s the exact same message this person is claiming to have gotten complete with the same wallet address.

You really just used that dated phrase? With all due respect Mr. Libertas.. you are not the principal of a boys academy that I am a pupil of. I understand you&#039;re newfound status as a moderator might be an exciting period in your life.. but do not speak to me like that. I have never threatened anyone veiled or otherwise. Why would I threaten a customer? Now, if a customer is messaging me in all caps in a crack cocaine induced frenzy and screaming and yelling, I will tell him to shut his fucking crackhead mouth. That&#039;s my right, and I love that I&#039;m able to exercise it. If my &quot;jets&quot; werent &quot;cooled&quot;.. then it would be bad. And I don&#039;t want things to be bad, I like things being good. When I was on the ground in Kandahar, a local contractor who was helping us with logistics kept direspecting me. And I ignored it, knowing it was a local custom to speak loudly etc. But then he kept doing it, after I politely requested he back off. He didnt. So I simply grabbed his face and picked him up a few inches off the ground by his neck (literally like in the cartoons) and squeezed until his gasps turned into silence. Sure I was reprimanded by my CO, but it was worth. I&#039;m a reasonable man. I&#039;ve a fantastic, thriving business selling drugs. I don&#039;t need this crackfiend&#039;s $500 dollars.. I really don&#039;t. He is apparently a troll or desperate for attention.. which you people have given him. That being said, I LOOK FORWARD to an investigation by SR. They can have access to all my communications. They will see this nutcase is just trying to create a raucous because he didn&#039;t get his 8ball of crack during the site&#039;s down period. I&#039;m sorry OP, I&#039;m sorry you didn&#039;t get your crack fix. But that&#039;s not my problem sir. I don&#039;t control the site. I didn&#039;t send you any message demanding money or threatening to call the the cops or anything. That is so silly that it borderlines on farce.<br /><br />One thing though. A crackhead on the forum can start a thread tarning the rep of an established vendor without any reprecussion.. yet some two bit moderator with 1 week under his belt is telling me to &quot;cool&quot; my &quot;jets&quot;? This man is spreading FUD against me and my business, and I demand it stop.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t ever release a buyers information here or anywhere. I don&#039;t even save buyer information past mailing. No need for it. The OP has lost his marbles and is concocting stories in his crack fueled paranoia.. but please don&#039;t bring me into your hallucinations you whiny little motherfucker. <br /><br />Mr Libertas -&nbsp; I see the penalties for vendors threatening a buyer are grave. As they should. What, good sir, would be the penalties to a buyer hurling insanities at a vendor of good standing? <br /><br />I am a drug dealer, I am heavily armed, and I am trained by the state to be a lethal, cold hearted bastard. But I don&#039;t play around when it comes to my business.. and I don&#039;t tolerate others playing around with my business either.<br /><br />IN REGARDS TO LIARS: Levicitus 20:13 &quot;If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death.&quot;<br /><br />Under-fucking-stood?

				Oh my dear little Scout. I expected more from your soldier. I expected atleast a cursory glance at my vendor feedback before believing what others have said. On your knees and give me 20!!! Well just kidding. But, in all seriousness. Please check your facts Private Scout. There is *NO* message/feedback pertaining to ANY kind of &quot;blackmai&quot; or anything else of a sily message on my vendor page what so ever. Not even one. Go look yourself. <br /><br />I expected more from Scout before demanding I explain something that doesn&#039;t exist on my vendor page. Will be a negative mark in your file, soldier. Check my page, and then come back and here apologize if said &quot;message&quot; is not on there. (Which it is most certainly not!)<br /><br />A little reminder to those who like to spread FUD..<br /><br />Deuteronomy 14:6-7&nbsp; You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud. However, of those that chew the cud or that have a split hoof completely divided you may not eat the camel, the rabbit, or the coney.

This has already been sent up the chain to administrators so I believe it would be in both your interests to &#039;cool your jets&#039; in terms of threats and accusations until the situation has been adjudicated upon.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;Cool my jets&quot;? You really just used that dated phrase? With all due respect Mr. Libertas.. you are not the principal of a boys academy that I am a pupil of. I understand you&#039;re newfound status as a moderator might be an exciting period in your life.. but do not speak to me like that. I have never threatened anyone veiled or otherwise. Why would I threaten a customer? Now, if a customer is messaging me in all caps in a crack cocaine induced frenzy and screaming and yelling, I will tell him to shut his fucking crackhead mouth. That&#039;s my right, and I love that I&#039;m able to exercise it. If my &quot;jets&quot; werent &quot;cooled&quot;.. then it would be bad. And I don&#039;t want things to be bad, I like things being good. When I was on the ground in Kandahar, a local contractor who was helping us with logistics kept direspecting me. And I ignored it, knowing it was a local custom to speak loudly etc. But then he kept doing it, after I politely requested he back off. He didnt. So I simply grabbed his face and picked him up a few inches off the ground by his neck (literally like in the cartoons) and squeezed until his gasps turned into silence. Sure I was reprimanded by my CO, but it was worth. I&#039;m a reasonable man. I&#039;ve a fantastic, thriving business selling drugs. I don&#039;t need this crackfiend&#039;s $500 dollars.. I really don&#039;t. He is apparently a troll or desperate for attention.. which you people have given him. That being said, I LOOK FORWARD to an investigation by SR. They can have access to all my communications. They will see this nutcase is just trying to create a raucous because he didn&#039;t get his 8ball of crack during the site&#039;s down period. I&#039;m sorry OP, I&#039;m sorry you didn&#039;t get your crack fix. But that&#039;s not my problem sir. I don&#039;t control the site. I didn&#039;t send you any message demanding money or threatening to call the the cops or anything. That is so silly that it borderlines on farce.<br /><br />One thing though. A crackhead on the forum can start a thread tarning the rep of an established vendor without any reprecussion.. yet some two bit moderator with 1 week under his belt is telling me to &quot;cool&quot; my &quot;jets&quot;? This man is spreading FUD against me and my business, and I demand it stop.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t ever release a buyers information here or anywhere. I don&#039;t even save buyer information past mailing. No need for it. The OP has lost his marbles and is concocting stories in his crack fueled paranoia.. but please don&#039;t bring me into your hallucinations you whiny little motherfucker. <br /><br />Mr Libertas -&nbsp; I see the penalties for vendors threatening a buyer are grave. As they should. What, good sir, would be the penalties to a buyer hurling insanities at a vendor of good standing? <br /><br />I am a drug dealer, I am&nbsp; and I am trained by the state to be a lethal, cold hearted bastard. But I don&#039;t play around when it comes to my business.. and I don&#039;t tolerate others playing around with my business either.<br /><br />IN REGARDS TO LIARS: Levicitus 20:13 &quot;If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.

I am a trained weapon of the state machinery. I was honorably discharged. I&#039;ve got enough shrapnel in me to set off metal detectors when going through airports. I&#039;ve given my LIFE to God and Country. And I certainly, CERTAINLY will not be taunted by the likes of you, sir. Under-motherfucking-stood?<br /><br />An interesting thing happened today. I was grilling myself a steak for lunch. And 1 of the steaks was undercooked. I think I forgot to grill it for more then a minute. It was beyond rare. It was literally bleeding, dripping blood of the cow. For a second I thought &quot;oh, I should cook it a little more&quot;. But then a voice in my head told me to try it as is, I might enjoy the taste. You know what happened next? I did. I ate it. I loved it completely rare and raw. Dripping in its natural red juices. It satisfied me. It really, satisfied me in a way that even the loins of a woman couldn&#039;t. You understand, son?<br /><br />Matthew 6:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful not to do your ‘acts of righteousness’ before men, to be seen by them.

I&#039;m not saying that is what happened here, but I&#039;m really questioning this 29 day old review by the same person! It doesn&#039;t make sense!!!<br /><br />Here is the link to the purchase review, and as you can see it is 29 days old!

				I&#039;ve just spent a while scanning through AstonMarteen&#039;s vendor page - And I believe the person who made this thread is full of shit and AshtonMarteen is owed an apology.<br /><br />It&#039;s clear when you investigate the situation further that lasvegasboy is trying to fuck up Aston&#039;s vendor status for some reason.<br /><br />I believe Aston is 100% telling the truth and everyone&#039;s believed the OP with very little credible evidence. Do yourselves a favor and study Aston&#039;s vendor page - 29 days ago precisely!!!

				It&#039;s odd that almost all of the feedback left on astonmarteen&#039;s vendor page (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1fd25f5dc6/) is agreeable, if not exemplary, until you come across lasvegasjuly1999&#039;s 1/5 (a copy of the mailed &quot;ultimatum&quot;), left 29 days ago and currently on the sixth page of reviews. I have to question lasvegasjuly1999&#039;s side of the story and whether he has twisted things a bit here to make himself sound more innocent in the face of astonmarteen&#039;s &quot;ultimatum&quot;, or indeed fabricated the whole thing completely. It&#039;s hard to believe that astonmarteen would just go off the wall to this one guy a month or so ago for an apparently trivial reason and then continue vending and have 50-odd functional transactions with others since, receiving positive feedback. Clouseau out.<br /><br />Astonmarteen, you don&#039;t help yourself by appearing to be batshit insane. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re just trying to have a laugh but it&#039;s probably not too sensible when your rep is on the line.<br /><br />...Of course, this whole situation could be fabricated by the same guy for shits and giggles. I&#039;ve certainly sniggered to myself sadistically reading through this thread. Astonmarteen is like a fucking caricature.

It&#039;s hard to believe that astonmarteen would just go off the wall to this one guy a month or so ago for an apparently trivial reason and then continue vending and have 50-odd functional transactions with others since, receiving positive feedback. Clouseau out.<br /><br />Astonmarteen, you don&#039;t help yourself by appearing to be batshit insane. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re just trying to have a laugh but it&#039;s probably not too sensible when your rep is on the line.<br /><br />...Of course, this whole situation could be fabricated by the same guy for shits and giggles. I&#039;ve certainly sniggered to myself sadistically reading through this thread. Astonmarteen is like a fucking caricature.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. SANITY prevails.<br /><br />WHY ON EARTH would i jeopardize a near perfect vending record to snap and demand $500 (I make 6 times that on a good day) from this crack addict? And start threatening to attack him and his neighbors and God knows what else? I may be insane, but I&#039;m not crazy!<br />He pulled this same stunt earlier and then just rehashed his lunacy again. This time on the forums. And I wasn&#039;t having it. <br />Either he wants free crack, sympathy, to affect my reputation, or attention. Or all of the above. I&#039;m glad people are smart enough to see this stupid motherfucker for what he is. A hilarious little lunatic, yelling and screaming demanding free crack, bragging about his incestuous relationship with his mother (yes, he even sent me a PM referencing something about tapping his own mother&#039;s ass. I will reproduce it here for all to see) and I got stern with him and told him to shut his mouth and talk to me with respect. And then he re-hashes some old attempt to slander me. <br /><br />Thank you to the gentlemen who can put 2 and 2 together. Shame on the moderators who were so quick to cast judgement upon me. <br />2 Bitcoins to you TOO for being sensible. PM me a wallet.<br /><br />AM

				The whole situation is sketchy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen now at least three different email addresses given by AstonMarteen ... and claims of an ex-partner who is angry ... and now these users who see that he&#039;s giving away 2 BTC to people who will side with him ... <br /><br />Just so everyone knows - though it should be obvious - not everyone with PTSD from wartime acts like this vendor does.&nbsp; PTSD from war doesn&#039;t usually cause people to develop a penchant for jugular-gnawing and raw-meat-eating and shooting people in the back of the head.&nbsp; That is the result of something entirely unrelated to wartime / PTSD!<br /><br />His stories are entertaining to imagine though.

				I agree that there is definitely more to the story - but neither the vendor nor the OP seem to be telling the whole story.&nbsp; It is important to understand that a claim from ANYONE who says they are in the midst of being blackmailed by a vendor is something that SR takes VERY seriously for obvious reasons.

				Well, I&#039;d say people should be cautious about buying from this vendor even just based on the vendor&#039;s feedback.&nbsp; Several people reported that the crack was packaged in a ziploc cut in half without even being sealed, and multiple people reported that the crack spilled all over during transit and was stuck in the tape of the package, etc.&nbsp; Another one or two claim never to have received their orders.

				Aston said he gave 2 people 2 bitcoin each.<br /><br />What Astonmarteen needs is a new vendor account and 4 bitcoin is almost enough for the bond for a new vendor account. There is no way he sent out 4 bitcoin to people just for coming to his defense in this thread.

				AstonMarteen: You may not have blackmailed anyone, but at least I don&#039;t care about that anymore. The major concern here is that you&#039;re obviously a huge moron with major mental health issues, and no one should buy from or have anything to do with you ever. If you ever intended to have a stable business on SR, you fucked up big time coming on this forum acting like a complete idiot of biblical (lol) dimensions.<br /><br />You can threat and quote the bible all you want, but all I see is a child having a temper tantrum. You may be a dangerous drug dealer and all that, but that doesn&#039;t mean shit here. You are pathetic.

				For me civilian life is nothing! In the field we had a code of honor, you watch my back, I watch yours. Back here there&#039;s nothing! Back there I could fly a gunship, I could drive a tank, I was in charge of million dollar equipment, back here I can&#039;t even hold a job *parking cars*!<br /><br />We were in this bar in Saigon and this kid comes up, this kid carrying a shoe-shine box. And he says &quot;Shine, please, shine!&quot; I said no. He kept askin&#039;, yeah, and Joey said &quot;Yeah.&quot; And I went to get a couple of beers, and the box was wired, and he opened up the box, fucking blew his body all over the place. And he&#039;s laying there, he&#039;s fucking screaming. There&#039;s pieces of him all over me, just...like this, and I&#039;m tryin&#039; to pull him off, you know, my friend that&#039;s all over me! I&#039;ve got blood and everything and I&#039;m tryin&#039; to hold him together! I&#039;m puttin&#039;... the guy&#039;s fuckin&#039; insides keep coming out! And nobody would help! Nobody would help! He&#039;s saying, sayin&#039; &quot;I wanna go home! I wanna go home!&quot; He keeps calling my name! &quot;I wanna go home, Johnny! I wanna drive my Chevy!&quot; I said &quot;With what? I can&#039;t find your fuckin&#039; legs! I can&#039;t find your legs!&quot;

				This is a bunch of BS...astonmarteen blackmailed no one....IF PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THE TIME to actually READ, they would see that the message sent to the poster of this BS thread, VEGAS1999, was sent from ASTONMARTEENSR, not astonmarteen....it is an obvious attempt to ruin a good vendor. There is no reasoning behind the blackmail and I&#039;m sure a vendor making over 5 grand a week needs to blackmail someone for $500 bucks. ....I don&#039;t know any drug dealers who call the fucking DEA, cops, etc. for $500 bucks, do you???!!!
