				I dont know anyone else personally who uses SR. Kinda weird. A lot of my friends know about it but have no idea about the whole Tor browser and shit. And i know a lot of drug dealers/users so I find this surprising.

				Now that you mention it, yeah none of my friends know of Tor, deep web, SR, hell even bitcoins as far as I know except for a few that I introduced all of the above to. But I don&#039;t think they go on SR either, they just have alot of drug dealer friends for drug connections. I&#039;m excited about SR though having rolled recently for the first time lol.

				I haven&#039;t had anyone tell me directly that he uses SR, but a couple of dealers have made reference to getting drugs in the mail, so it seems likely. At the same time, people were sending drugs in the mail for years before SR existed, so who knows? As a general rule, I keep my mouth shut about it. Part of the reason- I&#039;ll be honest- is wanting to be the only one who knows about it so I can be THE MAN when it comes to having all the good hook ups. But part of the reason is just feeling that the fewer stoned teenagers there are running their mouths about SR the better. Loose lips sink ships and all that.<br /><br />Hope this ship never sinks!

				I&#039;ve told my friends about it but most seem to think it&#039;s some sort of gimmick or fantasy of mine haha. They&#039;ve somehow got this idea that it would never work because the sniffer dogs would smell it. They don&#039;t grasp the concept that not every piece of mail is thoroughly inspected lmao. It&#039;s sort of annoying because I know if they took the time to research it and actually find out how it works, they&#039;d love it.

				i&#039;d be too worried that somebody would try something stupid like intercepting my mail if they had an idea i was getting shit thru the mail. i&#039;ve seen people try way more desperate things irl deals, so i don&#039;t think it being too paranoid.

				i know rite. my mailbox is outside as well. if for some reason i couldn&#039;t be there for the delivery it would be way too easy for somebody to go and help themselves. also we used to steal the postman&#039;s bike years ago for the CC&#039;s, so i&#039;m fully aware how easy that would be.

				The less people that know about SR the better. If most of my friends knew then I&#039;d be out of business but I guess they are computer illiterate and have no idea where to start in terms of finding it or actually getting spendable money along with using encryption. Scare tactics work quite well to keep them at bay, I can buy for them ;)

				I don&#039;t see much harm in letting people know SR exists. LE must be fully aware of its existence and what that implies. However, I tend not to let people know where I get my drugs from just in case they ever wanted to fuck me over.

				you should also consider that if somebody knows you&#039;re ordering on here and they get arrested and the cops start putting it on them for info, then they may just mention it to them. the cops could then start targeting all post sent to your addy.

				Someone just put me on a while back, after we had indeph convo about the local dealers always ripping ya off and no loyalty anymore so I was going to step outta of the game as I was taking to many losses.&nbsp; My buddy says ima put you on to something that will change your life and money situation very quickly only catch don&#039;t tell nobody else and don&#039;t sell physcadelics I was def with it.&nbsp; And I wouldn&#039;t tell anybody anyhow why make myself more competition when I can have the best prices and best product around.&nbsp; I always thought my buddy got his shit elsewhere ot or something and we been peoples for awhile and I must say he lives quite nicely off SR with a bullshit part time job.&nbsp; This is one secret that&#039;s staying with me as the more people that know the harder it gets to run smoothly to many people are careless and have big mouths.
