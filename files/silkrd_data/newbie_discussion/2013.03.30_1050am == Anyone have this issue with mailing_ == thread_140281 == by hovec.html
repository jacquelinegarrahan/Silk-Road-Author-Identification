				Well first off I&#039;m new to silk road. So I did as was recommended and started with a small order. Ordered 1 gram of MDMA shipped to my parents place US to US to test the waters..<br /><br />Anyway, 1 week later I call my mother to see if any mail arrived for me. She says &quot;we don&#039;t get mail to our house&quot; :l So she explains that there was mail stolen from mailboxes in the neighborhood yadayadayada and they switched to a P.O. Box and had all mail to their home stopped. She says that mail gets forwarded to their PO box that is sent to their home address but i&#039;m weary because its Saturday and the sender said the order should arrive Thursday.. Has anyone ever had experience with something like this? Starting to wonder if my package will be lost in the mail.. Maybe I should chalk ot up as a loss and have a new order shipped to the PO box. Anyone who is knowledgeable with how the USPS works that could answer?
