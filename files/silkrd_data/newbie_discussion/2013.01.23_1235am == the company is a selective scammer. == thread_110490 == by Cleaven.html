				The Company is the name of one of the vendors. <br /><br />There is many who advise against FE, please consider not FE-ing again.&nbsp; Suggest sending another PM to The Company.&nbsp; It could be simply an oversight and they missed one of your messages.&nbsp;

				I was told the same thing about wanting me to fe after putting in a order. They said it was due to me being newbie w/o buyer stats. I responded back to them letting them know I didn&#039;t want to fe and I asked to cancel my order and get a refund. Later that day it was returned to my account.&nbsp; Thanks TC

				Thanks for sharing the warning. It certainly is a choice we have to make since some vendors require FE under certain circumstances. You got to check the feedback and decide if it&#039;s worth the risk to deal with that vendor. At least now I know not to order from The Company.

				Problem is it has just become the usual for a lot of vendors. Putting too much power in the vendors hands and absolutley none in the buyers, Especially when you can never know for sure if the item was sent or not

				I think the escrow system is great protection for buyers and SR obviously wouldn&#039;t be so awesome without it. I encourage the us of the escrow system, but I have to say that the only case FE should be done is if you are a new buyer buying untracked items. You should go with a tracked item and refuse to FE. Personally, I won&#039;t use escrow with buyers that are very new unless they choose a tracked shipping method. I wish I was able to offer untracked mail with escrow for new buyers, but the risk is too high.

				If you are in the USA, tracked items do not always require a signature.&nbsp; You can track an item through First Class Parcel, Priority Shipping, and Express (all throught USPS).&nbsp; With Express, the vendor has to remember to mark it to require no signature.&nbsp; FC Parcel and Priority are an extra cost to track, but worth it.
