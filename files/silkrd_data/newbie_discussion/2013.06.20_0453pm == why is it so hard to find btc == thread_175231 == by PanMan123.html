				Im from canada i was going to use cavirtex but they no longer support cash deposits via BMO or any other bank. Only direct deposit via my own bank and im not going to do that for obvious reasons. Anyone know any sites i can buy btc in canada anonymously?<br /><br /><br />Thanks.

				This is how i get SR credits:<br /><br />dagensia.eu<br /><br />I deposit money via bank transfer or&nbsp; sofort (Germany only).<br />Then i just use my deposited money to buy Bitcoins and send them directly to the SR address.<br />After the amount is credited i just get a new address @ SR account.<br /><br />As a consumer i don&#039;t think this is risky and/or traceable.<br /><br />!!! My opinion, no need to start a discussion about my method. !!!

				didn&#039;t know it was?&nbsp; I read a post saying whats wrong with bitinstant etc I cant get on for days and I&#039;ve just got back from getting some.&nbsp; The new bitinstant site is 100% times faster than before. at least as a quest using btc-e. last one a few days ago I had everything done in under 15 min. I couldn&#039;t believe how fast it is now. I am probably screwing myself with murphy&#039;s law right now but I&#039;ve never had a single issue using the bit to email on bitinstant. never took more than an hour and always when there was a thread by someone saying it didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Am I lucky or are they doing something wrong?

				Buying Bitcoins is perfectly Legal. There are lots of legitimate uses for them now, from buying cd&#039;s to buying software.

				Something has recently changed in Canada all the people who were accepting bank deposits have stopped as of June 20th. Canadianbitcoins,virtex and others are now asking clients to register with personal information. Must be a bank thing or anti money laundering shit. Things might change who knows.

				+1 localbitcoins.com, and bitinstant has worked flawlessly for me so far as well.&nbsp; Not sure if you can use bitinstant in Canada (and my TOR is too slow for me to want to look it up right now, sorry) but if not I&#039;ll mention them anyway for any US users who come across your post.<br /><br />Another option (as I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware) is MoneyPak, and iirc I&#039;ve seen reputable looking vendors on SR exchanging BTC for MPK at ok-ish rates as well.<br />
