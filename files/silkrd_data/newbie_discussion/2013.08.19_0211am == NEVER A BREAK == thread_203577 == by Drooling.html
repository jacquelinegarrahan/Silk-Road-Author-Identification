				Up until a year ago I have never been subject to drug testing. (Been self employed.) But due to certain circumstances and market forces I have sold my business to work for a large corporation. <br /><br />When I was self employed I had the freedom to smoke when I wanted without fear.<br />But I did not always like the people I would have to deal with to get the product. Some so careless that just to be associated with them was like putting a sign on your back that says; Yes I&#039;m a druggie too!<br />Just got to where It was not worth the trouble sometimes. <br />I use to have respectable friends that I could deal with back in the day but most of them have gone the straight and narrow. Mostly due to job requirements. <br /><br />Now I stumble onto this site. (SR)<br />I feel like a kid in a candy store!<br />I almost slobbered on myself!<br /><br />But wouldn&#039;t you know it, the company I work for requires me to take drug test. <br />Of course the only thing I am interested in has THC in it.<br />I tell you I just can&#039;t get a break.<br /><br />I thought this was a free society!<br />Does not feel free. Not even cheap!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Moving is not an option. And the job is a VERY good job accept the part where you have to pee in a cup like a piece of property.<br /><br />Yes I knew some guys that were tested that brought in a clean sample from a family member and tucked in there crotch.<br />But they haD trouble with the temperature.<br /><br />Not sure about the &quot;fake pee&quot; This is a pretty big company. I&#039;m a little afraid of them detecting that it might be fake. And still it is difficult to get the temp just right. Even a heating pad can be too hot or cold.<br /><br />Ha! Perhaps I need to stick the sample up may A hole! :o)<br /><br />OK that may be a little more trouble than it&#039;s worth.<br />

				Are your tests random, or do you get a little notice? <br /><br />I interviewed with a large company once and of course I went stoned (I have good reasons for this, my job coach even recommended it) I got the job and was given a piece of paper to take to the clinic down the road and pee before 5 and it was 1. I did what that same job coach recommended. I drank so much water that I pissed water, plain and simple. It is technically pee and temperature maintained by my bladder. <br /><br />Apparently this only worked because certain companies have levels of certain drugs they will accept. So this basically made me look like a possible occasional smoker or victim of contact, rather then a lazy stoner. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if the reasoning is 100%, but I got the job and got the info from someone who&#039;s job is to get people jobs and also smoked pot.<br /><br />BTW, that was the most miserable 3 years of my life, I hate that place that I will not name. I will say if the original founder came back to life he would kicking some executive asses right out of 100th floor windows.

				SAGGY <br /><br />I get a call from the company and have to drive in to a clinic. <br /><br />I have not smoked anything for over a year. Just a day before they called me I tried some of that legal bud. Yuck!<br />I think I&#039;ll stay straight before I do that again.<br /><br />Anyway I smoked it through my old pipe that I use to use for &quot;higher&quot; purposes. I was afraid there might be enough residual in the bowl to put something in my system so I got a little paranoid and drank some of that detox.<br /><br />Needless to say I came up diluted. So they called me the next day and had me come in again. I passed but only because I had not been smoking real pot. <br /><br />I wish I was one of those guys that liked to drink. Then it would be no problem. But I don&#039;t. <br />After finding this site I was reminded of what I was missing. Kind of depressing.<br /><br />Not sure if I can bring myself to do the Wizzinator. But I am pondering it.

				From what I can tell the wizzinator is good if you are going to be observed but they use a heat pad to old temperature.<br />You might be too warm or not warm enough. I guess you would need to practice a few times to make sure your temp holds so it might be a good idea to get extra supplies.<br />I&#039;ve seen prices from $50 to $150<br /><br />The urinator is about $150. It is battery operated so the temperature will be right on.<br />However there is no prosthetic penis.<br /><br />I imagine if you purchased both you get the best of both worlds. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				If your really paranoid, only smoke in the days following the test. After that stay active, eat healthy and trim any excess fat your holding on to, then wait for the next one. I did this for a while as a teenager when I would get tested weekly after getting busted in school. My test was Wednesday afternoon, I grooved Wednesday night, and took weight training and PE at the same time. Never failed. I also drank mass amounts of water all week long.<br /><br />Lots of clinics can test for the popular detox ingredients these days, and I hear they are starting to test for the active ingredients you find in all that fake pot and spice crap as well.<br /><br />I tried that spice crap on a friend&#039;s recommendation and the only thing I ever got was explosive diarrhea.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				oh lord, a thread on passing UA tests, i saw a thread on grasscity (some of you may know what it is) its a pot enthusiast site where everyone discusses anything related to weed and this one guy messaged me asking if &quot;dog urine will fool a drug test&quot; and how he collected it ._. , DONT BE THAT GUY, if you have to resort to getting urine from your pet dog to pass a drug test, maybe its time to lay off the bud, but otherwise, im a guy with very little fat on me so pot passes through my system in 1-3 days MAX, but remember remember remember, DRINK LOTS OF WATER AND GATORADE, make sure gatorade so it colors your pee, most companies have certain allowed ng of substances, in case your friend was smoking a doob around you, but if your pee is clear they find it suspicious and lower the amount they&#039;re looking for. good luck my friend.

				If they aren&#039;t going to actually watch the piss come our of your dick (in some places, they can&#039;t by law), then substituting with QuickFix Synthetic Urine is the way to go.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done it multiple times, and it passes intense hazmat urine tests.&nbsp; It comes with two handwarmers, like you might use when camping.&nbsp; First, before you leave the house, you put the quickfix in the microwave for 10-15 seconds to get it up to 98 degrees (there&#039;s a temperature guage on the side of the bottle).&nbsp; Then you shake the handwarmers to activate them, open them, and attach them to the bottle of quickfix with the provided rubber band.&nbsp; Then stick it in your crotch.&nbsp; It will hold the temp for about 6 hours or so.&nbsp; Alternately, you can buy the urinator, and pour quickfix into it.&nbsp; It keeps the temp using batteries instead of handwarmers.&nbsp; That quickfix is the shit.&nbsp; It&#039;s perfect in every way.&nbsp; The only way they could tell it was synthetic is if they did a DNA test on it, which is expensive and against the law to do without your consent.&nbsp; When I use it, I actually take TWO bottles with me, warmed up and ready to go.&nbsp; Just in case they spill the first one...OR if anything happens and they are suspicious and tell you to pee again in 2 hours, I would have another.&nbsp; It&#039;s never happened, but it&#039;s well worth the wasted $30.&nbsp;

				To go along with what was said above. If you do get hurt it is a good idea to play it off and go to the Dr on your own insurance if you can&#039;t pass a test on the spot. I broke my toe at a furniture ware house while unloading a truck once. I just limped around the rest of the day in pain and went to the er after work. When calling in to work I did not lie, I said &quot;I dropped a dresser on my toe&quot; just left out the fact that it happened at work.<br /><br />I have a friend that basically ruined his life after breaking his neck at work and failing a test. He got no workers comp and by the time he was approved for any kind of supplemental help he was healed (as much as he could be) and picked up a desk job at 1/5 his former salary. With of course a huge stack of medical bills and court dates for them. Lost his house, cars, and most of everything he owned. Now he is raising his kids in an apartment complex where he doesn&#039;t let the associate with anyone or ride the bus to school in fear for their safety.

				No scare tactic here. With this job I actually work for more than one company. Each company makes you go through the drug test. You never know when a different company will call on you.<br /><br />It&#039;s doesn&#039;t seem right. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not constitutional, but this is the price we have to pay.<br /><br />I could see where if something happened on the job like an accident or the employee were displaying a behavior that might be detrimental to the business but just to say; If your going to work for me I have the right to test you for drugs just does not seem in keeping with a free society. <br />Especially with weed! What I do on my time should be my own business. I am a grown up.<br /><br />Same goes for LE. Unless I give probable cause, it should be my business. <br /><br />It&#039;s amazing this hypocrisy has gone on for so long. I think it is a testament to the failings of modern society.<br /><br />

				The biggest BS that I find is that they can refuse to hire you based on a drug test, but if you are &quot;addicted&quot; then it is considered a disability in a lot of states then they can not fire that person who is going to fail that same drug test.<br /><br />Any one here addicted to weed?

If they want to smoke a doob at 3am because there is nothing better to do then watch activity lights then go for it, just have it together when those lights stop blinking.
