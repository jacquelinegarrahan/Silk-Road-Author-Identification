				I&#039;ve always been interested in these stimulants that are suppose to help you study and whatnot and looked up Adderall and Ritalin. As being located in Europe, there is a significant lack of Adderall being sold and it seems it is only sold from US vendors. The only problem with this is that shipping costs from US vendors are pretty high so it puts me off buying. I bought some Ritalin pills from someone based in Slovakia from SR which were 10mg and these worked reasonably well but everyone says Adderall is a lot better.<br /><br />My question is to know whether you think it&#039;s worth it to pay the extra shipping costs to get it from the US, or to stick with Ritalin?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				i test at this time Rubifen (spanish ritalin) from slovenia (pro vendor, for sure!). I would also try this Adderal, but I will not order until the U.S., I do not trust, although there is no reason why it does not work, but because it is too expensive. I tested Concerta XL too (u can find it in UK vendor), good product to be concentrate and more sociable (true)&nbsp; but expensive too. So i think Ritalin is a good compromise for the small budget if u are in EU.

				I don&#039;t think Adderall is prescribed in Europe.

				adderall is definitely the next level mate. I would say the higher price is well worth it. the effect will be like ritalin, but considerably amplified.
