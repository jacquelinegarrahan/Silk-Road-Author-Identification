				Title: <strong>Rails Cocaine</strong><br />

				Hey, I hate being a newbie, but I&#039;m hoping to get to 50 posts as quick as possible! If someone can repost this for me in the cocaine thread, I&#039;m sure rails would appreciate it :)<br /><br />Hoping a lot of people can see this because I&#039;m super impressed with this vendor.&nbsp; I was reading the cocaine thread in the real section of the forums and saw that rails was getting a good wrap from Marlon.&nbsp; The gear was cheap so I thought I didn&#039;t have much to lose so went ahead with this new vendor.<br /><br />In short, best stealth I&#039;ve seen, clean, strong and affordable coke.<br /><br />I hate the idea of posting my location however I think in this case it&#039;s appropriate.&nbsp; Rails mentions on his profile that he will ship to Aus but at the buyers own risk with no possibility of refund and you must FE.&nbsp; Obviously I was nervous about this but thought I&#039;d give it a go anyway.&nbsp; 5 business days later I received a letter from rails with the gram I ordered.&nbsp; Stealth was amazing, the best I&#039;ve seen from all of my orders!&nbsp; The gear came as full rocks, hardly any powder, the rocks broke easily.&nbsp; The comeup is clean and not speedy at all.&nbsp; There is a solid period of euphoria for about 20 minutes before you slowly start to come down.&nbsp; With a dose of 100mg I had mild rushing and bursting clean euphoria.&nbsp; I continued to redose every 30 - 45 mins to keep riding this wave of joy.&nbsp; I felt on top of the world, and too bad I was by myself for this trial as I would have loved to share this experience with some friends or my girl, I can only imagine I would have been super chatty and confident.<br /><br />Definitely will be back and hopefully with a bit of trust Rails will relax on his shipping policy.

				I picked this guy as he had good reviews on SR but I am skeptical now as tried the product and was VERY disappointed! <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t even numb your gums and if anything you feel like you&#039;re on speed or a high dose of caffeine. Even street quality is better.<br /><br />I&#039;m no n00b to coke, and had my fair share in the last decade.. Tried MrRouid and this was the real deal... <br /><br />Only chose Rails due to locality and price.. now I regret it...I&#039;m doing a resolution on SR and hope to have my 50% back.<br /><br />
