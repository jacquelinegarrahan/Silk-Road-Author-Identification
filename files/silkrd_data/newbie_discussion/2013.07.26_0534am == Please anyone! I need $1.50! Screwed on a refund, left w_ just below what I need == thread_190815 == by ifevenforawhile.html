				Hey all,<br /><br />So I made an order which was canceled for some reason by The Scurvy Crew. I know I did everything correctly, so I have no idea why.<br /><br />Anyways, when they refunded me, I received slightly less coin than I had originally, about $1.50 short. Problem is, I bought just enough coin for this specific item, and now I can&#039;t afford it! I&#039;m merely $1.50 short.<br /><br />If anyone can help me out, it would be greatly appreciated. All I need is a $1.50, so that I may re-place the order once I&#039;ve sorted out why it was canceled. Please, help a brother out!

				Obviously you did something wrong if they cancelled it. Make sure you encrypted to their public key, and that you put your address down correctly. I literally have $.50 in BTC right now so I can&#039;t help, but I&#039;ll bump.

				Well, I&#039;m pretty certain that I encrypted properly. I triple checked my info and everything. Only thing is that I&#039;m pretty new with just 1 buy so far... but they said that&#039;s okay, so long as you finalize early.

				Gonna bump before this is buried. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll get lucky, but it&#039;s worth a try. I really don&#039;t want to buy more bitcoins just so I can pay the extra $1.50

				It&#039;s usually my policy to never do something like this, mostly because it encourages scammers, but the same annoying shit happened to me. Give me the address and ill send it to ya
