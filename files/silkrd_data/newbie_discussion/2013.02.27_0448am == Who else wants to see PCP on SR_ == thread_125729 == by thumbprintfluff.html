				&nbsp; Yeah I know it&#039;s not very popular but some people really like it.... like me! Shit I&#039;m even out of mxe now. Ketamine is just way too short lasting, ell even mxe for that matter. IDK I like gambling I guess, and that&#039;s what disso&#039;s are like for me.... never know what you&#039;re gonna get! What I mean is sometimes you will just get relaxed, same dose get a real social high, sometimes you get alot of visuals, sometime you think you died, and every now and than you just have that super phenominal trip/ just totally angelic feeling words can&#039;t describe!!!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Come on you east/west cost vendors! Quit holdin out! Atleast on me!&nbsp; Been way too long.<br /><br />

				Anyone here seen PCP on the street lately?&nbsp; Weird that standard-panel urine drug tests test for a now pretty uncommon drug considering.

				PCP is the one substance I&#039;ve always been scared to try. I still have no desire. That Steve-o movie reinforced that for me.<br /><br />I know there are probably other threads about it, but can one of you give me a brief description of what it&#039;s like and/or why you like it? Not judging, just curious.

				&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been an adrenaline junkie/thrill seeker. Guess that&#039;s why I like it. And it feels good. Did some coke yesterday, and some H today.... Would gladly trade em both for some dust!&nbsp; &nbsp; But obviously some people can&#039;t handle it! It&#039;s nothing to play around with..&nbsp; I think it&#039;s like alcohol in that aspect.&nbsp; Brings out your hidden side/dark secrets. Some people want to walk around neked in public, then cut there penis off and feed it to there dog!
