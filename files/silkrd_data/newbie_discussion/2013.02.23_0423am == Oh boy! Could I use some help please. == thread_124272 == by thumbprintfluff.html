				&nbsp; First off, let me say that this is a great thing! Like a dream come true for me! Some people&#039;s goals in life are to buy a home, have a family, travel....&nbsp; Well mine is to research exotic, well most chems. lol. But I always had limited access. <br />&nbsp; I&#039;m oldskool and suck with computers. Luckily I have friends that helped me get here. Even he had a little trouble, probably a good thing. OK so I&#039;m here and think I got the bitcoin thing somewhat figured out but have a few ?&#039;s to start with.<br />1- What does karma mean?<br />2- Won&#039;t be doing it for awhile, but can you trade on here?<br />3- How can you judge who to trust? Everyone finalizes early to avoid automatic so you rarely see less than 5/5. What does it affect if you get an automatic?<br />4- Just my luck the 2 things I really wanted are not listed (PCP and DOM (stp from the 60&#039;s). They too risky or what?<br />5- Any tips or suggestions you think would be useful to me are greatly appreciated. Remember I&#039;m somewhat computer illiterate but intelligent.<br />&nbsp; I&#039;ll hopefully be ready to purchase by Monday, and sure I will have more questions then&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

				Hey, dude. I think we&#039;re just stuck in noob prison until we reach a 50 post threshold. What&#039;s up? I just posted my first a few seconds ago, saw your post. How old are you?

				1. Karma is the +0/-0 by your name and avatar. If someone likes your posts, they give you +1. If they don&#039;t like one, they&#039;ll give you -1. It&#039;s kind of like in Reddit. It&#039;s supposed to give you some idea of people&#039;s reputations around here, but it can be easily abused and is sometimes disregarded.<br />2. SR offers great tools for keeping safe (anonymity, hedging, etc.). You can trade outside of the SR, but it&#039;s safer to pay for a vendor account if that strikes your fancy.<br />3. Read the forums. Decent vendors will usually not require you to FE (unless it&#039;s your first couple of purchases). I&#039;d suggest reading the vendor you&#039;re interested in&#039;s review thread. I&#039;d also suggest trying to find a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE from new customers. Find a well-reviewed vendor who does this and you&#039;re set.<br />4. No idea I&#039;m afraid. (Is this the PCP you were looking for: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/62 ?)<br />5. Make sure you know how to encrypt your address (with PGP). You&#039;ll need to send it encrypted when you make your purchase. Make sure to read the forums about your intended vendor to make sure you don&#039;t get scammed. Never sign for a package (or choose a postage option that requires signing). And be curteous with vendors, some users seem to think this is Walmart&#039;s drug section. Best of luck and happy tripping friend, this is a fucking amazing place we&#039;ve stumbled upon.

				Read the stickies.<br />Read the popular threads.<br />Read the Silk Road wiki.<br />Read about BitCoin.<br />Read about PGP encryption.<br />Read<br />READ!<br /><br />When you are planning to buy:<br />Read everything in the product&#039;s description.<br />Read everything in the vendor&#039;s main page.<br /><br />Then read it all again.<br /><br />I just made my first order after browsing and reading for a few days, but I had a bit of a head-start with a few topics.<br />Dealing with Bitcoins wasn&#039;t exactly painless but everything concerning Silk Road was easy enough.<br /><br />If you need some help, shoot me a PM.<br />Good luck.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; ;D

				Hey dude, the blotter scene has moved on. I am old dont know about school but i like drugs, i like the new drugs too. Cant be fucked doing acid but had a little forray into RC land last week. WOW!!!!!! <br />I like to get positive before a new thing so i had a pt of meth then cut off a 1/3 of a 25i nbome, 1200 units, so probably had about 3/400. put it in my gum and cruised watching some porn not really into it just killing time. At some point over the next 1/2ish hour i felt like i was in the movie, feeling every muscle movement sensation that the actors were. It was&#039;nt like i was rampant excited more i could feel so clearly. Pretty much stayed in that position for the next 4/5 hours. With amazing colour trails, audio hallucantion etc To me it was a cross of Ketamine tunnel, LSD and MDMA. Fuck those kids must get high who take the full blotter. So old school give that a kick and it might remind you of that STP thing.

				&nbsp;Thanks all of you for responding/help... I&#039;ll keep studying!&nbsp; &nbsp;You are right macmeth. The 25inbomes the shit! I just ran out a few weeks ago. But fuck sublingual. I had freebase. Converted some to hcl and wasn&#039;t too impressed with sub. VAPING is the way to go with that! With FB of course. I vaped about 2 mgs one night and have to say that was ranked one of my top 20 trips.<br />&nbsp; Now that I learned of this 50 post thing I&#039;ll tell the story behind my username next.<br /><br />&nbsp; I emailed 3 sellers just now of some immediate 4sure things I want. Hope I didn&#039;t scare em! lol

				&nbsp;I was thinking of giving the 25c a go. Unfortunately, the one vendor (out of 3) I contacted that has that and mxe didn&#039;t get back to me:( That&#039;s not good business to me. The other 2 did for other things I want.
