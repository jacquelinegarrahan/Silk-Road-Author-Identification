				Interested in samples of basically anything. I meet the criteria. Although, coincidentally, the three drugs I&#039;m interested in most at the moment are LSD, MDMA, and Xanax so this works very well. <br /><br />I may want to just purchase some of your goods. It&#039;s too bad SR is down because I&#039;d like to take a look at your products. <br /><br />I&#039;d only pay around $70.00-$80.00 for reasonably good coke but judging by your MDMA prices, you won&#039;t have it in that price range. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to subscribe for updates and what not. <br /><br />Edit: My OCD wanted better wording

				I&#039;m not a coke veteran so I probably wouldn&#039;t mind. I don&#039;t want to make any promises right now but I have been in the market for these things for a while. We&#039;ll see how things pan out when SR is back up. <br />+1 for your honesty about everything!

				No new vender is allowed to ask anyone for FE, and we will not ask you to we will ask you to on bigger orders only so we can still provide to every one that will be doing the majority of the ordering. we will go by our first month to decide if we will ask for FE on the big orders also.
