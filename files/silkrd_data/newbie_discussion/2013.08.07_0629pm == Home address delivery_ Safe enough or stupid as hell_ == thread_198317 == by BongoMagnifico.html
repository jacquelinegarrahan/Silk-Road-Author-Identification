				If you have a good friend you trust that does not keep stuff at their house you can use as a drop then pickup when it arrive and take to your place.<br /><br />If you are not ordering in bulk and only a few items at a time. My friend ships straight to his house. He gets anywhere from 1 to 3 orders in a week. Also helps he gets amazon, ebay, etc, So mail carrier knows he gets allot of packages.&nbsp; He has never had a problem or order lost and has done over 50 buys on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				I always order to my home address and put my own name on it. I live in the UK and only ever order from UK vendors. Royal Mail are so inept I can&#039;t see them ever scanning my gear and even if they did and found the stuff I could always deny any liability for the goods. Who&#039;s to say that somebody didn&#039;t just order this shit to my house to get me done?<br /><br />Always use my own name as well because I&#039;d imagine the postie knows who lives at the address due to him/her delivering my post every day so would look a bit weird if suddenly some guy called Armin Tamzarian or whatever started getting stuff sent to the flat.<br /><br />Up to you though really, innit.

				I ship to my address all the time with my name on the package. Best to use the name that goes with the address your shipping to or the package will get sent back.<br /><br />One thing I do if your sketched about shipping to your place is when you get your package <br />just write &quot;Return To Sender&quot; on the package and set it by your door for a day or so.<br />So if you are in fact being watched and they bust your door in or something you have your ass covered

I am scared as fuck as i got kids and a wife staying with me.&nbsp; someone please help me to stop worrying and tell me i am wrong.&nbsp; his feedback is also looking fake as fuck as i am still waiting for my btc/item but no response.<br /><br />on the seller guide on wiki it says:<br /><br />&quot;You and you alone will have your client&#039;s shipping address. This information must be destroyed as soon as it is used to label their package.

				I was thinking about this. I&#039;m completely new here. Just heard about this place from my friends. But they to paranoid to send something to there own addresses, so they using &quot;drop-by&quot; boxes.<br />I think I&#039;m to crazy enough to try it. By the way, is it be OK to seller, if i ask him to send me a test-message? I wanna try some real lsd, cuz i trying one last month. I live in Russia, so i know there is can&#039;t be a good lsd, just cheep shit. There is a lot of debate about think that I&#039;m using. It&#039;s in powder. It&#039;s white, got a little bitter taste. I&#039;m using it by sniffing. Some guys saying that this is lsd, because last time seller sell it on sugar. But other guys saying that this is some kind of nbome. I&#039;m really don&#039;t know what I&#039;m hiting, lol.<br />But i think, a little set, that I&#039;m trying lsd is helping, because there is some really crazy LSD-visuals like in movies. And it&#039;s last 4-8 hours, depends on dose.<br />So what do you think about test-message? Just buy some blotters from seller with no drug on it. And if shit hits the wan it&#039;s gonna be much safer, because there is no drug on it.

				Reading through the shipping tips and how various items may be discovered - I&#039;d say if it&#039;s something small and minor just ship to your home address looking like any other piece of mail.&nbsp; <br /><br />For something larger I&#039;d probably find some alternative - What are the alternatives?<br /><br />Abandoned house - Mail carrier probably knows it&#039;s abandoned, so risky<br /><br />Rent an Apartment - high overhead?&nbsp; 600-1000 a month, but could probably give a landlord fake info to stay anonymous, need to say you travel a lot or something so they don&#039;t wonder why you don&#039;t live there all the time.&nbsp; If your doing serious crap, the cops will probably be waiting for you to pick up.<br /><br />PO box - need id etc to setup,&nbsp; unless I had a great fake id, probably no benefit to that over home address, again if serious, they&#039;ll just wait for you to pick up.<br /><br />Any other ideas?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi.<br /><br />For starters, if you can, for personal small orders, use vendors within your own borders. If there is another name still attached to your address that regularly still has mail delivered there, use that as the name. My landlord&#039;s wife has lots of tax/mortgage letters arrive here (even though I have been here for years, naughty landlord!) and has no idea of the goodies that have been arriving in her name.<br /><br />There is no definitive answer to this question, it will be down to your judgement and local knowledge of LE in your country. You are ALWAYS taking a risk having your goods delivered, remember what this wonderful site is - an anonymous market for lots of things authorities have declared illegal. So critical to your thinking is to minimize any activity that arouses suspicion - there are billions of pieces of mail moving round the world at any one time and if the vendors do good stealth (check on this on forums and feedback before ordering) then it is suspicious deliveries and/or behaviour that will red flag a package. A little package arriving in your mail with a previous tenant&#039;s name on it, or a concerned citizen calling LE because they saw someone regularly checking the mail box of an empty house they had no right to be at? What do you think will raise attention?<br /><br />I get mine to the door. Over 20 transactions and no issues. But you never know, the next one could fuck me. It is ALWAYS a risk.<br /><br />Take care.

				Using empty mailboxes in a multiunit is&nbsp; probably pretty good since you know the area well.&nbsp; May be able to rinse &amp; repeat as tenants move in and move out.<br /><br />I agree on keeping things in borders based on your countries proficiency.

				I&#039;d say home address is fine for personal use.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read that very little domestic mail is checked (in the UK anyway) and if it is seized most of the time they won&#039;t go after you, you&#039;re small fry, they want to catch the dealers and distributors.&nbsp; Mail handlers, even if they know the postage does contain something illicit, probably won&#039;t care. <br /><br />Vendors on the other hand...

				Home address seems to be OK domestically.<br /><br />Higher risk obviously comes with overseas orders. If you think your address has been flagged then I&#039;d suggest using a friends address, with their permission of course.

				pick a reliable vendor, encrypt your address then home delivery should be ok.<br /><br />of course if you are running some criminal stuff out of your home then home delivery would be dumb.<br /><br />and if you live with someone else that might get busted because of you, then home delivery would make you a dick.<br /><br />so as long as you&#039;re not a dumb dick, or dumb or a dick, home delivery should be fine.

				Rethinking the apartment mailbox idea - you could probably do it a couple of times, but generally first thing that comes to your new address is a utility bill or forwarded mail bundle if you&#039;re lucky, postal carriers probably know that kind of stuff.<br /><br />Providing your postal carrier generous holiday gifts and befriending may help.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				If it is small amounts of substances for personal use than I would recommend using your real name and home address. Most packages are pretty inconspicuous and would not have any obvious reason to be intercepted, it just looks like something bought from ebay etc. If you;re using fake names and weird drop boxes then you&#039;re just adding more factors that could backfire. Besides as has been mentioned, it is highly unlikely anyone cares about smalltime users.<br /><br />If you&#039;re running a commercial system (dealing etc) then you should likely invest in some alternate delivery addresses via associates etc. Although again this adds more factors (and people, the most unreliable factors of all) which could backfire.<br /><br />Obviously it&#039;s lower risk keeping things domestic and small weight.

				I think shipping it to your actual address using your actual name is by far the least suspicious way to go.

				I use real name and address. I then rely on the seller&#039;s stealth to make sure it&#039;s not a box saying &quot;THERE ARE ILLEGAL ITEMS IN THIS PACKAGE AND IT&#039;S GOING TO THIS PERSON&#039;S REAL ADDRESS&quot; in huge letters.&nbsp; I tend to get a few packages a month so it doesn&#039;t look odd at all.

				I have never had a problem with deliveries in my own name to my own address. And I&#039;ve had plenty, from all over the world. So not to worry, place your orders and enjoy.<br /><br />You should worry more about the stealth of the vendor. Does the pkg look professional? Does it attract unusual attention for any reason, using sight, smell, feel? Can you trust them? Will they save your address and blackmail you?&nbsp; Do you control your mail, or do you have a wife, landlord who may handle it first? Compared to these things, using your own name and address for a small amount is not a problem.<br /><br />Even a sloppy vendor gets through, but they don&#039;t stay in business very long. Its called Darwinism.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				yes as stated over and over again...unless you buying in bulk you&#039;re going to be O.K. Especially if you order a lot of shit of the internet...you&#039;re going to be just fine!<br /><br /><br />Mr.Black
