				Hello everyone! April this year I&#039;ve been introduced to techno parties and MDMA at the same time. I loved it so much that it was difficult to go clubbing without taking MDMA, and now I&#039;m not so motivated to go to techno parties if I know that probably I will be too tired early (early for what techno parties last), and my legs will hurt (no, I&#039;ve not been doing a lot of sports early).<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever realized what caffeine&#039;s effects feel like, so energy drinks won&#039;t do anything.<br /><br />So basically I&#039;m looking for maybe a &quot;soft&quot; stimulant, legal or not, that is the less harmful possible, and at least just take my sleepiness off. Does that exist?

				What&#039;s about using amphetamine? You just have to insufflate a very small bump for a clear and long-lasting powerful high! If you don&#039;t take too much it&#039;s just pure power without any problematic side-effects.<br /><br />You also will be more talkactive and for me it&#039;s also easier to listen to other people. <br /><br />I can recommend the Amphetamine Phosphat from iisthisisi

				Be easy... These are hard things that take a roll on your brain and body...You are effectively removing the chemicals your brain naturally produces, meaning you may never feel the normal happiness at the level you should. Mdma is a very strong substance, make sure to wait as long as you can before doses this is important.

				@peacefullsoul: Yeah, that&#039;s important. Don&#039;t use it daily and plan the endings of your weekends well (especially if you skip sleep of one night) so that you are 100% fit on Monday!<br /><br />As a natural supplement I can also recommend some teaspoons of Coca Leaves (Powder) from &quot;green river&quot;. It&#039;s very healthy and gives you power with a much more natural feeling than from amphetamines. You can drink a great amount of it or - if you wanna do - you can chew the leaves out while partying!<br /><br />This will give you energy, euphoria and definitly no comingdown - quite the contrary: I always felt much better the next day and had absolutely NO problems falling asleep after partying with Mama Coca.<br /><br />You ever tried really potent Hash/Piece? Everytime I smoke high-quality hash (get it local, so I can&#039;t recommend any vendor - sorry) I really get strongly awake, full of power and have to smile sooo much. The last time when I smoked that stuff I always felt like on MDMA with the ability to eat, too!<br />Maybe you can combine Coca and Premium Hash? Never tried it but as soon as I get my actual order of Coca Leaves, I will try! :)<br /><br />SmoothUp

				I recently have been trying 2c-b and methylone as an alternative to MDMA to go clubbing, basically to restrict serotonine depletion.<br /><br />2c-b: this is a bit tricky as it is very dose dependent and taking to little will be unsatisfying and taking to much will be overwhelming. I have established my comfortable, clubbing-compatible dose by now, but at some point I always end up standing still in the middle of the dancefloor with my eyes closed, completely absorbed by the music and the closed-eye-visuals. I enjoy that but it may not always be convenient...<br /><br />Methylone: For me this worked out extremely well, but opinions vary (more so than with MDMA I would say, which works out well for the big majority of people) and of course methylone has much less history and study than MDMA. But take similar precautions as with MDMA, dose and redose wisely, and you will be up all night for sure. <br />My most recent experience was combining methylone + 2cb (150 mg methylone + 25 mg 2cb + 100 mg methylone, with 45-60 mins intervals) with a very good dj and a very nice crowd. Most euphoric moment ever :-)<br />Definitely a different kind of euphoria than MDMA (without the love) but very on top of the worldish.<br /><br />Anyway, read erowid for more information and other experiences and be safe!

Taking &#039;too much&#039; will make you want sit somewhere with your eyes closed for the nice CEV&#039;s. <br /><br />I prefer around 20-24 mg of 2c-b H.Cl (a little more if it&#039;s Br), but the dosage needed greatly varies between persons.<br />Alcohol also gives it an extra boost, so if you&#039;re drinking you might want to drop it to 17-20 mg.<br />The big plus is that if you open your eyes you will be more or less sober, and able to focus on any task.<br /><br />Taking a small dose of LSD can also be nice, for example a third of a tab, but the setting has to be right.

				MDMA is not a &quot;soft&quot; stimulant in any sense of the word; it isn&#039;t addictive like some drugs but it is as powerful as other stimulants by weight certainly. The only soft stimulants i know of are caffeine and stuff like coca leaves. What you are looking for are hard stimulants that can be taken in small doses to enhance your clubbing experience and keep you awake. <br /><br />I agree with the recommendation for amphetamine, clean speed is quite safe, long lasting and has few side effects except for loss of sleep (which is what you are looking for anyway). Speed&#039;s pretty cheap as well. For an inexperienced user, I can recommend mrouid&#039;s speed pills, guaranteed easy purchase and consistent quality and dose. Speed doesn&#039;t at all replicate the same magic of E, mostly just an energy rush. Methylone is a decent choice, however I have found it to be very mellow and introspective compared to MDMA and not something I&#039;d want to take to party all night on.<br /><br />I&#039;m probably gonna get downvoted for this but you might look into MDPV. Some call it 21st century coke or whatever, in addition to being as stimulating as speed, it has some of the empathetic and euphoric qualities as MDMA. As far as I have heard safe in low doses, and you need VERY little to be high off your ass for 12 hrs. I have found it doesn&#039;t build much tolerance and the quality stuff has not too bad a comedown and little of the long-lasting after affects of molly. Like any good stimulant, has addictive properties and causes the desire for re-dosing, so be careful if you&#039;re worried. Also, extraordinarily cheap; 1g will get you boosted many dozens of times, for around $30. Best I&#039;ve done so far was from nawlins on SR.

				Doing MDMA two nights in a row will really deplete your serotonin... That&#039;s why on such occasions I prefer one night of 2cb, one night of MDMA, not necessarily in that order.<br />

I don&#039;t want to do MDMA at every party I go as well. Not only because of the neurotoxicity, but also because of the loss of magic.<br /><br />The less frequently you do MDMA, the better it gets every time you do it :)<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll stay with low-dose LSD and maybe try mixing it with coca leaves!

				I dont want to blow all of your minds to hard now, but a pretty good alternative to MDMA is: somewhat less MDMA.<br />Just lower that dose, it scales. Just break that pill in half, then break the pieces in half again. There you go, 4 low doses of MDMA, enjoy.
