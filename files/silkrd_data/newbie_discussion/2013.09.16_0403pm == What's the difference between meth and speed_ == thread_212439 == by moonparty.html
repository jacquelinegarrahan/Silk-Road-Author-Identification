				Or even crystal and ice for that matter?<br /><br />I used to think meth = crystal = exploding garage lab drug. <br /><br />Speed I thought was either another word for meth, or a generic term for prescription strength &quot;uppers,&quot; the &quot;momma&#039;s little helpers&quot; variety.<br /><br />But over the years I&#039;ve heard all the terms used interchangeably, probably just guesses by people as naive as me. Like I&#039;ve heard people say &quot;I only do ice, because that&#039;s pure crystal, not meth.&quot;

				Speed is Amphetamine, while meth is short for Methamphetamine, they are different chemicals but both intense stimulants. Crystal Meth is Methamphetamine, which is what is usually being made in exploding garage labs, a lot of the chemicals used in the synthesis are volatile and if mishandled can cause explosions. Ice is a term that I don&#039;t really think means anything specific, you can describe both meth or amphetamine as ice. <br /><br />If someone says they don&#039;t do meth but they do crystal, they&#039;re retarded, unless by crystal they mean something other than crystal methamphetamine.

				Fun fact: &quot;Although rarely prescribed, methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity under the trade name Desoxyn.&quot;<br />-Wikipedia
