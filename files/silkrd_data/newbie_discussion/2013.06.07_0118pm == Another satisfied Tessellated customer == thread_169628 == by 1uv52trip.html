				I got my first order from Tess yesterday, it came in the mail as stealthy as can be! I know now, that there will be many more orders from Tess in the future because of this trip. I&#039;m going to sum up my trip and experience here, if I can. I took 2 hits of the white blotter with no picture on it. I can give you a thousand reasons I took 2 hits. I&#039;ve done this so many times and it&#039;s been YEARS since I have experienced true LSD. But 2 hits was what I took. I have taken 2 so many times, why would this time be any different. But this LSD I got from Tess is NOT anything I have had in over 14 years. I spent the whole night debating if I needed 2 hits or just one. I tripped balls and I cant say I have used that expression in some time but I was fucking gone..and I loved it. After 40 minutes I was tripping balls, did I say that already? Insane visuals and mind was gone. I started to watch the movie &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;. I had never seen this movie straight and I can&#039;t tell you anything about what I saw or experienced in that movie. I don&#039;t know what was movie and what was in my mind anymore. Somehow about 3/4 of the way through the movie I hit a button on the remote and stopped the movie. Not sure how the movie ends, but it was great what I saw. I ended up watching 4 hours of the Universe on the Science channel. There was no way the people that made these shows knew what LSD would make them look like, but it was also insane to watch. I experienced universal enlightenment that I wish everyone the opportunity to feel. I couldn&#039;t have asked for anything better. To say Tess&#039;s stuff deserves a 5 is nothing...it is A+. If you want to trip, if you know what you want from LSD I can confirm this stuff will take you there and you wont need 4 hits to have a good trip. If you do order from Tess, start off with 1 hit and go from there.

				Sounds like an interesting experience :).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been meaning to get my hands on that film to add to my collection, it looks interesting on it&#039;s own, nevermind while having a mind bending experience.

				Me and three friends are taking two of tessellated&#039;s tabs tomorrow night on the beach. I am very excited and think this will be one of my best LSD experiences to date!<br /><br />I just hope my friends can handle this shit. The three of them have only tripped on L once, but they are pretty experienced with shrooms. <br /><br />Glad you had an awesome trip, I hope tomorrow night comes quick!<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Everyone can handle it, get in the right mindset before you drop and you will be fine. Have them take 1 at first. I was feeling the effects within 30 minutes. Peaking after an hour... and the the stars in the night sky were amazing last night as well.
