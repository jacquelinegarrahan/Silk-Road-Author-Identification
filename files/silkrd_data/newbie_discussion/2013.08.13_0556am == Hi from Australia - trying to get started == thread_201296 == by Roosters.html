				Hi to all, was hoping for some info on the best/fastest way to purchase some bitcoins so that I can get started.&nbsp; I&#039;m in Australia, and whilst I did register with Mt Gox, I&#039;ve read some stuff onlione that suggests their deposit times can be quite long before you actually have the bitcoins in your wallet to spend<br /><br />any info very much appreciated<br />Roosters

				Hi :) hope you have an awesome experience here on the Road. As to your question, I would avoid Mt Gox like a used syringe on the bus, if for no other reason than that you have to identify yourself in order to get your coin. There are more reasons, but that one&#039;s enough! If you&#039;re in Australia you have good options for buying btc and remaining anon. You can visit <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;***Warning Clearnet link***<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.btradeaustralia.com<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;They are an established trading business, so quite reliable. You can deposit cash anon over the counter at a number of banks, and they will transfer you your coins in a few hours. These businesses, though, generally don&#039;t allow you to order from them when using tor, so you might want to go to an icafe or a library and place your order and create a blockchain wallet on the pc&#039;s there to protect your identity.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I recommend, however, the following<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ***Warning Clearnet link***<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;https://localbitcoins.com<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can order from this site while connected to tor so can use from home pretty safely. It&#039;s basically a market site where vendors buying and selling bitcoins list their prices and methods of payment. You&#039;ll be able to find many who accept anon deposit at the bank. The site holds the amount of coin you order in escrow, like SR, and once you&#039;ve deposited your money into the vendors account they release it to you for you to do as you please :)&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s usually a little more expensive (like a $1-$2 a bitcoin more than btradeaustralia, who themselves are generally $1-$3 a bitcoin more than Mt Gox) but the speed and anonymity and control you have more than make up for it. Check it out, you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck, Hitch.

				Brilliant info, many thanks Hitch, I&#039;ll be checking out localbitcoins<br /><br />Just one other thing, when I registered with Mt Gox they set up a wallet for me (I think), so if I&#039;m not going to use them do I just go and set up my own wallet and just save that on my desktop?<br /><br />

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Unless you&#039;re planning on buying and saving btc for long-term investment I wouldn&#039;t bother with an offline wallet. If you&#039;re just planning on buying some btc to get some stuff off the Road, and you&#039;re more interested in security and anonymity then every time you&#039;re going to buy some coin create a couple of new online btc wallets like the one below<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;***Warning Clearnet link***<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;https://blockchain.info/wallet/<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To be extra safe, create at least two wallets, each one from a different online provider, google for others. When you get your btc from localbitcoin it goes into a wallet you have on that site. From there, using tor, transfer it through your other two wallets before sending it on to your SR wallet. To be really safe, every time you transfer the coin click use a new identity on the tor control panel. This is just to disguise the trail a bit more.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Be mindful, the wallet providers are free, but by default they charge a tiny fee to compensate the individuals who run the network nodes that allow you to transfer the coin, generally it&#039;s 0.005 btc, but if you only buy the exact amount of coin you think you need to make the SR purchase you want, you may find yourself short :( Also btc fluctuates a bit, so you might be up a bit after a few hours, but you might be down a bit also. Best to buy a little extra to give yourself some leeway.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can turn the miners fee off, but it&#039;ll be a really slow transaction, and they do deserve a bit of compensation for operating the superstructure of the bitcoin phenomenon. Have fun, Hitch.

				I get my bit coins from (clearnet) spendbitcoins.com - they are pretty pricey - I think they charge about 10% but I think its worth it for the high level of anonymity and how easy it is. <br /><br />Basically you go to spendbitcoins, enter in your wallet number, and how many bit coins you want or how much $$ you want to spend. It then places an order for you, and provides you with an account number, bsb and reference number for an account with one of 4 big banks. You then have 4 hours to make your deposit. <br /><br />I use bendigo bank as I have never had to show ID or give them my name or anything like that. <br /><br />The bit coins are usually available in your wallet within an hour, and from there you just transfer them over to SR.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />My first post here and I&#039;d also like to get started. I hope the OP doesn&#039;t mind me getting in on their thread and asking a few questions, I&#039;m also from Australia and know next to nothing about the whole process, but I would very much like to utilize the Road as it seems like the best, and cheapest option. So much information to take in at once. <br /><br />I&#039;m trying to remain as anonymous as possible but I fear I may have compromised that already by using my own Wi-Fi and Mac to create Blockchain AND LocalBitcoins.com accounts with Tor. Is that the case or has my paranoia gotten the best of me?<br /><br />Also, I haven&#039;t even set foot in the PGP threads as of yet, I was hoping to take it one step at a time and get my Bitcoins together first before learning encryption. <br /><br />Thirdly, do you think using a pre-paid CC would be the best option for buying Bitcoins? Or is cash deposit through a bank the best way to go?<br /><br />Any wisdom that can be shared would be immensely appreciated. Thanks in advance!&nbsp; :)

				You&#039;re welcome!! I am happy to share what little knowledge I have to other new users - I think SR is just amazing.... I am however a natural blonde, and without the patience and assistance of some very good friends, I would have never found my way there. Am more than happy to pay it forward so others can enjoy the experience as well.

				welcome and lots of success here!<br /><br />I recommend localbitcoins.com<br /><br />Got me bitcoins in just a couple of hours there, and you make contact to good people, who you probably can trade with more often, with the confidence of nobody else knowing about your dealings... Just find a trusted person. Good luck!
