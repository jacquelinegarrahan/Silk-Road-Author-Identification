				I don&#039;t know what country you live in. If you live in America, and you&#039;re in a public place, he can do whatever he pleases with a camera. The same goes for you, however. You&#039;re allowed to film cops.<br /><br />What happened, if you don&#039;t mind my asking? You can be discrete if it&#039;s sensitive information.

You NEVER should have concented to a search of your car. NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER concent to a search of your personal belongings without a warrant!!!!<br /><br />The first time was entirely your fault. Smoke inside. At least it was finished.<br /><br />Now, during the strip search, did they take pictures of your car? Also, did you ACTUALLY SAY, &quot;Yes, I am concenting to a search of my car without a warrant&quot;?

There is nothing stopping him. However, next time, I don&#039;t care how long you have to wait, DO NOT CONCENT TO A SEARCH.<br /><br />Is there drug residue anywhere? I don&#039;t know what you use. What if you spilt cocaine sometime? If you refuse, you ask if you are being arrested. If they say no, you say politely, &quot;Then may I leave? I am in a hurry and I do not concent to a search without a warrant.&quot;<br /><br />Without probable cause, they can&#039;t do shit.

Now, you may not like hearing this but you need to. Obviously there is far more going on then you standing in front of your house smoking a blunt. I am not saying your some kingpin drug dealer or that your a gang banger hanging in the hood, though what you said kinda makes me thinks so. Perhaps it is someone you know or hang around or are affiliated with.&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />Yes they can search with out a warrant, PROBABLE CAUSE, they make up some BS and it flies... :)

				wow you live in America, and you let a cop search your car... no wonder so many countries around the world say &quot;STUPID AMERICANS!&quot; Like everyone else is saying, even if you dont have shit hiding you never fucking let them search anything, have some dignity man! Unless a warrant is at hand, they have no right.<br /><br />From now on dude, pull your cell phone out and start video taping asap. Cops are assholes, we all know this, and they abuse their power, again we all know this.&nbsp; Use your knowledge as a citizen to protect your rights!

Weed smells far too strong. But as you said, you didn&#039;t feel as if you had anything to hide, so I&#039;m sure there&#039;s nothing.<br /><br />Why did he ask to search the car? And why did he STRIP search it? Shit, that&#039;s insane.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />And yes, RECORD RECORD RECORD. Post that shit on youtube.

If you said no, he would&#039;ve left, and nothing would&#039;ve happened. I&#039;m sorry about this, man. But you&#039;re safe. Don&#039;t worry about it. Just remain to NEVER allow a cop to search your person or car without a warrant. <br /><br />Probable cause is marijuana smell, paraphernaila, and a few other things. Visible drugs and whatnot. I&#039;m obviously not getting into the violence sector, since that&#039;s not what we&#039;re about.<br /><br />Either way, always NONONONONONO! Good luck next time, friend.
