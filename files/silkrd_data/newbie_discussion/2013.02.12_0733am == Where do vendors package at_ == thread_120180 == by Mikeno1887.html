				I had intended to post this in the shipping thread but apparently my hours spent reading make me a newbie.... Ah well I&#039;ll just leave this here as I&#039;m looking for more input.<br /><br />So my question is simple most people who vend likely have a separate laptop (oh god I&#039;d hope) and a place to package items for distribution. This got me thinking now where do you do this from? I sure as hell hope you aren&#039;t doing this from your own home. I&#039;d like vendors input on this if at all possible in the newbie thread. I then started thinking of other locations such as rented offices, storage units, trailers, locations purchased with company names to block sources of money and keep your name off public record. Or do people really just do this from your home? There are also the various problems of a storage unit like electricity (which you can workaround) or just knowing your items are safe at said location. I suppose there are warehouse locations or other things of that nature but I&#039;m thinking things that are ultimately not tied to you on paper. <br /><br />Thoughts and possible locations would be interesting to hear. <br /><br />This may be considered one of those taboo topics like money laundering so if it is let me know and I can pursue my own research. <br />

				Mmm it&#039;s not quite a topic like money laundering though. As with that the second a method gets out it will ultimately get closed. As far as general locations I&#039;m just curios as to what I&#039;ve missed location wise. <br />I would never sell from my home that&#039;s the worst idea ever. Ideally you&#039;d want to have that neatly compartmentalized and dissociated from your true identity just how receiving should be through private mailboxes and virtual offices. I should just message pine.
