				I just received some MDMA from a vendor. What should I do to enhance my trip or to prepare for it. I have x10 100MG&#039;s , looking to take 1 100MG to test the waters then take another one if I&#039;m not feeling much.<br /><br />Any preparations or tips like something to eat or drink, what to do while tripping. Anything would be helpful.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be by myself so I just have a computer and can&#039;t really go outside because it&#039;s freezing.

				Take some tums it&#039;ll make them break down slower in your stomach and last longer.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t believe vitamin C making you roll harder but if you do take then take vitamin C pills. Don&#039;t drink anything acidic because it&#039;ll break down faster

				Save it&nbsp; for a concert or something. You&#039;re going to want to be around people and I think rolling by yourself confined to a computer sounds awful. I personally like to dance and talk to people when I&#039;m not dancing. I tested out a low dose hanging around a campfire with 2 other people and it was kind of a bummer. Lights. Music. Action.<br />Also optimum first time dose is 1-1.5mg\kg so start out with .1 and if you&#039;re liking it take a little more. I weigh 200+lbs and .2 rocks my socks.

				First off, do you weigh 110 lbs? Because 100mg is the going dose for a 110 lb woman. <br /><br />Take it on an empty stomach. Tums is great about an hour beforehand. It also helps to preload with magnesium (chelated) as it will reduce jaw and other muscle tension. If you&#039;re planning on going dancing, also take some tylenol beforehand (helps control your body temperature). <br /><br />I like to sip coconut water during my roll and I&#039;ll wait until I&#039;m coming down to have some juice and/or a small meal. I&#039;ll also have a multivitamin and a b-complex afterward. <br />

Then add it the 100mg pill. <br /><br />Unless this is that dank canadian sand stuff, you&#039;ll need 140mg to get a good roll going. You&#039;ll feel pretty good on 100mg but you&#039;re not going to get any of that magic. And 200mg will be overshooting. You don&#039;t want to go over for your first roll any more than you want to go under.

				Woooo-hooo! Just took a Green Bull about 30 minutes ago and went outside and ended up running back to my house for like half a mile!<br /><br />Somehow I ended up doing two of the things you said not to do. Drinking a bunch of H20 atm.<br /><br />Took 100MG Green Bull. Feels great to be worry free. Might take another 100MG if I don&#039;t feel anything else soonish.

				100mg is fine for a first dose. My first dose was 100mg and it was the best experience ever, much better then any other time. I&#039;m currently abstaining for a few months.<br /><br />I&#039;d say have a light meal about an hour/2 hours before you take it. This will make the come up more gradual. You&#039;ll also be unable to eat for a few hours so it&#039;s a good idea to have had some food. <br /><br />Drink plenty of water and don&#039;t do too much exercise (dancing for hours etc). Also make sure to have some 5-htp for the next day. I didn&#039;t have any depression the first time I did it, was just tired the day after so make sure you don&#039;t have anything important to do. <br /><br />Now for the fun stuff, music, glowsticks etc. <br /><br />Also, stay the fuck away from your phone, Facebook, email etc. You&#039;ll end up telling people you love them etc it can get weird. <br /><br />Have fun rollin!

				Haha I can only imagine it&#039;s going to be like Get Him To The Greek.<br /><br />Stroke the furry wall! Stroke the furry wall!<br /><br />Been drinking some ater pretty frequently I can tell it&#039;s helping the whole trip. I also ate a huge tuna fish sandwhich before taking it which probably wasn&#039;t the best but it&#039;s helping with the come up and it isn&#039;t just hitting me.

				MDMA is one the greatest gifts to this world.&nbsp; Its so fun, but respect its power.&nbsp; It can turn you into a zombie with a goldfish memory pretty quickly if you abuse it.&nbsp; You can doing anything on mdma and have a great time.&nbsp; I always like to pre/post load to decrease the neurotoxicity aspect, it usually helps out a lot.&nbsp; Many threads here on vitamin/supplementation on this.&nbsp; i have found the 1.5 mg/kg is the best ratio, and then use a 50% booster if neccesary.&nbsp; I try to aim for one and done tho.

				I&#039;ve taken 2 re-doses. The second one I barely felt any different probably because I&#039;ve been rolling for so long. Took my chances and snort 1/2 a pill out of three, didn&#039;t hurt or anything. Got pretty high. There&#039;s MDMA all over my keyboard and on my fingers and it&#039;s sticky as hell. I guess I also walked into the store to pick up a Western Union package and there was a green on the tip of my nose.<br /><br />Also, teeth hurt from clenching my jaw so much. Ouch.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to taking another couple either on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.<br /><br /><br />Does anyone recommend I take some of these Vicodin to cut the come down off.

The reason is you want to replenish the serotonin and other nuerotransmitter levels in your brain.&nbsp; The magic aspect is when the release of serotonin also triggers the other neurotransmitters to all work in unison.&nbsp; when redosing, you must redose at you peak, that way when it hits you it will compliment your peak, and keep you going, otherwise you wont be able to restart the receptors.&nbsp; This is my experience with the drug.&nbsp; In regards to vicodin, do not take vicodin to come down.&nbsp; Hydrocodone is a serotegenic drug, since opiates are in such similar form to endorphins, opiates can serotonin syndrome to occur if taken in close proximity to MDMA i believe.&nbsp; This will make your hangover feel much worse from MDMA than it would have.&nbsp; Cannabis is great for coming down from MDMA, and decreases the neurotoxic effect of the drug.&nbsp; Benzo&#039;s are appropriate as well but &quot;you can always take more, you can never take less&quot; applies here.&nbsp; Ive heard GHB is the best come down from MDMA, but i have only used it once in combination.&nbsp; Make MDMA a special occasion drug, not an every weekend thing.&nbsp; You may have to find out for yourself, i had to. Once my buble burst tho i&#039;ve had more fun than i had using MDMA in a close proximity of time.&nbsp; It more magical and mind blowing when you let the magic come back.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I always eat a couple hours prior to rolling otherwise I find it takes forever to get going.&nbsp; During the roll I drink a lot of water, but also it&#039;s important to get some electrolytes in you especially if you are sweating.&nbsp; I also take tums not long after I ingest the molly so it offsets the acidity.&nbsp; I find that gum or hard candy (lollipops, jolly ranchers, etc) help the jaw clenching.

				A few grams of piracetam prior to rolling does help avoid the burn-out feeling the next day. For the come-down, I enjoy ghb which smooths out the come-down and also promotes a restful sleep. I always feel refreshed the day after a dose of ghb. It&#039;s also great for coming down most psychedelics and alleviating that nervous energy one gets when the consciousness starts to retreat back to reality.

				Remember, OP, referring to taking MDMA as &quot;tripping&quot; is racist. (The term is technically &quot;rolling,&quot; but we know what you mean.)<br /><br />PS: The ascorbic acid / vitamin C mantra is silly. It has no effect on drug potency.

				1. Empty stomach<br />2. Parachute the pill (crush into powder and put into a tiny piece of tissue, twist it up and swallow)<br />2. Orange juice<br />3. Vicks inhalers<br />4. Baby pacifiers<br />5. Black lights<br />6. Good music<br />7. Stay hydrated, but don&#039;t OVER hydrate!<br />8. Xanax for the comedown<br /><br />It&#039;s been at least 10 years since I&#039;ve done MDMA, but it was the most amazing feeling ever. However, the better the roll, the worse the comedown. I don&#039;t think I could handle that now. <br /><br />Please be safe and don&#039;t overdo it! Trust me, it could fuck your brain up. I wouldn&#039;t do it more than 6 times a year.
