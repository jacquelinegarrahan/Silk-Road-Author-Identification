				Hi All,<br />Hey just wondering if there is a way to make gift codes that have an expiration date? I would love to give out gift codes to the first 100 customers that I have had the pleasure of serving but would be nice to make it somewhat more controlled than just sending out 100 gift codes period. After all, from what I can tell, you can only issue a gift code for a BTC amount and not a set dollar amount. I don&#039;t want to issue 100 gift codes, have prices of BTC skyrocket over the next year (hypothetically) and get annihilated by 100 very valuable gift codes. If there isn&#039;t a way to do this I think it would be a really easy thing to do that could improve the site. Opinions? Ideas? Beliefs? Etc? ;)

				Yeah.... I&#039;m not a vendor that is just gonna send out my BTC. Gift Codes are designed so that you can at least set it so that it is only redeemable with you as a vendor. I want to give back a little to my customers but also encourage some business in doing so.&nbsp; Thanks for the advice though I appreciate your insight :)

				Currently the only way is to have them add it to their next order which I would imagine would not take very long...what member isnt gonna apply the gift card to their next order...but seriously if you can get DPR in here to give you a better answer i&#039;ll give out gift cards.

				Just got a PM from vendor support that just explained that the Gift code feature is disabled and they are not sure if/when it will be available again. Bummer. It seems like a feature that would greatly enhance the community. As for DPR commenting on my post... that would make my month... but i would imagine probably highly unlikely as I&#039;m sure he is fairly busy to be dealing with newb questions ;)
