				Well, I&#039;ve made six successful transactions on SR since joining a couple of months ago so I thought I&#039;d post some reviews.<br /><br />k1llin - 1 tab of WOW LSD<br />This was my first purchase and it went really well. It took a little while to process, but this is understandable considering the small amount and my initial trouble figuring out PGP. The acid was decent and worked as expected.&nbsp; <br /><br />MarthaStewart - 10 Strip LSD<br />Again, some nice acid. Martha shipped quickly, stealth could have been better but not a big deal considering the contents. <br /><br />grnjeans - 7 gram Kief <br />grnjeans sells a quality product. Shipping/stealth was decent. The keif presses into hash very easily and is worth doing imo (brings out the flavor).<br /><br />DieselTherapy - 1g brown sand MDMA<br />Took about 7 days to arrive, but the product is decent. I was a little concerned after I placed my order, DieselTherapy started getting some bad reviews round that time, with people complaining about not receiving and bunk product, but in my case it all worked out and the MDMA is certainly active.<br />&nbsp;<br />Clearance - 20 hits LSD<br />Got clearance, Clarence. Arrived promptly and with decent stealth. I&#039;ve not tasted yet but I&#039;m sure it will be decent considering Clearance&#039;s good reviews. Oh, and there was an extra tab in there, which is very nice.<br /><br />TheGrandWizardsLair - 4 hits DOM<br />Wow, DOM. I never thought I&#039;d get to try this, really looking forward to it. It arrived super quick and with good stealth. (Anyone tried this? I&#039;m thinking of starting out with 10mg but maybe that&#039;s a bad idea.)<br /><br />Thanks for reading, hope some finds this helpful!<br />
