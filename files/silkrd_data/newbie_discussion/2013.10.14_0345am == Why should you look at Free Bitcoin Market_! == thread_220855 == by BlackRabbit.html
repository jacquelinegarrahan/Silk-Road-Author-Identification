				Had some problem with server&#039;s hardware. But now we&#039;re back with new improvements.<br /><br />Added messaging system. Right now without encryption. So it&#039;s better to delete messages, after read them.<br /><br />Why should you look at Free Bitcoin Market?<br /><br />It&#039;s free! Really, absolutely free, no commissions at all! Free for both sellers and buyers!<br /><br />We just a place where anyone can put information about selling something.<br /><br />We strive to make our site really easy and anonymous as much as possible.<br /><br />The internal mail system (in the future with support for PGP encryption). Deleted messages are not stored in DB! So read message and delete it!<br /><br />We do not have a catalog. To be more precise we do not have a catalog like on other websites (for example Ebay), all items put together and in order to find them, sellers must correctly and fully describe tags of their items. So buyer using tag system could find what they&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />Simplest as much as it possible adding system. Simple fill the title, description, delivery methods, amount, tags and price. No restrictions to what you&#039;re decided to sell.<br /><br />We&#039;re trying to protect interests of sellers and buyers! To prevent scums, we developed rating system &quot;Weapon and Armor&quot;. More rating you have as a seller, less damage you get from negative reviews.<br />Actually, it&#039;s not something new. If you good, verified and succesfull seller, why buyers with low than yours rating should have a greater impact on you than buyers with a higher rating.<br /><br />Now you can verified your items. Just send mail to blackrabbit from your home page. Verified items displays on main page and marked by special sign. Verification cost is 0.25 BTC. Verified items got protection against negative feedback (-50% losing rating).<br /><br />Sellers do not miss the chance to be successful with our project! Buyers are waiting for you!<br /><br />Url in profile
