Mid-Range people, a certain one comes to mind, who like me speaks his mind, you have to gage trust in them which I did and do trust, not so easy of a call w/o dialogue first.&nbsp; Think about the &quot;what-ifs&quot;.&nbsp; If nothing can be done, nothing can be! no reflection on you!... Saw this as a security problem, because if I was one of malevolence, I could be nearing 200 posts and also a&nbsp; *vendor.....&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\&nbsp; &nbsp;All else is well , im going to put my sunshades on to not be blinded by the +1 donated lol...&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; ... I dont care ab karma right now.&nbsp; Sure, later,&quot; Hey, your an asshole, -1&quot;; or &quot;hey, you are a moron, let me point your head out of your ass *constructively&quot;, or &quot;Hey, your an asshole arrogant moron, yet logical, *but speak your mind&quot;... idk.&nbsp; Are there options to this?&nbsp; Or can all of these get to 100s, get there, become psudeovenders... use your imagination, I know not the inner-workings or if it is possible.<br /><br />Thanks for you reply, it is appreciated :)
