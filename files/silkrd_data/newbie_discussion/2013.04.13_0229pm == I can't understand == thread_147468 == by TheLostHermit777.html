				I agree with you TheLostHermit777, I think they should open up at least a few other forums for newbies to post in, such as perhaps technical support and rumor mill, to allow more reason to post and give newbies a chance to express their opinion. After all, how many scammed newbies do you think were unable to post in a rumor mill thread because of this rule?

There are people who have bots (BitSwing) that mass post here. They&#039;re limited to the number of forums where Newbies can post because they don&#039;t want to invest the time in getting to 50 posts first.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a difficult hurdle, just enough to discourage bot spammers.

				Good point. I think the limit should be reduced to 10, after all there&#039;s post verification so spambots can&#039;t post. Then after 50 posts, lift the verification.
