				If u are looking for lsd look no further than tessellated. I have been eating acid for years, so that being said...tonight I took 2 of tess&#039;s tabs and tripped hard. Granted I can get lsd with no problem for cheaper, but in the end paying alittle more was well worth it

				sweet, I would like some xanax, but also interested in lsd, weed and mdma depending on what the mood is :D<br />now EnterTheMatrix is asking to FE, which im a bit concerned about, I chose a vendor who did not require an FE as my frist purchase, and i was under the belief that i wouldnt need to FE, the ESCROW system seems very fair to me.....<br />i have messaged ETM so see how it goes, I would really like to have a good domestic vendor i can go with though...ill check out tessalated

				Easiest thing to do is to wait for the item to arrive, test it out and then finalize and give feedback.<br />If the product was poor rate it so. If it turns out the product was good then rate it good.<br />Take advantage of the space to add comments telling why you chose feedback you did.

				yeah, my first order was with JesusOfRave, and i was very happy with that, and left 5/5 and great comment, considering going back to him, (or at least to international vendors) as it seems like domestic australian vendors are not so prolific and with the great rating the internationals have, EnterTheMatrix did seem to be a great vendor, but his feedback page at the moment is a bit of a concern, hence this thread, but if he does go through with my order and it all goes smoothly, I will give appropriate/excellent feedback.

				Also make sure you use escrow unless you trust the vendor 100%
