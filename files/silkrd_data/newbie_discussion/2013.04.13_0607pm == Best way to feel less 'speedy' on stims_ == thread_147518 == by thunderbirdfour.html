				I know I could google this but I&#039;ve got to get to 50 somehow so....<br /><br />It may seem like a silly question, but does anyone have any tips on how to feel less &#039;speedy&#039; whilst on stims? I can&#039;t really find a better word to describe it so hopefully you know what I mean. I took two 5mg dexies of a different brand than I usually have this morning, and after a few hours I wasn&#039;t really feeling much so I&#039;ve just had one more and now I feel good but...I don&#039;t know...my head isn&#039;t half a lucid as it normally is on dexies and I&#039;m feeling annoyingly jittery and rushed for just 15mg.<br /><br />Obviously the long-term solution is to stick to the brand I know, but does anyone have any suggestions for now? Normally I would just get on with it but I&#039;m trying to write an essay at the moment and it&#039;s not going well at all. Actually it&#039;s taken me about 20mins just to write this. I&#039;ve got some lovely hash that I&#039;m considering, but that probably won&#039;t help the essay situation. The only other thing I&#039;ve got is some xanax but I think that might push me too far in the other direction. So I don&#039;t know... I could eat some fruit/have a beer/go for a walk/stroke a cat...would any of these help? Any suggestions would be appreciated. To be honest I&#039;m quite enjoying the feeling and wasting time on the internet, but my common sense forcing me to at least try and write a coherent essay. So here I am.<br /><br />tldr: I&#039;m looking for ways to feel less &#039;speedy&#039; on dexedrine, if possible, and we&#039;re all trying to reach 50 posts. Hopefully we&#039;ll end up with something marginally better than spam :)

				Don&#039;t take stims if you do not want to experience the effects of stims. I&#039;m not quite sure how else to put it, to be honest.

				Smoke some weed or drink some alcohol to &quot;take the edge off&quot; so to speak. You could also do another activity while you peak and then write when you come down a bit. Back when I was in university I would take Adderall and go to the gym or go out and skateboard and then I&#039;d have less physical energy but tons of mental focus. Perfect for writing a paper.

				I like the idea of beta blockers, never tried them myself either. I do know the vendor Angelina sells Inderal, and I can vouch for her reliability. I&#039;ll have to give them a try sometime, I&#039;m really curious if they decrease the efficacy at all.

				I&#039;m starting to think that deviations from an optimal sleep cycle plays an important role in enhancing unwanted anxiety effects.&nbsp; In other words... I started forcing myself to wake up at 5:30 am which, in turn, eventually forced me to fall asleep earlier.&nbsp; And... I&#039;ve noticed a marked decrease in my adaptability to life in general and also drug experimentation.&nbsp; Just a thought... :)
