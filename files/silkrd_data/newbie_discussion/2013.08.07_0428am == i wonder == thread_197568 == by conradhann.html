				i highly doubt LE will ever get silk road, or they would have by now im sure, but imagine the type of movie that will be made about silkroad someday? i mean they make movies about all kinds of crazy things that happen in the world. a movie about silkroad and smuggling everything imagineable would be a top seller movie for sure

				Wouldn&#039;t surprise me, maybe there would probably need to be a bit more controversy surrounding it though I think, tons of people still don&#039;t know it exists, so it probably wouldn&#039;t appeal to enough people yet.&nbsp; They&#039;ve made one about Wikileaks, and there&#039;s a documentary about The Pirate Bay, so maybe, I&#039;d say there&#039;s more likely to be a documentary than a film though.

Obviously we all hope LE never gets SR, but by assuming that they never will, we allow ourselves to get less cautious with security, which is bad. Never assume LE will never get SR, because that&#039;s probably what the founder of Freedom Hosting thought, what the founders of the Farmer&#039;s Market thought, etc.<br /><br />As for an SR movie, I dunno how exciting it would be. They&#039;d have to make it so that the movie depicts SR in the same way that the movie Hackers depicts actual computer hacking.

				in my mind silk road would seem to be a bigger target than freedom hosting, unless maybe the LE is realising they wont win the war on drugs so their focusing elsewhere? we need to stay positive about silkroad, i think this community is farmore up to par with security than anywhere else. seeing as anytime something happens the community comes together to prevent future breakdowns

Freedom hosting was definitely a way bigger target than SR. Similarly, there have been leaked plans showing the NSA is now giving information to the DEA to target drug users. Things are ramping up against us, never assume otherwise.<br /><br />My honest prediction for the end of SR is an LE bust. I really hope it doesn&#039;t go that way, but that&#039;s just my prediction. Doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;ll stop buying though!
