				Unless I&#039;M the one that&#039;s tripping (I&#039;m high on an E, but not tripping, that&#039;s for sure), you mean Silk Road, &#039;cause you are on here?<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s very very much for real. Take a deep breath, and before you go drug-simple, slow down and read, read, read, the WIKI, the forums, the FAQs, and the vendor reviews. Take your time, be safe, and learn from what people have to say before you jump in. Forewarned is forearmed, as they say.<br /><br />And when you have really grasped it, start enjoying the goods! Welcome to the future, I haven&#039;t been disappointed yet.<br /><br />Take care.<br /><br />ps never access from a proxy. Use Tor, and silkroadvb5piz3r.onion ONLY!

				It is very real, and so are the consequences of not using it correctly! As Thekla1 stated be sure to be using TOR and the proper URL (The real Silk Road will NEVER request your pin at login so be sure the url you use is correct and not a phishing site!). Also, research PGP, Tails, VPNs, and read the SR Wiki (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) before even thinking about ordering! If you are even semi-computer literate then you should be able to set up a safe and secure Silk Road machine in no time. Don&#039;t let greed or fiending get in the way of safety!

It is pretty comprehensive. The link is to an SR Forum post so it&#039;s nothing offsite. If you search for &quot;buying bitcoin&quot; it is the 3rd or 4th one down right now.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
