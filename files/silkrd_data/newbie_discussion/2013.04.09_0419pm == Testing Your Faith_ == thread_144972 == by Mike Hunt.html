				Just wandering how many religious folks are here so please vote and be honest.<br /><br />Is there any fans of Bill Marr out there?<br /><br />How about fans of TheAmazingAthiest? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR72G8dRh4k<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with none of those fuckers although they do make some interesting points but I don&#039;t see how bashing someone&#039;s belief system is such a good thing. Live and let live

				If religion is for morality, I don&#039;t need a book to tell me what&#039;s right and wrong. Nor do I need the promise of an afterlife or reincarnation to be a good person.<br /><br />If religion is for the promise of an afterlife, do I want to spend the rest of eternity with religious fanatics in &quot;heaven?&quot; The people I&#039;d prefer to spend the rest of eternity with are probably going to &quot;hell.&quot;<br /><br />Why is religion filled with so much corruption and greed?<br /><br />If religion is there to answer the unsolved mysteries of the universe... why does it seem like science keeps doing that instead?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				There&#039;s so many logical fallacies and contradictions in all religions that it&#039;s pretty clearly bullshit. <br /><br />If someone came up to you and told you that a burning bush talked to them would you believe them? No fucking obviously not, they&#039;re delusional and having hallucinations. But when a couple thousand year old book tells you this story you believe it?<br /><br />Also science has already disproved so many things religions have said to be true.

				Thanks guys for sharing your thoughts +1 to everybody who post in my threads<br /><br />The Kybalion made more since to me and it&#039;s also where they got their ideas when they created that movie &quot;The Secret&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;WARNING:Clear net Link&quot; so dont be on TOR while scrolling this link<br /><br />http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/kybalion.htm<br /><br />The Kybalion is the secret information that was hidden from the world by the Knights Templar who are now known as The Free Masons and the link above is where it&#039;s at. It takes about 4 hours to read it and there are videos where there is a narrator who reads it word for word.<br /><br />I believe God meant for things to be the way they are because people were not ready to handle the truth 2000 years ago. I also Like the teachings of Napoleon Hill who came out with his scientific principle of being rich back during the depression. It was a high priced book at one time but now it&#039;s completely free on youtube.<br /><br />I am working on a new ebook that I am hoping to wake up people with and I&#039;m going to give it away for free
