				Well just placed my first order on Tuesday,actually 2 orders placed.<br /><br />One must already be sent as vendor said, and waiting on the other one to be shipped.<br /><br />Both are coke and if it;s as good as the vendors claim(i have the necessary EZ tests, cut&amp;purity), well, hopefully there&#039;ll be another review of some good coke batches :)<br /><br />*staring at the mailbox* :P

				I just placed my first order as well.&nbsp; Actually just a couple hours ago.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been going back and forth with the vendor, and he assured me if I paid express and got the order to him today by 3pm PST that I would get it by Saturday, though I haven&#039;t seen the order status update yet.&nbsp; I know he already had it packaged up and ready to go for me, but he hadn&#039;t yet got my address.&nbsp; Hopefully he&#039;s not having any issues getting into SR, as I know sometimes it times out a lot.&nbsp; I ordered some h, and will be running the entire 1.25gms through a couple of micron filters after mixing it with bacteriostatic water and I&#039;m going to put it in a sealed sterile vial for storage.&nbsp; Hopefully by saturday we&#039;ll have a new h review as well!
