				Just curious if anyone&#039;s like me and bets on sports with bitcoins.&nbsp; I use btcsportsbet.com and can vouch for them.&nbsp; The nice thing about betting with bitcoins is the ease of getting money into and out of your account.&nbsp; No more wire transfers from Jamaica (I used bet jamaica as one of my main books years ago when I was betting with cash).&nbsp; I used to have to go to the western union and put in some crazy foreign name to get the cash and they&#039;re telling you over the phone letter by letter like a 50 letter name lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s been a few months so I&#039;ve bet with bitcoin since I lost my shirt last go around.&nbsp; But I&#039;m a pretty big basketball fan and going to lay some coin on the heat tonight at -1.&nbsp;

				Yeah they accept only bitcoins and payout in only bitcoins.&nbsp; It does take a number of confirmations in the blockchain before you&#039;ll see the bitcoins though.&nbsp; So if you want to bet the 9:00 EST NBA game tonight, you&#039;d have to move quick to send bitcoins to your account because it takes about 3 or so hours when xfering coins in and out there.&nbsp; When the game is over they are pretty quick to payout your bets too.&nbsp; If you&#039;re betting a ton of games like I was a few months back you&#039;ll notice they payout in waves.&nbsp; Like on a college basketball or football saturday if you make 15-20 bets like I was (I don&#039;t recommend this, just pick a few and bet em big), I would notice some games were over for an hour or two before I&#039;d get credit for the win.&nbsp; They&#039;re not as quick as a typical book with payouts.&nbsp; There were a number of times when I had my entire balance pending in bets and wasn&#039;t able to bet a later game because they hadn&#039;t credited my earlier bets even though the games had been over for a good hour or two.&nbsp;

				Oh a couple more things you might want to know and I consider these negatives is their juice usually sucks.&nbsp; They change the juice a lot before the line actually moves.&nbsp; You won&#039;t typically see a -110 price just sitting there idle.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be at -111 to -114 to -118 before they move the lines.&nbsp; And you can only bet in increments of 0.25 bitcoins.&nbsp; 1 bitcoin is the minimum (edited - told you wrong initially) .&nbsp; Not sure what the max is but I&#039;d bet up to 500 on certain games.&nbsp;

				I love the idea of BC&nbsp; sports betting, but a $25-$30 min bet is a deal breaker for me. I mean, why not just let me bet any amount?<br />&nbsp;Min deposit-ok<br />Min withdrawal(except to close account)-OK<br />Min bet-deal breaker<br /><br />I mean why wouldn&#039;t I be able to bet .00000001 BC?<br /><br />

				Update:&nbsp; I informed you wrong.&nbsp; Minimum bet is actually 1 bitcoin now.&nbsp; Their previous minimum was the lowest increment and that was .5 bitcoins when bitcoins were worth 13 a shot.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s setup that way because that&#039;s how they programmed the site.&nbsp; And I bet whoever is running this site has gained some traction over the months and has a lot of people placing bets and probably wanted to create a minimum so they didn&#039;t have to have so much work to do and also take in a lot of juice at the same time.&nbsp; Just like our moneypak to bitcoin vendors on SR, they don&#039;t want to mess with less than $100.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what goes on behind the scenes there, but I have a feeling there is some sort of manual entry or score checking on the back side.&nbsp; The reason I say this is a bet I placed once that should have resulted in a push actually got credited to me as a win.&nbsp; So someone must have entered the wrong result.&nbsp; This wouldn&#039;t typically happen at a traditional betting site like bet jamaica and if it did they would recognize and correct it pretty quick.&nbsp;
