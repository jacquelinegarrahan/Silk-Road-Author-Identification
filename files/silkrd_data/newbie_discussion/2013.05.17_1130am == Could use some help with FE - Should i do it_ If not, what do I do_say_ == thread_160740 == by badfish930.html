				Since you are new, you have to thoroughly read the vendors profile for their buying guidelines. <br /><br />In your case find sellers that never require FE, regardless of purchasing stats. <br /><br />If youve an order already in with a vendor that you did not read enough of their profile, and they ask you to FE, they have the right to cancel your order if your breaking their rules and regulations for ordering with them.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				As a newbie you should buy from sellers with loads of transactions. They are less likely to screw you over when you FE. Then you can build up a bit of a reputation and wont ever have to FE again! Most vendors will ask you to FE if you are new. If you find one that doesn&#039;t then go with them.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Good luck!

				Generally try to avoid FE - but no rule without exception<br /><br />When your account is new some vendors require FE which I partly can understand (but only partly)<br />so it depends from whom you are buying - and then you ask here about references from us<br /><br /><br />I have a few vendors who requires FE even with my stat which is more than 40 transactions and no refund at all<br />so find your vendor and pop the question here and read the feedback at their shop from others - but of course there is a risk.<br /><br />

				You shouldn&#039;t have... Buying a couple ebooks and a lottery is usually enough for some vendors, about $15 is not a big price for having less chances of getting scammed.

				While the number of a vendor&#039;s positive feedback/transactions should be taken into account- it should not be a deciding factor. As a small vendor, I only have 42 feedbacks but they are all lengthy and wonderful because I always include extras, my shipping is quick and super stealth and I am on top of my communication- you are never wondering where an order is when you place it with me.<br /><br />Also, as a small vendor FE helps me keep my float down so I can keep buying product to offer here. I just had 2 new people I took a risk on and over $600 in escrow until they let it auto-finalize. While thats not much to the big vendors to us small vendors that hurts our business and therefore our ability to supply you with product. <br /><br />Just my thoughts :)<br />
