				Never used H before, just bought a little bit of #3. Have two questions- 1) Can I snort the shit or do I have to smoke it? 2) How much to snort the first time?

				geez! i have done H for a couple years and it goes like this: #4 is the salt form HCl and #3 is the freebase form. #4 can be smoked, snorted, or shot. best to shoot it if you ask me, 10mg a dose is good for shooting, more for smoking or snorting. #3 can be snorted, or smoked, and even shot. the difference is that #3 is not water souble so you have to add a little bit of lemon juice or vinegar to it to get it to dissolve in the water to draw it up. be carefull tho, and H is the most addictive drug i have ever done. GOODLUCK

				You&#039;re better off smoking it if you don&#039;t want to overdose as you can guage the effects better. It&#039;s very easy to OD if you&#039;re a first time user and i very nearly OD&#039;d the other week- having used for 20 yrs on and off - by smoking crack and smoking H at the same time. Well, the coke left the marriage first and I was a drooling, headachey, puking wreck as the (very pure) smack kicked in. The paranoia that I had OD&#039;d gave me an adrenaline rush that kept me awake until the nausea became actual vomiting and then I could go to bed without fear of choking on my vomit in my sleep.&nbsp; Not fun. It&#039;s a horrible feeling when you start to OD. I used to IV regularly (couple of grams daily) and OD&#039;d twice but it&#039;s way easier to do when you don&#039;t have a tolerance. Scary shit. If you snort it and you do too much you&#039;re fucked- see Uma Thurman&#039;s char Mia in Pulp Fiction. I agree with the person above who says it&#039;s the most addictive drug ever. Even when you hate it and swear to stop when you&#039;re doing it, when you aren&#039;t on it absence makes the heart grow fonder; be fucking careful and steer clear if you don&#039;t want to wind up with a life-long monkey on your back is my advice.

You can smoke, snort, shoot, and hoop any strength of heroin. The numbers just tell you how strong and where its from. The best is #4, which is china white (from golden triangle), than goes #3 (pakistan/afghanistan), #2 (also pakistan/afghanistan), and #! (black tar, mexican) which is the worst of em all. People who say that their afghan dope is #4 are full of shit, no offense to them.

HOLY FUCK be carefull
