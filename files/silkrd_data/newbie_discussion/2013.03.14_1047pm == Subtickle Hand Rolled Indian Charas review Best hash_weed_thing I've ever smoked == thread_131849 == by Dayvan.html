				The best hash/weed/anything I&#039;ve I ever smoked, I smoked some tasty charas in India and this is better. Soft and smooth and deep and sweet and potent. Super relaxing high, very pleasant heavy body and jolly mind completely at ease with itself. Amazing price, best for hash/weed I have found in the UK by so so much compared to the 6 others I&#039;ve tried MrCronk, Budworx.... these guys have just been no where near as good and some have just not delivered so my refund rate is high but Subtickle still trusts me and delivers super fast (2 days) and came in at 5.4g overweight and with very stealthy very awesome free gift (I wont say cause it makes it less stealthy). Thank you Subtickle I am going to buy as much of this stuff as I can :D

				The taste is a lot more subtle than most hash, not spicy like Afghan or something, just really smooth and sweet and kinda earthy. Very mellow and tasty.

				Subtickle came through with some great smoke, very mellow and earthy flavours that takes you straight back to the beaches of India! Also had some nice Moroccan from the Scurvy Crew (their opium is awesome to!! :-[) <br /><br />Will definitely return for more, I see Subtickle also has a few more items on the shelves, will be trying some soon!

				Best weed I ever smoked was my first harvest of White Widow. After all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into my two plants, the realization of accomplishing my goal and taking that first toke was magical. Also, it was wicked potent and tasted a little bit like tea/lavender. Hard to describe but I smoked so much that day that I passed out on the bus and missed my stop by a whole lot. <br /><br />:)
