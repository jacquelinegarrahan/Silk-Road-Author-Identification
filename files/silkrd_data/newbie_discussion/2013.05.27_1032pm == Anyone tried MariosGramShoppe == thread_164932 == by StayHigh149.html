				I&#039;m wondering in anyone out there has any experience/ input about this vendor&#039;s cocaine.&nbsp; His prices are good, but not too good to be believable, and the picture in his posts looks like something actually taken by the vendor, not copied and pasted from elsewhere on the internet.&nbsp; I am hesitant because there aren&#039;t too many buyer reviews out there and the minimum purchase quantity is an 1/8.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any input appreciated.

				i&#039;m also very curious about this listing.&nbsp; an eightball for about 250 sounds pretty good if he&#039;s legit and he&#039;s selling uncut rocks.&nbsp; anybody who has dealt with him please let us know!<br /><br />i just find it strange that all 4 of his listings are the exact same price.&nbsp;

				MARIO!<br />alright - got the gear so here we go.<br />ordered late thursday night, mario said he was having problems logging in to SR on friday so i think it shipped saturday afternoon.&nbsp; got the package today (wednesady)&nbsp; so that&#039;s pretty standard priority mail time for where i live.&nbsp; <br />Stealth was impeccable.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t get lazy after you&#039;ve been around the road for a while Mario - THIS is how gear should be packaged!!<br />Ordered an 8ball. weight was slightly over. got one BIG, shiny, beautiful rock.&nbsp; <br />Quality for the price - honestly the best i&#039;ve ever had from the road.&nbsp; I think it was priced somewhere around 240-250 (not sure with BtC rates)&nbsp; and I don&#039;t mean &quot;best for the price&quot; i&#039;ve ever had, i mean the best coke i&#039;ve gotten off the road.&nbsp; i&#039;ve bought from many vendors, almost all of the top guys.&nbsp; even some of the crazy priced 400-500 a ball stuff.&nbsp; This stuff is better, and priced the way coke should be priced.&nbsp; The only regret i have so far is that i didn&#039;t buy more!<br />So I send my thanks and warmest welcome to Mariosgramshoppe.&nbsp; I will most definitely be back for more. <br /><br />If you&#039;re on the fence about buying from a new vendor, I hope this helps sway you to give these guys a shot.&nbsp; VERY glad I did.

				Thanks for the reply zbones.&nbsp; I decided to pull the trigger shortly after posting this thread originally.&nbsp; I mean after all, Mario&#039;s prices for an 8 ball are cheap by silk road standards, worst case scenario I&#039;d end up with a ball of coke that wasn&#039;t as good as I wanted it to be.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wow was I wrong there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve purchased from about 10 or 12 vendors over the past year and this is the best quality coke I have ever gotten off of SR.&nbsp; Glad I ordered when I did, people are clearly catching on, Mario sold out within a day of my purchase I&#039;m pretty sure.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mario, I&#039;m not sure exactly how you are doing it, but I hope you can keep this up.&nbsp; If your prices don&#039;t go through the roof and your customer service/ shipping speed stays on point I have a feeling you will soon have more buyers than you know what to do with.

				exactly how i felt stayhigh.&nbsp; i&#039;ve got good stuff from other vendors for sure, but the service/stealth/quality coupled with the price is going to be hard to beat here.&nbsp; &nbsp;this coke is just great. it seems like with coke on the road, it&#039;s always missing something.&nbsp; i won&#039;t name names for the negatives, but it&#039;s usually one of the 3 things - the quality isn&#039;t consistent, the prices rise or are wayyy too high to begin with, or the stealth is questionable. the only coke vendor i can really compare them to (in a good way) is MarloStanfield, but even he has raised his prices.&nbsp; and this coke is pure fire.&nbsp; i tried rationalizing paying outrageous prices due to the convenience of the road, but it gets really old.&nbsp; couldn&#039;t be happier with mario right now, hopefully they can keep up as well as maintain the totally professional product/prices.&nbsp; there&#039;s no reason to gouge people for +$400...GOOD LUCK GUYS!

				got my 2nd package today.&nbsp; it took a little longer than last time, no fault of MGS though.&nbsp; it was postmarked when they said it was in transit.&nbsp; the coke looks/smells like straight fire once again, this time it is a little off-white in color.&nbsp; haven&#039;t tried any - it is tuesday morning after all guys...&nbsp; i&#039;ve done more than my fair share, this is good stuff.&nbsp; their packaging is top-notch.&nbsp; the package itself was a little beat up and even had a small tear in it, but if you see how this stuff is packaged you&#039;d know i wasn&#039;t concerned at all.&nbsp; <br /><br />thanks MGS!&nbsp; another flawless transaction - keep it up!

				So, after reading all the stellar reviews for Marios C, I just had to give it a go and placed an order today. Now, I was cutting it pretty close, Mario was just about sold out when I contacted him letting him know that as soon as my bitcoins showed up in my SR wallet I&#039;d place an order. We all know how long it can take for those BTC&#039;s to show up in our wallets, especially when it&#039;s important and you need them. MGS went WAY out of his way, waiting for my funding to arrive so I could make my purchase today, of his last bit of C that he was holding for me, I mean he waited hours for me when I know he could have just sold it to someone who had the BTC&#039;s ready to go.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure I actually fucked up his afternoon while he waited for me. Then, when my funding finally showed, he not only took the order today, which was all I was hoping for, but, he processed it AND got it in the mail fotr me, in freakin transit. . Without even sampling the product yet, I&#039;d say we&#039;ve got ourselves a new-ish major player in the C vendor category. Unbelievably eager to make the customer feel like the only customer that matters, the most important customer in his customer base, combined with out of this world pricing , puts MGS in the major leagues. Granted, I haven&#039;t sampled yet, but, I just can&#039;t see a vendor that tries so hard , combined with the already posted excellent feedback not coming thru with A+++ shaley fire. <br />Thanks Mario for dealing with what I know was a pain in the ass for you today, that PIA&nbsp; being me and my slow assed SR wallet funding transaction. <br /><br />*********Will update when sampled . I have complete confidence that the Fire will be Fire!!!*********<br /><br />Thank You MaqriosGramShyop!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				Just want to give props to MGS for providing some good quality coke at a very competitive price. I like that the picture and description is updated with each batch, so you know what to expect. I wish more vendors would do this.&nbsp; They&#039;re also quick to ship and package well.&nbsp; I&#039;m still working my way through my last order, but this new batch looks quite enticing.

				Last batch was fantastic; have a few balls on the way in of the &#039;fluffy&#039; batch and I can&#039;t help but be nervous.&nbsp; We ordered for a festival so it was all or none.&nbsp; I really like this vendor and trusted his declaration of &#039;best batch yet&#039; and there is a certain comfort in someone picking up a brick at a time.&nbsp; Ordered from bcpltd, Marlo, 10Toes, and Mario and Mario is definitely best quality/dollar.&nbsp; I was in love with Marlo but his vendor page is full of too much drama for me. 10Toes is really good but 100/g really starts to add up. Keeping fingers crossed for new fluffy batch!

				I just wanted to let everyone know I agree with what everyone has said.&nbsp; Mario is a def a new major player in the game.&nbsp; I ordered from both batches and it is awesome.&nbsp; He even shows up as the number 4 or 5 guy in the best selling cocaine listings.&nbsp; I wish he would throw some bulk deals up though.. but still $500 for a quarter is not bad at all.&nbsp; I hope I see his new listings up tomorrow or the next day.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to order it as soon as he&#039;s up!!
