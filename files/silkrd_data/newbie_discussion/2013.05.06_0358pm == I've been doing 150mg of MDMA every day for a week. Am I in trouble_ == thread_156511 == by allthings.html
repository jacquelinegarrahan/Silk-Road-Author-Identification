				New user, on vacation with limited-time access to MDMA. <br /><br />I know you&#039;re supposed to space it out but I&#039;ve been taking one tab of 150mg almost every day for the last week and I might keep doing so until the end of next week. <br /><br />So far the effects are good every single time and I&#039;m not having any problems, but I&#039;m worried I might be messing up my ability to produce serotonin in the long run. <br /><br />Has anyone here been in a similar situation? I would like to hear your thoughts and experiences. <br />

				It&#039;s not a great idea, but you&#039;ll probably be fine after a few weeks or a month.&nbsp; You may even experience no lasting effects at all when you stop.&nbsp; Everybody&#039;s body is different.<br /><br />I have a friend who was taking +/- 800 mgs (via pressed pills) nearly every day (with week breaks here and there when his supplier ran out) .&nbsp; He was doing this for about 9 -10 months and taking a common SSRI daily (escitolopram) at the time.&nbsp; He stopped eventually and said it took about a year to get back on an even footing mentally.&nbsp; Not surprising

				Not sure if troll...or just stupid. The bare minimum you should wait between rolls is 2 weeks. I had a stretch of about 3 months where I did bk-MDMA (less potent) at least once a week and eventually my memory got fucked. It&#039;s back to normal now.&nbsp; Do too much molly and you won&#039;t be able to enjoy anything without being on drugs.

				You should really limit it to once a week, and even just once or twice a month.&nbsp; This gives you enough time to reach normal serotonin levels after taking MDMA.<br /><br />You probably aren&#039;t going to stop taking it for the time being, until you are out of the area at least.&nbsp; In that case, you should know that the come down—when you stop taking it—is going to feel like shit.&nbsp; Emotionally and physically, you are going to feel like shit for at least a week.<br /><br />Binging like this can really fuck up your body&#039;s serotonin regulation.&nbsp; Your body will get used to the excess serotonin and will produce less to counter that.&nbsp; It&#039;s not something to make a habit of binging on.

				Well, I wouldn&#039;t really recommend that. Using MDMA too frequently can make you permanently lose the &quot;magic&quot;.<br /><br />Back when I was 16 I got my hands on a decent amount of MDMA for the purpose of selling. Well, I ended up using it more than selling it and before I knew it I was snorting that shit all day and night for a few weeks until my parents went through my shit, found it, and threw it out. At this point, buying regular amounts of MDMA wasn&#039;t worth it anymore, as I would hardly feel anything. So I moved on to other drugs (mainly heroin). Two years later I decided to try MDMA again, and damn was that ever disappointing. I swallowed about 300mg, and I was clearly fucked up for a little while. I was talkative, clenching my jaw, really open to sharing my feelings, and my eyes were shaking all over the place - but there was no happiness or euphoria.<br /><br />So, I&#039;d say be careful if you&#039;re going to be using MDMA so often. Actually, preferably just take a break and let your body recover. If I could go back and stop myself from using so much, I would. Feeling the happiness I got from MDMA was one of my favorite feelings, and it makes me sad that I&#039;ll never feel that again. ( Oh well, still got heroin to make me feel good&nbsp; ::) )<br /><br />And what do you mean by limited-time access to MDMA? You do realize you&#039;re on the silk road, right? You can have the stuff mailed right to your house!&nbsp; ;D

				Everyone has given awesome advice. Not the best thing you can do to your brain function, but also if you are really on top of proper nutrition and take the proper vitamins and what not, you will at least minimize the damage done.

				Just stop, like maybe you wont feel too bad because you have a fresh brain on your hands, but chances are if you keep going and don&#039;t have an episode you will still be dealing with elevated anxiety, depression, or irritability on some level. It really does suck chemically fucking up yourself emotionally to that extent. A lot of us have been there, I know its a super awesome feeling but doing it that much not only forms bad habits for the future, but you are messing with things like serotonin downregulation and all of that oxidized dopamine going through your system is doing more damage than you really know. A lot of can take up to seven years to level out again to 100 percent if it isn&#039;t just permanent.<br /><br />Just get into the habit of shooting after some self-control and savoring the feeling for like once a month, which is safe. And not too long of an interval when you really think about it.

				this is a very bad idea <br />think of the analogy of you brain like a gas tank and serotonin is the gas<br />twice a month runs your tank a little under halfway<br />it takes time to replace serotonin naturally, you can aid it with the help of 5htp and sleep <br />but at the same time I think you are misusing MDMA and should really look into WHY you are doing it this many times in a row, I understand this is an escape but you whatever you are avoiding will be 10x worse when you either run out of pills or run out of serotonin

				to be honest - I&#039;m surprised you are still able to roll properly after doing it every day. I find that I have no serotonin left after my 3rd night in a row.<br />I would seriously suggest that you are wasting your molly.

				MDMA is a beautiful drug but you need to treat it with respect! You are likely doing yourself harm when you take it so often and it will definitely ruin the experience for you. Please be safe and take at least 2 weeks off in between rolls, and preferable more. You will be enjoying it much more. Maybe try some alternative to alternate. I like 2c-b, which certainly is not a replacement for MDMA but does resemble it in some ways with the advantage that it doesn&#039;t deplete your serotonin. And it certainly has it&#039;s own beauty!<br /><br />Good luck!<br />

				Are you in trouble? So long as this is an isolated event, which it appears to be, i don&#039;t see any long term problems. You will however very likely experience short term problems related to reduced seritonin in your brain. I expect you&#039;ll feel tired and groggy, and also feel somewhat disconnected from things. At least that has been my experience.<br /><br />You should try and learn from this experience. If you were to dose at this level consistently, then you would be headed for trouble.

				Yes, that&#039;s too much without a break, bro. Lay off it for a month or so, eat healthy, exercise (this is really important, it helps serotonin production) and take vitamins. If you do that, you&#039;ll be fine. I&#039;ve had binges before but have always recovered. Just be smart. You only get one brain.

				Is it really that much of a problem even with just doses of 1 tab at a time? <br /><br />Most people I hear talking about having problems are saying they were taking from 300mg to 1g regularly for long periods.

Make sure you get great nutrition and enough sleep when you stop.

				Hey I am going to second most of what has been said here. I have been a long time user of various drugs and you must reserve the greatest respect for them or pay a heavy toll. That said, 4-7 days of once daily use is likely to set you up for one hell of a hangover, even after sleeping for 12 hours strait, you will wake up and feel like the earths gravity has just increased by 4 fold, and have a banger of a headache (it will be severely worse if you haven&#039;t stay properly hydrated and eaten well). Then it is quite probable that a depression will set in, hopefully you are not having issues with such kinds of mental health, as that can set off a really bad one. Then after a few days you will start to feel normal again. No lasting damage unless you do this stuff regularly like binging once a month for years, that could start to cause some change in Neuroplasticity (physical changes in the Brain, but in this case not good), causing all kinds of issues from memory on up. But that is only in hard core use for prolonged periods. Remember the Brain is a very resilient and complicated Organ. Also MDA and MDMA are more complicated then acting on just the Serotonin Receptors, they also hit Norepinephrine and Dopamine ones, thus the Euphoria and Stimulating effects etc. In short, I would not recommend more then once a week in the Summer, or during Festival season, and then break for the rest of the year, and as long as you stay healthy and fit you will be fine.<br /><br />At least that is my non-expert opinion ;-)<br /><br />Stay safe,<br /><br />mushmold

				Good response. Thanks. I knew that once a week to once a month is the conventional wisdom, but sometimes you&#039;ve got to go a little overboard. Small doses once a day for a week or two (with days off mixed in) probably won&#039;t kill me. I see what you all mean about the comedown, but I don&#039;t mind that. I kind of enjoy the swing from euphoria to being bummed out. It&#039;s a good stimulus to thought and reflection. :)
