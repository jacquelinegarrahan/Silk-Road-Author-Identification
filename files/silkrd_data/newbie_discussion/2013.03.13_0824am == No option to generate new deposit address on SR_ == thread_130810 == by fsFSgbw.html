				I haven&#039;t been on SR in a while, but I came back the other day to put in some BTC and make a purchase or two. However, I can&#039;t seem to find the button to reset/create a new deposit address. Now when I go to &#039;Account,&#039; there is a link to &#039;Click here to make a deposit&#039;, which goes to a page with the following text:<br /><br />--<br />Warning: Read this before making a deposit to your account<br />Your PIN is required to make purchases, withdraw funds from your account, and make important changes to your account. If you forget your PIN, or give it away to a phishing site impersonating Silk Road, any funds you deposit to your account will be irretreivable.<br />Before depositing any funds, you should change your PIN and password on your SETTINGS page. If you are unable to change them because you&#039;ve already forgotten them, you must create a new account and try again.<br />Once you are ready, send your deposit to this address:<br />[an address here]<br />--<br /><br />There doesn&#039;t seem to be any option to generate a new, different address, and I couldn&#039;t find anything to that effect anywhere else in settings, etc. Has this option been removed? Is anyone else experiencing this?<br /><br />Thank you for any input you may have.

				Bumping to front.<br />Also worth mentioning that I tried to search for this on the forums but couldn&#039;t find any answers.

				I have the option of getting a new address, as I always did on my &#039;Account&#039; screen. I&#039;d say what you are seeing is there because you have been inactive for a while and it is just a heads up to make sure you know your PIN. Once you make a deposit, i&#039;d imagine it will go back to normal for you. I am just guessing that this is the case and it does make sense, especially if they are no longer able to reset PINs for users.<br /><br />I hope it all works out OK for you :)
