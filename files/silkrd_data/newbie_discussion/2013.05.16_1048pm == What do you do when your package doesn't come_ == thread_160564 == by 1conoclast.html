				When a package&#039;s tracking number says delivered but never shows up in your box, what do you do?&nbsp; <br /><br />If I miss one package then I feel like I can&#039;t use that address anymore because you don&#039;t know where your package really is.&nbsp; Would you feel safe using that address again?

				If given a tracking code I would never view it cuz they will notice if you view it from the tor network and you dont want to without it im guessing cuz its illegal. So better luck next time dude. Read up and safety and tips for stuff like this

				You&#039;re saying the usps can see who is typing in a specific tracking number?<br /><br />Crankersore, don&#039;t you feel it necessary to get a new shipping address after a package doesn&#039;t get delivered?

				Yes, LE can see everything you do on your comp on the clearnet if they want to pretty much. I used forwarding services to get my packages. Look into it

				I suppose it depends on what you think happened to the package.&nbsp; Did it actually ship?&nbsp; Was it stolen by postal worker, discover by LE, or stolen out of your mailbox?&nbsp; Did you use a real name and address?&nbsp; Are you the only one who gets the mail at that address?

I have been trying to purchase things online now instead of at the store when possible so i have a steady stream of legit letters and parcels coming in. <br /><br />i agree with the people above about checking tracking numbers. i like to get shipping with tracking but i never check it. its just a security measure incase it never shows up. if i thought there was a chance my package was intercepted by LE i would not ship there anymore.
