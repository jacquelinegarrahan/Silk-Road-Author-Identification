				... and a greatly OVER-PRICED quarter of mids to boot? UndergroundSyndicate probably sells good mids, I&#039;m sure, but after fees and shipping you&#039;re looking at about $60 for 7g of mid-grade weed. Say whaaaaa??

				The only reason I&#039;d ever buy mids is for cookies or bho, but not for that price.

				I was thinking the same thing. Thurgood Jenkins QP should be on that first list, great weed and a great guy to do business with.

				Hmm.. I see. Still, though, when you can pay just 30 dollars more for a quarter of AAAA+ quality bud I just don&#039;t see the reason for mids being the second strongest selling cannabis item. Especially when, even if you were thinking about buying mids to cook with, you can get an ounce of good trim/shake on SR for about $100 even.

				in my opinion its about the money, alot of people who are just being exposed to SR are mainly kids and 19 year olds watching the news... which is even hard to believe that...<br />but most of these people probably either a.) don&#039;t wanna spend money for quality weed&nbsp; or b.) just don&#039;t have enough to pay for it.

				my thought is:&nbsp; there are some older guys who like the mid-grade stuff, and don&#039;t mind paying to have it shipped to em in a way that makes em comfortable.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(<br /><br />some of this &quot;high test&quot; weed that is sold here is too much for some of these guys in their 50&#039;s. personally i like the best of the best.&nbsp; price is almost not an issue but security is #one!<br /><br />

				It&#039;s probably the most (quantity wise) they can afford, that will still do the job.
