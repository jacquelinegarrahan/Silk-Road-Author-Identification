				&nbsp;:)[EDIT: MY VENDOR ACCOUNT IS HERE http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/853d62ae10] :)<br /><br />Hi, Just trying to work out if this is viable first, If it is I will buy a vendor account. I am not taking orders yet, will not take any orders until I have a vendor account.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to start a service offering bitcoins for cash in the post, I am not really looking to make any profit on this. Just to offer a service to the UK members that doesn&#039;t seem to be readily available. Would many be interested in this service? It would be completely anonymous on your part with the coins being sent straight to your silk road acc or a wallet of your choice.<br /><br />To start with I would obviously have to build the trust of forum members which I am happy to do by sending half the coins first, with the rest on receipt of the cash. and vice versa for btc to cash. Only small orders to begin with (£200 max) until I have built some trust then larger orders may be accepted. The coins will be sold at Mt.Gox&#039;s average rate at the time of the deal. Again, to begin with trusted forum members or those with good buying stats would be the only ones accepted until trust is built. I may be able to work out deals below mtgox&#039;s average with trusted forum members for good reviews here.<br /><br />So, would this be worth doing? Are there enough UK members that would be interested? And what do you think of the idea? I&#039;d really like to hear comments or suggestions below. If there is enough interest I will by a sellers account.<br /><br />(EDIT: Just transferring funds to buy vendor account)<br /><br />Thanks<br />BTC4C UK

				Thank you and please do update this post after your cash is received and remaining bitcoins are sent. As the agreement I came to (read as: was haggled by) with the buyer above. you can buy your coins at for £3 less than Mt.gox&#039;s average price. which means you get more bitcoin for your cash. Not much, but it all adds up.

				I&#039;m interested in this too. With Blockchain.info no longer accepting bank transfers I&#039;m out of reliable, convenient ways of getting coins. I think the future of bitcoins in the UK is cash for coins, as from what I gather the banks are making it as difficult as possible to buy via bank transfers. I&#039;ll check out your listings.

				[FORUM MEMBER] ABBY<br /><br />Could not reply to your PM, kept getting error<br /><br />That would be a little far to travel I&#039;m afraid<br />Cash is safe through the post as long as you send registered and its insured up to £500. <br />Also, there is nothing illegal about buying bitcoin so you could technically report it as a crime if you didn&#039;t receive. <br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the message. Hope you reconsider<br />&nbsp;:)

Banks are a nightmare because of their anti money-laundering rules and regs. There is certain amounts which must be reported and things they look for and legally have to report. Regular bank transfers (especially high value) can be looked at as suspicious especially where bitcoin or bitcoin exchanges are concerned. Also there seems to be some kind of crack down (as you mentioned) with exchanges UK bank accounts. <br /><br />

				Not a problem at all. Again, if you use registered post the probability of it being stolen is very low (less than 1 percent) as recorded delivery&#039;s are tracked by royal mail. If it goes missing it will have to be explained and as you are insured for up to £500 while using recorded delivery you can put in a claim to royal mail to get your money back if it did manage to go missing. <br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I notice you mention sending 50% of the BTC before the cash arrives to those with good feedback. What sort of feedback are you looking for? The more I think about it, the more I like this idea. I&#039;ve not been on the Silk Road for very long though but my buyer stats are as follows: <br /><br />Total transactions: 10<br />Total spent: ฿13.54<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 1 month

				Damn. Came back to SR after a couple of weeks away and find I can no longer buy BTC from blockchain<br />It&#039;s now almost impossible for me to buy them and I will never fall for any scams. Not saying this is but I can&#039;t afford to send money in the post. I only want £20 worth for some hash. Check out my buyer stats they are excellent<br /><br />Cheers

				as you have only been a member one month and your stats although good, are not a good reflection of your character over a short amount of time.&nbsp; I would only send 25% of the coins upfront to you though to prove I mean business. I&#039;m not saying you would .... But any non-payers will be reported to SR as a scammer, which could result in you getting your account frozen or banned <br /><br />But I hope most buyers are honest anyway :)<br /><br />Thanks

				I would definitely be up for this method I am sick of all the fucking about and electronic paper trail, I know from having almost 100 purchases on silk road that the majority of the time the post is absolutely fine, recorded even more so. Only had two orders that didn&#039;t arrive, 1 through the vendor not putting the correct amount of postage stamps on (school boy error) and the other was from Spain for opium and simply didn&#039;t show up. <br /><br />I&#039;ll wait until there is some good feedback before I take the plunge myself but if the feedback is good then I&#039;ll become a regular customer. <br /><br />I am very cynical by nature and I do question the business model of this operation in that there appears to be a fairly limited number of coins at your disposal so it&#039;s probably not built to last, unless you&#039;re a UK vendor that is now operating this way to swap their coins for cash? Maybe you&#039;d prefer not to say but the more honest you are with us the more comfortable I feel dealing with you and I buy a fairly reasonable amount of coins on a monthly basis!

I can understand your decision to wait on feedback. I&#039;m not going to open it up on a public forum or elsewhere but I should have enough coins for the foreseeable future unless I get a sudden influx of very large orders all at once which is very unlikely. In the unlikely event I ran out of coins I would buy more from an exchange to cover orders &amp; myself to continue trading. and will also be trading cash for bitcoins soon as well so will accumulate more through these transactions. <br /><br />Hope to see you as a customer soon, a regular one would be even better.<br /><br />Thanks for the interest

				And here I am as well. <br /><br />Honestly ladies and gents, I was very skeptical at first, wary that there had been a few SR BTC selling vendors that simply scammed people out of their money, but I&#039;m extremely happy to report that this wasn&#039;t the case here. I left a review on the vendors page, as well as creating an entirely separate thread as I&#039;d thought my experience warranted it. <br /><br />A fantastic deal, this vendor gets my firm seal of approval. I&#039;ll be sending the cash via Special Delivery in the morning. Thanks again for providing to me what I hadn&#039;t thought was possible.

				I&#039;m going to message you directly on to your SR account but it makes more sense to discuss in the forum so I&#039;m just going to do it here. <br /><br />Lets say for arguments sake I have over 80+ purchases and only one refund, have spent a few thousand pounds and been a member almost a year, that you will forward me half the value of my BTC order of say £100 upfront on the basis of mutual trust that I send you the cash the next day via special/recorded delivery? I am happy to provide whatever evidence you need in terms of recorded delivery numbers or whatever, this is a good system for me I&#039;m bored of having to change methods every so often and the fees were getting silly plus it&#039;s more anonymous this way. <br /><br />I buy about £400/500 coins a month every month pretty much and I don&#039;t mind sending the cash or waiting a day or so to get the full balance it&#039;s just the stability I want, I just want someone reliable as it&#039;s getting frustrating not knowing if you&#039;ll be able to get an order on time or get the coins you need. It&#039;s taking the fun out of SR for me and it&#039;s certainly not going to stop me because nothing will when it comes to SR but it&#039;s getting kind of fiddly now! <br />

				as long as your buyer stats look good then yes 50% is given upfront with the rest on reciept of cash. As long as everyone stays honest and pays up then there is no reason why I will change this either. My aim is quality over quantity. I don&#039;t want to be a top 1% vendor I want to be known as someone who always delivers. Stability in transactions is definitely something I will strive to provide. I think it is a easy more anon way of trading coins.

				So I have 6 orders waiting on payment to us before their balance is sent to them. I just hope that all the buyers are honest and send their payment through or I might have to consider putting a higher rate on buyer stats for the 50% upfront. I&#039;ve only had to cancel one order so far which was for £200 from a member who had been here 3 days with 3 transactions. I have still said he can use the service but wouldn&#039;t recieve anything upfront.<br /><br />The kind of stats I&#039;m looking for is member for over a month, over 10 transactions with a decent amount spent. The reason is these kind of members are more likely to be honest and pay back because they do not want to have their funds frozen or account closed if I had to report them as a scammer and have to start all over again. <br /><br />If anyone has any questions or comments please pm me or post here<br /><br />Thanks

				Just to update everyone on my order - I placed an order last night/early this morning and the up-front amount was in my account within about 5 minutes (I agreed to take less than 50% up front, as although my stats are good, I&#039;ve only been a member for just over a month, which I think is perfectly fair.) Just sent my money off now and should hopefully have the rest of the coins by tomorrow, so I&#039;ll update then. So far I&#039;m very optimistic about this. <br />

				I&#039;m one of the people who sent my money out yesterday after ordering £100+ of btc. The money was set to arrive today, and sure enough, when I checked, the tracking said my money had been delivered and Silk Road showed my coins in my account. No problems at all here.

				My review for BTC4Cash UK... <br /><br />As some of you may know, or may have read about, tormail has been up and down quite a lot recently. Due to this, I lost my normal BTC guy, some of you may know him as BTCxUK. <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to lie, nor am i going to &#039;slag&#039; off BTCxUK. He was good and reliable, and cheap! But guess whats coming.. You&#039;ve probably guessed it, BTC4Cash UK is better in every single way. Not only is he an active vendor on SR now, which means he replies pretty much instantaneously to every single message, he&#039;s honest, cheap and very very very quick, as in not even a minute wait. <br /><br />For my first transaction, i needed £200 worth of BTC. My situation was dire, I couldn&#039;t get any BTC and I needed to place an order of around 1.7 BTC from a vendor on SR to receive for the weekend. I explained this to BTC4Cash UK and he was willing to transfer me the amount needed (so more than half of the BTC i ordered) which helped me out so much!! I, of course, after seeing how honest and reliable BTC4Cash was sent the money by recorded delivery the same day :) And guess what, the remaining 0.6BTC was in my account by 12 today. What more could you ask for!! <br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for a cheap, quick and reliable way go to BTC4Cash UK. <br /><br />Cheers again BTC4Cash UK!!!!!

				No problem. you should get on the forum more?!? !st post?! <br /><br />Anyway, thanks to everyone so far everything seems to be going just fine. Just so everyone knows I am building this round trust. Once you have paid for your order (or orders if your buyer stats are low) depending very much on your buyer stats you will be given a credit limit. This limit is the amount of coins you receive before you post out any cash from 25% to 100% and for now (unless you have brilliant stats I might reconsider) a limit of £250 per transaction. As I trust you more your limit will be raised. All non payers will be reported on SR and here on the forums. All coin prices are £3 below MtGox rates.

				So here&#039;s my review. Sent the money Yesterday and by the time I got home from work today the coins where in my account!<br /><br />5/5/ - Communication was spot on. Always quick to respond, infact replying faster then I was sending them :)<br />5/5&nbsp; -Price - As people have mentioned here I got more than what I paid for&nbsp; I paid for £50 worth - btc recieved are currently worth £54.61. Incredible what other vendors has this?<br /><br />So yeah would highly recommend, especially if your UK like me and are struggling to get hold of bitcoins<br /><br />Will be making more orders soon

				buzzin with the service from this vendor, got confirmation today the cash was received so overall a very successful transaction and will no doubt be using this vendor many times again. <br /><br />was worried at first about posting cash but the vendor was happy to put their trust in me and my stats and send the coins before i had even sent cash .... wasnt a massive amount of coins so wasnt a problem but this meant my only concern was that the cash was delivered but as instructed to use special or recorded delivery you cant fail ... and i could order my drug swiftly haha&nbsp; :o brucey bonus<br /><br />top vendor&nbsp; ;D

				It depends if you receive money upfront, if you do then both :) It can be either/or down to you .&nbsp; Obviously if you receive funds before cash is posted it is at the avg rate then with the rest being exchanged at the avg rate when cash is received. This way you get your moneys worth without worrying about the rate dropping while cash is on route.<br /><br />If its 182 I would only ask for 180 for ease of posting, and yes you can put it in a card if you like. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				I just used BTC4Cash and the guy couldn&#039;t have been more helpful, I was apprehensive at first just because it&#039;s an odd system that I am not used to although I have purchased previously with cash in the post for goods. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t get any coins up front at my own request because I wanted them all to come at once at the next days rate as the coins have fluctuated a bit as we all know, I was offered coins up front though. <br /><br />Sent the envelope at 4.30pm and a gave the guy a tracking number, woke up next day with coins in my account by midday. Got a good rate and all done in about 16 hours without any trail back to me whatsoever. <br /><br />I fully recommend the service it certainly worked well for me, I think it&#039;s the way forward in the UK now with the banks being pricks. <br />Please don&#039;t mess this guy around too much though because it spoils it for everyone, I&#039;d like to build up a relationship and if a smallish number of genuine people buy enough coins regularly then it can work for us all....<br /><br />Thanks again mate! ;)

Trying to find a way to get coins in the uk at a reasonable rate is near impossible.<br /><br />i dont need any coins now but its good to know you exist and seem legit for the next time i need some.<br /><br />just got a couple of questions:<br /><br />1) do you still trade coins at the mtgox average?<br />2) whats your average time it takes to complete a transaction with yourself (i.e you have cash customer has coins)?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its below MtGox rate (£3-7.50 below depending on how much you order) No other fees<br />Average time is less than a day, depending on when you post cash.

				Right, someone has paid and not sent me the tracking number...... If you have paid and I haven&#039;t confirmed receiving it could you PLEASE get in touch. <br />I need either the tracking number or at the very least how it was sent and the amount.<br />I can then confirm it, and also pay you out any coins if there is any outstanding! <br />Thanks<br /><br />Please update me with the tracking number once you&#039;ve sent it guys, makes things so much easier!!

				Done a couple of transactions with him so far seems like a friendly and honest guy obviously he could do a runner at any point or god forbid be involved in one of them infamous &quot;car accidents&quot; but im happy to continue with him as its a 50/50 split its a fair risk for buyer and seller.

				I used this service recently, sent cash on Tuesday and got the coins on Wed so very fast, and the coins are at a very good rate, for people in the UK it has become very difficult getting coins recently so this vendor is perfect. I chose not to have any coins upfront and have them all on receipt of cash. I would definitely use again and recommend to everyone.

				Really dissapointed youve decided that a temporary lapse in the sites availablity means that you can take no new orders. Set up a tormail address so at least customers that have used you before can still take advantage of your services when things like this happen. <br /><br />As i type this the site seems to be working fine.

				You don&#039;t actually believe he scammed anyone, do you? <br /><br />At least 50% of the cash is sent up front first. Anyone that&#039;s willing to do that shouldn&#039;t be a scammer. £5,000 worth - I doubt that. There were many, many successful buyers ordering from BTC4Cash UK, and there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever about the £5,000 scam. <br /><br />If there was any light to that accusation, surely, surely there&#039;d be a forum thread about it somewhere... Either it doesn&#039;t exist, or my search skills have completely diminished.

				I would like that to if the exchange rate isn&#039;t too high.<br />Would it also be available for other European countries?<br /><br />A bit of critique:<br />How can we do this safely? <br />When you get your bond back from SR what stops you from just keeping the money?<br />Is knowing the receiving address enough leverage to stop you from doing that?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re going to do that, most poeple in the community seem awesome but anyone can join SR and its forum.

				Hi BTC4CASHUK<br /><br />Hope you can help me out here. <br /><br />Have today signed up at SR and keen to go Xmas shopping... However I&#039;ve encountered the same nightmare I&#039;d imagine a lot of UK users have... getting hold of bit coins (anonymously.)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t made any transactions yet, I&#039;d like to buy 0.5 BTC to start me off, what would you charge for this, and what would you require up front.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to discuss on the forum or PM/email me if you&#039;d like,<br /><br />Cheers
