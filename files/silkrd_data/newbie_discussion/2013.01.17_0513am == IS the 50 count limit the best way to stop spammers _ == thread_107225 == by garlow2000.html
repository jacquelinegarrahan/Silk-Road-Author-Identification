				I wonder what kinda people are spaming, they must not have very much to do in their life. There is so much out there that we don&#039;t know about, if they put as much time as they did in spamming every forums they can get access to then this world would be a different place, along with what the internet, could maybe do.

				Remember in December when SR was down for days?&nbsp; Getting real info was extremely tedious because we had to sift through all those posts of people creating new personas to post conspiracy theories, spam, flames, and misinformation.&nbsp; As &#039;entertaining&#039; it may have been at first (ya right), I did expect something like this to happen eventually.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The problem is that the majority of people here are posting legitimately.&nbsp; It&#039;s the small minority-- spammers, kids, trouble-makers-- who ruin it for the rest of us. It&#039;s the same reason salvia divinorum became federally scheduled.&nbsp; No one gave a damn about it until it got bad press from people who advertized it-- posting youtube videos for instance-- or behaved stupidly in a way that drew public attention.

				10 posts can be done in like 5 minutes if they&#039;re just copy and pasting the same thing.<br />50 will take a bit longer and are mods really going to be looking every minute to be able to catch a new account thats spamming everywhere within 5min?<br />It sucks but its better than the spam everywhere.

				50 posts to stop spammers? I don&#039;t even think it would need to be 50 posts, maybe 5 or 10 would do for the most part.<br /><br />You will never stop i completely. As for the CAPTCHAs they are a joke now a days. There are services out there where you can pay pennies for every correct CAPTCHA entered. These services have several people that all day long all they do is get CAPTCHAs and type it in for you. This is for automated spamming.<br /><br />Don&#039;t ask how I know about such services.&nbsp; 8)

				The best way to stop spammers is to have a delay on all new threads created. A mod then briefly scrolls through &quot;pending&quot; threads and weeds out the spammers before confirming the legitimate threads. There are enough mods to make this idea feasible.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108854.0<br /><br />We need to get to 50 quickly because asking to forward our thread might take a while or will not be done at all.<br />SR could even simply move that topic to the right subforum to provide some service, instead of deleting post at actual time the chemicals were smoking and we were at the scene.<br />Account creation date is same time. We do not use the forums at all because of sick bastards being on here and having serious doubts about the integrity of SR.<br /><br />We do read. One person posted that ordering from SR is saver than in real life because you actually get what you order and can not be gunned down.<br />Risk on SR is that you can not even see what is really going on/being saved without your consent and (new) vendors have the ability to completely ruin, or even KILL people when and if they want to.<br /><br />After this we feel a lot saver buying on the streets. You can avoid camera&#039;s, come with 2 people and if you feel you need to, search for recording devices. Most dealers are not complete psychopaths though. And taking a lot of risk when selling to new customers. Which is why they sometimes demand introduction by a regular, trusted customer. Advantage is that they get their money immediately. But the prices are fair. On SR people still just list whatever the fuck they want and ask prices that are way too high. And sadly, people are actually so stupid as to buy it, give good feedback and reviews and do not realize they could have gotten 10 times the same amount on the streets.<br /><br />We do not trust SR or vendors anymore at all right now. Hopefully some miracle will happen but chances are 99,99% that will not happen. We will also advice against using SR to buy drugs as it can be very dangerous and lead to people dying.<br />They can raise commission how much they want. Raise vendor prices. They must get a lot of money each day while being untrue to what they claim. They keep a history of past transactions that have been finalized. For a pretty long time.<br />Would be saver to delete them with good deletion software.<br /><br />And maybe, just maybe this has some special forum coding that is required for onion sites. If not then this is the worst forum in dealing with spam that exists. Clear web websites do not have these problems.<br />Perhaps SR pay people to make those spam posts and now take retarded supposedly counter measures in order to seem legit.<br /><br />Fuck this all. Wake up people!

				With all respect to the attempt to thwart spamming and the energy that&#039;s going/gone into this, some of threads/posts I&#039;ve found most valuable or interesting on this board have been from people who have (or had at the time) &lt;50 posts. <br />Sometimes people just take a crazy notion to sit down for 70-80 minutes and write a careful, detailed, helpful post for a bunch of people they don&#039;t know... but it&#039;s relatively unlikely they&#039;re going to write 50 messages as a preamble.<br /><br />Quick off the cuff examples&nbsp; --<br /><br />Former Prosecutor… Ask Away.<br />HJAnslinger (43)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92097.0<br /><br />Former Postal Inspection Service Intern<br />janetreno (7 posts at the time the thread started)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=346.0<br /><br />Australian LE Report on BC/SR<br />Winters86 (7)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38319.0<br /><br /><br />Maybe lower post count and then approval?&nbsp; <br />Oh, look, there&#039;s a string of bitcointalks topics appearing right now.&nbsp; edit: which were slain with awesome swiftness :)

				The way I see it, if someone wants to write a detailed essay regarding information that&#039;s valuable to the forum then they could do it in the newbie section? Then someone could link the post in the Rumour Mill for other people to chime in. <br /><br />Not ideal but hey.<br /><br />This seems to be the most active forum as other people like myself are trying to reach 50 posts in order to join in with the other discussions!

				it&#039;s pretty effective at stopping newbie posters, I can imagine spammers having less resolve.
