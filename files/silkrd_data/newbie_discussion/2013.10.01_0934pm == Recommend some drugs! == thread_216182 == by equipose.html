				Along with SR; new doors to new substances has opened.<br /><br />Me and my friend usually Rolls MDMA, which is so far my favorite drug. We would like to try something a bit more... powerfull. I&#039;d like some visuals or a deep trip. I&#039;ve never messed around with anything else than cocaine, amphetamine, mdma or hash. <br /><br />Recommend something that we could have a lot of fun with. You&#039;re more than welcome to share experiances!<br /><br />Cheers.

				Try MDA, similar to MDMA with a psychadelic twist. Different people react a little differently to it. Or LSD, start low and in a good set + setting. They seem to fit your requests

				I mean, acid, right? It&#039;s definitely my favorite drug. I said rolls were my favorite drugs for years and years, but, really, acid is amazing. imo it really makes rolls looks like a shitty drug. So shitty, in fact, that I haven&#039;t in a while. I don&#039;t see the point. I would literally always rather trip. I haven&#039;t bought any acid on the road yet so I don&#039;t have any seller recs, but definitely pick some up.

				Do some acid with your mdma, very nice. Add a little speed for even more fun. Really great clubbing combo as long as you don&#039;t go overboard ;)

				Psychedelics all the way! If I had to chose one drug and that was the only drug I could ever use it would be LSD.<br /><br />LSD, depending on how you dose, can give you a relaxing day with your friends, or you can take 5 tabs to the dome and leave this planet. It really is awesome. I would suggest DMT, but not yet. You should experiment with shrooms and acid before you start hitting freebase DMT.<br /><br />PsychedelicSphere

				I know it&#039;s not something you&#039;d have to buy on the Road (although I would if a vendor was offering powder) but when I was in your shoes a few years ago, the next drug I tried getting my feet wet in on my quest to break into hallucinogens was DXM - dextromethorphan. Despite what a lot of less experienced users say (or users that don&#039;t happen to like dissociatives), DXM is much more than just getting fucked up on cough syrup. A good place to start is William White&#039;s DXM FAQ and the wealth of knowledge on Erowid. The next place I&#039;d check out is the Dextroverse forums - if there was a capital of the DXM universe that would be it.<br /><br />DXM is a very complex and extremely interesting, mysterious, and many-leveled drug to many different people, and personally I found getting experience with dissociatives helped prepare me for psychedelics like mushrooms and LSD immensely. Read up on it, if you&#039;re interested give it a try, and let us know what you think. If you have any questions about it I may not have all the answers but I am very experienced and will do my best to help you.

				Hi Equipose,<br />We would recommend DMT as an excellent introduction to psychedelics, due to its quick onset and short duration of intense experience.<br /><br />DMT is a very warm and loving journey, which will humble you. ;-)<br /><br />We encourage you to check our profile page ,as it has lots of hints, tips and recommendations.<br /><br />The research makes very interesting viewing whether or not you choose to try DMT !!!<br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />Machine Elves<br /><br /><br />

				MXE is a wonderful substance. Too bad about the quality drop since the ban. Still very good stuff though.

				dmt is in a league of its own, i love dmt but you gotta work your way up to it. i have a buddy he loves to eat shrooms with me, i had him try my dmt and he wont touch it again. so if these folks who are inexperinced with hallucinogens jump straight to dmt, it might scare them enough to not want to touch hallucinogens again. but on the other hand, if you can handle dmt or be humble enough to let dmt handle you, then you can handle any hallucinogen. again, just my opinion but stay away from the research chems.

				Like others have said, DMT and LSD are the way to go. LSD would be more suited to having a laugh with friends, in my opinion. For me, DMT is about spiritual introspection.<br /><br />There are heaps of psychedelics available on SR, but personally, I would stay clear of the Research Chemicals :)
