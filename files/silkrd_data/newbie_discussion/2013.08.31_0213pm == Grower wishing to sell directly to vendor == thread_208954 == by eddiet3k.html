				Hi all, <br />I&#039;m wondering if anybody has any advise on selling cannabis directly to vendors?<br />I produce good quality cannabis, mainly Pineapple Express, Diesel and Santa Marta (The citrus taste in skunk no.1). Its grown in top quality soil with top quality nutrients, no chemical insecticides or the likes, dried and cured, and its grown for taste/potency not for maximum $$$&#039;s. <br />I don&#039;t wish to sell the product in my local area and I don&#039;t want to become a vendor on SR Ideally I would like to sell to a 2 or 3 small vendors in cash.<br />Cheers all.

				Why not get some packing supplies and sell directly to the customers, cut out the middle man.<br /><br />I know a few growers who are now selling exclusively to the Road, it is such a safe option if done right and growers are the sort of people who know how to get things done.<br /><br />Dealing via tor/bitcoins helps growers from encountering undercover cops pretending to be someone they are not.

				Yeah I thought about selling on SR but that would mean 100-200+ letters per week to be posted, stealth packaging machines plus materials, envelopes and scales... All of which would constantly be needed on site. Add that to a grow operation&nbsp; = CPS convicting me as the leading role in a Category 1 operation of the&nbsp; production of Cannabis (Which at a starting point = 8 Years sentence).<br />Now, if I don&#039;t have any of the sales/SR stuff,&nbsp; have no plant debris to signify previous crops, no cash on site and a good lawyer; then its likely I&#039;ll get a labelled category 3, a lesser/significant role and sentenced with either a community order or up to 1 year.<br /><br />Finally, I have no idea how vendors do it... but... Having all your cash in the digital domain?!?! The thought of that scares the hell out of me. The only way that&#039;s coming out of bitcoin is through a bank account, and in turn documents how much cash you&#039;ve made and links it to a name/address/YOU, in a court of law that&#039;s like being caught red handed. <br /><br />

Meeting someone to make a FTF cash transaction for your buds is about as dangerous as it gets. You could either be meeting with a cop, or you could be the cop looking to meet with a SR vendor.<br /><br />By using the SR to sell then your customers never need to know who you are, whether they are a cop or not (LE bitcoins are good too!). You don&#039;t have to sell eighths if that is too much work. There are many buyers looking for bulk all the time. This means less packaging materials, less stress, and less time consuming. Selling in smaller amounts directly to end consumers means you will likely make 2x the profit you are currently seeing. Selling in bulk will probably fetch you 1.5x what you are currently getting. The stress of moving your product disappears as there is constant demand. Keep the packaging equipment and materials at a separate location so if the grow is discovered they don&#039;t find more evidence against you.<br /><br />Bank accounts aren&#039;t the only way to cash out bitcoins. Do some research and you will find many alternative solutions. You can trade bitcoins for almost anything.

				Your bitcoins never have to go through a bank. And your going to need stealth shipping supplies to get your product to a vendor anyway. This is either a feeble attempt at a le sting or you sir need to invest more time reading these forums....

				So your telling me that Mr vendor purchases 50 Kg+ on SR, has it&nbsp; delivered through the mail, pays SR consumer/high rates and does so in bitcoins, LOL. <br />That&#039;s over £300,000, Do you know what 50 kilos of green looks like?

Every post office/ money outlet etc has it for their own protection! Even if you use a fake details your picture taken when you go in store to cash in and a picture is a pretty good way of identifying you. How is that a benefit? So the charges when I&#039;m arrested read: Category 4, leading role in cannabis distribution and production (That&#039;s the highest charge you can get in UK), fraud (fake ID&#039;s) and money laundering. Plus there will be a handful of petty charges too. LMAO, Thats 15yrs+ (read my previous posts to find out why).<br /><br />If I deal in cash I don&#039;t have to go into an outlet to cash my coins, dont have to set myself up for fraud and money laundering charges. <br />Seriously, there&#039;s a hell of a difference between a 1 year/community order and 8-15years hard time.<br />Anybody who doesn&#039;t consider that is a fool.<br /><br />
