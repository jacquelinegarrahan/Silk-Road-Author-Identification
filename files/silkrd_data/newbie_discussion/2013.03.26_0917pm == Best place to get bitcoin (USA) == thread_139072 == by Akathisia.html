				I wouldn&#039;t recommend using a seller on SR, they&#039;re way too expensive. Just do a deposit on bitfloor, it&#039;s really easy, practically no fee (like 0.5%) and anonymous. Check out the security section or do a search cuz getting bitcoins through bitfloor has been explained a lot of times already :)

				Sugarmama works great for me, when my usual guy isn&#039;t around. Sometimes you can get lucky and find someone with no fee.

				I really recommend bitfloor over bitinstant. It has some drawbacks but it&#039;s way cheaper overall, and doesn&#039;t ask for any personal information. It only works at bank of america though which is what&#039;s annoying but there&#039;s a way smaller fee, and there&#039;s no $10 moneygram fee either. You even get a better exchange with their limit order option so it&#039;s really a win everywhere. You basically just need to create an account on an anonymous computer, select cash deposit option, print the invoice and ask for an out-of-state deposit slip (unless you live in new york) at a bank of America, fill in the info (no personal info) and the funds will go to your bitfloor account, then you do the exchange on bitfloor.com and withdraw to your wallet.<br /><br />Nice guide cutehotgirl though, to each their own I guess, I prefer bitfloor. +1 to you.

				I did CVS and Bitinstant, it was extremely easy and anonymous is you&#039;re paranoid.<br /><br />I don&#039;t buy large quantities or move lots of BTC around, so I just use Dwolla &gt; Mtgox &gt; wallet &gt; SR. I am a realist, moving around a few $100 in drugs isn&#039;t going to attract enough attention from the law to really dig into my BTC finance path to worry about complete anonymity.
