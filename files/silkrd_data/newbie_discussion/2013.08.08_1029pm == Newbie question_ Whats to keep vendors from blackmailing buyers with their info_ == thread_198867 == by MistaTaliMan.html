				Ok so I&#039;ve mustered up the courage to make my first purchase on the road this weekend!! woohoo!<br /><br />I DO have a question that has been buggin me for a while.. and I lurk the forums so I do know the basics.<br /><br />A buyer sends his/her address/drop address to a vendor. What on EARTH is there to prevent a vendor from turning into a blackmailer? The temptation must be there? And please don&#039;t say &quot;they will get their vendorship revoked&quot;.<br /><br />For example , if Vendor John starts messaging all his customers as soon as they order (PGP encrypted or privnoted or whatever) : &quot; I have your address and name. Doesnt matter if it&#039;s real or a drop. If you do not finalize right now/send me X amount of BTC to Y address within an hour, I will give your information to the authorities. If you report me, the worst that will happen is I will get banned, but I STILL have your information and then it will get even nastier. So, hand over your money, and if you think about reporting me to SR I will ruin your life/kill you/skullfuck you etc etc&quot;<br /><br />What protection do buyers have against that? Whats to stop a vendor from falling into that temptation? I&#039;m thinking this kind of shit must be happening from time to time and the vendors are getting away with it because the buyers would naturally (I WOULD BE TOO) scared shitless to call the vendor bluff.<br /><br />Are we safeguarded against this? and YES I know that someone will eventually report them and they will be banned and lose their vendor bond, but fuck man, they would have blackmailed so much hard earned money that the vendor bond would have been a small investment.<br /><br />Are we safe from this? Does this happen? Any way to minimize the chances of this happening to me ever?<br /><br />(Sorry for the super duper paranoia.. its just that its my first time purchasing... so more then the mailman discovering drugs in my mail I get scared about a stranger drug dealer on the internet having my information and potentially turning into an extortionist at some point).<br /><br />any advice folks?

				Bad for business.&nbsp; Drug dealers come here to make money. The more good quality feedback they get, the more people will want to buy from them. If they are &quot;skull fucking&quot; their customers, they probably won&#039;t get too many once the word leaks out. (And it would, even if there was attempted extortion.) Plus, dealers have a lot more to lose than the people they sell to. They aren&#039;t about to risk everything to snitch on someone they don&#039;t even know. But if you are still worried, check their feedback, if they have made hundreds of transactions and everyone seems happy, you have no reason to be afraid. :)

				Obviously I would only order from reputed vendors. But what if the vendors business IS exotortion and the drug vending is just an afterthought (or even a total cover)? To absorb as much customer data as they can and then just demand money? A buyers name/address is literally like putting their LIFE into someones hands.. is it not? If some reputed vendor (or even a mediocre vendor) collected buyer information (as we see with the Bluegiraffe episode does happen), and one night woke up and thought &quot;thats it, fuck this, Im out of the dealing business. today i become a piece of shit blackmailer&quot; and then starts blackmailing his customers? <br /><br />i am no coward, but jeezus.. i dunno what i would do if i clicked Order and sent my info to a vendor only to receive a demand for money otherwise dire consequences of being doxed/reported/physically threatened.<br /><br />it sure takes a strong stomach to be a buyer around here.. :o

				Sellers are supposed to destroy their copy of your address as soon as they ship your package. But even if they don&#039;t, they still couldn&#039;t extort you because that&#039;s all they have. Anyone with access to a phone book can find a public address, it proves nothing. And if they had proof that you bought drugs from them they aren&#039;t about to turn it over to the police because they would be facing even heavier time. Trust me it&#039;s just paranoia, I buy here all the time. You&#039;re safe. :)

				I really doubt the police would take that sort of random, anonymous tip seriously. Anybody can say &quot;(Person&#039;s name) is involved in drugs!&quot; about someone they don&#039;t like, but they still don&#039;t have shit for actual evidence against you to substantiate their claim.

				For one thing cops harldly care about buyers or recreational drug users, ya if they pull you over and your hotboxing your car there gonna search, but they hardly investigate even low level drug dealers, let alone buyers, the drug division around here only fucks with meth dealers that fuck with ozs-lbs, the only time others get busted is from controlled buys, they never investigate users period unless they think there close with the source and think they will roll on the source. Plus most weasles I know dont ever have the $500 to even start a vendor account, if they happened to get $500 from theft, it would be spent on meth and fiending by the next day before ever doing something like trying to invest that money. Theres asshole fiends in my area that threaten ppl to call the cops on them and say they do drugs around there kids etc if they wont give them what they want, but the cops dont take it serious, they know its revenge calls, cause there so common, stupid tips like that are small fish in a huge load of information cops have on high level dealers/ things way more important to do with there time. I cant imagine it crossing a vendors mind even, at least in my case, just some thoughts to hopefully comfort your worries~
