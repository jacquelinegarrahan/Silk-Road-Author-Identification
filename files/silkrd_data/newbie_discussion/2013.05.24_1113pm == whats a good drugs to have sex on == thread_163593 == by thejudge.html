				Roxies...Not sure what they really are always came in a blue speckled pill.&nbsp; Might have been roxicodine.&nbsp; If is very euphoric, very good sex, no limpdick.&nbsp; Highly addictive.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard sex on H is good to but I&#039;ve never done it.

				Methadone is my favorite. Everything feels awesome, your endurance is increased dramatically, and no limp dick problems (at least in my experience). You&#039;ll feel like a porn star.

				I hate fucking on chemicals. It makes it too hard for me to blow.<br /><br />Weed is OK. I used to always be drunk and it is so much better sober.

				Unfortunately the SO isn&#039;t into drugs, so I don&#039;t get to know firsthand what it&#039;s like. But I had a friend who had sex on nitrous, and while the mental image of them trying to have sex with balloons in their mouths is hilarious, apparently it was pretty fun.<br /><br />I could just see myself getting distracted if I had sex on LSD.

				I think 2ci is my favorite drug to have sex on.&nbsp; 2ci gives you the body high of ecstasy and the trippiness of an LSD trip and the best part of 2ci is that you can climax on it.&nbsp; MDMA makes it pretty difficult, but 2ci is just, just great.&nbsp; <br /><br />Additionally, if you&#039;re going to have sex on a psychedelic, I recommend taking a shower with this person in complete darkness.&nbsp; Turn off the lights inside the bathroom, outside the bathroom, and block out all the light you can so that when you&#039;re in there, you can&#039;t see anything!!&nbsp; Once that happens, your eyes are wide open and your mind is as well, and your mind creates the coolest visual hallucinations when you deprive it of actual visual stimulation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just try it, and tell me I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)

				Last night the wife and I each took a 150MG MDMA/Amphetamine Tri-Force pill (SuperTrips product) and they were very, very good to say the least. Fucked my wife up pretty good which made me pretty much laugh watching her....was actually hilarious! But more importantly, it made for some incredibly amazing sex! Great fucking experience for sure! The wife is already asking if we&#039;re taking more today. LOL! Damn horny bitch!

				A little meth and oxycodone (crushed up roxi mixed with powdered crystal and both parachuted or mix in with a shot of Tequila or whatever). Makes you extra lovy-dovy, gives you energy and stamina, and a kick ass, face contorting orgasm. <br /><br />Downside? Makes you sweat. Might not be a *bad* thing if you know what I mean. Especially if your girl takes it. Makes her super wet and her labia extra sensitive.<br /><br />You heard it hear first.&nbsp;
