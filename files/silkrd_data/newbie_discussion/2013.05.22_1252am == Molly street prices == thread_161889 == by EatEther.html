				It depends on your street.&nbsp; In my neighborhood that&#039;s ludicrously cheap, but in other places around the world it&#039;s not too far off.

				Sounds cheap to me too. I suggest buying a smaller amount and using some of the money you saved for testing.

				i had a feeling that it might have been BK-MDMA but i will try and sample it for quality. the thing is i have no idea how this is done.<br />@ awesome1126 i was asking around the streets because it seems like domestic is too expensive for resale locally and internationally takes too long and is too risky<br />

				400 is great price.&nbsp; or a scam.&nbsp; 600 is good price.&nbsp; In my area of US price is 600-800, but if buying in bulk, can get down to around 500.<br />Also in my area it comes around cheaper when its stolen and they just want to get rid of it fast.&nbsp; But the prices I gave above are the average going rates.

				That&#039;d be $14 a gram.&nbsp; Good molly goes for upwards of $100 a gram here, so that&#039;d be such a good deal I&#039;d think it&#039;s a scam here.&nbsp; Different places, different prices I guess.&nbsp; Most molly on the road is closer to $30-50 a gram.

				If the world was a casino and I could bet on anything, I&#039;d bet almost everything I had that a $400oz would not be real MDMA when purchased alone or not from a REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

				$30-$50 is expensive for molly? I find it hard to believe that.<br /><br />Here in the UK the street price is about Â£30 (roughly $50) and that&#039;s considered a very good price

				I&#039;m really questioning the UK market. I know a few recreational MDMA users across the pond, but they don&#039;t deal. They&#039;ve told me prices like the equivalent of $50 for a gram, and they swore up and down that it was real molly, but they didn&#039;t test with reagent kits and I don&#039;t trust subjective experience.
