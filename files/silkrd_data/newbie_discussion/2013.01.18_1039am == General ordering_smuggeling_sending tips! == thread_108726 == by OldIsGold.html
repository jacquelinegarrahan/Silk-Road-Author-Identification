				Hey all,<br />After my story about Leonard Pickard in another thread, I decided to offer some basic advice to newbies.<br />Let&#039;s make these 50 posts count!<br /><br />1. Police are trained to lie, deceive people, while tricking your mind into believing they&#039;re being honest. Take for example their hats that don&#039;t allow you to view their eyebrows, or all the bulky &quot;reflective/shiny&quot; crap they wear on their uniform.<br />-------Never trust a cop who claims to &quot;help you&quot;, &quot;make it easy for you&quot;, or &quot;make your length in jail longer if you don&#039;t cooperate&quot;------

				2.&nbsp; There is no such thing as a &quot;odor proof&quot; container because EVERY ORGANIC SUBSTANCE LEAVES AN ODOR TRAIL made of microscopic organic particles which will leak through any wall.<br /><br /><br /><br />(PS: This wasn&#039;t written by myself, but copied a long time ago from the OVDB forum if I&#039;m not mistaking.)

				3. A method used to beat this flaw is to simply use airtight bags, wash the outside of the bag with alcohol, and than spray the bag with fox urine. Fox-urine disarms drug sniffing dogs by making them believe there is a natural predator in the area they need to protect themselves from and all drug related business can wait.

				4. Never sell, buy, order, or arrange drug orders from inside your house. No law enforcement agency can raid your house if they don&#039;t have enough proof that they&#039;ll find physical evidence to build a case against you.

				5. Police can not enter your home, no matter how much pot they claim to have seen smelled. Common sense says if they had a warrant to enter your home, last thing they&#039;ll do is give you a warning by knocking on the door LMAO :)

				9. If you are ever pulled over, EAT YOUR STASH!!!!!. If the narcotic detectives can&#039;t find any physical evidence to use against you in court, they don&#039;t have a case against you and no judge will even consider proceeding with a case without physical evidence. (PERSONAL NOTE: only do this if it&#039;s safe, it&#039;s not worth overdosing)<br /><br />Last 2 are maybe the newest and most relevant to the SR members_________________________________________________________<br />10. Police can now legally dig through your garbage if it&#039;s outside your home or inside an unlocked garage or unlocked fence. No joke.<br />11. Always destroy anything that they could dig out of your trash and use to build a case against you or get a warrant to raid your home.<br />

				First thing I&#039;d do is put on the latex gloves.&nbsp; Anywhere I touch and anything I touch that a finger print could be left on.&nbsp; Second, I keep my area clean and organized.&nbsp; I never just have shit laying around with other shit. Third, I seal my shit within hours of it being sent to where its going, it takes time for smell permeation to occur.&nbsp; Fourth, I hide it in plain site, I don&#039;t make shit look like a stealth package.&nbsp; I shouldn&#039;t reveal any more than that.&nbsp; Police generally look for a &#039;stash&#039;. Some secret hideaway they figure someone is using to smuggle shit.&nbsp; Hiding in plain site totally goes around that concept.&nbsp; One of the worst things about dealing is sitting on shit and not getting rid of it, so hiding spots are key.&nbsp; Not that I&#039;m a dealer or anything.&nbsp; Just a rumour I heard.

				not entirely sold on the fox urine thing... surely LE know about those tactics by now and are wise to the,? if they see their dogs go tits up at a package it could indicate someone&#039;s trying to hide something...<br />Though i&#039;m no expert. Just my 2p
