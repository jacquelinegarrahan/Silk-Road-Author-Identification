				everyone makes a big hype about cocaine but for me it really doesnt have that much of an effect, everytime i do it i just feel maybe a little jittery, and maybe a little body high, i had yayo one time from the islands and it was decent, got me pretty good feeling like superman, but everytime i get it now its always a disappointment, i bought a ball last night and did it all day long and all night and finished about 2.5 grams of it, not really feeling anything great it was from the westcoast, i felt a lil numb but it just wasnt that great the guy that brought it to me said its called bombay? but my buddies do it and they really like it, i just cant figure out why i dont feel much? its the same with energy drinks, doesnt effect me. could this be from me naturally always having energy? i wish i had as much fun on it as everyone else, then it would be worth paying for it

				I don&#039;t really prefer coke.&nbsp; Adderall gives me more energy and last way longer making it much more useful for me.&nbsp; Cocaine is fun, but it&#039;s nothing like what I imagined it&#039;d be.

				Coke is awful. Why would you spend all that money on a shitty greedy buzz when you could spend a fraction of it on a decent 220mg pill and have way more fun&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Coke makes people greedy, needy and nasty. MDMA makes people hug each other and dance. ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />

				I agree that mdma is a much more mellow, social, and enjoyable high.&nbsp; Unfortunately, mdma gives me nasty, nasty migraines so I have to use cocaine instead.&nbsp; <br /><br />Coke high is pretty enjoyable if it is quality stuff and you are drinking on it.&nbsp; Unfortunately good coke is difficult to score.

				Coke is for rich white businessmen who have so much money that they dont know what to do with it. I know people who use coke primarily because it&#039;s a status symbol, with the stimulant effects as a bonus.

				I see what is your point. <br /><br />I will try and say my opinion about this drug. Yes it does affect you (ofc) but I really don&#039;t love this feeling that coke gets you. Maybe you are more energetic and have a bit a high confidence but I think that as a drug is not worth it. The price is to much for something you already have inside you and most of all it is addictive.<br /><br />I can understand why people really likes doing cocaine but I am more of a psychedelics guy.. If I had some money to spend in drugs I would prefer to spend them in lsd, mushrooms and weed instead for 1-2 grams of cocaine. I don&#039;t search for it, although I won&#039;t say no to someone who offers,<br /><br />That&#039;s my thesis about the drug.<br /><br />Take care people!

				&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been a huge fan of coke.&nbsp; I like it every now and then, and I can see why people like it so much, but my drug of choice has and will always be opiates.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d use it if people I trust offered some to me, but I would not spend my own money on coke. I like adderall so much better and it lasts longer. coke is only fun because it is illegal and it just &#039;feels wrong&#039; to do it, which is exciting.

				Yes.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t last long.&nbsp; It feels good though.&nbsp; MDPV gives you the same feeling but last a like 16 hours and&nbsp; the dosage is wayyyy less and it&#039;s much cheaper.&nbsp; There are other RCs that feel better.&nbsp; My RCs are also not cut with poison.&nbsp; They are of the highest purity.&nbsp; So yes, coke sucks.&nbsp; It&#039;s great for being a dickhead snob though.&nbsp; Like the people who show up at a house or something and do some lines in front of everyone and leave.&nbsp; Yeah, you&#039;re real cool. ::)

				If you read the cocaine thread then it seems normal to waste lots of money on coke.&nbsp; I try and stay out of that thread.<br /><br />I do like to have some coke on hand for when I&#039;m rolling/tripping hard and can&#039;t seem myself from dozing.&nbsp; I&#039;ll mix it with mephedrone.&nbsp; I have Adderall but maybe should try getting straight speed.
