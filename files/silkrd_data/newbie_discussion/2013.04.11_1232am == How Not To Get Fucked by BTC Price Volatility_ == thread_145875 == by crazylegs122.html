				I feel like its a smart idea to dollar-cost average your bitcoin purchases with what ever is your source of income. Set aside a certain % or dollar amount every paycheck and only buy that amount of bitcoins. Don&#039;t just buy when you need to get stuff off SR. Side benefit is you will also control how much you are using SR. If the price skyrockets and you don&#039;t use all the BTC from your last purchase, you might have &quot;free&quot; drugs next time you need to re-up. If it drops, well that sucks but once you purchase your next scheduled set of BTC, you&#039;ll have a bunch of extra BTC that will go up in value the next time the price swings up. Thoughts?

				Sounds like a good idea to me :) of course a lot of it is luck, especially with the kind of ups and downs we&#039;ve seen this week; but that&#039;s a good a plan as any to secure dem coins.

Turns out somebody was playing with the market. Sorry but people are investing money, and just lost a boat load.<br />I was lucky, sold my initial investment, at $250 by chance, but bought at $140, sold at $170, bought at $140 again, crash. <br />At one point I was up 20k. 10x my investment. Now I&#039;m about 2-3 times my investment, with my original amount buying product at $190.<br />There is nothing you could invest that could make that amount now a days.<br /><br />Basically if I buy coins, and the market goes up. I buy again to make my purchase, and hold the older stuff.<br />When the market looks like it&#039;s falling, I hedge my purchases.<br /><br />Also I know there is/are bot on the exchanges trying to hold the price stable. I know because I play with the bot late at night. I make it move a penny this way or that way.<br /><br />People make money on currency exchanges all the time. The problem is if you don&#039;t watch constantly you can lose you shirt. IE what happened last week.<br />It appears we were sent down the garden path to be eaten. Moral, don&#039;t invest, or buy what you can&#039;t afford to lose. This whole thing is a house of scams. Be very careful. I&#039;m sure greed bit a lot of people. I should have known when the main stream started reporting on it;)<br /><br />I&#039;d much prefer just to use BTC, but if you that, you will be on the losing side every time. I got sick of losing 5-10% every rotation.<br />Now I follow the market. BTW some of the charts are BS as they only show the average. There money to be made buying low, selling high.

				SR USES THE MT GOX WEIGHTED AVERAGE, YOU CAN ESTIMATE WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE JUST BY LOOKING AT VARIOUS BITCOIN PRICE DATA<br /><br />AS LONG AS YOU MAKE YOUR BTC PURCHASE QUICKLY AND THEN BUY ON SR THERE SHOULD BE VERY LITTLE VARIANCE IN EXCHANGE RATE<br /><br />
