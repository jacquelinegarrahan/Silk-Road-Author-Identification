				Hey guys, first off...yes im aware there are topics about this already. However I already searched and couldn&#039;t find anything useful. <br />Im flying domestic U.S and im thinking of bringing small amount of molly..like 3g.&nbsp; Anyone have any experience with this can offer some advice on where to hide it. Obviously il put it in the stow away luggage..not carry on. I was thinking ziplock bag hidden in a shampoo bottle. <br /><br />Suggestions? Or is this a really dumb idea...i feel like security for luggage is really lax...but please correct me if im wrong. Not lookin to do jail time for something stupid.

				I&#039;ve been personal friends with a TSA inspector for a while now, and from what he&#039;s told me, it&#039;s probably best that you mail it instead of flying with it.

				is it possible to measure out your doses into caps before you leave? then mix these in with some type of vitamin that is of a similar size cap/color.&nbsp; for example, buy calicum in caps, dump out some of the caps &amp; refill with your powder. or buy caps of same size. I usually cap my own &amp; mix with 5-htp caps. you will tell them apart because your caps probably won&#039;t be full. and in my experience they are not going to dump out your pill bottles and inspect each pill...even in a carry on. honestly I feel more comfortable in a carry on because you never know how thoroughly they will inspect your checked bag if it gets pulled.&nbsp; mixed in with a vitamin that already is a powder in a capsule is way less suspicious than any random baggie of powder/rocks.

				Ok so first of all, taking any amount of drugs on an airplane is risky. <br /><br />Now that that&#039;s over with...<br /><br />A few things:<br /><br />1) The TSA&#039;s job is to look for weapons/bombs.&nbsp; They&#039;ve said outright before that it&#039;s not their job to find drugs, but if they do, they will take it seriously.<br /><br />2) Most of the dogs you&#039;ll see in an airport are bomb-sniffing dogs, but there may be some drug dogs.&nbsp; You just never know.<br /><br />3) How much do you know about your departure airport?&nbsp; If you know that they only use metal detectors, and not the backscatter machines, it is probably safer to keep it on your person, and make ABSOLUTELY sure that there is nothing on you that will set off the metal detector and lead to an &quot;enhanced&quot; pat-down.&nbsp; If you make it through the metal detector, 99% of the time you are home free, but you may get selected for a more intensive search.&nbsp; Make sure it is REALLY well hidden just in case this happens.<br /><br />4) That said, I once got to my destination, opened my bag, and found a bag of molly in plain sight, that must have been in that bag from another time.&nbsp; I made it through the x-ray machine in my carry-on, and it was even in a suspicious-looking drug bag.&nbsp; I got really, really lucky.<br /><br />5) You could always plug it and then go to the bathroom and retrieve before you get on the plane...

				Back before they xrayed you, it was easier.&nbsp; Now, I dunno.&nbsp; I think it would be insane to have it on your person these days.&nbsp; Hell they will pat you down if your socks look funny.&nbsp; &quot;Do you have something in your left pocket?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Errr...&quot;<br /><br />Aidoneous&#039;s molly capsules look kinda like benadryl, or clindamycin.&nbsp; Generics, these days, who knows.&nbsp; If you have an old rx bottle for just about anything, you could probably get away with carrying just these in there.&nbsp; I mean, its better than some ridiculous cartoon pill, or a little bag of powder.&nbsp; At that point, all you have to worry about is dogs, and... really?&nbsp; MDMA dogs at the airport?<br /><br />That said, toting MDMA in the luggage makes me nervous.&nbsp; Had a friend busted for having cocaine in his carryon years ago, kinda makes me nervous.&nbsp; I&#039;ll fly with acid any day.&nbsp; (Maybe not ON acid... I tried that once.&nbsp; Which was enough.)&nbsp; But MDMA?&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; It&#039;s a risk/beneft, like with everything else, I guess.&nbsp; Risk of flying with it vs risk of trying to buy it on street when you get there.&nbsp;

				A few months ago, I had a really early morning flight out of town.&nbsp; Before I left the house I did a few lines of coke.&nbsp; When I got to the airport and went thru the security machine (not an x-ray, the newer type that looks like a space pod.)&nbsp; They flagged me for further screening, which consisted of them wiping my hands with little swabs and putting them in another machine, which they said looked for explosive residue.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m not saying the coke was what set off the first machine, but I sure as fuck hadn&#039;t been handling any explosives.&nbsp; Weird.<br />

				If it&#039;s jut a couple gs, then I don&#039;t see why you don&#039;t put it in something super tiny and put in it your old jeans in a travel kleenex bag or something in your checked in luggage.<br />I forgot a bag of coca leaves on my way back from Peru and no one said anything about it in the American airport. I feel like it&#039;s wait easier to bring in small amount of stuff (a couple Gs are nothing) than we think it is.

				Skimming through topics i came across this and thought, oh, experiences on drugs on a plane? This might be interesting!<br /><br />Nevertheless interesting thread. Always debating rolling on a flight but...do you really want to be in a situation where you HAVE to sit down? I mean sure sitting is nice, when you WANT to. Being forced to do anything on any serious drug is just...not sure the word I&#039;m looking for. A major downer to the experience.

				Just three grams of molly? <br /><br />Treble-bag it, lube it up, and up your backside. Slip it out at the start of the flight and reinsert just before landing.<br /><br />Otherwise you&#039;re going to be terrified the entire flight.
