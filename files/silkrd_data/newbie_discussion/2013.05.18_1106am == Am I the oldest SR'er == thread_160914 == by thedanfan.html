				he he cheers to that Thedanfan <br />I myself have past 40 and even that feels old sometimes - especially in the forums.<br /><br />Actually sometimes I feel like a split personality - I have two daughters in their early teens and am trying to<br />be the responsible father and teach them to be careful (I have skipped &quot;avoid&quot; that would taste too bad in my mouth)<br />and not end up in some drug problem.<br />Hilariously enough I am ordering C on SR pretty often and I must say after finding SR and rediscover good quality C like I used to get in the streets<br />in the late 80&#039;s - I do enjoy my high and my anonymity.<br />Even more I enjoy when the mailman arrives :-) my new best friend.<br /><br />Funny story - some months ago I was getting back from a meeting and the police had stopped a car up the hill where I live - 6 officers tearing a Porsche Cayenne apart obviously <br />looking for drugs and my mailman passed in the same moment and delivered 20 minutes later a nice delivery with C - muhahahaha<br /><br />SR really cracks me up sometimes.<br />

				You got the drop on me by 7 years, thedanfan, so I feel quite sprightly now! I got involved with SR because my new girl who is quite a bit younger than me wanted to try acid. I don&#039;t know ANYONE who sells ANYTHING these days. But some careful research and a steep learning curve and SR had what I wanted it and it blew her mind.<br /><br />Saw a great T shirt the other day, the print was a photo from an American festival, late 60&#039;s/early 70&#039;s, some folks at a festival with a hand-made sign advertising acid at $1 a tab! Wonder if you remember anything similar from your youth? (don&#039;t know where you live of course!)<br /><br />Keep rocking the Road, I know I will!<br /><br />Take care.

				When I was younger and in college pot was so plentiful you could find it everywhere.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m in my late 40&#039;s and its a different story.&nbsp; All the people I meet are very &quot;square&quot;.&nbsp; They&#039;re ok people, but scoring is near impossible.<br /><br />I remember when acid was roughly $7 a tab.&nbsp; It would sometimes be $10 but no one would pay that unless they were sure it was really really good.&nbsp; $5 was common too.&nbsp; If you were at a Dead show it was practically free.&nbsp;

				What is good about SR is that is does not discriminate who can use it or not. Anyone from anywhere in the world, no matter what age a person is or lifestyle decisions that person made. This place is one of the few safe havens this world has. You can get coke that takes you back to the 80&#039;s or just discover coke like this for the first time. What a magical place.

				Heh, so, me too, I&#039;m now nearer 50 than 40 years old... I supposed there were more people around this age here but didnt think we&#039;d be so many :)<br /><br />I agree with many things some of you said, for me it&#039;s also great the idea of being able to get my hands on any kind of stuff, but with a time delay, to help with possible abuse... Also the waiting for the mail makes me feel like&nbsp; a kid again waiting for some toy I had ordered, it&#039;s all very emotional, clear, and oh so convenient!

				I am within a couple years of 50, I have been surprised by the number of &quot;older&quot; folks replying to this thread. I think the overall demographic of SR is the younger gen. I remember going in on sheets of Orange Sunshine LSD for about $150-175 in the early eighties. They were around 125-150 uG per blotter. The 2000&#039;s has been such a dry period for me, I have had to grow my own shrooms and Poppies and extract my own DMT crystals. Now I just have to get BTCs!!!
