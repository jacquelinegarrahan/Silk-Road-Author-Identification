				In reply to the thread title:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />What you don&#039;t understand is that the newbie section isn&#039;t for only for spamming.&nbsp; It allows you to post your questions, your reviews, and anything else you want, while not cluttering the other sections with junk that often gets posted.

				I have been on here for 4 months. I have questions that I do not trust will be answered correctly by newbies. There is very little experience here compared to the wealth of experience on the regular forum. Don&#039;t try to sugar coat it, this fucking sucks. I had just completed my first pgp transaction. I will just keep posting stupid shit until I can get back to the real forum.
