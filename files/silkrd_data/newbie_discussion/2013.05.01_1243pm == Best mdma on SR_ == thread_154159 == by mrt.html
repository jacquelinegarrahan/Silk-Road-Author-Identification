				<br />Im not sure who has the best MDMA on SR. But if you wanted some Pills Containing nothing but the highest Grade MDMA then I suggest buying some Nintendo&#039;s off the Heinken. Although his pills are not the highest dosed (Still Pretty high dose) they are certainly the highest quality MDMA used within them. All and all banging pills!<br /><br />Clockwork

				I&#039;m sorry but there is only one answer to this question dude. His name is Cloudsurfer and his MDMA is the undisputed king on Silk Road. While having the dopest MDMA, hes also very professional, and his stealth is borderline master ninja like =). Go with this guy and you won&#039;t be disappointed I can promise you that.

				Without getting extremely technical...<br /><br />MDMA, when encountered in the wild, is found as a salt - MDMA.HCl. When the salt crystals form under perfect chemistry, the resulting product is 84% MDMA and 16% Hydrochloride (Hydrogen Chloride).<br /><br />So 100% &#039;pure&#039; MDMA found in the wild is actually only 84% pure (MDMA).<br />Assuming 84=100, then product that is 86% pure MDMA is really only 72.24% MDMA, at least 16% HCl, and 11.76% nonsense/fuck up. LOL<br /><br />Course... if you happen to encounter MDMA in freebase form, you can find truly 100% pure product (or as close as possible eliminating trace elements like dust). But this is a liquid... kind of.<br />.Whish.

				You can take a look at the MDMA Avengers Review Thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129424.0<br /><br />A group of Silkroaders is performing acetone washes to test the purity of MDMA. However, acetone washes are not selective enough to test for MDMA only. But the thread has links to other threads with vendor reviews.

				I have had good experiences with MDMA from MrAnonymousX (UK vendor) whose gear has been clean and potent. Had 150mg this weekend and was off my tits&nbsp; :) but had a nice gentle comedown.&nbsp; Sadly he hasnt got any listings at the moment but usually gets stock pretty quick.<br /><br />Also recomended is K Queen who sent a lovely delivery recently, only tried a little so far but passed the inital &quot;50mg line&quot; test with flying colours, still waiting to get properly fucked on this tho...

				It depends where you are, but there are some names which are synonymous with quality, i.e Ivory, Symbiosis, cloudsurfer<br />With small amounts, shipments should come from any half decent vendor, regardless of borders.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re just using for occasional personal use, I&#039;d recommend doing an acetone wash. There&#039;s a really good guide on the forums:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45508<br /><br />you can recrystallise it too, if you&#039;re a purity freak like me.<br />I never feel shitty the day after rolls now, as I make sure sleep and eat well.<br /><br />What really annoys me is that even the most basic purification is not common for clandestine labs, as it&#039;s extra work, and the cleaner MDMA is harder to &quot;rock&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about getting a large amount of MDMA from NL, and reselling on SR after cleaning it.
