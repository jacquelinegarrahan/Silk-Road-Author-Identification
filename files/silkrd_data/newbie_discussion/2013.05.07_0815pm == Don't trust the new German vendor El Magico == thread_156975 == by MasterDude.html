				when this guy started out he asked to f.e.... when he was told that he can&#039;t do that he had to rethink his plan... <br />and he is pretty much canceling any order over 10g, so if you order more he will cancel anything exept the smallest item and offer you that item... he actually said to me that he doesn&#039;t have any coke, that was while the listing is up... he doesn&#039;t have more than 10 g of weed per order, he will just cancel any order, i wanted to buy about 40g for a good price... he cancelled it and fucked my bitcoins... he then offered me 10 g... when i asked why he has done that he says he doesn&#039; have the large listings or coke and is just letting through small orders to reach 35 to be able to asked for F.E.... i dont know why he would tell me this, but this guy is just an asshole with 10 gramms and 0,1 coke and some speed to get some orders while he has bigger listings he just cancels... <br /><br />somebody from the staff needs to do something... this guy just doesn&#039;t give a fuck...
