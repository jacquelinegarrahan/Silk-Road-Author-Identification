				Pretty sure GHB doesn&#039;t<br />Psychedelics<br />and Ketamine isn&#039;t tested for but can show up as a false positive for PCP.<br /><br />Don&#039;t resort to MDPV because you can&#039;t do other drugs. Start drinking more if you feel the need to be fucked up all the time, but don&#039;t get addicted to MDPV.

				GHB would be my inebriant of choice if I had drug tests to worry about. Synthetic &#039;noids are ok, but if I&#039;m not mistaken some of them they can test for (particularly JWH) Also, they aren&#039;t to be taken lightly, know that they have the ability to rip you a new asshole if you overdo them.

				It can be a problem if your PO shows up while you&#039;re high.&nbsp; Also, if you&#039;re subject to warrentless searches then you better have good hiding spots.

				Personally, I had a friend who got a random drug test 3 times a week. Tested for almost everything, and he&#039;s actually the reason I started using SR, to supply him with hallucinogens. <br /><br />I&#039;ve given him plenty of 25i (from enboom) and it&#039;s never shown up, and he&#039;s tripped with plenty of boomers with no consequence. If GHB doesn&#039;t show up, I&#039;d love to get my hands on that.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard that methylone doesn&#039;t show up, but I think that&#039;s hardly worth it. Not a big fan.<br />
