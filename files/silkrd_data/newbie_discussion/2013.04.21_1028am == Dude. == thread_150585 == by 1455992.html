				Bitcoin is not that fucking hard to get. If you honestly cant figure out how to secure bitcoin, you don&#039;t need to be using SR, and if you cant link a bank account, or go to a money gram, you are in no situation to get drugs mailed to your mommy or daddys house. <br />/end rant

				And yes that seems a little harsh, but you can find ALL the info on clearnet through google, and with a LITTLE EFFORT find it yourself. It just bothers me how people don&#039;t want to do any work. Bitinstant literally walks you through step by step, and even tells you WHERE TO GO inside of the store to pay, who to talk to, what to say, and ALL you do is type in your bitcoin address on the first page.

				link a bank account?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; That sounds like a horrible idea.&nbsp; Like so many other bad ideas and tidbits of shitty information that litter the info pool which newbs have to sort through to learn all this stuff...&nbsp; Throw &#039;em a bone, and for the real retards...just try not to let them bother you, I don&#039;t think the pandemic is going away anytime soon ;)

				Bad idea? A common misconception is that BITCOINS ARE NOT ILLEGAL. Giving them to people is not illegal. Receiving illicit substances in the mail is illegal. Nothing in the process of getting bitcoins is against the law, and it is anonymous even if you link a bank account, as SR tumbles all bitcoins it touches. The info that litters the pool come from everyone going APESHIT about anonymity when it really doesn&#039;t matter with certain things. they make the process SO much more complicated with tumblers and extra wallets, and extra destinations.

				I didn&#039;t know about the tumbling in sr...but still, I&#039;d rather be safe and just stay in the habit of diligent precaution.<br />Of course btcs aren&#039;t illegal, but it doesn&#039;t mean I want to use an address traceable back to my bank account to buy illegal shit.&nbsp; Not all bitcoins are spent through sr and they are not anonymous by nature.&nbsp; Every transaction is in the blockchain.&nbsp; I think people tune their diligence according to how much they feel they need to hide their activities from their governments.&nbsp; Where I live this distrust is growing.&nbsp; People are waking up to the fact that money has simply become a tool for wealth concentration and enslavement through debt.&nbsp; Only hidden and anonymous btcs are safe from legislated theft.<br />To each their own though right?&nbsp; And who knows, maybe you&#039;re right.&nbsp; I certainly hope your experiences serve you well.
