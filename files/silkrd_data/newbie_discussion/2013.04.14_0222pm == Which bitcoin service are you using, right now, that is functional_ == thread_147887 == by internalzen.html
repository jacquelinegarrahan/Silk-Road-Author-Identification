				Lots and lots of reviews and comments on so many sites, but who are you using right now that works? Lets take bitinstant as an example, I heard they were the best to use for anon, cash based purchasing. But then it seemed everyone was complaining they were not getting there coins in a timely manner. <br /><br />I&#039;m still waiting for a p2p trans with bitfloor, but was probably going to try a local buy with localbitcoins. Who are you happy with right now?

				I&#039;ve been in the same boat, not knowing who to buy from. You see all these sites that want you to wire money from a bank.. but I work 1st shift out of town and unable to get to my bank before they close. BitInstant has been getting A LOT of bad reviews.. so i chose local bitcoin trader. Found a guy, charging $15 more than MtGox, and bought 1.5 coins from him. They were going for $91 at the moment, so i felt comfortable. Try finding someone local, it&#039;s the quickest way in my eyes.

				Interesting and informative responses. I do like the buy local option, I was thinking of doing that also via localbitcoins. So, how did you like that? How to you do the actual transfer? I think I may do it this week. I&#039;m waiting for bitfloor p2p to complete, it says 3 - 4 business days and its only been 2.

				I have successfully used Bitinstant for over 40 transactions. For a time, transfers made from Dwolla got bogged-down, but the customer service from Bitinstant always resolved the problem quickly and professionally.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve used their Moneygram service to transfer cash from my pocket to my SR wallet in under an hour.<br /><br />JeanRob

				From my experience, when ordering you are asked for your name, phone number, and email. Then, you print-out you order info., take it to wal-mart, cvs, or wherever, and you fill-out a blue moneygram form (at least this is the process for wal-mart -- which I have used) using the same info that used when making the order.<br /><br />I think that the main thing is that the info you give when you make the order match the info you put on the moneygram form.&nbsp; I see no reason you cannot use fake info. The email is only needed to confirm the order info you printed-out. <br /><br />As I recall, the limit for one transaction (at least at wal-mart) is $500. I found the process smooth and easy. No one at wal-mart seemed to give a shit (like all of their customer service).<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />JeanRob

Bitinstant to Moneygram via WalMart works best for me. Very easy, and no questions. Using fake info is definitely possible. I&#039;ve never had the transaction take more than half an hour (to show up on the blockchain - confirmation can take longer).<br /><br />Note that some users DID have problems with Bitinstant a few days ago, where a bunch of payments were very delayed in clearing. I didn&#039;t have that issue, ans still feel comfortable with the service.

				Bitfloor worked great for me in the first two times, then the third time I couldn&#039;t get to my money until early the next morning. They did return my email I sent them a couple of hours after not finding money in my account. I did around the $1000 range all 3 times. Went into Bank Of America, gave them a piece of paper that you print out from BitFloor telling the account number the EXACT amount. I just gave the note to the teller and said I wanted to make a cash deposit to my stock market company. A place called Local Till processes and they charge some small amount around 2%, and that&#039;s the last charge you see until you start trading. What pissed me off the last time is that the BTC was going up &#039;gangbusters&#039; that day, I had just decided I&#039;d invest in them (actually more investment) and when i got back I expected to be able to buy at $177. Well, money didn&#039;t show up that day until 6 am the next morning. I bought at $211. <br />Oh and I wasn&#039;t able to get in any action the day everything went down, it must have gone down $150 an hour, and was around $40 (at one point) if I remember correctly. I just watched my money disappear, $200, $180, $160 down the line. I finally gave up trying to sell. That and the fact that this sell off was pure manipulation (large purchases at MtGox followed by large scale DDOS) It&#039;s a hard lesson. There&#039;s not much that&#039;s illegal in this brand new market, (it&#039;s not money, it&#039;s not stocks, etc.) and MtGox clearly doesn&#039;t see it&#039;s interests threatened by piss poor performance. I mean they SAID they were vulnerable to a DDOS attack, and as far as I can tell did absolutely nothing about it. If I&#039;m wrong, I&#039;d like to know. <br />As far as I can tell, the exact same thing could happen tomorrow (except there is no reason now, BTC is already so low, and people are wary of buying)
