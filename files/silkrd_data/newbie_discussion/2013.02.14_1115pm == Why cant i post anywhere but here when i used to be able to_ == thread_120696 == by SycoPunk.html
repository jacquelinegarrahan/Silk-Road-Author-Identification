				The admins implemented a policy where you need to have 50 posts in this subforum before being able to post in the rest of the forums.&nbsp; It was put into place in order to give us a better chance to catch the &quot;virwex&quot; / &quot;mtgix&quot; / &quot;bitcointalks&quot; scammer spammers before they had the opportunity to flood the entire forums.&nbsp; This way, we are usually able to notice them and clean it up before they reach the 50 posts necessary to be able to flood the rest of the forums.

				We wouldn&#039;t have taken away any of your posts unless they endangered someone .... so what probably happened is that a thread you had posted in may have been deleted, thereby removing those posts from your post count.&nbsp;

				Doesn&#039;t that basically sentence almost everyone to have to spam 50, since this isn&#039;t exactly the kind of forum most people use to post about their new puppy? ???<br /><br />No complaining just curious if that was an anticipated side effect.&nbsp; ;D

				That&#039;s true, some people do spam to 50.&nbsp; However, two things:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; some people actually take advantage of this time to ask questions and contribute still to review threads started in the newbie forum, etc.; and<br />2.&nbsp; at least the spam from real users here is not the same kind of spam intended to scam people out of their money.<br /><br />So we traded scammer spam for harmless spam ... still spam, yes, but not the kind that fucks people over.&nbsp; :)

				yeah I understand the reason behind a policy like this.<br /><br />but the policy itself was just a really poor decision.<br />50 is too many.<br /><br />now honest people like me who want to ask question have to sit here for a fucking hour spamming before we can.<br />50 is fucking stupid. it should be 20 at the most.

				Rather than a 50 post limit, why not a time as a member limit? I don&#039;t bother posting unless it&#039;s a review so whilst I&#039;ve been a forum member since last year I&#039;ll probably never get up to 50 posts. Oh well, you&#039;ll all have to live without my thoughts on what batch of smack I&#039;m currently liking this week. :-(&nbsp; &nbsp;;D
