				Sorry to ask a question that&#039;s probably been answered before. New to all this and couldn&#039;t find an answer:<br /><br />Bought product 7 days ago. It should have arrived by now. Seller has no more active items for sale. The countdown to autofinalize is on. If I don&#039;t receive the product in another couple of days, I want to cancel this transaction -- I just have a bad feeling about it.<br /><br />How do I do that? There doesn&#039;t seem to be a link I can go to in order to do that? Help! Thanks!

				My understanding is that if there are problems with your order you would hit resolve to go through their resolution to escrow process. I would only use the resolution process if the order doesn&#039;t show after giving it enough time with the understanding that sometimes there are delays in delivery beyond the vendor&#039;s control. I would be patient. If the vendor has good feedback and is established, you shouldn&#039;t have any problems. But if it doesn&#039;t show after a reasonable amount of time, they do have the resolution process and the resolve link should be active before it auto-finalizes.

				Everything slowcrash said plus start with sending a message to the seller first. One week is hardly long enough to determine much at all.&nbsp; Once the item is marked &quot;shipped&quot; you have 17 days before it auto finalizes, during that time you should be trying to message the seller and attempting to resolve things between yourselves before escalating it to the moderators through the dispute process.<br />Seems like you are just impatient and a lack of communication between yourself and the seller should not warrant forum posts such as this.<br /><br />

				Hi inlikeflynn,<br /><br />Vendors have 4 days to process an order and put it &#039;in transit&#039;. You can not cancel the order until this 4 day period is up, and you can not cancel it once it is put &#039;in transit&#039;.<br /><br />If your order has not arrived after 10 days, put it into resolution.<br /><br />Please see the SR Wiki here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#My_order_hasn.27t_arrived_or_it.27s_not_what_I_expected.<br /><br />Libertas
