				Hello all, in the past used bitfloor and loved it, but since it has been shit down I am left without a trading website. Who do you use? I have been looking into blue sky traders and bitinstant but both seem to be having delays in their transactions. <br /><br /><br />Thanks<br />Wizard

				There are no delays with bitinstant transaction. Only delays in the minds of the people that decide not to email bitinstant if things go awry. Save all the transaction info like they state to and if any problems occur and you email them with 100% of your info your transaction will be put through again. Usually only takes an hour in that case for them to redo the transaction. Plus you can use a fake name! Good luck!

				I usually use coinbase but its a 4 day waiting period to receive your coins. This time I couldnt wait so I tried bitinstant and the coins were in my sr account before I even got home from making cash deposit at walmart. Totally flawless!!

				recommend bitinstant. It took less than an hour, of course there was the percentages fee you have to pay for convenience.<br /><br />Also go to a store with the blue form to fill out. I had major problems calling in the wire transfer with a store that had a red phone. A neighborhood Wal-Mart was fast in and out. Walgreen had a red phone to call in the order and they screwed up the transfer three times before calling bitinstant support and heading to the WalMart instead.
