				Gotta post something to get to 50, so I figured I&#039;d make it a bit educational...<br /><br />I&#039;m no expert on the topic, but I do follow new developments closely. I&#039;ll just provide the current situation for those who don&#039;t don&#039;t want to look it up themselves.<br /><br />A little background first:<br />After the legalization amendment passed last Nov, the CO governor created a task force made up of representatives from LE, lawyers, growers, retailers, politicians and other interested groups. The groups mandate is to create policies and laws for growing and selling MJ in the state. The problem is, there are no similar laws ANYWHERE in the world for the group to use as a template (no, not even Amsterdam). They (along with lawmakers in WA) are trailblazing new territory that other states will most likely follow based on their success. To make it even harder, the amendment demands all laws be in place by 2014 when the first retail shops are allowed to open for business. So the task force has less than 1 year to determine a never before used framework of laws that satisfies parties on all sides of the issue. Quite a tall order! This group just started meeting regularly last month, so there is still a lot to be sorted out. <br /><br />Now the pressing questions:<br /><br />So, weed is really 100% no BS legal in CO?<br />- YES, weed/bud/hash/kief/hemp/cannabis and everything else associated with the plant is now legal in CO, IF you&#039;re 21 or over AND have less than 1oz on you. So if a cop frisks you and pulls a full OhZee sack out of your pocket, he SHOULD hand it back after telling you to stop buying shitty mex brickweed. <br /><br />What if I have my 2ft Graffix in my pocket too?<br />- YES, you can have a bong/pipe/vape with you. All paraphernalia is legal, even if its gooey brown with resin. Edibles too.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, where can I buy?<br />- NO, you can&#039;t buy any MJ yet, at least legally. The stores won&#039;t be open for another year, and its currently illegal to sell it privately. However it&#039;s legal to give away for free. It&#039;s a &#039;don&#039;t ask, don&#039;t tell&#039; scenario. LE doesn&#039;t care you have it, but don&#039;t tell them how you got it. A few sneaky people have gotten around this by taking a &#039;donation&#039; in exchange for &#039;free&#039; MJ, but it&#039;s a gray market loophole that may piss off those making the rules.<br /><br />Can I plant my seeds?<br />- YES, you can grow your own. Up to 6 plants at a time. But there&#039;s still a lot of details to be worked out. Bonus: the 1oz limit only applies to MJ you didn&#039;t grow. You can keep everything you grow yourself!<br /><br />I don&#039;t live in CO, can I still partake?<br />- YES, people 21+ from out of state visiting CO can possess (and eventually buy) MJ. The task force recently decided to accept out of state ID for the future stores. So pot tourism will be allowed. USA based Cannabis Cup anyone?<br /><br />Can I spark my spliff on the sidewalk?<br />- NO, you can&#039;t toke up anywhere you want. Right now you can only smoke inside private residences. The amendment allows for the possibility of &#039;coffee shop&#039; type businesses that are specially licensed to allow for smoking, but those decisions haven&#039;t been made yet. A couple brave business owners are already opening these types of shops.<br /><br />So can I take my fresh, dank sack out of CO?<br />- NO, I wouldn&#039;t advise it. While its legal everywhere under CO state control, its still very illegal under Federal law. This includes transporting it over state lines or taking it onto Federal property such as a national park or military base. It seems the Feds (under Obama) are taking a wait-and-see approach to the situation. For now they are pretty hands off. But that could change at anytime. Hopefully no one taunts the dynamite monkey. <br /><br />Can I get totally baked and take my Camry out for a spin?<br />- NO, there are already DUI laws on the books that make that illegal. But they are vague and inaccurate given MJ&#039;s legal status now. This is one of the task force&#039;s priorities and it is highly debatable since MJ can stay in your system for weeks after you smoked. There&#039;s still work to be done to figure out how to determine how stoned you are at the moment you are pulled over. <br /><br />As you can tell, there&#039;s still A LOT to be sorted out, and the rules are constantly evolving,&nbsp; but the good stuff is carved in stone in the amendment: You CAN legally grow and possess MJ, and you CAN (soon) go into a shop, choose between a dozen (or more) varieties of pro-grown weed and take it home to enjoy. How cool is that?<br /><br />Feel free to hit me up with questions, I&#039;ll do my best to answer them. <br /><br />PS, I don&#039;t follow much of Washington State&#039;s law, but I understand it&#039;s similar to CO except it doesn&#039;t allow for home growing. Perhaps someone with knowledge of WA&#039;s status can create a thread...<br /><br /><br />Peace &amp; Love<br />HS<br />

				Howdy howdystranger...<br /><br />What about the feds conducting raids within the state, claiming that it&#039;s some cross-state issue? Could they theoretically harass growers or dispensaries in this way? Apparently they&#039;ve already done that to MMJ dispensaries in Cali.

				I do not think the feds are going directly after dispensers I think they are going after those that rent the property. Using Civil Forfeiture I could be wrong but I am pretty sure that is what is going on. If you do not know about Civil forfeiture it is total bs it not Eminent Domain were they take your property like for a school or road this is totally different. <br />Clearnet link and story about a recent case<br />http://ij.org/massachusetts-civil-forfeiture-release-1-24-2013
