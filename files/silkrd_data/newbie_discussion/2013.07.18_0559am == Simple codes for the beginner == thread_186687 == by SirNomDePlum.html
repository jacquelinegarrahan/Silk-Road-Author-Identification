				CODES (not my original writing)<br /><br />Book Code<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Get 2 books that are the exact same thing. They must be the exact same, the same copyright date, the same edition, words, letters, language, everything, or else the code won&#039;t work. Hand a copy of the book to your partner and you will use the other one. (Dictionaries work best).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Learn about using the code. How do you create a book code? Well, there are several variations from the main one. Let&#039;s talk about the main idea. For example, you want to say &quot;These pictures were in a book.&quot; well, you will have to search for these words in the book. The tricky part is if the book has all these words or not. If so, read on. If not, get another book and try again. Remember, a dictionary will never lack words. When you find a word, record the page number. Say like the word &quot;These&quot; is on page 212. Well, the first 3 digits of your code is 212. Then, you find the row of words. For example, the word &quot;these&quot; is in row 4 of the book you are using. So now your code is 21204. Notice how I put the 0 in front of the 4 to make it a 2-digit number. Now, say that &quot;these&quot; is the 7th word in the 4th row on page 212. Your code will be 2120407. Using this code, every code should have 5, 6, or 7 digits (depending on if the book has 1000 pages or more; 9 or less rows; or 9 or less words in each row).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Test it out with a partner. Go ahead, try it out! Once you learn this simple but effective code, it will be really hard for an enemy to break it.<br /><br />Dictionary Code<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The dictionary has been the most popular book used to create the book code. However, dictionaries are usually printed in 2 columns, so you will have to adjust the formula a bit. Start with the page number, adding 0s to make it a 3 or 4-digit number. Now, you find the column that it is on. Say that the left and right columns are 1 and 2. Now, you find the word. Say like the word &quot;scandal&quot; is on page 1197 on the left hand column and it is the 3rd word in the column. Your code would be 1197103. Using this code, every word should have 6 or 7 digits in the code, depending on if your dictionary has 1000 or more pages.<br /><br />Pig Latin<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Pig Latin isn&#039;t hard to master, and it has nothing to do with pigs or Latin. It isn&#039;t a very hard code to break if it is written out. However, if it is spoken preciously and quickly, it can be an effective code.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Identify words that begin with a vowel (vowels vary within language to language). If it does, simply add &quot;ay&quot; to the end of the word. For example, ear becomes earay, arch becomes archay, and insulation becomes insulationay.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Identify the words that begin with a consonant. If it does, move the first letter of the word to the end and add &quot;ay.&quot; If the initial consonant sound is made up of two letters, like TH and CH, you move both to the end and add &quot;ay.&quot; For example, trunk becomes unktray, glasses becomes lassesgay, and measles becomes easlesmay. It isn&#039;t hard; in fact, it is really simple to master Pig Latin. If it starts with a semi-vowel, like y and w, the same way applies.<br /><br />Turkish Irish<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply put ab before the first vowel of a word. For example, feet becomes fabeet, and grudge becomes grabudge. Again, just like Pig Latin, this code works best when spoken.<br /><br />Word Clue Code<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This code is simple (yet easy to break). Certain words are instructions, like &#039;meet me at the book mixed-up hops&#039;, which means &#039;meet me at the book shop&#039; because &#039;hops&#039; scrambled is &#039;shop&#039;. You could do &#039;reversed&#039;, making a word spelled backwards; &#039;scrambled&#039; or &#039;mixed-up&#039;, meaning to anagram it; or &#039;sounds like&#039; meaning the word sounds like it. Unless you are using a sandbox, this code is too easy to use to fool people, and complex variations will have to be used in order to counter this problem. You also need to prove that this zzbz sgssbs xhsa (code) will be understood.<br /><br />Ciphers<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Understand what a cipher really is. What kind of cipher do you want to use? There are only two types of ciphers you could use: transposition and substitution. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Substitution ciphers are easier to break, but transposition ciphers are not as easy to use. A substitution cipher is that you substitute one letter and replace it with another letter or symbol. A transposition cipher is where you transpose or rearrange the position of the letters.<br /><br />Caesar Cipher<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Caesar Cipher shifts the alphabet 3 places. A becomes X, B becomes Y, C becomes Z, and so on. So if you were to write &quot;Meeting tomorrow at station,&quot; you would write it as Jbbqfkd qljloolt xq pqxqflk.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Try it out. Make sure that it shifts the alphabet three places. Not two, not one, not four, but three.<br /><br />St. Cyr. Slide<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Caesar only shifted the alphabet 3 times. But the St. Cyr. Slide is a more versatile cipher. You can shift the alphabet so that A becomes K, B becomes L, and so on. Or you could say that A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The St. Cyr. Slide should follow in the same direction. This means that you can&#039;t use random letters. If you did, the cipher letter would easily turn up in the same place as the original alphabet. You can also use numbers. say that A = 1, but 1 becomes 4. Again, these are all variations, so you can try out some of your own.<br /><br />Keyboard Cipher<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Get a keyboard, and make sure that it has all 26 letters of the alphabet. This is recommended if you are typing your message on the computer. You will need a Qwerty type because keyboards from different countries will have different letters.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The keyboard is kind of like the St. Cyr. Slide. However, the alphabet on the keyboard (locations) are different from plain alphabet. You can shift the keyboard to one letter space to the left, so on your keyboard, H becomes G, F becomes D, and A becomes L (&quot;turn over to the other side&quot;). For example, if you wanted to write &quot;Call me as soon as possible,&quot; you would type it like this: xlkk nw la aiin la oiaauvkw.<br /><br />Date Shift Cipher<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Another way to send a secret message is the date shift cipher.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Pick a date. An example would be Steven Spielberg&#039;s birthday: December 18, 1946.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Write out that date using numbers and slash marks: 12/18/46.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Get rid of the slashes, leaving you with a six-digit number that you will use to encipher your message: 121846. Assume the message is &quot;I enjoy the movies of Steven Spielberg.&quot; Under the message, you will write your six digit number over and over until you come to an end: 1 21846 121 846121 84 612184 612184612 is the secret message. However, it is not done yet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Write out the alphabet from left to right.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Shift each letter of the plain text by the number of spaces indicated by the number below it. The letter I shifts one space, making it J; E shifts 2 spaces, making it G. Notice in the word message the Y shifts 6 spaces, causing you to wrap around back to the beginning of the alphabet, landing at E. Your final message would be: J gorse ujf usbjgt wj yugwmr yqkftfksi.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you wanted to decipher this message, simply reverse the process: write out the numerical code, then go back that many spaces of the alphabet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Date Shift Cipher has an added advantage into it in that it is fairly random - you can change the date at any time. This allows you to update your system much more easier than other ciphers. Famous dates, such as December 7, 1941 (12/07/41), should be avoided, however.<br /><br />Combining Ciphers<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can also apply several ciphers to each other, thus creating a stacked cipher.<br /><br />Concealment<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Understand the meaning of concealment. Codes and ciphers do not conceal messages; they replace it. Concealment is different because the message can be revealed, but is hidden.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concealment works much better if a string of words make sense with each other, making a legitimate sentence. Doing this will fool people much longer than nonsense words.<br /><br />Null Cipher<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A null is something that fills out secret messages when there are extra spaces left. You can use any letter, but E, T, A, O, and N are the most effective as they are the most frequently used. Q, J, Z, and X would look very much like nulls to serious code-breakers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Null Cipher is one of the most basic ways to conceal a message. This is a concealment tactic in which only certain letters in a longer message are meaningful. The rest of the letters in a longer message do a great job of hiding your real message. Below is a message using the null cipher:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Skunk avalanche vertical easy yesterday October usually remove serious everlasting lap forever.<br /><br />Check the first letter of each word, and it will solve out: Save yourself. That is the secret message, cleverly hidden in this string of 12 unrelated words. Of course, there are other ways to hide a message in this fashion.<br /><br />Space Code<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A space code is moving the space to another place in a message. For example, the message &quot;I am your friend&quot; could be Ia myou rfr iend. Again, this is a code where you will have to speak it to conceal it. If you write it down, a person could easily find out the message by looking at it from a relatively long distance from the paper.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The following are examples of space codes:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Me etm eat 34t have nuefo rame eting inth ebui ldin gin fron to ftheco rner.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ho wdoy ouge tt hats cre ensa ver?<br /><br />Sebald Code<br /><br />In this code, after the word &quot;ring&quot; appears in a Sebald coded message, the first word, and after that every 11th word until the word &quot;ring&quot; appears again, the message will appear. Here is an example:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The One Ring is skunk cope burn mud yam pope maim cool abs king he gong pong yaw jaw none now pow girl boy jail alive.<br /><br />The message, of course, is, &quot;Is he alive?&quot;<br /><br />Edit Tips<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Always send codes to agents on your side.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can make your own code by simply sliding around the letters in a word in random order like &quot; teem em ta het arpk &quot;. Meet me at the park!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; For the Caesar Shift, you can move the letters however many spaces you want, forwards or backwards. Just make sure it is the same for each letter.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you do make your own code, don&#039;t make it TOO complicated so others can&#039;t figure it out. It may be too hard for you to figure it out too!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When using the space code, feel free to add, remove, or even move the letters from one place to another to make it more difficult to decipher. Make sure that your partner understands what you are doing, or else it won&#039;t work for him/her. You can space it so that it is three, four, or five letters each and then flip them around.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When using Turkish Irish, you don&#039;t have to specifically use ab before a vowel. You can use ea, br, is, or any other plausible-looking letter combination.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Always dispose of the deciphered code.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Conceal your code in a spot where only the sender and the receiver know where it is. For example, take apart a pen of any kind and put your code inside of the pen and put the pen back together and find a spot (like a pen holder on a desk) and tell the receiver the type of pen and spot it is in.<br /><br />Edit Warnings<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you write codes carelessly, it will make the secret code more difficult to decipher for your partner, unless there is a variation of a code or cipher that was specifically designed to confuse the reader (except your partner, of course).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Pig Latin is used best for shorter words. Longer words do not work so well because the extra letters do not hide it as well. The same can be said for speaking.<br />
