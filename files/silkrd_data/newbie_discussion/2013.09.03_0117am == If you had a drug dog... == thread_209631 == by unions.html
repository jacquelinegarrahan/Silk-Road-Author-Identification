				I&#039;ve always fantasized about owning a drug dog. No affiliation with the police or anything, just a dog that could sniff out drugs. So I could take /buy them. I figured it would mostly just find ditch weed (just based on chance), occasionally (before the days of the road) whenever our dealers were re-uping or unreachable, me and my friends would sit around wishing there was a better way to find drugs.<br />A drug dog fighting for the force of good, so to speak.<br />Discuss, spam, whatever. I don&#039;t give a shit, just a thought.

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;d find as much as you hope.&nbsp; I used to walk a lot and I&#039;d always walk kinda in the ditch and never really found anything.<br /><br />Of course my city might not have as many people ditching stuff as other cities.<br /><br />I used to fantasize about having super hero drug sight, kinda like thermal vision except with drugs. Like if someone had a gram of heroin in their car I&#039;d see a burning image of it from outside.&nbsp; <br /><br />Man you start to think of some crazy things when you&#039;re waiting hours and hours to pick up!

				Go to a car auction and look for hidden stashes that may be in police siezure cars that haven&#039;t been discovered yet. My friend found a couple grand a pound of weed once.

				You could also train the dog to smell/detect money and run it though an auto junkyard.<br />It&#039;s possible to find wads of cash stashed away in hidden compartments.
