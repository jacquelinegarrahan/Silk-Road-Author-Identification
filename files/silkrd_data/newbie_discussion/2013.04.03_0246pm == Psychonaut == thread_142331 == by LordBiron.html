				Ello everyone, just had a few quick questions. I want to explore my mind with psychedelics and I want to record my experiences in a scientific way. Does anyone else do this or am I just fucking weird? Any advise on how to conduct my trip reports?

Many of my most respected authors did. If you haven&#039;t already, I suggest reading PIHKAL and TIHKAL, which are in fact veritable encyclopedias of drug experiences (basically, the author systematically synthesized a whole pharmacopeia of substances and took them, documenting it all in a scientific way). Beyond that, my favorite author is Robert Anton Wilson, who recommends documenting experiences when performing any sort of mind-altering activity. He was very influenced by Alistair Crowley who, while trying a very different system to psychonauts, also documented everything while practicing thelemic magik. Also Timothy Leary is another great writer and has written several books with guides to &#039;properly&#039; doing trips (he means &#039;in a meaningful and scientific way&#039;. Not sure I&#039;m with him on this point, but I do see what he means...).<br /><br />Personally, I would recommend documenting set (mind-set - how you&#039;re feeling at the time), the setting (where you&#039;re doing it) and dosage. I would also suggest doing it with someone who isn&#039;t tripping, or takes a much lighter dose, who can document as you go, else maybe keeping a voice-recorder running to document the trip as it happens. Then add your thoughts and feelings about it later, like after you&#039;ve had a sleep or something, to give your &#039;straight&#039; reflections on the experience. Maybe also keep a general diary/journal to see how your personality changes over time generally.<br /><br />Oh, but most of all...... HAVE FUN!&nbsp; ;D Never forget that!&nbsp; ;)
