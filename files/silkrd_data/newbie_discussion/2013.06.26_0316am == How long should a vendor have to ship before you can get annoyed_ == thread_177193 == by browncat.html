				New to SR and have ordered four times. Two vendors were right on point, packages came 2-3 days after order. <br /><br />However one domestic vendor was still showing &quot;processing&quot; after a few days and I wrote him, he responded saying he had four days to make the shipment (did not see that in the listing, only saw Priority Mail shipping option). To me if you tell people you are using Priority Mail, they should reasonably expect to have it in four days. <br /><br />Now I got another vendor who guaranteed shipment within 18 hours based on his listing and now almost 40 hours later, it still says &quot;processing.&quot; I wrote him but have not heard back. I kind of annoyed because when you order your bitcoins get tied up, you have no way of cancelling on your end to place order through a different vendor. <br /><br />So as a newbie I am asking, what should you expect from a vendor and when do you have a legitimate gripe to be annoyed (lack of patience)? I leave for vacation Friday and now because I am waiting on this guy I can&#039;t get bitcoins back to order from someone else, and I can&#039;t deposit fast enough thru Dwolla and what not, so I am nervous my vacation will not have supplies! <br /><br />Finally, I feel you should be able to leave feedback for cancelled orders. To me, knowing a vendor took your order when he did not have the item in hand should be grounds for negative feedback. That&#039;s what happened to me on the &quot;I have four days to fill&quot; guy, he sold the item when he didn&#039;t even have it yet. That&#039;s BS.<br /><br />Anyway all in all I love SR and wished I had discovered it sooner. Thanks for any advice to this noob.

				I think 2-3 days is a fair amount <br />Even eBay the seller has 3-4 days before they ship and that&#039;s normal packages <br />Vendors might not always be on Silkroad, have other jobs, have 100 orders to get through and package before yours&nbsp; there&#039;s lots of unknowns<br />

				Yeah I felt I may just be impatient on the first order, but didn;t know if that was the norm and on the orders where I received in 48-72 hours I just lucked into fantastic sellers. <br /><br />But if you advertise you are shipping out GUARANTEED in 18 hours, you should come through. Maybe he will come through and just did not update ship status. But otherwise you need to back your posting. Don&#039;t advertise fast ship and then make a guy wait a week.

				It does seem you got lucky the first 2 times but you are right all he is doing is over promising and under delivering which is bad for his business because people like yourself won&#039;t be returning customers. <br />That does suck for your sake I hope it has been sent and they haut forgot to mark it in transit <br />Goodluck

				Thanks TKS. I would not be so worried but it&#039;s my one week of vacation and you know I am jonesing to make sure it&#039;s going to be a GOOD week. I did not plan for this, cause I use Dwolla to fund and it takes 3-4 days to clear so I can&#039;t move bitcoins in time for leaving Friday. So I am stuck either waiting for this dude to come through, or for my order to be cancelled so I can get my bitcoins released. Is there a way to get your bitcoins released other than waiting for seller to release them?

				You can cancel after 4 days I think it is, I&#039;ve longest i&#039;ve had to wait for a vendor to ship was 1.5 days and I was upset with that...seems I&#039;ve been lucky.

				TKS there is a cancel button but it&#039;s grayed out, won&#039;t let me click. I am guessing they do this for seller protection, i.e. the shipment is in transit and you cancel it and the package is already out the door.

				I have yet to see a vendor&#039;s page that says it will take them more than 48 hours to send the package....but in truth they&#039;ve got up to 4 days before you can even cancel the deal so you&#039;ll just have to take the hit my friend<br /><br />one vendor took his time once and sent me my package 2 hours before I could cancel my order (and I would have done that)&nbsp; <br /><br />I think up to 48 hours is &quot;normal&quot;, the ideal should be 24 hours max

				GHB420 hit the nail on the head. You have to read the vendors main page as some do ship slow and are up front about it.

				I ship twice a week so sometimes people have to wait up to 4 days. But I make that clear in my listing and people have been pretty cool about it.

				I have had great vendors like supreme always come next day. But new &quot;good&quot; vendors like gotsitall seem to have the most issues. I am currently waiting on express ordered sunday and now tuesday night. I messaged and didnt get response after he sent tracking # and it read no package has arrived yet. Does anyone know why it says that? I have heard great turnaround times for gotsitall but now I am finding the opposite to be true. I could be over reacting but I pay express for a reason and if its not even at PO the next day when SR says in transit then something is up. I would have paid priority if I knew it would take two days or more. Any vendor that reviews say less than 24 hours till arrival should honor at least a two day to your door time for shipping. This time sensitive stuff is important for those of us with this monkey on our backs and we shouldnt have to wait (unless stated on vendors intro) longer than 24 to 48 hours till arrival. Has anyone had issues with post office not scanning the initial drop off??<br /><br />ANYWAYS PLEASE GOSTITALL GET MY PACKAGE OUT OR FEEL MY WRATH. LOL. KIDDING BUT NOT.

				My first order was &quot;guaranteed next day delivery&quot; and took about 2 weeks, which I wasn&#039;t very impressed by. Vendors vary a lot; my advice is give them the benefit of the doubt, mention in the feedback if it took a long time, and just don&#039;t order again from vendors who don&#039;t meet their claims.
