				I&#039;ve known about the Road for about a year now but I just &quot;found it&quot; and set up an account last month and 1BTC was freaking $28 when I signed up! They&#039;re going for $70 right now. It&#039;s so expensive. I don&#039;t have a lot of money right now and the increase price of Bitcoins is making it hard to obtain them in the first place to make any orders. I have a finance degree with a specialty in currency exchange and my honest theory is that the sudden rise in prices is coming mainly from speculation. People trying to make an investment on them. The sudden in rise in price makes me think that it&#039;s going to turn into a fast and hard bubble. Lets just face it, why do people want Bitcoins anyway? If not to buy drugs and other illegal things. I don&#039;t see much demand for them outside the black market. These people buying them in hordes and driving the price up will soon realize that they&#039;re making them to expensive to sell and thus cash out. They&#039;re going to drop in price once people start trying to profit off their investments. I just don&#039;t know if that&#039;s going to be sooner or later. I&#039;d say sooner, like in another month or two. <br /><br />Hopefully. I need to find a job quickly so I can start getting them before they raise even more. I&#039;m just going to call it and say if they reach $100=1BTC that the bubble will burst then.

				The value of bitcoins has no relation to what you&#039;re actually paying on SR. <br /><br />For instance, if product A is 1btc on Monday, while the exchange rate for USD ==&gt; BTC is $50 per 1btc, and say the exchange rate inflates to USD ==&gt; BTC $100 per 1btc by Friday, you won&#039;t be paying 1btc for the product. It will adjust with the inflation, so what was 1btc on Monday will be .5 btc on Friday after the inflation. The prices on SR automatically adjust to the bitcoin market, everything is a set prices in USD, but you&#039;re just paying the equal value in btc. <br /><br />The only way to can be screwed is if you buy bitcoin at $70 per btc and leave it in your wallet and the market crashes to a lower exchange rate. In vice versa you can also make money if you buy low and sell high. For instance, I had about $40 in my wallet a few weeks ago, well that $40 worth of btc is now worth $85. It&#039;s basically a stock market, but the actual value of the btc is irrelevant to what you&#039;re paying for product on SR.

				I think it can be a decent investment. I know someone that mines them that has just been sitting on them and he has over 900 which at todays price would be like $67,500 not bad for 9 months of minng but he is hardcore into it not like your average person that mines them.

				hhhmmm technical analysis would show that all financial markets move in waves plus lets not forget basic laws of physics &quot;what goes up MUST come down&quot;&nbsp; ;) ;)<br />As of writing this post bitcoins are at $75,&nbsp; we&#039;re definately going to see $80 then $90 and then $100, the beauty about bitcoins is that its so young so buying now in my opinion is still cheap because at the rate of the current uptrend prices might hit $150 or $200 before serious market movers decide to consolidate their positions. AND I&#039;LL BUY ON THE DIP ONCE AGAIN&nbsp; ;D

				BTC price increase doesn&#039;t change the dollar price of items on SR.&nbsp; The only effect is if you are holding BTC, they could increase or decrease in value while you hold them.&nbsp; But the prices on the road are tied to the exchange rate so don&#039;t sweat that.<br /><br />Personally I change the settings to display prices in USD rather than BTC.

				But if things are less in BTC you&#039;ll spend less, so you&#039;ll have to buy BTC less often than before. Also you can buy fractions of BTC, too.

				People are buying bitcoins now because they think the technology will be used to transform the way that money transfers (especially remittances) operate currently. BTC is the cheapest way to get money from A to B with costs that are priced in cents. Western union fees and wire transfer fees are huge by comparison. In addition to money transfer, people think that BTC is going to be used to buy products online instead of USD. It is to a seller&#039;s advantage to take money in BTC because credit card fees eat into their profits. There are a few other applications that BTC could be used in, and if it gets any real measure of mainstream adoption its going to rise exponentially in value even from its present location. The issue at hand is that BTC is not being used for these applications. People are betting that it will be used for these applications. If it doesn&#039;t get used for the applications, its value plummets fast and hard.

				thank god that SR sells based on a commonly exchanged currency...<br /><br />kind of on the same subject i was listing to an interview a while back and could of sworn that i heard that there was a set number of bitcoins that would be exchanged. once that number is reached then of course you would see the price of bitcoin rise. i will go back and find what i heard and share

That&#039;s not what I&#039;m worried about, it&#039;s just that higher the price for bitcoins the more I&#039;m going to have to save up to get them, which means budget tighter, go outside less, eat less, etc. Do you see what I mean? If it was like $25=1BTC and I have only $60 this month I could get two bitcoins easily and make a purchase, but with the price going to $80 it means I have to sit around and try my best not to spend that $60 and hopefully get $20 more. Even though at $80 I have the money for what I want to buy, enough to get what I want, it&#039;s not enough to &quot;jump over the hurdle&quot; so speak.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just need to get a job soon, but it&#039;s been really frustrating.&nbsp; :&#039;( Also I didn&#039;t know you could show USD prices on here. How do you do that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You don&#039;t have to buy one whole bitcoin. Did you get that degree out of a cornflake box?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Before coming here someone told me I had to buy them in whole coins. I stand corrected, no need to be a dick.
