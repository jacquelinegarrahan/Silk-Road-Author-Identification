				Hello this a review of the new cocaïne batch and speed from bungee54. (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/12c290570e)<br /><br />The offer was 1g cocaine and 1g speed for free for a review on the forum<br /><br />Due to the new policy I can&#039;t post anymore on the Bungee54&#039;s&#039; thread on the rumor mill as I don&#039;t have 50 post. I would be grateful if a mod could move this in the right place (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31665.540)<br /><br />I will do my best as my English is not so good ;)&nbsp; I will stay the more objective as possible..<br />I&#039;m a regular coke user since many years . I have the opportunity to have high quality in RL so when I buy something here I expect more than high quality . I tell you this because often with reviews, I would like to know the experience of the user who is reviewing...<br />I m not a regular speed user, but I like it sometimes.<br /><br />Review begin here : <br /><br />COMMUNICATION:<br /><br />Bungee &#039;s team reply always very quick and tells you when your package will be dispatch in just few hours <br />They are the top team with the communication . Very friendly and they will help you in any way they could. Some vendorshere needs to have lessons from bungee.<br />10/10<br /><br />PACKAGE :<br />I received the letter in 4 days EU (in transit the next day) . The &quot;outside&quot;&nbsp; of the letter was very professional, the inside could be a bit more stealth,&nbsp; but nothing to worried about . The products were&nbsp; inside a zip bag , inside another zip bag and vacuum . So, very good in all points. I would not say more about the package to protect us.. <br />9/10<br /><br />COCAINE :<br /><br />Weight was 1.00 gr <br />I m very picky on coke so when I first saw the zip bag , I was a bit disappointing as It was powdered and I didn&#039;t really like the texture of of it. ( I m more used to oily chunks)<br />But a soon as as I open the zip bag the powerful fragrance of good coke came into my nose and a smile came in my face ;) . <br />In my opinion the best way to test coke is to cooked it back . Then you can really see what you got in the hand. The other test is very subjective imo (finger test etc..etc..)<br />I cooked it (freebase) 0.50 gr with ammonia.. As soon as the ammonia touch the cocaine I knew it was good ;) After the ammonia &quot;wash&quot; I made 2 wash with water to remove ammonia...<br />The result was&nbsp; 0.45 gr &quot;rocks&quot; of the finest freebase you can get. I smoke several hits and it is very very potent ! <br />I snort the other 0.50 gr..The taste is very good on the nose and it didn&#039;t burn at all.. Very euphoric and smooth<br />So I can say without a doubt that this cocaine is more than 85% pure. This one is in my top 3&nbsp; SR cocaine.<br />I give it a 9/10.<br /><br />SPEED :<br /><br />Weight was 1.05 gr<br />Like I say I &#039;m not a big user of speed. So I will not do a long review.<br />The speed came very wet. The smells was very nice.. Good old speed smell&nbsp; . You know it&nbsp; !<br />I put 300 mg to dry and after one hour. I was able to snort 2 big lines of it.<br />I was very surprise how easy and smooth it was on the nose. Normally I don&#039;t like to snort speed as it hurts often the nose..<br />The effect was what you expect from good speed.. Keeps you awake&nbsp; and awake and awake and awake ;)<br />Very good speed I give it&nbsp; a 9.5/10<br /><br />CONCLUSION :<br /><br />Very good products by one on the the top team on the road ;) You can go with bungee eyes closed .<br />I will put another order for the cocaine right away<br /><br />I hope this review will be useful for silkroaders <br /><br />Thanks to the Bungee&#039;s team for this offer it was a pleasure&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />

				I bought 1g of Bungee&#039;s coke a while back. I was pleased. Someone had apparently sent a sample to a Dutch lab, where they said it was nearly 50% cocaine (89% is maximum). I think it sounds like a very fair estimation. It would be more attractive if the price tag was a little bit lower.

				I just ordered of C from Bungee over memorial day weekend.&nbsp; Order on Friday and received the shipment the following Thursday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Shipping Time i would give a 10/10 because i received it in 4 business days to easy coast US.<br /><br />Packaging 9/10 because the bag stuck to the glue.&nbsp; The stealth was perfect though...<br /><br />Quality I won&#039;t comment on because I&#039;m not an expert.&nbsp; I can say it was really clean though didn&#039;t block up my nose and i just felt great.&nbsp; I also got a gram of Sukey&#039;s C at the same time and personally I liked Bungee&#039;s better because of it&#039;s cleanness, but Sukey was A+ to.

				Woo Fucking Hoo<br />I got my G from Bungree today, and&nbsp; I gotta say, this is some world class cocaine!!!<br />Product/Packaging/Communications.......10/9/10<br /><br />Check this one off of my bucket list.......sample pure cocaine, or as pure as you can get it pretty much.<br /><br />Product- This stuff came as all powder , as expected from previous reviews. The taste is clean, not too bitter and it goes up the nose as smooth as a super models ass. Nice numbing, not so intense that you know it&#039;s just a cut, a numbing agent. The high is superb. It creeps up on ya and it&#039;s just perfect. No paranoia, no jitters , just a strong euphoria . I can&#039;t say enough about this C. I&#039;ve tried some of the best on the Road and this , hands down beats em all. Worth the wait, which was 14 days to the east coast USA. Size wise, I haven&#039;t got a scale but compared to some other G&#039;s I&#039;ve got it LOOKS huge. This stuff is a pleasure to sniff and about as close to perfect ads you can get.<br /><br />Packaging - 9 just because of the melted bag mentioned by others. I expected it however and was careful opening , I lost nothing but can see how if I wasn&#039;t expecting it I might have lost a little.<br /><br />Comms - There wasn&#039;t much need of communication but from the moment I ordered Bungee kept me informed.<br /><br />To sum it all up, Bungee&#039;s C is NOT hype. This is world class cocaine ladies and gentlemen.......<br />I did some C back in the 80&#039;s that I&#039;ve never forgot, thats how good it was. Since then, it&#039;s been the benchmark to which I&#039;ve compared all C since, been close a few times but never this close. In fact , I think Bungee&#039;s product is just as good, if not a little better.... My search is over&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Thanks Bungee!!!<br /><br />I also received an order of pure from Pablospuro today, ya, good day . I&#039;ll hjavta wait to sample that , will review later..

				Just got Bungees54 stuff. Not only was it incredibly fast shipping (5 days to southwest US), but the product was very impressive. By far the best blow I&#039;ve ever tried. One small .010 bump was enough to coke me up good.

				Although Bungee54 has announced that he will soon stop selling speed, I will finally go ahead and post my review.&nbsp; Given the current speed famine on SR, especially for those of us here on the west side of the Pond, I figure there must be one of two of you freaks out there who can use this info.<br /><br />Based on his excellent reviews and (alleged) test results in the cocaine market, as well as on one positive review from an acquaintance in the real world, I purchased some speed from Bungee about a month ago and offered to FE voluntarily.&nbsp; This is not something I have done previously in my first purchase with any SR vendor. <br /><br />The stuff was at my door in the western US less than a week after I clicked buy.&nbsp; I was expecting the quality to be decent but not great, because Bungee had both recently announced his plan to exit the speed market and dropped his prices (on speed but not on coke).&nbsp; Even so, when I opened the vac-sealed bag, I was a bit surprised to find a mustard-yellow clumpy paste with the strongest smell of any speed paste I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; I decided to put it aside until I had a chance to properly clean it up.<br /><br />Over the holiday weekend, I finally got around to cleaning up Bungee&#039;s paste, in the following sequence.<br />&nbsp; 1) The wet paste was weighed at 27.7g (11% over the 25g promised in the listing).<br />&nbsp; 2) After drying over vacuum, the weight dropped to 24.7g.&nbsp; The liquid filtrate was yellow and had a smell that was strong but still well short of the paste itself.<br />&nbsp; 3) The dryish paste was then washed thoroughly with (anhydrous) acetone and vacuum filtered again.&nbsp; &nbsp;The filtrate was an orange yellow, even darker than the paste and just as smelly.&nbsp; The washed powder was now completely white, but it was still quite wet and clumped.<br />&nbsp; 4) Finally, the white powder was lyophilized for an hour at room temp and between 10 and 20 mbar.&nbsp; The product was a fluffy, snow white powder that looked something like powdered sugar.&nbsp; The final weight was 19.8g.&nbsp; This is 20% below the listed quantity.&nbsp; The lowest I&#039;ve ever obtained by this method was a loss of 6%, and that was for pharm-grade powder.&nbsp; The amount dissolved away into acetone is therefore probably only ~15%.<br /><br />Alas, the mass spec was off-line.&nbsp; I apologize for the lack of legit purity analysis.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do my best to get back in for MS results, but that will likely not happen until around the end of the month.&nbsp; By then, Bungee may not be offering this stuff any more.&nbsp; For what little it&#039;s worth, bio-assay indicated a pleasantly clean product with potency that the subject could not distinguish from a control sample of an equal pharmaceutical grade racemic amphetamine.&nbsp; No pure d-amphetamine control was available for comparison. <br /><br />In summary, Bungee54&#039;s speed looked and smelled unexpectedly nasty out of the box, but don&#039;t judge a book by its cover.&nbsp; With a simple acetone wash and thorough drying, this stuff was up there with the best at a nice price.&nbsp; Any of you aspiring speed vendors out there, I recommend you consider following the procedure before you sell your product.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t require real lab facilities, just vacuum and acetone, and it will probably pay for itself.<br />
