				I read in FAQs that under no circumstances should you FE. However, I notice alot of vendors, some reputed require it.<br /><br />Example: SuperTrips<br /><br />has been a vendor for 1 year<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 1% of sellers with 96.3% positive feedback from more than 300 transactions<br />has 2780 fans - become a fan<br /><br /><br />This guy has 2780 fans but he forces anyone ordering less than $500 to FE. Does this mean he&#039;s not legit?

				I am sorry that I cannot answer your question. The wisdom is only that never ever FE.<br />I did and I have feeling am being scammed because my domestic order after 5 day has not arrived.<br />And the vendor is not responded to my message. And he was online.<br /><br />So never ever FE. Just find some other vendor.<br />If you asks you to FE and you say no. And he cancels your order than you can assume maybe has was planning on<br />scamming you.&nbsp;

				No, it simply means he has it like that. Some one that offers what ST does, kind of has the buyer by the balls, so to speak. He offers bulk amounts and whole sale prices that few other vendors can match, if any at all. A $500 dollar order to some one like ST, is peanuts..as it typically is to buyers of bulk ecstacy as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;On the other hand, many smaller scale vendors will also require FE under particular circumstances, I would imagine thats pretty much because they cant afford to take a hit on a no show pack, or on the chance that a buyer may try and fuck them. Scamming goes both ways around here, even though all you really hear about is the scamming vendors.. there has been many instances where a buyer will build a repour with a particular vendor, with smaller orders, then try and stiff them on a large one.<br /><br />&nbsp;The key is to shop around on a smaller scale than what your looking for, build trust and a business relationship with vendors, then work from there. Lots of smaller &#039;mom&amp;pop&#039; vendors will often work with their buyers, tailoring orders for individual custys. Hope that helps. Good luck.

				Yeah almost all vendors have some sort of FE policy for new buyers as a safety precaution for them I guess, but that&#039;s not the only reason a vendor may require FE, could be anything. They may be low on stock and can&#039;t afford to float alot of money in escrow etc. Or could be due to the crazy fluctuation of bitcoin as of recently. Honestly, just talk to the vendor. Send him a message and ask, just making contact and talking alone can give a vendor more trust.<br /><br />I guess an example I could think of would be FrankMatthews. He has a policy that everyone must FE. Since I myself never have and never would FE, I just sent him a message and got chatting with him, and just simply asked nicely if I may stay in escrow, and he said no problem.

				I am talking about DrugForYou a relatively new dutch vendor of coke, crack, heroine, xtc and weed.<br />He said he mailed the order on monday and this domestic and in the Netherlands mail is fast I should have had it<br />the next day or at most the day after.

Sounds like you got ripped off. You may not have, but it&#039;s likely. And because you FE&#039;d, there&#039;s nothing at all you can do now. Except for hope that the vendor didn&#039;t rip you off, and just hasn&#039;t read your message or had delays or something. Have you checked whether he&#039;s read your messages you sent him? Has he been online?

				There are many reasons why a vendor would ask you to FE <br />1. They have been scammed a lot from certain parts of the world and they dont want to go through SR every time they get scammed <br />2. Cash flow is a big problem with some vendors and they need extra cash to keep up with demand<br />3. They think that certain parts of the world (or any other than there own ) are high risk and they want to make sure they get there money even if it is intercepted .<br /><br />people get scared that there going to be scammed and you should always be cautious however if you have a repeatable vendor that you go to a lot there is no reason not to FE your just making there life easier <br />&nbsp;

				I would never FE, for anyone, under any circumstances. Maybe just MAYBE with one of my vendors that I&#039;ve been doing business with for a while and sr was tanking or coins were crazy (just to be nice). But that&#039;s it. Most my vendors ask that you never fe. Escrow is there for a reason

				I dont mind if the order is big or small. What I do mind if the vendor is talking about building trust then violates that trust. That just make my blood boil. <br />I dont care much about money never did. But I care about high moral values. <br /><br />I just cannot understand how somebody could scam somebody else.

				There are a lot of trusted vendors who do ask to FE until<br />certain conditions are met...but<br />just shop around dude you can always find others who use escrow<br />and eventually you will be able to buy from the ones you want<br />once you meet their criteria. It just is not worth being<br />scammed!<br /><br />Peace

				Generally if they&#039;re shipping a lot of product and need to keep the money flowing, they&#039;ll require FE. Or they&#039;re gradually building up for a megascam, like Tony76 or Supertrips or Lucydrop or EJDirect etc.

				I find that such a strange thought....<br />they ask to FE because they need to buy new stock ?<br />If you don&#039;t have enough income to buy new stock you do something wrong...I think.<br />...once it is working ok the orders will keep coming and everyday after the first order like say after 10 days every day the money comes in ...right?<br />If you&#039;re a vendor for some time and have over 300 sales....you have money to buy stock.<br />No need to ask for FE....ever

I honestly don&#039;t know the motive of many vendors who require FE. It seems more common when it&#039;s an international order and they don&#039;t wanna deal with the bullshit if it gets snatched by customs. It&#039;s tricky being a new buyer and finding a vendor who won&#039;t require it but there are plenty who don&#039;t so keep looking.

				And anyway. I just dont understand. Losing a costumer for what 150 euro. And I may we in the Netherlands we get<br />vacation money. So I would have order more. If every thing went right. He even told me that I would not regret ordering for him. After FE. That is just low man.<br /><br />Even if later on he still deliveries and treats his costumers well people like that should be shunned. To drive them out of businesses. People who abuse the trust of there costumers.

				Being a vendor, I definitely understand WHY vendors require FE. Vendors, too, have to pay for their goods, and when they have 50+ orders in transit, there is a substantial amount of BTC in the escrow system that is prone to bitcoin fluctuations, and cannot be used to re-up on their supplies.<br /><br />With that said, a vendor&#039;s legitimacy is seriously questioned when they require FE, even when they are well-established on SR. There are plenty of examples of vendors building up a reputation, then simultaneously lowering prices and requiring FE, and then going rogue with bundles of BTC.<br /><br />Best advice I can give is: NEVER FE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE THAT MONEY OR HAVE A VALID REASON TO TRUST THE VENDOR.

				FE is always bad...the reason they want it.....? that it is seized by customs? <br />That is why there is a policy and a refund.<br />That he need to buy stock...is that your responsibility?? <br />You are only buying from him...you are not his financial partner ...<br />Once the coins are finalized you have no where to turn....SR staff cannot help you, the coins are his!<br /><br />@jundullahi if there is anything I have you like...you&#039;re more than welcome and don&#039;t FE LOL

				&nbsp; What i can&#039;t understand is,- On the sr buyer guide it says- <br />&quot;NEVER go around the escrow&quot; otherwise &quot;we will be totally unable to protect you&quot; +<br />&quot;Our commitment is to total satisfaction for every purchase you make here.&quot; but <br />i&#039;ve come across to that every UK Heroin vendor asks you to FE unless you have 10<br />successful transaction, the only vendor who doesn&#039;t require it is TopNotch<br />who i was buying from and always had smooth transactions and good service<br />&nbsp;and i now have 9 successful transactions but unfortunately<br />&nbsp;on 2 different accounts ( my original account pin stopped working for some reason,<br />&nbsp;not because i forgot it, but it just wouldn&#039;t accept it, so i had to open 2nd account<br />because was urgent to make a purchase). Now for some reason TN doesn&#039;t have active listings anymore<br />and i can&#039;t buy my stuff anywhere else because everyone wants you to FE. At some point i had experience with <br />another well known uk H vendor, he asked me to FE which i did - got my stuff next day<br />&nbsp;( it was only 0.2 g), so when i purchased from him again and he asked to FE again, <br />of course i did ( it was 1g) and package didn&#039;t arrive. Every single time before<br />&nbsp;that and after it made my door (all were local vendors), <br />so my address is not black listed, and my concern is - whether it was sent or<br />&nbsp;i was scammed, I PMed him again after some time regarding my purchase, he asked to FE again.<br />But i&#039;m not doing it again!<br />So what do we newbies have to do to be able to buy safely!?<br /><br />I&#039;ve recently got an advice - to buy books or play lottery to get stats, but i don&#039;t need <br />them books and don&#039;t want to waste money!<br />How come SR tells us to stay on escrow always but allows vendors to ask people to FE!?<br />Wouldn&#039;t that be more fair to say something like &quot;newbies can&#039;t buy more then 0.2 g until<br />&nbsp;the....hmm what do they worry for, by the way? :) they are getting their money anyway after it&#039;s been marked &quot;in transit&quot;<br />P.S. If vendors can&#039;t afford the money on escrow they have to get business credit to settle their business!<br />

				I think that some &quot;trusted&quot; vendors selectively screw up orders on people with no purchase history simply because they can get away with it.&nbsp; It sucks, but I learned my lesson.

				When going escrow, if you don&#039;t receive your package, what is the process if you don&#039;t want to send the vendor your BTC?&nbsp; Or is there even a process to stop the Auto finalize? <br /><br />I ask because I would like to better understand the escrow system in its entirety. <br />

				NEVER FE as a rule.<br /><br />But as a newbie. You could FE on small orders with vendors that are really highly rated.<br /><br />Try to stick with domestic vendors. If for some reason you FE and you get scammed. You can still get you piece of <br />justice by report them spam the forums with information about there crimes against you. And keep on spamming. Add the name and address of the vendor that scammed you to your forum signature And keep sending them<br />message every day or so asking them if the have changed there mind. You could also you ask God to give you justice and punish the evil doers that scammed you.<br /><br />But as a rule never FE.
