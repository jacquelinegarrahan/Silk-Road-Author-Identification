				3/22/13 Heads up, Quantity is low we are having a issue, people are not finalizing after getting the stuff, they are waiting till they party. Finalizing is for when you get the product.. The rating and feedback is for after testing it.. we are now low on funds and have to bring orders to 1-5G and 1-10G Daily Sunday Thru Turesday&nbsp; these will be put up once a night at 6pm EST Im sorry. this is the only way we will have stock for a while for you guys..&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Hey,<br />Cousin Molly here. im new on the forums. if any one could help out and get the ball rolling. that would be great. trip reports would be great!<br />Here is the link<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6a33417d83<br /><br />Also, We do limit our Quantity to smaller amounts then most people on SR, the reason being we try and keep it manageable .. We cant and wont just Pump orders out, if we do that we will lose our time for Customers, Replying to your messages, and any one who has ordered knows the time spend doing our amazing stealth packaging.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				You should put a link to your vendor profile in here to get more traffic, if I don&#039;t have SR open so not having a link generally makes me less likely to actually view vendor pages when I&#039;m on the forums so I suspect there is probably others like this as well.<br /><br />Welcome, and hope you do well :)

				Here&#039;s the rundown on my experience with CousinMolly.<br /><br />Shipping: Package shipped out the day after I ordered, got to me right away.<br />Stealth: Very clever. For a minute I really thought I&#039;d gotten stiffed, but I found it eventually.<br />Product: Bag was about 100mg heavy. It was a light tan sand, not too much of a smell. Dissolved easily in water, no telltale salty taste that you get with some cut molly. I took 170mg and another 60mg or so an hour later.<br /><br />The roll was very nice. Lasted a solid six hours. I had some serious eye-wiggle going on for a while, but no other noticeable side effects. No jaw-clenching or grinding, at all. Felt very clean, lots of euphoria and warm feelings, not too much stimulation. It&#039;s the next day and I don&#039;t have much of a hangover. Got up and ran errands just fine.<br /><br />A very good deal all the way around, I highly recommend CousinMolly.

				Also, thanks for the extra CousinMolly. I&#039;m planning to use it for a candyflip later this month. It seems perfect for it, clean with no rough comedown.

				Order: Quick and easy, fast communication. Owing to my newbie status, I took the plunge and FE&#039;d after a lot of careful consideration, as per CM&#039;s request.<br /><br />Shipping: Incredibly fast. Arrived within 3 days of ordering.<br /><br />Stealth: Surprising and amusing. Did a double-take, then another one, then laughed for awhile as I unpacked the package and figured out how the stealth worked.<br /><br />Product: Smooth! Lasted an incredible duration, and even took a couple of bumps along the way with no serious ill effects. The come-down was very gradual and no serious grinding or overly-speedy feelings as I&#039;d experienced the first time I tried molly (might have been cut with something but had no way to test). Had a grand overnight event, and a mellow day after.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5, would do it again. Many thanks to CousinMolly :]

				I bought two grams of tan MDMA from CM and am very satisfied. FE&#039;ed due to my noob purchase stats but was never worried, in fact surprised how quickly the product arrived, shipped same day and only took 3 days to get to me. Stealth was good and rather amusing, needed to go to some lengths to access the product The product was also well packaged, without details it would be undetechable at the length of time it takes to ship. But the best part was the molly itself. As described the product was a tan sand with large chunks, rather than a fine powder (making it more difficult to cut convincingly). Licked my fingers after finishing the weigh process (72 mg overweight), and it was bitter, very bitter. Like so bitter the purity actually kinda scares me. I am going to be very cautious with this batch it looks like it could give me a really awesome ride. Thank you CousinMolly, I will definitely be a repeat customer.<br /><br />TL;DR Shipping 5/5 Stealth 5/5 Product 5/5 (though have not tried it yet) Communication 5/na (I never actually spoke to him other than giving my address, which in my mind is perfect service but decided to go with na so my opinion of silence can be factored out of the review, just thought I would note.)

				i got an order from cousin molly about 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; I have also received from its sister account Direct2you.&nbsp; Both have THE best stealth i have ever seen.&nbsp; most discrete.&nbsp; if you are worried about you roommate, girlfriend, or wife finding the goods, trust assured they will not.&nbsp; Also some of the best MDMA i&#039;ve currently gotten on the road.&nbsp; all people were impressed with that batch.
