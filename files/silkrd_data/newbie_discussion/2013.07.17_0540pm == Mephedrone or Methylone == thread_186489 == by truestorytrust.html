				Which one gives you that more euphoria high and less speedy feeling where ya just wanna chill and are in a great fucking mood, the kinda high where feel like your on truth serum or when your with a woman it gives you that every touch feels like the shit feeling....&nbsp; People in my area don&#039;t like the kind that gives that speedy feeling where when you come down feels like your coming down off coke or some shit.....

				Dont do mephedrone. There is too many coming up with new shit and calling it mephedrone. In fact it&#039;s not very safe to fuck with Research Chemicals at all. Between methylone and mephedrone I&#039;d pick Methylone

				methylone is good, a milder mdma. also you could give 4mec a try. nice mild energetic highs. bit of euphoria... but mdma is where the real euphoria is at.

				I know it&#039;s problematic for many people and there&#039;s lot of sketchy stuff out there, but I am a fan of mephedrone from time to time. I have never done more than 200 mgs in one setting and find it pretty euphoric and mashy, similar to MDMA. Methylone for me is speedier and more edgy.

				other than these alternatives being cheaper than mdma, is there any other reasons to opt for them? healthier? easier on brain?

				I&#039;m pretty sure there all just as bad on the brain if not worst seeing they haven&#039;t researched it enough yet I&#039;m only going this route until I get my bread up to afford some quality MDMA and the best way to do that is this route seeing that most cant tell the difference and the stuff that goes around here anyways people are so damn greedy they stomp the shit out of it which would make me look like I got the best shit they ever took...lol.&nbsp; But also trying to stay domestic untll I get my stats up so I&#039;m more experienced with how shit goes and don&#039;t have no vendors asking for early finalization, before I hit international as that&#039;s where the best quality comes from mostly and the best deals for MDMA. Going domestic would be pointless if your in it to make profit.

				i guess if i were in trust&#039;s position i would use 4-emc til i could afford mdma<br />thats 4-emc NOT 4-mec<br />you dont see much 4-emc on the road because its still legal everywhere<br />you can get it from rc suppliers easy for cheap you shouldnt have customs problems<br /><br />4-emc is the only thing ive had from the ecstasy family that isnt an mdxx but has made me want to chill<br />in fact the roll is downright almost sleepy<br />super no speedy edge super easy comedown<br /><br />in fact the roll is so laid back ppl might think theres smack in it since ppl just love to believe theres heroin in their ecstasy<br />i wonder if it would be safe to combine 4-emc and methylone 50/50 in a pill?<br />the sleepiness of the 4-emc and the stimminess of the methylone might balance each other out<br />but i have not ever tried this

				From what research I&#039;ve done even chronic MDMA users showed no noticeable mental deficiency when compared to non-users,so it&#039;s probably the safest on the brain at least.( Source Link: {Clearnet} https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3053129/ )The main worry of course is the rapid serotonin depletion which is going to leave you pretty down temporarily,any substitutes such as Mephedrone and Methylone are going to probably be much harder on the body and mind,I would stay away from any frequent use.

				Only plan on doing a couple flips with it as I said before and I wouldn&#039;t sell something to somebody I wouldn&#039;t buy myself in all honesty I am only going to flip MDMA or Methylone for a lil bit that grab me some dank bud on here cause the prices are very generous for someone that wants to flip...&nbsp; And of course the jail times are way less for bud as to controlled subtances and ya don&#039;t have to worry about people od&#039;ing on bud that&#039;s for sure.
