				G&#039;day guys,<br /><br />I&#039;am quite new to this forum, ordered a few times LSD on here but the qualitiy wasn&#039;t any better as I bought it from my own dealer.<br /><br />Since dew years I&#039;am fighting serious problems with money, I have a really big debt I need to pay the next year or I&#039;am in real shit.<br />You probably don&#039;t care really about my problem but that&#039;s not even the point.<br />I need someone who can help/teach/cooporate me making LSD. <br />This maybe sounds really stupid as for someone with really not any reputation on this forum but I&#039;am sure I can get all ingredients and stuff I need.<br />I also am willing to split the earnings in a good way.<br /><br />Is there some Vender or any Chemist that is willing to help me out<br />- All help would be appreciated<br /><br />-23<br /><br />

				not really, I used to help a friend in manufacture in amphetamine. But I never asked him to teach me anything nor he was about to teach me something..<br />So that&#039;s a no.

				Whew, well for someone with very little chemistry experience. The best method I can think of that takes the most error out of your hands is this one :<br /><br />Step I. Use Yellow light (Sodium bulb, HPS works)<br />5.36 g of d-lysergic acid are suspended in 125 ml of acetonitrile and the suspension cooled to about -20 C in a bath of acetone cooled with dry ice. To the suspension is added a cold (-20 C) solution of 8.82 g of trifluoroacetic anhydride in 75 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture is allowed to stand at -20 C for about 1.5 hours during which the suspended material dissolves, and the d-lysergic acid is converted to the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids. The mixed anhydride can be separated in the form of an oil by evaporating the solvent in vacuo at a temperature below 0 C, but this is not necessary. Everything must be kept anhydrous.<br /><br />Step II. Use Yellow light<br />The solution of mixed anhydrides in acetonitrile from Step I is added to 150 ml of a second solution of acetonitrile containing 7.6 g of diethylamine. The mixture is held in the dark at room temperature for about 2 hours. The acetonitrile is evaporated in vacuo, leaving a residue of LSD-25 plus other impurities. The residue is dissolved in 150 ml of chloroform and 20 ml of ice water. The chloroform layer is removed and the aqueous layer is extracted with several portions of chloroform. The chloroform portions are combined and in turn washed with four 50 ml portions of ice-cold water. The chloroform solution is then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated in vacuo. <br /><br />EDIT: However if you use this method, please get a HPLC/MS or something to test for purity and what not. Its incredibly hard and dangerous to make LSD and if you don&#039;t do it correctly the outcome could be quite hazardous.
