				I want to do a review and my experience thus far with SuperTrips. But I am not at 50 so I cannot post into the forums. But I know SO many people are searching for updates and such, and are getting antsy for the parcels to arrive.<br /><br />I will ANYWAYS. WHAT.<br /><br />So I placed my order on Jan 1. <br />Jan 3 he &quot;shipped&quot;<br />Jan 10th or so I FE (I shouldn&#039;t have but I figured it showed him I trusted him, via my previous dealings with UGS)<br /><br />EVERYTIME I messaged him he has responded within 24 hours. I was getting worried as this is my first purchase with him. I am STILL fully confident my parcel will arrive. NOT as timely as I would like BUT I understand the holidays were rough on him. I will update once I get my parcel, currently at 19 days to the East coast USA. Everyone have patience! I got antsy and was messaging him too much but he put me at ease..<br /><br />Where is everyone else at in my position? Once again be calm and patient :)

				Did you ever received your goods?<br />I saw SuperTrips just updated his profile page today and said he&#039;s on top of his shipping now.<br /><br />I just ordered from him too - hopefully there&#039;s no delays.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />Just received my goods today to USA

				I&#039;d like for Supertrips to be on his shit since his products are really tempting but I&#039;m just too sketched out from everything that I&#039;ve heard. I think that I&#039;d have to stay in escrow if I was dealing with him.

				I can say with certainty he will come through, or he will give you a 100% refund. It doesn&#039;t matter if your buying 25 pills or 2500, he comes through. Trust him a little and he will change your world :)

				Super Trips has been on SR for a long time and he is a legit vendor. Also I have had his product and I can tell you first hand AMAZING. I normally can take 300 mg to start off with and another 250 and hour later.... NOT with his shit, 200mg to start and 60mg an hour later and I can tell you I was floored. When it comes, enjoy and be safe. If you do not have a good scale that can read to the at least the hundredths, get one.

				Damn, my purchase stats are a LOT higher than most people and I still dont have 50 posts on the forums. Oh well..<br /><br />All of my orders from ST have gone through. He 100% refunded me once, but that was 2 days after I placed the order. I want him to be legit again, because I just dropped a lot of money on an order. I received one part of my order really quickly, just waiting on the other (MUCH more costly) parts.

				Well this is worrying. I ordered 20g MDMA from him last week. After a few days of being in &quot;processing&quot; he told me it will &quot;go out with the next batch tomorrow&quot; the next day it was set to &quot;in transit&quot;<br />I was going to finalize early because it is requested on his profile and he is &quot;trusted&quot; but glad I decided to search him on the forums first. <br />I&#039;ll update on this to let you know how it goes.<br />If i cancel and do not finalize, do SR still take their cut?

				I apologize for not updating this thread as I never come to the newbie section anymore. I fucked up.<br /><br />Do not order from ST! I have been waiting _ days. e FINALLY told me 3 days ago that he would RESEND the 5Gs i ordered. IF I get my goods then I will update this thread. But at this point I am not gonna hold my breath. <br /><br />I placed an order with XTC and I have much more confidence I will receive it as he is prompt in messaging me. Same goes for Powerade.<br /><br />UPDATE: ST stated it would be reshipped early this week. Once again he is vague and only has &quot;approximations&quot; rather then definite dates he says &quot;should be&quot;. I would suggest XTC or powerade...i will update when I get my goods from each vendor with shipping times.

				I just got a msg from ST today saying that he had saved my address in an encrypted txt file and his hard drive fucked up, thus losing my address and he requires me to send it again so that he can ship me the goods, even though he already said in a previous message that he shipped it 3 days ago. I too am no longer holding my breath, just waiting for the days to count down till I can click on resolve... my very first purchase and I can possibly get fucked.<br />.

				I placed on order on Jan. 5th and it has yet to arrive. Having a lot of trouble getting responses to my messages. He told me a week ago he would give me a refund and that he was forwarding my request to someone (I dont know who).&nbsp; Still dont have any money in my account and he won&#039;t respond to my messages. I don&#039;t really think he&#039;s trying to screw me over. I think he is probably overwhelmed but that doesn&#039;t matter. This is a business and you can&#039;t treat your customers the way he has been doing. He also said about a week ago he just upgraded his customer support and that messages should be answered in a matter of hours but that is not the case. I don&#039;t know what else to do. I will never finalize early for him again that is for sure. There are many other dealers that have just as good of a product at better prices and offer better service.

				really? I haven&#039;t found anyone else that offers 84% pure MDMA (which to my understanding is the purist it can be) <br />Can you tell me the name of a vendor that offers this?

				Today he sent me the same message that he has sent to a few people, that his files got corrupted and he needs my address again (3rd time I have sent it)<br /><br />We will get our product but it seems we just had to wait until he had the product himself. That is my guess. So back to holding my breath! Saying he will not read my message until tomorrow. I should get my product in about 10 days. soooo 10 days and counting! (for the 3rd time)<br /><br />By the way I got my order from Powerade in 6 days! I am making another order with him in a few days. Great product and even better service. IF you want MDMA fast, order from Powerade. He is shipping from across the pond and is only 3 days longer then domestic. You cannot beat that.
