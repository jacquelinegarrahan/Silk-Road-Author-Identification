				What return address...if any should be used...?....<br /><br />Does one just seek out an address at random and hope the mail never gets returned...?<br /><br />I happen to be in an area where there are several empty homes...I see their mail piling up and the owners come only once or twice a year...seems like a good way to recover my item if it gets sent back...<br /><br />of course it does carry a little added risk as it is close to home...<br /><br />Any thoughts...?

				From my own perspective as a vendor (but not yet at SR) I would completely make up a random address for Intl shipments, for domestic it doesn&#039;t matter and don&#039;t bother <br /><br />Interesting that you have an empty house that you could possibly use, but then you&#039;d have to commit a crime to enter it and retrieve your goods if they were returned. You&#039;d need to break in every week to check on things I presume, as you would get no notification of what, if anything, was sent back until a reasonable amount of time had passeed from a buyer crying no show?<br /><br />If you were busted for that, and it led to everything else tumbling down as a result then youd be completely fucked and kicking yourself.<br /><br />Package properly, use the correct materials, hide the contents as best you can and stick on a mickey mouse address for returns. Then its gone whatever happens to it and there&#039;s fuckall you can do about it, would be my take?<br /><br />You&#039;d best think of a cost/benefit analysis here and decide whether its worth the risk of breaking and entering on a regular basis just incase? You risk the whole house of cards come tumbling down because some old granny called the filth to report suspicious activity :)<br /><br />terp

				Thanks or the excellent advice...I tend to agree....<br /><br />I&#039;m not worried so&nbsp; much about losing the shipment...part of doing business...what I don&#039;t like about some random address is what that person will then do with the envelope...a clue is let hanging...<br /><br />This empty house has no mailbox and the carrier just leaves letters out on the steps...everybody cuts through the yard anyway...so it&#039;s not like trespassing...<br /><br />This is a quiet area and I often walk through there myself...<br /><br />I&#039;m leaning heavily to just letting it be...using some random address away...to heck with it...<br /><br />Appreciate the great input...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper...

				Actually it&#039;d be cool if vendors could get their gear back. I know in the UK you can anonymously rent a mailbox. &#039;Mail Boxes Etc.&#039; is one; they must have them in the US too. Assuming they&#039;re really secure enough they might be worth the 30 quid/month

It has to get delivered somewhere. On the off chance that the envelope doesn&#039;t make it to the intended recipient, it is better that the envelope land in the hands of a citizen rather than be discovered by a postal inspector who possibly decides to look at an undeliverable piece of mail.
