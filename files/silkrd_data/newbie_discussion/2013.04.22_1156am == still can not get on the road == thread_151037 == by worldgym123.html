				I&#039;ve been able to get on every day however at some times of the day it is very laggy or doesn&#039;t work at all. I can always sign in though.<br /><br />Have you made sure all the add-ons and extensions on&nbsp; your clearnet browser are disabled?

				Ok, I&#039;m no expert, just a raw newbie. I use fire fox for surfing everything that is not SR related, this is called clearnet and should NOT be used for anything SR related, at all.<br /><br />Everything SR related should be done through onion and is called &#039;darknet&#039;. Doon&#039;t mix the two, like trying to log into farcebook on onion, or trying to access your bitcoins through fire fox.<br /><br />In firefoc/chrome/whatever Go to &#039;Tools&#039; then &#039;Add Ons&#039; and click disable for everything you have running. <br /><br />Stuff like Java and Adblock. Then click on Extensions and disable everything there as well, stuff like silverlight, adobe, yahoo, etc etc<br /><br />It shouldn&#039;t be too hard to find. Just look under Tools, or Options, or Add ons in which ever browser you are using for clearnet.<br /><br /><br />Hope that makes sense?

				Forgot to mention Plugins as well, disable all your clearnet Plugins as well as the extensions.&nbsp; :)
