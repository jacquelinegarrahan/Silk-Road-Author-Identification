				I&#039;m a new member. I came here because I was under the impression I could obtain safer products from more trustworthy sources with greater ease than I could in the streets. The Amazon.com-like rating system and an apparently thriving community seemed to support my beliefs. However, my experience has let me down.<br /><br />Why is there no vending consistency here? Why are there no suppliers online; why do we have to deal with middle men?<br />It&#039;s a fulltime job to stay ontop of all the &#039;new batches,&#039; and by the time the reviews paint a clear picture of the product it&#039;s pretty much sold out. How are there no sellers in this network reliably producing a single high-quality product? It&#039;s as simple as doing something right, and continuing to do it. What am I missing? It&#039;s my understanding that The Road is relatively safe, and the demand is CERTAINLY there. Why aren&#039;t high quality, consistent suppliers saturating the market? Why isn&#039;t there even ONE of them among the unreliable middle-men dealers sporadically receiving and supplying mystery &#039;batches&#039; (if there are any decent suppliers out there, how come none of them seem to be making the same product twice?)? Are we on the path, just not there yet; a little more time and we will attract the right suppliers?<br /><br />I have a vision of The Silk Road and it&#039;s beautiful, a world of clear possibilities for buyers, and much money to be had for sellers. But we&#039;re not there yet... Why aren&#039;t we? What am I missing? <br />I&#039;ve had half the mind to pick up some chemistry books, quit my day job, and fill the gaping hole myself. As it is, I&#039;m beginning to get the impression I&#039;m better off back taking chances on the streets then online. Atleast there I don&#039;t have to wait 3-53 days for shipping.<br /><br /><br /><br />PS. Most of my hours upon hours upon hours of research has been in the LSD and MDMA markets. Those are the primary areas I&#039;m commenting on.

				I would have to agree with you on LSD.&nbsp; No one wants to go through customs if you don&#039;t have to so I look for vendors shipping from the USA and there aren&#039;t many.&nbsp; Then out of the few that do some require FE which I have already burned by on my very first order!!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about making my own but I&#039;m thinking about hitting up Chem students at Universities!&nbsp; There seems to be one good vendor constantly selling LSD but he does some weird lotto thing and why in the world would I want to give someone my expensive Bitcoins to buy into the lotto to not win and give my money away!!

				LOL dude, you have to understand&nbsp; and take into considerations the masses upon masses of business that takes place here, daily. Id call it safe to say that any one given day here, for any one star LSD vendor, or any one top rated well renowned &#039;anything else&#039; vendor..more transactions are carried out than any street dealer youve ever known does in a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;Think about what these people go through to bring us their product, anonymously and securely no less...

				Don&#039;t get me wrong, I appreciate the services that current vendors give&nbsp; :D, I just expected (understatement) there to be others giving superior services.<br />There&#039;s SO MUCH MORE MONEY to be made here, and SR isn&#039;t all that new, I&#039;m just baffled as to why there aren&#039;t veritable factories pumping product into SR in a nice and friendly streamlined fashion. Who wants to be a millionaire? ...Bueller?<br />I actually am wondering if there are some reasons I&#039;m unaware of... not simply complaining.

				Yeah this place is pretty awesome and useful. Just use it wisely. I love that because of Silkroad that everyone has access to the drugs we want and the drugs we need. The government can&#039;t do anything about drug use. We don&#039;t care about drug laws either so either way people will continue to get high because it&#039;s out of our own free will.

				Listen, I see your main concerns completely all demand, and while there is supply it is not always there reliably, or untrustworthy.... <br /><br />But the fact is. <br /><br />Drugs are illegal.<br /><br />These dealers have gaps in their incoming product as well. Where you are able to buy your drugs on here, what are the vendors to do?<br /><br />They must buy theirs in real life, facing all the risk I am sure you are aware of but on a much much larger scale and higher risk/reward ratio.<br /><br />Even the people that produce their own, they must find the base products to start synthesizing with. Not always a easy feat when you are buying enough government flagged product to feed the needs of thousands of SR customers.<br /><br />Please by all means if you feel like breaking bad and want to start synthesizing or pressing your own product. Do it. <br /><br />Then you will see all of the qualms and setbacks vendors on here go through.<br /><br />Legit legal business&#039;s can operate on a large taxed regulated product,&nbsp; always having the employment, raw materials, legal leeway to make sure that they have their product on every shelf... <br /><br />Shit works different and very oddly here for a reason.<br /><br />SR is relatively new in the cyberspace spectrum, and so far its working 100% in my favor so I am not bitching. <br /><br />There is only more improvements to be made as there is only more money to be made.<br /><br />Hope this makes sense.

				Thanks, White 0ut <br />I suppose I GREATLY exaggerated the amount of people who would both be willing to stick their necks out to be filthy rich, and have the potential to build the right infrastructure. Still unbelievable to me, but... live and learn I guess.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have too many other less exciting obligations in my day to day life to go Breaking Bad just yet. I&#039;ll be sure to let you know if I do&nbsp; ;) Although I might be better suited to attack prohibition laws themselves.
