				Yes, with any luck I&#039;d say within the next week BitInstant should be back up and running at full speed.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping anyway, I don&#039;t mind using Ziggap, but it takes longer for sure.

				Is this why I can&#039;t do a cash deposit to bitstamp transaction through them anymore?&nbsp; That seems to be the fastest service out there.&nbsp; I used bitfloor today and I am still waiting to see coins in my SR account.

				So... This whole issue was caused by the hackers calling someone up on the phone and pretending to be the administrators they were stealing from? What a low-tech way to run such a high-tech heist... Is that what &#039;social engineering&#039; mean? lol.
