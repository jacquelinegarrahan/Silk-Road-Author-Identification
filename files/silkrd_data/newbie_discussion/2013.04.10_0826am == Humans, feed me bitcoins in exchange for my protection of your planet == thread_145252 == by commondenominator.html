				&nbsp;;)<br />So it goes like this: I am diversifying my portfolio if you will... i wish to add your planet- earth, I believe you refer to it as, to my list of planets to safeguard. I tried to give this offer to the plutonians in this solar system but they did not appease me, thus a planet named Pluto no longer exists. I see your digital infrastructure has evolved to the point where your finite digital currency is valuable enough to purchase parts for my red sun enhancer. I will safeguard you for free but I require donations in order to handle my overhead costs. I will answer any questions that you may need to know before trusting me as your greatest defense. Remember. Small donations that you will not miss only. Invest the rest in ftl travel mechanisms since that is what is holding your planet back from new evolution. I currently have 2 bitcoins for anyone wondering. <br />Do not forget to ask questions if you doubt me :P <br />SR username is c0mmondenominator<br /><br />I hope to be available for your planet for centuries. Thank you and don&#039;t forget-never FE! Unless you are a baller like that.

What makes it valuable is that it is being mined. Networking and raw processing power are used to create something purely used for trade. The structure of the coins is used to add capabilities to ones data pool if you will. When used the compressed data is used as processing power.

Ftl travel is not really travel in the traditional sense. Space in not travelled through in a typical point a to point b fashion. There is more to it than that. And while wormholes and slip space ruptures that your Hollywood movies explain sound interesting they are not the way. You would not survive the trip through those. It is also fucktardedly hard to create those at will.
