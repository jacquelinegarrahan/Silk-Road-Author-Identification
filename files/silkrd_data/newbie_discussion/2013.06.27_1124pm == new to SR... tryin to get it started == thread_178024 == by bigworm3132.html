				hello all out there on SRF... i am a new buyer from the northeast who is here to see if i can add SR to my list or connects... first off i been reading and researching for a wile on how to SR it... the thing i dont like is how they say to buy small at first.. well for me an LB is small... i dont wanna buy eights and get my score up... i wanna go straight bulk... hence the problem... i already got taken by the fucker legalizemj... 3000 down the hole... anyway, i also have tryed to buy bitcoins over the road... noone wants to let me get 3 stacks worth of them off them... i am in the life, burn and stuff is how i make my living... i was hoping to add SR to my list cause buying local kinda sucks... i mean there no way SR could take all my business... shipping is just too slow and stuff... but i would like to add it to the mix... anyway i welcome all advice and say hello to all my fellow roaders... good luck in your searches people

				I would go outside SR to get coins.&nbsp; localbitcoins and bitbox both work.<br /><br />You may not want too but I would buy some smaller amounts first and find a vendor that you want to do ongoing business with.&nbsp; If you are wanting to setup a long term business arrangement, take the time to find someone you want to work with, it will be worth it.&nbsp; Just because this is illicit doesnt mean you shouldnt use common business approaches.&nbsp; Feel some of the sellers out and you&#039;ll find one that will consistently meet your needs.

				you could always wire money from your bank account over to gox, pass the bitcoins around to a few different addresses, then spend them as you see fit. The passing them around to different addresses keeps you clean even if they look up the blockchain info... the only way they can track you is through the wire transfer, but tons of people use bitcoin for legal practices everyday anyways.

				oh... just to add.. i live completly off the grid so to say... i stay in corporate houseing that i pay cash for.. i have no bank account or credit card... not even a prepaid one but i thinking of getting one... my cars are all in family members names from out state... so like i said, i new to SR, but not to the life... i just spent too many years judging people by looking them in the eyes so to say... i cant do that here... i was always good at reading people... i mean in my life the differece between knowing if someone is lieing to you or not could be the difference between spending years in jail or dead or getting paid... i just gotta move a lil slower... and take my time... i know i will get this right.. and then its on..
