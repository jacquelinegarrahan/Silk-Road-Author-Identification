				Hiya,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading up and down the wiki and forums and I&#039;m still unsure exactly what precautions i need to take. There seems to be lots of different advice about whether to use your real name or not and PGP isn&#039;t mentioned in the buyers guide but is everywhere else. What should PGP be used for anyway, is it just for addresses? Also can I store my PGP configuration on my computer or will that show I&#039;ve been doing things on Silk Road?<br /><br />At what point should you start worrying about these things, like does it really matter when it&#039;s only a few grams of whatever?

Fuck no. especially i the UK. LE will be kicking in your door lol. <br />PGP is basically a program that encrypts and decrypts messages, which is a must do for sending information especially on sensitive info. <br /><br />heres a really good tutorial on PGP encryption, <br /><br />http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />if you stay safe, take as many precautions as you can, you&#039;l be safe and when you do actually get the hang of it, You actually get a sense of accomplishment, <br /><br />hope this helps all the best

				I never use my real name. PGP is a good idea for entering your address. There is a pgp club here on the boards to instruct you in a how-to.<br /><br />I use Kleopatra. Use a strong passphrase and you should be good. If you are ultra careful, transfer all your naughties to a bootable USB.

				Thanks for all the advice, I&#039;ve learned how to use PGP so I&#039;ll be doing it for all my new orders. I did one before but it was only a small one and the seller didn&#039;t provide their PGP. Rather than using an SD card i think I&#039;ll store it all in an encrypted folder, I think that should be just as safe as long as they don&#039;t take my laptop while it is still logged on.<br /><br />As for bitcoins I&#039;ve tried bitbargin and it seems pretty good, only problem is I have to do a bank transfer to the seller, is this safe? I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s fine since bitcoins can be used for all sorts of things.<br /><br />HeatFireFlame, I&#039;m a bit confused since the seller has to get your address anyway, I thought PGP is just to stop the SR staff peeking or something? Can&#039;t see a way round that. I could use a friend&#039;s address but then they&#039;ll have the same problem.

				Here&#039;s a computing setup that&#039;s working for me at present:<br /><br />Main operating system is Ubuntu Linux, this may not be your bag but I prefer it to Windows. My laptop has plenty of RAM.<br /><br />Download KVM and virtual machine manager through the software center. Download Tails ISO from the web. Buy the smallest SD reader you can get hold of (if your machine doesn&#039;t have an SD card slot) and two micro SD cards.<br /><br />Plug in one of your SD cards and open the Virtual Machine Manager app, create a new virtual machine which has no hard disk and its CD/DVD drive is the ISO you downloaded. Choose advanced setup and &quot;add hardware&quot;, choose storage and write the path to your SD card (usually /dev/mmcblk01 but Ubuntu&#039;s &quot;Disks&quot; app will tell you) as an existing device rather than making a virtual hard disk, make it a USB one not IDE.<br /><br />Before powering on your virtual machine, go to a console and type &quot;sudo swapoff -a&quot; which will ensure that none of the virtual machine&#039;s memory is ever written to your local hard disk. Do this every time before you boot it up. Once it&#039;s booted up, open the disk utility in Tails and encrypt your SD card with a super long password. Power off the VM and insert the second SD card, encrypt with a simple password and stick some porn, a few pictures of your gf&#039;s tits, a ranting text about why your boss is a cunt, your Internet Banking logon details and password etc.<br /><br />The strategy here is that Tails forgets everything when it is rebooted, all your shit will be lost unless you save it to your SD disk. You pop out the SD card and swap it for your dummy one whenever you&#039;re not using it. The SD card is so small you can hide it in plain sight and nobody will find it, you can switch between Silk Road and Facebook at the push of a button instead of having to reboot and mess with conspicuous USB drives and stuff.<br /><br />The down-sides: If you&#039;re ever busted then the law can see that you&#039;ve got Tails on your system, since the ISO and virtual machine are there. Inserting the SD card may leave a trace in your logs, so the law may be able to prove that an SD card exists. If your machine ever gets hacked, your VM and passwords and all your shit are then insecure. I can&#039;t think of a good way to get Bitcoin working in this system, since it needs so much fucking space. My bitcoin client is outside my VM, which isn&#039;t ideal.

				Thanks awhiteknight. I&#039;m using Arch linux so i&#039;m quite familiar with this sort of thing. Perhaps I&#039;m not that paranoid in the end but I think encryption should be enough for me. I&#039;ve read that with today&#039;s technology it would take years to crack a strong password. They would need to lock me up and force me to give it to them to get in. My main worry is giving out my name and address to the sellers, how do i know they wont inform the police?<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m feeling quite a bit happier now I&#039;ve set that up.

				Well you see PGP encrypts messages, So it&#039;s an especially good idea to use it for sending your name and address, i personally would use it for normal messages also. <br />The seller can see your real address and name, But even if LE got his computer they would need his pass to read your encrypted messages. hence your name and address is safe. even more so if hes got it on a usb which gets snapped/flushed as soon as shit goes down.

				I personally run Tor and PGP (good guide and simple pgp app http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/) from a USB drive which is encrypted via Trucrypt.&nbsp; Encrypted folder is slightly less secure in the fact the files are on the computer all the time vs hiding USB stick.<br /><br />Granted security measures required is based on your intended use (small customer, big customer, dealer, type of product etc).<br /><br />My basic advice is:<br /><br />1. Create a new TOR identity, used only via TOR for your black/grey market interactions.&nbsp; Get a matching Tormail account and PGP key pair.&nbsp; Many people use proper tormail address in their PGP key just in case SR goes down and they want to communicate with trusted members.&nbsp; Many people use bogus emails in PGP keys, it is up to you.&nbsp; As long as you use PGP encryption in your tormail, you should be ok using a real address.<br /><br />2. Real vs Fake name/address.&nbsp; Personally I use real, I figure I am lazy and too small of fish.&nbsp; General consensus is that fake names can give you reasonable deny-ability but could also arouse more suspicion from your local mail delivery folks and could also cause mailing errors.&nbsp; My opinion... if you are worried about real name usage, go the full mile... get a fake id and then a PO box of some sort and just use that &quot;real&quot; name lol.&nbsp; Also if you are about to get busted, a fake name probably won&#039;t save your bacon anymore then just not opening the package.<br /><br />3. Use PGP for any identity sensitive data, most vendors frown on using PGP for simple questions/communications.&nbsp; They receive a lot of messages so encrypting/decrypting can become a chore also considering how slow SR is on TOR.&nbsp; Obviously if SR goes down or if you are using alternative communications then PGP more.<br /><br />

Under RIPA you could get 2 years in prison for not handing over decryption keys as part of a police investigation, if you &quot;forget&quot; your password and they don&#039;t believe you they can throw the book at you. So you&#039;ll hand over those keys because that caution for drugs is way less severe than the world of pain you&#039;ll face over encrypted files. That&#039;s why the SD card method is the best for us Brits, they have to not only prove that it exists but have it in their hand before they can strongarm us into releasing the keys. Good luck with that!<br /><br />As for getting busted, it&#039;s not illegal for you to be in receipt of illegal substances without your knowledge. Just use the name of someone who used to live at your address, and don&#039;t open the package until a couple of days after it has been delivered. Hell, even write &quot;not at this address&quot; on the envelope before you open it. If you get busted then don&#039;t admit to anything, play dumb and don&#039;t ever order drugs to that address again.

				It is, And the risk is minimal, but it is incriminating evidence to be in contact with someone talking about purchasing illegal drugs and &quot;conspiring&quot; to smuggle them internationally. so even when talking about making an order i would send it PGP encrypted. <br />Chances are they would try and bust the seller but they might just decide they want the buyer as well. There&#039;s plenty of noobs making orders and not encrypting things, so i suppose that&#039;l be food for Le for a while, but you need to be careful, you dont wanna get caught out.
