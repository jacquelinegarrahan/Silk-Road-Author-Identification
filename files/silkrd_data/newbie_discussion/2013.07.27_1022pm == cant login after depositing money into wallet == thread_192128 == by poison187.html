				hey man your post is a little vague can you give me some more details so i can attempt to help you out....im guessing your talking about SR wallet...remember it can take anywhere from 1-4 hrs for reflection and sometimes up to 10-12 hours....also SR has been slammed with alot of people so you are not the only one having problems logging in....now if you are talking about another website the only other wallet website i have heard that has been having issues is blockchain , but like i said im not really sure what wallet you are having problems with.

				ok im gunna try to figure this out with you as i am still a little vague...but i have notice sometimes SR loads and the captcha or w/e its called isnt right...it should be a word followed by letters....sometimes if the login screen comes up with the captcha in only numbers you need to reload the page....also try closing TOR and reopening it and maybe that will work...make sure you have the up to date TOR...i know some people use Tails , i dont so couldnt help ya there....but as long as you know the username....phrase...and type the letters in correctly you should have no issues....i have been getting on and off SR as we speak with no problems whatsoever! if you are really lost or confused .....send me a PM im here to help&nbsp; my friend
