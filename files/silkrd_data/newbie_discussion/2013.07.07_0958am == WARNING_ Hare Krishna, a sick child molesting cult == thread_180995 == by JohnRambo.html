				WARNING: Hare Krishna, a sick child molesting cult<br /><br />The Hare Krishna cult is a very dangerous child-molesting cult. Over 2,000 children were molested in the Hare Krishna cult, and hundreds of those children have committed suicide as a result of the psychological trauma.<br /><br />Here is a full list of the various tortures, as well as sexual molestation, that the children suffered:<br /><br />http://www.harekrsna.org/iskcon-child-abuse.htm<br /><br />Please keep your children far away from Hare Krishna temples, as they could be abducted and molested by Hare Krishna cult members. Here&#039;s a worldwide listing of Hare Krishna temples, check and see if they have a temple in your local hometown, and if so, please consider writing to your town council and requesting them to ban this criminal child molesting cult:<br /><br />Worldwide Hare Krishna Temple Directory:<br /><br />http://directory.krishna.com/<br /><br />Please pass on this message to as many people as possible. By doing so, you just might be saving a child&#039;s life from being molested by this cult. Please post it on your Facebook wall, send it to your local newspapers, please just spread the word. Parents need to know to keep their children away from areas that have Hare Krishna temples in them.<br />

				OMG.<br /><br />What a bunch of idiocies. Saying that the Hare-Krishna people in their totality are &quot;child-molesters&quot; would be the same exact thing as saying that all christians are child-molesters. While there are surely a lot of priest in christian churches that are pedophiles (much more than in other religions btw, if you want child-molesters you find there as many as you want), this doesn&#039;t mean that christianity as a &quot;cult&quot; is &quot;child-molesting&quot;. <br /><br />You have really no idea of what the hell you are talking about. I bet how much you want you don&#039;t either know who Krishna is and how the Hare-Krishna philosophy is born.<br /><br />In the same way I can bet that you are a fundamentalist catholic, isn&#039;t it? In that case, I already told you where to really look before you search outside.

				this day and age we must learn how to not be stereotypical and to differentiate between the people who do horrid things and people who are guilty by association . very seldom are groups like this evil as a whole its mostly a few members ruining it for the masses

				Generalizing is indeed not the way to go.<br />But keeping your head in the sands because there are some aspects alluring to their blablabla is just as dumb.<br /><br />Besides..they do sell alot of bullshit.<br /><br />Literally..they SELL it.<br />At least in our country they were at it again.<br />
