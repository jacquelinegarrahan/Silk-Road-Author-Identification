				http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/060713-bitcoin-atm-270602.html (clearnet)<br /><br />So I know there is a ton of &quot;how to be anonymous&quot; and &quot;purchase bitcoins anonymously&quot; and all that crap here.<br />correct me if i&quot;m wrong. my understanding is, bitcoins are anonymous in that they don&#039;t have your name or IP attacked to them. However they can be tracked back to origin and purchase points.&nbsp; Meaning that if I purchase coins with a CC or bank account then they can be tracked back and those coins can be associated with my purchase, thus making them useless for anonymity. This also means that even if I purchased coins in cash from someone else, if that someone else purchased with CC or bank acount then they could track back to that individual.&nbsp; This also means that any purchase that requires deed, receipt, title etc could have the coins tracked back to that point. <br /><br />So at this point the only truly safe anonymous way to buy coins is with cash, without ID, and to then purchase nothing from that wallet, but from a series of &quot;sub&quot; wallets, all while running vidalia and having your wallet anonymized? <br /><br />is all of this correct?

				You seem mostly right, but you can also mine coins (so long as the miner connects via tor) which would give you &#039;fresh&#039; coins which have never been associated with anything else or anyone. That&#039;s quite a technical jump for a few purchases though so maybe buying them from a miner then there&#039;s only one step from the original idea. <br /><br />Also if you use a washing service like I think blockchain.info used to offer then I think that muddles it all up quite a lot. As best if you used a washing service and someone tracked from say the CC you used to buy it they would be able to tell You bought BTC using your CC&gt;the BTC went to your wallet&gt;it then went to another wallet (bitcoinfog) and from there while they could track parts of the original coin they wouldn&#039;t be able to tell what you did after that as the washing service sends you parts of coins not associated with your own input.

				Thanks man, appreciate that info.<br /><br />Follow up question<br /><br />If you were to receive say 10 transactions of .1 btc from 10 separate wallets (as long as this is done smartly) then that amounts to 1btc. this 1 btc can&#039;t be tracked back as it was put together through fractions? I mean that the smaller .1 transactions can be tracked but they for a &quot;new&quot; bitcoin in essence? then this new coin could be spent in fractions as well? this is in essence how tumbling works ? many coins are thrown into one giant pool, fractions are moved about, rejoined, broken and moved again then eventually some coins are sent to exit wallets and then from the exit wallets in whatever portions, across different time periods, and eventually the person has their coins back.<br /><br />As long as this process is done with &quot;anonymous&quot; function clicked (i can&#039;t remember the exact details but something along the lines of proxy IP 127.0.0.1 sock 9050 etcetc) then this should completely make them anonymous ? The larger the pool the more anonymous it is?<br /><br />Does this mean that your ip is somehow attached to your wallet if you aren&#039;t using the above function?
