				Well - I can tell you when I know I&#039;m stoned (I already know I&#039;m a stoner). My criteria for being really good and stoned is when I&#039;m going somewhere and I have no clue whatsoever how to get to where I&#039;m going or where I am. Totally lost, although it&#039;s just a short term lost since I still manage to get to whereever I&#039;m headed. It&#039;s just that I have no clue each step of the way where I really am or where I need to head next. It&#039;s a cool sensation and, for me, defines the border between buzzed and FUCKED UP.
