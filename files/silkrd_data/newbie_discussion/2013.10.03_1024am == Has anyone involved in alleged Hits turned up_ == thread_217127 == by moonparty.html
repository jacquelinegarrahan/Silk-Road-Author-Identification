				Does anyone remember having any dealings with anyone mentioned as part of these alleged hits?<br /><br />Was FriendlyChemist a real seller? Ever on the forums? What about their supposed supplier?<br /><br />What about the supposed bust that lead to the alleged hit for 80k? Did that bust make the news here on the forums? Did anyone ever say after the bust, &quot;oh the guy involved in that was pinched&quot;? The way the story is told, it makes it sound like that person would have been a SR vendor also. <br /><br />It seems like the community would have noticed if vendors would have started to turn up dead. <br /><br />Neither story about these hits sounds right. <br />

				I would also like to see some confirmation that this &#039;FriendlyChemist&#039; ever existed, on SR at least considering that Canadian LE seem to believe that the person whose name was given to the &#039;hitman&#039; did not exist.
