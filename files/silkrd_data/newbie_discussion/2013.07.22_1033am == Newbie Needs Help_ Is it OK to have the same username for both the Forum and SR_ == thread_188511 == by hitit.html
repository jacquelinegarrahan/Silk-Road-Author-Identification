				Sure its okay, but then anything you say here can be used against you on the Road. It is not necessary to have both the same unless you are a vendor and would like access to the roundtable. I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re not, because you asked this. <br /><br />I would say a lot of people have a different username and password for both<br /><br />(here&#039;s a hint; mine are wildly different ;D)

				I&#039;m new as well and I used the same name for both. I think it&#039;s better to do that if you intend on being an honest and just person. Credibility is huge on underground markets so it&#039;s much more important to be a good person instead of saying you&#039;re a good person. -IMO

				Keep them together if you&#039;re a vendor.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a buyer, it couldn&#039;t hurt and does establish credibility as others have said. You could also maybe contact SR support in a pinch about a forum thing, e.g. password recovery, if it was clear that the forum account was associated with your road account...

				There shouldnt be a problem using same username,i dont see anyway it can harm you unless you spam or do something similiar to that.<br />It&#039;s much more recommanded to vendors,but its ok even if you are just a buyer.

				Thanks for the help everyone! It seems that it&#039;s not too much of an issue but for the extra cautious it&#039;s probably a good idea to keep them separate..<br /><br />Thanks again - there&#039;s definitely a great sense of community on these forums&nbsp; :D
