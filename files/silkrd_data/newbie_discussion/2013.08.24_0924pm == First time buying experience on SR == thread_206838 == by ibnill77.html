				Last Monday I placed 3 orders with 3 vendors, my first purchases on SR. All orders went off without a hitch and each arrived safely. I was a little nervous but given the nature of the orders and the fact that all were domestic, I maintained confidence. Now they are all here I thought I&#039;d share my experience. Note I have yet to try any of the items but am hoping to do so this weekend. Here&#039;s the breakdown:<br /><br />- 1/4 oz P. Cubensis from MushroomGirl - Arrived stealthily via Priority mail in 2 full days. Looks very good. Vendor even sent a thank you message. <br /><br />- 1 oz P. Galindoi from USAShroomz - Arrived in 2 days via Priority mail, also very stealthy. Like MG&#039;s order, I laughed a bit at the packaging. This vendor had a free giveaway at the time which I also received (1/2 oz of the same that was stated as a weaker product because of over drying). <br /><br />- 3 hits Fluff LSD (120 Âµg) from silo - took a bit longer, 4 full days, as this vendor uses standard mail. Stealth was good and the product looks right on.<br /><br />Next step, try this stuff out and spread the word.<br />

				Congrats on the positive experience so far.&nbsp; I ordered from USAShroomz also and took 7g of the lower potency mixed in chocolate earlier today.&nbsp; It feels just like the truffles in Amsterdam; makes everything more colorful and fascinating.. very nice!&nbsp; I had to gradually ramp up the dose since I wasn&#039;t sure how strong it would be and it had been a few years since I had them last.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got an order for some lucy as well, not from Silo, but I&#039;m interested to hear how those are.&nbsp; Made me sad to read how somehow one of his 50 packs bled out into the envelope.. that sucks! :(&nbsp; Seems like a reputable vendor nonetheless.

				I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;re liking the road, it really is a great thing, however there&#039;s one thing with the post you might want to be careful of. Multiple packages are very suspicious, it&#039;s best that you try and space them out over a week or two :)

				I get packages like crazy, but I receive them at my office. I started a research and development company for this.
