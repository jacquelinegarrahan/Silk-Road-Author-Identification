				Less than a month on SR and have made 4 purchases, all successful. On the last the product was sub par. I didnt ask for a refund as I received the product, it was just shite. I left feedback about how the order was fine but the item received was sub par. When I looked at the feedback on the items page it was taking up the space of 5 feedback, therefore 4 other peoples feedback was pushed over to the 2nd page of feedback. Should I edit it down to 2-3 lines.

				Just write what you&#039;d want other people to know about the vendor&#039;s product, but don&#039;t give out too much information on the details of the packaging.<br /><br />Be clear, but concise

				this is the feedback. <br /><br />FE. So far comms response time is above and beyond. Will update on receipt of order.<br />Update:<br />Item received 13 days after order. For distance this timeframe is average. Had quicker but cannot fault vendor on this. Top marks.<br />Stealth is average with nothing more than standard practice but, again, unable to fault vendor. The item arrived @ destination with no problems whatsoever. Full marks.<br />Quality. This is the point the vendor harms his near perfect business practice. For this price Im sure no customer is expecting rocks chipped straight off the kilo. I thought wow, cant be the best gear but even if I get 2 - 3 tickles then I would be a happy camper. I think 0.3 to a halfweight in 1 shot is reasonably large, even for a substantial habit. Over a 20 min period I IVed 3 progressively larger shots and got nothing more than a mediocre glow after the last. No more than I would have felt off a 10ml Xanax. No taste. No pins and needles. Substantially less effect than desired. Even for this price. Nil marks.<br />&quot;You get what u pay for&quot;, I hear you all sighing with a knowing smirk, and while I do agree I dont feel 2 or 3 tickles from 1g, no matter the price, is an overestimation.<br />At the same time, I do believe the vendor to be a good one. This is my first transaction with him and I did receive product. His communication was superb. I have not complained and do not intend to as I feel one low quality batch should not make or break a vendor. I will suggest he uses some new testers though, if he uses them at all.<br />I cannot summarize as the two parts of the transaction were night and day. Comms, shipping and timeline were above average. Quality of item sub par. I will try another batch but expect a scathing review if product is of similar quality.

				That&#039;s fine as is - it&#039;ll help others to decide whether to use that vendor themselves, and you don&#039;t reveal anything that might reveal the vendor&#039;s security practices etc. All good!<br /><br />Libertas
