				I am wondering if anyone on here sells some that is worth taking. I do not want to be giggle and be happy I want to fry my brain see the world melt before my eyes. talk to gremlins and leprechauns fuck even santa. All I can find in the sellers is 150ug and the avengers thread none really promising with most off by 10-25ug so you would need 3 100ug tabs to even really start to trip.I am asking instead of searching also because I am a newbie and need to get to 50. So go a head and spam away yourself. But if anyone who knows a seller that has decent product for a decent price feel free to let me know. I mean $10- $15 or more for 80-90ug is a rip off in my book. Its like going to a hooker and paying full price for a fuck and getting a hand job.

				I do not know about a bad trip I have only had one ever that&#039;s when I met Jesus. And that was caused by a movie we all watched. LSD just really seems low quality for for more $. Last time I had any good shit was at the last GD concert in Chicago the day or two before Jerry died. Shit after that it only came around every once and a while with the fish but its been down hill to dead.

				Yeah, you are looking at the wrong drug if you want those results.&nbsp; Nevertheless I highly suggest Tesselated&#039;s LSD at 200ug at about $13/per hit.<br /><br />And I am not confident that 25I is for me given it&#039;s length of exposure to humans.&nbsp; You want elves?&nbsp; DMT!!!!<br /><br />blahblah1234

I dropped once at the beginning of school one day only to have to run out and ditch after three periods because it was so intense. The DMT that shit makes me sick plus that the shit you see people on were they look retarded because they are so fucked up im just glad cell phone cameras at the time were far and few. Id probably be or been a hit or what ever you call it when shit goes viral cause I felt I looked retarded like I had a stroke and walked like Frankenstein. Only good thing I remember was the come down because I had finally felt in control.&nbsp; As far as the other ones I am not really into trying out I am older now and it is easier to stick to what you know.

				hopskiptrip, I know exactly what your talking about.&nbsp; The first time i tried acid i got shit from this dude i know thats in his early 30s.&nbsp; I saw all kinds of creatures that were playing with me, and playing tricks, and shit I tripped for 16 hours at a 3 day music festival and for 16 hours i could not speak english and I legit went to Mars.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; Then the dude got liquid shit for EDC ny last year and holy shit that trip wasnt as intense but it was AMAZING! Didnt make me feel gitty or anything it waas very very visual.&nbsp; I want to find LSD like that but shit here seems expensive... and I dont want to play the guess and chose game cuz i dont wanna waste trips on shitty lsd. let me know if you find anything<br /><br />Ive also tried 25i, its a different trip, more intense but not the same.&nbsp; Feels more industrial if that makes any sense.

				25c in my opinion is a less intense version of 25i. It starts out pretty intense, and its very visual but after about 1-2 hrs you start feeling kinda gitty still with good visuals.&nbsp; I personally like 25d then 25i then 25c, in that order, those are the only 3 i tried so far

				You want to get that far gone, try 1200+ 25I nbome, done alot of acid in the day and apart from being out on the ledge, the only time i really fukin loved it was when i was coked up through out the trip. Had that kind of vibe with the 25I nbome, that shit will get you there and keep you there for 5/6 hours or more a lot more. The other place to go is drop into the ketamine reallity, not so long a trip but fukin history lessons about the slime we came from and the slime where we will return. Plus you can sometimes ask that being thingy a couple of questions if you can remember who or what you are.

				&nbsp;I&#039;m older too and used to roam the lot at GD concerts. My estimate is all that white blotter, dancing bears ect. from that era were about 50-60ug. About 3-4 years ago I found acid again after like a 5 year break. I freaked on the price $10 a hit! It was liquid. But I have to admit it was stronger than the stuff from the 90&#039;s. Probably 100ug&#039;s per drop.&nbsp; I did 5 my first time after that long break and that was one of my best trips. <br />&nbsp;But still, i&#039;m used to buying sheets for less than $150, selling most and tripping for free.&nbsp; Oh yeah.

				Thanks everyone for your reply&#039;s I am just doing the waiting game. I will will give a review on how it goes. Guess I am just getting old and think it crazy about the high price low ug. You know back when I was younger it was $10 at the most. It might be time I start talking about the walk to school up hill both ways and other shitty stories.

				LSD isn&#039;t the drug to see leprechauns and shit on, if you REALLY REALLY want to trip hard do DMT.<br />TESSELATED is pro 5 200 microgram tabs for like 2.70 bitcoins (like 80 bucks) <br />LSD is amazing, give it a try :) but to trip like crazy, do dmt, or a delirium like datura on the delirium you will have full blown hullcionations and you wont be able to tell the difference between what&#039;s real and what isnt, i suppose you could see leprechauns on it :)
