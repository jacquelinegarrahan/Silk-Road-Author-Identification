				i smoke every day of my life, when i wake up, when it wears off i smoke again all the way until i go to bed. the only time i am not high is when i am asleep. i have recently been &quot;forced&quot; to take a break for money reasons. we all know this sucks. i am 10 days dry, and i thought it would be getting easier by now. at least i can eat and sleep now, but everything is still so dull and i want to get high. so any suggestions on how to pass the time? i cant do any other drugs of course, because of the money issue. otherwise i would have gotten a bottle and some benzos haha.

				I don&#039;t know what kind of person you are, but once I start smoking all day errday I become the most unmotivated lethargic fuck out there.&nbsp; When quitting, I find any prolonged physical activity really helps.&nbsp; Makes you feel rejuvenated in a way. Clear headspace, no loss of motivation (or at least as much) and I just feel better overall

				Definitely start exercising! Take up running, riding, swimming or a team sport. It will take your mind off not being able to smoke, and it will promote excellent health and well-being!<br /><br />I hope your money situation gets better :)<br /><br />&lt;3 Rose &lt;3

				You don&#039;t need &quot;money&quot; to smoke weed man. When you&#039;re a heavy pot smoker, usually you have other heavy pot smoking friends. And if they are indeed &quot;friends&quot; and not, what i call, &quot;pretends.&quot; They would smoke you up most of the time for something in return. Maybe make them some food in exchange for a smoke down (everybody benefits in this situation haha), do them a favor of some sorts, trade them a few cigarettes (if they smoke them), get them drunk.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m like you bro, pot is basically my coffee, my alchohol, fuck its my snack sometimes when I&#039;m hungry (I don&#039;t eat it, just instead of eating i&#039;ll toke).&nbsp; The only way to I&#039;ve been able to keep up smoking so much being middle class is to start growing it myself, really is the only way for heavy smokers.&nbsp; &nbsp;I still have to buy every now and then but once you have everything set up the costs are very low.

				Just grit your teeth and bear it. Try to think of how much higher you&#039;ll get the next time you do smoke. Enjoy those dreams you have every night where you somehow come into possession of a fat sack. And try to be thankful that at least your withdrawal isn&#039;t from benzos or the like.

				Yeah most heavy smokers are a lil too baked to do anything but be baked.&nbsp; I can relate but I dunno since I was like 14 it was the only thing thats kept me um...not sure how to say it, my friends say it &quot;evens me out&quot; lol, still don&#039;t really know what it means but I wouldn&#039;t want to go a day without it.

				Hey, I recently gave up for three months. My head was clearer , I got more done , my girlfriend was very happy and I felt like a new man. My Asthma improved as&nbsp; well. That&#039;s not to say I didn&#039;t miss it but you have to remember the good things about stopping. Good luck

				be happy that you&#039;re a pot smoker and can give it up when needed without having to go through serious physical withdrawal.&nbsp; One of the most outstanding features of weed, IMO.

				Sucks to stop, I have to take sleeping pills, or drink beer which i hate doing in place of weed or even pop a few pain pills - but those cause bad WD and can get expensive. BUT quitting weed for awhile does make the next time sooo much better, its like that dreamy state that makes you all crazed out by everything. Its awesome! <br /><br />In the mean time, since other drugs are out of the question and sobriety need to be your friend, I would suggest being physically active as your best bet. Go for a brisk walk/run and do some push ups and sit ups. Sweat the boredom out. Keep your girlfriend or likewise nearby to keep your brain in order and also to take stress out with sex. Laugh really hard at shit. Look up funny jokes - it sucks to read but read a funny, long ass joke and about half way through you will be so into it and then when the punchline comes you will be laughing your dick off and feeling great! Play guitar, punch a hole in the wall, bake a cake and put crazy candy like a snickers bar in the middle with rolos on top. Climb a tree or float down a river if its warm. Take a big dinner table you might not need and throw it down a hill throw a huge desk down it throw a whole bookcase down the hill and just watch it be DESTROYED it is so funny to watch. Roll down the hill. Play with electricity. make prank phone calls, Set that teddy bear your bitch ex-gf gave you on fire set a old TV set on fire set an entire collection of golf balls on fire it will cause crazy CHAOS it is so much fun tap into your inner child and&nbsp; do all that crazy shit you use to as a kid. Just stay out of trouble. Have a polite day.

				Do you have cats? If so, smoke a little catnip and see how relaxing it is. It&#039;s perfectly safe and a great way to chill out and forget about bud withdrawals. <br /><br />I find that the mere actions of smoking soothes the nerves.<br /><br />Good luck and best wishes man!
