				Well, since I can&#039;t post on the big forums yet since I lost my last password for my veteran account -.-, I decided why not help out the new folk getting their BC safely to the road.<br /><br />Having done many transactions for MP to BC, I can safely rate some of the vendors who do this.<br /><br />Let&#039;s cut to the chase!<br /><br />Vicious86 has filled one of my orders previously. It was about a 200-300$ MP (can&#039;t remember exactly) and it was filled in about 4-5 hours! AND AT AN 8% Rating! Incredible!<br /><br />I highly recommend him for any of you MP to BC needs (REloadit too!)<br /><br />As for communication, when vicious reports being at his &quot;desk&quot; so to speak, he fields messages and replies faster than most vendors I&#039;ve seen! He is also polite enough to let users know when they are CLOSED. For example, sometimes vicious closes on weekends, but he posts on his profile he can&#039;t field messages. I LOVE when vendors do this so I know not to sit around waiting for something for an undetermined amount of time!<br /><br />Seriously the best MP to BC vendor I&#039;ve seen!!!<br /><br />Other MP to BC vendors I trust: Sugar Mama (Out of business), SmartCoin (Best rates, sometimes delays), Freemoney (don&#039;t be fooled by his low rating! Someone dicked him over).<br /><br />I&#039;d feel safe getting from any of the above vendors - but hit up vicious86 if you can. Truly a great soul to work with on the road!
