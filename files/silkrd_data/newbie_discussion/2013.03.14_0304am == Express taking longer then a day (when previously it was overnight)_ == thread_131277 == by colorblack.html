				So, although I&#039;m relatively new to the road.. I&#039;ve had 2 successful transactions (same vendor). Both time packages arrived the next day (this is from one of side of the US to the other). Even during the &quot;snow storm&quot;. Now, I placed a new order on Monday (and was told it would ship the next day.. which is standard procedure with this reliable vendor). Marked in transit Tuesday. Nothing came today (Wednesday). Is this normal? I thought Express practically gauranteed next day delivery (that&#039;s what we&#039;re paying for, right?!).<br /><br />I contacted the vendor who said he will look up the tracking # and get to the bottom of this. He also explained it&#039;s possible its just taking an extra day, or his couriers were late with the cuttoff time. Anyways, should know in a couple of hours when he checks out the tracking.<br /><br />Does anyone have any experience with Express NOT being overnight? Should I be concerned (fuck, I&#039;m new to all of this, and obviously still in super paranoid mode).?

				USPS no longer guarantees overnight service on Express mail, even if you meet the cutoff time for that location. Depending on where you are and where you are sending it can be overnight or 2 days. If you take an Express mail shipment to a retail USPS counter, they can tell the shipper the expected delivery date and time. But again, that is if you take it to a post office and talk to process it over the counter.

				Update: The mail comes in about 45 minutes.. so I should know if it arrives today.<br /><br />Pm&#039;d back and forth with the vendor last night who looked up the tracking and said it looks like there was a delay as it showed the package still in the original state hub (could be a delay because of the aircract having an issue or something) and that I should see it today. So either his courier got it to the PO past the cutoff, or just some normal delay. I guess no biggie.. you guys all seem to feel that Express can easily take 2 days (OR MORE). Will know for certain within the hour.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s weird how the human mind works. A day or two can go by fast.. but the last half hour or so before the mail comes its as if you have entered some alternate reality where time literally moves 4x slower hahaha.

				Update: It arrived. Moral of the story.. Express Mail is not overnight. Second moral of the story: one needs to chill the fuck out if they want any kind of relaxed experienced as a traveler of the Road.

				I hear you man! I just had my 3rd transaction. Now imagine the 1st... I had visions of all kinds of shit happening. SWAT team dressed as mailmen shooting teargas through my windows.. the neighborhood being sealed off by the feds and a controlled delivery being attempted, getting a knock on the door by the DEA.. the scenarios kept getting more and more outrageous until the mailman arrived as usual around 3:30pm.. put my mail in the mailbox, waved.. and drove that cute little mail-mobile to the next house. And opening that package to find goodies I felt like I was in the fucking Matrix or something. I thought &quot;fuck, this is for real&quot;. Will never forget that day.

				Just because you order express doesn&#039;t mean the vendor get&#039;s to the post office in an express manner :) You know? You can order Express.. and if it takes the vendor 1-2 days to put it in transit, and then express could take 2 days (they no longer gaurantee overnight. in fact, i&#039;ve had them come overnight, and i&#039;ve had them come in 2 days).. so by the time it reaches you, it could be 4 or 5 days later. Yes, that&#039;s unlikely.. but depends on your vendors turnaround schedule and what cutoff of what day he makes the drop, and then USPS saying it could take 2 days (i&#039;ve heard of it taking 3!). In all honesty, priority has never NOT reached me in 2 days from when it&#039;s shipped. Ordered Friday, shipped Saturday, arrived Sunday.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ordered Monday, shipped monday, arrived wednesday. Think about that. Priority just makes more sense on so many levels. Plan ahead a few days. I always factor in the weekend and the turnaround time of individual vendors when making orders. On the other hand, I&#039;ve ordered on a Tuesday evening and had my package in hand at 10AM the next morning with Express, and truth is though .. that&#039;s a fucking lovely feeling.

However, I&#039;m considering charging a significant processing fee and guaranteeing same day shipping for people who need it right away, though I&#039;m not sure how much demand there would be for such a service (I&#039;m thinking like an additional $20-25 fee on top of postage). <br /><br />@ your original question, the first time I ever sent something Express, it took 2 days (I felt terrible about it too; I had given the customer a free upgrade due to already being 1 day late). Since then I haven&#039;t even offered Express (and very few customers ask for it). Considering how common it is for Priority to arrive in 2, it seems pretty pointless unless you&#039;re about to start withdrawing if you don&#039;t get something right away.
