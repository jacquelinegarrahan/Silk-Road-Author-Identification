				I you have to mail from a PO, I think you have to for express but not sure. Or if it&#039;s a package to large for the blue boxes, what about your fingerprints on it? I was thinking maybe some super glue on my finger tips. Let it harden first of course. Is there any way to mail express from a blue box if it&#039;s small enough?

				Interesting.&nbsp; I never thought about that but I think they could do it.&nbsp; I think one of the most common ways they can pull fingerprints is if you use tape and your finger gets pressed against the tape when you rip it.&nbsp; I know that leaves an almost perfect impression of your finger print.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they can pull prints off of cardboard boxes though.<br /><br />I wonder if the PO purposely uses slick cardboard on their express for that reason.&nbsp; Just a thought.

				for your information, they can pull fingerprints even more paper, ie letters, money...etc you get the idea. one of the few things they cant pull fingerprints is cling film,

Once they&#039;re packed, the courier (wearing gloves) puts them in their bag, and off they go. Blue box. But, in instances where one ABSOLUTELY has to go into a post office... we use fast-dry glue. Essentially the same thing as liquid bandaid. just keep some plate glass near by to get a nice smooth edge(rolling tips). Viola.<br /><br />Thanks for reiterating this. I wasn&#039;t laughing you.

				I use my motorcycle gloves but&nbsp; it was pouring the one day and I HAD to go into the post office so I put a bit of super glue on my tips. The liquid band aid is a great idea though, thanks guys. Super glue is harder to get off but it worked. You don&#039;t need to cover your whole finger in the shit, just enough to obscure a print. Also, I don&#039;t think worrying about prints is paranoid, especially when you know your prints are on file, i.e. military or criminal record. <br /><br />With the news about the NSA recently, I don&#039;t think you can be too paranoid. I always knew they were doing this shit to us but maybe now not so many people will think you&#039;re crazy for telling them that. Some people only believe shit when they see it on the news, which is a shame because most of &quot;news&quot; is bullshit. <br /><br />Just be safe guys and remember, they&#039;rrrrrre watching you. ;)
