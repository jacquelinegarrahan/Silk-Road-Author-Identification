				It&#039;s happened with a few vendors. Cashing out of the business. One Aussie vendor had a valentines day sale with huge discounts on the condition of FE then he fucked off with god knows how much coin.

				just out of curiosity, when these sorts of scams have occured in the past, is the seller reputable from having already fulfilled many orders?? or do some scammers do these FE scams right after opening their account? i&#039;m thinking it&#039;s the former since i presume the price of seller accounts is higher than the amount the swindlers would net. but i&#039;m asking anyway because i want to know as much as i can about these FE scams. thanks,<br /><br />-soberman<br /><br />

Because they&#039;ll be concerned with their rep. The longer a seller is around, the high the possibility that they&#039;re about to get out.
