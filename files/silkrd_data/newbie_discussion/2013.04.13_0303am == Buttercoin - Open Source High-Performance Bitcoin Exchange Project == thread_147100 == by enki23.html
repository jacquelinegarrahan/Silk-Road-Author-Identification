				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m a computer security and distributed systems guy. I&#039;ve did audits and trainings at many large banks and lotteries and also built complicated stuff like a quantum cryptography engine and a p2p file sync engine. I also worked at TradeHill for 3 months in 2011. You can learn more about me here http://paulbohm.com/about/<br /><br />You may also know me from a Bitcoin article I wrote two years ago that&#039;s popular on Quora: http://www.quora.com/Bitcoin/Is-the-cryptocurrency-Bitcoin-a-good-idea<br /><br />I&#039;m really annoyed at the exchange software quality and yesterday spontaneously tweeted that I&#039;d start working on an open-source high-performance highly-secure exchange engine and asked if anyone wants to join me in my San Francisco apartment.<br /><br />Seven people showed up, including a Stanford professor, someone who built an ISP, someone who previously built a payment system and an angel investor. They all were tremendous help in nailing down the core architecture. Later today another friend will come by who is an expert in B-tree filesystem design, which will help with getting the data structures right.<br /><br />I&#039;m doing some explorative coding at http://github.com/buttercoin/buttercoin and note-taking at http://buttercoin.hackpad.com/ but it&#039;s really just a rough outline right now.<br /><br />Basically I want to build something similar to the LMAX architecture (http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html), in node.js and put it under an MIT license. If this worked it should allow us to process enormous amounts of transaction, or even do things that help distribute exchange more.<br /><br />Let me know if any of you are interested in joining a hipchat or hackpad and discussing the design, or contributing on github.<br /><br />I can&#039;t promise this will succeed - before yesterday I had no plans or ambition to write an exchange, but I really want Bitcoin to succeed and I don&#039;t think it can without a quality opensource exchange package.<br /><br />You can email me at enki@bbq.io or if you want to motivate me send donations to 1AQhrfziGW8ozahK8zNDG3ydxeeE4UHewx (i will donate any funds received to the bitcoin foundation should I not succeed at building buttercoin).<br /><br />Any thoughts? I&#039;d love to hear it!<br /><br />Ok IRC here: irc.freenode.net #buttercoin subreddit: r/buttercoin<br /><br />leave your email on http://buttercoin.launchrock.com if you want to help out - we might ask for help via email later<br />

				This posting is a scam. Note that the bitcoin address the OP indicated for donations has changed.<br /><br />Sources:<br />Original reddit post in the clearnet: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c7v6z/buttercoin_open_source_highperformance_bitcoin/<br />Other places in the clearnet this scam posting appeared: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c9vbj/beware_of_the_buttercoin_scam/<br /><br />I suggest for a moderator to remove the donation address as fraud is against the terms of service of this forum.
