				I havn&#039;t been on SR in a long time and lost both my SR account and forum account. But now I&#039;m unable to post. I&#039;m a US domestic supplier of GHB and can supply virtually unlimited quantity. For much better prices then other vendors. So i&#039;m going to setup a seller account but would like to post in the offers section to see if there is a high demand on SR for G as well as possibly offer samples.

				Hey there! I am very excited at the prospect of having a reasonably priced ghb vendor here in the us!! I think you would make a ton of business due to there not being any good vendors in the us right now. Please pm me if you decide to send samples for reviews. Thanks

At least that&#039;s what it was marketed as online after GHB was outlawed... Now all GHB precursors are banned. GBL is nasty shit. I feel bad for anyone who has to drink GBL because they do not have access to GHB. If you put it in a water bottle it will eat right through the plastic (depending on the type of plastic container)

It&#039;s similar to alcohol without the craziness/emotions/smell. Also, one benefit is it&#039;s nearly impossible to detect in drug tests besides hair follicle I believe but even then, they have to be looking for it. It gives a strong feeling of euphoria, it makes men/woman extremely horny and great sex, lowers inhibitions. With G you must be careful though and dose it properly. There is a thin line between good dose and taking too much. When you take too much you &quot;g out&quot; and fall asleep and/or act like and idiot if your in public. The good thing is it has a short half life, so if you do take too much you won&#039;t be in that state of mind for long.
