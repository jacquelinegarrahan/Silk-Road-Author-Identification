				Yeah the high kicks ass. Super fun, talkative, feel awesome.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />The comedown on coke with inactive cuts isn&#039;t quite sooo bad, but you still wanna redose like a motherfucker.&nbsp; :P

				Give it a try or two - you will not be addicted and probably wonder what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />It&#039;s not actually a super-strong drug - you can function in public, although I wouldn&#039;t recommend doing a big rail of it right before a job interview. <br /><br />The addictive qualities are subtle and over many months of use - it can definitely hook you, and potentially destroy your life in some cases, but it&#039;s more of a stealth attack where you barely notice it getting slightly stronger over an extended period of use. This can be very dangerous, but you won&#039;t wake up the day after your first try saying &quot;I gotta get me some more of that!&quot;.

				i wouldnt be too worried about getting addicted. i think you would have to use it regularly and really like the feeling. i never really understood people becoming addicted to cocaine. try doing junk for a week or 2 straight and then stopping and you will know about addiction lol&nbsp; ;)

				It&#039;s well worth it to do the research, and pay the price if it&#039;s more and find yourself as pure a product as you can find. The difference in quality of high , and the difference between a nice easy comfy comedown and feeling like shit after can be amazing with real good clean C.

				Meth is gross. Do not try meth... They call meth poormans coke around here... This place is flooded with the crap. <br /><br />Quality coke can&#039;t be beat... Wonderful euphoric high without a comedown.. Smoking it is pretty sweet.. couple large tokes for a nice rush an hour before bed with some short acting benzo&#039;s :)

				If you&#039;re looking for a straight-up stimulant Coke is the place to go, great buzz and body vibe and good talkative drug. Much better than Speed or Mephedrone and not as dangerous as Meth. Its expensive, but don&#039;t buy the cheap stuff on here, its better to buy a gram of 90% coke for £100, than buy some 30% shit for £50.

				You&#039;re not going to get addicted to cocaine if you only use it a little. It&#039;s a psychological addiction anyway, not physical.<br /><br />Cocaine is the bees knees. Some of the blow you can get on the road is fantastic. It really is one of my favorite drugs. Just do a fat line of some fishscale blow and tell me it doesn&#039;t knock you off your rocker.

				Definitely agree on the addiction thing as all psychological. Trying it will not cause you to be instantly addicted. Get the high grade and have fun :D

				When smoking the stuff the addiction only lasts as long as the buzz imo... <br /><br />I smoke maybe once or twice a month with a friend...

				Your better quality blow is gonna come from vendors who have weight but offer small sample size amounts as a trial run.&nbsp; Been there, done that.
