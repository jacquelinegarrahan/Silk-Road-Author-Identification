				Ok, guys.<br /><br />Something really basic, surprised me that there was no thread where it was mentioned (at least didnt find one).<br />So.. I fucked up big time and missed a number in my address, leading it to a totally different building. The packages haven&#039;t arrived yet, but i&#039;m really worried as to what will happen. Will they get returned to the vendor (and do i get a refund for that) or will they keep them in the post and how dangerous is it to take them from there. Is there any way to still get them?<br />I guess they can&#039;t be linked to me also.<br />First-time buyer, I acknowledge how much of a retard i am, but i need it explained to make sure i don&#039;t do the same mistake again.

				If the other address is valid, it will be delivered there. If the address is not valid it would go back to the sender BUT the sender should not have put his address on it if they were being serious about their safety. More likely than not, you are SOL.

				Thanks for the clarification, it seems dangerous to try and talk to the people that live on that address, considering they might open the package or something. Will probably just finalize and suck it up.

				what name is it on it? if its yours, then you could tell them what you did (regarding making a mistake). If theres a fake name/not your name, then yeah ... cop it on the chin and learn to triple check your address next time.

				How do you miss a number in your address? I mean, I probably would not have posted on this shit if I would have done it. Better luck next time?

				tell the vendor what you did... you never know the vendor may be nice and resend it to keep you as a customer.

				Do you know if the vendor shipped yet? If not just send the correct address to the seller. Worth checking.<br /><br />If it has your name on it your mail man might still deliver it to you since it is the same complex. It&#039;s a small chance but you never. I suppose it couldn&#039;t hurt to ask the neighbor for it. Just say you got something on eBay and noticed the address is wrong. If it has your name on it they shouldn&#039;t open it. <br /><br />It is definitely not the vendors fault. He is entitled to the funds so yea you might as well free the money. <br /><br />I hope it works out for you.
