				hey fellas .&nbsp; Just wondering what&nbsp; are you guys paying $&nbsp; in your area for what ever drug of choice is yours ,<br /><br />Im here some where in the USA -&nbsp; ive seen ridiculous&nbsp; prices on here for cocaine and weed , id be better off&nbsp; buying cocaine and weed off the street than ordering from here ,&nbsp; im paying 800$ a ounce for some pretty good fish scale&nbsp; &nbsp;. ive seen prices way over that&nbsp; per oz&nbsp; on here - same thing goes for weed ,&nbsp; i can get&nbsp; oz of top notch quality OZ&nbsp; for NO more than 200$&nbsp; a OZ - i feel bad for the people paying 300$ and up&nbsp; :(<br /><br />BUT - on the other hand&nbsp; im on a hunt for that MOLLY girl , cant seem to find a consistent connect&nbsp; over my way&nbsp; when it comes to those sexy gold shards .. when i do find her , dealers want around 125$- $150$ USD a gram ! and that is just ridiculous . ( hence&nbsp; is why im now here )&nbsp; &nbsp;I plan to find the connect for it , as like Ive stated im on the hunt for her ,and if she comes cheap enough i will be able to&nbsp; get rid of her no problem <br /><br />So with that being said - what are you guys paying on the street for your drugs , and is it worth coming on here to find it, if you cant find what your thirsty for around the corner . This is just out of my curiosity

				ya im&nbsp; seeing alot of that around here as well ,it&#039;s hard to find clean gold mdma shards for a fair price ...&nbsp; as of shrooms . well i grow them . i sell em on the &quot;street &quot;&nbsp; for 125$ 150$ a oz depending on if its a good friend or if it&#039;s a friend of a friend .&nbsp; and as of weed , we all have our med cards , so finding good cheap weed is never a problem , just stop at the dispensary

				IMHO quality is king. It is not only about how good and clean your high is. But being able to provide THE cleanest product, to surden people iRL. Can open doors.<br /><br />And those SUPER clean products can be hard to find consistantly iRL. So I value SR a great deal.
