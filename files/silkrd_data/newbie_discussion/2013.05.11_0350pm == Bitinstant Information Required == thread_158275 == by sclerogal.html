				Using Bitinstant it states you need to use your real name? Is this true?&nbsp; If your doing a transfer to email I know your required to provide a real (tormail.org) email address. How can you get away with providing a fictitious name when your on the &quot;red&quot; phone and they attempt to pull up real information?&nbsp; &nbsp;Also can that information be traced to purchasing Bitcoins when making a bill payment to ZipZap?&nbsp; Am I missing something here?&nbsp; Forgive me, I am a super newbie. Thank for being kind in advanced.

				Just use a fake name and you&#039;ll be fine. And never use MtGox! What&#039;s the &quot;red phone&quot; though?

				In Walmart and CVS you need to purchase the moneygram to pay the ZipZap Bill, you use the &quot;red&quot; phone to call in the payment right there.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually located in the customer service area of the store, next to where the moneygram is purchased.&nbsp; It&#039;s often referred to the &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; phone.

				They don&#039;t ask for an ID so you just give your fake information. But bitinstant is a bit of a hassle...

				&nbsp;How do I get around when on the red phone they ask you for your name, address, and phone number.&nbsp; It&#039;s verified in a database if it exists or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, if I did give them my real information (moneygram and bitinstant) is that traceable?

				If you give them your real information it&#039;s traceable... I didn&#039;t know they actually verified the information in a database. From what I&#039;ve read about bitinstant is that you can just use some fake information. Maybe you should try to look in the security subforum... Or try to get them from localbitcoins.com

				Hey i just ordered through bitinstant yesterday. The first time i tried to use bitinstant I did it through CVS and they asked me for my ID as I was paying them. I was pulling out 700$ in cash out of my wallet when the guy behind the register asked to see my ID. I look at him and say, &quot;What? why? why do you need to see it?&quot; very sly on my part. He gave me a weird look and told me it was protocol. So again very slyly I tell him &quot;Oh whoops i forgot my ID in my other wallet.&quot; and walked out. So yeah I have not yet been back to that CVS after that exchange of weird lol.<br /><br />The next time I attempted to use bitinstant was through Walmart. This is definitely the way to go guys. Not only did they not ask to see my ID, I also didnt have to use the moneygram red phone. All you do is fill out a &quot;blue form&quot; which asks for your name and address and the information that bitinstant gives you. After this you hand the form over to the lady behind the counter and she does all the work for you, then you pay her and go on your way. I filled out 3 forms (dumb money cap) and each time I wrote down a new bullshit address and telephone. I ran into zero problems and will probably use walmart-bitinstant again. Also 90% of my btc arrived in my wallet within 15 minutes. for some reason the last of the money didnt come through until 1-2 hours later when I was&nbsp; transferring from my blockchain to my SR address. <br /><br />Long story short to the lazy people: Use walmart for your bitinstant transfer. they require no ID and you also dont have to use the annoying red phone.

I mean even if they have video of me what good does that do them? I highly doubt they&#039;re going to link me to SR. Even if they do so what? I doubt someone will take the time to go through video surveillance and try to get my identity for being sketchy. People use moneygram all the time to pay for bills. How would they know if I were using the system to buy legal bitcoins and how would they know I would use those bitcoins for SR? It just seems like an awful amount of work and time, not to mention a waste of time since they could never link me back to silk road.
