				I do not understand the use of trademarked logos and celebrity images/names on SR. I get that the seller is trying to use the image as either an attention getter or a way to differentiate his/her product or even perhaps show off a sense of humor. To be honest I think some of them are rather funny and/or clever and if I didn&#039;t think that there were a potential for repercussions I would not even voice my concerns.<br /><br />As we all are aware, or should be, LE is probably reading every post that is written on here as part of an investigation that is undoubtedly taking place on a global level. I am equally sure that a tab is being ran on every new vendor that posts and feedback is scrutinized to try to find any tiny angle into the circle. The point is that SR is being watched and I do not know why people would take the extra step of possibly angering and insulting powerful and influential companies and people that could bring more publicity (and therefore more resources) to SR. All it would take is a CEO of Nike or a celebrity with an agenda to focus unwanted attention our way on a public crusade. Even if it did not result in the end of SR, who wants or needs that kind of attention directed towards such a wonderful resource?<br /><br />There may be those who misunderstand my worry, I realize that copyright infringement is the least of the sellers/operators worries if the shit hit the fan. It is solely the attention prospect that I am concerned with. You do not do things to bring attention to yourself in situations like this. <br /><br />I will admit that I am no computer expert, I have a vague understanding of the safeguards that are in place in our community and to guard against LE shutting down SR. I do know that there is nothing that can be imagined that is not possible with the right amount of determination and resources. I also know that the &quot;impossible&quot; has been done time and time again throughout human history as well. I just feel like vendors should think twice before taking this route for notoriety.<br />

That&#039;s why they are as rich as they are.

				Interesting and thought provoking post OP, but unfortunately I think copyright infringement is pretty far down the list of worries on the Road.&nbsp; Seems to be mainly just for name recognition/recall purposes.
