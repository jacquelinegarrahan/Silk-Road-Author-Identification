				Well, it&#039;s interesting to watch, and very profitable for anyone holding BTC, but it&#039;s also a pain in the ass. The BTC market and BTC sellers are swamped and all in upheaval. My personal preference would be for my drug-buying currency to be a little more boring and predictable. I can go speculate on tulips or real estate in Dubai.

				It sure is nice that every time I come back the spare change from my last purchase is now enough to make another purchase.<br /><br />Mining difficulty has been increasing as miners miners have been increasing hashrate using ASICs. Since it&#039;s profitable for them, they can reinvest in more equipment, increasing hashrate even further. As this happens difficulty increases to balance it out. This increases the investment needed to begin mining, which makes bitcoins more scarce. Imagine how cheap gold would be if everybody could dig it up in their back yard.<br /><br />Once the hashrate starts to level off that &quot;scarcity&quot; will level as well, and the BTC price will level out. However once it levels miners will likely want to cash out earnings since they are no longer making money. Additionally, on sites like SR more people will hedge transactions in USD since there will be no benefit in keeping BTC. This could cause BTC to drop, causing more people to cash out. Mining may become unprofitable for some, causing miners to stop mining, and lowering difficulty.<br /><br />Whether or not BTC crashes will depend upon liquidity. As long as people are still buying BTC for transactions, there should be enough liquidity to maintain confidence. However, if there is not enough liquidity in the market to cover miners and investors selling off then the price will certainly fall drastically.

				I bought 3 BTC when it was $85 because I knew it would rise quite a bit. I made a couple orders and hung on to one for a week and a week and a half and watched the price rise to $130. Since I made $50 just letting it sit there, I cashed it out because I was in need of some cash. <br /><br />To my demise, the price has risen $70 since then and I would have been better off keeping that BTC rather than scurrying to cash it out. It is very frustrating, but at least I had all my bills paid in time. I just wish all this BTC business hadnt happened at a time where I wasn&#039;t on a budget.<br /><br />Investing takes risk, and I feel my luck would be next time I but some BTC it would drop. But the past 3 weeks hasnt shown any sign it will

				I wouldn&#039;t expect the prices to stop rising anytime soon.&nbsp; Everyday someone new is findiing out about sr. and is trying to buy bitcoins.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty cool thing to be a part of.&nbsp; Real freedom of choice.&nbsp; Of course the governments of the world don&#039;t like us to be able to decide what we do to our own bodies so they will surely try to step in. <br /><br />Hats off to anyone in the fight to keep SR alive and well

				and rising and rising no need for it to stop. If people would just pay more than the previuos, no limit, everyone could be rich, take all the money out of the governments and put into BTC. Let people take care of themselves

				be careful seriously, its growing by word of mouth not value. the rises are directly correlated w media coverage which shows that it isnt tied to value. for example its like a few people in high school think your cool because one cool person said u were, even though your not cool, but because a cool person said you were cool, other cool people will follow and next thing you know everyone thinks you&#039;re fucking cool. then someone figures out you&#039;re lame and it spreads just as fast. then you couldn&#039;t convince a damn sole your cool.<br /><br />cool=value
