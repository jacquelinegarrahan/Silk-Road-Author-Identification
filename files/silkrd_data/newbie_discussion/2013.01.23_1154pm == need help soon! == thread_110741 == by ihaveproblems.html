				That is really weird, and scary. I am surprised they actually came to your house and didn&#039;t send a letter. There is no way I would call back and make an appt. I read here there are laws protecting people, say &quot;somebodies ex wanted to cause them problems and sent an anonymous package of something illegal&quot;, that could and has happened. That is why I think you are in the clear by saying what you did. Who is to say someone wanted revenge and sent the package, just a scenario. I would certainly not have anything sent to your address again. I would go get a PO box or a box at another mail service (like a UPS store), in another town or area and use that for deliveries. I once got a letter from the US Postal Inspector (5 yrs ago), saying they had intercepted a possible contraband package and if I wanted to pick it up to call them, between such and such hours, otherwise it would be disposed of in 30 days. Needless to say, I threw the letter away and never heard from them again, but it scared the shit out of me, and it was something illegal in the US, but not in other countries, go figure. Anyway, just stick to your story and if they contact you again, just reiterate that you have no idea what it&#039;s about, and maybe hint at &quot;an ex-girlfreind is pissed off at you&quot; of course, due to respect, you can&#039;t divulge her name for privacy issues. Good Luck and let me know how it turns out, private message me, Diane&nbsp; :) :

				So, they were cool with your just walking away and calling them later?&nbsp; Is this for real?<br /><br />But anyway ... in the USA ... when dealing with LE ... it&#039;s worth repeating many times ...<br /><br />As a general rule, never give consent for a search.&nbsp; In fact, explicitly state that you do not consent to any searches.&nbsp; Exercise your right to remain silent.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not being arrested, ask if you&#039;re free to go.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not, you&#039;re being detained, but you don&#039;t have to answer any questions (although in some states you may have to identify yourself, and generally they&#039;re allowed to pat you down, briefly, and only in places where it would be reasonable to look for weapons).&nbsp; Tell them you don&#039;t want to talk about anything without a lawyer present.&nbsp; If they&#039;re not going to arrest you, they can only detain you long enough to reasonably complete their &quot;investigation.&quot;<br /><br />If you are stopped in your car, only roll down the window enough to talk to them and pass documents back and forth.&nbsp; Yes, you do mind if they look around the vehicle.&nbsp; And if you are asked to exit the vehicle, do so, but lock the car as you get out of it.<br /><br />Never leave shit out in plain sight.<br /><br />And yeah.&nbsp; Keep your mouth shut.&nbsp; They may lie to you, they may claim to have evidence they don&#039;t have, they may claim someone else involved has confessed when he hasn&#039;t, doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; Keep your mouth shut.<br /><br />It&#039;s psychologically normal to want to answer a person who is talking to you, but it&#039;s important to remember that in this kind of situation, law enforcement is much more of a predator on the hunt, not a person engaging in a mutually beneficial interchange of information.<br /><br />And check out the Know Your Rights videos on youtube. :)
