				I know all the vendors have there little tricks and PLEASE DO NOT disclose specifics on exactly how things are done or who does what. All I want to know is can it be done??? Is it being done with a very high success rate even across the border??? What about K-9 units who have an impeccable sense of smell??? What about the seizures you hear about on a regular basis is that because the vendor fouled up??

				Yes it can be done. But it all depends on the vendor and the amount of &#039;layers&#039; he uses. Check the &#039;shipping&#039; forum for more info.

				It is very doable, not every package gets closely examined, and as long as it is properly sealed and its easy enough to find out if a vendors packaging is up to snuff, just check their feedback.&nbsp; Properly packaged product&nbsp; looks like any other legal piece of mail that gets through.&nbsp; If you want/need some bud sent to you just hit up my vendor page and see if anything peaks your interest.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/fce0038339<br />WD

				I&#039;m actually more concerned about how much the buds get compressed. Ill only purchase from sellers with a good track record. Just read the reviews and even message the seller about their success over the border. Maybe they can customise the stealth to make you feel more comfortable?
