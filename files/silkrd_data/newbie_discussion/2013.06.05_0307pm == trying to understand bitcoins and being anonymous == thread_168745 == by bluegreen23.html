				So in my searches I came across<br /><br />http://www.technollama.co.uk/network-analysis-deflates-bitcoins-anonymity-myth (clear net)<br /><br />and the just of it seems to be that transactions can be traced. At least the transactions can be tracked from wallet to wallet. Not who owns the wallet I don&#039;t think but yeah... someone smarter and more tech experienced than myself please take a look and then make me feel safe again.

				I have bought btc twice so far. I used bitinstant moneygram at Walmart. The second time I purchased the clerk asked me if it was for the same account since I guess they keep a record of each transfer. So in my case im building a track record for sending money to zip zap. ( with a fake name. They dont seem to id at my Walmart). But im a newbie too so im also interested in hearing what someone who knows more has to add.

				Putting just one wallet between you and SR that you access via TOR is enough for basic plausible deniability. <br /><br />What does it say? It says only that you sent BTC to someone&#039;s wallet. Since you accessed this wallet via TOR, it can&#039;t be proven that it is you. And if SR was ever compromised without your knowledge and &quot;they&quot; were able to determine that the final destination wallet was SR and it came from that Tor accessed wallet, the simple question is *who* sent the BTC from that Tor accessed wallet? <br /><br />Unless you confess or say/do something* which breaches reasonable doubt, &quot;they&quot; can&#039;t prove you sent the BTC to SR and used it to purchase illegal schedule I items. <br /><br />Here&#039;s where submitting you address in PGP format comes in handy. ;)
