				I&#039;m debating if I should finalize early for SuperTrips. I was going to make my first purchase but his rules state that I have to finalize early if I&#039;m placing an order under $1000. I was reading reviews from other members in the SuperTrips post and it seems some people aren&#039;t getting their stuff. When I look under recent reviews in SR for SuperTrips though, I still see a bunch of people posting &quot;I FE early&quot; or FE for trusted seller. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to place an order and not receive anything and not be able to get a refund or reship. I have tried his product from someone else and ST&#039;s prices are really reasonable compared to others. What should I do?

				NEVER FE - I don&#039;t know that vendor, but the escrow system is there for 2 reasons - to protect the vendor as well as the buyer.&nbsp; try to find a vendor that won&#039;t require FE.

				Well you have no choice really dude! You can look for someone else but in all probabilities you will be asked to F/E unless you have over at least 20 purchases without no A/F ( auto finalize) I would wager, now you have been on here moaning about him ! He will probably not serve you anyway. But just read ,and read, and read and then more. You will find out whether to, Why don&#039;t you just F/E but buy the smallest&nbsp; parcel he sells and work your way up. You will get well established members telling you&quot; F/E is like asking a dog to play a trumpet&quot; not gunna happen. It&#039;s all very well saying that when you have established trust with your vendor, with over 200 transactions.But us newbs have to F/E. I F/E d on my first buy and he came through sound for me. I would recommend but he doesn&#039;t do your DOC.Good Luck!

				I&#039;ve been a member for over a year, with 50+ successful transactions.&nbsp; a &quot;trusted&quot; vendor asked me to FE recently, and I did, only to never receive the order.&nbsp; it was his way of &quot;cashing out&quot; and screwing me and several others over in the process.&nbsp; So i will never FE again and encourage others to do the same.

				If you can&#039;t afford a possible loss, don&#039;t do it. Simple as that.<br /><br />Without checking, I&#039;m pretty sure SuperTrips is a legit dealer, so it&#039;s not like he&#039;s gonna just take your money and run.<br /><br />Another thing, if you&#039;re looking for MDMA, I&#039;m pretty sure most Australians order their bulk MDMA from European suppliers, and as we all know Australian customs are ridiculously strict and packages often don&#039;t make it through. It is a possibility that most of the feedback on SR saying they didn&#039;t receive their package are ordering to Australia.

				Understand that certain vendors require FE.&nbsp; One of the great things about SR is the competition - you can almost always find a vendor that won&#039;t require FE.&nbsp; And as much as I would love to, I never completely trust any vendor anymore.&nbsp; Many of them have treated me very very well but after getting burned one time I advise others to not take any risks they are not comfortable with.&nbsp;

				ST had some falling out a bit back ago and was down to 70 some ratings, he got his shit together and is now climbing his ratings back up again! I would say he is safe at this point but if you want someone to FE with and trusted go with merury31. He even offers tracking on orders of 50+ grams and his prices are more than fair to boot his shit gets me and my friends high as fuck.

				the SR policy is to never FE. If you FE that means that you are saying you are fully satisfied with your order and thus SR can&#039;t help you if you get fucked over

				Im not complaining or nothing, but alot of vendors with big bulk orders always request FE(thats a huge risk, I would never FE for no one).&nbsp; Most small orders alot of vendors don&#039;t request Fe.&nbsp; But in all honesty, NO FE should be made a policy on SR or don&#039;t vend.&nbsp; When I first started out on SR I FE twice, burned twice.&nbsp; Never did it again, never got burned again. Just saying the site is really legit. SR is a really legit place so far, thanks.
