				Wish I didn&#039;t have to post it here, but silly rules say I need 50 posts of useless spam to post elsewhere.&nbsp; Anyways, I&#039;m wondering if anyone knows of a domestic, discrete shipper of MHRB.&nbsp; They can be non-SR, but SR is preferred.&nbsp; Help is appreciated, but please be reasonable.&nbsp; There is a special circle of hell for vendors who try and charge $1200 for 5 kilos of mimosa.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need a steady supply, only looking for about half a kilo.

				You should be able to get a half kilo for under $100, you can find vendors on google. Give me a few minutes and I&#039;ll see if I can find my old vendor.

				That would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I just know the DEA has been cracking down on people for importing or buying mimosa and the guy that I&#039;m helping locate a vendor for doesn&#039;t want his house raided (funny how they can raid your house for possessing a legal plant).&nbsp; Thanks again for the help.

				http://www.botanicalspirit.com/catalogue?q=mimosa?aref=3195<br /><br />Prices have gone through the roof! $125 for 1lb<br /><br />I guess the DEA has been working themselves to death on the drugs which aren&#039;t under cartel control.

				That&#039;s a terrible price.&nbsp; I mean those trees are practically invading the countries they grow in.&nbsp; I do appreciate the help anyways though, just wish someone had realistic prices.&nbsp; Acacia confusa works too, though isn&#039;t preferred.

				Here&#039;s a good TEDx talk about the War on &quot;Conciousness&quot; specifically part of the subject is Ayauasca. <br />CLEARNET LINK<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WaeMyC86Dw<br />I want to try my first tech. From what it looks like the Acacia works but has its issues. Found this thread looking to see if botanicalspirit is legit. Any experience with them?<br />I can&#039;t even consider this substance a recreational drug. When I first approached it that way I got a spiritual beatdown.<br />

				M.Hostillis is the easiest source material for making DMT by far. I have made my share and once I got the process down for making those fine white needle crystals that shit put me in my place in the Universe. That&#039;s for Fucking sure! I have a kilo of 1-2% RB but without a vending account cannot sell it here. Most of the shit that has been on the Internet in recent history has been pretty low quality. It is sad because with all those building developments going on in Mexico south to Brazil a lot of these trees get ripped up and just chipped... <br /><br />Good luck on finding your source material, but with a bit more work other source plants are very plentiful, but unlike hostillis often contain other DMT analogs like 5meo-DMT...<br /><br />mushmold&nbsp;

				The Southern US is infested with some sort of Mimosa tree, it&#039;s considered an invasive species down there. I never tried using it as a source material, but as I understand it all Mimosa species contain some amount of DMT.<br /><br />There is also Phalaris grass, but the amount of material needed is pretty large. Honestly, for the $125, you should be able to pull a fairly large amount from the half kilo, several grams at least, each pull degrades in quality so I&#039;d&nbsp; recommend keeping each pull separated.

Somewhere I read that there is another psychoactive in it though but the link to the info was broken. If I turn out to be wrong what an amazing thing that would be! They are a bit invasive as well and spread rapidly. I had a great grandma in&nbsp; the south and I was forever made to pull dozens of seedlings out of the lawn every year in the hot dry summer.<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albizia_julibrissin

				That&#039;s almost definitely it: I didn&#039;t realize it wasn&#039;t a true mimosa!

				go to http://bouncingbearbotanicals.com/ and look to your left at the selection Ayahuasca products. I&#039;ve gotten multiple things from there and they were good.
