				Hi All,<br /><br />I&#039;m a newbie to the site and seem to be having no end of problems getting cash into some kind of bitcoin account I can use here. I have asked for help, but I keep getting sent to sites that simply add to the confusion. All I need is a simple step by step list that will allow me to change cash into bitcoins with out a lot of extra nonsense. <br /><br />Thanks to anyone who can help me find that simple step by step list.<br /><br />Doral123

				simple way is to buy a load it card at cvs Walgreen etc and find a dealer on SR that has good feedback. Maybe want to message them first to see how long it will take them to send them to you. Most of them are fast few minutes to 2 or 3 hours. But this is by far the easy way to do this.

				before you go buying any cards i would find the vendor as some or most have a min for the cards<br />as they are getting harder to use.

				i used to use bitinstant but recently ive been using a vendor called jumbomonkeybiscuit that has been very reliable and takes reloadit, greendot and cash in mail for BTC all you do is give him the codes on the card and you have your BTC in a few hours. he does charge a 15% processing fee but its the easiest way of obtaining BTC. a vendor named kensho does reloadit and moneypack cards with no processing fee but isnt always accepting orders. good luck!

				If you are in the US the quickest and easiest way is BitInstant. It just takes a payslip from bitinstant.com that you take to Wal-Mart or Walgreens. Once you pay the slip it takes about 15 minutes to 2 hours for the coin to show...

				Another option to consider, and what I use is Coinbase.com Link it with your bank account and at the click of a button you can buy coins...downside is it takes a few days to complete a purchase but it&#039;s easy as hell. Beats going to CVS and paying the expensive bitinstant fee I think.
