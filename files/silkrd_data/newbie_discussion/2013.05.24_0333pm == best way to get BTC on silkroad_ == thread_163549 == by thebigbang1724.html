				To help out newbs, I wrote a bitcoin basics guide--for buyers--which tells you, recipe-style,&nbsp; how to ANONYMOUSLY buy bitcoins using cash, and then transfer bitcoins to the Road, with a total time of 2-4 hours.<br /><br />The services involved are bitinstant and MtGox. The guide is current as of May 22nd, 2013.<br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />Order the free guide at:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d05b9deccc<br /><br />The reason the guide has to be downloaded is that it is a PDF. It&#039;s clean, well-formatted, and as easy to follow as a recipe. If I were to post it on this forum, it would be a long and hard to follow.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not selling it; I&#039;m giving it away. The reason you order it from me is so that I can gauge how much interest there is in this topic, and start to establish myself as a reputable vendor. I&#039;ve been a buyer for a long time but only got my vendor account recently.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedure outlined in this guide dozens of times with no problems.<br /><br />Happy Trails!<br />MedicineWoman

				Someone in the US should seriously give consideration to providing a cash lodgement / transfer service for non-US people. I would do it if I were there myself!

				I personally use bitinstant and put the transfer into my mtgox account and then transfer it to an ewallet and then into my SR account to make it even harder to track.&nbsp; This is one of the best methods IMO.

				CannaConnection1, that sounds like a perfect option, but I understand US clients can make cash lodgements at bank locations and transfer from there. This is something not readily available in the EU or elsewhere (although we do have SEPA), but somone in the US will setup a &#039;lodge your cash&#039; service at some point and make a fortune!

Typical pathway is:<br /><br />(Put in a request for transfer through Dwolla) -&gt; (Bank sends funds to Dwolla) -&gt; (Dwolla confirms transaction and forwards to exchange)<br /><br />Profit. :)

				If I have the time to do it, I&#039;ve found coinbase to be the most legitimate of the online bitcoin exchangers.&nbsp; However it does take four days to process a transaction.&nbsp; When I&#039;m in a hurry to get coins in I go the bitinstant to MTGOX route.

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
