				Hello all, does anyone have any other methods of buying bitcoins, the place i am using now takes forever to receive and requires bank account. I know theres a way to use a money-gram or something as well but any other ways i would appreciate learning. :)

				I&#039;ve heard that SEPA transfers to Bitstamp work very well.<br /><br />Avoid MtGox!<br /><br />Intersango is okay as well, but their withdraw fees are absurd and the userbase is tiny (and you need an invite, I may have one).

				I use bitinstant and pay cash at a local location to have a moneygram sent electronically.&nbsp; I use a fake name/address, and have never been asked to show an ID.<br />The site walks you through it and the process is easy enough....you send your moneygram to a nondescript looking intermediary company and it will arrive in a bitcoin wallet or email address of your choice in an hour or so.<br /><br />I can&#039;t comment on any others because I&#039;ve only used the above, but this wiki entry has a ton of info on different services, exchanges, and 3rd party vendors:<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins

				I use viriwox. Sure it is a tad more expensive, like 10 percent or so, but you have the plausible deniability of buying &quot;virtual money&quot;, like Linden dollars.

				Now, disclaimer as I&#039;m not 100% sure this is completely anonymous - but here is how I&#039;ve gotten my BTC to the road for well over a year.<br />https://www.virwox.com/&nbsp; &nbsp;- It is a Second Life (the game) currency exchange. They offer MANY (paypal, wire transfer, etc...) ways to deposit cash into what are called Linden Dollars. This is the currency used in second life. After converting to Linden Dollars you can INSTANTLY transfer to BTC. After that all it takes is withdrawing BTC to your Silk Road Wallet. Entire process takes about an hour - and then your coins are in your wallet.<br />Let me know if it isn&#039;t the most secure form of making BTC deposits... but it has worked excellently for me for well over a year.

				But a very expensive way to go surely.<br />Why don,t you try somewhere like coinbase,(https://coinbase.com)<br />or is anonymity important to you? You get an e-wallet as well.
