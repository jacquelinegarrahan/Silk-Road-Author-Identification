				depends on what kind of trip you want to have. for short but intense dmt should be just fine. but if you have enough time and feel capable of tripping longer, then just take acid. <br /><br />also, lsd is easier to administer as you can just take it orally. :)

				the two substances are completely different trips.. DMT is just fucking beautiful amazing visuals without all the head looping and supper high me moments ;D acid is wonderful don&#039;t get me wrong.. but after experiencing both you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about...<br /><br />Also, why only try the one :P they&#039;re both so amazing :)

				http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/18s7pl/before_asking_questions_about_x_vendors_lsd/ <br />here is a list of good/bad vendors if you&#039;re taking acid. <br />basically you can just look up for stuff in the marketplace and when something catches your eye, explore the vendor&#039;s stats and later on search for information about him in forums. that way you will know if he is not a scammer.

				IMO, if you&#039;ve never done psychedelics before, I would NOT recommend you start by freebasing DMT. DMT is the most powerful thing I&#039;ve ever. I imagine it feels a lot like dying, and can be scary and overwhelming if you&#039;re not used to the psychedelic experience. Launching yourself into DMT space for a first go around could very well scare you away from the whole idea of psychedelics.<br /><br />The way I see it, (and also quite literally), DMT is the father of the tryptamine family. It is &quot;the main vein&quot; as Terence McKenna puts it. It is the most powerful psychedelic of all, and you should work your way up to it slowly, not start there.<br /><br />My recommendation, would be that your start with mushrooms. Mushrooms are a lot of fun, and you remain &quot;in this world&quot; for the most part, there is just an added quality to the reality you are already familiar with. All the action happens in your head, and a mushroom trip can be very powerful and profound, but as long as you dose properly (3.5-5g) you will experience a psychedelic journey that doesn&#039;t take you TOO far from home, which is why I believe it would be the perfect introduction to psychedelics.<br /><br />Jumping into DMT is definitely not recommended. Get your feet wet with mushrooms, work your way up to LSD, and if you&#039;re still enjoying yourself, then think about DMT.<br /><br />My .02 BTC
