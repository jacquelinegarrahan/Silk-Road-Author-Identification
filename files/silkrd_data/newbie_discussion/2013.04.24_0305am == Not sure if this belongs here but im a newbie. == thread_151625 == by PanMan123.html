				Been browing silkroad for a long time. Iv looked into buying BTC for a while i just cant figure out how. I already have the wallet on my computer and i think i know how to use it. You click receive. Copy that number and you get the bitcoins in that &quot;account&quot;. Also i think i got a clear handle on PGB. Im from canada iv googled around but i can&#039;t seem to find any site i think are legit. I have found one. Im not sure if im aloud to post links but its called canadianbitcoins.com you go to the bank make a deposit into their account etc and receive the BTC a few hours later or something like that. Just wondering if anyone has used that site before or knows of any legit sites i can use in canada.

				The best way I&#039;ve found to purchase BTC in Canada is through Virtex.&nbsp; www.virtex.ca<br /><br />They are a BTC exchange like MTGOX.&nbsp; You can purchase BTC anonymously via cash deposit at any BMO in Canada.&nbsp; You make a deposit transaction on the site using whatever id you registered with (using any email address you want) and then make the deposit at the BMO for that exact amount.&nbsp; They check the account several times a day and credit your account when they find the deposit at the BMO.&nbsp; Then you just have to login to Virtex and place a buy order for however many BTC you can afford.&nbsp; You can buy at the current rate or you can place an order to buy at lower than the current rate and it will be filled the minute someone sells at that price.<br /><br />There is a $ limit on the amount of cash you may deposit in a 90 day period so long as you stay anonymous. Remember, it is not illegal to buy or sell BTC, so you could easily register with the site and get rid of the limits.<br /><br />When you transfer your BTC out of your virtex account, just don&#039;t send it directly to SR, send it to your own personal wallet, then to SR.<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty easy, I&#039;ve been using them for 18 months now.

I just with there was a scotia/BMO near me. The only reason i wanted to do it with the other site is because they do it with CIBC and its not as far away as the other banks, but it doesn&#039;t seem as legit. Thanks for the advice.
