				Hi Noobs,<br /><br />Whilst I am also classed a noob here on SR; I am far from that in the real world.<br /><br />I have over my own life consumed most mind altering substances which exist; with patches of serious addition to amphetamine, coke etc.<br /><br />In later years I discovered completely by chance a substance known as DMT.<br /><br />After just one attempt I immediately &quot;broke though&quot; and this my life changed.<br /><br />I had never experienced anything like this......I was humbled and &quot;cured&quot; from my weekly want of uppers / downers, etc - NO more uncontrollable addiction!<br /><br />I touched the &quot;GodHead&quot; by being transformed into pure consciousness and connected to the power that just is.<br /><br />It&#039;s been around 4yrs since the first DMT hit and I still remain not wanting for anything other than my weed (obviously!) and the occasional once a month or so,&nbsp; DMT journey.<br /><br />It&#039;s my Favorite substance by far, where the physical DEFINITELY meets the spiritual - absolutely changed my world view / perspective.<br /><br />It felt like my regular binary &quot;thought process&quot; had instantly separated from my consciousness (soul?!) and then been liberated with quantum powers which were now able to tap into unexplainable dimensions or higher levels of existence; COMPLETELY unexplainable by modern science&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I have a fervent passion / purpose to share this experience with as many people as I can.&nbsp; I view DMT as an invaluable spiritual and healing medicine in today&#039;s world.<br /><br />(Hence my presence here!)<br /><br />Whats is your personal FAVORITE? and more importantly why?<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				First experience with dissociative was with a low, accidental 3rd platue dose of DXM combined with marijuana... Yeah not the best place to start. Nothing like thinking your going to either have a heart attack, seizure or full blown panic attack every 10 seconds. Strangely I was fine if I was standing, but if I sat down, say in-front of the computer, my vision would feel as if it was about to blink out and the screen even turned red and loomed out at me once.<br /><br />In hindsight though it was still a useful experience. I was absolutely wrecked yet still managed to keep it together in the end. Also learned the importance of setting.<br />Trouble is it&#039;s hard to tell wether the symptoms were just hallucinations or if it was related to high blood pressure.<br /><br />I have taken DXM a few times since with varying results, but I decided in the end that it wasn&#039;t worth it. Every time after seems to be tainted by the early bad experience and I tend to feel nervous before I take it.<br /><br />I have a soft spot for benzo&#039;s, not only for occasional recreation but also because they are incredibly useful in certain situations. Obviously can&#039;t take them too often, tend to make me emotionally dead after a week or so of continual use. And there is no way in hell I ever want to go through a benzo withdrawal. <br /><br />Oh and Marijuana obviously, just wish there was no such thing as tolerance. <br /><br />

				Thanks to everyone who has posted, it&#039;s great to have fresh conversation about peoples personal experiences / favorite substances and their views as to why!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Please keep posting your experiences pointing out your favs and especially WHY, could be a very positive thread where people can read about the good things that we all get from our substances&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Makes a nice change from what seems to be a spamming arena!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />PS - Just to give the flip side from my favorite DMT, it&#039;s Salvia&nbsp; &gt;:( ....I have never feared an experience so much in all my life, it felt life my brain particles were being split and mixed up, like a food blender had been rammed in my head then turned on to full!!! Dimensions riiiiiipping apart followed by a slow and protracted coming together again.....thought that I had really done myself brain damage at the time!&nbsp; and took a good 30 mins to recover - NEVER again lol<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES<br />

				One time i took 3xtc pills in 3hours period when i was 14yo, it was not i high dose or something, we just got 1for each 3times in 3hrs and&nbsp; when the effects wear i smoked a gram of weed(actually about 0.8g) and i got fucking high as fucking fuck, my face was white as snow, even friends didnt want to be with me because i looked like junkie, then i went to my house staircase and was tripping hard, i heard a pleasurable sound like BOOM but it was diffrent than a bang, and i something like ball of that sound floating around the stairs and there was something like sound waves coming from it, and thats not all. it was amazing but i was little scared at the time, how weed and couple of pills earlier that day could do this thing. i would like to feel that again, very intresting experience :). Maybe someone from here had similar experience with those MDMA/WEED mix? I did alot of that mix with same pills after that but never was in anything like that what happend from it. (bad englsih)

				psychedelics<br /><br /><br />I prefer LSD and schrooms but will use good quality RC&#039;s as well<br /><br />I love weed too but good quality Amsterdam style is something Ive not tried to buy on SR. just like Coke as i can get good qual of the streets and see the actual goods im buying. SR is a bit hit and miss on things and with coke and cannabis i&#039;d just rather see it.<br /><br />I&#039;m here for the things not on my street. like good actual really acid. these jokers lying about there shit or not know should have the heads cut off. or at least put then on the anti schindler list and let hitler sort them out in hell.<br /><br /><br />NN

				Personally, I absolutely LOVE methylone, yes, Methylone&gt;MDMA! IME, methylone is much better fit in a calm environment with close friends. I find it bonds my relationships and brings my really good friends closer. It&#039;s like there&#039;s not a thing in the world I can&#039;t tell them, which is also why I only roll with very close friends, not just random people. I should also note that I like a nice dose of at least .4 on an empty stomach (for that nice, fast come up), although .5 is preferable for some mind boggling euphoria. I&#039;ll bump another .5 after about 4 hours so I can keep it goin as well :D<br /><br />I have never tried heroin, meth, or cocaine yet, which I plan to try. I cannot wait!<br /><br />Anyone who has done molly and heroin, how can you explain the difference between the euphoria gained from doing molly vs euphoria from heroin?<br />I&#039;m very experienced in opiates and have done tons and tons of morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone (by god that oxymorphone is incredible). I have heard oxymorphone is on par with heroin but would like to hear from you guys with experience

				I&#039;ve tried just about every substance I&#039;m interested in trying (except mescaline), but over the years I have become more and more into just consuming my favorite, bud and hash.<br />That being said I feel like MDMA is by far the best feeling of anything, but I&#039;ve drifted off from harder drugs over the years and I&#039;m all about bud.<br />I also spent a year down in S. America and had my decent run with blow, and I&#039;ve always had a love for benzos and tripping is always fun!<br />MM54

				If I had to pick one substance out of all, I&#039;d have to say cannabis because who doesn&#039;t love a nice fat blunt after a long day at the office, however psilocybin mushrooms and 25c-NBOMe are always a fun learning experience and have helped pull me out of many dark periods, including getting over a nasty oxycodone addiction.

				I liked your post. Have you ever read about DMT on Erowid?? I would like to know your opinion on what a &quot;perfect&quot;setting would be and the quantity of DMT you ingested. I am in the place you said you were-a place where I cannot get a damn thing done/accomplished/a formulated thought, etc etc without my current go-to buddies which sadly are: addy, oxy, benzo-taken at once, 2-3 xs/day.<br />Mind you, three years ago one would never have caught me taken anything more than tylenol, although I drank and smoked herb when younger.&nbsp; I admit its a horrid cycle and one that is extremely tough to break. <br />Peace

				From age 17 until around 4 years ago, I indulged myself (on and off) in frequent bouts of serious substance abuse. <br /><br />Some impacted me more than others.<br /><br />- Cannabis - Smoked everyday since the age of 15 (and still do).<br />- Clubbing Scene Ecstasy / MDMA - x 3 Re-visited for up to a year or two at a time.<br />- Amphetamine abuse including &quot;Speedbombs&quot;, Base, Paste, etc<br />- Cocaine abuse including Crack <br />- LSD / Magic Mushrooms - Not too often over the years, but always good experiences.<br />- Valium &amp; various other pills.<br />- Heroin - Never did this thank goodness!<br />- Legal Highs - Mephedrone and many others (THIS SHIT NEARLY KILLED ME)<br /><br />Basically to add some background to the above drug taking, I was always able to abuse but kept things on track with the job and family responsibilities. There were two exceptions during the last 22yrs:<br /><br />1. Clubbing Scene (late 20’s) - on the 3rd time around, one time I hadn&#039;t slept for 2 - 3 day and went to work and more or less passed out. I was signed off work for two weeks to recover. To be fair I felt fine after a couple of days rest / sleep but still a shock to the system.<br /><br />2. Legal Highs (37-39) - This was something that completely crushed me (Methadrone). I had previously developed an addiction on speed/coke and this carried over to the legal highs. The buzz on this stuff was incredibly dirty and I went wild on the stuff. <br /><br />To cut a very painful story short, I didn&#039;t sleep for 4 or 5 nights, fell into psychosis and had the most public and embarrassing breakdown you could ever imagine. I found myself not trusting my own family / friends and had suicidal thoughts, as I felt manically depressed and could see no way to get myself back to who I once was. <br /><br />I thought I had given myself brain damage. My parents were going to get me sectioned and it was my brother and friends who stopped that from happening. <br /><br />After being signed off my work by my doctor, I nervously returned but continued battling the demons. <br /><br />Legal Highs had literately turned me into a zombie and I hated myself.<br /><br />Things HAD to change.<br /><br />Things did improve slightly over the course of that last year, I got a semblance of “normality and routine” but my confidence still lacked and I felt I was definitely a shadow of my former self. I felt I had lost brain power, my “mojo” and lust for life.<br /><br />It was at this point around April 2009, that I made my wish. I took the time to ask with all of my heart for something to happen to me, that might give me back what I knew I had lost to Legal Highs and the massive breakdown I endured (was still enduring). <br /><br />It was from that day that I started searching the internet for self-help / self-therapy / meditation / confidence tapes, etc<br /><br />I bounced around from one idea to another, trying this and that, with absolutely no success……although I would highly recommend Dale Carnegies “How to win friends and influence people” - a great read for anyone.<br /><br />I had noticed once or twice during my reading online, mentions of DMT and eventually one VERY fateful night - I got around to finding out what it was all about.<br /><br />After googling DMT, the first thing I ended up watching was Terrence McKenna’s You Tube - “Rap Dancing into the Third Millenium”.<br /><br />I remember vividly it was a weeknight and I started to listen to his speech around 11pm. To say I was gobsmacked by what this man was saying is a massive understatement; I could barely sleep and was thinking about it all the next day. When I got home and the kids got off to bed, I immediately started to read more and more about this unbelievable substance. At this point I had no thoughts on trying the stuff (I was COMPLETELY OFF DRUGS, apart from cannabis anyway); But I was just totally getting off on reading and watching as much as I could. <br /><br />I just couldn’t believe it was in us naturally; the birth, sleep and death releases…..Hyperspace, the Hive, dimensional travel, Entities!<br /><br />I mean what the F!!!<br /><br />UNBELIEVABLE – I read and read and read and read from April 2009 until August 2009. Thanks DMT Nexus &amp; Erowid!<br /><br />I convinced myself that DMT was NOT a drug in the regular sense and that it might be useful for me to try it. <br /><br />DMT had found me and for a reason….<br /><br />So, that’s when I extracted my own Spice from MHRB and took my first launch in to the DMT Dimension :-)<br /><br />THIS was what I had wished for – THIS was the therapy I had needed.<br /><br />My setting was all about my own personal mindset of “Wishing to get back to my regular self” - Setting is an internal thing, not external (although being somewhere you are comfortable and with someone you trust does help).<br /><br />I went in with the wish for my brain / mind to be “reset” in someway and it certainly did that and more! A full system reboot on around 60-80mg of DMT via a Glass Bong was all I needed.<br /><br />At today’s date, I have my confidence back in spades and my mojo has never glowed so brightly, I see everything once more through the eyes of a child – Full of wonder once again.<br /><br />As for what is happening to me in the DMT World, well that’s a different set of stories, for a different day.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES<br /><br /><br />

				For recreational use, MDMA is my personal favorite. I do enjoy some natural green, but it tends to cause more anxiety for me than the good highs i used to get. Some people tell me it&#039;s because I took a long, long break from cannabis.<br /><br />Lorazepam and clonazepam are other favorites, not so much on a recreational level but from a functionality standpoint. Helps me get through the days :)

				I used to love ketamine best of all. The last time I did it I enjoyed the cooking much more than the actual experience, though. A roommate and I took the day off work to play hooky and have fun. We did two bumps apiece after we had cooked it up, barfed, didn&#039;t enjoy ourselves, and the rest of the vial just sat around unused until we moved and we just threw it away (in an unpleasant neighbor&#039;s garbage). <br /><br />I was a big fan of candyflipping back in the day- the terminology is probably outdated by now and gives you an idea of how old I am. I stopped some time ago because the e-pression was lasting for weeks and it wasn&#039;t worth the few fleeting hours of living in a world where everything is right and beautiful for a change. <br /><br />I like to smoke weed. I smoke weed pretty much every day. Actually, that&#039;s not true- I vaporize it these days because I&#039;m trying to take better care of myself. I miss acid sometimes, but it gets difficult to find once you reach a certain age and your social circle is a bunch of respectable professionals. I always wanted to try DMT, but I guess I was never in the right place at the right time. I also like hash, which I acquired on a recent vacation- that was nice. I liked opium when I could find it, too. I will always enjoy the smell of opium. <br /><br />Coke, otoh, I never really cared for. I could actually tell what a socially-inappropriate asshole I was being, but I was powerless to control it. I always just wanted more and more without having very much fun in the process. I liked meth, but never enough for it to be something I sought out; I&#039;d do it if was around, but I never cared to buy my own stash. These days, I do a pretty good job of being high-strung on my own, so I don&#039;t really go looking for anything that will exacerbate that. I just like to relax.

				Weed and heroin - not IV, but IM - lasts longer, you don&#039;t have to worry about OD and I prefer the mellow effect of IM to the rush of IV. Just a perfect way to spend an afternoon. I&#039;ve been doing it<br />for 2 years and I&#039;m not addicted - you just have to stop using for 1 week every month.

				Hi, I&#039;m a noob here but I&#039;ve done many LSD, MDMA when I was 22. Mostly LSD :) I&#039;m now 34 and lately I discovered SR. Until today my favorite is LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been placed my first order of DMT today, hopefully my poor buyer stats (3 purchases and 2 months account), won&#039;t stop the vendor from shipping my order. and hopefully it will be my favorite too!!<br /><br />Pace<br />

				Hi All,<br /><br />Just wanted to report in and let y&#039;all know that I did get over my fear (Thanks MachineElves!) and finally did the DMT earlier this week ;D<br /><br />I am now really torn as to my favorite, as what I experienced after my 2nd attempt on this crazy stuff is really hard to put into words.<br /><br />I still think weed is my daily love, but DMT showed me things on that &quot;journey&quot; I still cannot explain. I seen crazy colors and felt such a mix of emotions and a deep sense of traveling towards what seemed like a kinda large dome shape but it (they?) wouldn&#039;t let me in which made feel sad at the time as i felt i had to get in.......can&#039;t really remember much more other than amazing shapes and what seemed like vibrations. <br /><br />I want to do this again as soon as possible as i really do have a need to know what is further. <br /><br />Absolutely, the weirdest overwhelming and amazing experience ever&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Great stuff and highly recommended!!<br /><br />Interested in anyone else&#039;s experiences, and would love to hear some stories from fellow travellers.

				Well nothing beats nice clean MDMA, there&#039;s nothing quite like it. Too bad you can&#039;t take it all the time and for me the after effects are really not the greatest so its something I very rarely do. Other than that got to say 2c-b is my favorite. Its similar to mdma with lsd though not nearly as potent as both of them. Gives you a really nice body high along with psychedelic properties and for some reason this is the only psychedelic i&#039;ve seen colors on!! LSD didnt do that to me. but yeah its really nice and not too overwhelmingly psychedelic in my opinion. I can even eat/drink on 2c-b compared to other psychedelics. Definitely worth trying.

				Great Post and loving the variety of responses!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />I am now 27 and my own personal favorite is DMT (My forum name is a give away I would guess!!), however this revelation is just a very very new and exciting thing to me.<br /><br />I did my fair share of dabbling in various things, with my all time favs being coke, mdma &amp; legal highes....basically whatever would keep me up all night dancing and drinking!!!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />That was until a very and close dear friend asked my if I wanted to try DMT, as he had acquired some.<br /><br />I jumped at the chance not knowing really what to expect - I don&#039;t know if that was a good thing or not&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />What happened was, that I had the very first (of many) experience(s) that I could truly call &quot;Religious&quot; or &quot;Spiritual&quot;.&nbsp; It took me days to try to integrate that experience into my day to day life.&nbsp; Everything just seemed the same but &quot;different&quot;.....but in a very good way!<br /><br />The wonders of the &quot;spice&quot; never seem to amaze me. I will be hard pushed to find anything which matches it&#039;s instant wonderment.<br /><br />Changes EVERYTHING.&nbsp; 8) 8) 8) <br />

				Seeing as everyone is talking about DMT..you guys should really read &quot;DMT, The Spirit Molecule&quot; by Dr. Rick Strassman (amazing book) and you could even watch the series Magical Egypt on youtube, specifically the &quot;Navigating the Afterlife&quot; episode, it gives some insight into the possible source of the substance in our bodies and also what times in our lives we may be exposed to the substance naturally. Pretty interesting.

Having tried recently ( bought from machineelves on SR - They have a fantastic and informative profile page) ,I would agree that, NN-DMT is rather &#039;special&#039;. <br />Totally different from ANYTHING else.......... Bold but true statement. <br />Try it for yourselves, and get from these guys ( machineelves ), they were happy to discuss with me and help me through my first experience.<br />I&#039;m going back for more soon, and will get a few mates to club together, to get a bigger bag&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />LSD/ACID - Unpredicable... Not like&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; Never looked , no interest.<br /><br />Keep them coming folks, very enjoyable reading

				In high school I was introverted, lacking in self confidence, but with a great set of friends.<br /><br />College came, same set of friends, they introduced me first to hash, then to speed, then I tried my 1st acid trip and.. BOOM... my life changed. I was opened up to new levels of beauty and wonder and that changed me forever.<br /><br />Next arrived the 90&#039;s and the rave scene - my 1st ever ecstasy was in a house I lived in with friends, a 12 bedroom house with 20 inhabitants, who loved to live the life. We hosted a party and hundreds of people attended. I dropped a white dove in a friend&#039;s bedroom and felt the rush as a friend of a friend introduced me to his music.<br /><br />Again..<br /><br />BOOM!<br /><br />My life at that point had changed forever. The whole communal, loved-up vibe, the whole mass experience of shared joy and wonder, has stayed with me forever. It has informed my opinions of race, gender and sexuality. If it wasn&#039;t for MDMA, I wouldn&#039;t be me.<br /><br />So, at a guess, I&#039;d say MDMA has been pretty good for me.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)
