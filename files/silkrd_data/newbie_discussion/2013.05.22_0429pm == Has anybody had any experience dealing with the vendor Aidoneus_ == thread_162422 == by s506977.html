				LMAO this thread is pretty bullshit atm, here we go:<br /><br />I rolled two nights last weekend of this vendor&#039;s gear. Holy shit, it was soooo much fun you have no idea. The product itself is incredibly pure, and was the best I had ever done. Here is the review that I wrote for them and will post as soon as I get my 50:<br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Hello Everyone,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I have made a handful of purchases off this vender over the last month and a half, and I held off on the review until I had tried the product. I gave them a go with a could close friends at a festival last weekend and had an absolutely stunning time. <br /><br /><br />Purchasing and Shipping:<br /><br />Buying these was an absolute breeze! The vendor very quickly (within 24 hours) updated the order from &#039;processing&#039; to &#039;in transit,&#039; and the order came three days after the update. I would never have imagined that SR packages could be processed and delivered so smoothly and with so few hitches. I made my first purchase with these guys, and they will get you the goods in a very timely fashion. 5/5 on purchasing and shipping.<br /><br /><br />Stealth:<br /><br />Many people are raving about the stealth, because it is insanely good. Not only is it disguised incredibly well, but the extreme care and thought the vendor put into really gives me huge confidence in them and their system. Very impressive, 5/5.<br /><br />Product:<br /><br />I used these just last weekend at a festival, and they were astonishingly good. Here is basically how we used them and what happened:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A friend and I (each about 180 lbs) each take one 140mg pill, and start feeling the effects 45 minutes later. We were both very surprised at how quickly it came on, making us really excited about the quality and the effects still to come. At about 55-65 minutes in, my friend and I spent probably two minutes starting into each others eyes, in utter shock at the quality of the goods. After some very excited shouts to one another, we dive into the magic of the festival, peaking fairly sometime in the 70-80 range. On the first pill I felt as if the peak lasted about ten minutes. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both took our second pill at about 2.5 hours after the first. The second pill felt even better than the first, and combined with the festival environment, turned everything into an amazing surreal adventure. After coming up, I was peaking for probably 20-25 minutes straight, dancing up a frenzy like I never have before. In retrospect, my body was probably not ready to have the 140mg doses that close together, so I might give it another half hour in between next time. All and all, both my friend and I had the best of times, thanks in no small part to these goods. 5/5<br /><br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br /><br />These caps are pretty strong, and the doses are perfect for my body weight. Some different friends tried them another time this week, and were blown away by the purity. One of them (130 lb girl) who normally takes &#039;.2&#039; thought the come up and roll was incredibly strong after only taking 100mg. <br /><br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />The dosing amount was perfect for me, the products are great, and I&#039;ll definitely be back for more. 5/5<br /><br />We also met a couple who was also using Aidoneus products and now we are best friends!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thank You b85ZpYX for such an in-depth and detailed review of this vendor. <br /><br />That is more of what I was hoping for when I started this thread. <br /><br />People like you are what makes SR great.

				Apparently, these guys are on fucking point.&nbsp; They have got the best-selling listing for USA domestic MDMA at the moment.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried them, but it would seem like a safe bet.&nbsp; Someone recently sent a capsule to Edata.org, and their lab results confirmed MDMA: 1, and nothing else.&nbsp; The title for the capsule given by the sender was SR-Aidoneus, so I guess there&#039;s no proving where it actually came from, but based on the reviews, one of these gets a low tolerance user quite ecstatic.&nbsp; At $11 a hit, some might say it&#039;s too expensive, but at 140 mg of supposedly uncut unmolested quality synthesis MDMA Hcl, others would say it&#039;s right on the money.&nbsp; I know for a fact that people are WAY more willing to buy a dose after seeing another person smiling and rolling their ass off (hearsay) from just one dose.&nbsp; A pill like this could easily be resold for $15-$20 at the right party to the right people (in other words, not at the projects reenactment of black hawk down).&nbsp; &quot;Bath salts?&nbsp; anybody wanna buy some bath salts?&nbsp; got yer bath salts right here folks, step right up!&nbsp; You there, yes you, the negroe boy on the couch!&nbsp; You look like you&#039;re from somalia, how&#039;d ya like to buy some $3 cathinones!<br /><br />As my friend so eloquently out it, &quot;people just want to get off&quot;<br /><br />What I have been hearing as of late is a lot of distrust for pressed stuff.&nbsp; Makes sense, considering I haven&#039;t laid eyes on an MDMA only pill for nearly 2 years now, and I&#039;ve never seen a dutch pill in my life.&nbsp; Hence, dosed out quality MDMA powder is likely to sell well, especially after a bioassay.

				Two more points:<br /><br />First: the first time I every rolled, I had a very &#039;mind blowing&#039; experience, as if I had been plucked from the matrix or something. That didn&#039;t happen when I used these products, but shit it was sooo much fun I did not care. <br /><br />Second: you can totally split these pills if you have to, and swallow half a pill at a time. MDMA tastes kinda gross if you have never tasted it before, but with these caps you have that flexibility. <br /><br />$11 dollars is still mightily cheaper than anything I can find on the street, just buy it and have a good time. shit

				I did a lot of research before purchasing anything off of SR. I wanted to try MDMA explicitly, so, that&#039;s what I mostly focused on. It would be my first order from SR and of taking MDMA. Let&#039;s just say that Aidoneus did not disappoint in any way.<br /><br />Shipping/Stealth/Etc: Excellent. I ordered priority shipping with tracking and it was in my mailbox in two days. Packing/stealth wise, I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect, but once I opened it up, it was done perfectly.<br /><br />Product itself: This was my first time taking MDMA, so, I have no experience prior to this. Having said that, I seem to be very tolerant to most drugs and I&#039;m a bigger guy, so I typically need a bigger dose than what most might consider &quot;normal&quot;. I was cautious at first and only took one. An hour in I just felt a little tingling in my head so I decided to take another one, and 30-40 mins later it hit me hard, incredibly so. It was an incredible rush and it nearly knocked me off my ass at points; where I had to sit to avoid falling flat on my face. The only downside was a case of jaw clenching and teeth grinding, but I was expecting that from doing my research. It was probably one of the best &quot;trips&quot; I&#039;ve ever been on with any of the drugs I&#039;ve tried so far (which isn&#039;t a lot, mind you :P). In fact, it&#039;s very hard to be responsible and wait the 1-3 months recommended already, but I know that it would probably not hit me that way again so soon anyway.<br /><br />TL;DR: Excellent vendor with a superb product. I hope the eight I have left last me until he comes back from vacation... depends on how good I am or not ;).

				&nbsp;;D ;D<br />Figured we would drop in on the fun that is the newbie forums! Hiiii!<br />A couple points, we guess:<br /><br />1) we have been the #1 US Domestic MDMA supplier for some time - top 2% of vendors WORLDWIDE!<br />2) if you&#039;ve &#039;heard bad things&#039;, you&#039;re misinformed. <br />3) we don&#039;t discriminate against new accounts/buyers and take pride in providing quality customer service. How else would we have (100) rating with over 1000 transactions!?<br /><br />Order with confidence (after we come back from vacation, anyway)!<br />If you have a chance to try our goodies, have fun!<br /><br />If anyone has questions let us know! We&#039;ll be around. <br />.Whish.
