				So, Ive got half a gram of pure alprazolam, but I have no idea how to deal it out.&nbsp; Im thinking gelcaps, but theres no gellies that small, nor do I know what do dilute it with, and my scale cant measure the mg Im going for.&nbsp; I would gladly split it into 25mg bags of powder, but there&#039;s very little accuracy i can provide.&nbsp; Does anyone have a solution? Im dealing with 250 bars worth of alpraz, and it looks like the weakest bag of blow I&#039;ve ever bought! Not a lot of product to split, so accuracy is key, and Im out of ideas. PLEASE HELP!!

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Thing about pharmaceutical grade alprazolam powder is it&#039;s solubility issues, it needs to get to the stomach whole for best results. Best method of dosing is, weighed properly of course, and then wrapped in a couple of rollie papers, like an mdma bomb, and washed down with warm water :) It&#039;s not pretty looking, not sure if you&#039;re on selling it, but with rare interesting stuff like that more important it does its job. It is a faster stronger hit than bars, be careful, good luck, AB.

				Use gelcaps, your normal dosage, plus filler. Inform your buyers of what the inactive filler is, and why you did so.

				Me and a mate went through a 100mg bag of alpraz powder without a scale. Only memory I have from that weekend is me and him walking home to my place and me stumbling over car hoods and knocking down rear view mirrors haha. Still, was fun! I think...

				I appreciate all the responses.&nbsp; I handled the package with gloves within the best makeshift laboratory I could convert my apartment to. Having said that, I was having a beer while doing so, occasionally licking my razor blades clean, and it reminded me of why benzos are as amazing as they truly are. Best day I&#039;ve had in a long time. But what I decided to do is split the 500 mg&#039;s ( actually closer to 600, due to the righteousness of Costco), into 100 mg bags, as I can measure that amount accurately, and am going to ask $200/100mg bag for to the clientele. I&#039;d accompany these packages with the disclaimer, &quot;NOT TO BE FUCKED AROUND WITH!!! CONTENTS EQUIVALENT TO 50 BARS!!!&quot;&quot;<br /><br />My question NOW is do y&#039;all think that&#039;s a decent price for the pure alpraz? Or am I cheating myself by not getting a mg scale and splitting them up into gellies? I feel like the price is right, but I also think both packaging methods would be weird in the eyes of the consumer. I wouldn&#039;t charge more than $2 a mg either way, so I&#039;d really rather do 5 transactions than a couple hundred.&nbsp; Does this make any sense to anyone? Am I way off base on this delivery method? And I know that where I&#039;m at in the country, any amount that comes out to under $5 a bar is an excellent deal. Also, all bags are over 100 mg&#039;s. So am I good in all your beautiful people&#039;s professional opinions?<br />Much Love Yall

				&nbsp;Dude, I didn&#039;t suggest you get proper scales to maximise your profit, you need them because providing powerful drugs to people is very dangerous. How do you know your bags weigh 100 mgs? What do your scales register? Scales have a massive range discrepancy for the last percentile they register.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you understand that alprazolam is lipid soluble? You can&#039;t snort the shit, and it doesn&#039;t absorb buccally to any effective degree, so I&#039;m confused how you licking your razor got you high? The licking is also disturbing in its implications. Did you contaminate your product with your oral secretions?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a disclaimer: &quot;THIS GUY&#039;S NOT TO BE FUCKED AROUND WITH!!!! IS NEGLIGIBLE, IGNORANT, AND SOLELY CONCERNED WITH PROFIT&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Dear Aussie Bob.<br />I hope you didn&#039;t hold back,&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in knowing how you really feel about me.<br />Let&#039;s dissect your pompous, self righteous post into it&#039;s most significant components:<br />1.) My scale registers to the thousands, and since you&#039;re are obviously infallible, the weigh the same, at 1.2mg&#039;s, give or take .03 mg. And yeah Aussie, I understand that alrazolam is a powerful drug, or can I just call you Daddy form now on?<br />Moving on to the next douchey assumption.<br /><br />2.) This next paragraph is my favorite.&nbsp; As if I was unaware railing alprazolam is ineffective.&nbsp; And then the piety of Aussie&#039;s assumptions comes to light.&nbsp; Yeah, when I was done with a razor, I licked it.&nbsp; &quot;Done&quot; was the imperative work there, so your paranoia concerning contamination may be a symptom of some kind of delusional assumption disorder you&#039;ve been struggling with.&nbsp; Are you that naive to realize that if you aren&#039;t a moron, licking a razor isn&#039;t dangerous. So call the looney bin, I licked a razor. And yes, I also got high off it despite your assertion its not bucally soluble, Because whits undermy tongue, and I tak a sip of beer, I&#039;m high. Sorry.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;You think you Know too much.<br />&nbsp;<br />I HAVE A DISCLAIMER: THIS DUSE IS A DOUCHEBAG YOU GENERALLY SEE HOLDING SIGNS OF DEAD BABIES AND PROTESTING AGAINST CONDOMS!! DO NOT FUCK AROUND WITH AUSSIE BOB&#039;S CHILDLIKE RETALIATION!! HE JUST THREW HE SAY AND SPEAK AT ME!!<br /><br />Suck my dick you bitch. I was just looking for advice, and when I figured it out, it wasn&#039;t up to your standards you&#039;ve established in your mom&#039;s basement. Go start a blog if all your&#039;e going to do is bitch, I never stole any money from you, so chill the fuck out.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				After all that shit, Aussie Bob was on the money, get the mg scale, sell fat ass weird looking xannies in a rolling paper, and you&#039;re good.&nbsp; Sorry for being an ass Aussie Bob, that&#039;s why my status reads Newbie and yours reads Senior.

				I have found the best way to deal with Alp powder is to mix it with Everclear alcohol, must be 90 proof, fuck isopropyl&nbsp; alcohol or any other shit. Turn it to liquid form. I am trying to finish the&nbsp; 2nd gram I bought 6 months ago. The shit goes a long ways. Anyways, if you got the bag split in 100mg lots, just put 100mg in a small vial or bottle that&#039;s leak-proof and add 1 ml THATS (milliliter) of Everclear to the 100 mg (milligrams) of Alp. I use a syringe from and old ink jet printer refill kit that I sterilized to measure the Everclear. Hold the vial or bottle against a light bulb for a few minutes until it feels warm to touch and shake it up. If it isn&#039;t fully dissolved and you see particles,&nbsp; repeat process. The powder should fully dissolve from 160 to 180 degrees. When it&#039;s liquid suck it back up into the syringe.Before hand you should count how many&nbsp; drops&nbsp; come out of 1 ml of liqiud from your syringe. Then do the math. Dispense it&nbsp; drop by drop onto a candy or some form of paper, Ive used everything from small squares of rolling papers with the gum edge cut off&nbsp; to plain paper towel squares. Also used different&nbsp; candies that will hold the liquid without losing their color or shape. Experiment. But be safe. Hope this helps.

				I agree with white1. If you have it completely dissolved in liquid (propylene glycol or strong ethanol does the trick), dosing is much easier. It is not really trivial to mix it equally with an inert filler and distribute over caps - if density or particle size distribution is not equal, you risk getting VERY different amounts of active drug in each capsule.

				Damn White1.&nbsp; That&#039;s some good advice.&nbsp; Ive got the bit I had already split up, not as accurately as your method would have rendered it, but close enough to be safe.&nbsp; And as good as those instructions are, I&#039;m not dealing with that batch again.&nbsp; It is what it is at this point, and I&#039;m not opening those again.&nbsp; But next time, I&#039;m with you White1.&nbsp; I really appreciate it.

				If you don&#039;t have a scale good enough to weigh out a dose of something, you&#039;ve got no business dealing that dose to people. <br /><br />Shit&#039;s going to end badly for them, and for you shortly afterwards.

				My advice on a good milligram scale is from The Digital Guy on ebay.Good quality and warranty for about$70.00.It comes with a 10 year warranty. Believe it s an AWS GPR 20 better than those 20$ ones from China. Before I had a syringe to measure everclear I just used those small plastic cups that come on cough medicine like Nyquil or robotussein. they have the liquid ml (milliliter ) marks for measuring the everclear, A person just has to work quick with evaporation rates of highproof liquor.I have tried making blotters a few month back with fancy art work on them. Not good the everclear just fades out and washhes away the beautiful artwork.Looked badand did&#039;t hold much liquid alp,
