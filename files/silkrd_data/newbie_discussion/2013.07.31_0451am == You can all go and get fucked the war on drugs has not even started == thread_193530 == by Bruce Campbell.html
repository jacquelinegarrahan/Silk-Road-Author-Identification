				You watch; one day soon it&#039;ll be all over the news. They&#039;re gonna make a public spectacle of a vendor or two with buyers involved as well. Will have to chalk that up as another victory in the war on drugs! Think about it. They need it. I just hope i&#039;m not involved! Yikes!

Your account got banned, and the people whose addresses you have didnt do anything wrong. In fact they supported your ass by buying your drugs so you could make a profit. I am glad Silk Road banned you its clear you deserve it. I would never join forces with the police for any reason. I will always protect my customers as well. Even though I have had a bad customer or 2 I will always remember the 100+ amazing customers I had. The people at Silk Road are great people, yea there are a few dicks, but Ive never had the pleasure of meeting such a wide variety of intelligent good people. <br /><br />You deserve the worst life has to give. I wouldnt support LE in anyway no matter what but I would buy some bullets for all of your enemies for free.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^^This guy^^<br /><br />Is sketchy as fuck!!<br />Check the vendor account. - No activity for 3 months, now just cashing out bitcoins. - No more BenZo&#039;s like he used to do 3 months ago. Suddenly he&#039;s back but as a bitcoin vendor? - It all may be fine, but he&#039;s only been doing it for 4 or 5 days. <br /><br />This guys responsible for getting Bruce Campbell suspended. - If you research what happened, you&#039;ll see that BruceCampbell did no such thing. Did he break a few technicalities on the order of a broken tail light, and a loud muffler? Yes. Did he comprimise buyers address&#039;s ? Hell no!<br />Read the facts before you say shit based upon what some other asshole wrote on forums. Use your heads. Dummies~! &gt;:(<br /><br />Mods should delete this thread. It&#039;s just spreading misinformation. <br />I think BruceCampbell the real one, has suffered more than enough already, unnecessarily.
