				I&#039;m growing more and more interested in the 2c-x&#039;s as well as all the other variations I&#039;ve started to notice recently (3c&#039;s 2c-t&#039;s ect.) So far, I only have experience with 2ci. I&#039;m interested in trying 2ce next but I really want to hear some people&#039;s experiences and thoughts on differences and simillarites between all the different 2c&#039;s. Also, I think it would be awesome if someone started selling sample packs with multiple variations 2c&#039;s. I for one would be interested in buying a gram of half 2ci and half 2ce to avoid paying two separate shipping costs, but I digress.

				I have a little experience with 2c-x&#039;s. I&#039;ve had b on a few occasions, i twice and loads of e. For me b was really superficial as a psychedelic. It was lots of fun though, like a night out type of drug. The i was a out the same, only more visual, but still pretty shallow. 2c-e was, and still is, my favorite 2c. It is capable of depth, offers stunning visuals, and has a very nice body load until you get into heroic doses. The highest up I&#039;ve gone was 45 mgs and it was very intense. Completely immersive. The body load was at the border of being unmanageable though. Shivers, leg tremors, severe uncoordination. I enjoyed it thoroughly though. I imagine an i/e or b/e combo would be nice. I&#039;ve only mixed it with m1 and psilocetin and both were amazing.

				&nbsp;::) ::) ::) ::) ::)<br />2CB, 2CI, 2CE, 2CT7, love them all, but 2CB and I are def my favorites.&nbsp; The body load isn&#039;t as intense as the latter two i&#039;ve tried.&nbsp; I have had extensive experiences on these compounds, it was nice when you could procure these over the clearnet easily.&nbsp; If you are interested in experimenting w/ the 2c series, I would suggest 2CB and I for starters.&nbsp; The other two are totally different in dosage and intoxication.&nbsp;
