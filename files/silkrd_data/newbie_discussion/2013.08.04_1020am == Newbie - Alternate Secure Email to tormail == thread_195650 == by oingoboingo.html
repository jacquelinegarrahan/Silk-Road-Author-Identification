				Hey everyone, this is my first post...I am green as green with this stuff and may have a few (possible dumb) questions, please bear with me. :P<br /><br />I was wondering if there were any other secure mail providers out there instead of tormail, tormail has been unreliable all weekend and I want to create a secure email before doing a PGP Public Key thingy (havent worked that one out yet either...but I&#039;m taking this one step at a time).<br /><br />Also...do you think it wise to setup a bitcoin wallet separate from SR or can you just get the agent to deposit straight into my SR account? <br /><br />My brain is hurting from all this new info to take in!<br /><br />I&#039;ll get there eventually, thanks in advance!<br /><br />Oingo<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				oingoboingo, first great name. <br />&nbsp;i&#039;m a noob aswell, so take this all the salt you can find. i think riseup.net might help your mail.<br />from what i&#039;ve seen on the forums its wise to tumble your btc before putting it in sr, unless you bought anonyously i guess.<br />also think you want to just put in enough in your sr account to cover your order. idk why but thats what i saw.<br />if you need pratice with pgp i will help or go to the pgp club thread.

				Thanks Alutnarat,<br />Good Advice that I&#039;ll definitely take on board. I think I&#039;ll be getting bitcoins anonymously for a start.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try riseup.net I think.<br /><br />Thanks again

				riseup.net are great, but note that you don&#039;t need an email account to do PGP, or anything on SR. One can be useful in case it goes down, though.<br /><br />The recommendation to only put as many bitcoins as you need for an order in your SR account are so that if it gets compromised, you won&#039;t lose extra money which is sitting there. Which is a good reason to have your own bitcoin wallet, that you deposit some of into the silkroad wallet when you need to.

				There is quite a bit of chatter on the Forum about e-mail / communication &amp; reliability over Tor.&nbsp; I suggest that you go to the main page of the forum, and then use the Search function to peruse the site for information. <br /><br />There is, IMO, no real reason for you to need to include a valid e-mail address into your pgp public key.&nbsp; As I see it, the protocol just allows you to enter an e-mail address into it, possibly for convenience&#039;s sake... But it is not necessary.&nbsp; Who would you use that pgp key with that does not use SR?&nbsp; Unless the road goes down, of course...&nbsp; And you can always make more public keys. easy peasy<br /><br />And yes, I would probably set up at least one other bit coin wallet aside from your SR account.&nbsp; Check out bitcoinfog for tumbling...
