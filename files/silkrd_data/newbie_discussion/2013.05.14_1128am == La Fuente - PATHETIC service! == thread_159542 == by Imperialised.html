				Just thought id post a message here to discourage anyone that may be contemplating buying from La Fuente<br /><br />I placed an order for an oz of his &#039;Premium Sativa&#039; 4 days ago now<br /><br />4 days later, he has neither accepted or rejected my order, nor have I heard a single word from him<br /><br />To describe his service as pathetic is actually a compliment - I mean, referring to it as pathetic at least implies that I had some service - but I haven&#039;t... not a scrap!<br /><br />And I know he&#039;s been online, because some of the information in his listings has changed<br /><br />Basically my coins that were sent to him to pay for the transaction have been locked up for the past 4 days, with me being powerless to do anything about it. I am able to cancel my order in around 7 hours, to receive a refund. But still, this really inst acceptable. Because the transaction was &#039;hedged&#039; I will automatically lose 5% of my money and due to the bitcoin rate constantly fluctuating, I am never going to get the same amount back that I sent, after 4 days have passed<br /><br />After I placed my order i headed over here to have a look around and I read lots of discouraging stuff about him, which was worrying.... not sending out packages, total ignorance and failure to reply to messages, selective scamming, arrogance, basically a real asshole to order/have ordered from<br /><br />From reading his listings he seemed to be a reasonably well educated, nice kinda guy, which is why I ordered from him<br /><br />4 days later and it seems that all the bad stuff about him that is floating around here, is true to fact<br /><br />Anyone that is contemplating ordering from him, I would steer well clear

				Hello there Imperialised.<br /><br />Whilst I appreciate you are cross, if you read La Fuente&#039;s vendor page it says:<br /><br />&quot;*******May 10th**********<br />Hey Everyone,<br /><br />We&#039;re a little behind schedule on orders and messages but will get everything caught up next week. Today is Mother&#039;s Day. It&#039;s the third holiday we&#039;ve had this month and general sentiments this time of year are of festivities and family.<br /><br />Saludos,<br />LF&quot;<br /><br />I have ordered from La Fuente and his product, communications and packaging were all A1. I am sure he will conclude your order to your satisfaction given time, as his reputation is excellent. Give him a little more time!

				Maybe you are right, but I did forget to mention that, after my order, he altered the listing to state that he no longer shipped to my country... or at least I think he did. I mean, his listing states this:<br /><br />&quot;This item does not ship to Scotland or England.&quot;<br /><br />and a few lines down:<br /><br />&quot;This item does not ship to Australia.<br /><br />Buyers in Canada and the UK: Please allow one week for your order(s) to be shipped.&quot;<br /><br />Also, I can&#039;t seem to find the thread that I was referring to, with all the negativity about him, but it was pretty bad<br /><br />And even if he does have a backlog... 4 full days to process it and still not so much as a word? No man, Far too much time imo. Theres no way he has THAT much of a backlog. That, combined with the misleading listings, lots of bad rep as a scammer and selective cheat in the forum is just too much for me and, even considering your point, I would still recommend people stay clear of him

				Your conclusion does seem somewhat hasty. His feedback speaks for itself. Bear in mind his product is respected and is the cheapest on the site, which will naturally have its detractors.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why you would order from a vendor who stated they no longer delivered to your country. If that is the case I expect he may not get round to you first. Still, I&#039;d be very surprised if he did not resolve this eventually.

				<br />I Looked him over a few days ago and passed just because of his rules regarding new buyers. If I&#039;m not mistaken, he either requires FE if you have fewer than five purchases under your belt, or he won&#039;t sell to you at all. Besides, if I want cheap Mexican brick weed, there&#039;s enough of that crap floating around here anyway. The weed that floats around here SUCKS, even the stuff they charge $125.00 a quarter for.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never bought from LaFuente and most likely won&#039;t. I got a bad vibe just looking over his seller page. That&#039;s nothing against him, just saying I wasn&#039;t comfortable placing an order there myself. And I think he ships from Mexico. No thanks!

				I was looking at his feedback score yesterday and it was listed at 57%, anyone else notice this?<br /><br />Now it&#039;s at 93%, which I usually think is low, but he is in the top 3% of vendors based on the volume of orders I&#039;m guessing?<br /><br />Sorry bout your troubles OP.

				That was probably just a glitch a glitch on the system, Trennbar. His stats are around 93<br /><br />To be honest this particular thing&nbsp; with Fuente for me isn&#039;t a great problem or worry. I have approximately 1 more hour to wait, until I can click the &#039;cancel&#039; button and get nearly all of my coins back (minus 5% and a little due to coin fluctuation, which im not really too fussed about)<br /><br />And I would actually prefer that at the moment, than the other possibility of him having replied to me, saying he was going to send the order and then me having to wait weeks, worrying whether the package was going to arrive or not and in fact, whether it had even been sent or not. The only shipping option at the time of my purchase, was non tracked and I was required by his policy to FE... so really not a good spot for me to be in, considering his current reputation around here<br /><br />I&#039;m just glad it wasn&#039;t a massive purchase and to be honest, like i say, I am glad that this has happened and that he hasn&#039;t accepted my order and that very soon I will have chance to cancel it,&nbsp; suffer a minimal loss and place another order with a much safer and more reputable vendor<br /><br />It is a shame because his prices are literally the best on SR, no-one else comes near him. Maybe some people are and will continue to be happy with him. But I know many certainly are not and I would never place an order with him again, thats for sure

				You should check out the UK Cannabis Buyers thread in the rumour mill. A lot of UK orders from LF had gone awry with various outcomes. <br /><br />Think you&#039;ll find the main discussion from page 60 onwards&nbsp; ;) Pretty sure at least one buyer got a customs letter, some others got after a very long wait whilst others gave up all hope.<br /><br />Hope you get it sorted!<br /><br />

				He&#039;s one of the biggest vendors on SR so it excuses his bad communication. It&#039;s the price you pay for the significant monetary savings you make compared with any other vendor. It took 23 days to get to UK for me. I&#039;ve noticed that my messages haven&#039;t even been read but it arrived safe and sound.<br /><br />Brilliant service, bad communication.

				I just took a quick look at Fuentes profile<br /><br />Heres a feedback hes recently received:<br /><br />&quot;Refunded after waiting FOUR MONTHS. Lied about shipping date 3 times. His prices are amazing but I&#039;ve always been told &quot;If it&#039;s too good to be true, than it probably is&quot;<br />If you order from him and it comes through, I suggest you go out and buy a lottery ticket that same day.<br />The very first refund on my account, and he&#039;s given me two of them, THANKS LF&quot;<br /><br />Obviously that was a negative review, but even this next one, which is strangely a 5/5 positive review, sounds terrible:<br /><br />&quot;My 3rd order from LF, arrived perfectly. Took 29 (working+non-working) days, better than expected. My last order took over 40 days to arrive; I was a little bit surprised to find my weed in the mail box today.&quot;<br /><br />Fuente is going nowhere, FAST<br /><br />It wont be long until he can&#039;t give his products away for free. You simply cannot run a business like he does

Quite simply - it isnt<br /><br />I guarantee that Fuente will not be able to trade for much longer, unless he sharpens up his act. He cannot and will not continue to trade if he continues to treat his customers the way he does. His reputation will continue to get slammed, his feedback score will continue to drop, the people that have had bad experiences with him will never go back, the ever increasing amount of new members arriving at SR will only see his bad reviews and negative feedback and will not go near him<br /><br />This isnt an opinion or prediction, it is logic and common sense and will without doubt happen<br />

				well.. that&#039;s a good question. what i dont like in LF is his lack of communication, and the time to the order arrive. usually, its like 7-15 days to E.U. LF has recent feedbacks saying that it taked 20days to arrive.. not so mutch. the stealth, usually his feedbacks dont complain about it. LF is not a guy that i would buy all my weed.. but i wanted to try it, low prices and it seems good weed, so i&#039;m here trying it :)

Dont get me wrong, I am not accusing Fuente of being an out and out scammer - he clearly isnt that. A selective sammer? Maybe. But even so, many of the major negatives about him and the service that he provides, that are detailed in this thread, are all true and I think people need to know about them, before (like I did) they make a purchase and find out the hard way<br /><br />Luckily I got out of the deal relatively unscathed, but I know many people havent been so lucky and if I would have known before I placed the order, what I now know about him, I would never have tried to do business with him in the first place<br /><br />Hopefully this thread presents useful information about Fuente, that any possible customers of his can take into consideration before they send him their money

				Since he states in his listings, that all his weed is pressed and basically ruined before shipment, I never fancied his weed at all<br /><br />His new &#039;premium&#039; listing did appeal to me as he stated that this weed would not be pressed an that nice, fluffy buds would be received<br /><br />But as explained in this thread, ordering and receiving it is somewhat of a problem and difficulty due to the nature of Fuentes attitude towards and total lack of respect for his customers<br /><br />Basically, its like a roll of the dice and that for me, is far from good enough

I ordered a qp from la fuente on the 1st of march and he marked in in transit on the 14th! Ive been messaging him the whole entire month and not 1 response. I opted for an extension,and bam,he responds to that but not my messages. So about a week ago I ask for a refund for my resolution and typed if you cant even show me my tracking number after a month,I want a fucking refund. He pops up that day and says oh your order was shipped in the 27th and on the 1st of april!!! It took him a fucking month before he even sent out my package! Can you fucking believe it? He probably sent me a magazine with new tracking numbers to shut me up. This guy really is fuckin pissing me off now,and again,wont respond to a damn thing. If sr staff knows about this,will they give me a refund? Not even shiping a product after 1 month??? I would want double my fucking order for the inconvenience,and la fuente acts really cool about this. Doesnt matter my 4oo bucks has been in limbo for a fucking month plus,and have been checking the mail every day. The one tracking number says preparing to dispatch still and the other doesnt even show valid yet. This guy is a fucking asshole people,sorry for more bad news. So hes not shipping out peoples shit for sometimes not even a month! Even when he marked it in transit,that was already 2 weeks late! Im putting in a new resolution.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The guys an ignorant, piss-taking, lying, asshole... pure and simple

				You are one of the pricks making his vending life hard. People like you disgust me. You want drugs and you get them, yet you scam poor guys like LF. I ordered 7 times from him, each order took its time but it arrived in the end. He even did two reships on a 125g order. I bugged him a bit to hand me out the tracking numbers and I got them so I could see that he sent those packages for real.<br />It wasn&#039;t his fault, the package just got seized.<br />Be happy that LF gives you a reply within a week. Things need time and what he is doing is a monsterous logistic task. I respect him for doing it and doing it so cheap. <br />Anyways OP go fuck yourself and leave that poor vendor alone.

				You must be patient with our Mexican vendor. If you want it cheap and you can wait up to a month for Mexican Post then LF is a good choice. If you want it fast, you must source locally. Of course that would cost more. You must be patient. He even stated that he would be be available. Make certain to read the vendor page before you close out the cart!&nbsp; 8)

He accepted my first request of an extension so I don&#039;t see why he wouldn&#039;t this time.

				Ah yeah if he proves he sent it and it gets seized then the most likely outcome is 50% refund. I&#039;ve got a good feeling it&#039;s gonna get through customs though - my guess is they seized one of his packages by chance and then checked similar looking packaging, which is why a lot got intercepted like 4-6 weeks ago so he&#039;s gonna have change up or something like that.

				He&#039;ll still have plenty of people willing to buy from him as long as he continues to offer these prices. He had a rating of 91 or something when I first came across him, I did some research and figured his ratings are low because he takes a long time to ship and reply to messages, which I&#039;m more than happy to put up with for those prices. I don&#039;t see any reason why others won&#039;t continue to do this.

It would be nice if he wasn&#039;t so erratic with his timescales and such - it is undeniably frustrating that I&#039;ve been waiting over 2 weeks for a tracking number (my heart breaks each morning I wake up and &quot;messages: 0&quot; but I&#039;m willing to tolerate that for the prices. He probably knows that people will keep coming back no matter what as long as he&#039;s this cheap, too.

				I´m starting to think Lafuente is a selective scammer too. No reply to my message in 10 days, ordered 125gr weed around 25th april. Now I have postponed the order for sativa weed because I don´t think he shipped my orders. A shame cause I got my first oz but I guess u live and learn. I´m from Denmark, Europe btw. when I received an oz it got here not signed for within a month

				Hi all,<br /><br />I ordered twice at his shop and evt. got every order entirely. <br />C= I had to wait approx 1,5 wks until dispatch. Then waited 15 days until I put the order into RC. It got extended. He served me a load of crap as an excuse. I made fun out of him. He shipped express with tracking to &quot;make it up&quot;. I got my stuff, which was good, but not outstanding. It was cut with something hydrophobic resulting in a clogged nose. And I waited 35 days. <br />Weed= 4 parcels were shipped in total, two parcels, were shipped to the UK, where I don&#039;t reside. He reshipped them to my drop, providing tracking.<br /><br />Especially for the C order I was convinced he tried to scam me. He just waits that you &quot;FE before autofinalization&quot;. His page is full of that feedback.<br />After I finally got everything, I don&#039;t remember how long that took, I was relieved not having to deal with his vending anymore. And I really felt bad for everyone who FE&#039;d, during his 420 sale for instance.<br /><br />I never felt he was reliable. He contradicted himself exposing himself as a liar, stating he was a one man operation (don&#039;t remember where, though), while PMing his packer fucked up.<br /><br />I believe there is more to it than just bad service. I don&#039;t know his sales volumes, but I guess other vendors handle those without raising that much suspicion to the community.<br /><br />Cheers.<br />Jason

All tracking proves is &#039;something&#039; has been &#039;sent&#039; from &#039;somewhere&#039;, it could be &#039;anything&#039; going to &#039;anywhere&#039; within it&#039;s destination country. As far as I&#039;m aware the destination address can not be viewed online when a package is tracked via a tracking number, only it&#039;s destination country. When the tracked item (whether it be parcel or letter) reaches it&#039;s destination country, it goes through the process of customs clearance, then regional and local sorting offices respectably before arriving at it&#039;s final destination. It&#039;s possible LF has not sent coke or weed at all, rather a dud package with the right street and postal/zip code, but (and here&#039;s the stinger) providing a door number that doesn&#039;t exist, deceiving his customers and giving them the impression their orders have been dispatched, when in fact, nothing has been sent to them at all. Of course, this theory will never be proved or debunked as nobody will be prepared to disclose their tracking numbers with good and obvious reason, however with the amount of no shows, I can&#039;t help wonder if this has been the case, ever since the reports of LF&#039;s &#039;lost orders&#039; first surfaced, which have been consistently happening for many months, but more prolifically since he decided to exclusively list bulk quantities of coke and weed, I guess we&#039;ll never know. I encourage everyone who has an outstanding order presently with LF, and has missed the deadline for arrival by a significant amount of time, to submit a resolution to the resolution center. <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159542.msg1258403#msg1258403">Quote from: godness420 on June 20, 2013, 07:03 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You really are the &quot;MAD mike &quot; so many rage on that post. you better jack off<br /><br />and btw. &quot;I went to customer support after a week of being in processing &quot;<br /><br />wat? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> goodness420 it&#039;s okay for you, you&#039;ve received your order, furthermore you&#039;re the only person who has received in months, consider yourself the &#039;lucky one&#039;. Mad Mike has every right to vent, I&#039;m sure you&#039;d be venting here too if you were part of the vast majority who are still waiting for their order. Mad Mike is well within his right to cancel his order after a week, SilkRoad gives a four day window for an order to be marked &#039;in transit&#039;, if the vendor fails to meet this time frame, the buyer can make a request to the resolution center for a full refund. No matter how busy a vendor is, four days is more than enough time to process, pack, and post an order (the top 5% vendors I&#039;ve ordered from have marked my order &#039;in transit&#039; in under forty eight hours). If the vendor fails to meet this time frame, the vendor should inform the buyer, that&#039;s something called common courtesy, a practice any business that&#039;s worth it&#039;s salt employs. I&#039;ve gathered from reading the feedback on this review page and the feedback on his vendor&#039;s page, common courtesy is something that&#039;s very UNcommon with LF, in fact he&#039;s very discourteous towards his customers and treats them in a way that is simply unacceptable for a professional vendor. Is this the kind of vendor who should vending on SilkRoad? In my honest opinion... <br /><br />¡¡¡No!!!

Too bad he didn&#039;t put his username and a link to thread next to the feedback, for me dumbass to understand who wrote this and why.

You got me shivering in fear. Is it comfy behind your screen? Awesome how you served madmike earlier on as well. I&#039;m sure you lick balls of each hero member, though. From what I understand (which is little, you&#039;re right), I&#039;m still 100% positive you do have a penis matching to the size of your temper. Fuck is this unfair, why can&#039;t I be as awesome as you? <br /><br />Is there any intel Fuente is tipping of the police? Did I miss something? To me it just looks as if customs intercepted the parcel. Which is bad enough for this poor soul, obviously.<br />&nbsp;<br />Edit: -1 ? I made a point, as it seems.

Your choice of words suggests that you were thinking, it might have been the actual sending. What feedback did you leave? Lemme guess 5/5 seized by customs, better luck next time. <br /><br />If you look at my review above I had two envelopes of four missing. Actually, now that I remember, he stated he sent two in one, This one didn&#039;t show. It was the first one sent. So what? <br />First one goes missing, that&#039;s bad, oh here is one, and here another one. This must have been bad luck, as I got those, sorry I doubted you Fuente.<br />Except I asked him to reship in split parcels, as it never arrived in my country, which he did. Again, what a hero!<br /><br />Investing time in bogus custom intercepted parcels + carefully and meticulously playing mindtricks, this one is a vicious fucker &quot;supposedly&quot;<br />Unfortunately the mail he sent me to justify why he didn&#039;t ship my C (1-2 days before autofinalizing) got flushed. <br />You guys remember his feedback page? F/E before autofinalize I&#039;ll ask the mods about it once whilst I report him. It was really good fun.<br />&nbsp;

They would never make it through without some verifications.<br /><br />But it is just as doubtful to have an envelope with 2oz going awol, without getting a notification of seizure, and 4 follow up envelopes make it through to the very same drop a couple of weeks later. This happened to me. <br /><br />Maybe my logic was a bit far fetched so let&#039;s keep it simple then: there is most definitely something going on with this vendor. It has been said earlier on in that post. And whatever it is, it&#039;s not as some plain and simple as him keeping the money without sending. Not Tony, not enter the matrix.<br /><br />And you made a good point Jack concerning that bogus interceptions, I mean the packaging part of it, but you can&#039;t dismiss it all together, for one can fake a custom interceptions or a lost parcel with a mere tracking number. And it would cost you only as much as the international postage is worth.<br /><br />So I won&#039;t risk into speculations anymore, but would still like everyone who considers buying at Fuentes tienda, to be aware that the is something sketchy going on. <br />Don&#039;t FE, order only if you can afford to loose 50% of the price and a bump to your buyers stats.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Edit: I still think it&#039;s cheaper to invest in packaging material required for bogus parcels than to ship all the weed. This vendor has very high sale volumes. I&#039;m not saying he did. <br /><br />Peace out <br />Jason<br />

Clearly he isn&#039;t making enough effort to give his customers good service, as is borne out by his overall rating being 79 but that&#039;s not to say he&#039;s scamming anyone. I could be wrong about the Mexican post, I&#039;m only basing what I said about their proficiency on hearsay. But as Jack N Hoff said, he&#039;s STILL sending a fuckload of weed from one of, if not THE the most notorious nation on Earth for drug dealing. Add to that, a lot of his customers are European, and there can&#039;t be very much post sent from Mexico to Europe so it&#039;s not really that strange a lot of his shit is getting seized.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to defend him to virulently, not replying to messages for over a month is really shitty and all.

Did you ever read any review about it?<br />You do realize that when you pull a listing, the feedback is not displayed?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The sativa weed no, I don&#039;t think I have. But the 420 weed, yes. A lot of people finalised early for that so you have to go back a fair bit to see their feedback, but there are two on the first page of his feedback ATM - are you sure that&#039;s true that feedback for old listings gets pulled? Granted, both of them say it didn&#039;t arrive but he definitely sent mine and if you go back further you&#039;ll see people saying they got theirs.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> But don&#039;t you think it&#039;s odd that given the fact that a month into vending all those issues where well known to him and his sales were yet to peak, he never got a grip on logistics? So what would be the reason for that? The other vendors manage, don&#039;t they?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, as you said, his sales hadn&#039;t peaked. Clearly he isn&#039;t making enough effort to give his customers good service, as is borne out by his overall rating being 79 but that&#039;s not to say he&#039;s scamming anyone. I could be wrong about the Mexican post, I&#039;m only basing what I said about their proficiency on hearsay. But as Jack N Hoff said, he&#039;s STILL sending a fuckload of weed from one of, if not THE the most notorious nation on Earth for drug dealing. Add to that, a lot of his customers are European, and there can&#039;t be very much post sent from Mexico to Europe so it&#039;s not really that strange a lot of his shit is getting seized.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to defend him to virulently, not replying to messages for over a month is really shitty and all.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jeez. Ok he&#039;s a bad vendor and doesn&#039;t give a rats ass improving on well know issues he has with logistics since day one. He thanks you for his support, as he doesn&#039;t even have to come out the bush to defend himself, poorly, if you consider last time he did in the forum or on his vendor page. <br />It&#039;s about not scamming it&#039;s : labour day, him having a few days off and all the rest of the BS he write on his profile. That and loads of bad luck. Continuous bad luck. <br />Good luck than if you order from Fuente. My previous comment applies: don&#039;t FE order only if you can take a bump to your stats and a 50% loss (que mala suerte esta vez, pero gracias por el dinerito).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Peace out

Why you feel the need to be rude and confrontational I don&#039;t know.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />- I&#039;m not claiming he&#039;s making fake custom letters. I misread a post and sorted that above. I wish to make people aware, that is possible to use tracking such as one might think the package was snagged. I&#039;m not saying he does, I&#039;m saying he could.<br /><br />- You do realize you couldn&#039;t answer a single question convincingly? <br />* No sativa feedback, no reviews: the other 420 orders are coming and I got mine, there are some that say it didn&#039;t arrive.<br />* He had logistic problems even before the sale figure rose, other vendors do not : mexican post is crap + customs snag it<br /><br />If the listing is down, the feedback get pulled. The rating is integrated into overall vendor rating.<br />Mexican post isn&#039;t that bad I got mine in no time 3 times, yours got so far customs could snag it. I&#039;m not denying it&#039;s tough getting post customs from such a flagged country. I didn&#039;t even bring it up or mention it. Yes, there are threads of guys getting busted from Fuentes weed. Customs wizened up, sure. <br /><br />Be sure of one thing: the only plausible explanation about how everything about his operation is a fuckup is not that he&#039;s a slob, has poor support from mexican post, is unlucky with customs, experiences setbacks due to his computer burning, experiences delays because of labour day and so on.<br />The only explanation for all this is he scams.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if I sounded rude. Is it the use of coarse language such as &quot;rats ass, BS, calling the lord Jeez&quot; ? Read again. I&#039;m not being rude to anyone. This gets me heated. Jack statement my thinking is delusional would be, given the fact he prolly didn&#039;t take his time to read this thread, any other thread on Fuente, or any of my other post. Nor did he order from Fuente. The statement I made about fake custom interceptions was clearly false, I retracted. Still I see how you can make people believe they&#039;ve been intercepted. And it would&#039;t imply sending weed.<br /><br />Why I&#039;m confrontational? This happens when people don&#039;t agree. This is a statement usually expressed by the party running out of arguments, so to create sympathy for their cause, making the advocate of the other opinion an harassor.<br /><br />It&#039;s cool it worked out all fine for you with Fuente. It did with me, too. But it doesn&#039;t for 60% of the other customers, according to his feedback. And I don&#039;t buy it&#039;s just bad luck or, no envy to improve on crappy logistics (which is know since he was a month into vending).<br /><br />Peace out.<br />Again, sorry if I offended you. You will from time to time hear a few f-words, swearing and profanity in here.<br /><br />Peace out <br />Jason<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

From my understanding, if a listing gets pulled, the feedback goes along. You made me doubt. We can agree on &#039;there is no feedback or review for the sativa to our knowledge.&#039; And apparently both read a fair bit.<br />If I recall correctly, he kept the same listings for 420, doubled the qty and requiered FE. Which would explain the feedback if I&#039;m right. <br /><br />2. There is one guy saying he got scammed every other page. Than you have these guys who finalize before going into resolution, dunno why, but there&#039;s plenty. You are right that some people get their packages. This to me, looks exactly like selectively scamming. Some get, some don&#039;t. <br /><br />3. I&#039;ll refrase that into: you don&#039;t have a clue what it means. I don&#039;t recall too well neither, i must concede. :) You do realize it is totally irrelevant in regard to the points I was making? Forget it, you got me. Nice PR.&nbsp; <br />Blasphemy is a sin amongst us law abiding citizen. <br /><br />Peace out <br />Jason.

				He finally wrote me back after my comment in here. I don´t believe he shipped it in the first place, but he answered me and told me that he missed my order and after I wrote my address he would reship my order. 3 weeks tops to Scandinavia and I got santas magic bag, no problem. I ordered the sativa too but as I didn´t hear from him an admin released my money so I got 100% refund which was nice. And of course when lafuente didn´t answer me I guess the admin didn´t have a choice. No complaints from lafuente either so all is good with me.<br />If he came on as a vendor again I would give ham another chance for sure, as I havent lost any money on him and even though the service could have been alot better, I still received my 1 oz and santas magic bag which was at least 10gr overweight, maybe to compensate for forgetting my order:)
