				So I&#039;m interested in venturing beyond the worlds of bud and speed, and have always wanted to try psycedlics. I&#039;m particularly interested in giving shrooms a shot. Having never done them before, I&#039;d love any advice those with experience can offer.<br /><br />1) Which psycedelic do you recommend for first time user? Why or why not?<br />2) What dosage do you recommend for first time user?<br />3) What time of safety precautions do I need to take? i.e., babysitter, lock myself in a room, etc.?<br />4) Any advice on how to create an ideal setting for my first experience? I don&#039;t want it to be anxious or scary...so what can be done to avoid that?<br />5) Any recommendations for other drugs to mix with it? For example: &quot;eat Xg of shrooms, wait 20min and smoke some bud&quot;<br /><br />Thanks in advance SR!

				&nbsp; I&#039;d stick with the well known ones if your&#039;e concerned. Like a hit of acid, or some shrooms. Atleast you have the peace of mind that it&#039;s relatively safe unless you have some underlying mental issues or something.<br />&nbsp; The most important is to be in a good mindset, and comfortable surroundings. Bud mixes well among others. But good for starters. I always smoked right after the peak and it would bring out the visuals (which you will need a crutch taking a small dose).

				These affect everyone differently, so all I can do is give advice based on my own experiences. My first was shrooms and I loved them. I ate 3.5g. By SR standards it was probably 1.5-2.5g. <br /><br />I would definitely have a sitter your first time, preferably one who has tripped before. That way they can back off and know when you&#039;re just tripping or when you actually need help with something.<br /><br />For a setting, just be comfortable. That&#039;s pretty vague, but prepare for what you think you might want to do and set it up so it&#039;s as simple as possible, like having trippy videos ready to go in your dvd player or your favorite music one button away. It&#039;s one of the most frustrating things when you&#039;re tripping hard and really want to do something but you/re too confused to perform basic tasks like grabbing a cd and putting in into a player and getting it to play. Honestly though, your trip will take over and dictate the game plan, so you might not even do anything you prepare for anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only mixed once, and that was with MDMA. I watched other people play Geometry Wars and it gave me the most intense visual experience I&#039;ve ever had. It was intense in such a wonderful way. Towards the middle/end of my trips, I smoke a LOT of weed nonstop. It feels like you can hit it forever and it tastes so good. <br /><br />As for dosage, I think I would prefer to be underwhelmed my first time than overwhelmed. Start small and you&#039;ll have a gauge as to how it was, then adjust accordingly. <br /><br />Have fun!<br /><br />

				I&#039;d start with a lighter dose of shrooms...usually take about 3 or 4 grams for a good trip, but on first use I would try a couple of grams...at least that is how I began. Just wanted to see<br />how I would tolerate them before going full dose. Then move up to some acid eventually.<br /><br />Always be safe, have a sober friend to sit with you to keep you safe and offer support. Keep in mind mood is very important when using these types of drugs. A relaxing<br />quiet, atmosphere is ideal.<br /><br />Be safe, enjoy the trip!<br /><br />Peace

				I&#039;ll try and give the best advice I can based on my opinion, but it is only my opinion, you&#039;ll find answers to this question will vary drastically:<br /><br />1) Which psycedelic do you recommend for first time user? Why or why not?<br /><br />LSD. I say so because it&#039;s my preferred and there&#039;s such a history to it.<br /><br />2) What dosage do you recommend for first time user?<br /><br />It depends on what you are looking for. If you decide to choose LSD you could read Stanislav Grof&#039;s book on it&#039;s use in psychedelic therapy and the dosages they used.<br /><br />God, sorry I digress. I personally would dose 1 tablet rated at 100-120ug. The dosage will never be accurate. If after a two hours (do others agree with this length of time) you aren&#039;t getting there then you can redose to increase the effect.<br /><br />3) What time of safety precautions do I need to take? i.e., babysitter, lock myself in a room, etc.?<br /><br />If you can have a sitter that would be ideal. Again it all depends on what you want. Tripping with other people can be profound,..so can tripping alone. It sounds like you&#039;ll be tripping alone so my advice is to have someone close by, who knows what you&#039;re doing and knows to come to you if you call. Some people prefer sitters physically with them but I don&#039;t like this, makes me nervous. If you live in a large house then they could be in another room (I just live in a one bed apartment so,..)<br /><br />4) Any advice on how to create an ideal setting for my first experience? I don&#039;t want it to be anxious or scary...so what can be done to avoid that?<br /><br />Set and setting are of 99% importance in psychedelic experiments. Don&#039;t go or plan to do anything that would normally induce anxiety/fear. Stay to places that are safe. Have a sober companion. It&#039;s hard to sway without the specific circumstances.<br /><br />5) Any recommendations for other drugs to mix with it? For example: &quot;eat Xg of shrooms, wait 20min and smoke some bud&quot;<br /><br />I can&#039;t give recommendations on buzz increases (but I smoke through mine sometimes - it&#039;s goooood). Obviously there&#039;s candy-flipping.<br /><br />If you have some Xanax/Diazepam/Klonopin etc., to hand then make sure you keep them with you. If it becomes too intense then they will take the edge off.<br /><br />Good luck, hope other people can help you out as well :)

				LSD might be to complicated for your first experience, i would recommend you some 2C-B.<br />It is psychedelic, but keeps you more grounded... LSD goes deeper down your unconsciousness, 2cb is imho easier to control

				I would take 4-aco-dmt. With mushrooms your dose depends on the genus psilocybe or panaeolus for example and also on the species. Psilocybe azurescens are way strong than regular&nbsp; psilocybe cubensis. Panaeolus cyanescens and most members are a lot stronger than most psilocybe with the exception of a few like azurescens. A gram of either is between 3-4 grams of regular cubensis. The strain doesn&#039;t really make difference with cubes in the grand scheme. LSD varies in quality too much and the 2C family makes people nauseous which isn&#039;t fun if you&#039;re not used to it. Mushrooms will sometimes make people nauseous too. 4-aco-dmt is the acetoxy of psilocin or 4-ho-dmt which psilocybin metabolizes into before you start to trip. I would take between 15 and 20mg. It&#039;s a lot gentler because the come up is smoother and it may cross the bbb while psilocybin doesn&#039;t. In general a smoother experience, but you can push it or even convert it into 4-ho-dmt. It&#039;ll ease you into a rich and visual world as well as provide the head space of a psychedelic without being overbearing. I would leave the 25x-nbome alone for now, because they lack the depth of more traditional psychedelics.

				Arcadia gives advice that assumes you know how many milligrams of a 4 subbed triptamine would be a good dose and that you have a scale capable of measuring those precise weights.&nbsp; No matter what you take start very small to make sure you aren&#039;t allergic to the substance... wait a day or more before you decide you aren&#039;t allergic!&nbsp; When I say very small I mean 1mg or a nibble of a shroom..

				1) Which psycedelic do you recommend for first time user? Why or why not?<br />- Shrooms or 4-Aco-DMT. It&#039;s a nice simple not too long trip, with introspection and wonderful visuals<br /><br />2) What dosage do you recommend for first time user?<br />- Just under the average dose, so with 4-Aco-DMT go for 20mg or shrooms 2.5-3g<br /><br />3) What time of safety precautions do I need to take? i.e., babysitter, lock myself in a room, etc.?<br />- Honestly nothing really, you could have a sitter with you but I never did, just feel free to explore the trip<br /><br />4) Any advice on how to create an ideal setting for my first experience? I don&#039;t want it to be anxious or scary...so what can be done to avoid that?<br />- Trips aren&#039;t like the horror stories that are portrayed in the media, you won&#039;t freak out. Just find some music, maybe a film or two and do whatever you want. Maybe get a pen and paper to draw and write<br /><br />5) Any recommendations for other drugs to mix with it? For example: &quot;eat Xg of shrooms, wait 20min and smoke some bud&quot;<br />I never smoke weed on psys because the potential to get paranoia (which I sometimes do with weed) is too great. If you want to come down have some benzos on hand. At the present time I like to mix psys with stims or opiates just because I get bored but then again I have a lot of experience with them. If I were you I&#039;d just experience the drug as is.<br /><br />Have Fun!<br />

				Good advice has been said already, just to add...<br /><br />If you want a short trip for your first one, try salvia, but do it with a sitter because some people get a very bad trip from sally.<br /><br />If you want to do some more research about your psychedelics, look up the books PiHKAL and TiHKAL by Alexander Shulgin, they cover many psychedelics.

				chill music<br />if possible to have access to outdoors&nbsp; generally&nbsp; flora has positive effects on mood<br />have somebody with you that you have a comfortable and open relationship with<br /><br />synthaethesia, stimuli interpreted by&nbsp; one sense may blend into the other. i.e. being in a cold temperature may be extra sensitive, if it begins to make you feel uncomfortable then your visuals may become &quot;uncomfortable&quot; visuals.<br />the same also applies for tying together good experiences, you will become extra sensitive to your sorrounds and may gain a new appreciation for them,&nbsp; gain appreciation for life, and have great introspection. at a point like this your visuals and tactile sensations may become the most beautiful things you&#039;ve ever seen and the best feelings you&#039;ve ever felt<br /><br />controlling environment really&nbsp; by planning ahead really is essential<br />also, be happy that you are going to take a journey be excited about it before hand and look forward to it,&nbsp; this will make for best results.<br /><br />-best wishes&nbsp; :) <br /><br />btw i wouldn&#039;t recommend salvia,&nbsp; its not even a psychedelic.&nbsp; it is a short acting dissociative that is VERY powerful and quite often terrifying for most

				Agreeed Cabfare!&nbsp; Salvia is NOT a psychedelic and is the only drug with which I ever had an experience that was not in any way enjoyable.&nbsp; I had a better time when I killed myself (OD) taking Aminita and then being revived into a coma and waking up in the hospital after a horrible but spiritual experience.&nbsp; Yah.&nbsp; Death was better than salvia which is pretty fucked up to think about right now.&nbsp; Those are two of three drugs I recommend to stay away from the third one being heroin.&nbsp; A good friend of mine died from a heroin overdose (mixed with crack and booze too) right in the next room.

				hi ,<br />Tripping is very exciting. every trip is different.<br />the most important thing: try not to stress. <br />mushrooms are great but dosage varies between species (i pick the local ones when theyre in season, never tried from SR. so im not much help with that) <br />make things as comfortable as you can both in mindset and environment. <br />do your research erowid.org is great.. you never stop learning<br />have fun!!<br />

				depends on the species. psilocybe cubensis is a standard potency at 2-3, but psilocybe cyanescens, which I have, is twice as potent, so only 1 gram or even 1/2 a gram for beginners<br /><br />the psilocybe genus of mushrooms is the oldest psychedelic on the planet dating back 6000 years, long before anything was made in a lab. It never actually went away. It&#039;s been there the whole time<br /><br />It is actually part of UNESCO World Heritage site now<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tassili_n%27Ajjer

Shrooms can be a good beginning for psychedelics, no doubt about it. <br />2) dosage is dependent on what shrooms you&#039;re gone use and from whom they&#039;re coming - best would be to buy from a friend that uses them often himself (he&#039;ll know best) or from a trustable seller on SR - don&#039;t by from &quot;creeps&quot;. Ask advice to your seller.<br />3) Take the precautions that make you feel safe. An intense trip can bring you out of your &quot;comfort zone&quot;, so it&#039;s nice to have a setting where you feel confident. That might help if the experience get&#039;s intense for you. Don&#039;t overdo it - mushrooms will not kill you and the long term damage isn&#039;t that bad. Just be aware that the key to a good trip is: &quot;feeling good&quot;. <br />4) this answer could be very long, or very short. For the long version: read a lot of books. For the short version: see my answer number 3. Relaxing music is always welcome (psychedelic music for the intense fase of the trip, chill-out/relaxing/meditation music can also be a good help). Have some vitamine C (fruit juice), maybe some weed (if you&#039;re a regular smoker that&#039;ll help you to relax - otherwise you might want to avoid it). Alcohol is a &quot;NO GO&quot;. A relaxed place with some nice friends that are sharing the experience and maybe one experienced user that stays sober to &quot;guide&quot; you (&quot;guiding&quot; is something special - not everyone is good at it, but in fac: it&#039;s incredibly easy to do as long as the person has enough experience and can enjoy being with people who are experiencing &quot;it&quot;). <br />5) look to my answer number 4. <br /><br /><br />If you have more questions feel free to PM me. <br />If not, don&#039;t make to much of a fuss about it. Just eat those shrooms and enjoy. <br /><br />A few tips to end with: <br />- always remember you toke a psychedelic substance that influences you and your perception of &quot;what&#039;s happening&quot;<br />- always remember that you CHOOSE to take the substance (never take it if you don&#039;t want to) <br />- don&#039;t forget that there is no damage done to your body/mind after 1 normal portion of psychedelics (some people have used 1000 portions of different psychedelics in a few months/years and are still running multi-national companies or complicated scientific research)<br />- enjoy your experience and try to learn from it - if it&#039;s not enjoyable any more don&#039;t forget that you choose to do it... then laugh at the situation and relax... it&#039;ll soon get better - if not: relax more, relax more, lett go, lett go, lett go, lett go, lett go, lett go, lett... and laugh!<br />- last but not least: a good psychedelic experience is often dependent on a &quot;healthy lifestyle&quot;: good sleep, good food, healthy physical acitvity<br /><br />ENJOY <br />RELAX<br /><br />RELAX &amp; ENJOY

				Wow! Thanks for all of the great advice here.<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely going to steer clear of Salvia. I&#039;ve heard way too many horror stories. - I&#039;ll have to wait a bit before I can give them a try, but I think I&#039;ll likely go with what most have advised and try 2-2.5g of shrooms. Looks like I won&#039;t have the option of a sitter, so I&#039;ll just make sure I&#039;m in a safe and secure environment. I&#039;ve got some Rx benzos and bud (naturally!) on hand to assist the process.<br /><br />thanks again, SR.

So to answer your question yes, dmt is the be all end all. It did significantly raise my heartrate immediately after smoking though. I did not expect this and kind of freaked out for a second or two before having to tell myself to calm down and take big deep breathes. After about a minute(i think) my heartrate dropped back to a reasonable pace and I was free to relax, close my eyes, and go on unimaginable journey. My only advice would be to have someone with you. At least in the next room or something incase you have any heart related issues. Or just to calm you down if you&#039;re freaking out. My only mistake in taking it was doing it alone. And also I wouldn&#039;t suggest just taking it recreationally, if you want to have fun take shrooms or acid. If you want to learn about the true nature of reality smoke dmt.

				I only recently experimented with Lsd myself.<br /><br />I took a 60ug blotter, just as a taste. Defintite perception change, but no visuals.<br /><br />2nd attempt, 180ug blotter. Much better this time, alight open-eye visuals, fluttering lights in my peripheral vision, surfaces apperared to be breathing. And patterned surfaces were everso slightly wiggly.<br /><br />3rd attempt I fucked right up.<br />300ug. BUT I had been a day-long mdma binge, 2g in about a day. <br />The acid had no noticible affect. <br /><br />That&#039;s my experiences so far. I will try again, but I&#039;ll stay off anything else for a day or two before-hand. Many people recommend taking some mdma AFTER the acid kicks-in, to enhance the experience.<br /><br /><br />As far as safety goes, setting and surroundings are key. As-is your mind set at the time.<br />For small doses, you won&#039;t need a sitter. But for higher doses with intense visuals, a sitter is recommended by almost everyone who uses Lsd.<br /><br />Personally, I tidied up a bit, set up some mood lighting, pit some music on and just made myself as comfortable as possible. Layed down on the sofa.<br />Don&#039;t take acid for the first time and go for a walk lol. See how it affects you first, and whether you actually like it or not.<br /><br />There&#039;s no real &#039;abort&#039; button for Lsd. But having some benzos to hand, will help take the edge off if you start freaking out. It won&#039;t stop the experience but 30mg of diazepam will make you not give a toss.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s my advice.<br />There&#039;s a dosage chart over on erowid.org I believe.

				I recommend some of Cyclone&#039;s Albine PE&#039;s.<br />For a first time user, 2 grams is plenty.<br />Three grams had me uncomfortable, and I hadn&#039;t really tripped in while.<br />I would not take these alone.<br /><br />Pretty much just follow the advice already given to you.<br />Every trip is unique in its own way.<br />Just be safe, smart, and have fun.

				To clarify what I said earlier about Salvia... the only reason I recommended it is because the trip is short. Far more important than what substance you take is to take an appropriate dosage, and to have a sitter that you trust.<br />

				I&#039;ve only done LSD and shrooms, and on both of those I took walks through nature. Shit&#039;s intense, I have to recommend them. Whatever you take, prepare to have your mind blown.
