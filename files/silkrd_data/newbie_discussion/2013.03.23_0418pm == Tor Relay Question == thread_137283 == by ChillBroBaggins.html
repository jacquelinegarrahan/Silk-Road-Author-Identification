				Title: <strong>Tor Relay Question</strong><br />

				Hey folks,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been browsing the SR awhile now, and I feel comfortable enough to start making purchases. One loose end I feel I haven&#039;t covered yet is how Tor&#039;s anonymity will be preserved when I&#039;m back at school. I am required to log in to the network using a username and password that links back to me. If I was to run Tor, does anybody know how much information the college has access to?<br /><br />For example: My rudimentary understanding of Tor says that because the college&#039;s internet is first in line in the Tor relay system, wouldn&#039;t they be able to get full access to whatever I was looking at? The closest analogy I can think of is just using my home&#039;s internet, where because I&#039;m requesting the data with my network, that information is fully available to me after being relayed through Tor.<br /><br />Any light some guru could shed on this would be reassuring, but I get the impression I&#039;m gonna have to post this in a different board once I get those 50 posts...

Incoming is also encrypted for you and is decrypted locally.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137283.msg930964#msg930964">Quote from: ChillBroBaggins on March 23, 2013, 04:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If I was to run Tor, does anybody know how much information the college has access to?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unless you use a bridge they can find out that you use tor but that&#039;s all. I have no idea if there&#039;s a problem with that tbh.

				Great, thanks for the reply! That cleared it up. I doubt using Tor on their server will be an issue, although it is going to make me take a look at those finer details to make sure everything&#039;s secure.
