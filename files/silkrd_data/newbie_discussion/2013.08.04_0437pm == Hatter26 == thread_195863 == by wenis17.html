				It seems there have been a few top vendors that have just up and disappeared lately. No goodbyes or any indication that they were leaving; they are just gone. Hope this doesn&#039;t indicate any problems or busts.<br /><br />Hatter26 was definitely a quality vendor. Great products and speedy shipping. Also, out of my 50 transactions on SR he definitely had the best stealth I&#039;ve ever seen. He will be missed.

				Definitely sad news...hope the dude&#039;s okay.&nbsp; His absence leaves a major void in the opiate department--been looking for some Opana IR, but haven&#039;t seen any around since he&#039;s been gone.&nbsp; Also, he was just as helpful as could be when it came to chemistry and harm-reduction info.&nbsp; Wish I&#039;d ordered from him more when I&#039;d had the chance...

				Hi,<br /><br />As much as it may not help to bring more attention, it is already too late in a way as we all know information posted on the &quot;internets&quot; is like pissing in a pool.&nbsp; You can never get it all out..<br /><br />So, with that said, as a contact of h26 there is some information but it is not good.<br /><br />There have been &quot;legal&quot; issues making it unsafe to be linked to SR.&nbsp; This was something that happened outside of the darknet and all that can really be said is that it was what happened IRL.<br /><br />With that in mind, all I know is that no one else was &quot;compromised&quot; as the issue did not originate from within SR at all.&nbsp; It was not a &quot;stupid error&quot; or other LE that caused this just FYI.<br /><br />Hopefully things work out and there is more information for everyone later but not at this point.&nbsp; <br /><br />The issue has cost a huge lost of funds and legal fees, so if people want to donate that would be nice.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure that posting a bitcoin address for direct sending would be the safest route so an account has been made on SR with the name of &quot;liber88&quot; and if anyone feels that they can pitch in anything can help.&nbsp; Just send it directly from account to account and it will be assured that it is passed on to hopefully help &quot;fix&quot; this whole mess.<br /><br />Also, as the complements are nice, the key would be to draw as little attention to this situation as possible.&nbsp; I may make a new post that &quot;limits&quot; the key words in searching the username and hopefully people can find the post from word of mouth just so there is that much less info that LE would try to use.<br /><br />If the senior users want to send me a PM, I should be able to confirm that this is real and not just a scam.&nbsp; Of course I won&#039;t be able to make any exact reference but should be able to confirm that this is legit from other obscure things that only would only be known by both parties.<br /><br />Thanks all<br /><br /><br />PS.

				Bro <br /><br />we are gonna need some type of credibility on your part. You have Made 1 post, which that really doesnt matter.&nbsp; I had stopped using SR for almost a Month i came back and checkd for Hatter and he was Gone.. Now i know why.. Now im not saying anything bad about you at all but how do we not know were not just funding your account? You have a newbie account also.. Again im not acusing but anyone in their right mind would ask How is it you are priviledged to the info? <br /><br />Not to mention Hatter needs legal defense money? He was a TOP seller on here. I feel he was plenty smart enough and i thinkhe even said he kept a lawer on stand by..&nbsp; One more question what made u send me this Msg? Or is it a BULK msg or because im a OLD school member&gt;? I just have ti ask this stuff bro..

				Hi,<br /><br />Just fyi, h26 asked that a pm to this post was sent to some forum members that specifically posted a question to the abrupt &quot;exit&quot;.&nbsp; So just to be clear there was not a tonne of people was spammed or bulked PM&#039;d, this information was something that h26 wanted to clarify so that the community (which I understand that h26 put a lot of time and effort into helping others) would have an idea of what happened.<br /><br />I understand this account is new but I am not new to the things that was going on here on SR, I&#039;ve been a lurker and as I had made some investments when btc was in the $5-10 range.&nbsp; We all know that even a 1000 bitcoins at $10 would be just 10k, at $5 it would be even less.&nbsp; So in regards to btc as an investment it was not too hard to enter the market at that time and not much money (relatively) was necessary.&nbsp; So there was not much &quot;risk&quot; only because the prices were so low and at that time BTC was still a novelty to all but the &quot;geeks&quot; and SR and the gambling sites.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even think that most trading sites even had any KYC and AML policies.<br /><br />Hell when Shotishi Dice came out BTC prices still only hovered at $10 each but it was shortly after that when things shot through the roof!&nbsp; Interesting fact (if I remember correctly), the kid (IIR that was not even 21 at that time) that created Shotishi Dice sold the code for just a few grand after only running it for only a few weeks, maybe even cheaper (as he did not feel comfortable in dealing with the legal aspects of gambling laws as it already generated so much btc in such a short time) but I don&#039;t remember the details although in less than a year of it coming online it sold again for $11+ Million in Btc!&nbsp; Wish that was me!<br /><br />Anyway sorry about being off topic, regarding h26 there may have only been a couple people IRL that even knew about what was going on here, very much care was taken to make sure things were secure for everyone in darknet and IRL as plausible deny-ability kept the people that knew h26 safer from being put in a bad situation of being targeted and &quot;questioned&quot; by LE.<br /><br />So, even though I&#039;ve known h26 for a long time and spent time in discussing the trading of bitcoins, playing the market and other &quot;buddy&quot; stuff, etc, I was never even aware of the existence of the h26 alter-ego or what went on.&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;ve known SR existed from the gawker article like most people did at that time and realized that with the large amount of bitcoin traffic that went through this site it would be simple due diligence to &quot;know&quot; and keep an eye about what would be going on and how it directly affects the btc value on a daily basis.&nbsp; Same goes with the gambling sites, mining, scams and all that fun stuff because since BTC is not &quot;owned&quot; by any country or central authority there is no way to, say, look at the GDP to find out if it is time to sell or buy.&nbsp; Only to look at the entire &quot;clearnet/darknet&quot; vendor markets, demand, mining and so on and so fourth, I&#039;m sure anyone dealing with BTC already know this.<br /><br />Until h26 had informed me of what happened and how it went down there was no reason for me to have an account since I could see all the forums anyway and there is plenty of information to read without needing to associate myself with an account but h26 trusted me and that I could let the community know at least something and to be very careful on any information that could be used against h26.<br /><br />As my previous post said senior or trusted users can contact me with some arbitrary information that only h26 may know so that this can be verified as NOT A SCAM.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even when h26 asked me to do this I wanted to be sure that what was told to me was true so I did search and did quite a bit of reading posts about h26.&nbsp; As knowing h26 IRL I know that h26 is a good character and makes the best effort to do the right things for everyone and so on.&nbsp; The thing is that h26 is very private about life and does not say much even to the few people that are close.&nbsp; <br /><br />So after many hours of reading, even I was surprised to see as many good things that people in the other posts have said and about how much h26 contributed to the community.&nbsp; It was common to see how people have said many times that h26 always tried to give more if possible and was always very careful to take the extra steps to get everyone what they needed in the safest &quot;delivery&quot; and fastest methods which I noticed was pretty consistently referred to as one of the best methods used whenever a review or reference was made.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course since nothing can be seen on SR itself there is no way for me to know what was said there but I can guess what it may have been and understand why h26 requested that the account was deleted for everyone&#039;s sake, even if that meant that quite a few people got a &quot;free&quot; parting gift, as h26 told me &quot;they can&#039;t ever say that the loyal customers never got any perks! ;)&quot;.<br /><br />Okay, in all seriousness this event is still very serious and being handled in the best possible way, whatever that may mean... Although as h26 told me these things and about some things that others whom felt was really helped because h26 gave them safety advice and promoted harm reduction along with what was necessary to stay safe I saw a glimmer in the eyes, just recalling a few things that was said to h26 in the feedback and how happy it was to know that at least someone was helped, instead of just being in it to &quot;support an addiction&quot; or just to make money.<br /><br />Last, it was my idea to have an account on SR (safer when it is directly sent account to account because of the built in mixer) that voluntary donations could be made, all of which will go to hopefully help to make things better.<br /><br />And of course anyone who wants to verify this please send a PM.&nbsp; In fact until everyone is satisfied that this is not a scam I will even return any donations that someone may send, just to show that this is completely true.<br /><br />Thanks

</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also in regards to the things that you said with your experience with h26, I&#039;ve asked about it and with such little detail there was not much that could even be recalled in those situations nor that even though you are asking so many questions regarding that this is not a scam as well as saying that you had h26 was giving you an issue over $5 while not offering anything in your PMs to verify that you even had any interaction with h26.<br /><br />The couple things that h26 said was that it may very well have been an issue with the selection of &quot;combined items&quot; which was something that many people tried to use to &quot;bypass&quot; the cost of shipping, etc.&nbsp; Many people tried to take advantage of that so h26 said it was clearly posted that items would be canceled if it was incorrectly used. <br /><br />Also, it seems that you have been the ONLY person that has posted about how h26 responded to you about the $5 and I would think others would also post things like this in the reviews for h26 as well.&nbsp; So far I have not seen anything like that and what I have seen is just about opposite to how you say h26 treats people.&nbsp; If you can share some posts with h26 doing this to others then I will gladly say don&#039;t bother to help h26.<br /><br />Shouldn&#039;t this go both ways?&nbsp; At this point the only posts are focused on this being a scam and NO ONE has even offered to PM to verify things.&nbsp; If people had PM&#039;d me and I was not able to prove that the h26 situation was true then sure call this a scam.<br /><br />Last, when h26 did tell me about SR h26 and how it progressed from something very simple to what eventually was provided when h26 left.&nbsp; It was not just same stuff that anyone else offered the same things as all the others have, from what I&#039;ve been told and understand is that what was offered took a lot of time and effort as well as extra equipment (with low yields) and h26 was very anal about keeping everything &quot;sterile&quot;.&nbsp; It was because h26 was able to completely remove the binders that allowed people to safely use it and NOT get the rare &quot;blood disease&quot; which resulted in the methods that others used and still had binders in the end result.&nbsp; The same care went into everything else so that people who did not/ could not safely filter and preserve the h that they used had an option to have something safe(er) and exactly standardized and measured.&nbsp; As well as having sterile water and such that others did not have or care to offer.&nbsp; Doing this was not cheap and took a lot longer than just tossing some stuff into a baggie.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have seen how people would talk about when h26 would go into stealth just to ensure that everyone got what they needed and with the same quality.&nbsp; If it was all about the money then why would h26 care to do this?&nbsp; It did not seem like others did things like this.<br /><br />So far from what I&#039;ve been told and seen right here on the forums h26 took a lot of extra time with everyone and put a lot of extra effort and expense to offer something that others would charge the same for and still no one offered what h26 did.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve only come here and was willing to post this because I respected what h26 did on here and as a buddy IRL.&nbsp; <br /><br />H26 had always said that SR was a &quot;one of a kind&quot; community where people did not judge and treated each other with respect and treated people with courtesy especially in a situation like this.&nbsp; So far all I&#039;ve gotten from posting (as a favor for h26) is repeated hassling about trying to scam people.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had enough at this point, the way I see it is that people should just come out and just post all their gripes with how &quot;bad&quot; h26 was and all the posts where he would not help others out, etc...<br /><br />That way it will be clear that h26 does not deserve anything and this will be my last post.<br /><br />Otherwise as I&#039;ve said repeatedly, h26 is willing to verify the situation so since it seems so &quot;suspicious&quot; PM ME and settle this for good.<br /><br />Peace. <br /><br />Oh forgot to add, from what I understand about SR from the forums and h26 is that having a top rating and ranking at a 1% is a huge gap from ~8-9% maybe I&#039;m wrong and h26 has a tonne of gold bars buried in the back yard.&nbsp; Others feel free to chime in on this too.

LMAO No we dont sell drugs for the money, just for fun... <br /><br />aLSO says he did it for people in pain... I ask hatter one time after 4 orders i think when i was about 5 bucks short would he let me pay him back.. NOPE SURE WOULD..even though my buyer stats and the amount of money iv spent is out of this world..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Also, it seems that you have been the ONLY person that has posted about how h26 responded to you about the $5 and I would think others would also post things like this in the reviews for h26 as well.&nbsp; So far I have not seen anything like that and what I have seen is just about opposite to how you say h26 treats people.&nbsp; If you can share some posts with h26 doing this to others then I will gladly say don&#039;t bother to help h26.<br /><br />Shouldn&#039;t this go both ways?&nbsp; At this point the only posts are focused on this being a scam and NO ONE has even offered to PM to verify things.&nbsp; If people had PM&#039;d me and I was not able to prove that the h26 situation was true then sure call this a scam.<br /><br />I have seen how people would talk about when h26 would go into stealth just to ensure that everyone got what they needed and with the same quality.&nbsp; If it was all about the money then why would h26 care to do this?&nbsp; It did not seem like others did things like this.<br /><br />So far from what I&#039;ve been told and seen right here on the forums h26 took a lot of extra time with everyone and put a lot of extra effort and expense to offer something that others would charge the same for and still no one offered what h26 did.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve only come here and was willing to post this because I respected what h26 did on here and as a buddy IRL.&nbsp; <br /><br />H26 had always said that SR was a &quot;one of a kind&quot; community where people did not judge and treated each other with respect and treated people with courtesy especially in a situation like this.&nbsp; So far all I&#039;ve gotten from posting (as a favor for h26) is repeated hassling about trying to scam people.<br /><br />Otherwise as I&#039;ve said repeatedly, h26 is willing to verify the situation so since it seems so &quot;suspicious&quot; PM ME and settle this for good.<br /><br />Peace. <br /><br />Oh forgot to add, from what I understand about SR from the forums and h26 is that having a top rating and ranking at a 1% is a huge gap from ~8-9% maybe I&#039;m wrong and h26 has a tonne of gold bars buried in the back yard.&nbsp; Others feel free to chime in on this too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />FYI- Quotes edited for specific content and to remove the non-critical items.<br /><br />First of all--<br />L88-If you&#039;re legit, I for one sincerely appreciate the PM and the fact that you were willing to come on here to provide some details and closure for those of us that were concerned about Hatter&#039;s disappearance.&nbsp; <br />As for the comments about SR being a &quot;community where people did not judge and treated each other with respect and treated people with courtesy&quot;, I personally believe for the most part, this is true.&nbsp; With caveats.<br />As in any community, there are always those that seem to act like douche bags regardless of the situation, and there are always those that will try to profit at the expense of others.<br /><br />I dont know AA, or his prior interactions with Hatter---BUT I do know from my personal experience that Hatter was VERY cautious, and worked very hard to protect himself from those that would use his generosity against himself.&nbsp; If there was a specific instance where a &quot;loan&quot; was requested and denied, I suspect Hatter did not have sufficient trust in the buyer, and felt the risk was more than he was willing to accept. His money, his products, his rules.&nbsp; <br /><br />At one time, not long after joining the site, i also found myself short a few dollars for shipping and asked for a &quot;loan&quot;--which was also rejected. At the time, given the circumstances, my short tenure on the site, the limited amount of interaction that I&#039;d had with Hatter up to that point etc. etc.---rejecting my loan request seemed like the appropriate thing to do for someone that was concerned about being taken advantage of.<br />&nbsp;In hindsight, I would have done the same thing, and I think i told Hatter so. No harm done. <br />When i go to WalMart, I have no right to expect them &quot;loan&quot; me money as I&#039;m standing in the check out line--I either have have to put something back and get it later, or come up with some more cash. <br /><br />Fast forward several months, many more orders, much more money spent,&nbsp; and many PM&#039;s back and forth about various things--and Hatter was much more receptive to offering his assistance in moments of need. To the tune of several hundred dollars at one point. <br />But sharing his knowledge, providing help specific to usage or dosage, etc etc---this is what was truly valuable. <br />The amount of time he spent preparing his products, maintaining laboratory-type cleanliness and detail in his preparation etc is where his generosity really came to light. <br />No other vendor prior to, or since, has even gotten close. Why would they?? It cost too damn much to be that careful! <br /><br />I am not going to accuse you of running a scam--I dont think any of us have nearly enough info to make a statement of that magnitude.<br />&nbsp;But you also have to understand that EVERYONE here has to be cautious to the highest levels--of everyone and everything.<br />Someone with a brand new account offering to take &quot;donations&quot; for a vendor that has been gone a couple of months is out of the ordinary and is definitely suspicious. <br />Look--by your own admission, you have spent months lurking, and reading the forums to find out about bitcoins.<br />&nbsp;It would not be terribly difficult for someone that had the motivation to spend a couple of months reading all the &quot;Hatter&quot; posts etc. and learn quite a lot about the guy, his habits, and what folks thought about him--I&#039;m not accusing, just pointing out the obvious.<br /><br />Lets say, hypothetically, that you are not who you say you are, but in fact you are actually a LEO building a case against someone we know as Hatter--by playing on long-time customer&#039;s feelings of loyalty and concern, we all begin to reminisce about what a great vendor this person might have been. <br />In doing so, we freely offer information that could be possibly interpreted as details of potentially illegal activity. All hypothetical,&nbsp; of course.<br />By thinking we&#039;re helping, we end up hurting. <br /><br />It is odd the way you spelled &quot;ton&quot; though...definitely not American.
