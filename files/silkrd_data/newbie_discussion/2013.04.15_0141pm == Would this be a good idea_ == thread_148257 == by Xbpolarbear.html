				So I just ordered a few items off the SR, and I am pretty sketched out because of my location. I was thinking of this, but then I decided not to because I thought they may re-route the package, or just throw it away. I&#039;ve been getting mail from a person that previously used that mail box, a bunch of mail. I was wondering if I can use the name on those letters on the packages that are being sent that way if I do get caught, I can just say I don&#039;t know anything about it and that I never open the letters I just put them back in the mail box. They would then call them (maybe) and they would explain they have nothing at all to do with it, and we would both end up getting off without any kind of punishment because first of all, she doesn&#039;t live there anymore,&nbsp; and second of all, I would have a solid story to back up that the package wasn&#039;t mine. This way I would be able to order as many packages as I needed without any worry. What are the chances it will get re-routed/thrown away? Would this be a good idea?

				if you get mail for him frequently enough, maybe, but I&#039;d personally stick to using your own name and occasionally ordering legal things in your name so the SR packages blend in well. It might look weird if the previous person just gets spam mail and out of nowhere gets a priority box/envelope.

				there&#039;s also the possibility (however remote) that the previous resident decides to put a forward order at the PO to his new address, and he will get your drugs, which would either lead to him calling LE or having an incredible night.
