If DPR turns out to be a fed or informant or he gets caught somehow and the FBI starts recording addresses and you DO use PGP then all they&#039;ll get is unintelligable garble but if you sent it in clear-text then you&#039;re basically fucked.<br /><br />I doubt SR is a honeypot but not using PGP is just idiocy that can not be afforded in a business like this.

				Yes, you should always PGP your address to the vendor. In the event that SR is compromised, It is best that only you and the vendor can read your communications. <br /><br />If you PGP the only way anyone could read your address is to get your vendors private key.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry too much, if SR is compromised, it&#039;s very unlikely that the police would even bother investigating small quantities and if you don&#039;t have them anymore i.e. you&#039;ve already had a good time, then you&#039;re sweet as punch. <br /><br />Yes, PGP in the future its not that hard and there are a ton of tutorials on it<br />No, don&#039;t worry that you didn&#039;t use PGP too much<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />Annex

For email many used to use TOR Mail but that&#039;s compromised now so&nbsp; you can just put any fake one. DO NOT use your real email obviously, anyone with your public key(the key you share with others) can see this information plainly.<br /><br />Also make your key size as large as possible(4096bits) the larger it is the more &quot;futureproof&quot; it is NEVER have it be below 2048bit.<br /><br />Make sure not to use the same PGP key on the darknet and on the clearnet. This can obviously be used to identify you. I even use different keys for different websites. i.e. one for silkroad, one for silkroad forums, one for other marketplaces ect.<br /><br />The less linkages the better.

				Thank you very much for helping me!<br /><br />Ok, i tried to endrypt and decrypt messages successful. <br /><br />But when i encrypt for example my adress, i encrypt it for the key from the vendor and for my key. Do the vendor not need my pgp key and the password for my key?
