				What are the pros/cons of shipping to a) current resident or b) previous resident? I&#039;m in the US.<br /><br />Seems like using a previous resident&#039;s name will risk mail forwarding, but provide a little more distance in case LE gets involved. However, anyone can mail anyone else a package, so proving that you expected/wanted a package is required in either case. Which is why there&#039;s need for a controlled delivery and such things.<br /><br />What do other people do?

				I always use my real name. You&#039;re just getting some mail, like usual. An ex-resident suddenly getting mail is suspicious - plus they can set up mail forwarding for packages, so your package might suddenly be gone.

				Man, go for it. Any name is game and a dead mans name is the safest. He won&#039;t talk either&nbsp; 8)

				i get shit for the last person that lived in my place all the time but no packages. i think this would be easier for someone in an apartment where the resident changes a lot..

				I use my real name.&nbsp; I just do not sign for anything.&nbsp; I don&#039;t order anything (from Ebay, Amazon, etc) during the time I order my goodies from SR.&nbsp; I do not open the door when the USPS guy/gal rings the door, I just let them leave the package in front of my door.&nbsp; And I never sign for anything.&nbsp; Better to risk a shipment than get shipped to jail...would be a total buzz kill

				Im from the UK. Im yet to buy anythin, half way there. I dont think i&#039;ll be using my real name though, just so it doesnt associate it me with anything. Especially if it something that will fit through the letter box. On the unfortunate chance the parcel was found, police involved. If they came to your door, its not addressed to you so its easy to get them off your case. Unfortunately you lose your goodies, but at least your not at the cop shop, lol <br /><br />meatman
