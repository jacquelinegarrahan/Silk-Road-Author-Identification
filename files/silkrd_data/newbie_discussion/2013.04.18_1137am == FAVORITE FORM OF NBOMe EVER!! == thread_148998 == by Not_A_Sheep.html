				So basically a couple weeks ago&nbsp; I mixed like 70 mg&#039;s of 25C-NBOMe and 630 mg&#039;s of HPBCD and added a drop or two of grain alcohol, i dont remember exactly but just a teeny tiny bit. After I made sure the clump was evenly mixed throughout I plopped it in the middle of a paper plate. I then put the plate into the microwave for like 7 seconds, it puffed up all crazy into a big ball lol. When I took it out the globby mess I noticed it had transformed into a &quot;crunchy&quot; crystally ball that hady real actuall shiny little crystally bits like glitter all indside (I think this is probably the hpbcd?? as its sugar based??). So I chopped it up nice and fine with my trusty razooo blade and then scraped it into a large capsule. A few nights after making the concoction I decided to test it out! I started by just inhaling the littlest bit i could seperate from the pile. I did that like 3 or 4 times within an hour before I started to feel a strong amphetamine-esque body high. Long story short I ended up doin 10 to 15 bumps of the nbome by end of the night and was tripping so hard (btw k-holing while facing on nbome is very very awesome)., this is an awesome way to prepare as you can easily blow 20 mgs of the mix and have a real nice time. I think the microwave kills the potency a little bit, but seeing as how godddam freaking cheap nbome is I kinda prefered it to the disgusting taste i get from laying my blotters, and the metal numb tonqe is the worst lols. Anyways it didnt burn me nose at all and I had awesome time with completely zero negative side effects ( which most 2c&#039;s except 2c-p makes me very very sick like). <br />P.S. I kinda always wondered if i coulda jut put the ball uncrushed into a baggie and it not fall apart lol&nbsp; ;D

				You Just mix as much as you want to work with (50 mgs is prob a good start) 1:9, NBOMe:HPBCD<br />Shake that mix up real good in a little glass vial or something untill its thouroughly mixed up<br />Then, starting adding 1 drop at a time(depending on amount of powder used) of grain alcohol, vodka, everclear or anything like that<br />Stop adding per drop when youve just barely have all the powder wet, and you can mush around into a goopy sort of mass<br />At this point I just used an unbent paperclip to mush it around until it was evenly mixed together, then I plopped it into the middle of a paper plate and put in the microwave and watched until it puffed up into a dry crunchy crystal ball lol<br /><br />Chop up wit a razor blade and try blowing at about 4 or 5 mg&#039;s to start this will be mild dose, I probably would just get a slightly &quot;shiny&quot; adderal like feel from this amount

				This is interesting. The taste of nbome is awful. I read a trip report where someone said that food tasted really good on it, but I don&#039;t know how that&#039;s possible because it tastes like absolute shit and makes everything taste metallic and bitter.

				this sounds a little dangerous since nbome&#039;s are only known to be dosed around 1mg, and having a few more mg, you&#039;re gonna have a bad time!<br />oh well, i&#039;d try it

				well technically 1mg pure nbome would equal to 10 mgs of this mix because your using a 1:9 complexing ratio so it absorbs into your nasal cavity very nicely and also when I did this there was no bad taste or anything it went up smooth, also because you just blow a little point, I myself also HATE the taste and metallic numbness that is left in my mouth for hours after absorbing an NBOMe blotter through my mouth. Also the microwave might destroy a little of the strength, like i said i was blowin mad bumps of it all night but with K too, all in all it was awesome, if i ever want to trip on NBOMe again I would probably use this method though as opposed to liquid nasall spray, or blotters, its just super simple for me, with no negatives at all, for me at least.<br /><br />P.S. Its actually really crazy how big the NBOMe\HPBCD goop puffs up into a ball of crystalls, it looks wild lol
