				Yes. I tried posting over and over again and that&#039;s the only reason this posted. When I googled it I found this, so I&#039;m not the only one seeing this<br /><br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1hqufb/sr_forums/

				This seems to be happening to any browsers with the string &quot;AppleWebKit&quot; in their user agent. You are probably using Google Chrome, or Epiphany on Liberte. You *should* be using the TorBrowser only for many reasons:<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/<br /><br />But if for some reason you don&#039;t mind compromising your anonymity, you could simply remove AppleWebKit from your user agent, and/or change it to the Tor Browser user agent.<br />

				That&#039;s interesting. Are you absolutely sure you&#039;re using TBB and not a regular browser? Because you would be the first TBB user I&#039;ve heard of experiencing this issue, and none of the other thousands of TBB users accessing this forum are experiencing that issue.<br /><br />The string in the user agent that triggers the redirect is &quot;AppleWebKit&quot;. If you simply split it into &quot;Apple WebKit&quot;, you will not get redirected.<br /><br />You should not be getting redirected if you are using TBB.<br /><br />However, just in case, how are you accessing the forum? Through a Google search, bookmark, link on some other site, entering the address in the address bar?<br />

				Also, did you make any modifications to the default configuration of Tor Browser?<br /><br />Can you please extract TBB in a new location, run it from there and access the forum, and let me know if you are being redirected.<br /><br />

				I just downloaded the tor browser bundle on my friends MacBook and I am still experiencing this problem, even on his comp which has never had tor on it.&nbsp; I&#039;m only able to post this from my phone via onionbrowser. I&#039;m not sure how to get to that applewebkit thing your talking about
