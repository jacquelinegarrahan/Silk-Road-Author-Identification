				Bitinstant and zipzap are logging all transactions,&nbsp; running identity checks on the name you give,&nbsp; and reserve the <br />right to generate and distribute&nbsp; statistical reports looking for &quot;signs of illegal activity&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have heard people with no<br />risk factors say they received &quot;ID Error&quot; on a first transaction&nbsp; of&nbsp; $250, and received email&nbsp; demanding photo of <br />drivers license.&nbsp; <br /><br />They used to be anonymous but not now.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t recommend using them.&nbsp; I would rather just wire money to coin<br />buyer and call it an investment.&nbsp; Bitcoins really are the fastest growing investment available. <br /><br />

				Try bitfloor. No Id just an email to get an account &amp; TOR friendly. You do need access to a Bank of America branch to deposit cash though- no account needed. If that doesn&#039;t work for you there are some others that use Wells Fargo or Chase banks. I can&#039;t remember offhand which ones they are.

I&#039;m really upset over this since I was planning on going with them since Blue Sky and Bitfloor use Bank of America (none are near me except for an hour drive). Wells Fargo is the closest and most convenient bank near me :(

				I personally use Bitfloor. As stated, Tor friendly, just an email to get into your account, fast transactions. Only downside, it&#039;s Bank of America only, but I had no problem being a first time user there. I am not a member with them, but they still asked no questions, no ID, nothing. <br /><br />Bitfloor is my recommendation.

				After days of trying to understand and set up accounts with different companies. I finally decided last night i would give bluesky traders a try as my first experience.<br />I sent them an email last night. Got a reply this morning with directions of how to deposit the money. Received a confirmation email from them 12 minutes after making the deposit that my coins were on the way. And received them in my wallet 1 hour and 14 minutes later. A great service as far as i am concerned.<br /><br />The only downsides would be not open for business 24hrs a day and having to deposit in a bank. But i feel the ease of use and anonymity are pluses that matter more to me.<br /><br />Great service,<br />I will stick with them in the future

				If you have easy access to Bank of America, bitfloor is the shit!&nbsp; Hands down.&nbsp; No IDs, simple and fast.&nbsp; Did my first transaction today.&nbsp; Hope big brother doesn&#039;t bully them into using paper trail type transactions.

				Bitfloor seems a very good option.&nbsp; They seem to value customer privacy.&nbsp; I advise people to actually read User Terms on any vendor you use.&nbsp; <br />On Bitinstant/ZipZap and several others, by using system you agree to having privacy violated. <br />Another funding option is to use&nbsp; bank transfers for investment purposes, which is totally legal.&nbsp; I would not suggest a series of $100 transfers,&nbsp; but a single $500 -$1000 transfer every six months looks totally normal.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; after hearing me talk of Bitcoins, the bank adviser asked me how he could purchase Bitcoins since he felt it had great investment potential.<br /><br />Likewise,&nbsp; gambling sites that accept/pay in Bitcoins are now common&nbsp; and provide a&nbsp; plausible explanation for &quot;missing Bitcoins&quot;.<br /><br />I suspect the&nbsp; US government is pressuring vendors to track all Bitcoin purchases as of March 1.&nbsp; This would explain all the sites that have gone down recently.<br />&nbsp;

				I have had thousands of dollars in bit coins and have never bought one via one these big exchanges instead I started out buying them from people knew with greendot. I also was already selling rcs on clearnet. I knew it was risky but it was all about getting enough coins to get a vendor account here. I would&nbsp; offer price breaks to anyone who could pay in coins.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like the idea of having to provide personal information to those services.&nbsp; So with a little hard work you can get coins without ever having to deal with these large services.
