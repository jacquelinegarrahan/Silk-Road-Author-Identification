				I ordered agent orange from caerus that was supposed to come with some cookies for having screwed up my order previously and having to wait a week for him to send it. Said it was in transit on the 2nd but wasnt postmarked til the 5th. I assumed this unmarked package I received with no cookies was the blue cheese I ordered from Weed Indeed. After smoking what I thought was the cheese I left WI a bad review.<br /><br />Received a package today opened it up expecting the agent orange and cookies and found the bag labeled 1 oz blue cheese. Was blown away by the quality of this bud compared to the orange. WI was very generous, delivered three days after ordering. The bud smells, tastes and smokes great. Large dense buds with great bag appeal. You cannot get an ounce of this quality at this price anywhere else on the road. This guy is the real deal! Will definitely be ordering from him again.&nbsp; Sorry again WI for the bad comment. Is there any way to edit my review on SR?

				Weed Indeed<br /><br />Wow. Okay this was by far the best weed purchase I&#039;ve ever made. Ever. I cannot believe what Weed Indeed did for me, and it seems like everyone else that ordered.<br /><br />First of all, I ordered an ounce of the Blue Cheese. This ounce was a great price to begin with and he said it was high end. This was the nicest ounce I&#039;ve gotten in a good long time. The smell is so fresh and was obviously indoor plants. The frostyness of this bud was great and all of the nugs were FAT fingers! Not to mention this shit was overpacked!!<br /><br />Ok so just the ounce would earn any dealer a 5/5 for sure. Weed Indeed did not stop there. My ounce came with two different types of extra weed. Who does that? Lemon Kush and the power plant. The lemon kush is the nicest bud and tastes just like lemon when you take a hit. The lemon kush was definitely the best. The shipping was in a very timely fashion and extremely discrete. The weed did not get crushed at all in the process either. Thank you so much Weed Indeed, I highly recommend you to everyone that uses this site.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; Ok, first off, I wish I could post a review in the rumor mill review thread because the last review left there does not in anyway speak to my experiences with this excellent vender. I have executed something like 5-6 transactions with Weed Indeed, and every single one of them has not only exceeded my high ( har har ) expectations, but has gone well beyond even the best of my dealings with other weed venders here. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The shipping/stealth:&nbsp; This man is a pro. My packages are always sent out at the very first opportunity. I get my packages coast to coast ( USA ) in under 4 days, with my last order only taking 2! The packaging is A+ in every regard, and I guarantee you NO scent is leaking from this set up. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Product:&nbsp; Look, I&#039;ve been smoking weed for 20 years. Now, I&#039;m no super pot head or &quot;weed is my life&quot; guy, but I know what I like, and I know what&#039;s good. This shit is VERY good. I can&#039;t tell you how it compares to what others are selling for $400 an OZ, because why would I spend that much on an OZ when this shit right here is half that price. Every strain WI offers is beautiful and you can tell this cat gives a fuck. Perfectly trimmed, high quality smoke, at an unbelievable price. And as if that wasn&#039;t enough, this dude ALWAYS hooks me up big. It&#039;s obvious he appreciates his customers as much as I appreciate him. Throwing in extra samples etc is not a mandatory deed for venders, and it seems like most buyers have come to expect that or think its a right they have. But so far every order of mine through Weed Indeed has been over. Shut up and appreciate it.&nbsp; ;D<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication: My messages are always answered promptly and thoroughly, even though I imagine this dude is one busy MOFO. <br /><br />Overall, I can tell you all that this dude is straight up legit as can be. An absolute pleasure to work with. My search for a trusted, reliable, solid connection for dank ass buds is over . Thank you Weed Indeed for being an honest, GENEROUS dude. I leave you with a copy and paste snippet&nbsp; from an email I sent last night, after receiving a package I wasn&#039;t expecting for 2 more days ( sent Thursday, arrived Saturday ) :<br /><br />&quot;Holy fuck, my man. So, um, I got my package today... WOW. They should have anointed you the god dammed Pope instead! I&#039;m so happy I tripped over my own boner trying to get to my lighter. You make me love throwing money at you. Thank you.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; Ps: if anyone with posting rights to rumor mill would be good enough to copy and paste this review in the Mill, I&#039;d appreciate it. It&#039;s awful that the last review there is a negative one. That is not what this guy is all about AT ALL. Long live my man Weed Indeed!<br />

				This is my first review, so take it easy on me!<br /><br />I ordered a QP of Weed Indeed&#039;s Atomic Northern Lights for 615 USD.<br />-Communication: This vendor had all relevant information on his profile.&nbsp; He updated his profile 2 days after I placed my order to let everyone who had ordered know that he had been in an accident and that orders would be delayed.<br />-Shipping: After the delay, WI said that all order would be shipped by Friday and mine was.&nbsp; It arrived Monday to my surprise, so I couldn&#039;t have been more pleased with the shipping.<br />-Stealth: I can&#039;t remember if WI had 2 or 3 Vac seals, but there was no smell at all and the stealth was good.&nbsp; Not great like some of the vendors, but it was more than sufficient and was very inconspicuous.<br />-Smell: As soon as I cut off the last vac seal, my entire 4-person apartment was inundated with a very pungent scent with a hint of spice.&nbsp; A pleasant smelling strain, you can smell it from a good distance away.<br />-Looks: WI described this as &quot;mids&quot; which isn&#039;t doing it justice.&nbsp; The buds are well trimmed for the most part, many good sized nugs and no shake.&nbsp; These nugs are lighter green covered with lots of trichs and hairs.<br />-Effects: This Atomic NL is a very nice smoke.&nbsp; The sativa effects kick in within 3 hits, as I can feel my thought process start to speed up, but after about 10 minutes the indica effects that NL is famous for really start to take hold.&nbsp; This strain is better for nighttime than daytime, for me, but you can still smoke it and function during the day if need be.<br />-Overall: I was extremely pleased with WI.&nbsp; His combination of price and quality is hard to find on the SR, and I definitely plan on being a repeat customer.
