				Avoid Tunbear at all costs.<br /><br />vendor http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/36f4b4c12e<br /><br />Placed an order on the 1st April. 2 1/2 gs of coke.&nbsp; Received a message from the vendor to FE on the 2nd, despite me having 0% refund rate for 30 transactions.&nbsp; The reason he gave was that &quot;there was a lot of a scamming coke heads on here&quot; ---- the irony... So i Fe&#039;d and Tunbear has done a houdini ever since.<br /><br />Looking through his feedback it seems he&#039;s doing over quite a few people at the minute...and strangely doesnt have 1 feedback comment for coke, yet still has the listings live??<br /><br />I have sent tunbear a message every day since, without reply even though he is online.&nbsp; Not a dickey-bird - nothing.&nbsp; <br />*AVOID*<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Well, I ordered from him around a week ago, and haven&#039;t heard a word from him since or even had the chance to FE. I messaged him and got nothing back. <br /><br />I read through his profile though and he mentioned being in hospital last month, and asking a friend to take over for him. Since he has been on his SR account but not on the forums, I&#039;m assuming this is the case. <br /><br />A massive fuck on for me, but the last thing I want is for him to cancel the order, because when I ordered i payed ~£25, now they&#039;re probably worth £5-10 or something due to the price crash. To get them refunded would be fucking pointless, I&#039;d of basically sat and waited a week, and lost ~£20. Fuck it though, if it turns out he&#039;s been on hospital or something like that, I wont blame him for it. <br /><br />Good luck sorting your problem mate, I&#039;m guessing a lot of people are currently trying to contact him with similar problems at the minute. Let me know if you get a response at all.

				Ordered 1grm of coke of Tunbear about 3 weeks ago. Came within 2 days. Dont know what it was cut with though?<br />A lot of it wouldnt dissolve and kept getting hard gritty lumps of it in my throat, like crushed tablets. <br /><br />Anyway thats just my two pennys worth on quality but did arrive.<br />&nbsp;<br />I know he has been in and out of hospital which isnt his fault but then he shouldnt be selling if he cant fullfill orders!

				I&#039;ve ordered MXE from Tunbear in the past without issue, product seemed alright.<br /><br />Because of this, on Sunday I ordered again without really checking feedback or on the forums. Now I see that loads of people have had problems, and all his listings have been pulled (by SR I&#039;m assuming, because they&#039;ve been pulled since he was &quot;last seen&quot;).<br /><br />Looking at my order, it says I have 3 more days to wait until I can cancel. Is there any way I can do this sooner, I&#039;d rather just have the BC back and order something else if the shit has hit the fan with this vendor.<br /><br />Also, will a cancelled order show up negatively on my account? I have 100% no refunds or auto-finalise and wanna keep my account looking clean! :D

				I&#039;ve sent messages out on SR but thought I&#039;d post here. I&#039;ve not read any of the messages I got (there was 300+)<br /><br />Anyone who lost out on MXE will get their MXE and a 50% refund, those that lost out on coke will get a bit extra.<br /><br />Send me your order number, your address and what you ordered. this only applies to those that lost out, IE it auto finalized or you finalized yourself.<br /><br />I can only apologize for my absence however no explanations will be given, I will simply attempt to restore my rep<br /><br />NOBODY WAS SCAMMED I can&#039;t say this enough. My business brought in a LOT of money, the most I would have got away with was $1000 which is all that&#039;s left in my account - vendor support mostly resolved most situations and did 100% refunds

				Normally this would be a point of &quot;none of your fucking business&quot; but I better play nice until I sort everything out.<br /><br />Coke buyers are asked to FE because of the shit I see other coke vendors go through with users. I dunno how much he ordered yet but it can&#039;t have been more than a few hundred quids worth tops - I use Silk Road about an hour a day and make a very comfortable living, scamming people over such a tiny amount of money is retarded. Look at my MXE sales, I was #1 for everywhere except US, and made more money on that in a week that I would on coke in a year.<br /><br />I barely sold any coke and as far as I can tell only a few users actually lost out, but as I said, they&#039;ll be taken care of.<br /><br />One note I&#039;d like to make abundantly clear is that although Silk Road seems like some sort of drugs mecca where you deal with guys who just happen to sort you quality products out, it&#039;s not - it&#039;s a drug dealing website where you&#039;re buying from people who sell extremely illegal substances and in some cases deal with extremely unpleasant people, so from time to time shit will happen to them.<br /><br />Gimme 2 weeks, you&#039;ll see my rating go back to it&#039;s rightful place ;) (unless there&#039;s arseholes out there who truly wanna hold a grudge, or don&#039;t want to believe me, in that case it might go longer while they can go fornicate themselves with an object that has more points on it than stars in the sky)<br /><br />Oh and if anyone messages me bugging me about orders they put in that weren&#039;t confirmed so they simply had to cancel will just be ignored, I had no control over my account, you&#039;re free to remake the order but the amount of abuse I&#039;m going to have to deal with until this is all sorted is going to end up with me getting nasty and ending up with an even worse rep

				Asking customers to FE is shady. There&#039;s a reason there is a system in place to protect both the buyer and the seller. Circumventing the system and then not delivering doesn&#039;t look good at all. I used to sell that product on the street, so I understand the kind of customer you get. I changed products because of that after a few years. However, I can&#039;t see the logic in telling people to circumvent the escrow system that the SR staff oversees to avoid fraud on here. The escrow system is there to avoid just that.

				About 3 or 4 people tops ended up not getting stuff because shit happened at a bad time, coke is only thing I ask to FE on, and it&#039;s worked out fine up until this situation, yet those that did lose out have gotten extra coke so I&#039;d say it&#039;s worked out great all round..

				I had the same issue with him, I ordered some MXE and then he apparently went AWOL. So I cancelled my order, the next day he messaged me regarding his situation. He didn&#039;t go into specifics, I didn&#039;t want to know really either. <br /><br />I looked back at his profile page and it mentions that he has been in hospital before. So I figured that he had not infact done a runner, he was probably back in the hospital, ill, busted or anything else could have suddenly cropped up. <br /><br />The fact that his rep has taken a massive hit, and then he came back and messaged as many people as he could is good, right? People are too quick to jump on the &quot;he&#039;s a scammer&quot; bandwagon. He is trying to make amends by offering sweeteners on all the orders people missed out on. <br /><br />Give the lad a break, and if you&#039;ve left negative feedback have the decency to change it now you know the situation.

				Well after a mildly long story, Tunbear ended up threatening me, due to him having my address. I then didn&#039;t hear from him for a while, even thought it always said last online today. <br /><br />I messaged SR support asking what to do and they suspended his account after they read his messages to me. I did however receive my MXE so it isn&#039;t all bad. <br /><br />I am not going into details but another vendor on SR works with Tun and the other person scammed me for £500 and I asked Tun to have a word and that is when he threatened me. <br /><br />Overall not a very good experience. Hopefully I get my money back and Tun gets his account back.

				Wondering if Tunbear will be back. I&#039;ve bought 10 grams of MXE from him multiple times but this last shipment has taken 3 weeks and has yet to arrive, whereas normally it takes a week.<br /><br />No reply to PM either. 240€ lost if he&#039;s gone for good. Oh well, lesson learned - never let it autofinalize no matter how many times you&#039;ve done business with the vendor in question. :/

				As some of you were aware health issues had me in and out of, and then pretty much confined to hospital for a while, so I had to find someone suitable to run it for me..but finding someone who knows about drug dealing, knows computers, and has good people skills is not exactly easy. It wasn&#039;t until my cousin got off holiday right towards the end that he settled all MXE outgoings, ALL open ones were sent, any that didn&#039;t arrive I wash my hands of, a lot I sent recorded delivery because of their shit stats and I&#039;ve been reading through my messages and they all got 100% refunds even though I KNOW they received their stuff.<br /><br />penakki if you&#039;re penttike&nbsp; you did indeed have 1 shipped, but you finalized early so I&#039;ll do a reship for you, but as you know your country is hard as balls to ship into, if this one doesn&#039;t get through then I&#039;m sorry bro I&#039;m not reshipping or refunding. I took a massive dive on money because of scammers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve sold all my stock and will be taking a cut and will be working with a team to help them get on their feet and learn the ins and outs, and to smooth a few things over.<br /><br />lucy is right, I flipped out after some shit went down, said some shit I shouldn&#039;t have (at least not on SR..you can say shit outside of it and they won&#039;t do fuck all) but I was in the wrong with that and as soon as their business is up and running you&#039;ll be paid back. It was bad timing as the funds were being automatically moved to pay for a load of legal highs I was expanding into.<br /><br />The threat, although not real and me just being a dick, was not me threatening to post your address, I&#039;d never do that, I was just fucked off and was being super childish in saying I was gonna come pay you a visit. TBH I can&#039;t even remember if it was me making the threat or someone else but it&#039;s best I take the blame at this point.<br /><br />The last online thing wasn&#039;t me being online...I think. I doubt it anyway, as I had my cousin controlling my account. Now all my stock is going back up under BitcoinsUK, a team has been formed where 1 side will deal with bitcoin sales and the other with drug sales. The bitcoin sale bit is offline until I sort out some security issues.<br /><br />My MXE is intact, I&#039;ll still be around to take the flaming or whatever but NO RESHIPS WILL GO OUT. It seems I can&#039;t trust anyone and this will follow through in the new business.<br /><br />It will be expanding to lots of legal highs, bud (UK only), and of course my MXE. Although there will be a maximum of 3.5g per order, so all orders go in a letter, no more parcels, no more recorded deliveries, 50% reships and after that you agree to pay. For the legal highs it&#039;ll be a little bit different. Originally the prices I was going to be getting them at was the same as MXE (£1500/kilo) but because it&#039;s not me selling them I can&#039;t get that price, and lack of funds mean buying lower quantities, so my margins are razor tight. These are legal highs so there will be no reships unless proof that it has been seized.<br /><br />Oh and if you&#039;re in Russia/n countries, Africa, or Australia/east Asia, it&#039;s finalize early or don&#039;t order.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to personally apologize to anyone who got caught up in all this bullshit, and especially to lucy, you&#039;ll get double what you order on MXE (not affordable on the legal highs thats how razor thin the profit margins are) until I can afford to pay you off. I doubt you&#039;d wanna work with BitcoinsUK again, especially as we both had occasations that caused major fuck ups of both our faults, but he still works with some ppl and has a good arrangement, but as I say it&#039;s probably best if we end that relationship.<br /><br />Expect all listings to be up within the next few hours<br /><br />Nobody bother me about reships etc. it&#039;s out of my hands now and the guy I sold it to has no responsibility whatsoever. Penttike will get a reship as well as 1 Australian guy I can&#039;t recall the name of, but as I can&#039;t seem to get paid for the stuff I send I&#039;m just not gonna bother as I don&#039;t know who to trust.<br /><br />Oh and as an extra kick in the bollocks, I sent one of the last £1000 worth of coins to a guy to get money together to both pay lucy and get started back up again but made a spelling mistake. Contacted him right away he said he&#039;d contacted vendor support (which I already had done) to &quot;clear it up&quot; he was full of shit he stole my money. I doubt he kept his account going but anyone seeing anything from citizencane he&#039;s a thieving little toerag

				Oh and lucy you weren&#039;t scammed, the deal was for you to send £500 then another £500 as it had to be moved instantly, which was done by a script. Because you didn&#039;t send the second £500, and it was going to the same person you fucked about last time (he was supposed to pay £1000 for coins but THAT SAME DAY made extremely clear and it caused a massive problem for bitcoinsUK), he decided not to send the coins or something like that. But BitcoinsUK has said he&#039;d pay you back.<br /><br />And why does everyone keep going on about me being online, I&#039;ve mentioned at least a dozen times that I have a refresh script, not to mention the person who was handling my orders. He just never did resolution centre or answered my messages, all he was there for was to do the new orders.
