				Tried speed for the first time on Saturday, got sick about 24h after last dose. I really hope that you guys can tell me if this is part of the comedown/crash, or that it is unrelated? <br /><br />Did some small lines, started at&nbsp; Saturday 11:00 in the morning and took the last at 18:00, so only used some in this 7 hour time span. Don&#039;t have a scale so can&#039;t comment on the quantity of the doses exactly, but I think it wasn&#039;t much in total as I got only a gram, and only used a very small amount of this gram.<br />Had a nice energy buzz and euphoria, felt very nice. Did skip lunch, but had breakfast and a proper dinner that day. Did drink regularly. With the help of a benzo I had no trouble sleeping at night, slept for 7 hours, woke up feeling pretty good in the morning after.<br /><br />At around 18:00 on Sunday (24 hours after last line) I started to feel flashes of heat and cold, and had a very intense nausea, also felt very weak. Felt like a proper fever/flu, but with a very sudden come up. At some point I had to throw up, feeling a bit better afterwards. Felt pretty shit for the rest of the evening, went to bed early.<br />The next morning the alarm clock woke me after 8 hours of sleep. I felt completely devastated! Took a while to get out of bed. Called work to say I wont come in today, and went back to bed. Slept for 4 more hours, still feeling like shit when I got out of bed. It&#039;s Monday evening now, do have some food in me, and I&#039;m feeling a fair bit better but still not 100%...<br /><br />I really hope you guys can tell me, given the timeline, if this could be the result of using the speed, or if it probably is unrelated? Was about to flush this stuff down the drain, but would be a waste if the speed isn&#039;t to blame :p

				I&#039;ve never really heard of anything like this happening because of speed use. Probably unrelated, but I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />Sounds like you actually just have the flu or something, probably just a coincidence. All drugs usually mess with your immune system, and amphetamines are no exception. I guess this might explain why you&#039;re sick right now.

				Back when I first started taking amphetamines, they wrecked my immune system.&nbsp; I&#039;m not talking like, suppression... they almost fucking assassinated it.&nbsp; This was pharmaceutical amphetamine, by the way, so presumably pure (or pure enough anyway).<br /><br />It&#039;s entirely possible that it&#039;s excellent, pure amphetamine -- and that amphetamine does the same thing to you that it used to do to me.&nbsp; Now my immune system is shockingly good (considering I&#039;m an amphetamine junkie), but it doesn&#039;t necessarily imply anything at all about the speed you&#039;ve got.<br /><br />Also, I often feel like I&#039;ve suddenly caught a full blown cold when I&#039;m crashing... a little like a mild flu almost.&nbsp; It&#039;s really weird, but it happens like half the time.&nbsp; Don&#039;t really know why, and it always goes away by the time I&#039;ve woken up -- little different than your experience, but it may be related somehow, I dunno.<br />

				I would bet it had nothing to do with what you took. Sounds like it could bethe&nbsp; Noro Virus that is going around the States.. This current strain was first identified in Sydney, Australia. Makes you sick as hell for 24 to 48hrs

				Different drugs effects everyone differently. Maybe amphetamine is not for you

				I don&#039;t get sick after using speed, but during my heavy coke days (consisting of binges lasting up to 3 days) I&#039;d ALWAYS come down with a cold or something once I took a break.
