				Just joined SilkRoad about a month ago and so far have 2 successful purchases from 2 extremely nice sellers. Bought 1/4 ounce golden shrooms from one seller and some Galindoi (I think) pills from another. Both came super quickly and discretely and the experience itself was amazing! I couldn&#039;t be happier with the whole thing.<br /><br />That said - I have a couple of questions.<br /><br />1. I get that as a new user I can only post in the Newbie section, but when do I become a normal user? I want to post reviews and share my experiences.<br /><br />2. I most definitely want to do the mushrooms thing again. Last time I did 1/8th ounce of the golden shrooms + 3 pills of the Galindoi + 2 advils (for the stomach pain) and I was extremely happy, feelings were great, there was a little bit of visuals but mostly just a general feeling that everything is substantial, I am special, and the world revolves around me :). Say money was no object - what are the B E S T shrooms there are?&nbsp; If I was willing to spend more, what can I get that would really give me an even better feeling?

				you need to spam the newbie board til 50 post, then you will be allowed to post in rest of the forums.<br /><br />in my opinion the best shrooms you can get your hands on is north Norwegian flein shrooms.<br />however, its a wild season shroom which is available only once a year, so it is kinda rare on world basis.<br />usually wont get further than DK or SWE before it runs out.<br /><br />i am trying to get in contact with a mate from there, to arrange import which i would sell on SR aswell, but since its only available a few weeks during fall, it probably wont happen until next season.<br />(unless i am lucky and he still got this seasons stock available) i had one guy who kept flein from each year, never selling them, only giving away at occasions to friends, free, since the shooms told him to the first time he found them.<br />however he got raided during Christmas so hes unavailable at the moment.

				Wow, Please message me if you&#039;re going to get some of those!&nbsp; Other than the Flein shrooms, anything on SilkRoad right now that&#039;s worth the extra premium?

				i have not tried the shrooms on SR, so cant really promote any vendor or product, as it would be wrong on my part.<br />the reason for this is because i am looking into 2C-B which is a synthetic psycadelic. my friend told me this was almost as good as flein, so i thought i would try some.<br /><br />also a good dosage would be 15-25 mg if you decide to try this.<br />waiting mine next week.

				HONESTLY the Best mushrooms available are ones you grow due to the fact you know exactly where they have been and how they have <br />been dried and over time active compounds in shrooms break down the longer they are sitting dried so if you get shrooms from a vendor here<br />who knows where they got it from so on and so forth.. the reason why shrooms are so high priced here is because majority of the vendors are middle manning so who the fuck knows where they got their shrooms they sell let alone how long they have been sitting around before you get them... I mean i ordered an OZ of Texas cubes from ROCKER before the vendor threw in the towel and guess what the quality wasnt as good as i got locally not to mention i got a OZ of stems basically just because of the facts stated above not the fault of the vendor just the facts.... if you want a good psychedelic get LSD from Tessellated the high is better you dont get sick and it lasts longer LSD is just over-all better. the only draw back which really isnt a draw back for most is your high for 8-12 hours..

The strongest (I wouldn&#039;t say the best cuz I kinda flipped out) trip I had on shrooms was from a batch I grew myself. It was an indian strain that grows on elephent dung, to give you an idea of the kind of potency I was dealing with lol XD
