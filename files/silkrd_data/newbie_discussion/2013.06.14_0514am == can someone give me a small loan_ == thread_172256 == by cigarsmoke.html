				A lot of vendors on SR are really good people, message him and tell him your dilemma. Perhaps, the vendor would be willing to work with you for the $2 rather than hitting someone up on here for it.

				Wait a little more. If he has given the funds via wallet it can take more than an hour.<br /><br />Account transfer is much faster. Sadly I don&#039;t have enough waste atm or I would send them you myself. Wait a little more and if the deposit doesn&#039;t arrive bump the thread.
