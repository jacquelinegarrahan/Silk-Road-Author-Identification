				Hey there<br /><br />I recently received my slice of true og kush and wanted to write a quick review.<br /><br />This og kush is indeed as advertised; true og kush.<br /><br />The stuff is extremely stinky, as og should. I only got a slice but the nuggets were nice, classic og smallish&nbsp; dense popcorn buds and 2 slightly larger buds.<br /><br />Fully trichome&#039;d out and sticky to touch, which was very relieving to see. Hahaha. Really not much stem at all so it was pretty much all smoke @ 4.0g. Excellent. Again, classic og characteristics. <br /><br />So on to the smoke. Well, it is pretty damn satisfying. The inhale is a thick smoke of petrol like piney tasting protectiveness which goes straight to the head and instantly relaxes the entire body and mind. <br /><br />Upon exhale I am now smiling and coughing at the same time. Very potent kush and makes my eyes and forehead sweat a bit. Cool.<br /><br />My only complaint with the og is that in my opinion it could have been flushed a bit better.........it&#039;s just not perfectly white ash, but also not some sticky ass nasty black tar ash shit.<br /><br />I highly recommend this og kush. Btw this was from his AAA og kush batch that was phenomenal; I guess now he has AA og kush (just not as good a batch, so it is priced less which is wise)<br /><br />The communication/shipping/delivery was spot on and will definitely order again.
