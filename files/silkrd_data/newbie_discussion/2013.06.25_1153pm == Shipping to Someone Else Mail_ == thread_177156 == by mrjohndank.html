				I am wanting to try pot, but I am trying to keep it on the down low. I am curious if I am living with someone, and I were to ship edibles to that address, do you think that would be smart, or better to wait to separate,&nbsp; then start it? I sometimes get the mail, but sometimes others do, and they like to do mail call (yeah I know). I usually don&#039;t get much mail, so would that be suspect?

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it, if you were shipping class A drugs to your address thats when you need to start worrying. If you are shipping less then $50 worth of weed you&#039;d be fine.<br /><br />I have P.O box addresses, mail drop box addresses, pre paid debit cards etc for my Class A drugs but when it comes to prescription drugs I order (Valium, Viagra etc) and Skunk I send it straight to my house as long as under $25 for me.<br /><br />You mind me asking you said you want to try pot? Would this be your first time? If so do you not have any street dealers available? May be the best option for your first ever deal

				Yeah, first time. I was thinking of buying some pot gum or candy I believe it was. I don&#039;t want to bring anymore attention to myself than necessary. Matter of fact, a few people have asked me for a smoke, which IDK if they meant dank or just a smoke. I have thought about capitalizing on this by drop shipping (since there is not many dealers, and from what I hear, the next dealer is like a hour away, but then again that could be wrong). So I am thinking chewing the gum, and see how it goes. Would it be ok to walk around town with edibles in your system? and on an off topic, I would like to know a little about mail drops, but for other reasons ;) .

I am UK so unfortunately everything I know about mail drops may not be helpful for you as the companies and ways I use are all UK based, sorry man but lurk the forum and search drop addresses you will find all you need to know&nbsp; ;D.
