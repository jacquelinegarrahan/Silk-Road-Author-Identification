				Hello guys<br />Im new to silk road and i need some advice, my friend from a different area of australia recommended silk road to me so i thought i would give it a try as he said he never had any problems, last week i got some bit coins and made two seperate orders of .5 grams of mdma from two vendors with high reputations, over a week passed and nothing ever showed up so i messaged both vendors and they both provided express post australia tracking numbers which state that the packages both arrived and were delivered the NEXT DAY after i paid for it, which seems really strange to me, i paid the vendors late in the day on tuesday, and they both state &quot;arrived at facility&quot;, then &quot;on truck with driver for scheduled delivery&quot; then &quot;delivered&quot; all on WEDNESDAY.<br />I have been checking every single day and nothing has shown up, what is even weirder is that i looked on the postal website and it states that express post is not available to darwin and perth? So now i have two vendors with tracking codes wanting to finalize and no packages whatsoever?<br />What do you guys think happened and what do you recommend i do?

				i dont recommend the above advice.<br />did&nbsp; you fe? if so maybe they have scammed you and given you a tracking number that is completed for someone elses order. <br />if you are in perth and they are sending outside of wa then it normally takes longer than the overnight / arriving next day, normally it takes a few days. so that is a bit suspicious i guess. <br />unfortunately not much you can really do. <br />oh i just reread that you did fe. all you can do is call out the vendors on the forums or on the discussions. goto sr resolution but they will probably rule in favour of the vendor so you will lose your money. then you can leave feedback for the vendor. <br />sorry this happened, but you should never fe.
