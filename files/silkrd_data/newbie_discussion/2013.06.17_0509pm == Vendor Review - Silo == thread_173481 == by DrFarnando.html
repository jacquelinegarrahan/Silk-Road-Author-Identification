				I feel the need to pay my respects to Silo, whom I just dealt with for the first time. Right now he is running a deal for a free sample of 25c-NBOMe. Well, actually, FIVE free samples (excluding shipping): http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d77446f14b. I sent him a message after I ran into some funding issues, and got an almost immediate reply. Not only did he offer to cover the shipping fees for me and was extremely polite, he gave me some very useful advice on street profits. I can&#039;t recommend this vendor enough, and am very eagerly anticipating the 25c-NBOMe. That is one chemical I have not tried. Have any other n00bs had any good experiences with him? I&#039;ll post trip reports when I get the product :).

				on sublingual/oral 1,500 micrograms right now. added 500 micrograms (about 6 hours, i think, after the initial dose) while i gave my friend 1,000 micrograms. we smoked some of &quot;ringo deathstarr&quot;s DMT in the car outside the house. a 55mg bag i weighed out in a filtering flash to vape it got us both blasted off. it should be noted i&#039;m on 20mg of OxyMorphone and 40mg Methylphenidate a day... i went first.<br /><br />the body load wasn&#039;t a load... it was euphoria like i have never known. my tired bones and weak flesh became flooded with... light (?). my friend, a female, looked even more beautiful than ever. i told her that i could see her energy, and that it was beautiful (she&#039;s an incredible person... attractive, but still a virgin at 20, smokes pot , though is taking a &#039;tolerance break&#039; right now, and is curious about psychedelics and not about my needles&amp;narcotics like most). the closed eye visuals were the racing, snaking, geometric, beautifully simple ones i expect from DMT. i tried to push through the light... i saw two stereotypical aliens and projected that they disapproved of me (because of my infected hand from IV&#039;ing... and IV&#039;ing in general). then, a stereotypical god (old white man with a beard and a white robe &lt;eye roll&gt;) appeared and chased them off. i took this to mean, even if there was a god (besides you and me), he wouldn&#039;t want me to suffer; he would encourage hedonism. i felt at peace with everything, and the edgy feeling coming down off the initial 25c-NBOMe dose was completely dispelled. i call DMT &quot;playing death&quot; as it is what death will be. i know i could die today and have a content afterlife though.<br /><br />i cannot comment on my friend&#039;s experience. it is too personal for her to have adequately explained to me even. we had some telepathic moments though (and i&#039;ve been hanging out with her a week or so... she was a co-worked turned friend). like using the exact word the other person stopped, unable to think of. or perfectly explaining a phenomenon that was occurring. after blasting off, i returned the flask inside, and we drove to a park. we walked around, laid on the asphalt looking at the nite, laid on the grass listening to music, it was all incredible. when my friend dropped me off at home, i ate a little and turned on the TV for a little. i&#039;ve become a &quot;Grey-A demisexual&quot; since my fiance died... but, i found myself aroused. things felt really good... and i had an afterglow (doesn&#039;t happen without a partner for me). i would love to try the 25c-NBOMe with someone who was into me and i was into them....<br /><br />silo&#039;s 25c-NBOMe blotters are worth every BTC.<br />ringo deathstarr&#039;s DMT is as well.<br /><br />this comes from an experienced cosmonaut (i have HPPD; constant tracers and white walls are non-existent to me)...<br /><br /><br />my friend and i plan to split the last 1.5mgs of 25c-NBOMe today... then when feeling it, blast off with DMT and blowing out the last hit, start on some nitrous. i&#039;ve only fully left this reality/dimension twice... once was from an absurdly strong Salvia D. extract. the second was peaking on an 1/8th of shrooms, i blasted off DMT, then followed with nitrous (as i speak of doing today). back tonite with more praises for &quot;silo&quot; and &quot;ringo deathstarr&quot; for sure!

				A copy of the message I sent Ringo about yesterday....<br /><br />Yesterday, we dosed 750 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe each... and went out and bought three big cans of whipped cream with my food stamps (haha... i took a picture of my purchase on the self-checkout stand... three cans of whipped cream and a thing of sprite, the 25c causes nausea). we blasted off and as we blew out our last hit each, hit nitrous. it was indescribable. and my friend laid her head on my chest. i got to experience death in the arms of someone who has given me nothing but positive energy. it was the most connected i&#039;ve ever felt to another person. she chose to cuddle with me when she blasted off. we ended up drinking later and watching a movie.... made-out. she&#039;s 20 and a virgin (thought those only existed in middle-school, didn&#039;t you? ha)... i&#039;m a man-whore; i&#039;ve literally sold my body to both sexes (and to a really hot girl one time actually) as well as a brief career as a stripper (the half-way house made me quit, who would have thought?). i&#039;ve been date-raped by two girls (twice by one). my view of sex is FUCKED. i&#039;m honest with my friend though; and she appreciates it and is helping me keep things at a healthy pace. seriously, my late fiance and i did speedballs once... and after 15 minutes and the &quot;rush&quot; subsiding looked at each other and asked, &quot;were we just fucking like crazy? you felt that too?&quot; there was a foot of space between us. with my new friend, yesterday i felt like cuddling with her was like &quot;making love&quot; and wanted a cigarette after. so different, but similar. narcotics resulted in a shared feeling of FUCKING (primal, physical) while the psychedelics resulted in a shared feeling of MAKING LOVE (emotional, tender).<br /><br />i am re-ordering my &quot;Fireball&quot; supplies today (and i think my friend wants some more of your DMT, she loves it and i feel 100% okay with her doing it... not like an old friend who loved my 3-MeO-PCP IV....); and i know that i will be able to put the needle down after i do it. I KNOW IT. and your DMT has played a major part in this.<br /><br />thank you so much, my friend.... you&#039;ve helped me return from the dead.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Lots-of-Love,<br />~f.xy<br /><br />P.S.- blasted off yesterday AM by myself... here&#039;s what i wrote:<br /><br />DMT philosophy....<br /><br />patterns are present with the CEVs. what are patterns but habits? what are habits but rules? what are rules but laws? this is why mankind shirks away from anarchy as a whole. i do not know what political system is best; other than &quot;narco&quot; should be included in the word.<br /><br />back to the beautiful, unspoiled laws inside my eyelids....<br /><br />a government&#039;s only role should be providing nutritious food, adequate shelter, medical care, justice, and drugs (both narcotics and psychedelics) to those who can&#039;t take care of providing themselves with those thing.
