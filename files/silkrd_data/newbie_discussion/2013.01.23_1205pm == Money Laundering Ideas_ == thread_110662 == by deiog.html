				My method is a little OCD, but generally, I prefer to launder my money on gentile in a High Efficiency, front loading washer with some Tide (with beach alternative only! Don&#039;t want to bleach out the bills!). Only then is it clean enough for me to handle; MONEY IS DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY!

				SWIM likes to launder money through any cash business. Seems like a no brainier, but there are many ways to do this. If you live in the US, the housing market is shit so cheap houses can be bought in most cities/towns for under $10,000. Pay workers to fix it up to rentable status and only pay them cash. Then you rent the place out. If you plan well (or better yet, hire a decent GC), you should have a rent able house for under market value and no way for the IRS to tell how much you actually spent fixing it up. Then NEVER sell it and keep a nice rental income flowing. Do this many times. Try to keep the houses close together. Fix them up fairly nicely (you don&#039;t want to have to deal with bull shit repairs all the time). <br /><br />Of course this only works if you have a pretty good chunk of change to launder and you don&#039;t constantly need your cash to re-up. <br /><br />BTW, all of this (except the part about not declaring what you spent on the house to the IRS) can be found by searching &quot;real estate development&quot;<br /><br />Unfortunately, most good plans for laundering money only really work if you have a shit ton to launder. If you fall into that category, I&#039;m guessing you wouldn&#039;t be browsing the newbie posts for ideas on how to wash your cash.<br />

				Money laundering is relatively a simple process, and depending on how much you are laundering, easy. If it&#039;s for relatively small amounts, use trusted online casinos.
