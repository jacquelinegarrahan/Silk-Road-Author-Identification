				Someone should start a postal service that only tests parcels for weapons explosives etc and not other contraband. They would get so much business and they wouldn&#039;t knowingly be transporting contraband because they wouldn&#039;t know what was in the packages.

				The laws are there, and legal businesses, like postal outlets and shipping companies, have to abide by them.<br />Customs will search packages, regardless of company policies, at point of entry.<br />It would be nice, but it cannot happen in this current climate.<br />Between terrorism and drugs, LE are waving their magic wands over the mail every chance they get.

				Yeah, you can&#039;t just make a business that doesn&#039;t include customs. If you&#039;re importing anything, they have to know and have the right to check it.. Federal law &gt; Your business&#039; rules

				The U.S.A. Federal Government already operates a legalized monopoly over the postal system.&nbsp; It is illegal for anyone to deliver 1st class mail despite the fact that they can&#039;t even afford to keep their doors open on weekends.&nbsp; They would simply never allow you to do anything of the sort.&nbsp; They simply play by their own rules.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure if you have a few hundred million dollars around you could attempt to start your own shipping company to compete with them on their non-monopolized products and likely fail do to government interference.&nbsp; If you read the reviews of quality vendors, they clearly don&#039;t struggle on out maneuvering this ineffective bureaucracy.&nbsp; The U.S.A. Postal Service is in a constant state of begging for more tax revenue to make up for their bad business model.&nbsp; There is simply no reason to think that they will pull their shit together to an extent that they can afford to increase mail security.&nbsp; So why re-create the wheel.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
