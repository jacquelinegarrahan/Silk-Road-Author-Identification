				Hi all I just recently ordered some stuff coming from Los Angeles and all have all been marked as &quot;Last departed sort facility...&quot; probably about 10 days ago.&nbsp; These things that I ordered are not illegal so I&#039;m not worried about them getting opened or anything but I thought that it was kind of fishy for three things to get lost at the same time coming from the same city.&nbsp; Is there something going on in Cali?&nbsp; Or should I be worried about getting other things in the mail in the future?&nbsp; Thanks!

				Yes as a matter of fact!&nbsp; We have been starting to get a black eye as a result of lack of competency with USPS!<br /><br />In the forums you are seeing transit times with priority going 6 - 10 - to over 21 days!&nbsp; And of course the vendors are taking the hits!<br />There are several threads all discussing the long transit times now since USPS has been trying to consolidate &amp; save money.&nbsp; I believe it is worse in Calif than most states since there are more places to consolidate than most.&nbsp; There have been more packages going missing as well which there is less talk about.<br /><br />NCK

				Could this be why I have not received my orders yet? :-\ Been around th5 days and I ordered from FiberOptic and Nawlins who seemed to have great stats. I highly doubt customs got them and this thread kinda explains a lot.
