				When my listings are up i am online and ready to trade! You will receive your coins as promptly as possible after ordering (usually less than 15 minutes).<br /><br />I have prior feedback in the newbie section. Check it out!<br />&nbsp;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188784.0<br /><br />Heres my profile<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1adc0b8d93<br /><br />I am now charging a fee of 10%.<br />Heres how it works.<br /><br />1. You got to a local store and buy a card i am currently accepting. (currently Vanilla Reload, ReLoadit)<br /><br />2. Put on the appropriate amount.<br />For example if you want $500 worth of btc<br />Pay 500 + 25(5% fee)+4(store fee)=$529<br /><br />3. Purchase listing and put the mp or rl code in the address field. Please specify what type of code it is. If you&nbsp; want your coins&nbsp; sent to an address other than your sr wallet, include your btc address.<br /><br />4. Wait for your coins. The amount you receive should show up in your sr account as exactly what you paid minus the fees. If you do not include an address to send the coins to they will be sent directly to your sr account and should show up immediately.<br /><br /><br />My listing will be up very soon at the address below. Just waiting for my coins to show up in my sr wallet then i will be good to go.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2228882ae7<br /><br />Any questions feel free to ask! Pleasse just read my listing and vendor page to get all the info first.

				How about this:&nbsp; I have two years worth of stats. About a 100 orders/$10,000 with only a $25.00 refund. Instead of me sending you my info, you FIRST deposit the BTC&#039;s in my account, less 10%. Then I send you the card info.&nbsp; &nbsp;Would you feel comfortable with that.....just checking.

				how would this exactly work?<br /><br />go to a local shop that sells the RELOADIT card (CVS or something) and then load it up with the amount of cash I want to exchange for BTC + 5% fee?<br /><br />then provide you with the RELOADIT card number and then you will send over the equivalent amount of BTC?<br /><br />if that is the case, then is it recommended to send directly to the SR address or open up some BTC wallet (any recs) and then transfer from that wallet into SR?<br /><br />is there any protection from you running away with the money once the card number is provided? besides the $500 vendor fee reason?<br /><br />thanks!

				I will actually be doing moneypak instead as they are more widely available it seems. <br /><br />And you got the process down right. I should have that info posted sorry but it will be on my listing when i get that up tomorrow. <br /><br />I could send the btc directly to you sr acount name from my vendor account. That would be faster than sending it to your SR btc address because then you have to wait for the coins to tumble. However if you wanted it sent to another wallet i could be happy to accommodate.<br /><br />And unfortunately their is nothing but my word to keep me&nbsp; from running with your cash. You could report the number as stolen i suppose.

				So I just received the bulk of my BTC now. MPJ is transferring the 5% mentioned in his listing back now.<br /><br />Seriously, this seller wants your business. It&#039;s frankly awesome to run into people who are engaged and online and ready to do the BTC shuffle. They were quick and communicative, the top traits that I look for in BTC merchants. I got a damn good deal on it, as well. Hopefully this seller explodes, because frankly they deserve to.<br /><br />If you are looking for more reassurance, you won&#039;t find it. Until MPJ is built up more, it does seem like a risk. My advice is just order already. MPJ will be the first person I pm when and if I transfer MPK.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />QWERTGBNH

				Just had the pleasure of doing business with MoneyPakJack and I have to say it was 5/5 all the way. He went out of his way to reach out to me and accommodate me with the lowest rate possible, and the promotion he&#039;s doing makes him unbeatable in my opinion. His responses were fast and I&#039;ve already got my btc within a few minutes of sending him the Moneypak code. I&#039;ll definitely keep him in mind next time I have some cash I want to turn into btc without any hassle&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Edit - He&#039;s already sent the 5% back for the promo, A+!

I Haven t received one apology yet. Fuck the financial system btc all the way! <br /><br />I will definitely have a&nbsp; larger stock this time around but at the rate i sold out last time im not sure how long this stock will last.

				Hey missus<br />I fill all order right when i get them, so at most i only have one or two at a time. So at most id only be getting away with one or two mp&#039;s... Plus your rep would destroy me haha. Lol not trying to pressure you just lettin ya know :). Anyway if you decide to order ReLoadits are preffered at this point im probably only going to be able to process a couple more mp&#039;s today. Thanks for lookin :)<br /><br />omega<br />You do not have to give a name or any information at all when purchasing a moneypak. Or show identification. You give me code, i send you coins :).

				I also just completed a transaction with MoneyPakJack.&nbsp; My usual bitcoin vendors were unavailable so I had to try someone new (always nerve wracking) and with the good reviews here I decided to try MoneyPakJack.&nbsp; He had my bitcoins in my SR wallet in about 10 minutes and with the most reasonable fees on SR.&nbsp; What can I say?&nbsp; This guy is legit and just what SR needs.&nbsp; Obtaining bitcoins can be difficult and filled with risk.&nbsp; <br />MoneyPakJack makes it easy and risk-free.

				Hey MPJ, quick question.<br /><br />When we input the amount we want in the address field should that be before or after the $3.95 reloadit charge?<br /><br />Example: I buy a reloadit card with $150 and I intend to spend all of that on BTC.<br /><br />Do I put &quot;$150&quot; in the address field or do I put &quot;$146.05&quot;?

				I can answer that question when you go and buy the card and you want 150 in coins you add his fee plus the 3.95 for the reload and sr fee of 4 bucks!&nbsp; $150 plus $4 Sr fee plus MPJ fee of %5 7:50 plus the 3:95 reload fee,<br />Total at checkout would be 165:45 hope this helps!<br />I had my coins in 6 minutes flat!
