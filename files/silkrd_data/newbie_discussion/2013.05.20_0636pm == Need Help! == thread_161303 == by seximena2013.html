				I am trying to figure out the best way to pay fro bitcoins to make my first purchase. I was thinking about going through bitistant because I can pay cash at my local Wal-Mart or CVS, but what I can not understand is if I get the bitcoins sent to my e-mail then how would I get them out of my e-mail and onto the SR website. Please help! Thanks

				I&#039;ve never used bitinstants btc to email service so I&#039;m not sure what kind of email your going to get, but I imagine the email will tell you what to do next.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always used the btc to btc address option and have them sent to my wallet.&nbsp; Never had any problems.&nbsp;

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				Setup a tormail.org account and send it to that email address.&nbsp; Then, create a wallet account from Block.Chain. Once you have made your cvs or walmart moneygram bill payment, you will receive two emails, one will be regarding the bitinstant transaction and the second will be from coinapult regarding your deposit.&nbsp; The 2nd email from coinapult&nbsp; will contain a transaction link, which takes you to the coinapult site. If you want to go directly to SR, at this point you can insert you SR account.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want that extra &quot;wash&quot; protection deposit to your Block,Chain wallet account.&nbsp; From there you can transfer by sending a money to you SR account from your wallet.&nbsp; This should all be performed using the Tor browser.

				How important is it to get Bitcoins anonymously?<br />If someone sends me Bitcoins wallet to wallet (like paying for a service I did to him), and then I send them to SR, will it be dangerous?

				The traceability is more difficult when a wallet to wallet transfer is made.&nbsp; I noticed some of the &#039;Hero&quot; members using this procedure as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a requirement, just an extra layer of protection.&nbsp; With the amount of phishing sites, and comprised accounts, some users prefer to store there bitcoins in another wallet for safety reasons, and transfer to SR as needed.
