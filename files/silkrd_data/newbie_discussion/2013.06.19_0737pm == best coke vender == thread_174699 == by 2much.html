				Bcpltd has taken 3 days to me every time, probably about 4+- orders and he&#039;s got some pretty good C. It varies sometimes but I&#039;ve never got anything that sucks. Just sometimes a little bettere vthsan others, but it&#039;s always been good. <br />If you want speed, order from Nod and choose his express option. He&#039;s pricey, he&#039;s fast and his quality is good.&nbsp; <br />There are plenty of others as well that ship express, I mention Nod because if ya get your order in B4 the time he mentions on his vendor page, it&#039;s guaranteed to go out that same day and USUALLY gets to ya the next day. I say usually because once in a while it takes 2, express guarantees delivery in no more than 2 days, but, depending on where your at it&#039;s more often than not the next day.

				USPS needs to mention, If you live in BFE always add an extra day to your expectation date.. I don&#039;t care if its priority, or express.. seems 4-5 days priority, 3 days express..

				I will vouch for bcpltd. Have ordered several times, quality is always great, shipping is generally two to three business days, stealth is good. He occasionally runs dry in between shipments I gather and often times he doesn&#039;t have a listing up but if you message he&#039;ll either put it up or make a custom listing. Always satisfied.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174699.msg1254566#msg1254566">Quote from: 2much on June 19, 2013, 08:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">THANKS!! i ask bout bcpltd cuz i placed an order last thursday and FE friday morning and product is yet to arrive..
