				First my name isn&#039;t really Bob, and I&#039;m not really an addict. With that aside, I do have some issues that hopefully someone passing by could give some insight into.<br /><br />Currently I&#039;ve been really battling myself to go see a psychologist or psychiatrist because of multiple personal and interpersonal problems I&#039;ve been having that seem to have been really escalating recently. Those&nbsp; being extremely lethargic mood, inability to concentrate, random manic phases where I&#039;m just full of energy just suddenly one night or day or extremely depressed the other. I also have a very hard time with social contact to the point where I typically don&#039;t even want to leave the house or pick up the phone, the latter being a detrimental factor in actually contacting a professional therapist(pathetic, I know). In addition I&#039;ve essential dropped out and given up on college at the moment and been out of work since the beginning of this past December, which the aforementioned issues being a large factor in both of those.<br /><br />With all that being said, I really was wondering if for one a therapist or psycholgist does actually help and if anybody has had experience with them. Secondly, I was curious if anybody knew anything in particular I could possibly take just so I can pick up the phone and talk to someone and be around people without dreading every second. I do take fluticasone propionate[prescribed](generic flonase?) and cetirizine(generic zyrtec) for some seasonal allergies, but I wouldn&#039;t think those would react badly with too much... though I don&#039;t know that for sure. Also on the addict front, I really don&#039;t think I would get addicted to anything... but I&#039;m sure ALL addicts have said that at some point.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope someone comes across this and has some helpful advice, any advice. Whether you do or you don&#039;t, thanks for at least stopping by and giving your time.<br /><br />---<br /><br />TL;DR life sucks, have serious problems with being around and talking to people and want something to help me overcome that so I can start tring to fix my life and make it suck less

				Hey not-Bob.<br /><br />I can relate to everything you said. I started using drugs to medicate myself and now 20 years down the line have had a series of habits. The only thing that has worked for me, apart from getting rid of the drug habits is a psychotherpist. I see her once a week and she rocks my world. Things have improved so much for me mentally, I wish I had dragged myself to one years ago.<br /><br />So yeah, I think talking about things with a professional helps, a lot.<br /><br />As for something to calm your anxiety, a little diazepam works the best, but is a bitch, I mean ABSOLUTE bitch to come off so do NOT get a habit.<br /><br />Go well and good luck.

				If you end up using Benzodiazepines make sure you don&#039;t use them too regularly. Only take a small dose when you really need it. Take it any more than once or twice a week and you will quickly build up an addiction. If you build up an addiction you will quickly find yourself physically dependent on them.<br /><br />As for psychotherapy, I&#039;m not sure. I saw a psychotherapist for a long time and I feel that it did not help me and actually stunted my maturity as well as making some of my problems worse.<br /><br />Self medication is probably a bad idea unless you have at least a rudimentary understanding of pharmacology, medicine and psychiatry.

I got a sample of 2-FMA with one of my last orders which is what really got me thinking about if it would be useful to start taking something, at least temporarily, to overcome some of my issues.

On the psychotherapy, I&#039;ve read a lot about it really depends on who you go to see. I&#039;ll probably end up trying a few and hope one of them will be able to help me out. I know self medicating probably isn&#039;t the best idea which is why I didn&#039;t want to start using anything for that reason... but as long as I use a little common sense it will probably be alright. I like to be well informed so anything that I do end up getting, I will have done quite a bit of research beforehand on effects, dosages, etc.

				benzos are not practical long term, they&#039;re good for short term, propranolol and other beta blockers are good for the physical side effects of anxiety, pregabalin is good for anxiety without having the long term implications on benzo use, first gen anti histamines like promethazine and hydroxyzine can help, low doses of atypical anti psychotics such as olanzapine can help, low dose anti depressants can also help.<br /><br />better than all of these long term is cognitive behavioural therapy and other forms of non prescription psychiatry<br /><br />also try having a break from drugs to see if that helps

I had a friend go through some depression, and once he got his issues taken care of, he said that it was amazing to feel normal. That feeling normal felt pretty good, and that when he was depressed it had never occurred to him that how he was feeling wasn&#039;t normal. But it&#039;s good you know somethings up.<br /><br />Start your search right now! Today could be the first day of the rest of your life, if you let it. Hope you can work on this to make yourself a better human being

				Hi bob, I think the first thing you need to do is to talk to somebody you can trust about your addiction. That might be a friend who already knows about your drug use to an extent or if you don&#039;t feel like you don&#039;t have anyone you can talk to, try and find a free phone mental health / drug abuse line you can call. A lot of the time just talking to someone on the other end of the phone even if they don&#039;t know you can help a lot.<br /><br />I saw that some other people have recommended benzos, but keep in mind that they are only a temporary crutch. They will only mask your anxiety / lift your mood while you are taking them. If you are prone to abusing drugs, benzos almost certainly aren&#039;t the path you want to take. Long term, you will end up taking more and more due to tolerance. If you do decide to go down the benzo route, ideally do so under the supervision of a doctor. <br /><br />If you decide to go without a doctor, i&#039;d recommend Etizolam. It&#039;s a short acting (6 hours or so) benzo-related drug which is uncontrolled in most countries. Compared to Diazepam, it is much shorter acting taking effect within 10-15 mins and lasting for 6 hours or so. As long as you keep the dose small (1 or 2mg per day) and have an infrequent dosing schedule you shouldn&#039;t build up too much of a tolerance. Keep in mind that withdrawing from benzos abruptly after long periods of regular use is similar to withdrawing from alcohol and can be extremely dangerous. You should gradually reduce your dosage if you&#039;ve been using them for longer than a few weeks without breaks.

				I&#039;ve suffered anxiety for 12 years after being mentally bullied by my manager in my previous job.<br /><br />I eventually sought counselling. Only had six sessions but they helped.<br /><br />Prescription drug wise I would personally recommend Escetalopram. It&#039;s an SSRI just like MDMA. I&#039;ve taken XTC for years and always found it useful for combating my anxiety. I therefore asked my doc to prescribe me a legal SSRI in the hope that it would have similar positive affects and it did.<br /><br />It has fewer side affects than the majority of anti-D&#039;s and is non addictive. However despite saying all that not every AD suits every single person. Same goes with all the other meds too. You have to get through the first month of taking it before you begin to feel better. During this time you may even feel slightly worse. <br /><br />It worked wonders for me but my gf took it and had to give up because she couldn&#039;t handle the first month. Also don&#039;t get EScetalopram confused with Cetalopram. They&#039;re both basically the same thing except the later is the older version and is only half as effective and with twice as many side affects. Some doctors will try and give you the older version to save money.<br /><br />Also bear in mind that AD&#039;s can often bring out suicidal thoughts in people. There had been lots of cases where the media, as part of their usual propaganda, have tried to blaming AD related deaths on cannabis if the victim was also smoking at the time.<br /><br />Once again no AD&#039;s are perfect but I found Escetalopram (brand name Cipralex in the UK) worked very well for me. <br /><br />Finally I also found some chemists in the UK dished out English Escetalopram whilst others used the Spanish version. Technically the same thing but for some reason I always found the English worked better on me.<br /><br />I also found taking it improved the high of being stoned!!
