				A couple of words of support for this australian vendor . This vendor is legit with some of the best meth available since shard minister . His communication&nbsp; , stealth , speed of delivery are all exceptional. If your chasing some hard hitting gear ..... look no further people .

				It is unfortunate you chose your first post to be one in support of a vendor. 99% of these kinds of first posts are simply the vendor posting it himself.<br /><br />Nothing against you personally, but if you are not the vendor, surely you realise this?

				Thank you for your review CARNAGE 1 for the .5g meth you bought last week.<br /><br />I know it may look like this review is my own doing nanpa2001 but i specifically asked for this customer to leave a review as he liked the meth he ordered from me greatly.<br />He told me after he posted this thread that he had been slack and never started a forum account.<br /><br />I have not and will not leave fake reviews about myself EVER.<br /><br />This is the original feedback this customer left me for his purchase of .5g meth<br />&quot;Your the man bro ... best quality i have had in the last ten orders. More importantly , your word is your word .... rare these days . Well done ... 5/5 for everything ...&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;(and in particular, a vendor about which there have been complaints in the past)&quot;<br /><br />I would appreciate it if you would not start rumors about me thanks, I have done nothing but been a great vendor since i started here and out of 103 transactions i have only got 1x 1/5 feedback which the reason&nbsp; is clearly explained at the bottom of my page.<br /><br />I will ask you to provide links to these &quot;complaints&quot; which you claim people have made against me??? <br /><br />If you cant back those claims up please edit your post and stop spreading rumors about good vendors.<br />Maybe you should order from me one day.<br />Thanks

				Nanpa think you got it wrong mate, have bought from Supplyin Aus before. He is a legit vendor and a gem to Aus SR Domestic. Went out of his way to post my package as I needed it for the weekend. Even free express post and overweight. <br /><br />

				Hi supply&nbsp; Nice reply! lol<br /><br />Yeah dude you sound like a genuine bloke trying to do the righty +1 for that bro ...Oh the POWERaaarrrrgghhhhhahhaaahahaha!<br /><br />motek respects that stuff big time ...TSR is a place where both buyers and vendors are &quot;takinga a chance&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;when atartimg with a new vendor OR buyer .... but imo&nbsp; it&#039;s so cool that we can develop online relationships based on a mutual trust and respect ... and in fact that none of us know or will know each other or will actually &#039;meet; IRL<br /><br />It&#039;s fuckin insanely cool IMO ;o)

				Just wanted to say that my experience with SupplyinAus was nothing but smooth and easy.&nbsp; I got a couple of things that aren&#039;t the most common on SR, and everything was great.&nbsp; Everything in the orders was exactly as described and the whole process was very smooth.<br />I haven&#039;t really made too many purchases on SR (just over 10) so as a noob I was cautious going with a vendor with less than 300 trans under their belt, but down here in Aus we can&#039;t really be too picky or choosy for some things.<br />I&#039;ve never left a review before, but like me as a purchaser, I had to start somewhere and get some stats under my belt, and so do vendors.&nbsp; I really want to see more Aussie vendors, and hopefully by giving positive reviews like this we may be able to keep some of the good ones around.<br />So if anyone was feeling the way I was about a &quot;sorta&quot; new vendor, be rest assured, SupplyinAus is genuine.
