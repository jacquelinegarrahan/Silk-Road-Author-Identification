				My advice is to start domestic, and small for your first order. One way to be sure the vendor is legit is to choose someone who has positive feedback from forum members with a large amount of posts who have been around a while, which is quite difficult to fake.

				That &#039;difficult first order&#039; eh? Go domestic, choose a vendor with good feedback and maybe introduce yourself, some don&#039;t like to supply to newbies without an order history of their own, it will give you a feel for how well they communicate too. Place a small order and don&#039;t FE!

				Pretty much what everyone else is saying what I was going to say.&nbsp; Order small, stay domestic, go with a trusted established vendor.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be okay kiddo ;)

				Some of us vendors don&#039;t bite...<br /><br />Choose a decent one - you can tell a mile off the fakes and just take a look around the forums when you can...you&#039;ll see how we interact and pick up on our business ethos...then when you feel a good vibe, contact one of us...have a chat...just like the real world you need to feel it&#039;s comfortable and you have someone you can call on.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />Doc

				I was ripped off with my first order by a very highly rated vendor yet I haven&#039;t been scammed since.&nbsp; Some vendors will selectively scam first time buyers as they know no one will believe the newbie.<br /><br />Start with only small orders and don&#039;t be wary of new vendors - if they&#039;ve only made a handful of sales they won&#039;t scam you for a $20 dollar order and risk losing their bond.

				as others have pointed out, a positive presence here in the forums is a good indicator of a honest seller. don&#039;t just buy from any old seller, do lots and lots of research or you will most definitely get ripped. i got jacked for 30 bucks my first purchase! :(

				my answer is not very objective since I am new seller. but new sellers do not take the risk of disservice to a client! and former seller often require FE to new customers. The advice I give: rest in escrow and buys with track and trace.<br /><br />as for example in my shop ;-)

				Pretty much all good advice so far. Small order, that you can afford to walk away from if need be. Domestic vendor (if possible, depending on your location), vendor with lots of transactions and good (95%+ feedback score), and vendor with some presence on the forums would all be good ideas.<br /><br />Good luck, you really don&#039;t need to be overly paranoid about a small order. Just use PGP to encrypt your address, don&#039;t FE unless totally necessary, don&#039;t check tracking through TOR, and enjoy.

				Hello all, grateful as heck for the site and&nbsp; hoping to be a good citizen in everyway.<br /><br />Do we need to encrypt with PGP to order, thanks for the help.
