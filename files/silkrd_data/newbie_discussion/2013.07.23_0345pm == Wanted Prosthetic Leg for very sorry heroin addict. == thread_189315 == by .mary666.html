				I posted my piece of mind about what mary666 and kalli were doing in the spare coins thread earlier. Sometimes people actually are short of .03 bitcoin or whatever, and truly are in need. Them two just fuck it up for those people needing real help. I&#039;ve also received -2 karma since i posted that over there. I&#039;ll bet it was them two cunts too.
