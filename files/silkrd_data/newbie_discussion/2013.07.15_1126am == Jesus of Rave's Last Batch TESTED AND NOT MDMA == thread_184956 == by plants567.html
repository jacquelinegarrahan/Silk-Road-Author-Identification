				After receiving two grams of Jesus of Rave&#039;s last MDMA batch (white/clear crystals, before he left the SR), I consumed about .1 grams + orally. Effects were not MDMA like. I had constant violent vomiting, pale trembling lips, and blacked out for a few hours, unable to control what I was saying, etc. After dosing, I was not only wired the entire night (far longer than my several experiences with MDMA have ever lasted) and the following days I had a rather persistent and severe back pain (still have).<br /><br />*** Upon buying a Marquis test kit, Jesus of Rave&#039;s MDMA was revealed to be either Meth or Amphetamines (turned a reddish pink hue that matched the color chart on the top of the kit). ***<br /><br /><br />IN SHORT: Jesus of Rave&#039;s last batch was certainly not MDMA (and apparently a messed up batch that resembled dirty meth/speed in the opinion of an experienced friend studying psychopharmacology) and provided me with a very unpleasant time. <br /><br /><br />(Context): I purchased a Bunk Police test kit at Camp Bisco in Mariaville, NY this weekend, and tested various substances passed off as MDMA. My friend&#039;s SuperTrips MDMA green question marks were absolutely pure (turned out black with the Marquis), and two other crappy MDMA capsules purchased at the festival by others came out yellow (as Methylone). I have taken MDMA close to 30 times in my life and certainly recognize what is and is not indicative of a pure roll.

				damn man, i purchased from JOR&#039;s last batch but yet to try properly! Thing is though why would you have those negative side effects if it was meth/speed?<br /><br />Maybe the &#039;MDMA&#039; is something else all together?

				Though I am obviously inexperienced with meth, some online research has indicated that back pain can sometimes be a side effect of use. Also negative effects seem to be exacerbated with dosages over 50 mg (according to my limited internet research) and I took over 100 mg so that would make sense. <br /><br />It&#039;s all good now though! Just wanted to let people know. Buying a test kit is so so worth it and it was wonderful to have my unease at the drug confirmed!

				Yeah i think i need to invest in a test kit, how much are they usually? and will it indicate exactly what the drug is out of a selection so to speak? or do they just indicate whether the drug is just one certain type of drug?<br /><br />Did the kit indicate how pure the meth was?<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions ( Lol) but i too have a gram of JOR&#039;s MDMA, so want t know exactly what it is.<br /><br />Peace.

				I got MDMA from JOR around may 31st.&nbsp; The stuff he had was perfect.&nbsp; It was super strong and tested perfect with my test kit.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have a test kit you can go by smell.&nbsp; Most MDMA has a distinct licorice scent.&nbsp; If regular MDMA user i would get the test kit from dancesafe.org.&nbsp; Their kits aren&#039;t single use, so it&#039;s a lot cheaper.

				ROFL, Snark....<br /><br />Smell is only effective if it&#039;s precursor is Saffrole anyhow...<br /><br />I&#039;d like to video tape someone trying sell MDMA smelling like fish at rave, not that you can smell anything over the VICKS.&nbsp; :)

				The Bunk Police also sell a test kit for $20 for MDMA and other associated substances. This batch I received was in Late June/Early July and was ordered a day or so before he left for good. The kit doesn&#039;t clearly indicate purity but it is supposedly indicated by the strength of the color. The kit has multiple colors indicating what the substance is (from methylone to opium to MDA, etc.). <br /><br />I figured it was important to say that his last batch was definitely not MDMA, as he is widely regarded as a great seller and provider of MDMA with stellar reviews. My friend seemed to think it was a messed up batch that wasn&#039;t really pure meth or MDMA. I again have done MDMA several times and this was definitely not MDMA. I still have back pains from it and it actually started my menstrual cycle prematurely, though I&#039;m not sure if this could be due to any drug use. Felt rather addictive also as I continued to do it following the bad experience and experienced what I believed to be a strange come down during which I slept for a very long time and felt cold? (Again not much meth/miscellaneous speed experience lol)<br /><br />Either way just be careful and test it! JOR is known to have super great stuff but this last batch was definitely bunk - be careful!
