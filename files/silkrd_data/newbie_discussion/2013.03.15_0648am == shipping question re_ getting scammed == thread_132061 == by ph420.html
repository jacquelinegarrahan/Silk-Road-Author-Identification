				hey guise <br /><br />i just have a general question as i am still new here (but just received my first successful shipment :D) ... <br /><br />so lets say that you hypothetically opt not to use a tracked shipping method and just through regular mail.. the vendor says that on regular mail shipments there is no refunds.. what&#039;s there to say that they just don&#039;t send the package at all and claim it is lost? is this common at all? (obviously i know more reputable vendors are the way to go but still.. what if they just choose this one time to make a quick buck and claim it was lost in the mail)? has anyone had this sort of thing happen before?

				if the vendor states they don&#039;t offer a refund in that situation, then there&#039;s really nothing anyone can do to prevent them from simply never sending the package out.&nbsp; that&#039;s why you stay in escrow, and also make use of the resolution center.

				Scammers seem to be fairly common on here. <br /><br />BUT if you use the escrow system and never finalize early there is no reason to worry =) :) =)

				I would never opt out of tracking. Just my opinion but tracking + priority domestic shipping = few if any lost packages. Just based on my experience. Less time packages are in the po hands the better.

				I have faith in some of the vendors. My first purchase and he asked me to FE since I had 0 purchase history. I&#039;m sure that a lot of these vendors have had bad experience with 0 purchase buyers and can understand why they would ask for an FE.&nbsp;

				I just hope all goes well. Got about $400 on the line and not many reports on this vendor (other than he has quality gear). Rating is great so I have faith and am just praying all goes well....<br /><br />If I can find this thread in the future, then I&#039;ll be back with some feedback
