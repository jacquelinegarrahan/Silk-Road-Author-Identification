				Hey guys, I&#039;m a chemist. Is there anything you can think of that you would love to buy from me?<br /><br />I can make things like:<br /><br />MDMA<br />Acid<br />DMT<br />Chloroform<br /><br />And much much more.<br /><br />I use advanced methods, to get high purities. I don&#039;t cut anything, so you can be sure to get the purest possible.<br /><br />Just trying to get ideas of what you may want :)

				Alright, I looked through my notebooks. I found a page in my notes, where I described in detail, my successful synthesis of 4-MAR! <br />Don&#039;t worry about me killing myself, I&#039;m not one of those lab idiots who only know it for the purpose of making drugs. People who make mistakes, like using a burner instead of a hot plate when flammables are in the air, tend to be the ones that die. Stupid rookie mistakes.<br /><br />BtcTrader: If I make some 4mec, you will need to buy it off the page I make for it. If your a dealer, looking for bulk, we can make a deal for a better price, after a few transactions. Of course, with escro.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only got the materials to make about 25 grams of DMT right now. Think that would sell fast here? I can get more materials within days.<br /><br />I realize that I need to pay up almost $500 worth of BTC to get my vendor account, and I&#039;m ready for it. Once my first batch is made, I will be launching my account, and throwing a page up.<br /><br />For such a price to start, I hope to build my reputation up fast! Right now, I&#039;m planning out my stealth packaging, and figuring out what would be the fastest shipping I can afford.<br /><br />For those who are new to this all. If I send you a package, I will NOT require a signature. If you are asked for one, it means they spotted the package. Send it back. Signing for a package, leads to instant arrest. <br /><br />My first product launch will be DMT! After that, I will start collecting what I need, in order to make other drugs. I will not be asking for FE.

				I would be very interested in chloroform, but at a reasonable price, the one listing I found on here was extortionate and was only a very small amount- pretty useless to use as a solvent- maybe they&#039;re marketing it as a date rape. lol NOT!!!<br />Anyway, it does seem pretty easy to synthesize so here&#039;s hoping!

				Hahaha, what price was he asking? :)<br /><br />When it comes to Chloroform, it comes down to three things for me.<br />1. Cost of supplies (chemicals and containers)<br />2.

				This thread has sparked some curiosity regarding synthesizing LSD and/or DMT.<br /><br />How long and how complicated of a procedure is it to successfully make either?<br />Is equipment very expensive?<br />What degree of knowledge is needed? (for example, is it something that you can have clearly laid out guidelines and learn how to make it without any knowledge of chemistry? or if you need previous skills in chemistry?)<br /><br />Basically, if I, someone with no knowledge in chemistry past the 9th grade, wanted to, hypothetically, make DMT, how difficult would it be to make? And LSD?<br /><br />I&#039;m just throwing questions I&#039;ve always wondered about these substances :). <br />Cheers if any/all are answered,

				From your comment, I take it your not advanced in chemistry, and most of all, organic chemistry. Considering this, please. Stay far far away from trying to make LSD. We don&#039;t need you killing yourself.<br /><br />On the other hand, DMT is not terribly hard to make, you just need to know where to get the precursor. The FEDs are cracking down on it lately though, so even I am watching my back. I know one guy who just got arrested for ordering some. I&#039;m only getting it easily and without suspicion, because I own a research and development company. Even then, its not guaranteed that they won&#039;t want to check out my lab. On the other hand, in this process, I&#039;ve walked into the room, and found my friend blacked out in the middle of making it. Damn fumes. He thought a white air filter mask would protect him. Those things filter particles out of the air, not gas. He could have at least used the fume hood.<br /><br />For those of you who missed this on the last page:<br />I&#039;m starting up with Free Shipping, discounted prices, and the first shipments will be getting extra!<br /><br />By the way, what order sizes would you guys prefer? In grams, please. I&#039;m using a 0.001g scale. This is for Quality DMT, strait from the lab, uncut!<br />Would you want:<br />0.250 g<br />0.500 g<br />1.000 g<br />1.500 g<br />2.000 g<br />more?

Any high school student with store bought chemicals and equipment can extract DMT.<br /><br />LSD on the other hand is so difficult to make that only about 1 in 20 people who claim/think they can make it actually can. Very skilled chemsists baulk at the procedure when they see it.<br /><br />Chemists who make DMT etc, they are common. Those who can actually make _pure_ LSD without any remaining precursors are about as rare as unicorns.<br /><br />No offense to the original poster, but have you ever actually made LSD? Do you know that it is very sensitive to light and temperature and requires controlled substances to create? Do you know how to do column chromatography? Do you have the right sort of lights? Do you have access to tartaric acid?<br /><br />You might find making LSD to be an expensive failure, most first attempts are. If done wrong you can leave deadly vasoconstrictors in it that can lead to extreme pain, loss of limbs and even death<br /><br />That precursor that is growing out of control is a deadly toxin that can fungally infect you. Doctors know what that type of fungal infection means too and they will report it.<br />

				@ Tessellated:<br />I have all that I need to make LSD, and I have done it before. In fact, I even have a thick set of lab notes on it. No worries :)<br />LSD was a bitch to figure out at first. Though, once you do it a few times, it becomes easier. And obviously, I know that it breaks down in light. I always store those things in dark containers, just like with the chloroform. Don&#039;t want them breaking down on me.<br /><br />The reason I told londonlondon to stay away from trying to make LSD, is actually because of that lovely toxin. I doubt he would know what he was handling. No offense londonlondon, just lookin out for ya.<br /><br />So no worries man, I know what I&#039;m doin :)<br />I used to sell the LSD I made, and nobody ever died from it ^_^<br /><br /><br />@ kingpioneer<br />Getting Heroine from Codeine can be dangerous. Mixing chloroform with hydroxide will generate carbenes, which are highly reactive. Not in the good way. Please, if your a noob, don&#039;t try it.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the other suggestions! I will take them into consideration :)<br />

				There&#039;s way more than enough LSD, MDMA, DMT, etc. on SR. As a chemist you should make substances that aren&#039;t readily available like :<br /><br />-secobarbital, pentobarbital and amobarbital<br />-ketobemidone<br />-dextromoramide<br />-oxymorphone, hydromorphinol, oxymorphazone, desomorphine, dihydromorphine (very easy) or other semisynthetic opioids<br />-glutethimide<br />-methaqualone<br />-ALD-52 instead of LSD<br />-MMDA and MDE instead of MDMA<br />-4-MAR<br />-Phenmetrazine<br />-Ethchlorvynol<br /><br />But synthetizing chloroform is pretty odd.

				Thats great! I&#039;m happy to know that I sparked an interest in chemistry for you :)<br />Now, if your interested in making drugs, focus on Organic Chemistry.

				Dude how you gonna lie to all these people and say you made LSD...<br />Your a teenager who is extremely bad when it comes to making up a lie.<br /><br />You say your gonna synth chloroform?<br />What the fuck for?<br />If you cant get chloroform, as if it were hard, how are you gonna get any of the L specific precursors?<br />Chloroform can be purchased and sent to a house. big fucking whoop, its also cheap as shit...<br /><br />Stupid people, do you think an LSD chemist is gonna get on the forums and tell you he will synth chloroform?<br />An active LSD chemist no way is gonna be talking about it anywhere, mostly because he would be busy in a tropical place getting his dick sucked instead of acting like a complete fool who knows nothing about the chemical game on a dark net forum.<br /><br />fucking dumbass

I&#039;m happy to know that I sparked an interest in chemistry for you :)<br />Now, if your interested in making drugs, focus on Organic Chemistry. I warn you, it gets into a lot of math, but I have always found the thrill of making anything in chemistry to make it worth all those years of hard work and daily studying. <br /><br />I know more than just Org Chem. I seriously do make a lot more than just drugs.<br /><br />My family thinks I&#039;m a bit nutty for having such a deep love of chemistry. Every day, I&#039;m studying. Oh! If your seriously interested in going into this, I recommend the book, The Organic Chem Lab Survival Guide. I go back and read it over again, just for fun sometimes. The author is humorous, yet gets the message through to ya ^_^<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206921.msg1489366#msg1489366">Quote from: tree on August 25, 2013, 08:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">There&#039;s way more than enough LSD, MDMA, DMT, etc. on SR. As a chemist you should make substances that aren&#039;t readily available like :<br /><br />-secobarbital, pentobarbital and amobarbital<br />-ketobemidone<br />-dextromoramide<br />-oxymorphone, hydromorphinol, oxymorphazone, desomorphine, dihydromorphine (very easy) or other semisynthetic opioids<br />-glutethimide<br />-methaqualone<br />-ALD-52 instead of LSD<br />-MMDA and MDE instead of MDMA<br />-4-MAR<br />-Phenmetrazine<br />-Ethchlorvynol<br /><br />But synthetizing chloroform is pretty odd. Why wouldn&#039;t you just buy that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Brilliant list man! I&#039;ll mark those down in my notebook. Thank you very much, I&#039;ve been waiting for someone to post a bigger list.<br />I only have one concern. Lets say, I make them, and post them up. Do many people know what those are here, to click on them?<br /><br />I have all the materials to make 4-MAR right now, except for the norephedrine-HCl. That stuff was easy to get my hands on a decade ago, but I&#039;m in the USA. I&#039;m lookin for a new source for it. If someone knows where I can get some, PM me please.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thanks for marking those down! :)<br /><br />Well I&#039;m pretty sure people know most of the drugs I listed. Glutethimide may be a bit obscure but you could always include &quot;Great opiate potentiator&quot; in the title to intrigue people and then they&#039;d read the description and know that&#039;s it good. <br />Barbiturates, methaqualone and semisynthetic opioids are pretty well known so that wouldn&#039;t be a problem. There&#039;s demand for ALD-52, MMDA and MDE on here so that would sell well too. <br />Semisynthetic opioids would fly off the shelves guaranteed though ;)<br /><br />You may have some trouble selling more really old-school stuff like glutethimide, ethchlorvynol and phenmetrazine but I&#039;ve seen threads of people asking for these so it&#039;s not completely unknown either.<br />Ketobemidone and palfium are popular opioids so I think enough people know about them for you to sell too.<br />Another one that has a lot of demand that I forgot to list is PCP, I&#039;d rather have barbs honestly but it&#039;d be nice to have that.<br /><br />If you&#039;re selling drugs that no-one else has you&#039;ll have more customers than &quot;just another MDMA vendor&quot; IMO, there wouldn&#039;t be any competition.<br /><br />It would be nice to bring back the oldies but goodies!<br /><br /><br />About the chloroform, you could just sell your chloroform you buy from chemical suppliers is what I meant. Synthetizing it sounds like too much trouble when you can just buy it for cheap and at a determined level of purity.<br /><br />And what other things do you make than just drugs? :P

				@ Lie<br />If you don&#039;t like me, you don&#039;t have to post here. I love what I do, which is why I talk about it. I would rather make something myself rather than go out and buy it, just for the fun of it. <br /><br />Now, think about this. If a chemist comes on here wanting to open up shop, and says that they know how to make it, why bother making such a rude comment? Why not wait, and watch to see if they end up posting said product for sale? Time proves things. Complaining doesn&#039;t.<br /><br /><br />@ tree<br />Thanks! I&#039;ve spent a lot of time&nbsp; in the past, hangin with big dealers, but I (believe it or not), almost never see those other drugs. On the other hand, its great to know that people here know about them!<br /><br />Its true, I could go get it from a chem supplier. In fact, I could get away with it easily, due to my company. I will probably end up doing that, though it would take the fun out of that part for me. On the other hand, it may be more time effective. I&#039;m still a bit cautious of what I&#039;m seen buying, as I don&#039;t want to look suspicious as well.
