				I just don&#039;t get it: everything adapts to this stupid Bitcoins only the prices not! So I can lose Bitcoins by only cancelling ok, but I should still be able to by the same stuff with my money! Or am I mislead?

Gox. <br /><br />So sometimes you&#039;ll get more, sometimes you&#039;ll get less BTC. It&#039;s always the same USD back.

				It is one way only: only dealers can hedge! I payed 1.25, several hrs later the price is going down (by dealers own because of Bitcoin&nbsp; fluctuation) being now 1Bitcoin! It&#039;s just good or bad luck! The dealer is cashing more Bitcoins, but once again the buyer is left alone. <br />Everything is done to protect the dealer, but what about the buyers? I know it can be the other way round, but fuck that! Nobody can do business like that!<br />

These are DRUG DEALS!<br /><br />If you would rather take your chances on the street with some snotty nosed punk who has been dealing 2 minutes who will rip off as soon as kill you, be our guest.<br /><br />If you want to stick around and enjoy the Silk Road experience I suggest you chill out. Learn how to type a coherent sentence and learn to take the rough with the smooth.<br /><br />It&#039;s a gambling game. You are buying illegal drugs in the safest way I know, using a very new currency that has good days and bad days. <br /><br />My first day I made $100, I expect I will lose Â£100 just as easily.<br /><br /><br />The secret to not losing out too much is to buy your bitcoins and then spend them all asap. That way you minimize the risk of them dropping in value while they sit in your SR wallet.<br /><br />Or you leave them there and wait for the value of Bitcoins to go through the roof and cash in.<br /><br />Choose reputable vendors. Never FE. Chill the fuck out.<br /><br /><br />
