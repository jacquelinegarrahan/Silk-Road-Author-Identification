				Nobel Prize Winner in Medicine Dr. Otto Warburg discovered the prime cause of cancer in 1920. It has to do with lack of oxygen to the cells. For Beyond 50&#039;s &quot;Natural Healing&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Professor Brian Peskin. He has advanced the seminal research of Dr. Warburg through his own meticulous medical research, fully explained in his book, &quot;The Hidden Story of Cancer.&quot; You will discover HOW TO STOP cancer&#039;s prime cause cold in its tracks. Cancer no longer has to be in yours or your loved one&#039;s futures.<br /><br />VIDEO: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei2wUzrXRyU

				This Ph-chart is everything you need to cure cancer, combined with Warburgs science:<br /><br />http://jughandlesfatfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/food_ph_chart-600x643.jpg<br /><br />The high ph vegetables and fruits cure cancer and the lowph creates cancer.<br /><br /><br />Im sorry folks but cannabis is not the cure for cancer, it helps to cure it, just look at the worry, lack of sleep and overwork, cannabis helps with those and rises the ph of the blood and gets rid of cancer, not as fast as the high alkaline fruits and veggies tho.<br /><br />

That would really make it popular to join in and spend a small sum of money to get a bunch of letters to other peoples homes, just for the love of humanity, and a little for the hate of the evil bastard getting payed to look for the cure that was found 84 years ago, I promise you they will never find the cure that was found 84 years ago, since they are makin to much money from searchin for the cure they have already found.<br /><br />Any vendors here and willing to be a part of something like this?<br /><br />If Silkroad was used for sharing info thru letters, the people would have the power since the media would shut down if the people knew all the shit they be lyin about.<br /><br />think about it.<br /><br />Much love!

				1 in 3 will get cancer they say, just so you will pay more to them so they can look for this cure some more..<br /><br />The radiation is rising in the solarsystem and so is the rate of cancer..<br /><br />So take your time and think about this but please lets do this, vendors unite!!<br /><br />One vendor from each country would be perfect..<br /><br />Some people have to have had some relatives that had cancer, I got a relative who had cancer but survived to be able to create the cancer again since they dont know what causes and cures the cancer and the cellpoison they give people to cure cancer, kills most people since its not so good at pickin the right cells to kill.<br /><br />

If the blood pH is too alkaline you&#039;re gonna have issues though so I don&#039;t know if mosquitoes don&#039;t bite if your blood is alkaline. <br />I think it&#039;s the pH of the liquid in your cells or something else but definitely not the blood. Try eating a lot of baking soda at once and you&#039;ll see how it feels to have an alkaline blood, it changes your breathing rhythm and you feel a little weird, you can also die if your blood pH is too far above 7.45.. You can only have variations of about 0.20 in your blood pH. Even people eating very unhealthily have a normal blood pH. <br /><br />Even on your chart it says that the optimal blood pH is 7.365 and not 7.45 (which is as alkaline as possible without having ill effects), so I think it makes other things alkaline, maybe your urine but not your blood.<br /><br />Either way that&#039;s still an interesting theory, but raw spinach and broccoli don&#039;t seem so tasty.

If we dont destroy ourself by eating deadfoods that got a lowPh.<br /><br />The groundbreakin thing is that we need the life / electricity in the food to be able to stay alove and if you eat dead foods you are killing yourself slowly because you are what you eat. And what do you see on the tv / propagandabox? cookinshow after cookinshow mixed with some commercials. Never any rawfood-shows why is that? hehe<br /><br />i can tell you all about the alkalinesandwitch I eat daily and that it made me immune to tic and mosquitobites because my blood has to high PH for them to be able to bite me, if they would bite me I think they would kill themselves by filling themselves up with oxygenrich blood. Maybe they would explode or implode if they tried it but they dont.<br /><br />The sandwitches I eat daily taste like pizza since I use some pizzaspices..<br /><br />I just use a mixer.. And I mix raw onion, raw cucumber, raw tomato, raw carrot, raw spinish, raw leek and some pizzaspices.. Then I spread it on some thin dark clean bread.<br /><br />Try to tell that to someone suffering with obesity and diseases, like hey you can cure everything by eating the pizzatasting alkaline rawfood sandwitch that someone on the internet recommended.

If the blood pH is too alkaline you&#039;re gonna have issues though so I don&#039;t know if mosquitoes don&#039;t bite if your blood is alkaline. <br />I think it&#039;s the pH of the liquid in your cells or something else but definitely not the blood. Try eating a lot of baking soda at once and you&#039;ll see how it feels to have an alkaline blood, it changes your breathing rhythm and you feel a little weird, you can also die if your blood pH is too far above 7.45.. You can only have variations of about 0.20 in your blood pH. Even people eating very unhealthily have a normal blood pH. <br /><br />Even on your chart it says that the optimal blood pH is 7.365 and not 7.45 (which is as alkaline as possible without having ill effects), so I think it makes other things alkaline, maybe your urine but not your blood.<br /><br />Either way that&#039;s still an interesting theory, but raw spinach and broccoli don&#039;t seem so tasty.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Like I said, the alkalinity is electricity / life / sunpower, in the fruits and veggies. So I doubt the whole thing about bakinsoda. Placing a glass of water in sunshine will raise the Ph of the water, kinda fast to since I have tried it myself. It will also clean the water they say but I cant test that myself but the Ph was easy to test.<br /><br />You make it tasty by mixing raw stuff together, take some spinash and broccoli and mix them with the 3 base ingridient tomato, cucumber and carrot. Them 3 baseingridients makes a nice consistency thats easy to spread on some bread. Put some taste into it by adding spices and youre body will be energiezed like you have never felt before.<br /><br />

				There are several anti-cancer compounds currently going through lab-testing. Certain examples would be SMIP004, BI811283, rita, &amp; mita.<br /><br />There is also A LOT of experimental research and treatments going on, such as ultrasound energy, exosomes, gene therapy, an anti-cancer vaccine where the cells are extracted, exposed to UV rays for 24 hours, and reinjected, photodynamic therapy, reoviridae, provenge, oncophage, intestinal stem cells, bacterial treatments, human alpha-lectalbumin made lethal to tumor cells, quercetin, oncolytic virus, the list goes on. Within the next 10 years expect a cure, even if none of these methods were to play out, gene therapy, biotech, and molecular nanotech WILL cure it completely and eventually cure death.<br /><br />You guys as a collective do not understand clinical trials or research studies, the FDA and big pharma do not simply IGNORE methods, rather they can be slowed to a crawl, but not ignored or hidden.. There have been SEVERAL STUDIES regarding Otto Warburg&#039;s methods and theories. The body has a strict pH control system to begin with and there is an extensive buffer system to counter any change in pH, food will not change and cannot change the pH of blood, not by a significant amount anyway.<br /><br />http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/herbsvitaminsandminerals/cesium-chloride<br /><br />http://www.mesotheliomasymptoms.com/food/cesium-chloride<br /><br />http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/cesium-chloride<br /><br />Please stop using pseudoscience and youtube as a basis.

				I don&#039;t work for anyone, actually.. And I&#039;ve provided you proof and there has been over 80 years worth of clinical studies. The body simply does not work like that, I&#039;m not a cancer expert but I know my basic biology. We know that our body maintains homeostasis and keeps the pH in our circulatory system (and most tissues) pretty consistent. Deviation from those pH will end in serious consequences, and our body pH is not dependent on our food intake. Now to pH and cancer. If you read the what Warburg actually stated in his hypothesis, you will see that he postulated cancer cells tend to conduct higher level of glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation, instead of aerobic respiration compared to healthy cells (a phenomenon known as Warburg effect). The acid (lactic acid) production is the result of the cancer/tumour, not the cause. Instead, impaired mitochondrial function (which is critical for aerobic respiration) and adaptation to low-oxygen environment have been implicated in causing the Warburg effect in recent research.<br />TL;DR: You can&#039;t control your body pH with food. Even if you can, changing your systemic body pH will kill you before you can kill the cancer. Localised acidity is the symptom not the cause.<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_hypothesis<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_effect<br /><br />The low localised oxygen is also a symptom of poor vascular system for the tumour, and oxygen-rich diet doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br /><br />It is claimed by the proponents of cesium supplements that, because the element can penetrate almost all cells, cesium chloride is able to alter the pH balance of cancer cells. Supposedly, cancer cells have a low pH and, by taking cesium supplements, the pH is raised, which slows the rate of the tumor&#039;s growth. However, there is not any evidence that cancer cells have a lower pH level than normal cells. Then, there is no evidence that cesium chloride increases the pH level of cancer or regular cells. Finally, there is still no evidence that, even if it did raise the pH levels of cells, this would slow the growth of cancer. In short, there is no evidence for the premises, the proposed mode of action and the various effects that the proponents of cesium chloride claim.<br /><br />The only evidence that currently exists is that some cancer cells in some mice did grow slightly more slowly. This, however, has not been replicated in human cancer trials. Furthermore, the mode of operation is unknown. So, there are a great many unknowns surrounding the proposed benefits of cesium chloride supplementation. Many more studies would need to be performed to even come close to scratching the surface of what proponents claim to be scientific facts.<br /><br />Furthermore, there have been certain negative side effects associated with cesium chloride supplementation. For instance, some cancer patients who supplemented with cesium chloride ended up exhibiting worrying side effects. Seizures, drifting in and out of consciousness and other life threatening effects are correlated with the ingestion of cesium chloride.<br /><br />In conclusion, while the positive effects of cesium chloride remain scientifically unknown and speculative, the negative effects have been demonstrated in several clinical and human trials. While many complementary and alternative treatments for those suffering from cancer do exist, cesium chloride supplementation continues to, despite the audacious and hopeful claims of cesium proponents, offer more risks than benefits.<br /><br />Simply put, correlation DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION! Please, stop getting caught up in pseudoscience or &#039;magic thinking&#039; where a seemingly convincing law or principal gets misapplied.. <br /><br />Go ahead and read these this time<br />http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/herbsvitaminsandminerals/cesium-chloride<br />http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/cesium-chloride

				yeah okey thats overstandable, you a sheeple on the way to the slaughter..<br /><br />Ofcourse animals are treated well behind closed doors when they kill them and treat them as objects so you can poison your own body and create cancer. And you inherit the feeling the animals had before death by digesting that meat. So feel free to ignore his animals cruelty and continue creating karma on yourself. You know there is no higher powers in this world right? the governments are the highest power inthis world right? hahahahaa dummy.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what RCs are. The pigs organs and skin can be used on humans in operations because its human DNA in it and we are evolving and cannibal zombies will be a fact since evolution does not happen with small changes over long periods of time, the fossile records show drastic big fast changes in designs. All the sudden we have a new fully designed animal and never ever did we see any small changes, you believe that tho since the slaveowners told you it happened and they would never lie to a slave in training / child in school. Dummy, deprogram what they taught you if you care about yourself.<br /><br />If you dont care if you eat frankenstein the let me tell you that you are what you eat and many people will not make it.. most people will not make around 85% is going to burn since they dont care about themslvs, others or their homeplanet.<br /><br />The radiation is rising in the solarsystem and so is the cancer, Im just telling you what makes cancer able to grow so you can make your own decition if you want to create or cure cancer since it will go easier and easier to get cancer now when the radiation and heat is rising since the sun is changin form from carbonbased to chrystalbased.<br /><br />You did not learn shit you dummy, they tricked you to eat animals and create karma since you aint at the top of the foodchain you see, and theywant to eat you so they are just giving you the choice to make yourself fat and juice so you taste sweet when they come to feed on the sheeple who think aliens does not exist, slavery is over and slaveprivileges 8salary) is what life is all about, and ignoring the destruction of the homeplanet since people are dumbed down enough they dont innerstand that when the planet die most of humanity will die with it.<br /><br />the planet will cleans herself from the parasites and it will burn you Im just telling you so you can make your own choices.<br /><br />I aint here to discuss how dumbed down you are, you had the internet avalible for 20+ years now, so why did you not use it to find some things out by yourself? <br /><br />Its really easy to google it and finding out if humans are omnivores or if we are herbavores and thats what I did when I found out schools and mainstream science are bullshitting you so you can give yourself cancer by believing you a scavanger when youre really designed to eat living fruit and veggies.<br /><br />You to dumb to even know how to type in words into google and pressing enter to find out what ever. Believe it or not there are some secrets the schools dont teach the slaves in today society.<br /><br />im ashamed of you for hat youre doing to yourself but I cant make you think.

				In Sweden where I live it is 9 million inhabitants and probably around maximum 5 million homeadresses.<br /><br />Now listen I will calculate this so you can see how this would work in reality.<br /><br />5 million letters will cost around 30 million swedish kronors and 1 dollar is around 6 kronors.<br /><br />If 30 people payed 1 million each to get the letters sent then all homes in Sweden would know the cure for cancer and all disease.<br /><br />If 5000 people payed 6000 kronors each ($1000) all homes would get a letter.<br /><br />If 20 000 people payed 1500 kronors each then all homes would get the letter.<br /><br />If 50 000 people payed 600 kronor ($100) each then 5 million homes would get the cure for cancer in a letter.<br /><br />And so on.. <br /><br />You think it would be hard to find 50 000 people among 9 million of them that wants to pay $100 to share the cure for cancer with a entire country?<br /><br />Remember that they do say 1 in 3 will get cancer since they want more money to &quot;look&quot; for this cure.

				If only 1% of the population in a country would pay to get 100% of the population informed about what ever, cancer is a great place to start.. Then that would be easy since 100 letters is not much to pay for.<br /><br />Do you trust 1% of the population is the question or are they also dumbass sheeple who think the slaveowners of society will become concious and get empathy soon and we should not do anything to try to save people?<br /><br />In my slavearea called Sweden that would be 45000 people that have to pay for 100 letters each, and in Sweden we have around 1 million people that has broken the laws against drugs.<br /><br />In other words this is fully possible but I cant do it myself tho unless SR hooks me up with a vendoraccount then I would do this myself, I would print 5 million letters myself but I dont have money or a vendoraccount.. And i would not even want to make a profit from it so the price would be per letter an the money would go straight to papers and colors for the printer, and stamps.<br /><br />I aint go much money but I would pay the small money I got to get letters sent out there if a vendor or vendors could just work together for mankind.<br /><br />The future is probably already written tho and this will probably not work, not because of me or the people who wants to pay for this service, but the vendors dont really care is what I believe since none has said anything yet.<br /><br />I thought a bunch of vendors would want to join in to give people this service and make a bit of money while clearing karma.. =(<br /><br />

				@RogerPantade<br />what have you heard about use of apricot kernels to cure cancer? there are plenty of successful stories.<br /><br />Precess:&nbsp; Cancer loves sugar.&nbsp; The sugar in the apricot seeds surrounds cyanide.&nbsp; The cancer draws in the sugar, eats it, and releases the cyanide at the cancer cell and only at the cancer cell: sort of like a smart bomb.

				Yeah all them vegetables , cannabis, hemp and seeds and everythinng HELPS to cure cancer but they aint the cure since the cure is knowing the cause and then you realise that they all are cures if you know the cause but you could never ignore the cause and think that something dead can cure cancer since you need the life of the cannabis or vegetables or seeds.. they need to be raw or else they have lost their lifeforce and lowered the ph-level of it.<br /><br />growers know the importance of the ph-level of the plants so they know the truth when i say humans are walkin trees not talkin monkeys..

				Hahahahahaaa karma is a universal law, it can take some time to pay back for what you do to others in this dimension but it will be payed back one way or the other if you dont fix it and pays it back yourself by doing good to others, helping others..<br /><br />So when SR goes dont you should remember this thread heheheee since we was all able to do good to others if just the vendors was able to provide a service like this.<br /><br />everything youre attached to will have to be destroyed for you to realise that this is a hologram thats not real , its a dream and spirituality is what really matters not some damn objects or money.. And yeah karma is a universal law so I dont have to judge anyone for not doing this. you will be judged by yourself and not many people love themselves. I mean look at this thread for example.. And my bad karmavotes hahahaa.<br /><br />Get your head out of this material realm and you might see the truth.<br /><br />Cancer does make a small raise the Ph-level of the blood and low-ph blood is what causes cancer. Eating dead food.<br /><br />But you can never continue eating bad foods if you get cancer if you just smoke cannabis since you will still die from cancer then since you did not eliminate the cause of cancer, the dead foods you ate.<br /><br />You are what you eat thats the secret, eat dead foods and youre killing yourself slowly.<br /><br />But now it will go really fast tho people will burn their skin off so its no cancer this time , its full on solarstorms and peoples skin will burn off if they ate poison dead foods.. =(<br /><br />Im not joking either.

				It would appear that we&#039;ve met before, in another spectral plane in the outer reaches of the cosmos, wait...... no....it wasn&#039;t... got it, it was in the &quot;AYAHUASCA!!!...What to expect the first time...&quot; thread. You&#039;re the guy that can stimulate his prostrate gland, sorry, pineal gland, that was it. Got to say though, judging from your lack of grammar and punctuation, it sort of figures that you buy into these fringe belief systems, it shows a lack of a solid scientific base, upon which to judge such things. Even through my brief examination of the subject (very interesting), I understand that the guy was quite a genius, he identified&nbsp; a causal effect of the cancer cell, for which he received a Nobel Prize, the rest, was not solid scientific fact (tested and retested to find the truth of the matter), it was merely supposition, that you have seized on because it supports what you want to believe, as for the Pineal Gland, being the source of DMT, this is again, a matter of supposition, on the part of Dr. Rick Strassman, based on the fact that the the pre-cursor materials capable of becoming DMT, exist there. I got rather interested in this, read a lot on forums about it, to find that people had seized upon this supposition (highly controversial) and were espousing it as being a proven fact, because they wanted to believe it.<br />I really don&#039;t expect you to take this onboard, I&#039;m sure you will meet my post with another rabid rant of the &quot;Party Line&quot;, with no willingness to discuss, dissect, or otherwise any points of your belief. You are a fanatic, plain and simple. Just like the politicians you hate! Not willing to even argue about the points you have made, just like the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;, no compromise, stick to the &quot;Party Line&quot;. Remain blinkered.

I find the whole scenario fascinating, I was just a bit put off with so many people talking as though what Strassman hypothesized, was in fact, true, proven fact. It all seemed a bit confusing in parts, to do with the fact that the precursors for DMT are present in many things, plants and animals. Many people seem to mix that fact up, and come out with the statement that these plants and animals actually make their own DMT, this new research seems to support the idea that actual production of DMT goes on. <br /><br />It&#039;s certainly starting to come together, with the new research, I believe one problem in finding it in humans, is the difficulty in measuring it, due to the speed at which DMT is broken down in the body. If you are using rats to research this, I suppose it could be easier because you don&#039;t have to worry about harming the animal, unlike human research.<br /><br />I was really using the whole DMT thing as an example of how people tend to not read things accurately, and seize elements of it, because they like the idea of it. Then these things get passed around on &quot;social media&quot; sites, then the real truth of the matter is lost!<br />This guy just seems incapable of discussing his belief in a coherent manner, I have never heard of the alkaline/acid thing about foods, I downloaded the jpeg showing the different values of foods and would be interested in finding out more about it, but you can&#039;t really do this with a zealot. I don&#039;t believe the curing cancer part, but elements of it seem to have some scientific basis. <br /><br />It reminds me a bit of Hinduism and their Ayurvedic system of dividing foods into different catergories, inherent in all substances, arranged in ten pairs of antonyms: heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, viscous/liquid. They also divide people into different categories, and eat according to this information.<br /><br />Interesting subject, but no hope of learning anything useful about it from the OP.<br /><br />I liked your point about Obama and his Nobel Peace?????? Prize, bit like giving Bush junior it for contributions toward World harmony! lol.<br />

Eating dead animals is GREAT. I challenge anyone to try and get a decent amount of muscle to stay on your body if you cut out meat. Your only other option is to pack down nut protein in large amounts which will add significant amounts of fat into your nutritional macro numbers. With lean meats like turkey and chicken available in free-range and true organic poultry farming, you can now eat some of the best proteins money can buy.<br /><br /><br />I loved the idea of helping out until I read what dribble was posted about nutrition..... You know jack shit about REAL nutrition based on the series of posts that the thread starter left. I&#039;m all for spreading the word and helping people, but you are batshit.

I was honestly going to only leave the one comment about nutrition but you are full of horse shit and i will start explaining why. You simply cannot say eating meat makes you tired...... What makes me and others tired after eating meat is when we GO WORKOUT!!!!&nbsp; I know of many species that live long happy and healthy lives on both purely carnivorous and omnivorous diets. Your argument of herbivores is a strawman argument to try and confuse people that have no clue about how normal animals besides us work. Of course a herbivore can&#039;t process meats..... Their physiology is not set up for that. We evolved and have teeth set up for omnivore eating. We also have enzymes and organs that over time were made to process both meat and veg though years and years of evolution. I understand your fear of what we feed our food supply but that is why I suggest free range and truely 100% organic poultry farming. There is a reason why it costs 2-3 times the price of regular meat..... BECAUSE IT IS A CLEAN FOOD SOURCE!!!!!! Please just stop posting. Your arguements are uninformed at best, and your advice is honestly counterproductive to human physiology. We REQUIRE meat sources to gain trace minerals we need like iron. Present day we can get these trace minerals from supplements or multivitamins, but this is a recent invention. We were getting the trace minerals we needed for thousands of years with both meat and through water from aquifers. So sorry to inform you that you are full of shit sir................... But you are!

Now go kill yourself since you are what you eat, eat dead foods.<br /><br />Peace folks its nice to hear you all know better then nobelprizewinners when it comes to science bbt you should read about the design of the human body since its not a carnivore or scavanger design since none of them have to cook their meats to be able to eat them since they got bacterias in their stomach that enables them to process dead meats. Humans dont we need to cook it or die fast from eating raw meats.<br /><br />Much love

				I heard hemp oil is a cure for cancer as well. There&#039;s supposedly a clinic in LA where some guy has cured thousands of people. Not sure of its credibility and haven&#039;t researched the topic myself but it&#039;s interesting nonetheless. There&#039;s a documentary on YouTube on this. Just search for &quot;hemp oil cancer cure&quot; or something. Have fun!

				We have a protectionshield of energy (northen lights gives the evidence) around the Earth thats getting lifted so you wont get cancer if you eat dead foods, your skin will burn off.. Thats the apocalypse we are facing. The sunstorms cant hit us when the protection is here but when its lifted its gonna get hot and humanity will split into 2 frequencies so you crazypeople will be eating eachothers since you have no idea that nature and your third eye is all you need to survive. You still think you need money and dead foods so you will be killing humans to eat them since they will probably be laying bbq humans in the streets..<br /><br />You had 2 choices stay in this dimension and burn or detach from everything destroying mother Earth and she will take her with her to paradise on the new Earth in the 5th dimension.&nbsp; Most people could not detach, they continued to eat animals and drink babies in Pepsi since they thought they knew what is was since they still trust the slaveowners who say its fair if we gets to vote between 2 of them once every forth year hahahaa.<br /><br />I got a magnetic field around me already and it can move particles so im protected when the shield is lifted, but I have be eating right for a long time and I have stayed off flouride for 10 years since I heard it was a poison. Alot of humansdont care enough about themselves to start caring about animals and others in theese last days and they will burn for that. =(<br /><br />Its all good tho they will just stay in this dimension until they get it and gets some balls so they can have a look at reality and start playing the game of life, since they are getting played out by theiir opponents easy. They still delive in democracy and money hahahaa they clown basicly.<br /><br />Take care folks

				The aliens did create the original man in their labs but she was clever like the aliens but also spiritual and the aliens were not spiritual. Tho original GMOhuman left Atlantis and lived with nature instead of being slaves to aliens without spirituality. So the alien created 2 more dumbed down versions of humans that would be accepting to be slaves to them aliens they see as gods.<br /><br />And here we are and nothing has changed tousands of years later, the slaves are still slaves but they are dumber then ever and they protect master with their ignorance and stupidity to the fact that they are slaves.<br /><br />I found the cause and cure for cancer online i said and they found it 84 years ago.. Noway said the slaves. Master would never do that to us. we love master.<br /><br />Someone is spraying the sky using airplanes I said 10 years ago until today.. Noway said the slaves. Master would never do that to us. master love us.<br /><br />Obama have a stonemonument called Georgia Guidestones saying that 90% of humanity will get murdered, in his backyard. Noway said the slaves, master would never do that. master look like humans like us and we just dumbed down slaves we let them kill us since we are so afraid to get killed if we talked about slavery and that we dislike master. So we love master.<br /><br />We aint got time for you dumbed down slaves, the ones who did this to you is gonna pay now and its sad that youre gonna stay with master and burn up because what master did to you. Its really sad. But i cant make slaves think since they aint made to think they are made to be slaves and dumbed down.<br /><br />The examples of theese slaves can be seen writing in this thread about their disbelif in evidence since master would never do that. hahahahahaa<br /><br />Good luck slaves

				I do love you slaves tho and thats why I call you slaves..<br /><br />You slaves on the other hand are to afraid to talk about the slavery that is the slaveconomy, and you dont really care about the other slaves in the matrix since you get slaveprivileges.<br /><br />Like I said I cant make you think. They basicly removed the spiritual from you and told you that youre talkin monkeys and that you should go against the nature you came from. And thats sad since the good will win so its sad when&nbsp; you dont wanna be good to others, daughter Earth and mother Nature.<br /><br />And ofcourse they also taught you that the ones who got dark skin is less valued since they are to the slavemasters since they are the originals and the whiteskinned people are the bastard childs of the aliens, the dumbed down versions that was created after the negros left Atlantis and lived on Lemuria instead. They still use it against humanity.<br /><br />Alot of white people will not listen to darkskinned people or things that talk against master, its programmed into your DNAs that you should say that I am crazy if I find evidence about your masters soul-less acts.<br /><br />Maybe if you read what I write you unlocks your DNa to become more original and cae for nature and yourself instead of master.<br /><br />i dont know. What you think?
