				Sent btcs to my address on SR around 7hours ago. Its was a pretty good amount of bitcoins...<br /><br />Upon reviewing the blockchain, I had about 14 confirmations, then it was sent to another address. If I could have a SR support pm me, or at least respond to my message on the road, that would be terrific. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what going on, but I think the problem is with this tumbler..<br /><br />I need to talk to staff, or tech support, but can only post in newbie forum.<br /><br />Been at SR for a long time now, just don&#039;t really ever have a need to use the forums, but with my problem my only option was to post in forums.

				did you notice anything weird in the block-chain? <br /><br />In my block, it shows me getting the btcs to my sr address. Then it goes off to other addresses, I suspect the tumbler..But I am not sure, and I don&#039;t want to be out of 52btcs.<br /><br /><br />And thank you for an actual helpful reply.

				In my experience, your BTC will make their way back around to you and show up in your account. It can take awhile, just requires some patience sometimes. I almost lost my head last week when I was in the same predicament. I decided to sleep it off and when I logged in in the morning, there they were. If there is a problem, SR support will get back to you and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll take care of you. :)

				Ya, I have just never&nbsp; had this problem before. Been here since a month after launch, so it is a little awkward when something doesn&#039;t go as expect.<br /><br />I will take your advice and try to sleep it out. Hope my cart items don&#039;t get sold out before they show ;D<br /><br />Thanks for the reply, really helpful, it at least makes me feel a little more at ease!<br /><br />

				This is the 3rd &quot;where are my BTC?&quot; thread I have seen in the last two hours. I also haven&#039;t had my account credited when I have 29 confirms typically I get credited 15 minutes after the 7th like clockwork. Normally I would just chalk it up to &quot;well sometimes these things take time&quot; but I also saw one where a user to user transfer failed tonight so I think there&#039;s something wrong on SR at the moment. This is a good thing in my opinion because that means staff can fix the problem and hopefully everyone&#039;s BTC show up shortly after rather than having to wait while they wade through the hundreds of contacts they undoubtedly get ever day to get to yours and then investigate and so on. <br /><br />As for not receiving a response, chill it might take them a minute or two to get back to you and by minute or two I mean give it 24 hours at the very least before you start bugging this isn&#039;t your local telecom&#039;s live 24/7 support team. Search for &quot;confirmations&quot; and you&#039;ll see dozens of threads where people were freaking out, contacted support and the next day or two post &quot;Thanks DPR credited my account!&quot; there are almost as many of those as &quot;Oh here they are I guess it was just taking unusually long&quot;

				By the way, it&#039;s been recommended in other threads that you get a new SR address periodically, once a month or so. This seems to prevent transfer/tumbling problems for older users.

				Glad this was already resolved positively. Just popping in to say that I&#039;ve had coins take over 10 hours to load to my SR account too. Even though I make it a habit to change my address semi frequently.
