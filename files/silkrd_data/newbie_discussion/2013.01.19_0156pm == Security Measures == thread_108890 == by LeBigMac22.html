				Hello. <br />I was wondering how much effort people have put into there security before making an order.<br />Ive read everything from members that have made multiple orders without using GPG, to others that wont buy bitcoins on there own computer.<br />for me, I will definitely use GPG but probably use my own computer to acquire BTC&#039;s, not using TOR for that as I cant find a place that accepts anonymous proxy. (please let me know if there is a place, UK)<br />The USB way seems very secure but looks like something I would get stuck on.<br /><br />How safe is this, has anybody else applied this level of security?<br /><br />I only want to buy small amounts of stuff for personal use, there are 2 things in particular that I want to experience, then ill probably leave it for a long time after that. <br /><br />Your thoughts please...<br /><br />

				If you go with established reputable vendors in your country, use PGP for sensitive data (your real name and address) and don&#039;t talk about it outside here, you&#039;ll probably be fine.

				When taking every security measure into account, there are vendors that save all of your communication. God knows if they even do that securely or not. <br />Please read this:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108854.0

				If you have a trojan or security software that secretly sends private information then nothing you do is very useful.<br />

Anything on your computer itself should be kept in an encrypted vault e.g. trucrypt making sure you set up both the inner and outer volumes so if &#039;pressed&#039; you can give up the password to the outer volume where the non incriminating information is saved.

				Thanks very much, i will look into Trucrypt.<br />I dont want to rush into anything, as much as i want to get my hands on certain substances, this is just another step in the process. <br />Getting closer :)<br />I want to remain an active member on the forums for now, although i cant help much at the moment.<br />This really does feel like the future is landing, and its exciting to be a part of.<br />

If you are worried about having your forum activity linked to your buyer history though then use different user names for added security however if it&#039;s come to that then you have already broken the first rule of not talking to the police and have given them your passwords and sent yourself to jail.<br />
