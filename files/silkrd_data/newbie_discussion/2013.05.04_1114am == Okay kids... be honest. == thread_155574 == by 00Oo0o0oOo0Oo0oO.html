				I think a lot of the really young users here are from the US. I doubt they&#039;re going to admit to their age on here though. Their level of paranoia generally hints at how old they are. When you see someone freaking out over ordering 1g of hash and posting on the forum about how much trouble they&#039;re going to get in you can take a rough guess at their age. <br /><br />I saw one vendor having issues with some kid that ordered something like 1/2 lb of weed to their house and decided, after it was posted, to go nuts and start panic-messaging the vendor asking them to stop it. It&#039;s pretty funny to see, but must be a real pain in the ass for vendors.

				You could be 30+ and be dumb as fuck because you&#039;ve been living under a rock.<br />At the same time you could be 16+ with rare mentality values (positive ones) because you&#039;re street wise/eager to learn/pure lucky.<br />Just saying..

				i am 37 years old. i&#039;ve been in the underground scene since i was about 16. the youngins are ignorant as to the ways of the market. they are mostly harmless. it is likely, however, that the attackers hitting SR atm are under 22 years of age, based on what i have observed over years of watching drug forums and IRC chatrooms. they are probably even being wooed into doing this nastiness by promises of drugs or some other bullshit. this is why, although this reveals a serious security vulnerability, there is no big reason to be worried. <br /><br />as i point out in this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0 there is at least two things that users of SR can do to reduce the impact of these dumbasses. neither of them are terribly difficult to do, and as i say in the post, i am most happy to help out, though i am fading as it is late in the evening and may not be back on to answer questions for another 6-8 hours depending on when i decide to crash.<br /><br />we were all young once, and some of us still are, and aren&#039;t dumbasses. divide and conquer will not work here.
