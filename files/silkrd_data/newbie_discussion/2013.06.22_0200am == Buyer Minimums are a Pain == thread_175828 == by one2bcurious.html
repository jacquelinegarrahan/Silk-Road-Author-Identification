				I understand why they exist but for well-meaning buyers such as myself who are looking for something very specific and reasonably priced, it is a huge pain in the ass because it seems like the best sellers have minimum stats.&nbsp; I hate wasting my money with undesirable or expensive items just to pad them.

				Keep looking around.&nbsp; There&#039;s plenty of other vendors that&#039;ll suit your needs.

				Yes, but the vendors with the product I want at the best prices have minimums.&nbsp; I go through all the time and compare prices and do calculations.

				I have no minimums&nbsp; :)<br />Sorry, might not have the prod you want though. So are you saying that you are looking at listings for say 3.5g of whatever but you are required to buy 8 items before you can check out? Or are you looking at a price for a pound, dividing it up to what you want and wishing you could get that price for a lesser amount? I&#039;m pretty new here and just haven&#039;t heard of minimums. If it is the prior situation I would agree with you. Why would someone make a listing for some smaller amount than they were actually willing to sell? Good luck on your search for what you are wanting! Im sure you&#039;ll find something that should make you happy.&nbsp; ;D

				Try out some new vendors without an established reputation. You might get ripped off sure but more than likely you also might get a great deal!!! New vendors tend not to require that.<br /><br />
