				Can&#039;t they implement some sort of other &#039;spam&#039; prevention system? I mean this whole thing is to prevent those BTC bot scam/spam websites to stop from spamming the main board categories, and yet the normal members who actually post decently and participate within the forums are exiled and made to spam themselves until they can work their way up... aghh... this is getting way too annoying. <br /><br />If they had more moderators this sort of thing wouldn&#039;t happen.

				The thing is there are a lot of effective methods of preventing spam bots, however most of them would require members to loose some of their anonymity, which moderators/administrators are trying to protect, so I can understand why they won&#039;t implement some stricter methods of spam prevention. <br /><br />But there is always one, why not make the forum invite only?&nbsp; ::)

				I would like to contribute reviews to some of the review threads, especially SuperTrips since it seems there are a lot people who are disheartened by him right now, but i&#039;m not going to waste my time spamming 50 posts to be able to do so.
