				.7 BTC for sale, MP only, out of escrow. I would NEVER advocate or advertise this, since I did it once in 2011 and got burned to the tune of $160. My end is secure and legit (2 year member, and NO, my forum name does not match my&nbsp; SR name, nor do I have a seller account), just needing money to pay for rent this month coming up in three days. Make me an offer per PM (are newbies allowed to PM even? lol Couple years back there wasn&#039;t even a rule on newbies not being able to post, let alone a newbie forum) or respond on here and I&#039;ll make sure you get the coin as soon as I have the agreed upon amount per MP.&nbsp; Looking to get $100 MP, so don&#039;t make yourself look like a moron by lowballing me publicly.<br /><br />To compensate you for taking an out of escrow risk, I&#039;d offer some advice, answer some questions, even point you in the direction of a reputable vendor.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, feel free to pile on as well. Talk is cheap, but numbers and cred don&#039;t lie. Scoreboard.

Liquidated some on there and minimum to fund escrow is 1 BTC, so instead of purchasing .3 more to post another listing, I figured I&#039;d offer it on here while educating a newb or two. I may purchase the extra .3 to post a trade or sell at a manageable loss, market-depending. Thanks for replying.<br />

				Sell it on the BTC OTC. You have bitcoins, they have money. They also have bitcoins too, but the point is you need to pay rent. Say just that.

Could you go ahead and delete the post or at the very least lock the thread? I&#039;d hate for newbs to get the idea that off-site non-escrow transaction are a good idea, EVER. BTC sold, not to anyone here, but yeah, this post was a bit uncouth. <br /><br />newbs, I do apologize, I just was in a tight spot with rent. Still not an excuse to post an ad. Listen to guys like Libertas, they are almost always right.
