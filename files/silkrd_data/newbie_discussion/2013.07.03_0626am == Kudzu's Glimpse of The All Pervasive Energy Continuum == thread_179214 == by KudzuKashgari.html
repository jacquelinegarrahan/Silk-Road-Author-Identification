				Part 1:&nbsp; Preparations<br /><br />To save my fellow psychonauts the disappointment, this is not a post about a psychedelic induced state.&nbsp; This is an experience I had during a four hour meditation session.&nbsp; It happened almost 2 years ago, when I was going through some really rough times (I&#039;ll spare you the depressing details) and I needed a serious breakthrough in my life.<br />First, I sparked up a small pipe-full of my ganja to clear my mind and get rid of my anxiety.&nbsp; Then I sat down on my bed, crossed my legs, and put on a blindfold.&nbsp; Meditating is kind of like a game; you have to pop thoughts like little soap bubbles if you want to get really deep.&nbsp; After about a half hour I started to see patterns, wavy, flowing, colorful ebbs that drifted upward.&nbsp; I tried to just let them pass, as I didn&#039;t want to cling to anything however pleasant or terrifying it may be.&nbsp; This is where I lost track of linear time.<br />My next vision was of going &#039;up&#039;.&nbsp; My perception framework of up, down, right, left, forward, and backward completely disappeared.

				Part 2:&nbsp; Things Get Weird<br /><br />Suddenly, I see a glittering serpent of goliath proportions staring at me.&nbsp; It is curled into a circle, with its head in the center.&nbsp; Radiating from the center is the whole light spectrum.&nbsp; The rainbow serpent is covered in what looks like glittering gems.&nbsp; When we recognize each other, it uncurls itself so that all I can see is its head.&nbsp; It opens its mouth and comes toward me.&nbsp; I am not afraid, even though I know that this is my moment of death.&nbsp; I pass through the rainbow serpent, and I am in the energy continuum.&nbsp; All that I can see is a great eye, its outermost edge is infinity, and I am drawn into its pupil.&nbsp; The eye you see the universe with is the eye you see the universe with.&nbsp; This is when I get afraid.&nbsp; When I remove my blindfold, I can see that the walls look as though they are made of an opaque liquid, flowing with the energy in the room.

				Part 3:&nbsp; Ramifications In The Earthly Domain<br /><br />For days, even weeks, I feel a positive mood change.&nbsp; This was the breakthrough I needed, a relief for my soul.&nbsp; I talk about it openly with nearly everyone I know, and make some good connections as a result.&nbsp; One chat I had stands out to me in memory though, I was talking about it with an open minded friend with similar experiences.&nbsp; He smiled and nodded as I told him my tale.&nbsp; The people with us at the time were less open minded, however.&nbsp; It was like they had a mental block to it, and this is when I realized that I had entered the realm of &#039;taboo&#039;.&nbsp; Though I could tell they were listening, they had a glazed expression to their eyes, like they were trying to block it out.&nbsp; Maybe it scared them.&nbsp; Through the grapevine, you can often learn more about how someone thinks about you than you can talking to them face to face.&nbsp; I had turned on, tuned in, but this is the moment that I learned you have to drop out.
