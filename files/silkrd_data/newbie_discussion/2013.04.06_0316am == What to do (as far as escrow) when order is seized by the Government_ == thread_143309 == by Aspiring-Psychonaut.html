				I recently had an order that was seized by a certain drug agency of a certain government. Fortunately I and the friend whose address it was being sent to had taken all the precautions and knew how to handle it when the agents came, and we&#039;re in the clear legally. However, I don&#039;t know how to handle it as far as the order on The Silk Road. I looked through these here forums and other sites and couldn&#039;t find an answer. Should I ask for a refund? What to do?&nbsp; ???

				Read the vendors page, they should have a section on refunds, depending on your stats will depend on refund/reship, but contact the vendor anyway.
