				Weed is safe in a sense that it can&#039;t kill you. But, it can do pretty weird things to ones mental health. <br /><br />Like one of my best friends, let&#039;s call him X. Whenever X smokes weed he gets unbelievable paranoid, thinks the police are coming for him and that they are going to find his stash (he is a dealer) and he goes in to total meltdown mode. <br /><br />The very first time it happened to him, he had about 150 grams of blow in his house and he couldn&#039;t find any of his burner phones, which made him think the police had them and that they were coming to bust him, and he was going to hang himself. Over and over he was just screaming... <br /><br />&quot;They are coming for me! Let me kill myself, I&#039;m not going to jail!!&quot;<br /><br />Which was pretty fucking freaky, but there was a group of us which meant we managed to subdue him easily so that he couldn&#039;t actually do anything. So, he was lucky to have us there when it happened. <br /><br />We considered it a one off, and then attributed it to lack of sleep and the fact that we had, had a heavy night on alcohol/blow the previous night. <br /><br />A couple of weeks later, we smoked some more weed.. The strongest stuff I&#039;ve smoked to this day. And something similar happened to X again, he went in to melt-down mode, but instead of trying to kill himself,&nbsp; he flushed about $4000 worth of Coke down the toilet. I tried to subdue him and stop him but he is a much bigger guy than me, so he fought me off easily and flushed it. <br /><br />An hour later, the weed had worn off and he went in to a deep depression because he realised he was a massive twat for flushing it all. Losing 4 grand can&#039;t be good for your health...<br /><br />... And as you could have probably guessed he doesn&#039;t smoke/eat weed anymore. <br /><br />The first of many riveting tales you&#039;re going to hear from: MrAnonymous&nbsp; :)

				I think that GHB (or it&#039;s pro-drug GBL) is one of the safest/best drugs from the SilkRoad. It is always pure, because it is CHEAP enough that no one would ever cut it. It is very safe as long as it is not mixed with depressants, like alcohol, and the effects are simply MAGIC!<br />Everyone should look into it and give it a try! It&#039;s a wonderful euphoric and empathogenic drug that doesn&#039;t deplete your brain the way many of the research chemicals do. It can be used up to several times per week if you really want to without extreme side effects. <br />A superb party drug, you should all try it at least once!<br />~CopperOctagon

				MDMA is very euphoric with little known long term effects. Check out reddit.com/r/mdma for dosage tips, preloading, postloading, etc. I usually take 5htp for a few days before using MDMA and the day after to avoid &quot;depression&quot; like hangovers.

				Nothing annoys me more than people who say that marijuana has no side effects.<br /><br />It can and will lead to paranoia with a lot of its users -- I&#039;m not here to preach to you all, you can do whatever drugs you want (this is The Silk Road of course), but do not give this person the impression that it&#039;s as safe as aspirin. I know, it sounds like I&#039;m being a wowzer, but I&#039;m speaking from personal experience of myself and friends, smoking weed for an extended period of time (I&#039;d say longer than 12-24 months) will leave you with long term issues. I smoked daily for 3 years, and now deal with paranoia and anxiety that I did not deal with before that. Before I started (at the age of 18), I was outgoing, social, and had great confidence -- after smoking for a couple of years I became an introvert, socially awkward, and thought everybody else was talking about me behind my back. Now not only did I deal with that, but so did some of the people I was smoking with and some of their friends. So, speaking from personal experience -- hydroponic marijuana can definitely had negative, long term side effects.<br /><br />I&#039;ve smoked bush recently though and it&#039;s been great, none of the negatives associated with when I was smoking the potent hydro.<br /><br />As far as safest drug, I would have to say MDMA -- it&#039;s not going to give you visuals (so inexperienced psychonauts needn&#039;t worry), if it&#039;s clean and in a decent dosage (big enough to get a proper roll, small enough to not put you into come-down territory), it makes you feel great and very sociable and isn&#039;t as long lasting as say, meth or LSD. Perfect for sharing a night with a (group of) loved one(s) or even at a party, however -- like other drugs, abuse can lead to permanent damage to your brain. I stick to the once every couple of months rule :)

				I would feel comfortable in saying that as long as you do your research, do proper testing on the products you receive (to ensure it is what is advertised), do an allergy test and stay within guidelines of usage (mg/kg) that most drugs are safe on SR. When you start trying to go further and further chasing the ultimate high is when you run into problems.

				hi all,<br />tricky question.<br />Pure opiates do not cause any damage to bodily tissues, but everything needs to be metabolized, and will take some kind of toll and as far as i know, all classical psychedelics are safe if you are healthy, even fairly high doses.<br />DMT is metabolized down to nothing out of the ordinary within an hour. Short acting,and physically harmless, however psychologically very powerful.<br />The golden rule is: Pay Attention to the Three S&#039;s<br /><br />-Substance-research the substance, research your vendor<br />-Set- (mindset) this is up to you. if you are open minded and in a good mood, you&#039;ll be fine.<br />-Setting- your environment, including others that you share it with and your internal physiology(health/other medications)<br /><br />&nbsp;btw RCs are called such because they were designed by modern scientists, based on previous research, then subjected to more research. (read Shulgin.)this is only as opposed to the trial and error method of the old days (which was also research). Everything in life has both good and bad effects<br />&nbsp;Psychedelics can open your eyes and mind to real reality<br />Don&#039;t worry be happy<br />peace<br />

				Scopolamine is some mighty safe stuff :-) just kidding, read up on it, its an incredibly sinister drug, a potent deliriant which isnt taken recreationally often, over a few milligrams has a zombifying effect. In columbia it grows wild and its used for robberies and rape because people will do anything you say on it. Read a trip report, its an evil drug. Fair play if you want to try it but i dont see how it can look appealing once you know about it. VICE done a documentary on it in columbia about how its used and what it does etc, Look it up if you want, google vice scopolamine if you have some spare time
