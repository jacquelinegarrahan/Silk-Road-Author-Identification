				I have 6 days left before my order auto-finalizes. My vendor has been in contact with me, although he takes a little while to get back to me. I&#039;ve asked for tracking numbers and he said he&#039;d get them but it&#039;s been 2 days. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to speed him up, if possible. Should I go to resolution and tell them I want an extension, or should I message the vendor to remind him that there are only 6 days left and that time is running out? I&#039;m assuming that he wouldn&#039;t want to be involved with resolution, but I&#039;m not sure how that works. <br /><br />Any advice?

				Just click resolve and extend by 10 - 15 days in resolution center. Easy.. you can still release the funds anytime you want and you don&#039;t have to accept any proposed resolutions if you don&#039;t want to <br /><br />well ... <br /><br />more or less, <br /><br />like so long as your being reasonable and if like me you would rather keep 0% refund in stats you can knock back a refund of 50% or whatever and release funds if that&#039;s as good as it gets and its not worth the stats stain to you. Like say its a $80 order and so your offered 40 refund well to me its not worth it so I&#039;ll just release the funds and reflect my experience in the feedback and on here..<br /><br />This way its still in the system and your able to have some options still. The vendor will accept the extension or if AWOL the SR staff should grant it anyway and then your still protected if it turns out something has gone awry..<br /><br />:-D<br /><br />BanDit

				i WILL extend it if necessary, but i really don&#039;t want to give him an extra 10-15 days! this was seriously the last of my money and i&#039;m not cool with paying $45 for this fucking headache (that is %50). <br /><br />if it&#039;s the vendor&#039;s issue--if he &quot;lost&quot; tracking, etc, then why should I have to take a hit? I don&#039;t understand that. It doesn&#039;t seem like I have ANY way of getting him to hurry up with the communication. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, i&#039;m just really frustrated. Plus i&#039;m on maintenance at a daily clinic so I spent a week being sick and waiting for the mail. there&#039;s no way i&#039;m letting that slide unless it was an honest mistake.
