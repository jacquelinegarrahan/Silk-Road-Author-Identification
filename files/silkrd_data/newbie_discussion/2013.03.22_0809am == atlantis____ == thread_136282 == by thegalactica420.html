				I took a look and Atlantis seems pretty solid to me. <br /><br />As DoctorNoname says, it is rather similar to SR, but there seem to be some coding improvements that make it more stable for the user. From what little I have seen there are some other more advanced features too, like full GPG key integration.<br /><br />It can&#039;t hurt to get a username over there or for some vendors to set up shop over there in case SR ever gets taken down by LE, or there is extended downtime. The admins there, from the posts I saw on their forum, have their priorities straight and seem like reliable types. Out of the three SR alternatives I know, Black Market Reloaded is untrustworthy, Sheep Market admins don&#039;t speak English, so Atlantis is the best alternative.<br /><br />I have posted a couple of things on their forum, ideas for features and so on. They seem open to ideas that have not been acted on here. Time will tell, of course, but competition is a good thing for everyone.

Reinventing the wheel is pointless when you have a working and time tested wheel. <br /><br />As for it being a &#039;lazy ripoff&#039; that is far from true, months and months of development time have gone into the initial release, and the development team has been working NON STOP on implementing new features and changes to enhance the user experience. We take feedback very seriously and have already implemented at least 10 user requested features within the very first week of launch.<br /><br />We&#039;re offering 3 months commission free and a free vendor account to any reputable SR or BMR sellers, just message support on the Atlantis website.

				Sorry, I realize I came across a little harsh there.

It can be awkward for a lot of people to buy BTC in the first place let alone Litecoins, but hopefully this will change with growing acceptance of these currencies as a medium of exchange.<br /><br />As a vendor I have enough points where I loose percentages when cashing out that I don&#039;t really want to add any more, from my point of view that makes Litecoins problematic as there would be at least one more step.<br /><br />Perhaps you could explain to me your reasons for choosing Litecoin as BTC seems so much more established<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Yeah... I&#039;m gonna have to agree. Atlantis seems a little fishy. The site runs flawlessly but the layout is almost identical to SR aside from the pretty bells and whistles it has here and there. I&#039;d steer clear of that website. <br /><br />

				I stand corrected on the java script. <br /><br />Just logged in without it. First time I couldn&#039;t log in unless I enabled it. There was no error or anything. I just couldn&#039;t log in after several tries. But that could have been a qwerk that day. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong I am not saying there is anything wrong with the site. I hope it is a great market. BMR really isn&#039;t a good alternative to SR. More competition is better for the markets. <br /><br />I am just saying there is no way to know yet. <br /><br />However, the pin (not the password) is only 5 characters long now there may be a way to change that but that seems to be the default setting. I&#039;ll sign up to the forum there and ask. <br /><br />The java thing seemed odd to me but but you answered my question on that.<br /><br />That and the pin made me wonder about security. <br /><br />The only thing I know about lite coins is that they exist. Never needed to know more than that because every deep web site uses bitcoins. I haven&#039;t had a chance to look into them yet to see if they are as vulnerable as people say.<br /><br />It is going to be interesting to see how things go over there. <br /><br />I would suggest they don&#039;t allow FE at all. We had a few problems with that here. Good way to learn from the mistakes of others.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your market is just new. It won&#039;t take long for you to get going. Once it does word will get around. <br /><br />Thanks for stopping by to answer questions.<br />

				I think the the thing that actually makes Silk Road is DPR. He has managed to keep this site safe from Authorities for years now. It doesn&#039;t matter how good an alternative looks, if it it gets compromised by LE or the creator rolls over&nbsp; people are going to get busted for selling drugs over the Internet, why take the chance when you know nothing about the site or use a relatively untested digital currency like litecoin.

				Exactly right. Aside from the obvious Sr is as much about staying safe, and how to protect your privacy which is not easy in todays world. <br /><br />SR has had a few problems and came out as strong as ever. People have confidence in DPR. Weather you agree with it or not he started from&nbsp; an idea that people rally around which is just as important to him as making money. <br /><br />We have seen how he works to preserve anonymity and keep the site as safe as possible. Scammers aren&#039;t given free ragin to do as they please here which he very well could allow since he would still profit those transactions. LE and congress have put pressure on the site to no avail. <br /><br />Other sites have fallen while SR still stands or some have become completely over run by scammers. Scams exist here but they are not nearly as bad on other sites. <br /><br />The question of safety is a serious concern. No one knows much about the new site. How will they protect the site from scams? How well are disputes handled? What measures is the site taking to protect the community from government intrusion? <br /><br />Like I said, only time will tell and the site may well prove itself. I for one hope it does. It would be great to see a new site thrive. Good luck.

Seems to me they would be better off using bitcoins. <br /><br />I have no idea if they allow FE but I would hope not. <br /><br />I would also like to wait and see how the escrow system and admin handles scams. <br /><br />It may well turn out to be a great market. Only time will tell. Competition would be great so I hope it turns out to be a legit market.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Java? No, you don&#039;t. You don&#039;t even need Javascript enabled either. It just gives you some nice tooltips and other things but they aren&#039;t imperative to the function of the site. Read the post directly above yours for more info on misconceptions being spread throughout here.<br /><br />You are as anonymous (if not more anonymous given automatic GPG encryption) as you are on SR.<br /><br />Pin is not restricted to 5 characters and never has been.<br /><br />FE is restricted to Verified Sellers or sellers with high 5/5 reputation, check the guides for more info.<br /><br />Definitely not a scam site, that would be counter productive... There&#039;s more money to be made by being legitimate business.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was beginning to think Atlantis might be a great alternative/adjunct to Silk Road, but I have a couple questions/comments.<br /><br />Why can you not change your location after you initially select it?&nbsp; People move... I do, and want to keep the reputation that would take months to build.<br /><br />IMHO, any site on TOR that allows javascript period is not security conscious.&nbsp; Even if some people use the site for legitimate purchases and have no need for anonymity, the ENTIRE reason it should be on TOR is so that it&#039;s completely anonymous.&nbsp; Otherwise you might as well use Ebay or Amazon...&nbsp; They have anything legitimate one might want to purchase legitimately..<br /><br />Your &quot;secure&quot; passphrase only allow UP TO 20 characters, but a minimum of 6?... why the limit?&nbsp; It should enable and encourage the user to be as anonymous as possible.<br /><br />The main focus should be security.&nbsp; I really like the fact that they&#039;re basically fixing all the annoying things about Silk Road and becoming more user friendly, and the PGP encryption embedded is really nice.&nbsp; But security should be first and foremost.&nbsp; Otherwise what&#039;s the point?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why can you not change your location after you initially select it?&nbsp; People move...

You can change it as often as you like.<br /><br />IMHO, any site on TOR that allows javascript period is not security conscious.&nbsp; Even if some people use the site for legitimate purchases and have no need for anonymity, the ENTIRE reason it should be on TOR is so that it&#039;s completely anonymous.&nbsp; Otherwise you might as well use Ebay or Amazon...&nbsp; They have anything legitimate one might want to purchase legitimately..<br /><br />&gt;&gt; As a web developer I can tell you this is simply not true. There is absolutely zero reason why Javascript should not be used if the source is trusted. The only way it could potentially become a security issue is if&nbsp; we had imbedded Javascript in pages to send home information that was otherwise unattainable server side. We do no such thing and wouldn&#039;t compromise the publics trust by doing something so silly. You and anyone else are free to review all of the Javascript on the website. The amount of Javascript we use is very minimal, to display tooltips or enlarge product images in a floating window, and that is it. Implying that Atlantis isn&#039;t security conscious because it allows Javascript implies a lack of understanding of Javascript.<br /><br />Your &quot;secure&quot; passphrase only allow UP TO 20 characters, but a minimum of 6?... why the limit?&nbsp; It should enable and encourage the user to be as anonymous as possible.<br /><br />&gt;&gt; There is a minimum password length on our site, and most security conscious websites, because passwords under 6 characters are EXTREMELY easy to bruteforce. You may as well have no password at all if this is the case. The number of permutations of a password ranging from 6-20 characters is so unbelievably large.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure why you have security doubts? I can promise you, as someone coming from a security background, our practices are far more secure than that of SilkRoad.
