				After finding drug vendors on the clearnet&nbsp; ( CLEAR NET WARNING see&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.topix.com/forum/drug/valium/TCN640HGS4FFDFVLH&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CLEAR NET WARNING ) that operate it seems with impunity, take forms of payment we wished we could use on SR. What would be the chances that Silk Road might move to the clear net?

				When marijuana is legal the world over, they could have a Silk Road Lite version on the clearnet. With legal but drug related items. You know kind of like giving kids candy cigarettes, so they find cigarettes appealing when they get older. Not that I really thing that candy cigarettes are bad, because I don&#039;t.<br />&nbsp;But like giving the newb a clear net version of SR, where he can buy a bootable USB with Tails and Tor.<br /><br />

				Not exactly, they access the site with anonymous browsers and use Reload packs mostly as cash. It is all done anonymously on the clearnet. It is a TOR friendly site were newbs buy and sell all of the time. I am sure that some of the SR sellers got there start on Topixt really this just a good conversation for me to get my 50 with LOLOL<br /><br />&nbsp;The DEA wouldn&#039;t be interested in the small shit that happens on Topix, but local authorities might.

				You have a delivery system here also, when you make an order you put YOUR address in the box that gets encrypted, out there you use Privnote or destructmessage.com.<br />&nbsp;Point being that you still do the same here

				Is Tor too tricky for you? PGP a nightmare?<br />Yeah, let&#039;s all go to the clearweb and use privnote, maybe credit cards. [/sarcasm]<br /><br />FFS....even in the Netherlands, I encrypt my address before ordering Molly - and NO ONE CARES HERE.<br />In any other, more repressive regime (like anwhere...) put as many layers of obfuscation between yourself and LE as you can, and everyone is happier. Even LE is happier, as they can go bust some crooks....

				I agree but we are talking extremely newb here, I mean these guys give out gmail and hotmail email addresses in their PM&#039;s to each other. That I would think be very identifying. No one is really getting busted though, certianly not the dealers. A couple a buyers got busted with some weed, but it was so petty the police didn&#039;t even jail him. I think he bought a 1/2 OZ or something.

				It shows also that we are winning the war on drugs (war with drugs), you know that communication technology and the internet is making it nearly impossible to investigate and violate peoples rights. Just like everywhere police say about SR &quot;We can&#039;t do anything about it&quot;

				The police say &quot;we can&#039;t do anything about it&quot; because it is back-boned by Tor anonymity.&nbsp; Once you take things over to the clearweb; it&#039;s a different story.&nbsp; I am a top level information security person whom works for DoD.&nbsp; If you&#039;re dealing drugs on the clearweb, it&#039;s only a matter of time before you&#039;ll be indicted on charges of conspiracy, trafficking, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t be silly.&nbsp; I should say... don&#039;t be stupid.&nbsp; ::)
