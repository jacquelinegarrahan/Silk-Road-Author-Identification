				Okay I dont really know much about methylone... I do know that my fiance is basically allergic to amphetamines.. Adderall ,mdma, any ecstasy makes her super sick....&nbsp; The first time she tried one she said it was great....I personally thought they were weak.... Is methylone worse, better than mdma or ecstasy..&nbsp; Not like euphoric wise more like damaging to the body... recovery.&nbsp; I have never heard much about it

				Some people just can&#039;t tolerate stimulants and I would advise you not to encourage her to take more of them. Methylone is way more mellow than MDMA. It has very strong empathneogenic qualities but not as powerful an energy/euphoria rush. I find it more psychedelic and less speedy in general. It has an easier comedown compared to MDMA and little hangover. This is still an RC though, and a stimulant, and therefore not a very healthy thing to put in your body any way you look at it. I do because I accept the consequences and consider it a fair trade. Hard to see why you&#039;d want to put your fiancee through that again though.

				methelone mimcs some of the effects of MDMA and amphetamines. However, if you&#039;re looking for an &#039;e&#039; high you will not find it with methylone.<br /><br />methylone also makes on want to redose compulsively. i&#039;m not sure what family of chemical methylone falls into, but i feel it is related to amphetamines.<br /><br />hard to say which is &#039;worse,&#039; really depends how responisbly you use the drug

It was originally patented by Jacob Peyton and Alexander Shulgin in 1996 as an antidepressant.[2] The more intuitive abbreviation MDMC cannot be used for this chemical, since it had already been given to another earlier Shulgin creation, 3,4-ethylenedioxymethamphetamine. Methylone is a close structural analogue of MDMA, differing by the addition of a β-ketone group.[3]

				The cornucopia of psychedelics and party drugs we now enjoy would be a small basket of tryptamines, opiates, and amphetamines without his lifelong dedication. Virtually no new substances have been discovered since his health decline in recent years. One of the greatest unsung researchers of the 20th century.
