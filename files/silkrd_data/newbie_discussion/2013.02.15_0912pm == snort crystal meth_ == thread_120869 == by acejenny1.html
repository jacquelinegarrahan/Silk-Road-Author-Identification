				I have maybe a really dumb question.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a crystal meth usuer, normally.&nbsp; But a couple of years ago I went on an epic 10 day vacation fueled by smoking crystal meth, awesome music and a beautiful fucking road-trip.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t used it since, and it was fun smoking it, but I dont&#039; want to do that again.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m wondering: can you chop that shit up and snort it?

				lol the general&nbsp; concensus is that snorting is one step back from smoking ;)<br /><br />Yes, I put the shards under a dollar bill, seal the edges so crystals won&#039;t pop out, and crush it to a powder with the bottom side of a lighter. Don&#039;t forget to scrape the hangers on from the dollar bill! It&#039;ll burn a little, but I actually enjoy the burn.<br /><br />You can also eat it, this is my preferred method of ingestion, even beyond IV injection. The high takes a few minutes to come on, but you get a body rush that lasts and lasts. Great fun, great sex!

				burns like a bastard and throbs in the temple, eyes gushing tears and for a minute or 5 you will wonder why you did that... but then depends on what you doing and how you wanna get high... i agree with twonenathandjoe, ingetsting gives a really nice body rush if you willing to wait a little longer. with ingesting, depends on how much you ingest i found. if you talking points, maybe better IVing or smoking :/

				Definitely<br />thats how we used to do it before smoking it became popular. Just chop it up real fine and get ready for it to burn the shit outta your nose. Then prepare for a nasty tasting drip.The high is more of a sustained high for a little longer period, with a faster crash..

That being said, I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s more harmful than smoking, just has different risks.
