				Same situation as you kind of.<br /><br />Ordered with CMT on Thursday night, added express shipping. He marked it in transit the next day and so far the package has not arrived. If it&#039;s not here by Thursday I gotta throw it into Resolution.<br /><br />I am assuming he hasn&#039;t shipped it yet since it should of been here today if shipped out Friday like it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Sick of vendors off their game.

				Same boat as you guys pretty much.<br /><br />I ordered Friday afternoon, he marked my order In Transit some time today, but I doubt he shipped it. He probably marked everyones order In Transit and just logged off. Now 3 poor saps have just finalized early, their money is probably gone.<br /><br />He only logged on once the entire weekend, and it was for what must&#039;ve been a minute or two. Makes me worried. It seems he has a habit of this disappearing act, based on another thread, and his feedback. He just likes to sporadically disappear. Shady practices like this should just result in an immediate ban.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping someone can ease my mind and tell me they went through the same shit and eventually got their order and everything was fine, but I&#039;m not holding my breath, it&#039;s not looking good.

				Wow. 3 hours before I could cancel my order, he decided to mark it in transit. My messages are still unread. If I find out he didn&#039;t actually ship today he&#039;s getting a fat 1/5 for being a fucking dirtbag. If you can&#039;t handle the order volume, go stealth for fuck sake.

The timeline of events from what I can tell is, he disappeared Thursday evening, logged on for just a second on Saturday evening, then showed up again sometime today, in the late afternoon or evening, and marked everyones orders in transit.<br /><br />Since he disappeared from Thursday to today, I just don&#039;t believe he had time to get to my order from Friday, package it, and drop it off, especially with the massive backlog he must have due to his sales, and the whole disappearing thing.<br /><br />But who knows. Maybe he&#039;ll come through. One thing for sure is though, he does this shit often. I just don&#039;t understand it, an emergency might come up once in a great while and it&#039;s understandable, but even still, pretty much everyone comes home and has access to a computer at least once a day. And if you&#039;re a vendor, you should make fucking sure of it.

				I mean it&#039;s _possible_ that he spent the weekend grinding away at the baggies getting everyone&#039;s order packed up, but there&#039;s no way to tell. Absolutely zero communication. There&#039;s so many ways he could solve this problem-- go stealth, find someone to handle communications, anything. I can&#039;t say I feel any sympathy.

				Awesome! The tiny shred of hope I did have for my package showing up tomorrow is now gone after reading this discussion. I placed my order with CMT last Friday morning with express shipping, and he marked it &quot;in transit&quot; around 7 pm on Monday night!! No package and no response to my message. And maybe I am missing something here so correct me if I am wrong, but aren&#039;t all USPS express envelopes priced using a flat rate of $19.95 for all domestic shipments? C.M.T charges $31 for express, but I believe he uses the Flat Rate Express envelopes for all his express shipments, again correct me if I am wrong. <br /><br />I hate getting my hopes up before I go out and check the mailbox, because it&#039;s such a fucking let down when you walk away with nothing more than a handful of junk mail. When your package is a no-show day after day the feeling is similar to when you were a kid opening the last present under the tree on Christmas morning and you&#039;re tearing the wrapping paper off as fast as you can, but your hopes are destroyed when you realize it&#039;s just a sweater with reindeer on it, and that Red Rider BB gun was just a pipe dream.

				Anyone know how much I&#039;ll actually get back, if and when my order goes into Resolution? Never had to resort to this before, after many, many successful purchases. <br /><br />If I get a percentage, like 25% or 50%, that&#039;s bullshit. But the guy has no case, can&#039;t provide a tracking number for an order he never shipped, doesn&#039;t respond to messages, disappears for days at a time. He probably won&#039;t even try to fight it at all. And there will probably be a flood of other orders of his going into resolution in the same timeframe, if not the same day, exposing him for the worthless scammer he is, maybe even result in a ban. Hopefully I&#039;ll get all of my money back, right? After SR commission fee, I assume.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s pretty obvious what his scam is. Be a legitimate vendor for a couple weeks, make people happy and earn their trust and feedback, offer free shipping for finalizing early, disappear and watch the flood of FE&#039;s come in, make off with the bitcoins. This is why I never FE, under any circumstances. Why even risk your entire order just to save a few bucks in shipping? But of course CMT is the main culprit here.

				I&#039;ve made successful transactions with him, but he&#039;s done things like print other customers&#039; names and addresses on the inner package, and his return addresses are implausible. Stealth improved a lot, and until recently, shipping was timely.&nbsp; I, too, have not heard a peep from him. I know he&#039;s been reported at least once, and by now, multiple times. I recently had to reject a package from him because I was asked to sign, and for all I know, in retrospect, he probably forgot to check the &quot;waive signature&quot; box. All that paranoia, worry, and $$ down the toilet for nothing. And now the package is probably floating around the dead letter office, with my name on it, where it will eventually be opened.<br /><br />Seems like a nice guy with some good features in his business model, but too flaky and unreliable for my taste. A shame.

				It came! Finally, it came!<br /><br />My 2g of tar came in today and the quality was good as expected. Weight was dead on. Shipment was express so I&#039;m guessing he shipped tuesday since it was coast to coast. He put (edit: removed. something similar to his SR handle) in the return address. Why? What&#039;s the point?

				So since all of you that paid for Express, I guess I can expect my priority package sometime in June?&nbsp; :P&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing all of the packages that he marked in transit Monday night (mine included) he actually dropped them Tuesday.

				Wow, I was not expecting that, but I&#039;m happy for you and your package arriving safely JSherman. I was sure he hadn&#039;t shipped anything, I guess I was wrong. I take back all of my presumptions about Charlie, but still, he needs to fucking get it together. Now I&#039;m just wondering when I&#039;ll get my Priority package, if ever. I&#039;m betting Saturday, at the earliest.<br /><br />USPS is having some massive delays, it seems. I&#039;ve never had a Priority package take more than 2 days, or Express take more than 1, even when everyone else was having problems. But just this past week, a very trustworthy vendor said he dropped my package Saturday morning Priority, in which case it would normally get here Monday, and it didn&#039;t get here till Wednesday.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=158837.msg1134794#msg1134794">Quote from: KrotchKricket on May 16, 2013, 08:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Was your express package delivered separately from your regular mail?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Mine always are.

				Um...so this is concerning.&nbsp; I just logged on to SR and all of his listings are gone but it still says he hasn&#039;t been seen for 3 days.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing SR admins have suspended him or something?&nbsp; Not surprising by his utter lack of any communication what so ever.&nbsp; Being fairly new, It&#039;s things like this that make me a nervous wreck and fear for my safety in regards to getting busted.

				Have you considered what it might mean to identify the packages sent by this vendor by announcing his use of a return alias and identifying the area from which he sends the product? <br /><br />It allows for instant identification of packages containing drugs to anyone who might be concerned with finding them, and it helps to locate the vendor.<br /><br />If I were Charlie I would not appreciate my customers broadcasting these details.

				This is bullshit. Going on 8 days from order, 6 days since in transit. Withdrawls: Over, Detoxt:Done. Might as well just quit now.<br /><br />I live in the same fucking state as this dude, first class mail would have arrived by now. The only reason I have any hope of receiving anything is another package I had ordered that is not SR related got misrouted and it is possible that the 2 packages were both misrouted together. Likely nothing every shipped. <br /><br />This could just be coincidental but I searched police reports for the general area where I think Charlie is from and there was an arrest that fits the timeline of Charlie going dark. This is 100% speculation. Certain facts just fit. I hope I am wrong. Not going to post any references because I don&#039;t want to give away where he is from on the off chance I am even correct.

				This is indeed getting pretty ridiculous. <br /><br />But he still gets a couple pieces of feedback each day, with people saying they waited 5 days since it was marked In Transit. So maybe they&#039;re still on the way. It&#039;s pretty obvious that the last orders he shipped were on Monday/Tuesday, probably marked them in transit Monday and dropped them off Tuesday. He&#039;s disappeared completely since then. So as long as the feedback keeps rolling in, I still have a little bit of hope.<br /><br />But holy shit this is excruciating. Worst order I&#039;ve ever had. Whether I get my order or not, Charlie is still either a scammer or lazy, incompetent vendor, and I&#039;ll be advising everyone not to order from him.
