				Ladies and gentlemen, if you don&#039;t want to read the whole report then I&#039;ll just start off by saying that Foxcave&#039;s powdered &#039;Golden Teacher&#039; shrooms are some of the best I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of trying :)<br /><br />Ok, so I ordered 3.5g of the shrooms before the winter holidays and they took about 3 weeks to arrive in southern Europe, which isn&#039;t too bad considering the time of year. I never had to communicate with Foxcave; I ordered and he sent, end of story. The packaging was excellent - it was vacuum sealed, flat, and there was absolutely no smell at all. My .01 scale is broken at the moment so I couldn&#039;t get an accurate weight on the shrooms, but my crude kitchen scale showed them to be around 5g - significantly more than the 3.5g I ordered. <br /><br />The first time I tried these shrooms was a couple of weeks ago, at around 9pm at night. I took around 1g of the powder, which when mixed into a glass with orange juice is pretty easy to swallow. The powder had that typical shroomy taste, and was a pretty uniform texture. About 30 minutes after ingestion I began to feel the effects; a restlessness in the body and mind followed by a more even feeling of well-being. I then decided to smoke a joint, which helped the trip come on a little stronger and gave me a nice buzz. I was feeling pretty lazy and was almost craving some music, so I turned on &#039;An evening with John Pretricci and Jordan Rudess&#039; (which can be found at: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHXyHhngef4], and is highly recommended by me for those who enjoy music slightly more complex than that &#039;wob-wob&#039; shit that comes out now-a-days ;) Lying on my bed with headphones on in the dark let my mind explore the music on so many levels, and I just felt incredibly spiritually whole. There was a slight visual pulsing, but no real visuals to be seen, yet I wasn&#039;t disappointed by this as inside I was feeling fantastic. An hour or so later I drifted off to sleep and the next day I felt really mentally clear, although a little tired.<br /><br />After such a positive first experience I decided to try a larger dose a couple of days ago, and during the daytime. I weighed out about 2g of the shroom powder and drank it down with orange juice again. After about 20 minutes I began to feel restless again, and my stomach was churning a little. After another 20 minutes or so my head was pulsing and throbbing, my stomach nauseous, and my skin hot; I was beginning to develop a bad mental state. I felt like I was coming up too fast, and heading towards a scary trip. This was pushing my stomach over the edge, and about an hour or so after initially eating the shrooms I decided to provoke vomiting as I knew it would cause my stomach to settle afterwards. My initial plan to head outside was thwarted by my desire to curl up in bed and wait the, what I was assuming would turn into a bad trip, out. As soon as I got into my room I sat next to my window in the sunlight and immediately began to feel better. It was like the warmth of the sunlight was cleansing any bad vibes in my body, and after about 45 minutes I was properly tripping. I suddenly realized that I was feeling absolutely fine, in fact, I was better than fine, I was phenomenal. My mood was just so good, I decided to go back downstairs and go out into my garden. With a glass of water that I was slowly sipping I lay out shirtless on the green grass for around 2 hours. Everything was breathing; the grass, the trees...everything! My vision was almost like I was inside a fish bowl, with whatever I focused on coming into extreme focus. The closed-eye visuals I was getting were incredible too, they were so vivid, like I was looking through a window into a new world composed of just color, shape, vibrations and movement. I remember thinking to myself, &quot;This is a world where there is no language, just communication.&quot; Perhaps the most beneficial part of the trip for me was realizing that sometimes I need to be more decisive as a person, and that when one has two good options to choose from, they are both good choices and I would be happy with either. <br /><br />About 4 hours into the trip I noticed the effects beginning to die down, and I decided it was time to smoke a joint. I rolled a fat one, blazed it, and it brought back the shroomyness a little, but not too much. From that point on I came back to earth and contemplated my experience a little. I realized that this trip had reinstated a lot of my faith in psychedelics, their ability to help me as a whole person, and also in my day to day life. It also helped me see that my drug use is definitely a part of who I am, and I need to be careful as although I haven&#039;t had any problems with opiate-dependence (luckily), I do have a rather persistent coke habit that I want to try and kick. I saw a great deal of beauty in the world, and I hope to appreciate it more fully in the future.<br /><br />Overall, Foxcave is a legitimate, high quality seller whose powdered shrooms truly are &#039;Golden Teachers&#039;, and I will definitely be ordering again ;)<br />- JH
