				Hi Mt Gox is a secure place to start. Once purchased you have to send the chosen amount to an account you than make at Silk Road - if that&#039;s where you want to spend your &#039;moola&#039;. They all charge fees so be careful. If you are from Australia, a good cheap one at the moment is www.coinjar.io also, check out Multibit. ;)

				Yeah, Localbitcoins is becoming the easiest and cheapest way to go. I have used mt. gox, coinbase and bitinstant and they have all become to screwed up to use any more.

				i have always used bitinstint.. works flawlessly for me verytime, with the most recent being jus a couple days ago... i was skeptical at first cuz all i read bout bitinstint was bad reviews but ive had nothing but GREAT things to say bout them.. i go to wal mart and pay cash to moneygram and by the time i get back home on my computer, my funds are in my BTC wallet.. AWSOME SERVICE!!!

				I&#039;ve used localbitcoins, pretty easy to use, just transfer everything in from the wallet there to here and you are good go. Just make sure you use someone that has lots of good recent feedback. You can also fake feedback there just like here so be careful. I know a few trusted sources there if you want to know pm me.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also used JumboMonkeyBiscuit for coins. A great vendor to work with right here on SR. Coins just show up in your wallet on SR and you are set. NO fuss with waiting for the network or transferring them in. Buy your coins and go, very convenient. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				BitInstant then take it to wal-mart or walgreens. Thats the easiest/quickest way, I feel.
