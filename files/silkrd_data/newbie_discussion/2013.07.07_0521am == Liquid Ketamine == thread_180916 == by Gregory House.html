				Liquid bottles shipping, IMO, are always riskier than powder/blotter form stuff.<br />And I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s why you see less and less of those on SR : think of it as a seller, would you prefer the form with 25% refund requests or the form where 5% of your customers don&#039;t get their product ?

				Back in the 90&#039;s liquid was readily available . I would never buy pre cooked, since there is more of a chance of it being cut .
