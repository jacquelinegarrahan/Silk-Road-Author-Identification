				Looks like I&#039;m one of the first new vendors to make use of the Newbie forum for my vendor thread!<br /><br />The name&#039;s Busy Bee, and the game&#039;s chemistry! I am offering a wide range of new chemistry glassware, reagents, and textbook publisher test banks (ie. college exam answer keys). Used glassware is also in the works (will make an announcement in a week or so).<br /><br />Over the past month, I have been working out my supply chain, creating a professional seller page and listings, and making sure that my security is up to the highest standards. Finally, I&#039;m ready to open up my shop to the public - and I&#039;ve already got tons of listings up for people to browse! I am here to provide premium, professional service and&nbsp; am ready to provide a smooth, satisfying buying experience for all - from day one.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried to make everything as newbie-friendly as possible, so escrow should be open to most of you except on some particularly pricey items. :D<br /><br />★☆★SAMPLES★☆★<br /><br />Reagents: I have hydroxylamine samples up for grabs for just the cost of shipping/packaging! See my seller page for the listing!<br /><br />Test Banks: I would be happy to post up a couple of sample sections of test banks . If you are interested in a sample, post the book name and pick a chapter and I&#039;ll put some sample questions up for you!

				UPDATES:<br /><br />- I&#039;m now offering hydroxylamine samples to newbies too! All I am asking is for a short review once your order is received. You can place your order at:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4e179f35a9<br /><br />- PRICE DROPS! I&#039;ve discounted a number of chemistry supplies, and all other promotions (ex. extra 15% on all reagent orders) are still on as well. Check out my listings if you haven&#039;t already done so!

				Mr Bee,<br /><br />I have looked through your listings and I have to say your glassware is making me drool all over my keyboard! There will definitely be a time for some spare coins going your way, unfortunately, I think it will take a few weeks. Since you are a new vendor, one cannot be too sure but I would try a small purchase from you and review it properly for others! I live in northern EU, strict customs although I have had a lot of fluffy weed coming in from North America without any problems at all. <br /><br /><br />Good luck in your endeavor here on the road and never scam anyone! :)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Entity<br /><br />P.s I really, really just want glassware for academic use, I do not have any intentions to harm people with fcked up drugs - only weed!&nbsp; There are so many FUN experiments that I have done pre-labs for and other prep work, my first one being rocket fuel for a two stage rocket :). Had the reagents for it for such a long time now....

				Requesting a sample from Human Anatomy and Physiology (8e) test bank from chapter 12: The Central Nervous System.<br /><br />late edit: Thanks for the sample, the questions were too different than those in my tests so I&#039;m not going to buy the whole .pdf.

				Busy Bee,<br /><br />Sadly, although I am taking organic chem at the moment and would love to start some experimentation with chemicals I do not think I have the skill level. BUT, I do have a knack for words and I would certainly write up a review of the product you are offering for sampling. <br /><br />Give word.<br />&nbsp;

Simply purchase it as you would any other item on SR - if your account name is different than your forum name PM me here on the forum so I can confirm it&#039;s you. <br /><br />It&#039;s the same great quality product I offer in much larger quantities, but at the cost of shipping and handling alone. :) Even if you cannot test it extensively a review of my service, communication, packing/shipping, and general impressions of quality are all much appreciated.<br /><br />Protip: Creating a saturated aqueous solution of Hydroxylamine is a highly endothermic reaction - so you can at least do one basic test immediately: mix a small amount of water in with a bit of the sample and once your container gets nice and cool you know you&#039;re at least on the right track and I&#039;m not sending something inert in its place. Obviously it&#039;s not a real quantitative test by any means but absolutely something you could mention as &quot;testing&quot; in a review.

				Thank you everyone for the AMAZING response over the last day.!I&#039;ve responded to everyone&#039;s PMs and it&#039;s been great fun working with you all. I&#039;m looking forward to more messages and purchases (and hopefully reviews) as we move through February.<br /><br />NEWS:<br /><br />- Used listings will be up by the end of the weekend. Incoming: Pristine Corning Hotplate/Stirrer, large-capacity Pyrex (Made in USA) flasks, distillation equipment, large-capacity sep funnels and some new/sealed pH testing gear. All shipped FAST from Canada! If you wanna call dibs on anything before they go public get in touch ASAP!<br /><br />- Should have an answer on USA reagent shipping success by mid/late next week. Barring unforeseen circumstances, I&#039;ll open up USA ordering soon after that. I&#039;m also going to be expanding my reagent catalog at that time but will keep that under wraps &#039;till I get stock in ;)
