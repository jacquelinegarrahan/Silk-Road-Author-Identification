				Hi guys, making my first purchase soon but had a bit of a scramble somewhere in the bitcoin transfer from blockchain to sr<br />I received the money and tried sending it straight from the blockchain wallet to sr but I kept getting a insufficient funds error even though I had the funds to send. So I tried again and then it sent and my account was deducted- but then it said Unconfirmed Transaction and my sr still had no bitcoins sent to it. 10 minutes later it started saying 5 confirmed for the transaction from blockchain to sr..so Im guessing they fixed the problem ? Did I get screwed ? Does it take time for the bitcoins to reach my sr account ? <br /><br />Sorry for bombarding you guys with all these questions that I could probably search up but I tried doing a few searches for my specific situation but couldn&#039;t find anything helpful and I&#039;m a little frantic right now.<br /><br />thanks in advance for any answers

				Yes, it can take several hours for your btc to show up, and there are plenty of threads on the subject.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t receive them in 12 hours or so, send SR Support a message on the main site.

				Sending money to your blockchain wallet is practically instant in most cases, however there can be a few hour delay when sending coins to your SR account. This is totally normal. As long as you see the transaction on the blockchain you&#039;re all good. And as far as the insufficient fund notification that&#039;s because there is a very small charge every time you transfer the coins. I.E. if you only have 1.2 BTC you can only send 1.195. If that is even the fee i just know its very small.

				Some exchanges like Bitstamp will have a button to click on that will send your max amount of funds and auto-calculate their fee so you do not need to do the math yourself.
