				Hi and welcome,<br /><br />This is the NEWBIE review thread of Best Dutch Drugs and this specific review thread is for our UNMIXED SPEED / AMPHETAMINE (or the Dutch call it PEP).<br /><br />Once our current unmixed speed stock is empty we always want to restock with the same quality, but there might be times that the quality will be slightly higher or lower. Therefore the title is called 70 to 80% pure. We are positive that we can restock our speed of at least 70% pure and max. 80% pure. We always want to be honest and upfront with our products. Future reviews of all UNMIXED speed can be placed here. :D<br /><br /><br />If you have more then 50 posts post your review here, in the normal review thread located in the rumor mill section: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121834.0<br /><br /><br />We are a new vendor ready to satisfy every customer with only the highest quality Dutch drugs, we never sell inferior (lower quality) alternatives. We only sell products which we would also recommend to friends, to our customers. <br /><br /><br /><br />Currently we sell:<br /><br />✈ Very strong uncut speed (~72% pure)<br /><br />Link 5gr Strong Uncut Speed: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/65e838adf1<br /><br /><br />✈ Purple Partyflock XTC pills. (210/220mg MDMA)<br /><br />Link 5x PartyFlock XTC: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/38ddc99cd4<br /><br /><br />Whether you&#039;ve ordered a review sample from us or more, we want to know if you liked it! Trip reports are also welcome.<br /><br /><br />Feel free to judge on us shipping times/communication and everything else. Constructive criticism is also appreciated, since it improves our business. But keep in mind that we are a new vendor and we are currently very busy with starting out, our processes will get even more smooth and streamlined in the future!
