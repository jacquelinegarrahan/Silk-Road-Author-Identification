				I was wondering what peoples thoughts were on which businesses would be best to be labelled onto an envelope when it comes to international shipping. Obviously if your going to be shipping to a customer in another continent it can look a bit out of place if you are using a legitimate business envelope with a correct return addresses but still the company your sending your mail from are a car sales company, real estate, lawyers etc etc as they (postal services) might think it is strange that these companies would be sending mail internationally or to even another continent. So my question is which sorts of companies would be best to use to make things look a bit less out of place?? <br /><br />thanks a lot guys

				I don&#039;t think such a public discussion of shipping stealth is appropriate.<br />Go order a couple of items to find out and pick your own brain.<br />

				i dont think talking about what business labels to use for sending is giving any information at all to feds considering 100&#039;s of thousands of business letter are sent every day. Also it would not be revealing anything new at all. Not like im asking how people conceal things inside their packaging etc
