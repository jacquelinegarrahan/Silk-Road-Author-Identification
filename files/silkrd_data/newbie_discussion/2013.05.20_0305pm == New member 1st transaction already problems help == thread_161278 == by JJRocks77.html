				Hi guys, I opened an account on SR about a week ago and have had problems logging in the whole time. Yesterday it seemed to be working fine so I decided to try and fund my account. I made a btc purchase from a member with 100% positive feedback and over 150 transactions on SR. I was a bit nervous but I sent him £100 directly deposited to his local uk bank account this morning and then messaged him to confirm. <br /><br />He replied quickly saying he&#039;d look out for the deposit then transfer the btc. Since then I didn&#039;t hear from him for a couple hours and now the site is down? Is the site down or just not working for me? Also I&#039;m not saying I got scammed and apologies to the vendor if as I expect, everything ends up legit from his side, but I&#039;ve been reading the forums and it seems everyone is saying the bitcoin vendors are scammers.<br /><br />He sent me .01 bitcent to then make the order from him on SR, have I been scammed? Anyone know when we will be able to get back on SR market?

				It&#039;s working fine for me. Don&#039;t buy BTC from vendors on here, use Bitbargain. You also should only deal in escrow. Some reading of the buyer&#039;s guide wouldn&#039;t go a miss

				Maybe he&#039;s going to send all your bitcoins in different intervals. The site is working for me, but there is probably a large amount of people accessing it so it may be running slow. You should keep checking throughout the day to see if more bitcoins are coming in

				SR is working fine.<br /><br />Why not use https://bitbargain.co.uk or localbitcoins.co.uk<br /><br />Take&#039;s a minute to register and they work a similar escrow system as SR (so your money is safe) and you can have coins in your SR wallet within 30 mins.<br /><br />Bitbargain is my go to for coins currently.

				I agree with added sugar, I think you should limit the amount of parties that handle your bitcoins to a site that is justified as trustworthy by many other buyers. I used to use bitinstant, but I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re legit anymore.

				Unfortunately no. Next time just buy from bitinstant or localbitcoins and you will not run into this problem. In order for you to be safe you MUST be paying with bitcoins through the SR escrow system. AKA: Buying a listing that you can search in SR. You need to have the bitcoins! SR does not allow anyone to pay without bitcoins. And that is so they can get your money back if something like this happens.

				When you sign in. At the top of the page click account. The vendor did his job the right way it looks. So, he didn&#039;t scam you. But, when you went to that phishing site and typed in your pin and password. The scammers that made that fake site immediately went into your account and stole your money. If you do what I said with blockchain you may be able to see the destination account address to where they sent it. pLus, in your account section is where you can change your release funds pin and account password.

				thanks NAS, I have had good communications with the vendor who did the btc transaction and I believe he is legit, he has been fair and agreed to do a smaller transaction (below his usual min) for me to try one more time. I have changed my account details obviously and I&#039;m hoping to get a first successful SR purchase under my belt....<br /><br />Can I just ask you since you seem quite informed and helpful, I see a lot of warnings about not releasing fe, but I see a lot of the top uk-uk vendors require fe. Theyve all got great user ratings and feedback, what is your opinion on fe with highly ranked vendors on small amounts? Cheers, JJ

				Well, it&#039;s up to you. I finalized early for my first three purchases, but there are ways around it. If you do FE and something goes wrong, SR support can&#039;t help you. There have been cases, even very recently, where seemingly good vendors have gone rogue and taken the money and ran. If you would like to get your stats up, there are lotteries or even porn to buy on here, very cheap and it gets those stats up. Any amount of BTC you require can be purchased from Bitbargain, from 0.1BTC to, well, god knows what. It is much safer to do it that way. If you&#039;re paying a vendor on SR from your UK bank account, you&#039;re losing your anonymity. I know it&#039;s only BTC you&#039;re buying, but, there&#039;s ways to be more anonymous.

SR has not fault on this, it was your mistake on going into a phishing site.<br /><br />Since you are not tech savy (as you admit) I suggest you to browse well this forum for information on what you should do to behave yourself correctly on the SR (by and by, incrementing your security on steps; first learn how to use TOR and the SR, then work on anonymity etc.). You don&#039;t need to be tech-savy to learn the things, they are explained quite well so that everyone can understand them.<br /><br />Before all else NEVER use any other link to the SR but the legit address that has been given to you also here. NEVER EVER give your PIN to anybody or anywhere. SR will NEVER request your PIN, if a site does then it is a phishing site, if an individual (also masking him/herself as an admin etc.) ask for it then it is a scam individual. Also if you did the mistake on going in that false site and you did just not put your PIN there you would have not lost your money. So remember this: NEVER use your PIN outside of when you actually have to use it for an order or other transaction operations on the CORRECT SR address.<br /><br />Everybody can mistake something at beginning, it is natural. The important thing is that you learn from your errors and don&#039;t let them prevent yourself from enjoying something because of them. Yes, you lost £100, but it is not the end of the world and you will recover them in no time with your purchases. Don&#039;t let this put your off of the SR because you will lose an opportunity if you do so. Just browse the forum, inform yourself on the procedures better and then begin anew (maybe next time start a little lower on money and place one or two orders of little amounts to understand well how the things go; I can assure you that after you have placed one or two orders correctly everything will go in place and you will understand that it&#039;s not difficult at all and there are many wonderful things you can find here).<br /><br />Don&#039;t let this mistake ruin your enjoyment of the place, it was not a scam of SR to begin with, because that vendor legitly gave you the BTC you asked for.

He should obviously not be put off by the work of a thieving bastard scammer, and once he&#039;s used the site he won&#039;t make that mistake again. One can easily make the mistake he did on their first visit without visiting the forums. I only started using the forums after a vendor went AWOL, had that not happened, I still probably wouldn&#039;t. If you read this JJ, please answer my above question regarding any previous visits to the real address. Good luck with future purchases. The security here is top notch, so don&#039;t give up on the Road in favour of any lesser marketplace like Atlantis or BMR. Any problems, feel free to PM me.

				I disagree, the quality of Heroin from Holland is better than IRL, but most of the UK domestic Heroin here is of the same, or in some cases, less than I&#039;ve bought IRL. It&#039;s convenient to order online and have it delivered to your door, and safer than buying from someone on the street, so the vendors on here can charge you more for that privilege.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen Cocaine be sold for £80+ per gram IRL, and I was able to buy fantastic stuff for £50-£60 a gram locally, where I used to live. Not everything on here is of superior quality, and if you want prescription meds, £50 for one 8mg Subutex tablet is beyond a joke, they&#039;re £5 per tablet in my local area, £10 for 100mls of Methadone. The cost is higher for most things on here, not for quality, but for the convenience. I can go to a big city near to me (25 mins on the train) and get an LSD tab for £5 each. But that isn&#039;t convenient. I don&#039;t know where you reside, but if the things mentioned here are more expensive than on SR, you&#039;re getting ripped off.

				As I said, it depends where you live.<br /><br />I can assure you that where I live about 70% of the products you see here are not possible to be found to begin with the other 20% cost much more and the remaining 10% is of less quality. It all depends where you are. I have a lot of connections where I live, it is just that some products simply don&#039;t exist and are not imported here in any way. As an example good luck on finding lab grade DMT where I live, neither in 50 years probably.<br /><br />In other cases the user can have not good connections IRL or not wanting to have them and if that&#039;s so if you try to score without the connections there&#039;s an high change you will waste much money before you find them (and supposing you didn&#039;t want them to begin with you wasted money for nothing). <br /><br />I agree that I projected my personal history on the OP and for him/her it is much probably not the same (I&#039;m sure that in UK the thing is vastly different), but in my situation I can guarantee you that I saved a lot of money here and found things that it&#039;s impossible to find if you don&#039;t go outside (but in this case there is an higher risk of being caught).

				Hi guys, just checked back on the forum<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a new account just to be on the safe side, both for the forum and the main site...<br /><br />NAS, I did at some point have the legit SR link and I was stupidly using both the real link and the fake one at times throughout the week. When I used the fake one and couldn&#039;t log in I just assumed site was down and then I would google search the link and it would work. I was so stupid not to realize what was going on...<br /><br />Anyway to update my SR experience, I reordered a small amount of btc from the same vendor &#039;fromonetoanother&#039; I found him on SR just searching under money and high ranked vendors. Because I believed the first transfer came through from him legit I tried again... This vendor is legit and for me super convenient as he transfers the btc direct to my SR account without having to use the btc wallet.<br /><br />Once I received the btc I&#039;m happy to say they were not insta stolen from my account. I made a purchase from dispater, a local uk vendor with fantastic user feedback, he required fe but I decided to roll the dice as it was a small £ amount and his reviews were good. I&#039;m happy to say that the package arrived today, 24hrs after I made the order and everything is A+ solid in every way.<br /><br />So let me thank all you guys for the help and give a solid thumbs up to both vendors I&#039;ve used so far &#039;fromonetoanother&#039; and &#039;dispater&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br /><br />-JJ

				Also NAS to follow up on an earlier comment, you said I was losing my anonymity by doing a uk bank transfer to purchase the bitcoins but actually the vendor gave me a local bank acct number and sort code with no name and I was able to make an anonymous cash deposit into this account. For me the convenience of it all was worth the small markup.

				If it&#039;s Heroin you&#039;re after, and from UK, join our other thread&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155937.msg1091033#msg1091033<br /><br />It&#039;s specific to your needs. Didn&#039;t you have to use your own bank details for the transfer? Trust us who&#039;ve said it, look up Bitbargain, it takes about 2 mins to get your coins. Just because this vendor hasn&#039;t ripped you off yet, doesn&#039;t mean he won&#039;t in the future when/if you decide to move more money around. Vendors go rogue all the time on here. I&#039;m only looking out for another Silk Road brother. I received an order from Dispater too today. You&#039;ll be in good company on the thread I mentioned above. We&#039;re a good bunch who keep each other informed specifically on UK/EU Heroin. There&#039;s some lovely folk on there, last week one nice chap, Japan1980, lent one of us who was ill 0.40BTC so he could get some gear for the next day. I can only ask you so many times to be safe and not get your BTC from the road, feedback can be faked, respected vendors can turn nasty overnight, never FE if you can avoid it. Good luck bro.

				yes NAS that is what I purchased, I did not use a bank transfer to buy the coins, I simply went to the local branch, put the account info on a deposit slip with no name and made a cash deposit. I don&#039;t actually have a working uk bank account which makes using bitbargain impossible for me right now. I&#039;ll just keep my btc purchses at £100 per time and if the guy goes rogue then I can only get fucked for a few quid. Will jump in on your thread, cheers mate

				I don&#039;t get why everyone is so anti buying btc from sr vendors...<br /><br />Its more convenient in that I can purchase with anonymous cash deposits into local bank and the btc goes directly into my sr account instead of dealing with the whole bitwallet thing. As I mentioned before I&#039;m not very computer savvy. What are the hidden costs? The vendor charges 15% on top of the price from MTxgov which he clearly states in his product page. I can&#039;t buy from bitbargain as I don&#039;t use a checking account I cant do wire transfers.

				You don&#039;t really need your own wallet on your hard drive, if you buy from Bitbargain you can send the coins straight to your Silk Road wallet. People like to &quot;clean&quot; the coins by bouncing them around to different wallets, there&#039;s an anonymous wallet site called Bitcoin Fog. How do you get paid if you don&#039;t have a bank account?

				This thread is definitely important for people to read. There is the stickied thread warning about phishing scams, but with more threads, there&#039;s more chance others will read it. These thieves really piss me off. Luckily, I didn&#039;t come across any phishing sites when I was a n00b. Luckily I&#039;ve read many times that &quot;neither Silk Road, nor its staff or admins, will ask you for your pin, ever&quot; It&#039;s a shame that people find the phishing site before they find those words. The site is so convincing, and the highlighted help button next to the field for entering your pin looks and reads convincing too. New members, study the buyers guides, read the wiki page, visit the forums! That should be written in bold, neon writing ten foot high everywhere! (Impractical, obviously!)
