				I tried purchasing an O from MsBliss, but of course as soon as I get bitcoins into my SR account, MsBliss no longer has any listings... I put in $200 USD into my account, but now I dont know what to buy?&nbsp; I want to get molly but Im going to CAMP BISCO and I wont be back until Sunday.&nbsp; I def want to buy more than $300 worth of MDMA so Im going to wait til I return to buy with patience on doing research on who to buy.&nbsp; So considering bitcoins fluctuate so much, what should I do with my bitcoins?&nbsp; I was thinking putting them in Blockchain but isnt that the same as leaving it in my SR wallet?&nbsp; Well tech now I only have $196 cuz bitcoins went down....

				Send them to me for safe keeping? ;D<br /><br />But seriously, I&#039;d recommend just holding onto them for the time being. It&#039;s probably safe to keep them in your SR wallet but I&#039;d go with blockchain. Some people are predicting a coming fall in the value of btc but imo this is just a rumor initially spread to influence mass psychology into a selloff which would place a high amount of value in a few hands of investors most likely. They&#039;ll likely rise back up as time progresses, just keep your eyes open and if you feel uncomfortable then maybe cash out or buy something on here. There are plenty of people looking to buy btc and plenty of great listings :)
