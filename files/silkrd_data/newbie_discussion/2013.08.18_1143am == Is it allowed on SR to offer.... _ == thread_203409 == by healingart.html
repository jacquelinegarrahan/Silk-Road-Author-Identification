				Hello, Im new to the community but would like offer something that is has great value. I do host ceremonys for healing with Ayahuasca or mushrooms in europe and would like to put these offers in here... But I dont know if that is allowed since this is nothing that can&nbsp; be shipped :D<br />These events are in different location and last for 1 or 2 nights. I would like to know you opinion. Possible or not?<br /><br />believe me these one can benefit a lot of people since I have extensive experience and can do healing with it. <br /><br />peace

				Hi man, i don&#039;t know if your product could be proposed here in SR. Anyway, honestly I think that someone would be worried to call you (a random guy in internet) to organize a cerimony based on mescaline and psilocybin. I think that it&#039;s a crazy idea but everybody try to create their own business and you just had a fucking strange but innovative idea. Best luck man&nbsp; ;D

				Not that crazy of course there would be a review based site involved and testimonies as well as much more informations about the whole ceremony.<br /><br />Maybe someone knows if its Ok to offer that.

				You can offer anything that doesn&#039;t harm others. It sounds great, but maybe you can just plan a place and time and make it like you are advertising a festival. They can pay when they get there or you can sell admittion on SR but you have to know how to identify your buyers when they arrive (a one-time use password?).<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Mdozi
