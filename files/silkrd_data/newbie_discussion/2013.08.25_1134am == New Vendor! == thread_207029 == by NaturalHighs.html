				G&#039;day folks<br /><br />Natural Highs is a brand new Australian Silkroad vendor seeking to distribute marijuana online. We have only just made our account viewable today, just wondering if anyone has any tips for attracting the first customers. All input will be discussed and considered.<br /><br />Cheers guys<br />:D

				The best thing to do is advertise heavily that you&#039;re domestic in AU (there&#039;s been lots of customs mishaps lately, so domestic vendors have a huge opportunity here), and if stock permits, do an &quot;introductory sale&quot; for something like a gram so people can sample your buds and come back for more if they&#039;d like.<br /><br />Some other things, <br /><br />stick around on the forum and become a known and trusted member<br /><br />never require people to finalize early, even with new accounts<br /><br />always use the latest shipping techniques such as moisture barrier bags, mylar, etc <br /><br />be friendly with your customers, and try to answer any questions they throw at you<br /><br />encourage customers to encrypt their address with PGP<br /><br />Hopefully this gives you some ideas :)

				A few suggestions: Get busy posting in the forums so you can reach fifty posts and then be able to advertise on the Products Offered board and also create a review thread on the Rumor Mill board. Link your forum review thread to your vendor page. Consider, also, creating a review thread in the Newbie Discussion section so folks with less than fifty posts can review your product/service.<br /><br />Check your SR account frequently for new messages and respond promptly. Make sure you are actually addressing the question or concern voiced in the message when you respond. If someone just writes to say hi or offer a compliment, respond and say thank you! Many people will probably message you asking for free samples and promising all kinds of things like positive reviews and future huge orders. Ignore these or respond with polite refusals or go ahead and send them free stuff, just don&#039;t be disappointed if they fail to fulfill whatever promises they made.<br /><br />Ship orders right away! I think the biggest complaint from buyers is slow shipping. If you can afford to include some bonus product with your early orders, do so by all means, but get the orders in the mail fast and your buyers will be happy.<br /><br />Best wishes and much success,<br /><br />-PtC

				Noice getting paid. Best of luck sir. Also always make sure that none of the residue ever touches the outside of the bags. Sniffers can pick up on that. Seems to always be the biggest mistake.
