				Hello Silk Road.<br />I am a lover of my weed, and I love knowing that others are having the same love with their joint as I am with mine.For this reason I have been contemplating about becoming a vendor on here.All A and B grade smoke will of been grown and tested by me or a close trusted friend,and if I don&#039;t like it I wont sell it.I never sell what I wouldn&#039;t buy.<br />Listings wouldn&#039;t be the biggest,1,2,3g&#039;s etc.However they would be of a fair price.I have noticed some of the prices on SR and with respect and with not naming the vendors the prices are shocking.They would be listed as Commercial,B,A or A+ grade.<br />Any thoughts from UK customers would be appreciated,would like to guage the kind of interest on here for weed sold with love for a pretty fair price!<br />Of course if in a week or two I decide to start my venture down the road,I&#039;ll be giving out a few samples,if interested in being a potential customer just drop your name on here and a few of you will receive an invite to a free sample listing.<br /><br />I like being high.<br />Come fly with me brothers and sisters!

				Any UK vendor who has good weed at decent and reasonable prices is bound to do well. As such a vendor is rare, you should get a lot of interest, providing the goods are nice enough.

				Good to see there has been a bit of interest :)<br />As I said already,all A and B grade stuff will be grown by me or a very trusted friend.I will be trying to spread the love by keeping prices pretty fair.I&#039;m chopping a crop up as we speak.GDPxBuddha.Smells pretty darn fine.Definately B or A,but cant say until ive smoked it.If I see a Commerical grade that I will personally smoke,I don&#039;t mind sharing the love on that too.<br />Sample requests have been noted!Lets see how many more would be interested in a new UK weed vendor.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DOES ANYONE LIKE ME LOVE GDP!?!?<br /><br />Unless it&#039;s a big big item I can&#039;t understand how vendors can charge rates like 8 quid to post a small jiffy bags with a couple of grams of weed in it.That to me is just a dumb kind of stealth tax.I&#039;ll be charging around the 0.1-0.15btc range for ship.And I wont be doing none of this £25 a gram crap that some pull off on there.It&#039;s all about smoke for a pretty fair price.We should be at one with each other for our love of the bud,not try fucking each other over!<br /><br />Just a bit worried I&#039;ll pay the fees,join up and get no custom.Thats a good way to waste a lot of money!<br />More customers about ? :D<br />Get high! Come fly!

				I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a way around it for vendors, but I suggest getting 50 posts so you can start your own thread in the rumor mill. There will be a lot more potential customers to be found there, as this board is mostly just spam last time I checked.<br /><br />Once you have a few samples out, and reviews of them come in, this can all be put into your feedback thread, and if you then list nice weed at decent prices, then I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll build up a nice customer base. There&#039;s definitely a place for fairly priced weed in the UK market on here, so I wouldn&#039;t worry too much as long as you&#039;re confident in your product. A lot of people resort to importing due to (I imagine) UK prices and overseas vendors often having better products, so anyone who can save people the risk of international orders would be welcome.

				Glad to hear interest from a U.K grower who grows with Love - the difference is very noticeable !&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Sounds like you&#039;ve done your ground work &amp; require some reassurance before you make the &#039;Leap&#039;.<br />&nbsp;I would say if you feel you have the time &amp; desire to Vend on SR then pls ensure you can afford to lose the Vendor Fee, should the venture not pan out. Either way, you could sell the Vendor account.<br /><br />I wish you all the best &amp; hope to sample your bud&#039;s someday !<br /><br />Longpath

				there&#039;s been a few new uk weed vendors recently and i won&#039;t order with them because they&#039;re pricing at the same level as established vendors yet haven&#039;t done anything to prove themselves. if it was me i&#039;d undercut the more popular vendors to start off with them gradually raise the price in line with your feedback rep. i know this isn&#039;t your typical small business but they say most will lose money while starting out. make sure you get your packaging method secure right from the start as people tend to judge on that almost as much as the quality of product. <br />and i&#039;ll take a sample for a review if you do decide to start up, i&#039;d be happy to cover postage too :) <br />i&#039;d suggest growing some rarer new strains that aren&#039;t as readily available in the uk, we got enough white widow and cheese already. end of the day as long as you don&#039;t price like NSNS and treat your customers like crap people will definitely buy from you.

				More replies!Hurray!<br />I see a lot of people asking for 1g for £10....as it stands,a grade B or A would sit at around (CURRENT rate 1btc = £16) 0.75-0.85btc per gram, with a quid postage on top(some of the bigger orders will be freepost). Commercial grade from would be around 0.65-0.70 when I have some,as I said before I wouldn&#039;t sell what I wouldn&#039;t smoke.<br />From what I can see on SR,nobody is listing at that price.I&#039;m not saying they are ripping people off,they have their own values and opinions and I respect them and their customers,I just personally believe a little less change in the pocket is worth knowing you&#039;ve made someone smile when they have a joint :D I also did a test last month as a customer on here sampling a few of the UK weed products.One which was supposed to be a decent grade was commercial(just),another I bought under the assumption that it was pretty good smoke and all I could do was just feel pity for the vendor who could do over fellow smoke lovers like this.I think the market situation in the UK has meant a lower quality weed all over in general,which in turn newer smokers aren&#039;t getting the chance to appreciate a decent bit of smoke. Remember, the half a joints that would make you sit there and think &#039;&#039;Hell yeah!&#039;&#039; Even on the streets,not all sellers are bad but some just sell absolute crap and people buy it!Does anyone remember the quality of the smoke 5 years ago compared to what it is now!?<br />That changes here.Next week I&#039;ll be making the decision.If people like the price above,then LOVE could be possibly coming to the UK on SR!<br /><br />As Buzz Lightyear says<br />&#039;&#039;Reach for the sky!!&#039;&#039;<br />Come fly!<br /><br />Remember,decision next week brothers and sisters of weed appreciation!

				As long as the bud you&#039;re offering is truly special, and ideally exotic to UK shores, the prices you&#039;ve quoted seem fair and should attract plenty of buyers.

				It&#039;d be great to have another decently priced UK vendor selling good quality weed. It seems like you put a lot of time and care into your grows, and it sounds like you have some really nice bud. Hopefully you can get some samples out (I don&#039;t mind paying) so I can write you a review :) The only shame is that you only have a couple of plants, so once we&#039;ve smoked all your supply we&#039;ll be waiting a few weeks for the next batch! :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120099.msg818643#msg818643">Quote from: come_flywithme on February 12, 2013, 07:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I just personally believe a little less change in the pocket is worth knowing you&#039;ve made someone smile when they have a joint :D <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Love this statement.

				If you can provide decent green for £10 a gram you will have no shortage of customers.&nbsp; I usually order international but its a gamble with customs.&nbsp; Had a handwritten jiffy bag with a netherlands postmark last time and the thing stank of bananas, cant believe it got through. <br /><br />Anyway, get 50 posts and make a thread in the Rumour Mill for reviews.&nbsp; Much more traffic in that forum.&nbsp; Good luck!

				Hello.<br /><br />As a UK user who&#039;s new to SR (and gradually learning how to use it), I&#039;m keen to find UK vendors who provide quality goods for quality prices - this seems to be one of them, judging from the positive response.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be keeping in touch with this thread. <br />
