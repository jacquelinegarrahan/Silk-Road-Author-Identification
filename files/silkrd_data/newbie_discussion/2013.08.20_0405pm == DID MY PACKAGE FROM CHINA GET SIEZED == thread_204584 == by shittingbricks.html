				&nbsp;I have a package coming from china that says it was being processed in the city next to me then it departed the processing center, just to say its being processed at the same post office again. So to make it simple it says<br /><br />processing at (city a)&nbsp; day 3<br />depart from (city a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;day 3<br />processing at (city a)&nbsp; day 4 (for a second time)<br /><br />so basically my main concern is why is my packaging being processed at the same post office twice? <br />Is something like this normal with international mail?<br />Also (city a) is about a 30 min drive from my destination so i assumed that I should have received my package on day 4, but instead it is being processed for a second time.<br /><br />Any help will be much appreciated<br /><br />

Why did it return to (City A) instead of going to (City B) which is right next to (city a)<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been seeing lots of users saying their package from China got seized, it&#039;s probably best to avoid ordering anything from it for a while. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t look like your package got detected, but still take all necessary precautions, for example don&#039;t get the mail immediately, don&#039;t leave the house, write RETURN TO SENDER in all capitals on the front, and if you get a knock at your door, remember your rights.
