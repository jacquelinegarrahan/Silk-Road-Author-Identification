				New member here with a newbie question (hey we were all newbies at one point). My question is can I use localbitcoins to transfer btc to SR directly? I&#039;ve read that localbitcoins also serves as a wallet, so does this mean I can transfer it direction to my SR account? I&#039;m not really sure how that process works exactly but I want to know how everything works making payments and such before I put money into getting btc. Thanks!<br /><br />also should add that I&#039;m weary about putting personal information into websites such as dwolla, or instantbtc and definitely won&#039;t be doing that, better safe than sorry..

				Yes, you sure can. Just enter your SR wallet code on localbitcoins, and send it.

				Awesome:) This means I need no middleman or any other websites to transfer between? I&#039;ve seen on the forums people using like 3-5 websites they transfer through

				Yeah along the lines of what DV82 was saying, I&#039;ve read that having a password encrypted wallet is the way to go. I read post of LE showing up at someones door when I believe it was bitinstant gave their personal information to the fuzz. I&#039;m not sure how much personal information localbitcoins requires, but though I&#039;d give my $.02<br />On the SR homepage, there is a link called &quot;Try tails for a more sercure OS,&quot; which details setting up a portable secure OS, and also in the post, there is also information on how to set up your own, password verified wallet. There is discussion on the benefits of TAILS and encrypted wallets under the post as well.<br />Good luck, stay up&nbsp; :)
