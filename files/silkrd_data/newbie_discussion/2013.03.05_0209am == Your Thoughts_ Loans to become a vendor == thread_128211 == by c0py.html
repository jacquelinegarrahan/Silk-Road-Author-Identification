				Hey mate,<br />I took out a &#039;loan&#039; of sorts and SR costs more than you expect and is a little slower than you expect so a few points:<br /><br />1) Don&#039;t loan from someone that&#039;ll kick your head in if you&#039;re late<br />2) Don&#039;t loan from the bank as theyll find out what it was for<br />3) Don&#039;t use a payday loan as it might not get a return by the time they expect money<br /><br />SO<br /><br />Only take a loan from a friend or relative...<br /><br />Be smart drug debt is always bad!

				Crafty call on the bank loan there mate though I&#039;m in the UK and I have to say they&#039;re a little harsher on the checks. Not saying you&#039;re wrong at all like! It obv worked for you. But I stick by that its a bad idea going via a bank. For starters, how do you explain the constant MtGox deposits hehehe (jk)

				Seems like a terrible idea. If you can&#039;t afford the startup cash what are you gonna do if a shipment is lost early?
