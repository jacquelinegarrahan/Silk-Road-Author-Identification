				I have a hypothetical situation I could use some hypothetical help on.<br /><br />If there was a person who had a court date assigned to him, but held no flight risk, so they let him go on with his life, work his daily job and do whatever else, until the day of his trial. <br /><br />Now lets say that person were to decide to go on vacation via the train. How likely would it be that the police would be waiting for him when he got off to arrest him and bring him back home. Because they would assume that he was fleeing. Even though he was only legitimately&nbsp; going on vacation.<br /><br />What do you guys think would happen?

				Is the trip out of the country? Are their any conditions set on the person being free (ie is he not supposed to leave the state)? If the person is really going on a legitimate vacation, it would be best to just let the courts know. In most cases they&#039;ll just grant the trip on the condition that you return in time for the court date, and can get you a waiver for travel if necessary. In general they don&#039;t really care what you do while you&#039;re out, as long as its legal and as long as you show up at the time you&#039;re expected.

				I wouldnt expect it, if you want to avoid it for sure just &quot;hypothetically&quot; try buying the train ticket with cash at the station.

				I&#039;d agree with Lorimer here.<br /><br />I really wouldn&#039;t expect any LEO to be waiting for you, though obviously thats a bit different if you&#039;re leaving the state or crossing borders or something.

				I wouldn&#039;t expect any problems unless the hypothetical situation was a HUGE charge, in which case, the person would probably be considered a flight risk anyways.

				It all depends on the charges you have, I doubt it&#039;s a Murder or rape, as you probably would not have got bail. It may be worth going to court? probation and suspended sentences are common place these days. <br />If you have your mind made up and want to live free, believe it or not doing some research will pay off&nbsp; major. Guides to living free as basic guidelines but seriously do your own research.<br />now if the condition are not to leave the country, you&#039;ll have some issues maybe such as computer systems at airports etc, but if your getting the train customs etc is minimal. <br /><br />it is unlikely they would set all this up for just you alone. Unless as i said it is a serious charge. However they could post a sort of &quot;keep an eye out&quot; type thing to all officers, So hats etc maybe a bonus.<br />just dont look shady at all, act completely normal. Smile at police officers or look at them and make a point of yawning etc as if your not bothered at all. it should register in their subconscious as this guy isn&#039;t a threat or suspicious. <br /><br />As somebody else said, apply for permission to go on holiday, and from wherever you go just border jump from there. Then your last known location would be say for instance&quot;france&quot; where you proceeded to cross into a different country, And then they lost track of you. And from there change again at least once more to make sure your in the clear. But as someone else said, You cannot get caught &quot;as yourself&quot; again, you will get FUCKED. And it dont matter where you are, you dont wanna be a foreginer in a jail. <br /><br />Once you get to a different country, where you want to stay, do the basic, dye your hair, pay with cash, dont act big or stupid, just be the grey man, do not stand out, do blend in.<br />You can say you have no id as it was stolen, get a library card with a fake name, Then rent a house/room cash, with a fake name and ask for a signed bill or receipt or something. Then get a bill sent to your house or even a magazine subscription for 1 issue. headed paper with your fake name and address on it. electrical bills etc help a lot. Maybe go to a lawyer for a free consultation and get him to draw you up some sort of plan for as cheap as possible, say you want a bill sent to you. Im sure you see a pattern here. <br />anyways once you get as many things as you can, try and get more &quot;substantial&quot; documents, Hopefully you will attempt this in a leniant country where there are much less restrictions, (Look at mexico compared to the US.) Once you have as much as you can, switch countrys again, And use the more substantial documents to build on it again, anyway by now you are on the system as a new person, With as much proof as you can that you are who you say you are . This is pretty basic, Just use some common sense. <br /><br />think long and hard about it, Is one year or so in jail maybe3-5 worth the rest of your life on the run, Not being able to return to where your from? Who knows only you can decide. <br /><br />i wish you luck on your endeavours friend. keep us updated ;)

				Lets add another, hypothetical layer. <br /><br />Lets say this person were to have complete fake documentation. Drivers License, passport, birth certificate, utility bills, etc... <br />And he had bought the ticket with a credit card he had managed to open with the fake name that matches the documents, so he now had tickets for the train under this fake name. Would he be untouchable?<br />Again, he is returning this is really vacation. He is staying within his country, and not fleeing whatsoever.<br /><br />He would hypothetically rather a 5 year sentence, then running for the rest of his life.

				if this is in the US it will say on the bond papers..if it is a misdemeanor there is no travel limitations within the country if it is a felony you still shouldnt have any trouble as long as you show up for court..of course if your friend was put on pre-trial probation this is completely different..
