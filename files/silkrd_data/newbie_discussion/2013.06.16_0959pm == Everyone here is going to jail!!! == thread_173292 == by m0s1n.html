				this pisses me off. here i am minding my own fucking business, being smart, holding down a job to keep my house and all the finer things in life that ive come to enjoy, and then comes along some crackhead that didnt get busted by the cops but by his own crackhead mother dimed out on him. Now i dont know what kind of worthless piece of shit you have to be to get your own crackhead mother to to flip on you, but thats not my fault! Now he&#039;s in jail telling them everything about everyone here and now i have to go to jail too. thats fucked up man. thats really fucked up<br /><br /><br />...oh wait. the cops already know about sr and read everything on here and have been for years and years... i think im good
