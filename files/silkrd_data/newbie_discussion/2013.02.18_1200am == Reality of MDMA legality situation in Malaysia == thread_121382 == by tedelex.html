				I&#039;m not sure this is the correct section to get a good response but it&#039;s the only place I can post for now.<br /><br />A buddy and I are going to Malaysia in a few weeks for a big music event and I&#039;ve heard/read mixed things about drug use and culture over there. I&#039;ve read online in &#039;official&#039; places that drug laws are strict, but others have said that personal use is not targeted, only import/export. I completely understand that any advice given has to be taken with a huge pinch of salt, but has anyone been there and if so: what is the drug culture like over there (particularly surrounding music festivals) and would you recommend using anything? I don&#039;t mind the idea of going sober but some molly is always nice.<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance

				I&#039;ve was in Malaysia many years ago, went there from Thailand kicking a heavy No.4 habit. Like everywhere in the world, there&#039;s a drug scene. I smoked opium with some old Chinese guys in the Highlands, one of whom gave me a bag of this green herbal stuff for my w/d&#039;s, which only years later I realised was kratom, and I smoked a straw of weed with an Indian guy I stayed with in KL......which definitely counts as the most paranoid joints I ever puffed in my life.<br /><br />Personally I would advise either to avoid drug use in Malaysia, or employ extreme caution. If you&#039;re gut instinct says no, then don&#039;t go ahead. Bribing Malaysian cops would be even harder than their Thai counterparts, who have learned that Westerners can sometimes payout the jackpot.<br /><br />The problem with the SE Asian countries is that in order to curry favour with the US Overlords in the War Against Drug Users, they have enacted sadistically harsh punishments for drugs offences, which in Malaysia and Singapore can and do involve the death sentence for what would be small to middle sized amounts back home, [including cannabis]. <br /><br />Also, Singapore flaunts its savagery against drug users as a fig leaf for its total immersion in laundering the proceeds from the Burmese regime&#039;s drug production. All those countries also know that a Westerner facing double figures in one of their hell-hole jails, or death, may turn out to be a very valuable diplomatic bargaining chip if public opinion back home demands the government &quot;do something&quot;. <br /><br />Personally my advice to anyone visiting Malaysia or Singapore is to avoid drugs unless you are in with some very knowledgeable locals, and even then be extra cautious.

				razyour, I understand 100% what you&#039;re saying....every country has a drug scene, and you are part of it over there. You know how it moves, what to do, where to go, &amp; who to avoid.<br /><br />What I&#039;m saying is that for a foreigner who goes to SE Asia, and DOESN&#039;T know the scene, they are very likely to fuck up, and if you fuck up with drugs in Asia, it can get very serious, very quickly. Asian governments love hauling a foreigner into court on drugs charges to PROVE they are DOING SOMETHING in this ongoing war against bodily freedom.<br /><br />As a local over there, you also know when its time to back off &amp; leave the scene for a while, to avoid one of the periodic crackdowns &amp; mass arrests which happen of local drug users, again to demonstrate that SOMETHING IS BEING DONE.<br /><br />Anyway, glad to hear you are keeping the spirit alive in Malaysia, long may it continue! Fuck prohibition sideways with a broken bottle, and may the gods of chaos bring only misery &amp; failure to every drug cop, big and small. Curse them, curse them, curse them!

Most people on the club scene do it. There was always raids, and they&#039;d test you, but you could easily pay your way out. one tip for foreigners :OFFER MONEY, DON&#039;T CALL THE PRESS. GET A RICH LAWYER THAT HAS CONNECTIONS TO THE COURT. MONEY RULES IN MALAYSIA. .. I was only 19 and witnessed all of this shit, taking ecstasy on friday, saturday and sometimes sunday night over a period of 6 months. then shit fell apart, people got arrested, parents banished us out of the country and some of us are still fuckups living off our parents. i&#039;m ashamed of what i did to myself. but, i have plenty of stories to tell. thats malaysia for you. the forbidden fruit is soooo damn sweet. and spoilt generation y and x are draining the baby boomers out of their life savings.<br />
