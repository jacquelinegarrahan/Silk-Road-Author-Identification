				Title: <strong>Coinbase</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				So, I ordered 1.20 bitcoins last Friday (the 6th) and was promised a delivery time by Coinbase for today, Thursday the 12th, at 3:30.<br /><br />I was pumped as hell. I&#039;ve been picking all the stuff I was gonna get on SR. I&#039;ve NEVER purchased on SR before, but I&#039;ve been studying it for months and finally decided I&#039;m ready (learned PGP, learned how to be safe, etc). I&#039;ve done nothing but OBSESS over waiting for those bitcoins...<br /><br />And then, of course, they cancelled my order AT THE VERY LAST FUCKING SECOND! They said it was a &quot;high risk&quot; transaction.<br /><br />The only reason I can think of for them to do that is that the coin is worth about 11 more dollars than is was last Friday and they just didn&#039;t want to lose that 11 bucks. I honestly can&#039;t think of any other reason. Sure, I&#039;m a new customer with no reason to be trusted (other than verifying my identity, giving them my cell phone number and verifying my bank account).<br /><br />I&#039;m so angry it hurts. I had it all planned out. I was going to transfer them about now (when I was promised them) to my SR address, wait the time it took to transfer, then FINALLY get to use SR! <br /><br />I even got my .001g scale in today from Amazon.<br /><br />I WAS READY! haha<br /><br />So, does anyone want to recommend a bitcoin site to me? One that is REALLY quick, not one of those deposit your cash into some bank, something I can do online quickly and efficiently?

				Just use localbitcoins. There&#039;s a multitude of different methods you can use from them, from an actual meeting with a local person, I&#039;ve never done this, to moneygram, bank deposits, paypal , western union, etc, etc, etc. I like the moneygram option and can have the BTC&#039;s in my localbitcoin wallet in literally minutes from when I start the transaction. That speedy part of course depends on choosing a vendor that works fast.&nbsp; Localbitcoins even uses escrow , just like the Road for your protection. I could make an order now and have the BTC&#039;sa in 20 minutes. That , of course doesn&#039;t mean BTC&#039;s in my SR account, you still have to do that transfer, but that usually only takes bout an hour or 2. Sometimes longer but there&#039;s nothing to be done about that part.

If your in the USA, you pretty much can&#039;t swing a dead cat without hitting a CVS or Walmart. Is it security reasons keeping you from physically going into a moneygram branch, are you worried about a camera catching you or something like that?? If that is your reasoning, don&#039;t worry about it, in MG&#039;s eyes your only either sending $$$ to someone or your paying a bill, depends on how the vendor has it set up. I&#039;ve had excellent luck using the vendor quickcoin on localbitcoins.com. But, there are plenty just as fast and reliable as he is. <br />Hope it works out for ya Brutha

				I used to use coinbase! you got flagged for 1.2BTC. I got flagged for buying between $200-450 worth of BTC for a few weeks. I disputed the cancelled BTCs with them and got them to whitelist my account. <br />Then I had an epiphany: they know im buying BITCOINS and they stopped me, I wonder who I was reported too. Be careful using Coinbase, dont get sucked in by there quick turnaround times and eas of use! <br />Just hit up some vendors on the road for WU or Moneygram

				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;d like to work with you going forward and I can offer a great rate, very easy transitions with btc, and be your trusted provider. I deal with either WU(more fees involved), or cash deposits at either Bank of America, BB&amp;T, or Chase account. All you need to do is post a cash deposit to the account I provide via email, email me your deposit receipt, and I&#039;ll send coins very quickly! We can arrange a good time so that as soon as you send me the deposit receipt, I&#039;ll be standing by and will send the coins at that very price of btc of the receipt. Trust me, we can start with small transactions - I am a vendor and am looking to help my fellow bitcoin aficionados achieve their needs and wants long term!! I&#039;m not trying to jack up my rep for a couple hundred bucks...<br />I am a professional and have been dealing personally and professionally in btc for a while now. <br />My ideal situation is to work with you and build my rep on here (specifically) as a vendor. <br />Also, I&#039;m willing to offer a lower rate than I usually do, and in turn, you can give me a shout out on here and any referrals I get from you, I&#039;ll be happy to discount your rate even more. <br />Hit me up via email if you&#039;d like to work together: libertycoin@sefe-mail.net and let me know if you prefer PGP.

				No, I agree and understand your stance completely. I&#039;ve been scammed too on here, actually and it was for a measly 100 bucks...so I decided to do something about it. I do actually have a localbitcoin account set up that I&#039;ve used a while back, but I am currently looking to forgo that extra step, as I can assure an honest transaction. As we know, word of mouth is gold on here and that&#039;s the type of reputation I&#039;m looking to gain. If I can get you the best price (or very close to) with a quick transition, and with the utmost availability of coins, there&#039;s no reason anyone should hesitate.

				So and update about my coinbase account. I received a message from them today:<br /><br /><br />-------------------------------<br />&quot;Hi,<br /><br />Sorry about that! After manually reviewing your account I&#039;ve whitelisted it so you shouldn&#039;t experience any additional issues going forward. I&#039;ve also pushed through the transaction that was canceled previously (at the original exchange rate you locked in), so you should have those coins soon.<br /><br />Hope it helps and sorry again for the trouble!&quot;<br />-------------------------------<br /><br /><br />I honestly didn&#039;t expect that. In fact, I didn&#039;t expect it so much that I bought 1 BTC from btQuick today (PHENOMENALLY QUICK, BUT PRICEY AS ALL FUCK! 7% fee). It even took less than 5 mins for me to get it in my SR account.<br /><br />haha, thing is. I guess I messed up a symbol or capitalization when writing my pin. So, when trying to check out with a particular vendor, I ended up getting my pin locked until Monday. So, I promptly changed my SR passphrase in case my account had been compromised and some one else had changed my pin (one reason, while unlikely, why I couldn&#039;t get to work) and now I&#039;m just gonna wait it out until Monday for those coins. Damnit. haha.<br /><br />Fortunately, thanks to Coinbase, I&#039;ll hopefully have 1.20 a little later tonight (was promised a certain time, it&#039;s now two hours later) but we&#039;ll see how it goes. Thinking about setting up another SR account and using those particular coins this weekend...even though things will not ship until Monday, anyway.<br /><br />So...it&#039;s been a crazy ride in obtaining my first coins...Spent way more than I intended, but maybe here soon I&#039;ll be posting about drug quality, and not bitching about buying bitcoins.<br /><br />Speaking of drug quality, anyone wanna suggest meth, heroin, or benzo (any kind) vendors to a guy that&#039;s never made a purchase on SR?<br /><br />
