				Hey guys!<br /><br />I made an order with SuperTrips on Monday evening and its still processing.<br />Is it normal for SuperTrips to take that long to ship things? Does anybody have any experience with this vendor?<br /><br />cheers!

				I am in the same boat. <br /><br />He is probs just busy. I am sure he will get it out soon. I know it can get annoying when you have had an order just sitting there for a days.

				His order is marked as processing so finalize option not even active yet.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think he is a scammer. He looks like one of the highest volume vendors on the Road. Will know for sure soon enough.

				ST is not a scammer... I literally had an order come in from him that took two days! I live across the pond SE too.. postage was marked 5/13 and I got it 5/15 no bullshit... fastest time ever from Germany and I have ordered a lot from there... He is known for marking it in transit and then sending it a few days later as I could tell by the postage and my past experience but with 2 day shipping I could care less... honestly wasn&#039;t expecting the pack for 2-3 weeks!

				goddamn it. sorry for bumping this thread but...<br />I placed my order MONDAY evening, it took him ~3 days until fucking FRIDAY morning to &quot;ship it&quot;. And I wasn&#039;t asked to but I FE&#039;d just so I would get my shit asap. (Is it normal for him that he won&#039;t send you a message asking you to FE? I know a lot of other vendors do....eh.. hopefully I didn&#039;t do anything wrong here) ANYWAY so it says on his profile &quot;Your order will be dispatched within 6 hours after your order has been confirmed&quot; and if that were the case I would have my package RIGHT NOW but I DON&#039;T. There&#039;s no worse feeling of disappointment when you go to your postbox and you open it and.....THERES NOTHING INSIDE.<br /><br />But ok. Anyway, the thing that really sucks now is that its fucking Saturday and next Monday OF COURSE has to be a stupid HOLIDAY. Damn Christians, now I&#039;ll have to wait at least 2 more days... I&#039;m not a patient person.<br />I&#039;m not blaming SuperTrips or anything I guess his processing and shipping times are still decent or fast even but why is it that I always have this kind of bad luck? Not only are my packages NEVER here before the fucking weekend starts, no matter when I place my order, NO, there always have to be pointless stupid holidays all the time. UGH<br />Ok sorry, just had to vent a bit cause I really looked forward to a great weekend... Oh well. Now I&#039;ll have to bear being fully conscious and perceiving everything as it really is: shitty<br /><br />anyway, I hope you guys have a nice weekend! take care<br /><br />And sorry for the caps..

				Your package will come. You will get used to the lag times, take it on the chin and just to try and plan a better in future. ps if i am not mistaken this is another weekend next week ;)<br /><br />He probs asked you to FE if your buying stats are poor or non-existant. <br /><br />ST appears to be one of the roads busiest vendors, I am sure he would love to turn round his orders much quicker as well as that would mean more moolah for him.<br /><br /><br />

				Super Trips is a long standing back bone of the SR community. That being said, it is normal to wait a little while for order to process. Further more it is normal for post to take 10-21 days from EU to US.

				Yea you&#039;re probably right, lol. Waiting just really isn&#039;t my thing, sorry again. And yea, at least now I know it and now I&#039;ll be able to plan better, thats true. Gathering experiences with different vendors always turns out to be useful.<br /><br />He DIDNTt ask me to FE, that&#039;s what I was surprised about. FrankMatthews for example always sends a pm saying something like &quot;this is an automated message bla bla please FE&quot;. (Is it really automated or does he just copy and paste that text, lol?) Anyway maybe he just forgot it.. His profile says orders under 500$ have to be FE&#039;d, since when is that anyway? If I remember correctly, a month or so ago he didn&#039;t require FE, right? I think it&#039;s kinda sad, people from the same country and with more than 10 orders/okay stats shouldn&#039;t have to FE to get quality products.. oh well. (also my stats aren&#039;t soo bad I guess, 0% refund, 0% autoFE, ~50BTC spent (probably most of them back when a coin was worth around 8€ lol), and 16 orders total.) <br /><br />Anyway, thanks for your replies.<br />I&#039;m from Germany btw. thats why I was hoping for the highly praised super fast 24h shipping time. But it&#039;s ok. Like I said, I just had to vent a bit aka getting more posts

				Hey guys, just wanted to let you know: ITS HERE キタ━━━(゜∀゜)━━━!!!!<br />Usually theres some private post-service that delivers at around 11am and the normal post delivering around 1-2pm and never would I have thought that something might arrive with yet ANOTHER service that apparently delivers in the afternoon hours.<br /><br />So now it&#039;s here and I&#039;m super happy and my weekend is saved, thank god!<br />Sorry again for all the moaning, blaming and unnecessary whining.

				My advice if something is desperately needed for a big night out in the future, and you&#039;ve got the money, then why not order two lots off separate vendors? Less chance of your night out being ruined then.

				Glad it worked out for you! I&#039;m getting ready to place an order with ST to the U.S. but I&#039;m contemplating if I really want to make an international order. I know people do it all the time with great success, but there&#039;s the whole customs thing that has me worried.

				@Smarties Yea thats a good idea, I did that in the past with 2 other vendors. Or I could also just order it earlier if I&#039;m planning something but this time I just didn&#039;t have the money/enough money in time and I also wanted to stick with domestic vendors for a while since my last order apparently got seized. And there don&#039;t seem to be comparable H-vendors in Germany.. Anyway, thanks for the tip!<br /><br />@jda6130 thanks, yes I always feel a bit uncomfortable when ordering internationally too, hmm. Sometimes I&#039;m a bit jealous because some US vendors won&#039;t ship internationally and there are lots of great vendors over there too, so be sure to have a thorough look at them. I&#039;d only order internationally if I had absolutely no other option, but that&#039;s just me being impatient, paranoid and not exactly financially well-situated and thus easily stressed out IF something goes wrong or missing. And that risk is significantly higher ordering internationally but on the other hand, like you said, most oders make it through so giving it a try probably wouldn&#039;t hurt seeing as ST seems to be a very good and reliable vendor. Argh.. I&#039;m being super helpful again.. sorry<br /><br />@013517 yea be careful, lol. I just couldn&#039;t handle the comedown and post-high-depression, uppers just aren&#039;t my thing. Be good to your brain and neurotransmitters or else they&#039;ll torture you for weeks.. at least that&#039;s how it is for me. ugh<br /><br />cheers!

				Ok here a little mini-review: I noticed SuperTrips&#039; H #4&nbsp; is darker than on the pics (the color almost looks #3-ish instead of the beige/white/grey color one would expect ) but its heavy and crumbly unlike #3.<br />It also doesn&#039;t have this vinegary smell, it smells rather sweet, almost like Popcorn or something, lol. I still have to heat it to make it dissolve (faster).. Also it doesn&#039;t give me this really intense smell and taste in the back of my throat (taking it i.v.)... I mean, it&#039;s there but not as prominent as with #3. Also the high doesn&#039;t last as long imo.<br /><br />So, this is the first time I&#039;m trying china white, can anybody tell me if what I described is normal and what your #4 looked/smelled/was like?

				Anyone in the UK ordered from SuperTrips and, if so, how long did your order take to arrive? I&#039;ve been waiting a week now since he supposedly sent it. Seems a long time to me but when I messaged him he said it can take 7-11 days. Yet his profile says 3-7 days is the norm.<br /><br />Beginning to think it&#039;s not gonna show now. I&#039;ve ordered from Frank Matthews in the NL and it normally takes 3 days once he&#039;s put it in transit.

				@jda6130<br />Underground Syndicate is re-selling SuperTrips gear in the US -- so could have his gear and don&#039;t have to go international ... it&#039;s 30$ more expensive though ...<br /><br />@12monkeys<br />We share a lot of the experience with SuperTrips and his gear ^^ ... it also took quite a while even it was domestical - I also missed any vinegar-like-smell (for me it wasn&#039;t like popcorn but more like a weak coffee&#039;ish smell) - and also I&#039;m sad about the gear having barely legs (the sensation is over after few hours) ... next time I&#039;m going with Franks #4 - maybe it&#039;s better.<br /><br />... and: don&#039;t be jealous of the US vendors -- a good part of them is ordering the stuff they are selling from the EU themselves ;) Of course there are other sources and delivery channels as well, but imo most of the dope is coming from source (around Afghanistan) to the big harbors in EU (maybe Hamburg, for sure Rotterdam etc. ...) and from there to the US.<br /><br />Have a nice week you all o/<br /><br />PS: If anyone has sampled both, Franks and SuperTrips #4 recently I&#039;d love to hear about any comparison :)
