				Ello SR blazed as fuck just got back from a concert and high as shit. I saw A Day To Remember, Of Mice&amp;Men and Chuck! No Captain Chuck! it was fucking sweet! Anyway back to the thread, so I&#039;m stoned and I am going to tell you a story<br /><br /><br /><br />The first time I used a telescope.<br /><br />I was 5 years old and at the time I was living in Mundur, India and it was in the summer I think it was August. My grandmother was off at the beach with her new boy toy (I am convinced she is a pimp but I&#039;ll get to her in another edition so stay tuned) and she literally just left me with a local shaman his name was Pundar. Thank God he was normal and didn&#039;t molest me that God, so he asks me in broken English if I wanted to see the stars on the mountain top. I say yes and he tells me to come back at night. So he just leaves and I am wandering around town and I stumble upon an extremely poor book store and they had an ancient edition of National Geographic and it was about the Hindu Gods but that&#039;s not what caught my eye it had a bunch of pictures of space. So I didn&#039;t realize I had to pay for it and I walked out and no one noticed. Anyway I get to see these amazing pictures so, I head back to his house and he is ready to take me up the mountain and we can star gaze I brought along my little telescope. We are on top of the mountain and I ask him for something to drink he looked me dead in the eye and said &quot;drink this it will make you relax&quot;. He pours two cups of what I now know to be Ayawaska and I was so high and I was seeing these images like in the book and Pandar is explaining to me Hinduism.<br /><br />So that was the first time I used a telescope haha, sorry this is a short one but I have longer ones that involve much more danger<br /><br />post questions or comments hell leave a country and if I&#039;ve been there I will tell a story

You can get DMT out of plants. Thats just my logic behind it, all I know is I drank it and tripped balls sounds like Ayahuasca to me sir.

Now at this point in my life I was very anti-drug and I said I didn&#039;t want to do any of it. So he takes 3 tabs and I ask hi isn&#039;t that too much? he tells me to sod off I scoff and we are just talking. Forty five minutes later we were talking about contacts with beings from a different planet and he says &quot;Bloke these tabs are strong I&#039;m starting to feel bad.&quot; I am laughing because I think he is joking, but he gets up and screams &quot;There coming out of the ground!&quot;, &quot;Run for your fucking lives save the Queen.&quot; Next thing we know two Russian cops show up and I don&#039;t speak Russian, but Monty did. From what I could understand he literally told them to fuck off in Russian, we get arrested and my grandmother pays a hefty fine and proceeds to beat me and Monty within a half inch of our lives I still have scars haha&nbsp; &nbsp;
