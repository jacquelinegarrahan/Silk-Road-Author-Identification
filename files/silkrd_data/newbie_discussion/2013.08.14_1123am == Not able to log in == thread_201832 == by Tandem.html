				There are a few threads on this topic but since I just can post here as a new member I decided to make another one.<br />As the title says I&#039;m not able to log in on the mainpage. I had the problem a while ago when I first heard of Silkroad and wanted to check the site out. It took me countless tries until I was finally able to get through the login, I thought it finally worked and haven&#039;t visited the site since. Now I wanted to buy something for the first time and made a new account but again was unable to log in. After I put in my accountdetails it just refreshes the page without an error or anything else. I&#039;ve tried it with different accounts, restarted Tor, reinstalled it, even tried it with the newest version of Tails, nothing worked. Is this a common problem for other people too or am I just missing out something obvious?<br />

				<br /><br />&nbsp; It&#039;s happening a lot lately, unfortunately, but not affecting everyone. I personally have never really had an issue. Hope you get on soon, Hitch.
