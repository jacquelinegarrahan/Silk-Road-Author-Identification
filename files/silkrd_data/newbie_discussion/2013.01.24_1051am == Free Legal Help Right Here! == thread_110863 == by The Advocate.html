				Hello fellow libertarians,<br /><br />Once in a great while I discover something that changes my view of life.&nbsp; Silk Road is one of those things.&nbsp; I feel compelled to help this community any way I can, as you have all been so very good to me.&nbsp; I feel blessed to work beside you and fight for the winning team in the war on drugs.&nbsp; As a criminal defense atty, I see the lives that are destroyed as a result of the tyranny of our governments.&nbsp; I see first hand the lives it destroys.&nbsp; The families torn apart.&nbsp; The dreams, shattered.&nbsp; I have lost a very close friend to the war on drugs.&nbsp; Eventually, I came to accept the status quo on some level.&nbsp; This, worries me.&nbsp; I&#039;m worried that I will continue shuffling along in submission to these unlawful policies that regulate our bodies and unjustifiably punish the most sick and desperate of our citizenry.&nbsp; When I found Silk Road I realized that there is still hope for me to change my apathetic attitude.&nbsp; There is hope that we can make the most of our lives.&nbsp; Enjoying them to the fullest.&nbsp; Finding reality in what was a long lost dream of mine when I was younger.&nbsp; My life has been made new because of what Silk Road means.&nbsp; I now realize once again that we own our bodies.&nbsp; And you know what; we now are delivering the death touch to our government&#039;s unlawful policies.&nbsp; We are revolutionaries.&nbsp; We have almost won.&nbsp; An idea whose time has come cannot be stopped by any army or any government.&nbsp; Silk Road is more than a website.&nbsp; It&#039;s an idea.&nbsp; And we will eventually succeed.<br /><br />In the spirit of spurring us toward success, I realized something.&nbsp; We all have some talents that can help each of us make this community a safer, more prosperous, and more enjoyable place.&nbsp; For some, being a fair and honest vendor makes for the greatest contribution.&nbsp; For others, generously supporting the cause with their btc.&nbsp; For me, I am able to help us become wiser through legal help.&nbsp; Before I take any questions, I just want to say thank you to DPR and all of those that have risked their lives to making the world a freer and more enjoyable place for us.<br /><br />The first 3 persons who post here that voted for Ron Paul get 0.01btc sent to their SR wallet.&nbsp; Just PM me @TheAdvocate on the road so I can get your wallet address.<br /><br />I&#039;ll take any criminal law questions, but due to time constraints it may take me a while to respond.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try my best to answer any reasonable questions that I feel are of use to us as a community.<br /><br />Donations are welcome, and every last cent of the proceeds goes toward posting bail for a client who has fallen in the drug war.

				I really like this idea and we can expand upon it to make SR a protected community.&nbsp; We should have a thread for people that get into trouble from SR.&nbsp; One where people looking at time can ask questions and even ask for help if need be.&nbsp; If we became a family on here it will only make this revolution more of a revolution.&nbsp; When people run into trouble we&#039;ll be there with a few coins to help with legal help or bail.&nbsp; We will equip them with the right drugs (mushrooms or lsd)&nbsp; should they get put on probation and make life easier on them through the tragic time.&nbsp; There are enough people on here where even a dollar could help.&nbsp; Also im 100% Ron Paul all the way but i do not need compensation for that as it is expected that either support Mr. Paul or you are a terrorist

				Awesome to have you on the SR! I heard that Ron Paul wasn&#039;t on the list during the vote, so I didn&#039;t even bother to go vote for any of the other folks. Funny story... one time I was doing a computer repair house call and my clients where very talkative and they told me that Ron Paul was their gynecologist when they used to have kids. That&#039;s when I first learned about him years ago, and I&#039;ve been a fan of him ever since.

				Advocate, your OP sparks a renewal of interest in the feeling of unity/brotherhood/peace. This is the caring nature of the consciousness that we all are. That is the essence of this subculture, and you speak it very well :D <br /><br />I believe we should assemble an A-Team for Silk Road- where those with a legal background are dedicated to providing legal advise, an IT team for the technical aspects behind the site, etc.. I wonder what DPR would say.

				What a guy! Im sure youl be popular ;) Im here in the uk and iv been toying with the idea of a career change. Believe me I dont underestimate the commitment that becoming an attorney is I just have a small favour to ask. Before I enrol on any courses id like to know a few legal books literally idiots guides to law in general esp criminal law. Real starting with the basic principles etc. What im asking for a proffessor would normally do so I know its a big ask but I feel the right book at this moment in time could have a momentous effect on the direction I know deep down I want to go in <br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I like the idea of the community standing together against the evil oppressors.&nbsp; To quote some wise words i once heard &quot;For if you look away you&#039;ll be doing what they say and if you look alive you&#039;ll be singled out and tried.&quot;&nbsp; We should all stand up for each other in any way we can..... for if we don&#039;t we will be looking away.&nbsp; &quot;Nothing to see here, move along now.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As to SR being the start of the victory of the war I beg to differ.&nbsp; It is just another defensive measure developed in an arms race that has been going on for the whole war.&nbsp; 99 years of war so far, and in my country (where the war was started and the one who has been most aggressive in spreading it), it looks like the end is still a long way away.&nbsp; I say that because the government has grown so large, using the war as an excuse, that now millions of people make their living as fighters in the war.&nbsp; Many of those people don&#039;t want to lose their jobs so will never vote to end the war.&nbsp; I myself was drafted into the war at the ripe age of 13 and have made a living as a fighter ever after.&nbsp; My fondest dream is that someday I will not have to live in constant fear anymore.&nbsp; To have a &quot;honest&quot; job.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If more people though like theadvocate, about helping their fellows the world would be a much better place.&nbsp; I am going to become a fan, and try to follow his example.

				Just wanted to stop in and say the advocate came through on bitcoins a few times for me, and that I love that silkroad is branching out into non-drug fields as well, we&#039;re creating a beautiful community here and there&#039;s no doubt in my mind that it takes all kinds to tear apart this power structure piece by piece and im glad that TheAdvocate is now apart of that :)

				Ok, I&#039;ve got a question for you. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say I have a clean record - no arrests, no nothing. Let&#039;s say I have a couple of degrees and have a full time, respectable job. I&#039;m white. I am a law-abiding citizen in all other respects and always have been. Let&#039;s say I start selling some prescription drugs via SR. Some of them I have a prescription for, some of them I don&#039;t. I&#039;m very careful. I sell low volume (10 orders per month, less than $1000 in value). I encrypt EVERYthing. I research safe practices, and follow them. <br /><br />But one day, let&#039;s say I slip up and get nabbed as I&#039;m dropping off a couple of orders in a mailbox. How deep is the shit I will be in? <br /><br />I suspect that with a good lawyer, and because of my safe practices (keeping a relatively clean house with strong encryption of all sensitive data), a conviction of any severity will be hard to obtain. But more importantly, I have a hard time believing LE gives a shit about my volume.

				That&#039;s a great answer, thanks for the time you took to write it out. It further galvanizes the directive to NEVER talk except to say, &quot;I&#039;d like to speak with my lawyer.&quot;<br /><br />But just for the sake of thought experiment, let&#039;s elaborate on the &quot;slip up&quot; part. Let&#039;s say someone I know only tangentially somehow hears that I&#039;m selling drugs via the internet. That acquaintance mentions it to their LE brother in the area. The LE is a hothead with nothing better to do in a small town. He follows me for a few hours a week and gets LUCKY in seeing me make a mailbox drop of several suspicious looking packages. He makes note of my drop location and time, and I&#039;m foolish enough to repeat another drop at the same time, same location 2 days later. This is enough for him to look into my activities more.<br /><br />Since he knows where I live, he asks the ISP to hand over data on my account (no warrant). ISP complies because they&#039;re dicks. I&#039;ve been careful not to use anything but Tor and PGP and encrypted drives for all sensitive communication. However, the data from the ISP shows that I&#039;ve been logging onto Tor (easily seen by a connection to a Tor node). <br /><br />Is this enough for them to get a warrant, bust down my door, and prosecute me for possession of some prescription drugs and shipping supplies? What if they could somehow match me with my vendor account on SR, let&#039;s say via metadata on one of my pictures for one of my listings? For the latter case (where they&#039;ve matched me to my vendor account), is the conviction sure? What do you think the sentence ballpark is? 1 year? 10? What kind of prison would I go to? I really have no clue, as I&#039;ve never been arrested before and have very little experience with legal proceedings. Just trying to get a feel here.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.<br /><br />

				If the police stop at my house to talk to me(say a crime happened down the block) and im not home but my door is unlocked and nothing is in view and their is no probable cause can they walk in? Also if i call 911 because of an overdose but never tell the dispatch it was an overdose just a seizure, is that probable cause to enter my residence? One last question (this actually happened to me) if I am in a hotel sleeping at the time and the police knock at the door (they said they were their because I had a recent drug conviction no other reason) if I would have said no is it my right or is it up to hotel policy. Honestly though how do my search and seizure rights not apply if i own(rent) the<br />room for the night?

I am really looking forward to an educated answer for this question!<br /><br />Fellow roaders!<br /><br />I have enjoyed reading everything you have posted here. It is very interesting read. In regards to this separating yourself from the system; I refer you to read upon the death of Socrates. If this world experienced a utopia like state then I think this would be applicable. As it looks now, I do not think it will solve things practically but rather worsen them. Not because you are trying to do the wrong thing, it is the opposite in fact and yes you are doing this in spirit of human rights and democracy, but there is too much hypocrisy and retardedness for this in the world you are living today. <br /><br />If you ever manage, somehow, to become free from oppression in this way then please let the rest of us here know :). <br /><br />Mr Advocate and everyone else who contributed nicely, you have my full support!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Entity

Just trying to get a feel here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m no attorney, but have been though the system...<br /><br />LE doesn&#039;t play by the rules... if they want you, they will do whatever to get you.&nbsp; My entire arrest report was fiction; cops actually took my keys off me then got into my apt complex &amp; my apt door.&nbsp; (I was outside talking to them, they had no warrant... nor could they see any crime being committed through windows etc.)&nbsp; When my attorney made a motion to dismiss the case due to this blatant violation of my rights... basically the judge just said he believed the cops that both doors were wide open whilst it being 5 degrees out/in the ghetto/5 am.&nbsp; (utterly laughable)&nbsp; Still even that didn&#039;t make sense to me either though... even if doors are open while I&#039;m talking to them outside, that shouldn&#039;t give them the right to search.&nbsp; Anyways... court could be a toss up, you never know.<br /><br />Basically I&#039;m just saying... if you have problems with some dude&#039;s cop brother possibly on your ass, it&#039;s best to play it safe.&nbsp; Stop.<br /><br />And if you do ever get busted, expect a whole plethora of additional fictional charges... like a car salesman, expecting you&#039;ll eventually want to cop a plea, they start high so you&#039;ll have to work them down.&nbsp; (your attorney will have to waste effort on whittling away the frivolous stuff)&nbsp; Looking at possibly 65+ years for some stuff you grew etc. will put you in shock.&nbsp; In your case, google your states controlled substance act... controlled substance penalties are harsh.&nbsp; &nbsp;(I literally seen murders get less time than me) <br /><br />When you first get arrested, you go to jail.&nbsp; You will have a bond hearing, if you make bond, you can live irl while on trial... if you cant make bond, then you stay in jail while on trial.&nbsp; Some trials can take years.&nbsp; Each jail is different... some are absolute hell, others aren&#039;t so bad.&nbsp; In my case, I couldn&#039;t wait to get to prison.&nbsp; Once convicted... the jail will transfer you to a prison receiving center most likely.&nbsp; Each state handles things differently I imagine, but in high prison pop places the first month will be like a big separation process... filtering different types of people to different places.&nbsp; Like they don&#039;t want warring gangs in the same place etc.&nbsp; Or they don&#039;t want minimum security cases with hard core murderers doing triple life or whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp; Depending on where you finally end up, you might go to a place that lets you have a tv, buy food, make phone calls... it&#039;s really boring and the food will absolutely blow. You might end up in a worse place.&nbsp; &nbsp;But just like in the movie Blow, you will make a ton or connections if you want, and you will learn how to be a better criminal.&nbsp; Doing time isn&#039;t the hard part, it&#039;s living afterward.... nobody cares how nice you are etc., all they see is that you&#039;re an excon.&nbsp; Good luck finding work/gf/life.<br /><br />Note: In many states, if you do cop a plea... you automatically lose your right to appeal.&nbsp; (nobody tells you this though).&nbsp; And typically if you do want to appeal, you only have a very short period of time to file in many states (30 days?)... so get on that like ASAP.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong here, OP.<br /><br />Go Ron Paul!<br /><br />@OP... wish you were my attorney when I was in need, sounds like you&#039;re much better. <br /><br />Wow, that was long... sry<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unfortunately, your story is all too common.&nbsp; You touched on many points and some of them are perfectly correct and others vary by jurisdiction.&nbsp; There are many types of plea deals and some of them offer more leverage to come back and win than others.&nbsp; Generally, a guilty plea is a conviction.

But after thinking for a while, I think it is a pretty good question; if we are all born equal, with the same &#039;human rights&#039; and what not, then why do groups of individuals (governments) have the right to impose their own decided views on other, supposedly equal individuals? Is there any way to separate yourself from the &#039;system&#039;, and live as an un-ruled individual?<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard something about the laws governments impose being &#039;Maritime&#039; laws which can only be enforced upon people who agree to be governed by them, and this is accomplished by some formalities in court. &#039;Common&#039; laws are the only laws that one is obliged to abide by, and they basically just say don&#039;t hurt / steal from other people. Advocate, if you know anything about this then I would love to have it made clear. Moreover, I&#039;d hate to be arrested and claim to be abiding by common law if it doesn&#039;t help me or mean anything. I&#039;m sure there are other people who&#039;d appreciate it too :)<br /><br />- JH<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; I just think that for some people, the words &quot;common law&quot; or &quot;maritime law&quot; have strong negative connotations.&nbsp; But yeah, that&#039;s what I was getting at.&nbsp; I appreciate you saying you thought it was a dumb question at first.&nbsp; It&#039;s amazing how entrenched the concept of authority is in us.&nbsp; I was saying in another thread how for a lot of people I talk to, the framework of government authority is not even visible to many...I mean to say that it&#039;s like a shell around their thoughts that contains everything they think and is therefore inaccessible to their conscious thought process.&nbsp; People just don&#039;t seem to fathom the concept.<br />One concept that has really stuck with me is the idea that the creator (us) can not be ruled by its creation (government), period.&nbsp; There&#039;re some really good quotes from dead dudes on the subject too ;)&nbsp; One is about how in a free and democratic society, the power of a government is dependent on the consent of the governed.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try and dig some of those up...<br />I really want to hear Advocate&#039;s thoughts on this.&nbsp; Many up here believe that the BAR Assoc. (which you must by law be a member of in order to practice law) is an &quot;old boys club&quot; and when you go to court, the judge, prosecutor, and your lawyer are are all in the club and are all getting paid by the Plaintiff ie. The Crown.&nbsp; Using a lawyer is akin to surrender.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been to court except as an observer, so this is all just stuff that I see people trying as we&#039;re attempting to reclaim some of our rights.&nbsp; And also, Advocate, I really hope you don&#039;t take any of this as a personal attack.&nbsp; People are just really really frustrated that we don&#039;t seem to have the rights that were entrenched in our own constitution, and we somehow can&#039;t break through to the point where a peaceful man can exercise his right not to belong to an association if he doesn&#039;t want to.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fuck the DA!&nbsp; I&#039;m not in court to make friends and if I&#039;m not making enemies I&#039;m not doing my job correctly.

She knows what&#039;s coming next.&nbsp; More exculpatory evidence.&nbsp; I enjoy this job!&nbsp; Anyways he is looking at losing his whole life and family and house and career but he&#039;s not coppin&#039; pleas.&nbsp; Fucking balls on that guy.&nbsp; MY fave clients have balls like that.&nbsp; Anyways, bail was couple hundo thousand but this next hearing I should get it down to $10k.&nbsp; After that, it&#039;s a piece of cake for me to post it for him.&nbsp; If in case I fail to get bail lowered to my affordability point, how can I prove to you all these things?&nbsp; I certainly could never indicate the name of my client, or myself.&nbsp; I could prove that it&#039;s not going to me, personally though.&nbsp; I&#039;d have you pay direct to the commissary fund or the bail agency.&nbsp; But then again..anonymity issues.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br /><br />Ok I got so excited at the idea that a vendor of your stature cares about an upstanding citizen behind bars that I forgot all about your question.<br /><br />&quot;Many people worry that if they order chemicals online, or buy them from a local chemical distributor and even if those chemicals are in no way illegal or listed, that they can arouse suspicion.&quot; <br />- If LE finds out about it, that means they were probably already looking at the subject.&nbsp; So it depends.&nbsp; When I say &quot;stupid criminals&quot; I&#039;m talking about criminals that see everything in black and white.&nbsp; They think they&#039;re completely safe until they believe their completely busted.&nbsp; Indeed it is more of a spectrum.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen cases where the person had ziplock sandwhich bags in their kitchen drawer and it was used against them.&nbsp; Effectively.&nbsp; Iodine alone might not be incriminating to a pool serviceman, but when coupled with a beaker and pseudoephedrine cold pills the scene begins to take on a different complexion [for the same pool serviceman/involved person].&nbsp; The surrounding circumstances have a great deal to do with whether or not the chemicals you sell are damning.&nbsp; Not just the chemicals themselves.<br /><br />&quot;My understanding is that unless you order a drug precursor or one of a set of lists, no warrants can be gotten or anything.&nbsp; Did this change post 9/11? In my extended experiance, like you said, the dumb criminals keep the cops busy.&quot;<br /><br />- Much like my answer above, I&#039;d have to say that depending on the facts of the case a non-precursor is much better than a known precursor.&nbsp; Always there is the issue of how LE came to know about the chemical in the first place, which might be the best question and all the more reason to never speak to police when you are the suspect of a serious crime.&nbsp; There could be perfectly innocent explanations for why you ordered that chemical.&nbsp; But until you see the evidence against you it&#039;s better to leave those explanations open.<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for all this information. It is very helpful.<br /><br />After being involved in stuff like this for over 10 years, I&#039;ve managed to stay out of trouble so far. It&#039;s a priority for me to keep it that way.<br /><br />Other than the obvious &quot;don&#039;t do anything illegal&quot; bit, are there any seemingly obvious things people can do to stay out of trouble?<br /><br />Perhaps just a checklist of common sense stuff. It can be easy to overlook simple things.

				I had suggested once that they should add a &#039;donate to legal trust fund&#039; button to the checkout.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then donators to the fund can draw legal help/representation from the fund pending on how much you contribute.&nbsp; The Trust Fund would help pay for legal expenses for SR members and vendors in trouble.&nbsp; It would have a board of directors and retain a lawyer for everyone to benefit from.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its time to offer some protection / insurance for members who want to pay for it.&nbsp; Those who don&#039;t contribute to the fund get nothing from it.&nbsp; Sounds fair.&nbsp; I&#039;d pay something each month for the lawyer / trust fund as well as donations at each checkout purchase.&nbsp; A running total can be tallied up for each contributor and that would determine how much legal assistance you can get from the fund.<br /><br />Most members are middle-class working people who could benefit from such a trust fund.&nbsp; There is nothing illegal about setting up an independent corporation/trust fund that offers legal services to its paying members.<br /><br />This would help pay for his legal fees and the board of directors and committee members would choose who gets assistance and at what amount, based on the members contributions into the fund.<br />Group plans work well.<br /><br />Just a thought to help pay for this generous offer from the OP.

				I&#039;ll try to answer your question (white male with degrees up above) since the lawyer doesn&#039;t want to. A member of my team, in fact, my best friend, got arrested in a similar position you are in. Minus the mail stuff and shipping online. He had a degree, a job, did volunteer work, was white, and fresh out of college. And he got arrested selling heroin to local college kids. He had a quarter pound. That&#039;s a lot of heroin considering it sells for $100-120/gram in the area. They were incredibly lenient on him because of his non-criminal history but with sales of that magnitude (yours isnt nearly as large but I dont know what the mailing aspect would do to you), it is always hard to avoid doing any time. He did 9 months but got it converted to house arrest and did not have to quit his job or anything. Served four and a half months with half time. Was allowed onto a drug program after, completed it successfully after passing the required number of piss tests and x number of meetings, and then had his record expunged completely so that it didn&#039;t appear on background checks. All of this is in southern California though with its drug courts, drug diversion programs, etc.

				Hello all,<br /><br />SR Vendor Support has suspended my account.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t given a reason.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t asked any questions.&nbsp; The only thing I can thing of is that my vendor account was showing inaccurate information, such as my being a vendor for 4 months, then 5, then 4, then 6, etc.&nbsp; There was other inaccurate information, is my best guess.&nbsp; I recieved DPR&#039;s blessing to give legal advice and sell btc, but that policy may have changed.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, I will not likely be selling legal advice on SR ever again.&nbsp; I was giving my legal advice in exchange for positive reviews.&nbsp; I had a 100% approval rating on the 5/5 scale.&nbsp; I know people thanked me for my help.&nbsp; Hopefully I&#039;ve been some help to you.&nbsp; Thank you for all the great feedback.&nbsp; I wish you all well.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />TheAdvocate

I&#039;d be game.&nbsp; The vendors and consumers of SR are a class act, and this case reaffirms this conclusion of mine.<br />I must say that SR might be due for some viable competition.&nbsp; I still believe in the road.&nbsp; But maybe it&#039;s time that a few other roads pop up, in order to keep SR on it&#039;s toes..?

				I can&#039;t say they are incompetent in general.&nbsp; I never had any problems the entire time I dealt here.&nbsp; I think this was just an isolated incident of a careless rush to judgement.
