				I&#039;m looking to buy and use MDMA for the first time. Was wondering whos the best to buy from quality wise? Don&#039;t want to get screwed with RC&#039;s or anything. Preferably as pure as I can get it.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to a 3 day concert soon and thought that would be the perfect place to try it.

				Heres one, but it doesn&#039;t seem to be too active.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187.1185<br /><br />Bad news is it looks like ivory requires FE for all international orders now (Ivory is based in the UK)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Many of the top vendors on the road for MDMA have very good quality stuff. As in, much, much higher quality than you often find on the street. It is quite an interesting phenomenon IMO: the MDMA on the road is incredibly cheap, but so pervasively very good quality, yet IME the stuff you find on the street is 9 times out of 10 very low quality or not MDMA at all. It&#039;s interesting to me that with so many vendors from many different places in the world on the Road selling top quality stuff from a variety of sources, how is it that none of it makes its way onto the street at least only minorly adulterated? Most of the stuff I find on the street has been stomped on by a stampede. Just sucks that people are so keen on making a buck that they&#039;ll totally ruin the beauty that is MDMA. Anyways...<br /><br />I can attest to two vendors quality: polygamuz (but he&#039;s not a vendor anymore I believe) and LuckyLucianno (but he only sells in bulk).<br /><br />If you do a little research of some of the bestselling vendors on the road and look at their reveiws in the forum here, there are many that will provide a high quality product with a very, very low chance of it being cut with anything at all, especially with a cut that&#039;s active. Many vendors will ship you rocks. The difference that seems to occur with MDMA quality is merely the result of what impurities are left when the chemist yields his/her final product. Some stuff is a high % MDMA HCL, some stuff is lower. I would say that most of the best vendors on the road have 70-84% MDMA HCL (from what I&#039;ve read, 84% is the highest possible yield one can achieve with mdma, the other 16% being the hydrochloride [HCL]). If it&#039;s not 84% MDMA HCL, say it&#039;s 80%, then the 4% would be impurities which are not likely harmful when taking the dosages that one would take for a roll. <br /><br />Then, there&#039;s also another factor that I believe is definitely a huge factor, which I also believe is a factor for most any substance, especially psychedelics, and that is the energy that goes into and manner in which the chemical is made and handled. It&#039;s certainly not an empirically verifiable factor, but subjectively I absolutely believe that if someone puts the care and love into making and distributing a particular chemical, that chemical will feel better. I believe that the one who creates these molecules (in a lab or by growing) puts their energy into it and contributes vibrations (either positive or negative) into the molecule. I notice this with entheogenic substances especially. I&#039;ve had some MDMA that was potent and strong, and still enjoyable, but was lacking a certain sort of genuineness. I&#039;ve had other MDMA that had a felt amount unique magic that affected me in way that seemed magically impossible. It was as though the person who made it was creating it like an artist creates a song or a painting. I could feel the heart and soul that went into the creation of the batch of the molecule, the genuineness of its creator. <br /><br />Many people say mdma is mdma is mdma or lsd is lsd is lsd. In a scientific sense, yes, this is true. But there is a felt difference if you allow yourself to be aware of it.<br /><br />That being said, LuckyLucianno&#039;s stuff is pretty fuckin&#039; magical! I highly recommend. I think there is a domestic reseller who will sell smaller amounts. Used to be Empathy101 I think, but I&#039;m not sure if he sells it anymore.
