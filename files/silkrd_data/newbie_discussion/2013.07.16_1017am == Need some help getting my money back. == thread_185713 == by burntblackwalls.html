				Hey there.<br /><br />I placed an order last friday with a vendor that had it claimed on their page and product listing that I wouldn&#039;t need to FE.<br /><br />The order was then marked to be in transit and the vendor then asked for me to FE.<br /><br />After so much back and forth and arguing where I basically said can I please FE or not order at all,then he is now saying they will keep the order in escrow but change the shipping to express ( this is an international order )<br /><br />I feel like after all of this back and forth that they are just trying to keep my money, because if I let this go though ( 13 days left before AF and the product has still not been sent ) the vendor could resolve it and take my money.<br /><br />I want the vendor to cancel my order, would this affect my stats ? I know the package has not been sent and the vendor has been asking for FE while I have either said no to FE or cancel and I still have not gotten my money back.<br /><br />What would you do in my position ?

				As long as all the messages are in plain text and not encrypted. The SR staff will definitely side with you. Go into resolution once you can and ask for a 100% refund and dont relent until staff step in and tell them it was never sent because their policies said no required FE and they asked you to FE. First however, ask the vendor to either let it stay in escrow or cancel the order. You did say they would let it stay in escrow with the express option so that should be fine with you.

				Remember, if it doesnt come before auto finalize you can go into resolution and ask for an extension, allowing for more time before auto finalize.
