				Some sellers accept addresses that are unencrypted, but sending your address via PM without PGP is even more risky than putting it unencrypted in the address field. If you want to get busted though, send him your address unencrypted. Look at the tutorials, PGP is really easy anyways.

				Not neccesary in some peoples eyes but pretty damn important. Some vendors will not accept your order if&nbsp; you don&#039;t use pgp.Lots of buyers wouldn&#039;t order from a vendor who doesnt use PGP. <br /><br />it really isn&#039;t that difficult, i recommend astors guide, i found it really helpful.

The low hanging fruit who didn&#039;t encrypt their address or the low hanging fruit who did encrypt their address not knowing that the vendor was also compromised? <br /><br />You have to understand what PGP is and what PGP isn&#039;t. What it is, is just a degree of separation between you and anyone who might intercept communications between you and the vendor. That&#039;s it. Think of it as a bullet proof vest which doesn&#039;t protect your head, extremities or even your family jewels. <br /><br />Why am I approaching it in this manner? Because, while you may secure yourself with PGP, you may be negligent in other areas of security or identity which defeats the purpose of PGP. PGP is just one part of your protective armour. It is not a suit of armour. <br /><br />TL;DR - while PGP covers your chest and back, it doesn&#039;t cover your arse. Don&#039;t overweight it as a matter of security, but don&#039;t under weight it either. Rather, incorporate it as part of a balanced approach towards securing your identity and putting a degree of separation between you and your illicit activities. <br /><br />Also note that many vendors who accept all forms of communication are vendors that have protected themselves with degrees of separation from you and SR and often the product itself. Or at least they should have. PGP only vendors on the other hand, if compromised, may divulge their PGP passcode and you wouldn&#039;t know it until it is too late. For example, RC vendor davidd.

				From what I understand exit nodes aren&#039;t encrypted. Tor just provides anonymity: you can&#039;t tell where a message came from. Messages are encrypted within the Tor network, but the exit node sends the unencrypted message to the destination server (otherwise the server wouldn&#039;t be able to read it). The exit node can eavesdrop on any communications it sends, so you are basically trusting the exit node. Anyone can set up an exit node.<br /><br />A scheme like SSL (that you use with your bank or when buying on Amazon) involves trusted public/private key distribution. The bank has a private key, a certificate authority certifies its public key to say that it belongs to the bank, you encrypt things with the bank&#039;s public key, it decrypts them with its private key that only the bank has. In this way you are sure nobody except the bank can see what you send.<br /><br />On SR the seller has his private key, he publishes his public key on his seller profile, you encrypt your message with it, only he can decrypt it with his private key. In this way you are sure nobody except the seller can see what you send.<br /><br />SR encrypts the STORED address, so that if SR gets hacked, your address is encrypted. But that happens only after SR has received the address. If you don&#039;t encrypt it yourself with PGP then the exit node can see it and it will be sent to the SR servers from the exit node in plaintext. That is my understanding, please correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				Different sellers have different policies regarding to what - if any - extent PGP encryption is required for conveying personal information. However, the vast majority of sellers seem to accept orders from people who have not encrypted (or sent via privnote) tunheir address, yet strongly prefer it when buyers use PGP.<br /><br />Every time you place an order with a seller for the first time, it&#039;s IMPERATIVE that you read their entire seller profile carefully, as well as read the listing(s) for the item(s) you&#039;re purchasing from them from beginning to end. Sellers generally address this issue on their seller profile &amp; clearly state their person policies regarding PGP encryption of mailing addresses &amp; anything else along significantly similar lines. If a seller does not specify their policy on the topic in question anywhere in their seller profile, it&#039;s safe to assume that there&#039;s no added expectations that PGP be implemented when purchasing product(s) from them.

				PGP is a tool. One you can choose to use, or choose not to. Quite simple, really. Do you trust the Silk Road to keep your information safe, and with that, do you believe that you are at a severe risk when sending that information over Tor? Personally, I do not use PGP for 90% of the things I do on here. Ordering from multiple vendors, different keys, separating orders...It&#039;s just too much of a pain in the ass for me to want to use it when all I want is some pot and maybe a few tabs of Lucy. The way I see it is this, I cover my ass when I order, I cover it well. If, by chance, a LE agency happened to snatch up my address....who cares? Seeing them try to prove that I&#039;m the one who ordered anything off of here would be, at the minimum, amusing.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m not saying PGP doesn&#039;t have its times when you should use it. As said earlier, it&#039;s a vest, and if you&#039;re in the danger zone, put that bitch on. When ordering bulk for redistribution or even personal use (Stoners) then PGP it up. <br /><br />I know I&#039;m about to catch more flak than a B17 over Germany, but if you&#039;re ordering an 1/8th of pot and maybe some MDMA or LSD or Shrooms or whatever, then I don&#039;t think you need to worry about the DEA kicking your door in.

				Just imagine if SR was compromised and LE announced they had access to all the archived orders and messages.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t you feel a little less doomed if you had used PGP every time you sent your NAME and ADDRESS to a vendor to BUY DRUGS?<br /><br />Furthermore, imagine this scenario, knowing that many users didn&#039;t encrypt their names and addresses.&nbsp; Who do you think LE will focus on?&nbsp; Encrypted or unencrypted addresses?<br /><br />Always use PGP!

				Lets say the LE had compromised SR to that dangerous of a degree, which may or may not happen some day I don&#039;t know? But people don&#039;t always need to use PGP when talking with a vendor or other member because it doesn&#039;t give away their name and their address in anyways.<br /><br />That&#039;s why many vendors actually ask you not to use PGP in personal messages unless it discloses personal information that the government could use to harm you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve once heard that the government purchased the last gateway used when sending the address to the vendor (I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s true or not) but I DO recommend always using PGP when sending your address to a vendor, but besides that there is no reason to waste your time with always encrypting every message

				Sending your delivery address un-encrypted is king of like ordering and giving out your info over a loudspeaker. Not only to mention if the SR database was ever compromised and you had an order processing at the time. You are now on an SR customer list you don&#039;t want to be on.

				From the wiki (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Receiving_address). My only hope is that it&#039;s true:<br /><br />Receiving address<br /><br />From the moment you submit your order, to the moment it is displayed to your vendor, the information is fully encrypted and totally unreadable. Then, as soon as your vendor marks your package with the address and confirms shipment, the address is deleted forever and is irretrievable. For the extra cautious, you can encrypt your information yourself with your vendor&#039;s public key so that even we at Silk Road would be unable to view it, even if we wanted to.

				Hmm is PGP really necessary...you are surfing in an encrypted network, paying with cryptocurrency which seems to be pretty safe( at least if you are human being who tends to make decisions based on logical patterns)...and you really risk your safety for a few seconds of lazyness? Anyway you never now, what your vendor does with your address, i would only wish they are all really only using some Linux-on-a-stick and the customer data additionally is secured with TrueCrypt, just in case, they got busted. On the other hand, as long as you don&#039;t use a real clear name...what would happen. I also happen to use a false identity for over 10 years, if this poor guy really existed and once got busted...uh :D <br />So as a consensus, if you want to understand the idea, the future and everything about SR and BTC, you better learn to use PGP. With Echelon and other stuff already up and running, try to keep the rest of you privacy...don&#039;t throw it away or you will wake up after &quot;1984&quot; and be living in a &quot;Brave New World&quot; without even recognizing it ;) Nuff said...
