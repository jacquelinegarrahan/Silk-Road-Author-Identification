				&nbsp;:P I know many people are waiting (some more patiently than others) for deposits to be posted to their accounts, including me and this is not a good time for this to be happening. BTC prices are dropping fairly quickly. Nothing dramatic but a steady and slightly faster than normal decline over the last 6-8 hours. I have been watching the pattern over the last several months and the decline started a little sooner than I would have thought and is moving a bit quicker than other drops recently. I hope the deposit situation is resolved soon so everyone can do business instead of sitting around watching our coin become less valuable.

				not much can be done about currency fluctuations, and SR will often take a few hours to get the coin thru.<br /><br />Just gotta get that shopping cart ready, transfer the coin through, then madly hit f5 for hours and hope SR doesn&#039;t get ddosed in the meantime.

				I hear you. I&#039;m wanting to get an item, but if the avg. value drops any lower than around $116 I will not have enough BTC once the coins go through.<br /><br />I keep debating whether I should deposit another coin to be sure I have enough. But I don&#039;t want to tie up another coin if the delay is indefinite. But the longer I wait to decide, the longer (seemingly) it would take for the additional coin to get through. It&#039;s terribly challenging to decide what I should do!

I&#039;m not complaining, just bemoaning the bad timing. A delay like this doesn&#039;t benefit anybody (except speculators and shorters maybe) and I feel bad for some of you guys getting slammed by people who think they know it all and are sure they&#039;re being screwed. Your patience and courtesy with them is commendable. I salute you!

				I usually deposit an extra 5% in. silly to have to do it, but means I dont have to end up waiting another 8 hours after the coin finally gets thru.

I have been padding my deposits recently, just in case. But this drop really is quicker than the recent normal. I agree with the other fellow (sorry! didn&#039;t check the name before posting) about the concern of not having enough coin for a particular purchase once deposits are posted. Hey maybe it&#039;ll start going back up. Wishful thinking, if it holds to recent trends it&#039;ll be a day or so before it starts going back up.
