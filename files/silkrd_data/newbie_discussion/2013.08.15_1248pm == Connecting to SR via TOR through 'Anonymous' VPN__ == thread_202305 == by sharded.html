				Hello good folks of SR <br />Just wanted to get some advice from people who know what the go is when it comes to VPN&#039;s?<br /><br />I&#039;ve had conflicting accounts given to me - 1. that since I boot from a usb and run a truecrypt encrypted VM from within said usb, I am fine;<br />and 2; - You stupid fuck, why aren&#039;t you using a VPN? I have looked at a whole bunch, and have found a few recommended by a computer site that let you pay via bitcoin, not use an email address, and allegedly &#039;keep NO logs&#039;<br /><br />Am aware that there are some great minds with experience on SR, so am hoping a few might .be inclined to give some advice??<br /><br />Thanks heaps

				If you search for member, astor, and read through his posts, you&#039;ll find a thread he recently started where he details various setups one could use, outlining the pros and cons of each one.

				VPN first and then run TOR through your VPN. The VPN gives you end to end encryption and it&#039;s pretty commonly used for businesses so your traffic blends in and then the VPN provider just looks like they are connecting to TOR instead of you.<br /><br />If you find a good anonymous one in another country, it makes the possibility of someone tracing you all the way nearly statistically impossible based on traffic analysis alone. Most people get in trouble because of their mouth though.
