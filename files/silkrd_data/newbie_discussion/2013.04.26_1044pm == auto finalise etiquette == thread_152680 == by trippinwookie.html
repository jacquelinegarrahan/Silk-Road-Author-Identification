				Yeah I&#039;m a complete noob. One of my orders auto finalises in a few days and it hasn&#039;t arrived, i&#039;m in unzud bro, it&#039;s understandable. But whats the go, the vendor&#039;s info page says don&#039;t finalise early, should I ask for an extension in the resolution page, send the vendor a message, what do people usually do, I&#039;m sure there are a lot of southern hemi crew that would be in a similar situation.

				I&#039;d send the vendor a message first and see what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />I made my third purchase here from a vendor who I&#039;m currently in dispute with - won&#039;t respond to messages.<br /><br />I order same product from another and he won&#039;t respond to my messages either. It&#039;s annoying because it shows them as visiting recently...I would just like some sort of communication.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t FE for either one (though one of the vendors I previously ordered from).

				Def contact the vendor to try and work out a solution. Otherwise you&#039;ll look like a bum and not have your stuff. Sadly being new doesn&#039;t give much leverage.<br /><br />Who&#039;s the vendor?

				From what I see, your best shot is to message your vendor and get an extension through the resolve button if it takes too long. Don&#039;t ever let your order auto-finalize. It&#039;s the one thing that would really hurt your reputation with the current and future vendors.

				Thanks for the advice guys, I figured a message to the vendor would be the way to go, but was holding off because I&#039;ve read that the message should be pgp encrypted, and that shit looks complicated. The package will probably arrive, I&#039;m in NZ, mail takes a while to get down here. Do many people encrypt messages and their addresses when they make an order.

I&#039;d raise a brow if a vendor doesn&#039;t provide PGP communication. It&#039;s your primary safeguard against getting caught (besides packages being detected in the mail). If you are sending sensitive information (aka: name and address), use encryption. Other messages need not be encrypted (aka: &quot;Hey where&#039;s my package?&quot;).

				I&#039;ve read that you only need to encrypt your address and not every single message you send to a vendor, but I&#039;m also new here so I could be wrong about that.<br /><br />And yeah the PGP stuff is kinda complicated but I found this video from youtube that shows you pretty easily how to do it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SywCI91kfq0<br />

Always pgp encrypt your address! It&#039;s not that complicated and is vital to your security. There are lots of resources here and elsewhere to help you learn how to do it. It looks complicated at first, but really isn&#039;t. If you can&#039;t figure that out, then ordering drugs online may not be for you.&nbsp; As a fallback - you can do the encryption online at https://www.igolder.com/pgp/encryption/ (that&#039;s clearnet, so don&#039;t do it through Tor).<br /><br />2. PM the vendor, and since it&#039;s so close to auto-finalize, get an extension if need be. If you don&#039;t hear back from the vendor, then you can put it into resolution.&nbsp; If you let it autofinalize, then the deal is finished and you aren&#039;t getting any resolution, plus your buyer stats are fucked up - a new buyer with 100% autofinalize may have some trouble placing orders. <br /><br />3. There are varying opinions on this, but mine is that you can send the PM to the vendor without pgp (do not include your address!). Your account having placed the order is in the SR system right now anyway, so inquiring about it shouldn&#039;t be a big deal.<br /><br /><br />

				thanks Cantharidin great info man, i will get the encryption thing sorted, I&#039;ve just been a bit naive (I&#039;m a newbie) and lazy. I did read somewhere on this forum that 80% of people don&#039;t encrypt their address when ordering on SR. Like I said I live in a small town in NZ so in most instances my mail will arrive after the auto finalise date. I&#039;ll message the vendor but if I don&#039;t get a reply in time i think I&#039;ll just finalise so it doesn&#039;t fuck my stats, its only a $30 order.

				auto finalise etiquette&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />Everyone here is speaking about PGP. WTF! <br /><br />There is no auto finalize etiquette. Most vendors get the package out to you the day after you order it - the good ones anyway! The post office does their job fast if you give the the true name and address you want it going to so why in the FUCK would you ever think it was okay to allow to auto finalize!<br /><br />1 reason only - YOUR DED!

				Encrypt anything you wouldn&#039;t want to read off of a slide in front of a jury. *<br />Does your message to the vendor include information that could be damning? If so, encrypt it. If it&#039;s as simple as, &quot;Hey, post around here is slow, OK with you to push this out in resolution for 10 days?&quot; - then that&#039;s pretty non-specific.<br /><br />And, well, everything Cantharidin said.<br />Might as well do it right and take this as a learning exercise, $30 or not. I know you&#039;re in a relatively civilized country... but... look, if I can do this, you can do this.<br />And there&#039;s something to be said for the philosophy of encryption for everything. &quot;The defendant only encrypted messages to Recipient Z.&quot;<br />Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s ever been used in court, but... if you have 80 unencrypted messages to assorted recipients, and 3 encrypted messages to 1 specific recipient... guess which ones are now of much more interest.<br /><br />Come over to Newbie PGP Club, people will let you test messages. Can PM me if you want but PGP club&#039;s a lot faster. ;-)<br /><br />--Dalmata<br /><br />*I truly hope that some day I am not reading this post in front of a jury. If so, in advance, I&#039;ll go on record as saying - irony is a real pain in the ass.<br />Meanwhile, I&#039;ll encrypt as possible.
