			<dd class="postbody">
				Firstly, how come this newbie page is just completely full of spam requests/offers for bitcoins? It sucks wading through the crap some fool has left on here!<br /><br />This is my first post, may be my last. I just have one question about heroin. I&#039;ve never taken it before, but intend to try it out as part of my ongoing experimentation with drugs. I&#039;m aware of the risks, the addictiveness, etc. I fully believe in my own ability to only sample it once - it has been that way with other things I&#039;ve tried. I just ordered 0.5g and a friend and I want to just smoke it (think the prospect of IV is a bit much for me really). <br /><br />What is the best way to go about smoking H? Can I just sprinkle some in a spliff, or should I be using a pipe? Also how much should I use? If I&#039;ve got 0.5g (from seller &#039;dispater&#039;) of what is meant to be alright quality stuff, then should that yield about 3 doses each?<br /><br />Thanks for any and all help you can give, I appreciate it. Only going to do this once so want to do it right!<br /><br />-facetoface

				Hey dude. I can promise that you will not only do it just once. That does not mean youll be all out H addict, but isnt the point of experimenting to see what drugs if any we enjoy, and if we enjoy it, why deprive your self? lol<br /><br />&nbsp;I dont smoke it, i snort, but the most common way to smoke is to use tin foil.&nbsp; Hold your lighter about 1 inch below the underside of the foil, below the dop. Have a pen tube, or straw in your lips already, then chase the dragon baby, lol. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks brother, appreciate the advice! I do intend to only do it once, just cause I&#039;m aware that it has such high potential for abuse - I know the options aren&#039;t only addict/non-user though, haha. Just reckon this mindset is the best one to have: a cautious one. <br />I did that same method when trying to smoke opium in India so that&#039;s cool, I reckon I can do it. It didn&#039;t really work that well with the opium so hopefully will have better results with this H.. <br /><br />Again thanks for your help - glad there are sensible and helpful people out here. Peace!

				Any time dude, always trying to help the community, even when it ends up fucking me some how.lol.<br /><br />Yea I use H on occasion, more recently than not.. I did it once like more than 10years ago, when i didnt have such a tight grip on my habits. Then got a bunch of stamps a few weeks ago, i have only used 4 times in the past 2 or 3 weeks, and it was 4 consecutive days. None in a week. Sadly not every one is able to do such things, and even stranger, i havnt experienced ANY withdrawal symptoms. Much love dude.

				First, what type of H did you buy.&nbsp; #3 or #4 or TAR?<br /><br />To answer you question, no, you cannot simply put it in a spliff and smoke it.&nbsp; Smoking H is called &#039;chasing the dragon&#039;.&nbsp; It&#039;s called that due to the method you need to use to smoke it.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Preparation Steps To Smoke Heroin:<br /><br />Heroin Smokers start by attaining a rectangular aluminum foil approximately 3 cms by 17 cms.<br /><br />You will also require some kind of funnel tube to help you inhale the vapor. One can be created from aluminum foil.<br /><br />The aluminum foil is then folded into half from its longer side and straitened as required in order to have an extremely flat surface.<br /><br />A chuck of Heroin is placed on one end of the foil that is closest to you.<br /><br />Begin applying gentle heat from a lighter or flame source to the lower surface of the aluminum foil in order to heat the heroin and have it start to boil.<br /><br />CAUTIOUS: DO NOT OVER HEAT AND INHALE TOO MUCH OF THE DRUG IN ORDER NOT TO OVERDOSE. GENTLE HEATING IS WHAT IS REQUIRED HERE.<br /><br />Whilst holding the Tube in your mouth and as the heroin boils and vapor is let off, start to inhale the vapor.<br /><br />Once you have inhaled stop heating, take a short break and re-heat when ready for another. Finding difficulty chasing the vapor? That&#039;s why they called it chasing the dragon, practice will make perfect.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />

				I think tar and #3 would be easiest to smoke.<br /><br />IF you got #4 just snort it.

				Yes, I believe that #3 is easier to smoke, something about a lower boiling point.&nbsp;

				Actually I&#039;ve always wondered why Heroin is smoked like that. It just seems like such a sketchy low rent way of going about it. People have been doing it for so long, you&#039;d think someone would have come up with a more high tech method. Or perhaps they have and I&#039;m just unaware of it?

				I got it from &#039;dispater&#039;, but it doesn&#039;t say what kind of H it is. Can anyone give me a rough idea? I don&#039;t want to chase the dragon if the dragon isn&#039;t actually there (if it&#039;s the wrong kind of H to be smoking). It&#039;s dispater&#039;s listing for 0.5g of it. It looks powdery. Going to try smoke it in about 12 hrs. <br />Thanks to everyone for the advice so far!

				You can smoke pretty much any &quot;real&quot; heroin.&nbsp; Basically use the foil/ straw method.&nbsp; There is some technique to it though, and you will waste a little at first, but thats just part of the game.

				dEF GO WITH SMOKING IT FIRST, if you dont like needles, then go for snorting it. General rule though, if its tar: smoke it. If its powder you have a 50/50 chance of each IMO.

You won&#039;t feel or have any withdrawal symptoms the first few times you use Heroin and it&#039;s that lack of symptoms that fucks you. You think it&#039;s not that bad, Whats all the fuss about, I can handle it. Then one day you wake up, you don&#039;t have any H and BANG the sickness hits you like a fukin freight train on stealth. You don&#039;t see it comin. you can&#039;t hear the rumble but it smacks you in the face like a left hook from Tyson and you realize its got its hooks deep under your skin. Respect the H man, be very careful. Almost every h addict thought it would not get them, but i promise you it will and the rest is history.&nbsp;

				Smoking it sucks if you don&#039;t know how, even a freebase veteran can end up wasting some.&nbsp; IV is the way, but a lot of people can&#039;t handle the idea because of their own trip.&nbsp; Hot railing (cook it up with water, draw it up into a syringe and spray up your nose as you snort the liquid) is pretty good, hard to waste.&nbsp; But the best route I know of, again, aside from IV, is to mix whatever you have with water until it is all dissolved, lay on your back and pour it into your nozz, and let your sinus cavities just soak it up.&nbsp; Try not to let it go down your throat, you may be laying there for a few minutes depending on how much water you use.&nbsp; But I tell you, this way, you do not waste a drop, and even if what you have doesn&#039;t last long, it will have some long ass legs this way.&nbsp; <br /><br />
