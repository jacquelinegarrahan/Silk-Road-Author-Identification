				Hello everyone I just purchased some synthetic cannabis off the road because I have to take a 6 week long drug course. What are the do&#039;s and don&#039;ts of this?

				I tried it once.&nbsp; It takes longer to kick in than you&#039;d expect, and can last longer than you want.&nbsp; YMMV<br /><br />Smoke just a little pinch, and wait a good while before smoking anymore.&nbsp; For me, it made me stoned, but not truly high.&nbsp; Its like fermented grape juice vs a fine wine.&nbsp; <br /><br />The people with bad experiences you may have read on Erowid all smoked too much.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t recommend it.&nbsp; But in your situation it might be all you&#039;re going to get for a while.

Don&#039;t underestimate the synthetic stuff. I had been toking the tried and true multiple times daily for about 15 years before I ever tried synthetics. But the first time I tried it, I took two measly hits of some (way too strong for me) blend which sent me into a panic attack of epic proportions. I had never in my life had a panic attack before this, to say it was scary is an understatement. My heart must have been pounding at 200bpm and I was almost positive I was gonna fucking die. <br /><br />So yeah, go easy on the stuff.

				Yes you will pass the test. That&#039;s why I&#039;m going to smoke it for this class I have to go to. Fucking bullshit they test me. I have to go to this class because I had a tiny bit of Alprazolam powder in my wallet.

Sock/Shoe or your vehicle, even a small jacket pocket would have given you a better chance of getting away. Well depending on the situation, but i feel that holds true for most.

				have you tried snorting Tramadol or Subutex? pretty sure neither show up on opiate or benzo tests, certainly not any THC!

				No the test tests for THC, Methamphetamine, E, Opiates, Cocaine, Benzos, and Barbiturates. Why would I be smoking synthetics if they didn&#039;t test THC?
