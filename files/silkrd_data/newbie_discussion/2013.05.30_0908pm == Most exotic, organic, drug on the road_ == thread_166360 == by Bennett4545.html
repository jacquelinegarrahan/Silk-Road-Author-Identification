				Love the Silk Road.&nbsp; Love that I get a Whole-Foods of new things to try.&nbsp; For example, psyched that I can get hash and opium.&nbsp; <br /><br />The road has a ton of stuff I&#039;ve never heard of, but it seems like most are synthetic or chemical based.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for something really exotic to try out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any suggestions?

				Yeah 2 to 6 hours of a heavy spiritual DMT trip...from what I&#039;ve read it&#039;s pretty extreme.<br /><br />I wonder how similar just adding DMT to an MAOI would be to taking true Ayahuasca.<br /><br />(Warning:&nbsp; MAOIs are super dangerous)

				They dmt+maoi in a capsule you are speaking off is commenly called pharmahyausca (I suck at spelling that lol) There are many different forms of it producing different highs, It appeals to me kind of cause I could imagine the real legit drink made by shamans and stuff tasting pretty nasty. But the drink would be much better for the &quot;cleansing&quot; aspect. Haha but when you say organic and exotic it just makes me think of some of the best medicinal marijuana money can buy ;p

				Ayahuasca doesn&#039;t taste that bad, kinda earthy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ground to powder and capsulated syrian rue before, it works. I took the capsules 30-45 min before taking the shroom capsules&nbsp; and definitely noticed the difference.<br /><br />As for the MAOI dangers, that&#039;s the synthetics you gotta worry about. The natural MAOI&#039;s, such as Harmine and even Theobromine in chocolate are RIMA&#039;s, reversible. They don&#039;t hang around to the point that you can&#039;t have a beer or eat some cheese. The shamanic types never worried about such things in Peru. Pharmaceutical anti-depressants ARE dangerous though.<br /><br />FYI, I&#039;ll have my vendor account up in a week or so. I specialize in organic/all natural psychedelics. Keep an eye out down the road for my shroom/san pedro chocolates. They deliver natural MAOI&#039;s, psilocybin, and mescaline while allowing the DMT native to the shrooms to be delivered as well. Quite the interesting experience if i do say so myself.

				Thank you PB for your insight.<br />And many thanks to Shaggy Shaman Id +1 you if I could<br />Its good to know the difference between synthetic MAOIs and RIMAs something I did not know before<br /><br />And I will be sure to keep and eye on the road for you, the combo of shrooms and san pedro is enticing.<br /><br />So chocolate has enough theobromine to work as a MAOI? maybe with DMT?

As for the MAOI amounts in chocolate, that&#039;s going to depend on the quality and how the chocolate was processed. Normal milk chocolate is very low in comparison to say Organic Peruvian Dark Chocolate 70%. Then I add some raw cacao nibs, which have LOTS of MAOI magic to them. For smoking DMT, you could eat a lot of dark chocolate and wait a bit, do some syrian rue, or use an extracted tincture of rue or caapi. <br /><br />As for doing Aya on your own, I wouldn&#039;t recommend you doing your first Aya experience alone. I know experienced Aya users who find the solo experience a quite frightening. Honestly, I would say the first time try to find an experienced guide. I can&#039;t stress enough the importance of having a REAL shaman holding the space you are in and facilitating the entire ceremony.

				Ayahuasca or Dmt is my vote. I have tried nearly all in the 2c series, shrooms, LSD, mescaline, MDMA, and Dmt. Nothing I&#039;ve tried is even similar to Dmt, and for many it can be a life changing experience.

				DMT.<br /><br />But remember: once you enter the DMT realm you never return back.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If you have read Castaneda is sort of like the Ixtlan metaphor of Genaro (it doesn&#039;t matter if Castaneda made up everything, that metaphor is still good).<br /><br />
