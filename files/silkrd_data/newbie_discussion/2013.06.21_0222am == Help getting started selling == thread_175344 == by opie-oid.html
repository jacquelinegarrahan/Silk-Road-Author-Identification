				I would like to open an account and start selling but i&#039;m seriously confused.<br />I know I need to learn how to use PGP. I know I need to buy enough bitcoins to open an account. I also need ship quickly and use stealth packaging. Is there anything else I need to do or any advice you can give so I don&#039;t fvck things up?<br /><br />Another thing so I will know how to price my items. How much is Silkroad going to take in commission and about how much do these bitcoin sites take in commission?&nbsp; I read where Silkroad takes 10% of your sales but is there any other hidden costs from SR or these bitcoins sites that surprised you? <br />Also lets say I have 50 bitcoins in my wallet and I want to convert all of them into cash. Is a $5K+ withdraw going to be a problem?<br /><br />Besides the Seller wiki is there any other info that&#039;s already out there that can help me out. I done a forum search and didn&#039;t come up with much.<br />I just need some basic info to get started and I can learn the rest as I go. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi and welcome. PGP is fairly straightforward, but as a vendor you will be dealing with it on pretty much every order so it&#039;s good to become proficient through practice.<br /><br />It really takes a good, saavy businessperson to be a good vendor. You have to manage all aspects just like any other business, but the customers are even more picky, and attention to detail for safe shipping is a must.<br /><br />There are people who will give you say moneypaks or other forms of stuff for bitcoins, or you can sell your bitcoins for that. But right safely extracting the BTC can be tricky in large amounts I would imagine.<br /><br />Of course you&#039;ll need supplies like dcn labels, valid (but not yours) return addresses for the packages, some way to print the shipping labels, etc.

				I have made my living selling on ebay for the last 10 years so I think I can handle the business end without any issues. <br />Sounds like I need to take a week or two and learn the bitcoin and pgp part of this if i&#039;m going to be able to get anything started.<br />You mention moneypaks. Add that to the list of stuff i&#039;ve never heard of before. Overwhelming to say the least.<br />Thanks for your input.<br />
