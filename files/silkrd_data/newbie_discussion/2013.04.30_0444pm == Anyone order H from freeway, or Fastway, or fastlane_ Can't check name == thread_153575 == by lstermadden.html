				Hey guys, I&#039;m a usual customer of Marlo when it comes to #4 heroin. On Sunday while Silk Road was running smooth and jolly, I was skimming the heroin listings for a new dealer to try out since Marlo was currently dry.<br /><br />Well I stumbbled upon this guy named Freeway, or Fastway or something similar who had a listing for &quot;1 gram of raw #4! DPR Respect Sale&quot;<br /><br />The price was still 225 a gram, but I figured I&#039;d give him a shot, he is fairly new with 16 total transactions, and people left good feedback. Since then I have managed to log in just Once and the order was still processing on Monday morning.<br /><br />Has anyone purchased from him before? Is his product decent? Did he send anyone&#039;s order out from the weekend? Does anyone have his tormail.<br /><br />Any input would be great! Let me know guys nd gals,<br />Lster

				I ordered quarter of his uncut/raw H yesterday. The order&#039;s still in processing, but it hasn&#039;t even been 24 hours, so I have nothing to complain about. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if anyone has sampled both of his H offerings (the raw/uncut and the cheaper, presumably more cut up version). I could have had a half gram of the latter for same price I paid for a quarter of the uncut, but I opted for quality over quantity. <br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to snort some up the &#039;ol tooter.

				I placed my order last Friday, the 26th, at noon EST and it still says processing. He PMed me Wednesday saying he was going to get all orders out by the end of the day. Since then he has been quiet, but still logs on daily. I&#039;m starting to get really pissed. Stretching my last bag as much as possible. Some of the reviews of other users have mentioned that they encountered really long delivery times and FREEWAY made it up to them by throwing in an extra gram. That is nice and all, but I don&#039;t feel a free gram warrants a 5 star review. When I look at who to order from, my first criteria is delivery time. If they can&#039;t get an order out 7 days after it was placed, their rating should reflect that so potential new buyers can decide for themselves if they want to gamble.

				hey guys... I am fed up with freeway. I ordered last sunday so I would def have my H by THIS weekend. But it was still processing. He said wednesday, then friday, then monday the latest. I just canceled and got my normal order from marlo. hes is and always will be my goto guy. it just sucks when his listing isn&#039;t up and i have to try out others such as freeway... I had hopes of the extra gram to keep me going, but if I knew i would have ended up canceling, i would have had an order in saturday!! i would have it by now :(

				Dude is a total scammer.<br />He has the same pictures of a vendor who was scamming last month. <br />I can&#039;t remember the name, sorry.<br />But unfortunately none of you will receive anything. <br />As long as you stayed in escrow you will only lose SR commission and whatever btc fluctuation occurs. <br /><br />Sorry guys

				Well ain that a MOTHERFUCKER!!<br /><br />godDAMNIT!!<br /><br />I just did a search for this asshole, and turned up this thread---<br />I am going through the EXACT SAME BULLSHIT as all of you guys...<br /><br />I ordered last thursday, he emails me saturday saying it got screwed up but he would ship monday--yesterday.. and still nothing. Nothing but promises of &quot;hoo-up&quot; and taking care of me for my trouble.<br />I chewed him out last night, and he replied that &quot;his guy&quot; left town before he could re-up, but he would get it this morning, and &quot;really take care of me&quot; today...<br />Guess what?? Its 9 pm and still processing... <br />The fucker has logged in, as you all know, but shipped nothing.&nbsp; <br />Oddly--he has reviews posted daily-even though there are no listings now..i am afraid i got scammed. <br /><br />FUCK!!<br />&nbsp;and just like a couple of you guys, i let myself run out of anything else, so now im starting to get sick.<br />If i dont hear something affirmative by about midnight--he is getting trashed in the H forum severely.

				lol you guys are really funny. for one if im a scammer i must be a computer programmer as well because i have alot of positive feedback so i guess thats made up. second ive done my absolute best to be honest and straightforward with everyone who placed orders with me. if the road wouldve never went down everyone would have been satisfied. all you guys have to deal with as customers is loading money and buying. as vendors we have to deal with HUNDREDS of msgs, safety, making every individual satisfied, and moving large amounts of money off the net and into our hands. this is hard work. i totally understand everyones disdain and it pained me to have people waiting. thats why i gave everyone the option to cancel and have there fees reimbursed or keep there listing and get hooked up. ive been a buyer on here for a long time and im used to getting 1.0 for a gram. i worked hard to make sure allll of my customers recieve more then what they paid for. check my reviews. for you to call me a scammer is totally slanderous and uncalled for. things didnt work out and im sorry for that but i guarantee you everyone who kept there listing is getting waaayyy more then what they expected, some people more then double. can any of you say you got looked out for like that? im not concerned with money i have over 35000 spent on my buyers account. money is no object to me, making people happy is. and thats what im going to do. so you guys can say what u want but my customers know whats up with me, and thats all that matters.

				Dear Freeway,<br /><br />It seems a lot of people tried to give you the benefit of the doubt as a new vendor, and I&#039;ve even heard that your product is pretty decent. But honestly, I think you bit off way more than you could chew. You&#039;re making honest gestures to satisfy those who are in waiting. There&#039;s a point where waiting becomes frustrating and that&#039;s what seems to be the general consensus here. Not all of us can afford to just wait AND place an order with another vendor, so, in the mean time; We get sick. That&#039;s the issue with being a heroin vendor, you&#039;ve got to remain consistent or at least keep people highly updated on situations that arise (good or bad) via your vendor page.

				i can&#039;t believe this guy freeway is on the 2nd page of the US domestic opiates page. He shouldnt even be on the list. I can&#039;t understand how this guy has so much feedback and even that he has a score of 100. Do you guys remember a couple months ago? When he had peoples orders held hostage for a little more then a month? <br /><br />I had 400 bucks tied up with him, and all I got as communication was a copy paste paragraph about how all orders will be shipped out tomarrow, tomarrow, tomarrow. Well you know what? Tomarrow never comes..<br /><br />He kept customers hanging on by saying that he will double the orders, and make up for the wait in weight. Which sounds AMAZING, unless you have no idea when your actually going to receive the product.. or if your actually getting sent the product at all. Luckily I got out of the wormhole when I did, but you all have been warned.<br /><br />I won&#039;t be buying from this guy, and i hope everyone knows the risk they are taking by placing an order with him. He has screwed people in the past.. A LOT of people.<br /><br />Thanks for reading guys, and happy purchasing!<br /><br />=Lster

				And lester Madden that is the reason you will never be able to buy anything from me. do you not remember the 2 weeks of downtime my first week of selling? do you not remember that everyone who was affected i double almost trippled there orders? i had listings for Cut dope for 125 and i gave everyone RAW and doubled them so some peopel made out with 400 dollars worth of product for 125. thats why im on the second page because i do good business and look out for my customers. thats why i have 100 next to my name asshole. stop bieng a hater and keep buying bullshit dope from whoever you buy from because you will NEVER Taste this excellent blow i have. and i have so much BANGING H that im not going to be on the second page for long buddy and everytime you go look for H you will have to see my Listings and Name and know deep down you will never be able to try it. do you know how hard it was during that downtime to conduct business let alone get any money out. shame on you for bieng such an Asshole i feel sorry for you. and usually im very professional but your comment just was so ignorant i had to reply. have a good day.

				Downtime or not, I gave you sooo much slack. After the 2 weeks downtime, you pulled me and a few others by the collers. <br /><br />On that Friday you said, &quot;All orders will be out saturday, and if not then definitally monday&quot;, Monday comes, no word, Tuesday comes, I send you a messege, you say that my order will be shipped tomarrow. I kept with u for another week, almost a WHOLE month having my money in escrow, AND I PAYED EXPRESS!!&nbsp; <br /><br />Me and a couple others were just waiting for the product because you were &quot;getting&quot; feedback saying that you double or trippled the quantity ordered! So That kept me waiting a little bit, cause extra is always good. Then after a total month, I had to cancel it.<br /><br />A Month and it wasn&#039;t put into transit. Really? <br /><br />And your communication totally died out. So If you want to badmouth me go right ahead, you will not be getting my money. <br /><br />I am a really good customer of H and C on the road, and I have my suppliers, But when I tried to venture and try someone &#039;new&#039;, you taught me a lesson. Stick with whats tried and true. <br /><br />ALSO <br /><br />I learned that even though u promised and kept saying &quot;ill double your order, tripple, i got fat bags, ill make it up to you&quot;, when it comes to a product like heroin, what you say only goes so far. If I don&#039;t get my product, then I get dopesick, my body can only take so much of me telling &quot;if we wait it out we will get more for free, just stay with it&quot;.&nbsp; Oh yea, the saying is, A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH 2 IN THE BUSH.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t know what happened to you that whole month, but if everyone is back up and running after a week and a half, then you have no excuse why you cant check your orders and get them out right away.&nbsp; The site was back, and all I herd from you is &#039;tomarrow, tomarrow, tomarrow&#039;. <br /><br />Stickin with my man MARLOOO. TYVM

				I placed my very first SR order with FreeWay, and everything was perfect.&nbsp; Did express shipping, the order arrived in 2 days, stealth was great, weight looked right (my scale&#039;s broken), and the quality of the H was absolutely mind-blowing.&nbsp; The warning label was well-deserved.&nbsp; Man, I&#039;m glad I don&#039;t inject, because that stuff could&#039;ve easily been lethal.<br /><br />He asked me to FE, since I had no stats.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to do this, but I did, and thankfully have no reason to regret it.&nbsp; I will never FE again for anybody, but I&#039;m glad I took the chance with FreeWay.<br /><br />Sounds like he had some problems when he first opened shop, but, judging from my experience, he has everything sorted out now and has gotten the hang of SR.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t hesitate to buy from him again.

His overnight is truly overnight too. DeluxeDelivery was ok on speed also. It took 4-5 days which is reasonable. Not sure if he is offering express or not now but his product was nice and he gave me a free bag as a new customer.

I asked her if she could buy my moneypak, and she said it was too small for her to do, but she referred me to another vendor.(can&#039;t remember his name).

				Honestly... i think we all (in the early thread) ordered from him when he was new, unprepared, and still a little unprofessional. i&#039;m not being a kissass at all here... I didn&#039;t appreciate my money being held up, while i got dopesick... but i did end up getting my money back, and Freeway has offered to make it right if i do decide to purchase from him again. from what i read on the forums as of late, it seems as though Freeway has gotten his shit together AFA the shipping times, and frankly i see such good reviews about the product itself, that i&#039;m considering giving him another shot based purely on that. it&#039;s not going to be when my getting sick or not depends on it, for sure... it&#039;ll be when i have a little cash and time to spare. and i sure as fuck wont FE... but i only ever have for one vendor and dont make a habit of it.<br /><br />the orders Freeway cancelled, did not get a chance to leave feedback. at the time, obviously i would&#039;ve left a 1/5 if given the opportunity -- which, if all the cancelled orders all left awful feedback, his rep would be ruined AS WELL AS all the customers refunded, which doesn&#039;t seem quite fair.. however neither was holding onto my money while i got sick. it pissed me the fuck off, yes. it was fucked up, yes. <br /><br />but as it stands, the vendors of REALLY GOOD DOPE are few and far between, which i think is why he&#039;s getting 5/5&#039;s right now.&nbsp; if the product is really that good, and he&#039;s improved his turnaround time and shipping and all that, i&#039;d be willing to give him a second chance. maybe i&#039;m more forgiving than i should be, but really, i&#039;ve been fucked over WAY worse by IRL dealers, and i don&#039;t really think it was all intentional. i think he was new, inexperienced selling things on the internet, and got in over his head at first. the general consensus seems to be, that that has improved. i think i actually am going to give him a try soon, given his new batch of dope gets the same rave reviews as the last.<br /><br />i&#039;m by no means trying to say, dont be pissed off. if i order from him, and i still get the same fuckaround, i&#039;ll come back here and spout off my ass about the unprofessionalism and whatnot -- believe me i will be the first in line. i&#039;m just not quite sure why this thread keeps being bumped about the same topic, when it seems like generally, the dude has cleaned up his act a bit. everyone was new at some point, and it seems like most new dope vendors either hit a few bumps in the road initially, or else magically fade away with a quickness... and if Freeway has that Fire that i&#039;ve heard he does, i&#039;d rather he didn&#039;t disappear, given he&#039;s wised up a bit on the ways of SR. i hope he has.<br /><br />of course if it turns out the feedback are just schills, i&#039;ll also be pretty damn pissed, especially since his prices have skyrocketed since i initially ordered. time will tell i suppose. i just can&#039;t spend my time being bitter over things that happened months ago, when there&#039;s such a shortage of vendors with really GOOD dope that isnt in stamps.

				plenty of others besides freeway, as i listed a page ago of very good venders. It makes me sick to know that all this happened a couple of months ago, and i see him on the 2nd page of opiate listings. he should be strait up out of biz IMO. You lie to your customers, you get in over your head, obviously you don&#039;t have what you need to be a vender on the road.<br /><br />If everyone can put out cheap prices, cancel half the orders, just to get there money up so they can buy more to sell, then I think there would be many more scammers on the road. This is exactly what he did though, and it shouldn&#039;t be forgotten. <br /><br />Wether he is 100% better then before, it doesn&#039;t erase the past. And I am just here to help him not forget what he did to those who put they&#039;re money and trust in him.<br /><br />He never offered to make it right, he kept lying through his teeth about my order getting shipped tomarrow, tomarrow, tomarrow, and then when i told him i was going to cancel, he said &quot;but if you wait you will get hooked up so much&quot;, yea right! I would still be waiting on his dope. <br /><br />&gt;_&lt; Sour, I am not going back to him after the shit he put me through, you can do what you want, but I will continue buying top quality dope from the venders IN THIS ORDER<br />-Marlostanfield<br />-Gotsitall<br />-SubsRGood<br />-DragonCove<br />-Maestro (Tried him out and his bags were snazzy!!)<br /><br />So having to stoop down to freeways&#039; level shouldn&#039;t be an option. I work hard for my money, and I don&#039;t want to get fucked around with. Enjoy your nods man.<br />

				Lster madden why are you so mad? why do you hate me so much? is it because i told you you couldnt order from me anymore? to everyone who had a bad experience months ago i am deeply sorry i use myself so i know the importance of fast shipping times. but also remember the first week of me selling SR was completely unreachable.at this time i had never been a seller but ive been a buyer for quite some time so i know when SR is down for maitenence it can be very tuff so 2 weeks of complete downtime would be tough on anyone even more so on a vendor. we cant reach our money things cant happen that we need to , we cant access information etc. to say im a scammer is complete bullshit and uncalled for because i never got one cent from you. you canceled and recieved your money back because the listing was hedged. people said that i took longer and doubled orders on the feedback because i did. theres no way i made up all that feedback and to say i did is completely crazy given the amount of money it would take for me to buy my own listings and leave my own feedback? that doesnt make any since at all. lster madden i dont hate you i actually like you because you like me so much that you just cant wait to come on here and talk about me. i may actually let u try some of this good H im nodding off right now. thank god for spell check lol. but seriously im truly sorry to everyone that experienced delays in the beginning. you have to understand i had grams for 125 of some good dope. of course that is going to be a surge of customers i had over 50 orders stacked up by the time i was even able to access my account. and i dealt with everyone in the order they were recieved and told everyone the truth. you decided to cancel lster i came to you as a man and told you about what was going on and told you i would double your order. to the people who stayed i did exactly what i said i was going to do. i even gave some people quadruple the value of their order. im a buyer first and a seller second. so i made sure to treat everyone like i would like to be treated in the situation. ive never had a vendor give me more then 1.1 when i was buying. i started out giving everyone 1.2+ even before the problems. because im trying to make the SR community better without looking at it monetarily. i really and truly believe in true customer satisfaction so im doing everything to make every transaction good. sorry i know i wrote alot but im a little high and was on a roll. have a good day lester madden no hard feelings.

				Why did you have to make a new forum account? You made your previous 2 posts as &#039;Freeway Vender&#039; And now you have a post from &#039;Freeway&#039;. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t take much money to FE your own listings, especially when you had listings for $0.00 Grams. Which is to show customers that you can get a free gram when you buy so many times.<br /><br />Honestly I don&#039;t believe you with what you say, no I am not jealous about not being able to order from you, because this controversy started 2 months before you made that statement. I have my trusted venders, and they know me as a very good reliable customer. You are not one of them. <br /><br />Your first week of business SR had downtime, ok? What about the next 3 weeks that you still couldn&#039;t get out an EXPRESS order lol Figure that out. Have a good one.<br /><br />If you were swamped when you started then you didn&#039;t deserve to be a vender. You never said anything like that. You said that our orders will go out today the latest, then the next day you said today, then the next day you said today. I think I still have the lies in my inbox.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t handle the heat, get out.<br /><br />-Lster

There have been multiple occasions when my &quot;go-to&#039;s&quot; have all been out of product at the same time, and since Freeway has good reviews regarding the service lately, and great reviews on the gear itself, i cant see the harm in giving myself another option for good H. i sincerely hope he comes through this time, as i&#039;ve put my faith in his word to make up for what happened last time, and placed a small order.

Never more than 1-2 hours...<br /><br />For myself, SRG is the only SR vendor that I&#039;m dealing with anymore..&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who is concerned about FE for him, put your nerves at ease because you have absolutely nothing to worry about.....&nbsp; You pkg will arrive and it will blow your mind....&nbsp; So, if you&#039;re trying to find a safe, reliable, and easy to get a hold of H vendor, the SRG is the way to go...<br /><br />

I don&#039;t really visit the forums much because most users don&#039;t even know what good dope is because they weren&#039;t even born when good shit flowed! <br /><br />But any vendor that requires FE is a fink! They shouldn&#039;t be allowed to even be a vendor! Any buyer who finalizes payments - when their stats show no auto-finalize/high refund % - shouldn&#039;t be punished because some idiot vendor either got burned or is just an arrogant prick/bitch of a vendor who somehow thinks they&#039;re all that and a milkshake - snap! <br /><br />I am sorry but I don&#039;t know how else to say it. I can&#039;t even count the times since joining that I&#039;ve read the whining, pissing and moaning about some vendor who fucked them when they FE&#039;d. I feel for them no less but STUPID FUCK! NEVER FINALIZE PAYMENT BEFORE YOU GET YOUR ORDER!<br /><br />No legitimate vendor asks for this. Legitimate vendors will keep lists of anyone who didn&#039;t finalize the day they got payment - YES - the day! and only those buyers will be required to FE. <br /><br />I do appreciate seeing this though because I was going to consider this punk before finding out about the FE. So many other good vendors here in Silk Road that never ask for FE. Makes me wonder what is wrong with those that continue to think FE&#039;ing is a show of respect for good and/or respected vendors. It is a stupid and ass kissing weakness of too many buyers. Your respected/trusted vendor would never ask you for this if they were any of that! <br /><br />Shrug?&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br />

				I&#039;ve ordered from him once. Decent shipping, stealth was ok, gear was pure fire. I mixed a quarter gram in with around 3/4 gram of lesser quality and it threw my GF to the floor. Super good shit.<br /><br />I know he had some issues in the past, many of them seem to revolve around the period the road was taken down, but those seem to be resolved.<br /><br />Currently waiting on the fe only discounted gram he was offering.

				Marlo,<br /><br />In my opinion, and I haven&#039;t started yet, but if I were to FE for a vendor, it would be because I&#039;d made several orders and they were all good, quick shipping, weight or prefer over (scams don&#039;t give away product.)<br /><br />I did FE for his discount because the price was some 50ish cheaper than normal and if it&#039;s as good as the last batch it&#039;s worth it. He has enough feedback lately to make me want to take the chance.<br /><br />Basically, if he consistently makes my GF happy (shit is for her) then I&#039;m happy and more likely to trust.

				Received my FE order yesterday, amazing dope and with the FE discount, the price is great. GF just went though 8 days of W/D to clear up the physical addiction so her tolerance is lowered but .05 of his dope blew her mind.<br /><br />Highly trustworthy vendor in my opinion.

				Yeah, I know I can get pissed off when something goes wrong, especially with heroin (that &#039;ol withdrawl monster lurking in the background) you gotta think before you stamp all over somebody&#039;s name. <br />Not to say that everything didn&#039;t happen the way he said it did, but sometimes you get an idea in your head and everything you see re-enforces it, and nothing anybody else says can change your mind. <br />It&#039;s easy to get &#039;spoiled&#039;-hell, I just found out about SR in February. I hadn&#039;t &#039;used&#039; in years, and didn&#039;t want to go out on the &#039;streets&#039; and try to score. <br />We get our drugs mailed to us, and from what I can tell, with very little LE risk. <br />I&#039;d think that if the guy got his money back, even though it took a &#039;month&#039;, it can&#039;t be that bad. I think that these vendors get a lot of people (FW said 120 email a day-that&#039;s a lot IMO)<br />Maybe Lester, you should get some suboxone.

				Already posted this in another thread but figured I would add it here too:<br /><br />Ordered late Thursday night/early Friday morning, shipped on Friday Priority Mail, received on Monday. Packaged inconspicuously with printed labels and layered well so no way to feel the product inside. Vacuum sealed one time in food grade bag. Product is brownish in color but shines and is extremely potent. On par with Subsrgood and Supremesmoke&#039;s quality, possibly a touch better. Overall extremely pleased with transaction due to Freeway&#039;s quick processing and very good product. The only room for improvement I can see would maybe be a switch to moisture barrier bag or another layer or two of vac seal, however I would not hesitate to buy from Freeway again because the package does not stand out and wouldn&#039;t be given a second look.
