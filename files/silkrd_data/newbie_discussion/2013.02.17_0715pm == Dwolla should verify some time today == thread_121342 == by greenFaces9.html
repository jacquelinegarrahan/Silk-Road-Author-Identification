Dwolla decided it wanted to make sure people were extra verified before they could send money to MtGox (for obvious reasons). That means you have to be verified in Dwolla to get money to your account, and then be verified with MtGox in order to send money directly from Dwolla to MtGox.&nbsp; There are two solutions:<br />1) Verify yourself with MtGox by sending them proof of residency (utility bills, etc.) as well as a photo ID (Drivers License/Passport). Note however that this means Dwolla and MtGox have your name, bank account number, social security number, date of birth, mailing address, etc. instead of just your bank account number.<br />2) Route the money through a third party (BitInstant) to circumvent this verification requirement because Dwolla will send money directly to BitInstant without a problem compared to MtGox.<br /><br />In the end, it comes down to your requirements for security. If you are okay with Dwolla and MtGox knowing all this extra information about you then you can go ahead and get verified. Honestly it probably does not matter that much since the bitcoins you buy will be put through a tumbler on SR anyway but it never hurt to be on the safe side.

It is possible they are going slow but it is most likely your verification got declined for some reason. You can probably check it under settings.<br /><br />Once you send money to MtGox and buy coins, click funding options -&gt; withdraw funds -&gt; bitcoins and enter the amount you want to send and the destination address. The destination address should be your SR bitcoin address found under &#039;account&#039;.

WOW . The reason being ? I&#039;m under 18 ... (17 years old)&nbsp; so now in order for that verification process to be completed they now need a PARENT&#039;s info .. Ha , that is definitely not happening.<br /><br />I am hoping BitInstant comes through with this glitch they are having very soon and it would make my life a lot easier.<br />Thank you for the help too avast I really appreciate it

				That&#039;s what I&#039;m saying.. when they ask for all of my info it&#039;s sketchy but I&#039;ll still take it.. but when they are asking for a parent/guardians info its getting a little out of hand at that point... Shit, I&#039;m getting into the BTC business and already got that far as it is when it came to their questions and requirements, I&#039;m using MY own bank information and MY own money. Pisses me off that they have to nerve to use that as part as their policy.. Whatever I&#039;m still stuck trying to find an alternative
