				So much paranoia here on the road that, me being a newbie is starting to freak me out as well haha. Having to get bitcoins (which is hard enough) /wash them and use pgp/gpg correctly. Personally I feel as a noob, that theres so much to do it is intimidating, to say the least. I also feel I should make sure the vendor is using hedge so I dont get screwed if BC bombs like it did a while back! <br /><br />Hm, thoughts and opinions please.

				I&#039;m in the same boat brotha!<br />1. How do we know we aren&#039;t buying from LE<br />2. It is pretty difficult to buy BTC (I&#039;m now buying mine from coinbase).<br />3. I have no idea how to wash the BTC (although I hear TSR does this for you?)<br />Number 1 scares me the most :P.<br />I&#039;m also not sure if using the current address I am at is okay or not. (if I use PGP or whatever it&#039;s called)...<br /><br />

				yea coming from a noob myself with only 4 transaction (almost $3000 though im pretty proud lol) the best advice i can say is do ur research. Make sure who ur buying from has good stats and great feedback, after all SR is primarily based on ur history lol.&nbsp; and about the bitcoin thing have u tried mtgox? its easy as hell. u can change ur money to bitcoins straight on there and from there to blockchain wallet and from there to SR. simple and completely anonymous 8)

				Lol I guess a little of it won&#039;t hurt. When I make a BoA or well&#039;s fargo buy for BTC, what info do I put in? like my name/address with the pgp. or my bank account info? Cuz thats risky. So but im such a noob. need a sure easy to comprehend up to date guide on best way to get btc, without a moneygram! and I need the posts so 2 birds with 1 stone I suppose!

				For me at least once I verified my info on MTgox (have to send them a utility bill and a copy of your ID)&nbsp; *not stealth at all*&nbsp; The only options I have for adding money to my account is by doing a Wire Transfer to Japan or Bitinstant.&nbsp; The only stealth way I think their is to get bitcoins is to buy from a private party off localbitcoins or mine them yourself.&nbsp; I just use coinbase personally.

				You could call it paranoia, but why not instead call it caution and good common sense? This is a cool thing here, but it&#039;s probably good not to lose sight of the fact that drug trafficking is illegal. So, how do you know you&#039;re not buying from LE? Well, you don&#039;t, I suppose. But you don&#039;t know that either when you&#039;re buying IRL. But one thing you do know is that if the guy selling you dope is a cop, he can reach right out and slap some cuffs on your ass. Which can&#039;t happen on SR, as long as you employ caution and good common sense.

				Do your research on your venders. Reading their reviews and checking the forums is the best way to determine if a vendor is legit or not. If your are nervous about your first order get some edibles or something inconspicuous. After that first order it is open season!&nbsp; :D

				Yeah, SR does have a steep learning curve, but that&#039;s a good thing. It helps to keep out really stupid people that would otherwise be a liability to the community as a whole.<br /><br />There&#039;s a sticky at the top of the Newbie forum where everyone can go to practice their PGP skills with each other:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0<br /><br />You can also pass your BTC through a fogging service like:<br />http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/

				I tumble mine through a couple of wallets before sending to SR, but yeah that&#039;s where I ended up as well. I consistently buy bitcoins every month and figure I can show enough &quot;legit&quot; uses for the coin from my &quot;legit&quot; wallets that I can talk my way through where some of them are going (receipts from legal online vendors, sending to friend, etc. etc.). <br /><br />Hopefully, I will never have to find out. Sure is a simple, quick&nbsp; process if you go for the level two tier, though. I can have bitcoins in my account within a couple of hours, after washing them through a few wallets.

Sure it&#039;s perfectly legal to buy the coin but as I&#039;ve very recently got into this I&#039;ve found that it&#039;s next to impossible to buy find a source WITHOUT going to the big guys like Mt. Cocks and giving ALL your fucking personal information.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s exactly the case. They can&#039;t really stop us by any other method, so they brought the hammer down on the ways that we get money into and out of the system.

This is a cool thing here, but it&#039;s probably good not to lose sight of the fact that drug trafficking is illegal. So, how do you know you&#039;re not buying from LE? Well, you don&#039;t, I suppose. But you don&#039;t know that either when you&#039;re buying IRL. But one thing you do know is that if the guy selling you dope is a cop, he can reach right out and slap some cuffs on your ass. Which can&#039;t happen on SR, as long as you employ caution and good common sense.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>wise words
