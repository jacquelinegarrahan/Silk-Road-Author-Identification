				Its a reputation type system. Some message boards have them. Basically the higher positive rep you have the more &quot;quality&quot; your posts are.<br /><br />Personally, I think the whole system is garbage, but whatever.

				I know it&#039;s all anonymous etc..&nbsp; but I do sometimes think it&#039;d be nice to know which posts you made were responsible for the + or -. Not interested in who awarded points, but it&#039;d be nice to know which posts people find useful, or not.<br /><br />It really does mean nothing. Still nice to see it go up. Admit it. lol

Any kind of info re: why you get points, would just plunge the whole system into a big pool of nonsense.<br /><br />So.... yeah... ..forget everything I said. lol
