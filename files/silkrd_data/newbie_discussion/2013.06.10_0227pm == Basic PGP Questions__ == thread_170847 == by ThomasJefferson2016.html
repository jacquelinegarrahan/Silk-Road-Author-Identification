				Title: <strong>Basic PGP Questions??</strong><br />

				I am a noob on Silk Road and on using Tor and the deep web in general. I have downloaded Tor Browser and Portable PGP.<br /><br />My question is, why do all vendors have their Public PGP Code on their profile page without disclosing their passcode. What is in this Public PGP code that ALL the vendors have their own code. Is it contact information for the vendor, and how do you decrypt the code when they offer up NO password for the PortablePGP application.<br /><br />So what is the Public PGP code for that all the vendors post to their pages and how do you decrypt them without passwords?<br /><br />Another question regarding Portable PGP and passwords is, when you send the encrypted coded message, do you send the password with it, because it seems very counter-productive to go through the trouble of encrypting the message into a code and then sending your password along with the code itself.<br /><br />I am basically just wondering how to use this PGP and use it effectively. I do not want to get caught up in some bullshit so I am taking steps to prevent that from happening, but I am still unsure about how to use PGP to contact people and the channels i need to go through to successfully send a message.<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advanced guys.

				dont fret it took me some time to figure it out also. I use GNU and this is how it works for me. A vendors public key is copied to a standard txt file and then saved, i open my GNU and choose import key, select their txt file with their public key in it and import. at this point a new key is available with their name associated with it.Once that is done i open clip board and write a message and choose to encrypt<br />using their key i imported and wham the message is ready to send to them.copy the message, go to their page and click send message and paste the message in the box.<br />Always use this when sending out your shipping information.<br />Your passcode is just for you, never give yours out and you will also never receive anyone elses.You do not need theirs and vis versa to encrypt or decrypt<br /><br />Hope that helps, im new to but i tried to make it simple, go to the PGP club and Paste your key on the board and ask for anyone to message you. I did that and got a lot of help to all my troubles.<br />Safe travels

Sounds simple enough now, just add their Public Key to my Keyring on Portable PGP and I should be able to do what I need to do. Thanks a lot.

				You don&#039;t need to use a text editor.&nbsp; There is one built into the pgp program.&nbsp; Just copy a vendor&#039;s public key to the clipboard; in the program, hit import key-&gt;import key from clipboard, or something like that.
