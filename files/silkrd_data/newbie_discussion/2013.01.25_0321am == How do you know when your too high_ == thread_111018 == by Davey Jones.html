				The most high I ever was was a few years back when I went a few days without sleep w/ heavy alcohol consumption on top of the drugs. Ended the night by sitting staring at a wall for 3 hours begging my drunk ass friend to call an ambulance.

				DAE only ever try to get the best money/highness ratio? I like a little of this and a little of that, but I don&#039;t want to stress my body or my wallet more than I have to.<br /><br />I hear this term, &quot;faded&quot; used by my peers. They like to spend all their money in getting high for one sitting. What the fuck?!<br /><br /><br />I prefer to get to a comfortably strong high, and save the rest of the product for the future. Pretty much every drug is subject to diminishing returns. Whats the point in paying double for only 20% more high?

				there is no such thing as too high!<br /><br />if you ever experienced ego death then you would know that.<br /><br />If you do not want to experience that then better not touch psychedelics at all.<br /><br />If you are asking &quot;how do you know that you have overdosed&quot; then it will depend on the substance.

				How to know when your too high 101 weed:<br />-When your smoking a joint and you fall a sleep with the joint still on.<br />-When after you take a bong hit then spit on the floor instead of going to the balcony like your friends asked you to do.<br />-When you are smoking a dubie in the middle of the night after half an hour of smoking you realize the joint is still in the middle are you are already too much fucked up to smoke it until the end but you finish it anyways.<br />-When you are on the state of mind wondering if you will puke if you take another bong hit. <br />-When you are paranoid thinking people know you are high and you try avoid looking them in the eyes.<br />-When you are smoking with a friend and both of you get lost in the topic of what you were talking about and proceed with the usual stoner attitude stoner 1 what? stoner2&nbsp; what what?<br />stoner1 idk what i was talking about stoner2 lol me neither fuck it let&#039;s roll another one.

				Most of the time I know when I&#039;m getting too high. I always get hot, sweaty flushes over my skin and a lump in the back of my throat a couple of doses before getting &quot;too high&quot;. A lot of the time I get a real craving for water as well. It starts as a thirst but turns into a craving, and satisfying it with cool water going down one&#039;s throat feels amazing, especially to soothe after a harsh coke drip. One of the beauties of taking small doses as I do, especially when insufflating, is something that&#039;s been said a million times but I&#039;ll reiterate; you can always do more but you can never do less!<br /><br />- JH<br />
