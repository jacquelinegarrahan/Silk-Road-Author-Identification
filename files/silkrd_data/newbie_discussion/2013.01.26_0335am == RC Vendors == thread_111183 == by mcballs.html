				Here&#039;s a big thread with tons of RC vendors:<br /><br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13078.0<br /><br />Make sure to always check vendors with SOS, and keep in mind that your private information will be WAY less secure than if you bought through a site like SR. I&#039;d advise any small-time buyers to stick with vendors here, even if it costs a little more. You can&#039;t put a price on your liberty!

				Yeah I&#039;ve seen that thread. Was just making an equivalent one here in the mean time. I agree that it is a little risky from clearnet vendors but SR doesnt have quite as much on offer as the clearnet suppliers and SR prices are higher mostly.

I would love to find some LSD analogs too, although the nbomes are some interesting chemicals. Only thing I can get is impure LSA which I extract myself. Not that I&#039;m complaining, its really good ;)
