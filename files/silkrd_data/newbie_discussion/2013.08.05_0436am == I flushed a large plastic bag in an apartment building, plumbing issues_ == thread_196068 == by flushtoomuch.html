				I flushed a half sandwich bag full of individually bagged grams of mdma caps because of a false alarm with polic in my apartment complex that had nothing to do with me.&nbsp; I&#039;m an idiot.&nbsp; Paranoia got the best of me when I was startled awake by an unpleasant noise outside my window split second reaction that cost me a bunch of money.&nbsp; I took it as a clue that I&#039;m not cut out for this and don&#039;t plan on making any more orders.<br /><br />Now, a week or two later, I&#039;m realizing that the sewage system probably isn&#039;t set up to handle that kind of load and that it may be caught in a filter.&nbsp; Does anyone know enough about plumbing to suggest how I might prevent the pills from popping up if the shit clogs sometime soon?&nbsp; My worst case scenario mind is imagining the bags all in tact with my fingerprints on the individual pills.&nbsp; It&#039;s a small apartment building surrounded more small apartment buildings in a large American city if that helps at all.<br /><br />

				You think a cop is gonna try to pull prints from a bag thats been in the shitter? Even if that was possiible no cop cares about his job that much haha. Even if they got your prints they would need a suspect to match them to. If someone finds the bag i doubt there gonna open it up... Theyll just toss it.<br />Have your pipes been backed up? sounds like your in the clear man.

				With the other people living in my apartment building, I would be the obvious suspect.&nbsp; I agree that I&#039;m being hyper paranoid but I would love if someone with an understanding of plumbing could chime in with some specific knowledge on the subject.<br /><br />And no, no new problems with the pipes.&nbsp; They&#039;re pretty shitty to begin with though.

				Who individually bags caps? sort of makes putting drugs into the caps redundant dont you think?

				Multiple caps per bag, that was poorly worded.&nbsp; They&#039;re MUCH easier to count that way.

				No i got that i was assuming 10 to a bag as in .1 in each but still seems silly 1 you are clearly going to sell them if individually bagged 2 how often did you have to open a bag or did you only sell whole bags
