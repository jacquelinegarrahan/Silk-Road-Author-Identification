				IMHO Alex Jones is a complete asshole. I understand the cause he fights for etc and I love my own personal freedom, but I think he speaks a lot of shit as well.<br /><br />He lost all credibility during the &#039;debate&#039; he was supposed to have with Piers Morgan regarding gun laws in the USA. He just shouted over Piers Morgan each time he spoke and he made an absolute idiot of himself.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents...

				I don&#039;t think he is discredited for being mad and passionate about our gun rights. I think more people need to do that, I&#039;m tired of all the squishiness in this country, at first I felt the same way when I saw the interview but more I got to thinking, we need more men to be men in this country and stand up and fight to get our country back, both from the neo con republicans and the communist dems. And thats just my 2 cents, but you do make a point still he prob went a little too far in that interview but its better than laying down and taking it from these people who are trying to keep us under their thumb

				The gun rights/laws in Europe are very different and our murder rates etc are far lower. People don&#039;t feel the need to carry guns here. At least the vast majority of people don&#039;t anyway. The US has gone too far now, in my opinion, so to revoke the gun laws would be next to impossible. Basically, we don&#039;t live in fear in the same way that people do in the US. Please don&#039;t perceive this as a condescending comment towards the US. I am just making an observation based on my experiences in both Europe and the US.<br /><br />Back to Alex Jones; he didn&#039;t make one valid point in that interview, he is aggressive, he doesn&#039;t know how to listen, he embellishes a lot of what he says and makes it sound like he is stating facts. He is not the kind of person I would want to be negotiating on my behalf.

				Wow, just watched the Morgan vs Jones &#039;debate&#039; on youtube (which i never saw before) and ... AJ is an asshole. He was very immature and probably lost a lot of supporters and respect.<br /><br />I kind of can&#039;t blame him because he is upset, he is not just another actor for the mainstream media and he speaks very passionately because the things he talks about are near and dear to him but he should have been more professional.<br /><br />People thought Jefferson, Revere, Washington and Franklin were assholes during their time too though. Just saying.

				The arguments that Morgan makes have a very limited scope, are inconsistent and are fueled by emotion, rather than logic. As a pro gun person myself, I will admit, Jones could have done much better, but despite his aggressiveness, he does make a valid point; our guns will not be taken away. The fact that all of these mass shootings have taken place in &quot;gun-free zones&quot; is, in my opinion, the biggest flaw of Morgan&#039;s argument, along with the inexperience and lack of general firearms knowledge. He interviewed a lot more people on this argument, and I must agree that he does in fact &quot;stand on the graves&quot; of the victims. Piers refuses to say anything about people whom have died from knifes, bats, and even overseas drone strikes. He also claims people should have a right to defend themselves, but not with &quot;assault weapons.&quot; <br /><br />I could go on and on, despite some of these right-wing people making asses of themselves on television, Piers is fighting an uphill battle and obviously does not understand how prevalent guns are in the USA. Either way, federal gun legislation failed, and the NY SAFE ACT has been voted to be repealed in nearly all counties in NY, except NYC.

I don&#039;t love the things though),&nbsp; I can see where you&#039;re coming from. However, it is naive to think &quot;our guns&quot; couldn&#039;t be taken away if the government really wanted them to be taken away, and enacted legislation as such (especially during wartime). Despite what some individuals like Jones might think, it&#039;s not 1776 anymore. It&#039;s not, &quot;We have muskets and some guys, but the British have muskets and MORE guys.&quot; The level of technology the government has at their disposal FAR outweighs the average citizen&#039;s. Practically speaking, they CAN do what they want, for the most part. This is why you get things like police brutality with no accountability - OUTRIGHT, IN PUBLIC, SEVERAL WITNESSES, TAPED EVEN, and still no accountability. But since the government is so diverse, made up of so many heads, it is highly unlikely that the majority would be in agreement on anything as controversial as total gun control, so that is unlikely to happen. However, I&#039;m saying, if the government did somehow come to the appropriate consensus on a gun control bill (I forget the numbers required, senate majority and 2/3 house to pass into law?), they could enact it into law, and do some serious damage before the SC caught up with them, IF the SC wasn&#039;t also corrupted. The president is not even a factor - he&#039;s compromised. And I don&#039;t mean that like &quot;its a conspiracy maaan.&quot; I mean he obviously could give two shits about the constitution. <br /><br />So yes, &quot;our guns&quot; can be taken away. I assume it would involve a public official (probably a cop) visiting every home. They would not enter your home, under the guise of giving a shit about constitutional rights. They would request you relinquish all firearms in the home under the unconstitutional law; if you refused, you would be detained, arrested, and charged with violating the law, probably along with some other fabricated crap like obstruction. That would then give the officials probable cause to search your home, and seize your firearms. This would happen. You would not shoot at the police. And, assuming you were crazy enough to, which you&#039;re not, your&nbsp; life would be over. Move onto the next one. And I guarantee every well-behaved American would relinquish their firearms like good little boys and girls, and possibly take it up the ass from cops if that was included in a subsection of the law. You might hear about a shootout or two on the news, but overall it would go according to plan. America&#039;s been compromised since the Patriot Act. Pack your shit and move to Canada/Europe if you have any self-respect.

				there are over 300 million guns in usa.if outlawed,about 50% would be turned in (voluntarily).<br />the remaining halve would become very expensive.again rewarding people who break bad laws.

				I used to listen to a lot of Alex Jones but now I don&#039;t really bother. He sees a conspiracy in EVERYTHING. Though he is certainly right about some things, you can&#039;t claim that everything is some crazy government control event. They simply don&#039;t have that much power over the chaos of our system. When the Boston attack happened he pointed fingers at the government before ANY of the facts were in. The bottom line is he is happily making money off of making a fuss about everything and anything that could be a conspiracy. I do respect him for sticking it to the man and defending personal liberty.

				Alex Jones is a disinfo agent working for the Zionists/Illuminati. His wife is a polish jew.<br /><br />That CNN interview with Piers Morgan, Alex intentionally acted like an idiot in order to discredit the conspiracy movement. He acted like a complete fool because HE WAS ORDERED TO DO SO.<br /><br />Most people already figured out that Alex is a disinfo agent.
