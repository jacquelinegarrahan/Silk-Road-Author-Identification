				When you decide to &quot;finalize&quot; an order it will take you to a site where you will be able to give 1 to 5 stars, 5 being the best as well as an empty field where you can leave your feedback. Remember never to finalize early to avoid scams.

				well actually i am buying bitcoins.. and i have 0$ in my acct. so what he did was made his posting 0.0$ so i can add it to my cart and purchase it.. I then sent him the info on the card which was a reloadit car. it was only $250, as a test run. He hasnt been back on yet, but the card still has the money on it ! and my messages are unread. I dont think he is scamming me at all. but im wondering where it is to leave feedback. when i goto my order it shows in order from left to right (tx#,item,quantity,seller,status,auto finalize,cancel) i can click on the tx#, item, and seller.. but that doesnt do anything to leave a feedback. thanks for your input! --theHIGHpriest

				You get to leave a review when you finalize it. Don&#039;t FE until you get the bitcoins in your account.<br /><br />That said, it usually takes a few hours for Bitcoins to arrive in a SR account because they have to be confirmed. Then they have to go through the tumbler, and so on, and so on.

				Buying BTC as a new user of SR is very risky but fingers crossed that everything goes well.<br />I would recommend that you take a look into localbitcoin.com. It is easy to use and uses an escrow system that you cannot have with money transaction on Silk Road.<br />The problem with leaving feedback is that the product is probably still &quot;processing&quot; am I right?<br />As soon as the order goes into transit you will be able to &quot;finalize&quot; as in this picture<br />http://i.imgur.com/tgLqYAg.png (Clearnet link)
