				Never had this happen with normal mail but have noticed a couple of orders have come with quite a big tear&nbsp; in one corner. As if someone has opened it to look in.<br />Nothing was taken but seems funny its happened twice now. has never happened with normal mail.<br /><br />Anyone else noticed this before? Could be me getting a bit paranoid of course!

				Yeah it&#039;s happened to me before, it was a larger order, looked like it had been glued back together. <br /><br />It freaked me out a bit but nothing has happened and that was a while ago.
