				Yes I can remember it clearly, like it was yesterday. The day my first order arrived and opened my eyes to something incredible!<br /><br />Any day a nondescript unsuspected package arrives is a good one in my book ;)

Luckily they did! I got my packages today and was super excited about it! Haven&#039;t used any of it (yet) but I can&#039;t wait to give the cheeba chew a try and I&#039;ll probably take half an oxy tonight when the pain starts to get worse :-) At least my stuff will be managed for a little bit now.<br /><br />I guess the trick to being new is to only order a little bit and whatever you get you should be OK with it getting lost in the mail or losing it!
