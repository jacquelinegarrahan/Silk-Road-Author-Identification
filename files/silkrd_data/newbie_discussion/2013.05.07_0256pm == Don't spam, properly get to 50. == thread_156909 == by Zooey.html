You should report him or her. <br /><br />But remember to not yell wolf before you&#039;re absolutely certain that you&#039;ve actually been scammed. People who think they&#039;ve been scammed because a package didn&#039;t arrive the day that was expected doesn&#039;t mean that the vendor is a scammer. It could also be the postal services that messed up, or the package is just one day late.<br /><br />So be careful not to yell wolf too early. But still make sure that others are warned if it&#039;s a scammer =)

				It really is not as bad as it seems. The general idea is for newbies to be able to learn without cluttering up the rest of the forum. 50 may be a bit much, but it also serves as a spam blocker. <br /><br />I joined the forums as a newbie, even though I had plenty of experience on the main site. I spent my first 50 posts answering questions and providing guidance to newbies. I still occasionally pop down here to see if there is anything I can help with. <br /><br />If you have something you want to be seen in the main forum, such as reporting a scammer, you can post it here and then request that it be copied over to the main forum by someone else.

If someone want to spam 50 posts, I don&#039;t have any problem with it at all. As long as it doesn&#039;t affect threads where people are trying to have serious discussions :)

				Quite annoying trying to spam in the designated &quot;spam&quot; threads when it takes you 20 minutes to get 1 post due to the &quot;While you were typing X amount of people have replied in this thread etc etc&quot;.<br /><br />First world problems, I suppose.

				People will still spam just this way it takes them longer to get the privileges to do so.<br /><br />I believe you should be judged on the merit of your opinion not the amount of posts you&#039;ve made.<br /><br />But my way would require more managment from mods etc. So its understandable that theyuse this system.
