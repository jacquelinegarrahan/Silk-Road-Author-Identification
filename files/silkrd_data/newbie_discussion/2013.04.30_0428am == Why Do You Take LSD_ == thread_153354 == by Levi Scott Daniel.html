				Just something to do while SR is down. Since SR is worldwide I would love to hear some detailed responses on why people take LSD. The reason I do is not more-so the effects. I feel like LSD &quot;opens&quot; my mind. It doesn&#039;t make me smarter. But i feel like i know everything. I can go out and watch people and I can see past the charades and into their lives as to how they are. It makes me feel like i have powers.&nbsp; Basically the reason I take it is because I feel that it takes off the &quot;human&quot; restrictions in my brain.

				To me it takes me to a place that reminds me of being a kid.&nbsp; It really highlights the insignificance and utter upsurdity of things I spend a great waste of time thinking of.&nbsp; Simple response but I think it sums it up.

This is what I believe... Kids &quot;innocence&quot; is from them not fully immersing themselves in the world. And growing up in the world your brain naturally puts blocks on certain receptors so you loose your &quot;innocence&quot;. LSD &quot;opens&quot; your brain by &quot;unblocking&quot; all of those &quot;blocked&quot; receptors. Therefore puts you in a place of being a &quot;kid&quot;. That is why you see everything more &quot;detailed&quot; or &quot;clear&quot;. Do not be brainwashed. TAKE LSD!!!!!&nbsp; :D

				Lsd has reformed my life and who Iam inside and out. Its made me a better person in many aspects as well as opened my mind and made me more free. Lsd is like a epiphany, a religious experience, one that you cant put into words after its happened but makes so much sense while your on it like living in a contradiction. You&#039;ll know this feeling when you leave your body and join the source, its being every thing at one time for what seems forever while you disappear for only a few minutes. I continue to take acid in aim to reach an enlightened state to finally come to complete peace with my internal demons. I know its working like a holy water for the soul slowly cleansing out the evil and ignorance.<br /><br />Also I like to see fucked up shit that make eyelids do backflips and it enhances music far better then any thing else.

Just let them do their thing and once they experience that deepness they will understand lsd is not a fucking toy.

Who are you to classify what LSD &quot;comes down to&quot;? LSD is deeper than what you see brother. Keep looking. Don&#039;t stop.

				No, but seriously. <br /><br />I take acid because, without trying to sound like I&#039;m escaping reality, it helps me come to terms with how I&#039;ve taken part in the direction of my life. It helps make crappy situations into really fucking good ones, and it re-enforces my confidence in what my mind is capable of. When I begin writing trip reports DURING a trip, it always re-amps my self-esteem and faith in my own mental capacity and understanding of how much responsibility I actually hold.<br /><br />For me it isn&#039;t spiritual, it really just boosts my inner thoughts and allows me to take an introspective journey purely on how much I enjoy what is already inside my own head with or without the drug.<br /><br />That, and heavily contrasted colours and bright lights are COOL AS SHIT. <br /><br />No come down<br />No hangover<br />No bad vibes<br />No paranoia<br />No nausea<br />No anger<br />Cheap as hell<br />No taste<br />Lasts for a really, really long time<br />Can take you into outer space<br /><br />What sane person would ever not want to do this drug

				I have not done it in many years. Did it a bunch of times when I was younger. Definitely changes how you view the world, in a good way. However, it most definitely definitely is not a toy. I remember taking a little too much on two separate occasions and it was not much fun during peak time. <br /><br />I have done the other traditional psychedelics like peyote (a couple of decades ago when it was easy to find,) and shrooms. I have not done any of the newer ones (newer for me). For example, I have read some stuff in the forums and elsewhere recently about 2c-b which sounds very compelling. 25i-nbome sounds like you need to really understand what you are getting into, even more than LSD, which you definitely need to understand what you are getting into.<br /><br />Does anyone have any opinions to share about the &quot;newer&quot; psychedelics, in addition to LSD?

Some of them are actually very good, comparable to lsd. It would completely fool you if you didnt know you were in fact not taking lsd and not experienced with the difference. Id say some of these may actually be stronger then lsd, not dose wise but in a sense of comparing the heavy end of the trip. You need to be extremely careful with these, if you want to get into them Id suggest a really good high quality scale. be extremely cautious with liquid measurement conversion. First of all do lots of research on trip reports in different measurements for the chem your most interested. It could save your life.
