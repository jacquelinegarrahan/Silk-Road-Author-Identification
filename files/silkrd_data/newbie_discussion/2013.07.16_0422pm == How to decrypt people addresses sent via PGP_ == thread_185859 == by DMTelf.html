				I&#039;ve been given a series of address, which I presume have been encrypted by using my public key. I&#039;m not sure how I go about decrypting them however? I&#039;m using thunderbird and enigmail on a mac ...

				Copy and paste the encrypted message to the clipboard. Then click DECRYPT. Enter your Private key (password) which you would of created initially when generating your Public Key.

				Hmm I have copied the message to my clipboard but the decrypt option in thunder-bird is greyed out ... do I have to save it as a text file in text edit and import it and decrypt it in that way? I really can&#039;t see how to do it.

				Yuna, that&#039;s probably because he said he has a series of addresses. It&#039;s a little strange to have a series before they learned to decrypt. Looks like you&#039;ll be good now!

				Bump. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if im being retarded but in thunderbird there seems not to be an option to decrypt a message ... there is a decrypt button but it&#039;s greyed out unless I open a message in my inbox. The addresses have been mailed to me by users that used my public key to create them but I honestly can&#039;t see an option to paste a message into thunderbird then decrypt it ...

				It&#039;s looking like it&nbsp; &gt;:( What I&#039;ll do in a bit is start a thread for users that use OSX for PGP to comment, as I have to use this OS as i&#039;m using a a hackingtosh (fuck buying a mac! I&#039;ve got a PC 10x faster than any mac on the market) and I appreciate that most users here either use linux or windows. So with a better title hopefully I&#039;ll attract more suitable people to help me. <br /><br />This hackintosh is amazing at mining bitcoins though, I&#039;ve got more power under this hood than most gamers have, so I absolutely rinse the MAC mining pools.

				do you have gnupg installed? if yes you can decrypt via the command line just as you could on linux. don&#039;t save the text document as .rtf, save it as .txt. that was why you couldn&#039;t decrypt. you can send yourself an email with the encrypted message and if you have thunderbird and enigmail set up properly you should be able to decrypt it that way although that&#039;s not really how you&#039;re supposed to do it lol
