				Order never arrived, doesn&#039;t come up with tracking number.. Makes false allegations, outright unpleasant, unprofessional and unreasonable! He recommends himself with the following message:&nbsp; &quot;Hey SR! I am CannabisArbiter. I grew up in Southern California, and am now finishing my Chemistry degree in Northern CA. I think I could bring some really great concentrates and flowers to the menu here.&quot; This webpage is all about trust and goodwill.. well this boy &quot; CannabisArbiter &quot; or CannabisArbiter(97) as he calls himself is to my opinion the total contrary of everything this webpage ( SR ) stands for.I FEEL CHEATED, MISTRUSTED AND OUTRIGHT OFFENDED BY THIS VENDOR, ACCUSING ME OF THE FOLLOWING: &quot;Especially considering your high refund rate, it appears to me that you purposly delayed this resolution so that it would be particularly difficlut for me to find your tracking number and prove that your order was indeed sent ... and I do recall asking for your address after you requested an extention and did not receive it until just 4 days ago.&quot; ALL THIS IS UNTRUE AND RIDICULOUS. And what really offended me the most was his &quot; gipsy &quot; kind of proposal to come to a resolution by offering to resend part of the order!! I DON&#039;T CARE ABOUT MONEY, I CARE ABOUT HONESTY AND MY REPUTATION. No matter how long this man has been selling here and how positive some of his clients seem to be: SOMEONE WITH THIS TYPE OF CONDUCT SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SR AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED! <br />
