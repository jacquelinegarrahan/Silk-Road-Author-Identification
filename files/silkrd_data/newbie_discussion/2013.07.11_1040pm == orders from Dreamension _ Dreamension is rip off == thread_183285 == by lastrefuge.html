				Just curious if anyone else has an order not filled ? I purchased 1g of the mdma early last week and still no product. I had also purchased from Blueviking and elvis at the exact same time and those items arrived last week. I deliberately ordered domestic to avoid any &quot;problems&quot; with customs plus I wanted it fairly quickly (kiss that goodbye, wife will be back home Saturday}.<br />I understand they must get a lot of messages, but I believed enough time had passed so yesterday I pm&#039;d him and never got a reply. Today I got a message from silk road saying it would auto finalize unless I had a problem, so I did the &quot;resolve&quot;. Tho it was today, it was pretty early and still no response ?<br />I have lived in the same house for over 20 years and as far as I know, I have only had one piece of mail delivered to the wrong address and that was thru DHL, the only time I have ever dealt with them. I live in a small town and know the mail person well and i just never have any problems when it comes to that.<br />&nbsp;Last month I made a $100 purchase from a reputed vendor overseas and it never arrived either. The vendor was great about it, responded quickly etc. As he is a very, very reputable vendor, I had no doubt the shipment was made so even tho he offered a refund, I figured it got tied up or stolen in customs , so not his fault, and being fairly new, I didn&#039;t want a refund showing up on my purchasing stats because many vendors hold that against you (I understand why, but sucks when it is legit).<br />I also figured since I had no doubt he shipped it, there wasn&#039;t a need for both of us to take a hit (50% refund I believe) so I thanked him and told him not to worry about it......<br /><br />so my next order I made sure it was domestic so I wouldn&#039;t have any problems. I guess at least I got 2 out of 3.....<br />I understand there is an inherent risk when purchasing from silk road, but I really can&#039;t afford to be losing $100 or so every time I order something. <br />As I have not heard back from dreamension, I was wondering if anyone else was having problems.<br />I had to post this here because I am not sitting in front of my computer for an hour (really slow connection) trying to get my post count up....

				Hi, <br /><br />check his page. He has more than 200 PM&#039;s to answer... <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had problems with him and I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll sort things out with you (I&#039;m very sorry your Missis is coming back that early...can&#039;t you suggest her to go spend another week at her mothers?). <br /><br />Just 1 small thought: why is everyone ordering domestic and assuming it&#039;s safer? <br />I prefer to order international, at least that way I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not ordering from an undercover agent in my own country... (hehe, just to f*ck with your mind a bit). <br /><br />Remember: when you send a PM to someone, do put something in the title, not just let it &quot;empty&quot;. Those messages with a &quot;title&quot; attract much more attention and get a quicker reply.

				as for ordering overseas...my 1st 3 orders were made overseas, all from very reputable, highly spoken of vendors. I only got 2 out of the 3 orders so I ended up losing about $120.00. The vendor was great and offered me a 50% refund pretty much instantly, but after thinking about it, I had no doubt he mailed it and having made so few purchases, I didn&#039;t want a refund on my purchasing stats already, so figured since I was fairly positive he did mail it, just decided to eat the loss, figuring it was just the cost of sitting at home making these kinds of orders.<br />&nbsp; Besides that, the only other thing was it did take 10 days or so to get here. Not really bad at all, but on my next 3 orders I wanted everything right as the wife was leaving, so I went domestic. I also figured no way anything could get lost in the mail. I have lived here for 20+ years and to the best of my knowledge, only one piece of mail has ever went to the wrong address and that was a DHL delivery.<br />&nbsp; So I was thinking domestic would be faster, plus as I had just eaten around $120, much safer (I still have no doubt the vendor mailed it and again, he answered my pm very fast and without hesitation offered me a 50% refund, which seems standard, so he was excellent about it)<br />&nbsp; As previously mentioned, I ordered 2 other items besides what I ordered from dreamension and they arrived that same week. I ordered everything on a sunday. The order from Blueviking came on Thursday and an order from elvis came on Saturday.........and again it seems I am probably out another $100. The only bright side is bitcoins were down in value so I lost less this time.<br />I contacted Dreamension this last wednesday as I figured enough time had passed that my order should be here and I never got a reply.<br />Then I got a message from SR saying they were going to auto FE unless I had a &quot;resolve&quot; issue, so this time I figured heck with keeping a 0% refund rate, and hit Resolve.........<br />but of course I have yet to hear anything.<br />As a new user, I have tried to be as accommodating as I possibly can as I wanted to insure my stats stayed clean so I could place orders from even the most stringent sellers, so much for that now.<br />No matter the reason, with only 6 purchases, a vendor will be looking at only 6 buys and 1 refund already (tho it looks like I may not even get any type of refund - tho even now I would MUCH rather have the product), so despite taking the hit on the 1st lost order, I am now at a disadvantage from some vendors because they are not going to be looking at the why of the refund.<br />Apparently there are a ton of scammers buying and complaining, so I will instantly be looked at with a wary eye (thanks assholes, I hate fricking thieves).<br /><br />Anyway, I started wondering if anyone else was having a problem so posted here.......<br />I was really looking forward to that order to, would have been my 1st use of mdma and I was actually getting it for medical reasons as I am a disabled vet and the morphine etc has not been working lately and I had read so many good things about mdma and chronic pain..............<br /><br />I plan on purchasing 3 items every month and so far I have gotten 4 out of the 6. Since they are things that an old guy like me would never be able to get without SR, even with the loss I really can&#039;t be too upset as I have no other avenue for these products...........but 2 months in a row does get a bit frustrating plus now even if I ever do hear from Dreamension it will show up on my purchasing stats........<br /><br />And the last BIG bummer for me......I was soooooooooooooo looking forward to some LSD. I have not had any for decades and it use to be my drug of choice. My 1st order didn;t do it for me. I figured maybe heat was the problem. I did order it from overseas so it just came in some plastic wrap to get thru customs I guess. When I opened it up, some of the colors has transferred to the plastic wrap. I ate 2 and basically got a speed trip. As it was a very reputable vendor, I figured the heat may have affected it (another reason I ordered domestic).<br />So I ordered 10 more hits this month from blueviking and it is apparently some pretty clean acid.<br />Took 2 of those.........basically the same thing, tho it was a cleaner speed night.<br />So now I figure it is because of all of the prescribed medicines I take. Mushrooms work just fine, but apparently lsd is not going to cut it for me. So I now have 16 hits of acid . I am going to try taking 4 next time, but considering I take morphine, adderall, tramadol,and&nbsp; neurotonin every day, I doubt it is going to work out for me. Way too much pain if I don&#039;t take the prescribed stuff......so I am left with mushrooms, which i do like, but I soooooooo wanted a good acid trip. man I loved acid.<br /><br />I will not even go into what an idiot I am and what I did with the small bag of dmt..........<br />let;s just say i was clumsy.<br /><br />so I have not been having much luck of late, and is why I really, really wanted to try the mdma........so much for that.<br />Sorry, i am heavy dosing the adderall, trying to get some shit done....I ought to be a vendor, I have shitloads of adderall lol

				1st, I do not think I am allowed to bypass things to sell adderall. I have toyed with the idea of becoming a vendor. I always have tons of extra adderall, sometimes morphine ER and IR, plus I now grow pot and mushrooms , all for strictly personal use so have ended up with a way more then I will ever use. Being an old guy, is not like I have any friends to share it with. Is a big step tho.<br />As for dreamension - have never heard from him. Time was up so I had to go into resolution - he never replied to that either. Logged on today and I had 19 hours before they released my money or file another resolution . Not sure how it works but I asked for all of my money back.<br />&nbsp; I have contacted him twice, no replies, plus he never replied to the resolution.<br />As far as I can tell he has disappeared. <br />&nbsp; I am actually kind of lucky because on my other orders, tho I was not asked to , since they were such reliable vendors I FE. Since this was a domestic order, I decided to wait until I actually got the product.<br />Be great if I do get all of my money back, but I really wanted the mdma while my wife was out of town.

				I&#039;m a little worried myself. I was real excited to test out his 90% pure MDMA and had been confident ordering due to all his positive feedback/reviews and the assumed care he puts into the purity and quality of his wares. But its now been over a week and it has not been marked in transit, on his vendor page it says he hasn&#039;t been on in 2 days, which was when his last update was. Now I have the option to cancel next to the order, which I&#039;ve never had to do before on the Road. My coins have just been tied up for too long for me to be waiting this long without it even being shipped and now from reading this as well as his Review thread it looks like he has gone missing right now. I may give it one more day but if not I&#039;ll have to go ahead and cancel. And speaking of which, if I cancel the order I get all the coins from the purchase correct?

				My order would&#039;ve auto-finalized in two days if I did nothing and since I have not received my orders nor a reply from two different messages three days ago...so I requested a full refund through a resolution. Before I placed my order I had questions about the product and I received almost immediate responses to my pm&#039;s. Now...I&#039;ve had no reply to my pm&#039;s and nor to the resolution request I submitted yesterday for my two orders from Dreamension. It seems a few people in his reviews have had similar issues. Not sure what to make of it at this point just stating was has happened so far with my first two orders from Dreamension and I decided to post since there appears to be others that haven&#039;t had the smoothest buying experience with Dreamension also.&nbsp; :-\&nbsp; I have for many years now received 100% of all my mail including all my purchases from SR. My SR purchases have never taken more than a week and typically arrive within 3 days. These two orders were meant for a special occasion this weekend which just past and that&#039;s why it was ordered domestically 2 weekends ago.<br /><br />member 8 months<br />total transactions 45<br />total spent&nbsp; $922.68<br />refund rate 0%<br />auto-finalize rate 0%<br /><br />escrow (usd)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available<br />$201.87&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;฿0.1220

				Thanks for screwing this up dreamension. Seems there is always someone who screws things up for everyone. You have the buyer scammers who screw it up for the rest of us, and now I apparently have to deal with a vendor who refuses to contact anyone who has their money tied up with you.<br />I am wondering, since I am trying to keep clean purchasing stats so I can buy from certain vendors, since the money was never released and he has yet to even respond to the 2nd resolution, will I get 100% of my money back ?<br />Also, since an actual purchase was never made, will this reflect in my purchasing stats or hopefully just basically give me my money back and pretend it never happened since he has never responded to any messages and not one, but 2 resolution attempts ?<br />Will stink if not only did I not get my product, but I end up losing money and it screws up my clean purchasing stats.<br />I did not get one order from an overseas vendor, but he is a rock solid vendor and responded quickly when I asked about my order, offering a refund. Since I had no doubt he did mail the product, I figured I would just ewat the loss and keep clean purchasing stats as I had no doubt he was not at fault, so I just ate the loss and didnlt think twice about it.<br />Dreamension has been the total opposite experience and I only hope other see what he is doing before tying up any money with him.<br />Thanks for screwing this up dreamension. Apparently my research was not good enough. Is why I need better purchasing stats so i can stick with vendors I know are rock solid.

As a n00b, sometimes my questions may have been a bit redundant, I understand if I do not get a response for questions obviously answered on the vendor page.<br /><br />Heck, I even send my address info in CAPS and Standard so that the copy/paste is easier.<br /><br /><br />With DreaMension, my experience was completely different. My first message was sent with his public PGP key, only thanking him for getting my package in transit so quickly. Now, with less than 5 days left and after 6 plain text messages that included the tx-id and nothing else, I still have not even received a response. My resolution has been pending for 2 days, and not a peep.<br /><br />My resolution request consists of two options: <br />(1) Please respond and at least indicate that the package was mailed out. I do not need the tracking, it puts us both at risk. I just want a human being to respond when I ask something simple as, is there a problem with the order &lt;order#&gt;?<br />(2) Full Refund 100% is what I would like to receive including all the extra transaction fees I had to pay in order to get my funds turned into bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nobody wants a refund here, I would rather receive the package than get some of my money back.&nbsp; I am just going to spend it again anyway, why bother withdrawing it?<br /><br /><br />At no point have I even received an automated: &quot;We are very behind on orders, and will catch up. Please allow &lt;x days&gt; for me to process everything and I will respond to you&quot;<br /><br />Not a post, not a sorry m8, nothing. <br /><br />Can we assume he has been abducted by the DEA and his account is now the property of the Gov&#039;t?&nbsp; I mean, only the Gov&#039;t could possibly move this slow on anything. 5 days to the superdome for water? Yea, sounds like Gov&#039;t to me.<br /><br />

				Figures. After receiving notice my 2nd resolution time was about to expire, I submitted it, asking for a refund. Then of course I finally got a pm from Dreamension, a short message saying something like he will check into it - meaning I can forget about getting a total refund and will more than likely end up with a 50% refund at best, probably if I am lucky.<br />No contact from him whatsoever until after the 2nd resolution submitted. Gee, I wonder what the odds are that I will ever actually see what I ordered..........<br />All I can do is take it as a lesson learned, tho I am not sure what it is at the moment since I thought I did research him fairly well.<br />All I really wanted was to check out some mdma to see how effective it was for use as an aide for chronic pain as I have read some good results by people using it for that.<br />maybe the universe is trying to tell me something.<br />

				to be fair I was just going to update this with the info I received from PM from Dreamension, but is similar to what he has posted above., Says my order shipped out, with a healthy bonus, at the end of last week so should have it within 7 days.<br />While I will obviously appreciate the bonus, all I ever wanted was what I paid for. While I will withhold final judgement, it does seem like things are back on track. If I receive my order like I now believe I will, it will have been a little ( a lot) frustrating, but in the end, I will have sat at home and ordered a product to be delivered to my home that I otherwise do not have access to - so I will not be able to complain.<br />I really am sorry it has all worked out this way, for both dreamension and myself and I honestly am not that thrilled about the &quot;healthy bonus&quot; just because if the service is actually provided that I paid for, I hate to see anything cut into their profit margins as I really do appreciate the service provided.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Will update if/when I receive my order.

				so has anyone actually received their order yet since the explanation ? <br />He said shipments were made going on 2 weeks ago now and I still have yet to receive my order.<br />To be on the safe side their has not been one single piece of mail that I have not personally opened and inspected, no matter who or where it was from . <br /><br />So, still waiting. <br />I am having a major operation in 3 weeks and would have been nice to try some before I am down and out for a while.<br /><br />Was a great, seemingly sincere &quot;apology&quot;, but still no product over 10 days after saying it was shipped.<br />

				I&#039;m still waiting on my order also. Placed original order over a month ago, and it&#039;s been over a week since he said my reship was on its way. He&#039;s had great communication, and was friendly, and offered me thee same explanation as to you guys, but I&#039;m afraid I may have been selectively scammed or something. though not sure why, my account is pretty old and has perfect stats. I&#039;ve never had issues before, even with vendors who turned out to be scammers. If anyone here actually gets their reship, please inform us. i will def. let everyone know if mine does get here.

				Still nothing. I believe I can see the writing on the wall on how this is going to end, which will be me losing at least 50% of my money if not all of it.&nbsp; Since he informed us he did actually ship this time, 2 weeks ago tomorrow supposedly, I would guess he will say it must have been lost in the mail.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Who would have &quot;thunk&quot; it. My 1st piece of domestic lost mail in over 20 years at this address and it is from a guy who said he shipped, then admitted he didn&#039;t, then said he shipped again,,,,and I still never got it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Not to mention I have been opening EVERYTHING, even every stupid credit card app I get just to be on the safe side.<br />A quick time line.<br />&nbsp; Placed 3 orders from 3 different vendors. Received 2 promptly, never received Dreamension&#039;s. After couple of weeks I contracted him, no reply. Tried again in a few days, no reply.<br />&nbsp; Got a message saying sr was going to auto FE so I submit resolution asking for more time, still hoping to get order.<br />Still no reply from Dreamension.<br />Time goes by and I get 2nd auto FE notice. This time I ask for full refund as I have yet to hear from him.<br /><br />Tada - is all it took, asking for a refund apparently. I get a short message, FINALLY, saying it was shipped and he would look into it.<br /><br />I post this thread here.<br />&nbsp;Turns out there are others in the same situation.<br /><br />Now that it is public, we get a big mea culpa. A seemingly sincere apology and tells us it turns out our orders were NOT shipped and he took care of it. Said he shipped them out that Friday (about 2 weeks ago now) and would have it withing 7 days.<br /><br />Still - nothing.<br /><br />Hope I am wrong but I would guess he will say it was shipped , with our big bonus, and it must have got lost in the mail. If he is a good scammer, maybe he shipped to a few people, scammed the rest of us. That way some will say they got it, rest of us are screwed.<br /><br />&nbsp;I went domestic on this for 2 reasons - 1 is I wanted it for a certain time, well obviously forget about that and 2 - domestic mail does NOT get lost. In 20+ years at this address I have NEVER had a piece of domestic USPS mail get lost - never. Only thing that was ever sent to wrong address was a DHL shipment, so unless he sent it DHL, it will not have gotten lost.<br /><br />I only hope anyone thinking about ordering from him does not think I am a lone case or maybe I did something. Everything above is factual and you can read his &quot;apology&quot;.........but still no order.<br /><br />I am tempted to actually sit down and get to 50 posts just so I could post this where more will see it. I may be new with only 8 orders under my belt, but getting scammed by a vendor was not something I gave much thought to since I thought I did my research.<br />Wrong.<br />To be honest, is not even so much about the money now. Was &quot;only&quot; about $110.00 or so. hate to lose it, but so much time has passed I have given up on that. Now it is the principle plus I do not want anyone else to be sitting in my shoes.<br /><br />I said I would withhold judgement on the apology, well I am of a mind since 2 more weeks have passed since he said he did ship it, I feel I can go ahead and pass judgement.<br />I was scammed.<br /><br />Vendors worrry about scamming buyers, and apparently rightly so, but buyers really need to worry about scamming vendors.&nbsp; The only service dreamension has supplied me is basically stealing my money. Way I grew up if there is one thing we do not abide by is a thief, unfortunately due to the nature of tghe beast I am left without recourse.<br /><br />I really hope I can come on and say my bad, I got it, but I am not counting on it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; The seedy side of SR and from a vendor no less.<br />

I have waited a very long time for an order which is advertised as Domestic which from what I read in the comments is not shipped Domestically as advertised. I have received very little communication and very poor response times to 1 out of three messages which has been replied to and my resolution requests. One of the reasons I place my orders with Dreamension was lightning fast answers to my various questions prior to placing my orders. I don&#039;t order internationally because I feel much more secure and have much more peace of mind when I place my orders from SR Domestically and I receive my orders very fast. I have never waited more than just a few days for a Domestic order and I have received every single order I placed Domestically. Honestly I am disappointing that I waited patiently twice and still after so much time has passed I still have not received my orders. Even Internationally...one out of two tries should be successful.

				I have received similar messages as the ones above with my new ETA being the end of next week as well.&nbsp; I have enough days on my first resolution to get me to that point and then we&#039;ll see.&nbsp; I do think it would be odd for a scammer to try and scam so many people at once while still maintaining contact with all of them, perhaps it&#039;s to at least show admins that he&#039;s making an effort to make things right and if stuff gets lost in the mail, he&#039;ll say he shouldn&#039;t have to give 100% refunds, but who knows.&nbsp; I am holding out hope that it really was a big screw up and that he&#039;s trying to make it better, again unless I am mistaken, it would seem odd for a scammer to stay in contact with so many of the people he&#039;s supposedly scamming.&nbsp; Next week will be the key, either a bunch of people finally get their shipment or there&#039;s going to be a lot of people making noise on these forums, and that won&#039;t be good for business.

				So I guess Silk road is basically useless in these matters. I received a message saying the resolution has been extended ANOTHER 10 days.<br />This is part of a message I received from him when he came on here and &quot;apologized&quot; to everyone.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and I quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I tried to focus on completing all the orders first and resolving any last bits before I re-open for normal business and begin answering all the PMs<br /><br />Your order has been shipped out at the end of last week, instead of the end of the week previous, and I have included a gigantic extra bonus of product for you to balance it out<br /><br />This issue has been thoroughly documented and will not re-occur again<br /><br />Sincere apologies for this minor delay,<br />rest assured, I wanted to notify you as soon as possible and I will make it up to you so that both of us are happy<br /><br />Please expect the shipment to arrive in around 7 days from now to be safe :)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>He outright lied. He obviously did not ship my order. A date is not listed on the PM but it was when he apologized to everyone, so no later then July 18th.<br /><br />He outright lied to me<br /><br />And I guess I see how the Silk Road staff works now. Even tho it could not be more obvious a vendor ripped us off, they keep extending the resolution date. Yea, wonder how that would have worked if it was a buyer.......oh yea, they auto finalize the orders.<br />What is the point of having the money in escrow if when a vendor screws us we are apparently just out of luck.<br /><br />I feel like an idiot everyday when I check my mail as I always have hope my package will be there.<br /><br />I love the idea of silk road, but some type of buyer protection needs to be out in place because all they are doing now is protecting the vendor and holding our money.<br />I think it is safe to say the prospect of us ever seeing all of our money again grows slimmer by the day. It is going to drive me nuts if they release any money to him.<br />Is strictly the principle at this point.<br /><br />You are insane if u place an order with dreamension. Do your research and only order from high quality vendors because Silk Road obviously could care less about the buyer.

				Amazing part is that all his listings are still up and his feedback is 98.2 although a lot of it is 5/5 refund given etc. People are still ordering apparently. If I were a vendor that had some major wrench thrown into my works I would drop all of my listings until I fixed screw up. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9548d23b8d/10

				and another day and of course nothing in the mail. I don&#039;t understand how/why silk road extended it another 10 days without asking me. I got a message and it just said it has been extended another 10 days.<br />It is obvious I am not alone here, so obviously a vendor screwing a bunch of people over takes priority over buyers.<br />I guess it is basically they know there isn&#039;t any place else like Silk Road so you are pretty much forced to continue to do business here. Wonder if I am burning any bridges here ?<br />It has given me a much better understanding on how business is conducted here. <br />Being new, I was concerned about keeping good buying stats, all I really read about is the buyers who scammed the vendors. Can&#039;t do business with many until u get a certain amount of buys or money spent. <br />I read about a few scamming vendors, but figured the money is in escrow........<br />yea, so much for that.I see how well that works now.<br />Basically u are just screwed even when a vendor doesn&#039;t even ship your order.<br /><br />At least it is only about a $110.00 lesson learned for me. I would guess there are others who are losing more. <br />Is too bad since things were actually set in place to protect us from this very thing. Never dawned on me they would protect the vendor at all costs.<br /><br />Of course I have yet to hear from Dreamension since he told me my order was shipped out over 2 weeks ago. Pretty slick of him tho - come on and give a seemingly heartfelt mea culpa and tell us he is giving us a BIG bonus for out troubles.....yea, hey dreamension, forget the bonus, can I just have my money back - ooops, forgot, it is in escrow and silk road won&#039;t give it back

Not one refund/auto finalize. Heck, I even FE for a couple repeat orders because I know how difficult it can be translating BTC to cash. <br /><br />On 7/18, after I updated the resolution center with some ridiculous rage post, I finally got another response from DR reporting that my package was shipped out on the 12th and should have arrived already.&nbsp; <br /><br />If that truly was the case, wouldn&#039;t you message the buyer with a &quot;hey, did you get your package yet. tracking or whatever shows delivered/undelivered&quot;. Release my funds from escrow please.&nbsp; Am I right? <br /><br />Well, DR again offered to reship @ 150% of the original order but at this point, his words are falling on deaf ears.&nbsp; While I truly do appreciate the effort, nothing actually matters if no package is shipped.&nbsp; <br /><br />DR suggested that my package could have accidentally been intercepted by a neighbor, wrong.&nbsp; My employer requires that I operate out of my house so I am always here when the mail carrier arrives between 945a and 1036a on weekdays.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, as a professional drug addict, I can sure tell you that if drugs are in transit, I am gonna be on that mailbox like a two-dicked dog at bitch-fest. In addition, the address orders are shipped to is a valid home address with a mailbox approx 6&quot; from the doorbell.&nbsp; The mail carrier has to come up to the porch to deliver mail, I have never missed it.&nbsp; Coincidentally have kept every piece of mail that has arrived since 7/5. Every single article has been inspected and re-inspected in the event it was overlooked. <br /><br />Furthermore, the name used to ship SR packages is written in a specific manner so they stand out to me and not the mail carrier and any pkg from SR has had all address/tracking information removed. <br /><br /><br />Suffice it to say, nothing remotely close to my order has ever shown up and even after begging DR to give me some details about what it looks like have not returned any sort of response from him/her.<br /><br /><br />So, after all the work DR has put into making his profile reflect such a high/positive number, I can only feel baffled at having been shafted this hard.&nbsp; I mean, $75 is not really a lot of money, and once you factor in SR vendor fees, it makes me wonder exactly what is going on in DR&#039;s head. <br /><br />So, an emoticon is the only way to describe how I feel at this point.&nbsp; &nbsp;凸 (｀0´)凸. This is by no means directed specifically at you DR. The fact that you would offer a reship amazes me but you have to agree that it is pretty much all BS at this point. <br /><br />Just to show my sincerity and attempt to give DR the benefit of the doubt, I am going to publicly state that if two packages eventually do arrive, I will be more than happy to submit a payment for the second package equal to my original order.&nbsp; I spent $100 total which turned into $75 before I figured out a better way to get BTC on my account. <br /><br /><br /><br />My buyer stats: <br /><br />&nbsp;Member for: 1 month<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year<br />total&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br />spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$478.41 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$638.21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$638.21<br />refund &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />finalize &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0%<br /><br /><br /><br />¯\_(⊙︿⊙)_/¯<br /><br /><br />WTF<br />

				It beats me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I originally specified in the resolution center that I would commit to an additional 14 days! I believe DR accepted this resolution and that is how mine got extended. <br /><br />I really did want to give him the benefit of the doubt here. I can only imagine running a business online such as this and something fucked up happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />It would really help if maybe we got some kind of response from DR, but not so much as a peep. This is what worries me.&nbsp; Then out of nowhere a &quot;Greetings Friend&quot; message and all is well for a couple days.&nbsp; I mean, it great and all to hear from you but not even a &quot;hey whats up with the order?&quot; C&#039;mon...<br /><br />If you make sure you request 100% refund in the resolution center and post a coherent summary of your side of the story, I believe an Admin/SR Moderator will decide whether you get your money out of escrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />The wiki states that it is up to the admin whether you get your money back at 100% or less based on the evidence provided, which is our posts. So make it good.

				and yet another day passes and nothing in the mail.<br />The 1st resolution I had to do as time ran out, I asked to extend it 7 days, still hopeful. The 2nd time I asked for a refund, instead, Silk Road extended it either 5 or 7 days. The THIRD time I was not even asked, I logged in and saw that they had went ahead and extended it another 7 days. Never asked me.<br />I have been very disappointed with the way Silk Road has handled this. I feel they should have refunded my money the 2nd time when I asked and I definitely do not think they should have extended it the 3rd time for another 7 days without even asking.<br />I can appreciate trying to protect a vendor from a singular scumbag trying to rip them off, but when you have a large group of people saying they never got their orders and the vendor himself lying about it, plus never returning messages etc..........where is the buyer protection ?<br />The whole point of escrow is for this exact type of sitiuation yet Silk Road keeps holding on to our money.<br />Yes I am mad at Dreamension, but silk road could have and should have ended this a week or 2 ago by refunding all of our money, so they bear some of the responsibility. Doesn&#039;t take a genius to see dreamension is screwing us over

He has told me twice it has been shipped out - each time it was when the time had expired and he gets SR to keep extending it.<br /><br />Wait - he will next tell me it was lost in the mail and offer me a 50% refund and silk road will agree with him - even after lying about shipping it already<br />This issue has been thoroughly documented and will not re-occur again

				*****EVERYONE PLEASE READ IF YOU GET YOUR ORDER DO NOT FINALIZE UNTIL YOU&#039;VE TRIED THE PRODUCT****<br /><br />I ordered 4 tabs on june 27th and marked shipped on June 30th. Reciveved 6 Tabs on 8/2 , all in one big rectangle I had to cut into the squares. We dosed at 11am on Saturday the 8/3. I am so f*cking glad I did not release payment after I saw it come. He asked for 10 more days 11 hours ago and if he had read his message inbox before that he would&#039;ve seen this message I sent him.<br /><br />(Here&#039;s the last message I sent to DreaMensioN last night)<br />Hey so your tabs showed up and none of them worked. I ate one waited an hour nothing, another waited an hour nothing and a third, my lightweight ~120 girlfriend who trips balls off of ~80mcg acid said she felt it but as much as she does when we makeout after i eat a tab for like 5 minutes so....the last 2 tabs went to Ehrlich&#039;s tests and so I put a small piece of one blotter into the vial with the liquid. I suspected the tabs weren&#039;t LSD (due to unpreforation, bitter taste and it affected us different than I would expect from LSD). After the blotter was in the liquid I took the wick out, look and it was defiantly not turning purple anytime soon and submerged it and it sucked up almost all the liquid. the wick changed to a light yellow color but that was about it. Since it was a 1 time only test kit, I squeezed the wick to try to put some of the liquid back into the vial and it was definitely yellow. No way it&#039;s acid. If you wanna go ahead and refund me 100% i&#039;ll say i got great acid and ill praise you like a good at this point. It&#039;s been a month waiting and im half an hour late because I needed to type this out now. Just do the right thing and cut your losses. Thanks and hopefully this is the last message like this I&#039;ll have to send.<br /><br /><br />(Last message I sent in my resolution, still haven&#039;t released payments and he keeps asking for max time each time)<br />&nbsp; Product had already arrived, it is unpreforated tabs that are not real acid. I did a 3 of them at a time and barely felt anything. I felt like it was a weak research chemical and my friends who trip off half a tab of street ~100mcg acid took two each and they felt nothing at all. The paper also tasted like blank paper with a small amount of what appears to be part of the NBOMe series. This entire order is ridiculous. If I have to wait 10 more days or they believe you again (even though at least 10 other people on the community forums are saying the same)&nbsp; I will personally spend all my time making sure no one will ever buy from you again. I am letting you keep 10% because I pity you. You sold a false product and was a month late on supplying it. So you lied to the customer in two ways. Accept this offer or your feedback and forums will definitely take a blow. If he still is pushing for more time on all his clients then he must be waiting for these orders in resolution to finish so he can get out of here quick. Dealers that take a month to deliver a product that shouldn&#039;t have taken more then a week. Also, only 1 vacuum seal instead of three like you advertise. Maybe it was real acid and your inability to properly store, ship and protect your merchandise is what broke 4 of out 6 of them. One has been tested and came up yellow on an Ehrlich&#039;s regent test. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Staff- There are 5 topics in the forums totaling 11 pages all about DReaMensioN and buyers like me who he is ripping off. Do not let him wait any longer because he&#039;s sending out fake tabs and once people get them, they&#039;ll finalize before trying anything and he&#039;ll have made so much money with just this ripoff scheme, seems like he has at least 15 people in resolution and once these fake tabs come on Monday and people start to finalize i guarantee he&#039;ll be gone.<br /><br />~skrill3xx/onlyAJJ/AndrewJacksonJihad/skrill3x

				and I received this message<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your reship is on the way to you, extending due date by 10 days to accommodate in-transit time </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>He has already told me twice that my order has already been shipped - not getting ready to ship, not about to ship, but already shipped.<br />So this is the 3rd time he has told me this.<br /><br />It has an action asking me to &quot;accept&quot; the extra 10 days. I am not accepting this. Should not make any difference if it has already been shipped right ? No doubt tomorrow when the time is over for the resolution, Silk Road will go ahead and extend it anyway like they have the previous times.<br /><br />As he has already told me my order has been shipped twice before, I am of the opinion there is a decent chance he is setting this up to get lost in the mail. I think a tracking number should have been mandatory since this is the last message I received from him, on July 27th - <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have looked into and double checked your order personally,<br />your shipment has been upgraded to 150% of your original order Plus a generous bonus of my ultimate LSD has been included in it for absolutely free<br /><br />also we know have exact ETA for the arrival of your package, and it is being near the end of next week</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As u can tell, that time has come and gone.

				a thought just came to me, as he keeps extending the date by telling me it has been shipped, I wonder if he is just hoping I mess up and am not on SR the day the resolution expires, allowing him to get paid.<br />If for any reason I can not get on SR, say tomorrow for instance - he gets paid, I am still screwed. <br />Except for this one thing, is not like I visit SR every day.<br />Just a thought - maybe not true, but nothing makes sense since he has told me it has shipped 3 times now

				and another day passes and still nothing in the mail.<br />SR did say if I do not receive it by Friday they will refund my money.<br />They said it has taken so long because basically they want to be sure who is at fault. I understand they must deal with some strange things, but I do not see how there is any mistaking this one since. <br />At least this headache should be over by Friday - tho now I have major surgery in 2 weeks so it will be too late to order anything else.<br /><br />Tho I wonder if we should start taking bets if dreamension now changes his tune and instead of twelling us a 4th time it<br /><br />Of course now Dreamension will probably change his song and dance and instead of telling us a 4th time he has shipped the order, will now say he did ship so must have got lost in the mail.......

				&nbsp; &nbsp;:-[&nbsp; &nbsp;After waiting a month and a day for him to process an order I am about to cancel it. I ordered 1 very expensive gram of MDMA thinking it would be nice to sample a very good quality product. It has stayed in the processing status for a ridiculous amount of time. Quality products and promises of extra bonuses are tempting but I think Dreamension knows our weaknesses plus you can&#039;t help but want to think the best of someone.<br /><br />Thank-you everyone who has added to this forum. You have helped me come to my senses. Sorry to all of you who are still in resolution. <br /><br />I will report this seller to SR I hope this will help them to make the decision to resolve this for everyone and return everyone&#039;s coins. <br /><br />Don&#039;t order from Dreamension the last message on his page was on the 3rd of August saying all backlog orders would be worked out in the next few days. NOTHING since then. Very lazy and very dodgy seller if you ask me. No sign of working anything out since then. Today he hasn&#039;t been on SR for 2 days, all very suspicious. It&#039;s like he has disappeared. <br /><br />Don&#039;t buy from this seller<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy from this seller<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy from this seller<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy from this seller<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy from this seller<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy from this seller

				After reading this from the start just now I am shocked that the resolutio from Sr has not kicked in - this makes me very wary of so called escrow.&nbsp; WTF has SR got to lose by paying people their money from an obvious scumbag scammer.&nbsp; I feel sorry for you all.
