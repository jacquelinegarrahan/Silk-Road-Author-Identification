				So i went to my local chase to make my first bitcoin purchase.&nbsp; I used Bitme.&nbsp; I filled out the slip, handed it to the lady and she was curious so she asked what this &quot;Bitme&quot; company was selling.&nbsp; She asked like 3 times because I couldn&#039;t really understand then when I got what she was saying, i got nervous and said &quot;oh, they sell bitcoins&quot;.&nbsp; Obviously she had no clue what it was so I said its just an online currency and that I was making an investment. She just seemed kind of confused then finished up and said have a nice day.&nbsp; I know this is probably no big deal, especially since buying bitcoins isnt illegal, i&#039;m just a little sketched out by it and I wanted to know if i should have anything to worry about (i kno this is ridiculous to worry about).&nbsp; the deposit was in no way connected to me as I didn&#039;t have to give my name or any ID.

				you can say &quot;bitcoins&quot; or maybe tell her you aren&#039;t sure, it is for a friend who asked you to make the deposit.&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t matter really, as you didn&#039;t give your name.

				Just be like &quot;I&#039;m buying crack on Silk Road.&quot;<br /><br />Lol jk I doubt you have anything to worry about though.&nbsp; Saying you&#039;re doing an investment is probably a good excuse.&nbsp; Not sure what people buy with bitcoins other than drugs really :confused:

				No need to be nervous when buying bitcoins. They aren&#039;t illegal and people use bitcoins for completely legal things. Just tell the truth about what you&#039;re exchanging cash for, but of course never tell them what your exchanging your bitcoins for&nbsp; ;)
