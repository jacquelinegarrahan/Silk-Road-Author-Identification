				If they marked it in transit it is all on them and should be on it way. If it doesn&#039;t arrive and they don&#039;t respond to your messages then take it to the resolution center.

				If you chose the wrong option then vendor will most likely reduce the amount of whatever you ordered to make up for it. <br /><br />With the speed of Tor and the amount of questions that are answered in the listing or profile vendors get asked daily they can&#039;t answer them all especially ones like &#039;my order was marked in transit, does that mean it&#039;s in transit?&#039;. <br /><br />Answering pms can take literally all day, can&#039;t imagine what it&#039;s like for the big sellers, I know some have pm staff specifically for that reason.

				They prob just scammed you anyway lots of scammers from that neck of the woods you will most likely get a 50A% refund as that seems the most popular scam going these days

				@chillaandretti<br />why are you ordering one blotter from czech republic? <br />not saying you shouldn&#039;t but when there&#039;s plenty stateside, why would you go through the aggro for one blotter from across the ocean?
