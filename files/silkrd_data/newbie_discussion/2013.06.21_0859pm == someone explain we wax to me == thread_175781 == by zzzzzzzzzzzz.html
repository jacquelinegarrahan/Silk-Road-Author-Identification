				Ive smoked weed for a long long time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve even grown my own for roughly 7-8 years (the strain was LSD....good shit).&nbsp; I&#039;ve made hash many different ways and I&#039;ve vaped long before vaping was cool.<br /><br />However, I am not familiar with the wax.&nbsp; Can someone enlighten me on wtf that is?<br /><br />I saw a listing for 3.5g that looks interesting but I have no feel for how long that will last or even what to do with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I read a post from someone that said to put it on a knife, heat it, and use an empty pen container to inhale.&nbsp; I presume you can smoke it however you&#039;d like but is that how everyone smokes it?&nbsp; Can you put it in an e-cig?<br /><br />Basically, I have a million questions so please fill me in....

				i had some out in cali for the first time a few weeks ago<br /><br />its kind of like hash but not so crumbly, more like an ear wax<br /><br />put it in a g-pen and WOW--purchased a few kinds of hash out there but the wax was the best (it was skywalker OG wax)<br /><br />u can use the knife method u mentioned or u can sprinkle it in blunts and stuff<br /><br />but if you are looking for a more scientific explanation, i dont have it sorry :-[

				You work it out with your buds or trims to bho (butanehoneyoil).<br />After this you have to vac it some times, you must have a hand for it. <br />Different vac-times, different forms of nearly pure thc. Wax, Shatter, Budder etc...

				Ok, cool.&nbsp; thx for the explanation<br /><br />How is the high?&nbsp; As I said, I&#039;ve vaped before vaping was cool but eventually went back to my trusty bong as I felt it gave me a better high.&nbsp; &nbsp;How does wax compare?&nbsp; &nbsp;If I am thinking about it right, I am guessing that it&#039;s very very close to vaping....but that&#039;s just a guess.

				Oh i think it would be different effect, for different products and strains or what would other people say?<br />Best way to consume is a oildome, but the vaporizer should do hi´s work too.<br /><br />At least i had some wax from california. I tasted 0,07 g in hit with the bong.<br />Slwoly but hard cames the turn.<br /><br />Great thing!<br /><br />I made&nbsp; a lot of bho on my own way, but the consistency of budder or wax is much better.<br />For bho i definitly prefer the oil dome !

				Yea, different strains will have diff effects.<br /><br />What I really meant is:&nbsp; if you smoke and wax the same strain, what is the difference in the high?&nbsp; I ask because I notice a big difference between vaping and a bong.

				Yes I am talking about the effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe I am alone on this one?????<br /><br />When I vape regular weed, the high is much headier and front of the forehead stony.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I bong the same strain, it&#039;s quite a bit more &quot;rounded out&quot; and maybe even a bit more uplifting.&nbsp; &nbsp;Same strain(s) but I can definitely feel a difference between vaping and a bong no matter the strain.<br /><br />I was curious what the wax was like but after reading more listings, I am guessing it is similar to the high when vaping.&nbsp; Or maybe vaping &quot;finger hash&quot; -- the sticky you pull off your fingers after a trim.

				ermegerd!<br /><br />so marijuana concentrates it is... awesome thread!!!!!<br /><br />so hey dude i just gotta congratulations... you will soon, if you search, find an awesome world of hash awaiting you! i am not a 710 expert but i am in triaining<br /><br />there are many ways of making hash. in modern day, butane is used very often as a solvent to strip medicine from the plant material. as it has been mentioned also so far in this thread, you will then want to purge the butane from the oil that you have blasted onto a pyrex - for example.&nbsp; a vacuum can be used to effectively purge the material.<br /><br />varying techniques with different solvents and your plant material can result in your oil becoming sappy, glassy, waxy, crumbly...&nbsp; the different styles store in different ways. i personally love hash, but i seem to really get down on some winterized sappy shatter... but hey, there is also bubble hash that is phenomenal! get the water out quickly and you&#039;ll have some fine product!! <br /><br />as for an intro as to how you can get down with the get down, check out aqualabtechnologies.com - no muss no fuss!<br /><br />check youtube for various 710 videos... bho gone bad, learn from others mistakes if you so choose. co2 oil, is also super fine. <br /><br />and of course it all starts with good plants!<br /><br />as a matter of fact, while we are on the subject, pardon me whilst i go dab... <br /><br />again, welcome... clean hash rules!

				furthermore, the preservation of the plant&#039;s terpene profile is a dubious achievement! therefore your master kush, for example, R E A L L Y tastes like super clean B A M master kush all in your face!!! preserve the terps!<br /><br />scope the terpene profile on the plants you have and be sure to not destroy them in the process. some of them are very delicate in relation to thc when it comes to getting them from the plant matter to the errl.<br /><br />oh and the high... bro... seriously like no other. welcome, we&#039;ve been expecting you!

				Making high quality dabber &quot;butter&quot; requires exacting heat and vacuum reuirements.&nbsp; If these standards of pressure and temperature are not met you can loose taste and product consistency.&nbsp; I hear that wax is just a failed butter, but it will still get you ripped!
