				Hey guys<br />just got a zip of southern humboldts sap. was very excited to try his product as i have heard good feedback and he is supposed to put a variety of strains in his orders of sap. it came in 28 little vials with not sap or wax but runny black oil. this is hash oil, not sap/wax, and it sucks. it is black, doesnt even stick to the dabber, and sizzles on the nail when you do get it on. the shit just sucks. first i get jacked 350 last week, and now when i try to get back on my feet, i get this bullshit. no one wants black runny oil that you can barely get out of the jar, and thats if you even want to get it out. i told southern humboldt in a message before i left him bad feedback that i was dissapointed with the sap and it was very poor quality. all he said was that he didnt make it himself and that someone else made it. so thats an excuse for it to be complete shit i guess??? i wish he could of gave me some kind of refund or some better shit for free. he can have this runny black oil back cuz no one wants it around here! hope you enjoy my $600 southern humboldt, just more and more $ wasted on this site. for every cool/dank product i get on here, i get one bad one and im sick of these shitty odds and shitty vendors!

				I&#039;ve noticed many buyers complaining about purchasing wax, or crumble hash. What may be happening is when it ships, it sits in a super hot ass truck and melts. <br /><br />Do you live in a state that is extremely hot? and humid? <br /><br />the item probably started off fine, right when shipped, then sat out in a metal postal truck after being sorted prior to being loaded on a freight plane, again extremely hot, probably zero air conditioning. <br /><br />End result, crappy hash oil.<br />&nbsp;----i don&#039;t sell wax, for this exact reason.&nbsp; <br />You should send a message to the vendor and try to work it out

				I&#039;ve been looking into SouthernHumboldt for a while now and def thinking about making my first order with either him or ForeverStrung. <br />If heat was the issue SH does address this on his vendor page and says to throw it in the freezer for a bit, and it is summer so I guess you cant really blame him just hope I don&#039;t have any issues<br />MM54<br />

				What NorCalChronic said is likely what happened here. Cargo planes (mail planes) can get really, really hot, as there usually isn&#039;t a need for air conditioning anywhere but the cockpit.

				oil will not turn black from heat....<br />it&#039;s not hitting 200 degrees inside a cargo plane, a hub, or a truck..<br />there is no excuse for BLACK oil...<br />the only way you&#039;re gonna get black oil <br />is if its an ice water extract and they pressed it..<br />and it retained moisture and starts to mold...<br />it&#039;ll then turn black and smell terrible.<br /><br />this sounds like reclaim.. or old trim...<br /><br /><br />/thumbs

				This was definitely not wax that got to warm and turned to oil. this is southern humboldt being a bitch and pulling a bait and switch on his customers. this shit is black runny oil that will not even stick to my dabber! what the fuck am i supposed to do with this shit. customers dont want it and southern humboldt wont do shit about it either, even though on his vendor page it says he will try to help fix the situation if a customer is unhappy with product. i feel like southern humboldt lied to me and until he gives me some kind of refund, i would highly recommend everyone to avoid him and his shitty oil he calls sap!
