				So I&#039;m getting a little worried. I&#039;ve been reading how TORmail and other sites on the dark web have been infiltrated and compromised by LE, and how they&#039;re placing tracking cookies and installed trojans and hijackers that make the computer call their offices and stuff. <br /><br />What&#039;s preventing them from doing that on here? <br /><br />As a buyer and consumer of very small amounts (as opposed to buying in bulk and re selling on the streets), what can we/I do to protect ourselves? I see all the threads, but a nice, quick, layman&#039;s terms would really help.

Also you need to just keep a clean house when expecting deliverys.<br />Another thing: dont blast the Silk Road on any kind of Social Media site!, learn about plausible deniability, read some how to guides on the forums and the one from amazon.<br /><br />Dont download anything from the internet, especially something from Silk Road or other dark web website.Turn the security all the way up on your non Tor browser too.
