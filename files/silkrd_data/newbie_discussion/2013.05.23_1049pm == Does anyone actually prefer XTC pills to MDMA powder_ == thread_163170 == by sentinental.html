				I&#039;ve only took pills once in my life when I knew I could trust the source, but I figure most of the legit vendors on SR sell high quality pills so I can take them again. What are the pros and cons of each, and is there any difference in what you feel when you take them?

				Not unless there is another substance in the press, which if you where to buy pill here on SR, when there is another substance in the pill, the vendor will state such.<br /><br />I used to like pills better, years ago, when even if you got a pill with little MDMA in it, it was still an awesome time. Back in the day, if you got a &#039;weak&#039; or &#039;shitty&#039; pill, it was still great because back then &#039;shitty&#039; was a pill chock full O&#039; different drugs, not just fillers and bogus OTC stims.<br /><br />

				Once you&#039;ve tried a few powder vendors and find the ones with high purity, I&#039;ve always thought the powder is better. If you&#039;re willing to go to the bother of packing the capsules, you can attain your perfect personal dose :)

				Yes caffeine is a great add on to MDMA. Help&#039;s with the rushes and absorption of the MDMA into the blood.

				Caffeine can enhance a roll, for some. Mostly it just gives you jitters angst and an upset stomach.<br /><br />The &#039;fun&#039; drugs I meant,from way back when are as follows; Ketamine, 2cb, dxm, meth, amphetamine.. and less common, then and especially now, heroin and PCP. <br /><br />All that stuff in ecstasy pills has become almost non existent, I assume due to all the RCs that have surfaced in the past 15 yrs or so.
