				I will always go domestic if possible.&nbsp; Ordering international means going through customs, which means the chances of your package being intercepted just went up.&nbsp; If ordering international try and steer clear of certain countries like NL which can increase the chances of your package being checked at customs.&nbsp; Also, domestic packages will arrive much quicker than international.<br /><br />That being said, you may find that a product you wish can only be ordered via an international vendor.&nbsp; As with any transaction on SR, research, research, and research some more.&nbsp; Check out the vendor on the forums, if you don&#039;t find much information, post a polite message asking for any current clients of the vendor to post their experiences with that vendor on the forums (Although, I will say, if you cannot find anything regarding the vendor on the forums and the have supposedly been around for some time, you may want to look for another vendor).<br /><br />When ordering international I stuck to the US, UK and France.&nbsp; There is some stuff I would really like from vendors in the Netherlands, India and China, but I&#039;ve held off so far, but I have read posts on the forums from a number of buyers who have purchased from them in Canada and the US and have received their packages without any trouble.<br /><br />If you do order international keep the number of orders to a reasonable number. You don&#039;t want to have a dozen international orders all converging at your mailbox in the same time period, space them out, wait until you have received most of your orders before you start ordering more.
