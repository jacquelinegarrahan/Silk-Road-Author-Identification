				Just got on board probably wrong time of day to be posting this being early morning in APAC,&nbsp; but I see a large number of US/EU based people but no so much AUS/NZ/ASIA&nbsp; region.<br /><br />Anyone from these countries online and experienced with SR that might give some advice or share some info on vendors based in the Southern Hemisphere or getting packages posted from US/EU.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for reading and for replying <br /><br />Cheers - Biggie

				Patience is Key, For me, I&#039;m located in Malaysia, so south east asia. I ordered on the 18th and 19th from 2 vendors in Netherlands, one from Italy. I received 2 of my deliveries, 1 from Netherlands and Italy, and Am still waiting for the other one in Netherlands. <br />Overall it takes about 8-15 days max, I had both of them come on the 8th and 9th day... Although hopefully Tomorrow I&#039;ll get my last delivery!<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve never ordered from AUS before though, and I&#039;ve just ordered from UK so that might take another 10 days...<br />Keep yourself distracted, because if its your first time buying, you get too anxious for your stuff and get frustrated when the mailman drops nothing in your box.<br /><br />Not much to say, pick your vendors wisely and always scope their profile! <br /><br />I&#039;m off to bed anyways, good luck yeah! :)

				Thanks for your advice, think I&#039;ll start domestic on small packages and move my way up, customs is pretty tight in my country so getting things in from O/S i think there will be a big risk of it it getting picked up and confiscated. <br /><br />I hear of vendors getting fake positive feedback, how can one be sure if they&#039;re legit or not? Also seems to be a premium over street prices for some. Guess it&#039;s like home delivery pizza is more for delivery vs pick up&nbsp; ;)

				Haha yeah, but good luck if you want to start becoming a vendor, I suggest checking out the packaging section and invest in some proper bags and what not, unless you can get them yourself! And no harm starting off small and gaining more experience till you are confident to start going in bulk. As for knowing if a vendor is legit or not is difficult, but just looking through their history of feedbacks may help, if it looks too obvious that its a self rating and whatt not. Not to mention his rating out of 100 by his name, that will be a good indicator.<br /><br />Sometimes being scammed is inevitable, this is because some great vendors are known to selectively scam, and use FE methods on newbies as well. I saw that last year or so some Canadian vendor who was super well known for his heroin and meth who was only dealing in Canada, decided to make a sale for 420 day and make his shippings worldwide. He was known for his accountability and trust, but in the end he just scammed everyone and closed his account, then was never heard of! <br /><br />I have no experience in dealing or being a vendor so I don&#039;t have much to say, hopefully some experienced vendor can jump in this thread and give you some advice.. Just do as much reading as you can on the forums, I&#039;m pretty sure to be a vendor here you have to be somewhat devoted to ensure safety between you and your client.
