				OK - I am a newbie to all this - but truth be told, I am old enough to be your father and for some their grandpa!&nbsp; And I ramble like Grandpa before I get to the questions...<br /><br />The frau got a job in the big city, taking me away from my friends in the Santa Cruz Mountains.&nbsp; No bud for a year!&nbsp; So I heard of this crazy SR but never thought it was possible, and lo and behold - I be here!<br /><br />Of course it was a f-ng nightmare just getting BTC - I was caught in the middle of the run-up.&nbsp; The when I finally get 4 BTC, the SR goes black.<br /><br />When SR comes back to life, I get a quick order in - get a quick reply to my message.&nbsp; SR goes black again and this morning I see &quot;In Transit.&quot;&nbsp; As a courtesy I FE&#039;d the vendor.&nbsp; Not because he/she asked, but because the blackouts and such.&nbsp; The vendor has a stellar rating and was kind to this old codger who can&#039;t get PGP to work on his computer.<br /><br />TL/DR<br />Question one:&nbsp; Did I f - up by finalizing early? I am not going to be a quantity buyer - I&#039;m old, I don&#039;t do that much;&nbsp; I only smoke a little now and then.&nbsp; I thought I needed to get a good buyer&#039;s rep going and that would be the way.<br />Q2: Gddmn GPG crashes when I start it.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing out there that I can find that describes a solution.&nbsp; If I buy the commercial version - does that work with everyone?<br /><br />Any advice for anything will be appreciated.

				Bitcoin market&#039;s always been up and down, though it seems to get particularly volatile the higher it&#039;s value becomes. As for messing up, depends on the vendor, I guess. It&#039;s not likely that someone&#039;s going to go &quot;oh, he finalized early, I don&#039;t have to send it now!&quot; The scammers tend to be the scammers. Generally the good vendors don&#039;t just sell to &quot;good buyers.&quot; Some of them may require early finalization or not ship large amounts or whatever, but it&#039;s just a precaution that they&#039;ll get their money, not that they&#039;re trying to form a secret club.<br /><br />You should be fine, though with pot I&#039;d recommend you check out the rumor mill before ordering. Packaging is notoriously difficult with marijuana.

				Hey OP.<br />If you have a windows pc, create a virtual machine and install kleopatra for your PGP needs. If you&#039;re on linux, do a VM wine-style and do the same. Kleo really is a no brainer. Here&#039;s a good reference (clearnet):<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/wiki/guides/multiplayer_dreams_/guide_1#wiki_encrypting_your_address<br /><br />As for the FE, as long as your researched your vendor and overall it looks good, you should be fine.

				If the vendor has a stellar rep you should be fine - 4 BTC is quite a lot to FE on though at the current market price. Im sure the vendor won&#039;t mind you sending them a quick message for peace of mind, if they&#039;re reputable. <br /><br />Weird that GPG crashes for you. Have you got the latest nightly build? That fixed everything for me<br /><br />&lt;&lt;clearnet&gt;&gt; https://nightly.gpgtools.org &lt;&lt;clearnet&gt;&gt;<br />
