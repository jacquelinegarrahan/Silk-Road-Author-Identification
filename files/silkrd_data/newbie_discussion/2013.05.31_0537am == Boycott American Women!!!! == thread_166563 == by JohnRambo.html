				BOYCOTT AMERICAN WOMEN<br />Why American men should not marry American women<br /><br />http://boycottamericanwomen.blogspot.com/<br /><br />I am an American man, and I have decided to boycott American women. In a nutshell, American women are the most likely to cheat on you, to divorce you, to get fat, to steal half of your money in the divorce courts, don&#039;t know how to cook or clean, don&#039;t want to have children, etc. Therefore, what intelligent man would want to get involved with American women?<br /><br />American women are generally immature, selfish, extremely arrogant and self-centered, mentally unstable, irresponsible, and highly unchaste. The behavior of most American women is utterly disgusting, to say the least.<br /><br />This blog is my attempt to explain why I feel American women are inferior to foreign women (non-American women), and why American men should boycott American women, and date/marry only foreign (non-American) women.<br /><br />I encourage ALL American men to NEVER MARRY American women, and date/marry only foreign (non-American) women.<br /><br />A few more reasons to stay away from American women?<br /><br />-30 percent of American women take psychiatric drugs.<br />-25 percent of women under the age of 30 have at least one STD.<br />-85 percent of divorces in America are INITIATED by women, thus women are responsible for the vast majority of divorces.<br />-70 percent of criminals in America were raised by single mothers, thus feminism is responsible for most crime in America.<br />-60 percent of American women are fat, overweight, according to government statistics<br /><br />If you want to get married, find a nice foreign girl from Asia, or South America, or Russia/Eastern Europe. DO NOT MARRY AN AMERICAN WOMAN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!<br /><br />Give American women the husband they deserve- NONE!<br /><br />BOYCOTT AMERICAN WOMEN!

				OH HOW CUTE! POOR WITTLE BABY IS UPSET BECAUSE MEN ARE BOYCOTTING HER!! BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!<br /><br />Over 50 percent of American women are single, without a boyfriend or husband, so the fact is, MOST MEN DO NOT WANT YOU WORTHLESS AMERICAN WHORES ANYMORE!<br /><br />You still have two options though:<br /><br />1. become a lesbian<br /><br />or<br /><br />2. get used to living alone with your ten cats<br /><br />THOSE ARE YOUR TWO OPTIONS, WHORE!<br /><br />As for us American men, we are sick of you and millions of us are marrying foreign women. I married a nice young asian girl, and I would NEVER even think about touching one of you disgusting American women ever again. Asian women are 1000 times better than you, this is why so many American guys are rejecting you and going for asian women.<br /><br />Have fun growing old alone with your 10 cats, whore.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />John Rambo, Anti-feminist Soldier<br />John.Rambo@crimesagainstfathers.com

				I hate to say it, but I think Rambo has a point (thought proportionally, it&#039;s been blown out into orbit). I been with American women that didn&#039;t have any of these qualities. But I&#039;ve been with far too many with similar qualities for Rambo&#039;s generalizations to be a coincidence. American women are spectacularly self-absorbed, with a self-destructive definition of what it means to be healthily independent.

				Why are American women fat and wild?<br /><br />Because they were oppressed for hundreds of years. Stuck in kitchens and at home while their husbands made the money. Not allowed to vote. No one cared if you beat and raped your wife.<br /><br />Times are different now, women can do whatever they want. They don&#039;t NEED a man to do anything for them, so if they wanna get fat and act wild, that&#039;s their perogative.<br /><br />Stop being jealous that BBC gets more than you, you don&#039;t have to be AGAINST anyone to have a happy life.<br /><br /><br />

				way to be a sexist pig.<br />hate to say it but most those things you said about American women are just rubbish and the few cases that is might be true is just cause and effect from American men.<br />you&#039;re obviously the type who thinks women should be there to serve men still and you&#039;re pissed that they think for themselves now and wont stand for that bullshit.<br /><br />huge sweeping generalizations like this just show you obviously cannot think rationally at all and are a slave to your own emotions.<br /><br />besides sure some women can certainly be unfair on some men.. but in general men are the real selfish pigs who want nothing more than sex, power and someone to suck their cock.

I mean, American women act like a bunch of spoiled little brats and then they act surprised when men no longer want to put up with their bullshit?<br /><br />Now you may say &quot;There are some &quot;good&quot; women in America&quot;. Yes, but the term &quot;good&quot; is very relative. Even the so called &quot;good&quot; women in America can&#039;t compete with even an average quality woman from Asia or India. Try to understand that. Even the &quot;best&quot; women in America can&#039;t compete with even the most average of women from Southeast Asia.<br /><br />To put it into visual terms. It would be like a middle-weight bodybuilder trying to compete against heavy-weight bodybuilders.<br /><br />American women are simply out of their league when it comes to foreign women, because foreign women beat American women hands down in terms of attractiveness, beauty, loyalty, affection, honesty, and morality.<br /><br />So look man, I have put this into about as logical terms as you will find. It&#039;s up to you to accept the truth or not. If you are happy with your American woman? Then all power to you. Just don&#039;t come whining to me when you get ass raped in divorce or when she kidnaps your children from you and then relocates to an unknown location, and thus you lose custody and contact with your own children, and then you become so emotionally devastated that you end up committing suicide. I tried warning you, but you wouldn&#039;t listen.<br /><br />As for men who ARE willing to accept this truth? Come visit Southeast Asia (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam), or East Asia (Japan, Korea), and meet women in those countries. You will be AMAZED at the vast difference between Asian women and American women. It&#039;s literally like heaven and hell.

According to female logic, because a man doesn&#039;t want to bend over backwards and voluntarily allow some woman to ass rape him in divorce, he must be a &quot;woman hater&quot;.<br /><br />I guess by the same logic, anyone who doesn&#039;t allow a murderer to murder them must be a &quot;murderer hater&quot;.<br /><br />Then again, with women 40 percent more likely to develop mental illness than men, what can you expect?<br />http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2013/05/23/study-women-40-percent-more-likely-to-develop-mental-illness-than-men/<br /><br />The modern generation of women in America is the most selfish, narcissistic, disgusting filthy whores to ever exist. Sure, I have no problem fucking them. But if you expect me to marry one of these animals and start a family? You surely must be joking, right?

				My question is<br /><br />Why are American women so jealous of Asian women? I mean, if you American women are so &quot;big, strong, and independent&quot;, then why do you feel so threatened by Asian women? I guess you American women have a very low self esteem.

				I certainly am, but im not alone, its a fairly large percentage of males who cheat.

				Whenever a man speaks against feminism, almost the first thing women will say is &quot;Oh, you just can&#039;t get laid&quot;.<br /><br />In other words, women are basically admitting that they see men only in terms of value of sex.<br /><br />In fact, I haven&#039;t ever heard a woman talk about a man&#039;s value other than either as a financial provider or as a sex object.<br /><br />So while feminists claim that men objectify women as sex objects, actually it is the other way around.<br /><br />Women do not see men as human beings who have god-given rights, hence why women laugh at the very concept of the men&#039;s rights movement. No, women do not see men as humans. Women only see men as sperm doners and walking wallets. If a man decides to be anything other than a sperm donor or a walking wallet, he becomes useless to women and women show no interest in him.<br /><br />This is also why women absolutely hate the MRA and MGTOW movements. Because those movements are liberating men from the slavery of women, and telling men that they are HUMAN BEINGS with HUMAN RIGHTS. Women can&#039;t stand that, as they are biologically brainwashed to see men as having no value outside of either sex or money.<br /><br />Women are such vain, shallow, disgusting creatures, when you really begin to understand their true nature. Personally, I can&#039;t wait for the day when Female Sex-Robots and virtual reality sex replaces real human women and makes real human women obsolete. Real human women have become a threat to civilization and to technological advancement at this point. Just look at all the feminists and women demanding certain new technologies to be banned, simply because those technologies give men options. Fascism and anti-freedom is hardwired into a woman&#039;s biology. So I am saying that literally- women are a direct threat to civilization and progress at this stage and need to be replaced with technology and made obsolete, if we men want to have any hope of the human race progressing and evolving.<br /><br />MGTOW 4 life!!!

				I partially agree, I mean the culture here basically puts the man below a woman in a relationship.&nbsp; In my ideal situation both genders would be equal.&nbsp; I think that it really changes how the woman sees relationships/marriage, but, it really can&#039;t be applied to ALL american women. I know plenty of women who are quiete amazing people (even though im dating a German... LOL) and somehow resist letting themselves become what they hate the most despite all of the social pressure.

				Rambo is boycotting American women and suggesting we look to Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam for love connections. Sounds like a pedophile. I prefer grass on the field before i play ball. Sorry Rambo&nbsp; ;)

There are feminists like you describe out there, but those are fucked in the head individuals like the OP.

But as our society today is still highly patriarchic, women still need to &quot;catch up&quot; so yes: they should be privileged in some cases.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget that sexism is a bad thing for both sexes!

				So a man who decides to avoid marriage to a western woman is &quot;evil&quot;, while a woman can ass rape a man in divorce, kidnap his kids from him, and drive him to suicide, and this of course is not evil. It&#039;s because women can do no wrong, women are innocent little angels, and EVERYTHING is ALWAYS a MAN&#039;s fault.<br /><br />Right? That&#039;s what you manginas and feminists believe, correct?

				This is entertaining. OP does have a point though...product of circumstances. Women in the US seem insecure with being women..and playing the housewife role. Sure not EVERY woman has to cook and clean and do all that wife type shit...but thats basically what being a wife is supposed to be. And a mother. In America a women either wants to be the Father AND Mother, or she wants to be a princess in a fairytale Disney story. Thats what it is yo.
