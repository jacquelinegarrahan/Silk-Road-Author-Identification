				&nbsp;&gt;:(Ok i have orderd from him once in the past and yes i got and he would answer you when you sent him a mesg... now he acts like he does not&nbsp; see the mesg ,, that must be coming like fucking crazy at this point , So i have had my coins held for 10 days and nothing ok not a FUCKING word yet he comes on line to get his coins and sell more WEED to just hold up people money to then refund i do not see the point in this nor do i think he will be around much longer doing so . Look i dont care you think his shit dont stink , but myself and others are smelling a SHIT ok ... and yes things happen but when it shows everday you where last seen and you ignore your cust to me thats bad fucking BIZ plan and simple so unless you have more money than Bill Gates , then ok maybe you dont care ... But i have been fucked by my own doing in the PAST from trusting a vender to do as they say well big big mistake ok NEVER FE fuck that , and no i did not FE ok and ill never do it again for anyone so no matter what its in the rules to never FE so if there asking you to do that go to another vender keep looking there out and there cool i have made lots of good deals on here ok it can happen Be Safe and dont let some scam person FUCK you out of your hard earned money ... Its BULL SHIT .... AND DO not DO BIZ with Caliconnect ! thats my warning ok !

				so they&#039;ve narrowed it down to california? yeah, he&#039;s fucked.<br /><br />similar... recently ordered from a guy had talked to quite a bit. we agree, get money in, FE... happy.was expecting deliv soon, hasn&#039;t shipped. bc he hasn&#039;t heard from his guy yet! so i&#039;m a notch lower in all this, having money flipped, another variable is involved. kinda bummed, not what i signed up for. <br /><br />as long as shit goes safely i&#039;m ok with it. but can&#039;t keep any sort of commits on my side, makes a flake.
