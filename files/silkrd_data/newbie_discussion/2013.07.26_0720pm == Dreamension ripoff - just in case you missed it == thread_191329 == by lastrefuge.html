				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am curious as to why you do not reply to my messages and why you explained what I have copy and pasted below to me 10 days ago and now I am being told the same thing and to wait 10 days again? Can I get tracking information this time? I have about 4 hours to decide if I would like to extend my due date an additional 10 days. In the meantime you can pm me and I will reply promptly.<br /><br />Dreamension: &quot;Greetings friend !<br /><br />I have just officially returned to the &quot;Online&quot; bit of SR after resolving internal issues AND working on the Orders that were still in queue from before the temporary Pause<br /><br />It seems that your order has been one of to be caught into the whirlwind of chaos which was caused by our shipper leaving to help out with set-up of a festival a week ago and leaving myself to work on the orders still to go personally,<br />some orders were accidentally marked shipped before going on, and some were already pacakged but were not yet picked-up,<br />which was part of the reason for slight slow down in operations, and I did not have a second to reply to any PMs because it is a full-time work for me once I begin and I also had a BTC Exchange problem to deal with on the side which did not even allow me to turn Anything around for re-stock,<br /><br />It has been all cleared up now<br /><br />I tried to focus on completing all the orders first and resolving any last bits before I re-open for normal business and begin answering all the PMs<br /><br />Your order has been shipped out at the end of last week, instead of the end of the week previous, and I have included a gigantic extra bonus of product for you to balance it out<br /><br />This issue has been thoroughly documented and will not re-occur again<br /><br />Sincere apologies for this minor delay,<br />rest assured, I wanted to notify you as soon as possible and I will make it up to you so that both of us are happy<br /><br />Please expect the shipment to arrive in around 7 days from now to be safe :)<br /><br />Blessings &lt;3&quot; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealed1310 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 second<br />July 26, 2013, 10:57 pm UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked into and double checked your order personally,<br />your shipment has been upgraded to 150% of your original order Plus a generous bonus of my ultimate LSD has been included in it for absolutely free<br /><br />also we know have exact ETA for the arrival of your package, and it is being near the end of next week<br /><br />I have finally managed to get everything under control and will dedicate 24/7 of my time to SR again, plus will be bringing full and improved inventory back on the menu,<br />this peak of Summer has been extremely hard to deal with everything due to scorching heatwave and commitment to organization of many major Musical Festivals<br /><br />Blessings &lt;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />DReaMensioN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 hours<br />July 26, 2013, 3:47 pm UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept<br /><br /><br />100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel after trying to receive my two orders from Dreamension and waiting twice it is safe to say that if I do not receive my two orders by the due date of my extension that I would most likely never receive any orders I place with Dreamension. I have waited a very long time for an order which is advertised as Domestic which from what I read in the comments is not shipped Domestically as advertised. I have received very little communication and very poor response times to 1 out of three messages which has been replied to and my resolution requests. One of the reasons I place my orders with Dreamension was lightning fast answers to my various questions prior to placing my orders. I don&#039;t order internationally because I feel much more secure and have much more peace of mind when I place my orders from SR Domestically and I receive my orders very fast. I have never waited more than just a few days for a Domestic order and I have received every single order I placed Domestically. Honestly I am disappointing that I waited patiently twice and still after so much time has passed I still have not received my orders. Even Internationally...one out of two tries should be successful. I would like to request a full refund if I have not received my orders by the due date of my extensions.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Sealed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sealed1310 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 hours<br />July 26, 2013, 1:08 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reviewing your order and extending the due date<br />I will contact you personally via PM with more info statim &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />DReaMensioN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days<br />July 16, 2013, 6:37 am UTC &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old<br /><br /><br />100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am open to a full refund or free reship of the products I ordered.

				Get your money back, and order from a more reputable vendor who can get it to you in 2 - 3 days. It seems he doesn&#039;t have product and is waiting on some to ship. His problem not yours. Get out.

				*****EVERYONE PLEASE READ IF YOU GET YOUR ORDER DO NOT FINALIZE UNTIL YOU&#039;VE TRIED THE PRODUCT****<br /><br />I ordered 4 tabs on june 27th and marked shipped on June 30th. Reciveved 6 Tabs on 8/2 , all in one big rectangle I had to cut into the squares. We dosed at 11am on Saturday the 8/3. I am so f*cking glad I did not release payment after I saw it come. He asked for 10 more days 11 hours ago and if he had read his message inbox before that he would&#039;ve seen this message I sent him.<br /><br />(Here&#039;s the last message I sent to DreaMensioN last night)<br />Hey so your tabs showed up and none of them worked. I ate one waited an hour nothing, another waited an hour nothing and a third, my lightweight ~120 girlfriend who trips balls off of ~80mcg acid said she felt it but as much as she does when we makeout after i eat a tab for like 5 minutes so....the last 2 tabs went to Ehrlich&#039;s tests and so I put a small piece of one blotter into the vial with the liquid. I suspected the tabs weren&#039;t LSD (due to unpreforation, bitter taste and it affected us different than I would expect from LSD). After the blotter was in the liquid I took the wick out, look and it was defiantly not turning purple anytime soon and submerged it and it sucked up almost all the liquid. the wick changed to a light yellow color but that was about it. Since it was a 1 time only test kit, I squeezed the wick to try to put some of the liquid back into the vial and it was definitely yellow. No way it&#039;s acid. If you wanna go ahead and refund me 100% i&#039;ll say i got great acid and ill praise you like a good at this point. It&#039;s been a month waiting and im half an hour late because I needed to type this out now. Just do the right thing and cut your losses. Thanks and hopefully this is the last message like this I&#039;ll have to send.<br /><br /><br />(Last message I sent in my resolution, still haven&#039;t released payments and he keeps asking for max time each time)<br />&nbsp; Product had already arrived, it is unpreforated tabs that are not real acid. I did a 3 of them at a time and barely felt anything. I felt like it was a weak research chemical and my friends who trip off half a tab of street ~100mcg acid took two each and they felt nothing at all. The paper also tasted like blank paper with a small amount of what appears to be part of the NBOMe series. This entire order is ridiculous. If I have to wait 10 more days or they believe you again (even though at least 10 other people on the community forums are saying the same)&nbsp; I will personally spend all my time making sure no one will ever buy from you again. I am letting you keep 10% because I pity you. You sold a false product and was a month late on supplying it. So you lied to the customer in two ways. Accept this offer or your feedback and forums will definitely take a blow. If he still is pushing for more time on all his clients then he must be waiting for these orders in resolution to finish so he can get out of here quick. Dealers that take a month to deliver a product that shouldn&#039;t have taken more then a week. Also, only 1 vacuum seal instead of three like you advertise. Maybe it was real acid and your inability to properly store, ship and protect your merchandise is what broke 4 of out 6 of them. One has been tested and came up yellow on an Ehrlich&#039;s regent test. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Staff- There are 5 topics in the forums totaling 11 pages all about DReaMensioN and buyers like me who he is ripping off. Do not let him wait any longer because he&#039;s sending out fake tabs and once people get them, they&#039;ll finalize before trying anything and he&#039;ll have made so much money with just this ripoff scheme, seems like he has at least 15 people in resolution and once these fake tabs come on Monday and people start to finalize i guarantee he&#039;ll be gone.<br /><br />P.S.- Yes, I know I am copy pasta this on all of his threads but I hope that atleast one person will not just finilize when they see the letter. Buy a test kit amazon, its cheap, you get 10 tests and its really easy way to tell if your getting acid or not....Thanks!<br /><br />~skrill3xx/onlyAJJ/AndrewJacksonJihad/skrill3x

				indeed, i&#039;ve encountered issues with said vendor -- it&#039;s been nearly a month -- the irregularity of the service and the curious antics should give anyone considering dreamension pause prior to engaging in business<br /><br />i like to give people the benefit of the doubt - but until all the errant orders are resolved and the 1 ratings are turned to 5s, heed the warnings

				I would love to get my money back - good luck with that. Every time the resolution is about to expire, Dreamension sends me a message thru the resolution center that my order has been shipped - so Silk Road keeps extending it another 10 days.<br />He has told me definitively my order has been shipped 3 times now - each time the day before the resolution expires.<br /><br />I thought escrow was to protect us from this exact thing - not so - buyer beware. It has been over a month and all that happens is they keep extending it by 7 or 10 days. I have sent them copies of the messages this time where he said he has shipped my items - 3 times, asking for a 100% refund. I am not very hopeful of getting my money back and I think you can bank on me never seeing any product.<br />Each time he ups the ante - this last time he also included a bunch of his &quot;great acid&quot;..........is pretty easy to give stuff away when you never actually ship anything.<br />Nothing but a headache<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion he does this hoping I miss logging on the day the resolution expires so Silk Road will release the money to him. He just keeps saying he shipped, with an even bigger bonus each time and sooner or later I might miss the end date and he gets paid......<br />he is nothing more than a thief as far as I am concerned. He has been proven to be a liar as he has definitively told me my order has been shipped 3 times now

				I am still experiencing the same thing as the above post. Over a month waiting with no product and being told product was just shipped with bonus each time. SR resolution staff...please take this forum post into consideration before extending the due date again. Extending the due date once for a domestic order is more than enough times. Too bad that was also a lie and when Dreamension actually ships its mostly from Canada which is not domestic. This alone should be enough for a 100% refund of my two orders from Dreamension. I would never have placed the order if Dreamension had been upfront with his listing about international vs domestic shipping. I never order internationally and had I known I would never have even placed my order to begin with.

				I too never received my MDA ordered from Dreamension on 06/11/2013 hoping to receive it within the next week for my Bday celebration.&nbsp; I was promised the following after being told that my order shipped on 2 different occasions; the first time was 5 weeks ago, and the last promise was 10 days ago, and still no package.&nbsp; This is my first loss on SR, and it hurts.&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />Dreamension&#039;s last 2 Messages regarding my order:<br /><br />&quot;One more thing, please do not mention anything about refund or reship in the feedback, too many scammers could be reading it !<br /><br />Thanks&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Greetings !<br /><br />Excuse me for delayed response, I have just gotten back to dedicating my 24/7 time to SR again :)<br /><br />You are already marked in my reship book and your address is updated to the fresh verified one provided<br /><br />I would like to reship 150% to you of your original order + some of my amazing LSD as a bonus<br /><br />I will make sure your reship goes out this weekend and should arrive to you at the end of this week,<br />it is very very stealthy in and out<br /><br />Blessings &lt;3&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m giving up hope :-(

				and another day passes and still nothing in the mail.<br />SR did say if I do not receive it by Friday they will refund my money.<br />They said it has taken so long because basically they want to be sure who is at fault. I understand they must deal with some strange things, but I do not see how there is any mistaking this one since. <br />At least this headache should be over by Friday - tho now I have major surgery in 2 weeks so it will be too late to order anything else.<br /><br />Tho I wonder if we should start taking bets if dreamension now changes his tune and instead of twelling us a 4th time it<br /><br />Of course now Dreamension will probably change his song and dance and instead of telling us a 4th time he has shipped the order, will now say he did ship so must have got lost in the mail.......

				just occurred to me - this idiot has our home addresses and has had them for over a month.<br />A vendor is supposed to delete them immediately - since he keeps telling us he shipped our items, that means he has not deleted our addresses.<br />Not the guy I feel comfortable with having my address and knowing he has not deleted them yet.<br /><br />
