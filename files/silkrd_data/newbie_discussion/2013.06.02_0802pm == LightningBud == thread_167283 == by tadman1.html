				Got my first order from this guy, only two pre rolled spliffs but straight from the Netherlands to UK. was wary as a new member, never used SR before, but this guy really helped me out :) made it easy and in no time at all i had my spliffs :) went to make another order and chatted with the guy a bit, he made me up a listing and i ordered a few grams of what i had tasted. made an order at the same time as my first order but ordered from UK (thinking it would be a dead cert, quicker too) am still waiting on my UK delivery!!! Hoping it will be here tuesday... looks like a vendors selling stats aren&#039;t everything! UK guy has very high stats, thats a big reason why i went to him in the first place, LightningBud had only been active a few months so i was more wary but as it turned out stats meant nothing.&nbsp; im not saying the stats system is bad, its really a good idea, just saying that they aren&#039;t the &#039;be all and end all&#039;. I&#039;m pretty sure my UK vendor will sort things out. i guess its a bit like big commercial shops verses the smaller ones on the high street. smaller businesses have more time to talk to and care for the customers whereas the bigger, more busy businesses are a bit more faceless... have had no replies from him at all! due to unforseen circumstance no doubt but still, a message to reassure wouldnt go amiss...
