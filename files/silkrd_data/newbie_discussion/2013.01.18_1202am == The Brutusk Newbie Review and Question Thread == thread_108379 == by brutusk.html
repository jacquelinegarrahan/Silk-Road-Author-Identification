				BRUTUSK! Just the man I&#039;m looking for. All set up to buy an ounce from you :)<br /><br />JHerer for $225 thats amazing.<br /><br />But I got $227.33 and the btc market got fucked so I have now 14.55BTC and your price is 14.84BTC. SO CLOSE CMON BTC MARKET. lol. Watchin like a hawk so I can get this at the right time.<br /><br />I&#039;m not asking for a different price, please dont think that. I read up, its a quick way to get to the bad buyer list. I&#039;m just saying I&#039;m super fucking excited and thank you for posting in the newbie forum. I hear you have the greatest bang for your buck with bud. I plan on ordering tonight, or early tomorrow (before 10am EST). If i do, will it ship tomorrow as well?

				Hi everyone, thanks for your continued support!<br /><br />Just a few quick things:<br /><br />1. I&#039;ve been having major time-out issues getting onto SR the last few days, so please be patient with messages and processing orders<br />2. I&#039;m starting to iron out the wrinkles in the new PO system, so things should start moving faster over the next few weeks<br />3. March 3 is my 1 year anniversary...and I will be having a 24 hour sale to celebrate! I won&#039;t reveal the details just yet, but count on 24 hours of great pricing PLUS a new product that will only be available during my anniversary sale. Get your coins ready, sale will start at midnight SR time. I will release more details at the end of the month.<br /><br />B

				My oz of JH was more than 30g.&nbsp; Quality:Price ratio was absolutely phenomenal.&nbsp; As a midwesterner,&nbsp; it was legitimately the best deal I&#039;ve ever got in my life. The pics posted in the main thread don&#039;t even do it justice.&nbsp; Great job Brutusk.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to the PN i ordered.

I also had some pineapple express at the time which is supposed to be a top tier strain and everybody I smoked with said they liked the jack way better. PE was good quality, too. You can&#039;t go wrong with brutusk. The dude is legit.
