				This makes me glad I didn&#039;t use them. What are you doing paying those ungodly fees anyway? I was about to use them until I found LibertyCoin. There&#039;s a link in my sig, he&#039;s only charging 6% right now. He doesn&#039;t have any reviews/listings on SR yet but if you go to his review thread you&#039;ll see that he&#039;s legit. I&#039;ve used him outside of SR through email and the transaction went without a hitch, had my BTC in my SR account fast and cheap.<br /><br />I have no idea about MoneyPak Trader. I wouldn&#039;t use him unless I absolutely had to, his fees are insane. LibertyCoin accepts MP&#039;s, that&#039;s how I paid for mine.

				I&#039;ve had the BTC for a while now, I don&#039;t use him anymore due to the outrageous fees. It looks like he only allows you to purchase Btc with MP and sell BTC for cash/reloads but does not allow you to transfer the BTC to a separate account. Total bullshit if you ask me. lol

Where are they, kept on his website? That sounds like some scamming shit if you ask me.
