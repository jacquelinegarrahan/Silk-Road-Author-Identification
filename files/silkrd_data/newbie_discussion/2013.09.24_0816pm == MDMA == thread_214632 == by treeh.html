				I think Dutch Deal has no Pgp key which is weird, was going to order his 0.25g sample but not without the security.<br /><br />Saint Nic has a high purity according to the MDMA Avengers thread, managed to get a sample before his test came back and his price on the gram went WAAAAAAAAaaay up. Have tasted a tiny bit but not properly yet.<br /><br />Sukey had high percentage acetone wash as well, and cheaper, about â‚¬30 a gram<br /><br />Haizenburg is in CZ and is supposed to have nice mdma but his review thread is all over the place at the moment so i&#039;m not going to order until it&#039;s smooth again, seems like they have new employees or something messing things up.<br /><br />Lots of reviews on MDMA avengers thread. If I was ordering again I might look at TripSitter (TripSitters?) just because I had a good feeling (like I had with Saint Nic before his wash test showed good result)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129424.0<br /><br /><br /><br />Got burned by 4sale before he left, SR refunded
