				So I&#039;m finally out of the window shopping stage, I&#039;ve acquired my coins, and now I&#039;m ready to buy.<br /><br />In the Buyers Guide it says that everything is already encrypted, so there&#039;s no need to worry when you add your name and address to the box below the shopping cart.<br /><br />But do you always PGP your details in that box just in case? A friend of mine who told me about SR said he never has so just wondering your thoughts on it.

				Use PGP. You&#039;ll be a lot better of if SR is compromised some time in the future. Without the private key of the vendor, that info is useless to law enforcement

				When the buyer&#039;s guide says everything is encrypted, it probably means the hard drive is encrypted. That won&#039;t matter much if the FBI seizes the server. A lot of people PGP encrypt their addresses on top of the encryption that SR provides based on the tiny chance the server could be identified and seized. That reality has become starkly more clear after the Freedom Hosting server was busted.

				People use PGP so that even if all of the info on Silk Road were to fall into the hands of LE, your name/address would still be protected from them. It&#039;s very important to take every security measure within reason to protect that sort of extremely sensitive information. Let&#039;s hope that NEVER happens -- but IF it does, you want to be on the safe side.

				Another reason to use PGP is that some vendors have fallen for phishing sites and their accounts were compromised. If someone else logs into the vendor&#039;s account, they can see all the unencrypted addresses of recently submitted orders. That creates a liability for buyers. The info could be used to dox or blackmail buyers.<br />

				Excellent point, Tanamon. I think the underlying point here is that you can never be -too- safe when your very freedom and well-being are on the line.

				Always encrypt... Always, always, always.<br />When in doubt, encrypt. It&#039;s much better to be safe than sorry

				just stay off the road if you can&#039;t understand why encrypting your shipping address is necessary.<br /><br />that&#039;s just asking the po-po to come knocking down your door.&nbsp; very reckless.
