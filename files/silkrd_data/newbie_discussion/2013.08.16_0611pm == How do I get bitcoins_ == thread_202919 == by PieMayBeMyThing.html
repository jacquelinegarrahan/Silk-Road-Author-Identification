				I know this has probably been posted here before but for some reason the Search Bar won&#039;t let me search anything - it says my last search was 5 seconds ago though the only time I&#039;ve tried was for this question. Anyways, how do I go about getting Bitcoins? I understand I should go through a third party vendor and such, so what I&#039;m really asking is: how do I trade USD for Bitcoins and make it 1. untraceable to me, 2. ensure I don&#039;t get scammed, and 3. get the best exchange rate? <br /><br />I appreciate any help in advance guys!

				You&#039;re never going to be assured of all three things.&nbsp; You have to balance them and make educated decisions.<br /><br />For maximum anonymity with a relatively low chance of a ripoff, find someone with great feedback on localbitcoins.com and set up a face-to-face transaction.

Of course this depends on the seller but I&#039;m just asking to see if that actually happens. Also, how do I ensure that this person gives me my bitcoins? Do I just make sure he has a computer with him during the transaction and watch as I get my bitcoins?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading over a ton of information on Bitcoins but am still confused on how this Bitcoin Wallet thing is done. I know it pertains to the use of &quot;addresses&quot; (which look like URLs to me); but I don&#039;t know how to use it or even set up a wallet. I ask because I&#039;d like to ensure that this vendor I&#039;m meeting face to face can&#039;t show me on his computer that he&#039;s transferred the bitcoins to an address and then as soon as I leave move the bitcoins from that address to somewhere else. <br /><br />I hope my question makes sense and thanks for answering the first ones! :D

				They might use a phone to transfer the coins also , once they start the process to your wallet it will show it coming in pretty quick,

				I know there are some local businesses that do exchange for USD...but is there a legit danger of being traced from there?<br /><br />Cannot prove that I bought something here right? It would suck to get scammed from the beginning trying to get bitcoin so I am drawn to go the safe route for that

				I used localbitcoins.com to arrange a face-to-face meeting. I handed him the money, he sent a text to localbitcoins.com and I got an email confirmation in literally 2 seconds. I verified it was in the account and that was that. It was all a little surreal but in the end it went really smoothly.

				I can exchange USD for bitcoin if you are still in need. Check my vendor page for more info. I am offering a very favorable 15% bonus for my next 3 customers. If you are interested let me know and I can give you more details.
