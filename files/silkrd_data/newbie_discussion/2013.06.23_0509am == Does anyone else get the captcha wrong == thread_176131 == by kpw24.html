				I type the letters correctly and it keeps saying I&#039;m typing the wrong letters. I tried caps and lowercase too. <br /><br />I&#039;m not stupid, I know I typed it in right. I literally have to try 15+ times and usually I just give up. <br />I quit and relaunched the tor browser multiple times, I tried using a new identity but nope, still the same results. <br /><br />It&#039;s so frustrating! Can someone let me know what&#039;s going on?

				glad i could help! i was so frustrated, i had many things to say but no way to post them!<br /><br />here is what the linked post says, for easy reference<br /><br />&quot;<br />so i searched the forum and realized that others were having this same problem, but no one ever posted a response.<br /><br />for some reason even though I enter the image verification correctly every time, it wouldn&#039;t work for the life of me, whether i listened to the letters or just clicked request another image<br /><br />i FINALLY found what works<br /><br />drag the letters (the graphics box) into a new tab, different letters will show up from whats on the reply site. use the letters from the new tab<br /><br />should work now<br />&quot;

The CAPTCHA wouldn&#039;t prevent this anyway - you don&#039;t need to be logged in to read the forums. <br /><br />And boloro is right: after 100 posts there&#039;s no CAPTCHA required to post. (Tho obv you need it to log in). It&#039;s a nice benefit.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />To anyone using onion.to - you are SERIOUSLY compromising your anonymity. onion.to is a proxy service that enables you to browse .onion sites without using TOR. I have no idea who runs it, but you visit any onion pages thru them they&#039;ll have access to your IP address (and if you enter any login info they&#039;ll have that too). If you use onion.to thru the TBB you&#039;re somewhat more protected, but even so onion.to is not a good idea.

				@Lorimer - Thanks for correcting my misconception about not thinking that the number of posts is relevant to having to type the CAPTCHA or not :) .&nbsp; I&#039;m not that much of an enthusiastic forum poster, but looks like I might as well get on those last 30 or so posts.. lol..<br /><br />As far as the fact that I said the CAPTCHA was to prevent search engines from indexing these pages on the clearnet..&nbsp; &nbsp;I think I partly worded that wrong, and partly just plain don&#039;t completely understand something about that.&nbsp; I know that you can google &quot;silkroad&quot; and a number of other hidden services by their website name and that they will show up in a google search (and probably other search engines as well), with descriptions and even sometimes screenshots, and even the .onion address in some of them.&nbsp; Pretty sure SR shows the .onion address on the clearnet.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I guess where I get somewhat confused is regarding these pages being indexed to the clearnet yet not really accessible from there...&nbsp; obviously one can&#039;t use the .onion address even if it&#039;s in front of them and get anywhere using it from a search result on the clearnet..&nbsp; so, even though a person can find these pages in search results and read about them, they pretty much can&#039;t actually access them w/o going on TOR..&nbsp; &nbsp;unless of course they get in through the website of the unknown and possibly evil owner that allows access with no anonyminity by adding the .to extention [which you and others have pointed out and it can&#039;t be stressed enough not to do it].&nbsp; Don&#039;t know enough about TOR2Web to comment on that...&nbsp; but anyway, now I know that the CAPTCHA isn&#039;t intended for what I thought it was and I thank you for that. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />
