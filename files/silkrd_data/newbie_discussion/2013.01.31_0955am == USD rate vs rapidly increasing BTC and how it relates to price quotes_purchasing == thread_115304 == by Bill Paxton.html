				Hello all.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been lurking around Silk Road since my buddy&#039;s friend (who&#039;s in the military) told us about it and its obvious amazing advantages.&nbsp; The area I live in has had HORRIBLE MDMA either in &quot;molly&quot; form or pressed pills which started a while ago but came to full swing in about 2008 to where we just simply couldnt find real shit anymore with our test kits... I had all but given up.&nbsp; &nbsp;ALL the pressed pills we seem to come across are piperzine/dxm or something worse... I found out a few years ago people were (and still are!!) selling fucking methaloyne as MDMA to kids who&#039;ve never rolled before... I felt so bad watching these youngsters try and conjure up a good vibe like I&#039;ve always had handed to me from good pure X..Made me feel bad for them, and it kinda grossed me out. Anyways, the ability to find good choice MDMA/Pressies pretty much gave me an erection lasting more than a week so I knew I had to place an order.&nbsp; I finally placed my first order wtih Off The Wagon this week and am expecting it any day now (yippie)... Sorry, felt the need to give you a little back story plus its in the wee hours of the morning here so I&#039;m comfortably buzzed. <br /><br />QUESTION:&nbsp; When a seller says to you, (And I&#039;m sort of half making up numbers here so bare with me): I have MDMA and I sell it at $60.00 /gram all day every day no matter what the btc exchange rate is at so you&#039;ll be paying the USD amount (60.00) and we&#039;ll convert that to whatever the btc is sitting at... The concept is rock solid, there&#039;s nothing I don&#039;t understand about it.<br /><br />What I do not understand is how that actually works when you do place an order.&nbsp; For instance, I want to buy a gram of special K right now and its listed on a vender&#039;s site as 4.44btc which equals out to about $84.00 given the current exchange rate.&nbsp; If this seller says, &quot;1 gram of K is only $55.00&quot; then how does that work out when I go to buy it?&nbsp; Do I place my order with it being 4.44btc but the vender will change it to say 3.05btc so that I&#039;d only end up paying about $55.00 usd?? I mean with a gram of K being $84.00 today and the exchange rate&#039;s going the way they are, tomorrow night at this time, that same gram of K is going to cost me about $90.00 ... <br /><br />I&#039;m assuming you all understand my confusion? Do I need to get venders to put up special orders for me just so I don&#039;t get screwed with the exchange rate? Do I need to stay in contact with them to get them to change the BTC listing price to better meet the USD?? Do most sellers change their rates daily?? I&#039;ve noticed that the average BTC price for a gram of MDMA was about 5.00btc a few weeks ago but with the bitcoin rising the price is around 4.05btc for a gram of MDMA .... Should I do all the things I&#039;m suggesting? Contact Vender, ask about special order, ask about the price being changed to reflect changes in the market etc... or do they just take whats needed and my account gets credited whats left over? <br /><br />Sorry, I am a newb and am finding my way around here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everything I&#039;ve seen and heard is just awesome. I love the over all idea/concept of silk road.&nbsp; I hope this website never gets shut down as I believe people should be able to order/do whatever they want opening.&nbsp; We all already get these drugs we want to do in the end so why not make a great place to get them where we (the buyers) and the sellers talk openly and honestly about product quality etc... I feel alot more honesty on this website than I do buying my MDMA/Coke/Ketamine off the street... Shit always gets cut up and quality is never what you want. I understand people get burned, and packages sometimes don&#039;t arrive for whatever the reason.&nbsp; Really the only thing i&quot;m hesitant about is placing VERY LARGE orders one right after another... if one LARGE ORDER doesn&#039;t make it to me, for whatever the reason, it could bring my little side business hooking up my friends to a very quick stop. The mark up on drugs on here is so high, its pretty much what most would pay on the street. That is, depending on where you live.&nbsp; Where I live there&#039;s a horrible shortage of good quality MDMA whether its in pill or raw form so thats something I can order, mark up, sell for a profit and at a price that people are more than happy to pay.&nbsp; all the Pharmies RX stuff we can get WAAAAY cheaper in my area so no reason to use the road for that.&nbsp; I know traveling DJs LOVE Silk Road ... An artist just put out a electronic music track release called &quot;Silk Roads&quot; and the other track is called &quot;dr. hoffman&quot; if I&#039;m not mistaken... He&#039;s an international DJ world renown: Steve Lawler .. Google him, you&#039;ll see :)<br /><br />Sorry for rambling.&nbsp; Please answer my question about exchange rates and how logistics play part in purchasing/paying correct USD amount and not getting butt rapped by the seemingly ever rising BTC... shits gone from arond 12.00 - 19.00 in just the last 4-5 months by my crude calculations (done by memory)..<br /><br />Hope to hear from some of you fellow substance users soon!!!<br /><br />Much love and LONG LIVE THE SILK ROAD!!!!!<br /><br />-Bill Paxton (FL)<br />
