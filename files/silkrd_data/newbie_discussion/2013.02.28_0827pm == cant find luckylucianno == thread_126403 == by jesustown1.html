				so iv searched for luckylucianno on sr a couple times this week and i cant find his vender page, whats up with this? i kinda mainly just wanna know if he has a 10 g listing for molly, how much it is, and when i would be able to order it. iv seen alot of good things about his molly along with cloudsurfers but neither have listings up right now. i loved cousinmollys stuff but im looking into bulk for a friend, he wants the best stuff i can get and i just want to make sure i dont lose his money with a shady vender. so basically my questions are-<br />1. wheres luckyluciannos vender page?<br />2. price for 10 g listings for lucky and cloudsurfer? (if possible)<br />3. when will they be back? (i know this is probly asked alot but any info is appreciated)<br />and on another note..<br />why the fuck do people like speed so much? like i was perscribed dexedrine as a kid and used to feel beyond shitty after it wore off. and that was at like 5-20 mg dosages, i cant even imagine how a recreationally dosed hangover would feel.

				Ok scout.&nbsp; If JessusTown couldn&#039;t find him, he damn sure wasn&#039;t looking hard enough.&nbsp; Poor attempt at humor on my part.&nbsp; My compliments to all of the higher ups for their handling that situation.&nbsp; As well as the handling of the multiple deposit glitch.&nbsp; Your updates were timely &amp; informative during a ?able moment on the road.<br /><br />&quot;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What else do you want to know?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would like to know your personal opinion on the &quot;supposed&quot; weight similarities between the Fla bust &amp; the New Orleans bust.&nbsp; You know, just for shits &amp; giggles.&nbsp; Or has that subject already been discussed somewhere else &amp; my ignorant newb soul just hasn&#039;t gleaned it yet?&nbsp; Or is it not up for discussion &amp; I &#039;m just to stupid to realize it? <br /><br />
