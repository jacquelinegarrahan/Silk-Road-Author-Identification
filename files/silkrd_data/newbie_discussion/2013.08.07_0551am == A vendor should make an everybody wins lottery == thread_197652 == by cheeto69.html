				Lotteries on SR kind of suck because your odds of winning are terrible, and even if you do win you usually don&#039;t get very much.<br /><br />Instead, a vendor should put up a lottery where everyone is a winner, you just get something random depending on the last digit of your order ID. Sometimes you would get more than what you paid for, sometimes less. For example, you could have a Drug Lottery that costs .5 BTC to enter, and could look like this:<br /><br />0: 2x 120ug LSD blotters<br />1: 5x 120ug LSD blotters<br />2: 10x 120ug LSD blotters<br />3: 1g mushrooms<br />4: 3.5g mushrooms<br />5: 8g mushrooms<br />6: .5 grams MDMA<br />7: 1 gram MDMA<br />8: 2 grams MDMA<br />9: 3.5 gram weed<br />A:&nbsp; 7 grams weed<br />B: 14 grams weed<br />C: 100mg DMT<br />D: 500mg DMT<br />E: 1 gram DMT<br />F: 1 gram mescaline<br /><br />Those prices are probably a bit off but you get what I mean. Or maybe like, an LSD vendor could do an LSD lottery where you get as many LSD tabs as you roll, so 0 will get you 0 LSD tabs and an F will get you 16 LSD tabs.<br /><br />I dunno, I&#039;m kinda high right now so this might actually be a terrible idea, but I just thought I should put it out there.

				Well obviously you would tell the person what you&#039;re mailing them - it would be pretty bad if you thought you were parachuting mushrooms and ended up with a gram of DMT in your stomach.

				Seems like what you&#039;re really talking about a &quot;grab bag&quot;.<br /><br />The concept seems unattractive since...what, everyone buys a ticket for $50 and gets $50 of a random drug?<br /><br />Seems like a bitch and a half for the vendor for little to no profit.

If you base your product quantities around the price of entering a lotto, you&#039;ll always break even thanks to statistics!

				The grab bag thing was just one idea. Like I said, another potential lotto would be getting the amount of LSD tabs that your ticket number ends in. Another idea could be setting the lotto entry price at what you want to charge for 7 grams of weed, then sending as many grams as your order number ends in. But the vendor always breaks even, because of statistics!
