				Just thought I&#039;d throw this out there for those of you deciding to make your first purchase from. Xinhai hooked me up generously and then even offered me some freebies despite the fact that he was the first vendor I ordered from. I got one of his sample packs and all I can say is that it was very well worth it&#039;s cost.<br /><br />As with all good vendors no FE here, not even for newbies.<br /><br />

I&#039;m all about my oil rig but I like to vape flower materials from time to time in my Volcano (Which I&#039;m trying to sell). Purchased the Darkflower Hash and a few oil syringes, and it was fantastic. <br /><br />The Darkflower Hash: It is the shit&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; It has is a terrifically smooth smoke and very unique presentation and marketing. I get quite a few volcano bags on a very small chunk. It can also go on the TI nail but the resin leaves residue. <br /><br />The oil is also nice, i put it in the Micro G and Vape on the go, no one ever knows what I&#039;m doing lol&nbsp; ::)

Then out of the blue he cancelled my fourth.<br />After a couple days I was like &quot;WTF. I really liked that oil&quot; So I PM&#039;d him to tell him I was butt hurt and to see if it was just a snafu or if he just didn&#039;t want to deal with me. I got a response in broken English saying it was all good and to place an order for whatever i wanted. <br />If there is a language barrier, that would explain some of the lack of communication. As far as the cancellation thing. Eh, shit happens.

				I ordered xinhais sample pack. I was going to write a rave review after smoking some of the caviar. Until I found a rubber weight? or grommet or rubber something inside the 2nd biggest piece of caviar I got.<br /><br />WTF I almost smoked a piece of rubber. I need to fucking know if this was an accident or if he&#039;s skimping people with rubber weights wrapped in hash for some reason. Nobody else has mentioned this.<br />I inspected the other piece of caviar that I hadn&#039;t smoked yet and no rubber weight but I pulled it apart and it doesn&#039;t seem like its a bud that was dipped in oil. It seems like the whole thing is hash.<br /><br />I need a quality check on the caviar from someone else. I&#039;m pretty pissed right now. I don&#039;t think I smoked any rubber or I would have noticed it. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried the bubble or oil yet.
