				Jumbo monkey biscuit is by far the best person to use for bitcoins. Don&#039;t be scared to send cash in mail. THIS IS NOT A SCAM. One of the most reliable vendors on sr.&nbsp; btc always processes same day cash is received. JMB is the only way to go. all I use. Super helpful with any questions. Check it out.

				only problem with JMB is he takes a pretty good chunk of your BTC as a fee, i switched to cryptokeeper, just as reliable but he takes less of a cut, i use reloadit cards though

				I agree JumboMonkeyBiscuit is the man/woman.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used their service many times and the last time I used him he was at almost 2000 transactions and every single one of them was a 5/5.&nbsp; He also has a phenomenal number of fans.&nbsp; This means a lot to me since it&#039;s the only thing a customer taking the plunge can go by.&nbsp; <br /><br />FYI to those still using reloads as payment for bitcoin...&nbsp; &nbsp;I loved using reloads, but it&#039;s just not safe anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reload companies are now tracking the zip code and store location where every single reload is purchased. Store surveillance is all LE needs to get a visual identification on someone.&nbsp; May be a long shot, but it is what it is. Sending cash in mail is the most anonymous way of purchasing bitcoin since, but you can&#039;t just trust anyone.&nbsp; I love Jumbo! I&#039;m way more comfortable sending completely untraceable cash with an untraceable return addy in an envelope I can drop in a box without facing a postal clerk.&nbsp; The travel and details involved with Jumbo&#039;s impeccable service is well worth his 10% fee...Personally, I do pretty large amounts and he works with me on the rate.&nbsp; I also have the peace of mind knowing I&#039;m working with one of the most trusted vendors on SR.
