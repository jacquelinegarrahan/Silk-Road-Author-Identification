				My Name is HotCrossBuns and im an idoit.<br /><br />I have been trying to get my head round GPGtools for mac to talk securely etc etc<br /><br />So far I have downloaded and installed the software all good. <br /><br />Now what happened when I signed in is it automatically started a new key for me<br />using information from my computer that has been there since I set up, so I had a key with my<br />personal email address and name! not what I wanted. I can remove this key and create another one,<br />I don&#039;t see how I then get my public key code to share online!<br /><br />Is there any decent tutorials or websites that look at GPGtools on mac as the ones I looked at didn&#039;t help.<br /><br />Lastly... What about using Jaitsi as a secure way of chatting? or Adium or Alzip I find them to be really easy to use...<br /><br />Sorry for the load of info, if you can help out a newbie wanna be stonedbie that would be awesome!!!!!<br /><br />Love And Hotcrossbuns xx

				The following is Guru&#039;s Mac Tutorial on PGP.<br /><br /><br />====================<br /><br />GPGTools is highly version dependent -- depending on which version of OS X you have, it may or may not work as expected.&nbsp; If you have Leopard (10.5) then you&#039;re pretty much out of luck. Your only option then will be using the command-line.<br /><br />If you have Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), the<br />following instructions should be sufficient to allow you to get up and<br />running.<br /><br />Download and install GPGTools: http://nightly.gpgtools.org/GPGTools_Installer-trunk.dmg<br /><br />Once you have installed GPGTools,&nbsp; what you want to do is to go into<br />System Preferences --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Services.<br /><br />Scroll down until you find the following entries. Be sure to put a check mark in the boxes to activate each keyboard shortcut.<br /><br />Keyboard shortcuts:<br />===============<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Import Key from Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-I<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Fingerprint:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-F<br /><br />OpenPGP: Insert My Key:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shift-Command-K<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign Selection:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shift-Command-R<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of Selection: Shift-Control-V<br /><br />Remember, these shortcuts only operate on highlighted or selected text.<br /><br />N.B.: To properly be able to import PGP into GPGChain (via TextEdit) you need to change the default on TextEdit from .rtf to plain text. You can do that through the Format menu, or you can go through the main configuration menu, accessible by using Command-comma. Ensure the plain text radio button is selected.<br /><br />Also ensure that the following are UNCHECKED in TextEdit preferences: smart quotes, smart dashes, smart links.<br /><br />To select text within TextEdit, use Command-A to highlight the entire document, or use your mouse to selection the section that you want to<br />verify/sign/encrypt/decrypt. It is highly recommended that you use only plain-text, as opposed to Rich Text (.rtf) format. Use Command-comma to<br />bring up Preferences and ensure that the plain text radio button is checked.<br /><br />Once your text is highlighted in TextEdit, (by pressing Comand-A) you then encrypt using Shift-Command-E. You will then be presented with a list of keys to encrypt to, that you have added to your PGP keyring:<br /><br />Other Commands You May Need:<br />=========================<br /><br />OpenPGP: Decrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-D<br /><br />OpenPGP: Encrypt File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-E<br /><br />OpenPGP: Sign File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Control-Command-S<br /><br />OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Control-Command-V<br /><br /><br />Once you have setup these shortcuts, you can begin using GPG.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to someone using GPG, you first need a copy of the recipient&#039;s PGP public key.<br /><br />Once you have located someone&#039;s PGP public key, you should copy and paste it into TextEdit. Save the PGP key to a file; you can call the file,<br />import.asc (or import.txt), for example. This saved file will usually be found in the Documents folder.<br /><br />Launch GPG Keychain Access from the Applications folder. click on the Import icon in the upper left hand corner. GPG Keychain Access will then<br />prompt you for the name of the file which contains the key to import. It will usually show you a list of files in the Documents folder. Click on the<br />file named import.asc (or import.txt), and click ok. The PGP public key will then be imported into your PGP keyring.<br /><br />To encrypt a message to a person, the message must be contained in a TextEdit document. Use Command-A to hightlight the entire document. Then use Shift-Command-E to encrypt. GPG will pop-up a list of public keys in your PGP keyring. Each key will have a little checkbox beside it which you can check, to select that particular key. If you were encrypting a message to me, you would put a check in the box beside my PGP key (Nightcrawler@SR).<br /><br />When you click on OK, the plaintext (unencrypted) message in TextEdit will be replaced with the encrypted message. You can then copy and paste the encrypted message to enter it into a form on Silk Road, or anywhere else that it needs to go.<br /><br />To decrypt a message sent to you by other people, you need to copy that message to the clipboard, and paste it into a TextEdit document. Again use Command-A to highlight all the encrypted message. Then use Shift-Command-D to decrypt the message. If the message is encrypted to your PGP public key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once the correct passphrase has been entered, and you click OK, then the message will be decrypted, and the decrypted text will be placed in the TextEdit document, replacing the encrypted message that was there previously.<br />

				I have figured out how to encrypt and decrypt my own message but say all of these PGP messages I see floating around, I&#039;m able to get the key to import but unable to decrypt any type of message.... I&#039;m completely unsure where I am messing up. Also on the message that was released by DPR, I was unable to import anything from that and thus unable to decrypt it.... so also unsure what I am doing wrong there.

You&#039;re not able to decrypt other people&#039;s messages because you don&#039;t have the right private key.<br />2. You need to join PGP Club, and read the first few pine posts in the original PGP Club thread to get your head straight on how it works.<br />3. You are not supposed to import a signed PGP message. You are supposed to verify it. This is a more sophisticated step than encryption/decryption, so leave it until you 100% understand encryption/decryption.<br />4. You cannot copy a signature off a signed message. The signature is part of the signed message. It goes with it at all times, the slightest change to the message will cause the signature to become void.<br /><br />Basically you need to go to Basic on this, otherwise you&#039;ll be in a world of confusion. I suggest you google PGP introduction, I think understanding some of the theory of public key cryptography will help you.<br /><br />http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/<br /><br />
