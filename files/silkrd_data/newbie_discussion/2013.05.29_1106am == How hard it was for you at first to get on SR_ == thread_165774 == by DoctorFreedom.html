				Im a complete noob so i wouldn&#039;t say finding SR was easy. I stumbled across it while doing research on a completely unrelated topic which i was immersing myself in at the time. So i can honestly say i&#039;ve only just found out about it. Downloading TOR and finding the SR URL was a piece of piss. Took me 2 days to get BCs into my SR account. One thing i think i would recommend is to move small volumes of Bitcoins through the correct channels initially till you know what your doing. I didn&#039;t, and found the stress of waiting for the BCs to arrive into the various accounts and wallets a little bit fucked. Move an amount your prepared to lose first time and it would be a fair bit more fun. Now its no problem. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what is the coolest thing that ive just discovered. The drugs available, or the Bitcoin market. Both amazing and unknown to me until now.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				i probably spent a few hours at it. mainly because everything was new to me. i had no idea what tor was, bitcoins, wallets, gpg, etc... and i knew very little about internet anonymity and security. every time i learned about something it opened a new door of shit i had to learn. actually it still seems like that most days lol&nbsp; <br />pretty lucky that by the time i got into this there was already idiot proof user friendly software out there. the tor browser bundle and gpg4usb was pretty much just download and use. if i had to config a bunch of settings and figure out everything on my own i would probably still be going at it. <br />unfortunately i found the SR url easy but didnt realize there was a forum till months later when SR went down and the page provided a forum link with updates lol&nbsp; :o

				I&#039;m still in the process of taking baby steps. I&#039;ve got the bit coins down and all but the PGP is kind of a complete mystery to me. I plan on getting it down once I&#039;m ready to make my first purchase though. I have gpg4win.

				I found it all a bit of a challenge, so I took it in small steps.&nbsp; Downloading Tor and browsing SR was relatively easy.&nbsp; Understanding PGP was a little harder and I took a few hours researching it and learning how to encrypt messages.&nbsp; Understanding bitcoins and how to get them was even harder and took up several hours... actually I&#039;m still not sure I understand them exactly, but I have a wallet and it has bitcoins in it, so I did something right.&nbsp; All of this was spread out over a few months of lurking in the forum and learning as much as I could.<br /><br />Until embarking on the SR journey, I thought I was reasonably tech savvy, but now I feel like an old person trying to understand &quot;the google.&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s actually been pretty fun though and has taught me much about internet privacy and security in general.&nbsp; ;D

				Ach, it&#039;s not so hard...and I say this confidently as someone who hasn&#039;t done it yet&nbsp; ;)<br />Nah but I&#039;ve figured out the PGP, and pretty much sussed how to do the Bitcoin (I think), just got to go put some actual money in my actual bank account and get the ball rolling.<br />Ask me again in a couple of days&nbsp; ;)

				Downloading and installing TOR and accessing the login page for SR was easy.&nbsp; The hard part was getting the courage to create that account, learning BTC, acquiring BTC, and then learning PGP.&nbsp; Also learning the general etiquette was a step too.&nbsp; It would have been much easier if I had someone at my side teaching me in person but I managed to do it all on my own, by following all of the user help guides that I found.<br /><br />You can teach an old dog new tricks, especially when it comes to drugs&nbsp; 8)

				pretty easy tbh, downloaded orbot android app at first, later got tor on lap top. hardest thing all together was probably bitcoins, buying uk bank transfer, although this only took about 30 mins to find, purchase and transfer. cant believe i&#039;ve not done this sooner....all those wasted years smoking sub standard street shit weed.... feels like coming home!

We had &quot;test markets&quot; that got free high speed internet, for the test period, but that there would be downtimes, and even surveillance from time to time, so our techs could observe first hand what the customer is experiencing. This involved video recording + keylogging customers accounts for hours at a time. <br /><br />They agreed to it just to be a part of the &quot;new FIOS&quot;. - Hey it was free high speed Internet+TV for almost the whole summer! Who wouldn&#039;t overlook some normal &quot;observing&quot;. <br /><br />Well you&#039;d be surprised at the sites we saw people going on, knowing (we presumed) that they could be and were being watched?<br /><br />Of course we were instructed to keep everything to ourselves, and there were security clearances, but if the SR had been around then? We would be able to see you go to your PGP key, copy and paste it, send it etc. - As well as watch you decrypt a message. <br /><br />So my point is, if they want to watch you, they can always go to the central office of your ISP and &quot;observe&quot; or simply put a DVR on it, and download any activity recorded. <br /><br />You&#039;re mileage may vary!<br /><br />-SoAlone<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Hey mate,<br />that kind of surveillance can only be done if you have malware/trojan installed on your computer.<br />The ISP can intercept all your traffic of course, but if it&#039;s encrypted they will just see &quot;fsdjkfdsjklfdskjfdkjsfkjds&quot;<br />And TOR and all https sites offer encryption between you and them.<br /><br />Just adding that so new people won&#039;t freak out :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Thanks, I wasn&#039;t aware of that. I remember seeing banking sites and all https sites clear as well, but who knows? I was an Equipment Installer, not on IT guy. <br /><br />Though according to recent revelations about the current US Govt administration, anything and everything is being recorded. You may know more about it being outside the US. The Obama administration is trying their hardest to get each scandal off the front page, but as soon as they do, another one pops up! - We&#039;ve never had a more corrupt, dishonest, privacy violating administration.<br /><br />The only hope now is that the media who was once their ally, will start to turn on them since the AP illegal wiretapping was done to their reporters. <br /><br />Though that may have been leaked on purpose to scare them into not saying anything. Think how many of those reporters have secrets they wouldn&#039;t want their families to know about? <br /><br />It&#039;s all quite alarming. I do hope what you say is true concerning the encryption working! It&#039;s our only defense against a truly evil cabal gov&#039;t!
