				I were interested in buying weed 50-100g for first time and good price. I looked all over weed offers for few times, from first page till 43rd, many, many times to select best vendors. As I knew I will order soon, started to contact vendor about order, had few questions and so on, none of 3-4 vendors have answered me. I used PGP as well, not for all, but definitely used PGP who asked. Few of them have not read message at all(but they have been online since I sent message) and few have just read it and that is all. What is the problem? I want to make business here, but nothing is going forward, my street distributors are contacting me and asking when I will supply them and I have no answer. I know that not everything can happen superfast, but it have been a time already...<br /><br />Anyway, if some vendor is reading this and can offer me something, PM me up. I will be ordering 50-100g for first time, every next time I will double up till kg or something like that. 2-3kg of weed could be max monthly order. I am ordering to EU.

				Vendors are probably busy with orders.<br />The interface is pretty slow, and you want to make absolutely sure you have the customers info correct and the package is sealed well before you even think about visiting a mailbox. Then you have to compare orders to messages, just in case a customer has a change to the order.<br /><br />PGP is great, but some vendors don&#039;t like having to use it for every communication... I don&#039;t mind myself, but I&#039;m just a small fry, so it&#039;s not a big deal to decrypt a couple messages.<br />PGP your address, and re-ask the question from the folks who&#039;ve already read your note.&nbsp; As long as you don&#039;t put any personal info in the message, there should be no problem.<br />If they give you a hard time for the second message, then they probably aren&#039;t worth buying from.

				Hi mate!<br />&nbsp;It was the same for me, a lot of messages without answer, so I keep trying without been annoying. Most of them answer me in 2 days, and that also tells you who cares about his business.<br /><br />You do not worry, if they don&#039;t want your money some one else will will it, so be patient, and try to order from the best rated vendors, even if they are a little expensive, your first time worth the xtra money.

				I&#039;ll say the same thing as well, try a different vendor. Good vendors will make it their business to check their Silr Road messages at least onece a day. It could be that the info after was either a lot, or complicated, in which case they would take more time to answer, especially if a major vendor, who mite be flat out. Apart from thta, if they dont get back to you withn 3 days at most, then that is a bad sign so move on.

				The thing is that, I have contacted almost every vendor who fits my price and my location. I guess I will make few orders without receiving answer, maybe after first orders they will start talking with me. Maybe it is because I am totally new.
