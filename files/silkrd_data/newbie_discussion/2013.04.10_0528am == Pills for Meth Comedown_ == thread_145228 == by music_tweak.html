				If one had serious trouble falling asleep 24-48 hours after meth binge (2-3 days), what would be the most helpful pill to take to help with sleep, anxiety, and all around tweakyness. Also, I am concerned with taking another substance that would fluctuate my heart rate and blood pressure...so, a pill mainly for sleep, but also doesn&#039;t fuck up my heart or something. Also, any other helpful advice for comedown is appreciated. Thanks!

				Xanax or Valium. Any benzo really. They are actually medically INDICATED for overstimulation and comedown from amphetamines. Probably best to only use it when you really need to come down, seeing as bezos are highly addictive, and withdrawals can include seizures and death. If only used occasionally for coming down they are safe. I&#039;ve never tried them, but I do have a few xanax just in case. Had them forever, and haven&#039;t needed them. But they are there JUST IN CASE. Meth can make you think crazy shit. Sleep cures it. Food brings you back to life. If those become too difficult, benzos can help.

				Awesome. I had been planning on getting Xanax, but wanted to make sure it wouldn&#039;t just fuck my shit up or something. Not cool, benzo. Not cool. Only planning on using it 3 or less times over a week, as needed. I figured I would know when I needed it.

				I had been toking quite a lot for the comedown, but I&#039;ve been having weird heart and breathing problems after meth comedown/weed combo. Which is why I want ze pill. -I&#039;ve been toking 3x daily for two years now and never had any sort of problems with mary jane until I started doing meth. Fuck it.

				I personally find Opiates to be the only type of substance that can produce significantly beneficial &amp; alleviating results when battling a Meth comedown. I&#039;ve been a Meth addict for the past eight years, though, so clearly our situations are vastly different from one another. Nevertheless, painkillers would still be a mighty effective solution to the shitty-ness of coming down from Meth. <br /><br />That said, though, I&#039;m actually most inclined to recommend Benzos to help the occassional &amp;/or new Meth user with the awful comedown experience.

				^<br />lol<br /><br />I just added some Xanax and coke to my incoming meth order. I don&#039;t want to combine either with meth at the same time, seems like a waste, but if I don&#039;t have anything else I&#039;ll snort it until the gram is gone. I&#039;m still trying to figure out how to take care of my nose when binging for 3-4 days.. I&#039;ve smoked/IV/oral/snorted, and snorting is by far my favorite. I just don&#039;t want to fuck up my nose.
