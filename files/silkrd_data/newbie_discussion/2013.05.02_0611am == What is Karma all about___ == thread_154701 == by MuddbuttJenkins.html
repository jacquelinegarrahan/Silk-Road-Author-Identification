				Karma is just a measure of feedback for your forum posts. Members, I believe, with over 100 posts can give positive or negative karma. Doesn&#039;t really mean much, just gives you an indication about the quality of your posts. It&#039;s a pretty common feature of BBSs.

				Karma in Indian religions is the concept of &quot;action&quot; or &quot;deed&quot;, understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called saṃsāra) originating in ancient India and treated in the Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, and Sikh religions.

				I do love the function it serves here on SR as it can provide info as to how knowlegdable a member you are and how positive or thoughtful or funny your posts can be. Or quite the opposite as if you&#039;re trolling or just post ridiculous things to get a rise out of people. Looking forward to the point where I cant start giving out my own positive and negative points.

				Karma, Reputation, up and down votes, any number of variants on this exist and it&#039;s pretty common these days. The idea is if you like a post you click &quot;thank&quot; (or some equivalent). If you don&#039;t like a post you click &quot;discourage.&quot; The idea being that humans, who thrive on attention and acceptance, will always attempt to make posts which increase, rather than decrease, Karma, resulting in better posting.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a huge fan of this system. Everywhere I&#039;ve seen a similar system implemented it tends to reduce rather than increase the quality of posts. Good comments get downvoted because people to lazy to look up the facts or argue with the poster downvote quality (if counter-intuitive) posts. Users are generally discouraged from having original thoughts and it tends to become a giant circle jerk of weird political correctness. It&#039;s not so bad here, but check out yahoo answers, reddit, youtube and other like sites that have completely destroyed any intelligent culture they might have because people are just trying to accumulate crowd-pleasing but vacuous posts instead of having honest and open communication.

They keep going through the Newbie section threads and other threads and give everyone a neg. Regardless of how much you try and F1 here, they will neg you as you have posted on a thread they are targeting. If you are negged for no reason, check out the ones above and below you on the same page. And then there are those that sit here and neg people every 72 hours without reason, without even contributing to The Road. Sorry to all those newbies who have been negged before being plussed. They cheapen this [edit.] can&#039;t say &#039;community&#039; b/c it isn&#039;t, but whatever this is, it cheapens it. Here&#039;s a +1 for this page. Not all of us are haters.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
