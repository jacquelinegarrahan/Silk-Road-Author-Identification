				Hey guys just wanted to leave a product review about a recent transaction of mine.&nbsp; I know this is the newbie section of the forum but I still have yet to reach 50 posts.&nbsp; Anyways, been a member since around 2010 and have had the usual good, bad, great and awe full experiances you inevitably come across on SR.&nbsp; Most recent purchase was a G of H from Psilocin (gotta love the VIP listings for returning customers) with expidited shipping as I live in the NE USA.&nbsp; First of all I fucked up my main feedback for the listing so that why I&#039;m posting this; accidentally hit 4 out of 5 rating and am doing everything I can to correct this mistake (contacting SR admin staff about the issue and other possible solutions) knowing full well that anything below a 5 hurts and the service I got deserves a 10.&nbsp; Any way, out of all my orders on SR, this venders stealth is by far the best, most creative and cutting edge as any I have read about or recieved(basically if it doesn&#039;t make it to you, someone narc&#039;ed).&nbsp; Shipping time was just as described, product weight was generous and quality was right for the price.&nbsp; On a side note this vender has always been a pleasure to deal with an facilitates to your needs, didn&#039;t even really get upset about the rating mistake I made, I just feel really bad because what a stand up vender he is.
