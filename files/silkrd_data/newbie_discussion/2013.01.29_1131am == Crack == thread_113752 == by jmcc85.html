				Does Mathews ship to the states? Why not just drop a gram of coke in a glass of amonia and wait a few seconds then pour it into a coffee filter? Works every time

				cheers guy i will check these out.&nbsp; Cant wait to smoke some real coke instead of the plastic they sell here in the uk.&nbsp; I liked the look of c93 amg and street dealers stuff although a little pricey they should be quality product for that price. <br /><br />In regards to the amonia in a glass, i have never tryed this as the cocaine we get here is so poor it would be a waste of time
