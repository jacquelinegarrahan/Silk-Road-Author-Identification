				Hey...<br /><br />So working at this whole 50 posts thing.. pissed I lost the pass for first forum account, and is especially stoopid considering the subject of my first post with this new account.. but you know... we roll with the punches&nbsp; and get on with the business of being civil in our disobedience..... So here I am... about to be so sane your mind will blow!!!!... <br /><br />I read a fe times in different topics people asking about or commenting on different cleaning methods for their glassware and was duty bound to advise those who are ready about the master level cleaning methods I have developed over the 16+ years of coping with being a Virgo and suffering the smelly and dirty utensils my hobbies require.. So much mess!!! Must fix now... lol but seriously I have been trying everything I could think of over the years.. Some ideas worked OK, like the toothpaste and gumption did, but either scratchpad away the surface over time, again like with toothpaste and gumption as they both are abrasive, or just rated too high on the pain in the ass rankings and usually ended with doing more damage than good... then one day the cleaning gods showed me great favor and I was given a bite from the fruit of the tree of knowledge.. and it was a good day!!<br /><br />Bongs? Ok so you will need the following items;<br /><br />your bong (dirty and gutter hash blocked as much as possible!)<br />A supply of hot water, the hotter the better but be careful of scalding yourself and also of the gutter hash staining... Porcelain in the bathroom WILL stain but the stainless steel one in the laundry won&#039;t..<br />Laundry powder.... Omo seems good but really anything with &#039;active enzymes&#039; or whatever will work a treat too<br /><br />So its a simple process ....<br /><br />First rinse the bong in the hottest water you can manage with and keep rinsing until it has removed the flaky sludge and you are left with just the &#039;bath ring&#039; style stuff that is left behind. A trick is to have the hot water flowing straight down the stem so you don&#039;t have to burn your fingers with the hot water. When done right you should get enough pressure to force the water to flow out the carb (shotty, bung etc) leaving the top cooler to tip the bulk water out between rinses. Next take a scoop of the laundry powder and drop into the bong coating the walls as much as possible. The bong should not have water in at this stage just the damp sludge left behind and the powder coating you just applied.. hear that?listen close and you can hear the fizzle of hassle free cleaning.. leave for a few seconds or more and genly fill the bong with HOT water... the hotter the better and if done right you will get all the sludge first time .I usually fill till just below the mouth piece stem and swirl the water a little bit to get it all rolling along. <br /><br />Take 5... the longer you leave itto bubble away&nbsp; the better and the odd swirl or 2 every few mins will speed it along too.. you will be watching the crap on the walls inside go a lighter brown and float away from the pyrex/glass... its kinda awesome.. but anyway ..... so when your happy to just&nbsp; rinse with , you guessed it, hot water and you will be looking at your bong shining like its brand new again! I run some warm water as a last thing and run my hands over it all to rub away the slippery film that gets left behind and. the &#039;shadow&#039; the carb (shotty, whatever you call the hole in the mouth piece stem) leaves is either a ruler and bit of wash cloth or whatever or you can block the hole and fill with water above the shadow and the process will be as effective in removing it too.<br /><br />&quot;Oh goodness... dude was for real!! but Why is it so?&#039; you will wonder as you look at the stem and cone piece&nbsp; and it hits you why a glass setup for these items may be a winner of an idea.... I&#039;ll tell you the hot tip too... you can (and should as soon a s possible) buy replacement ones that go right into your current &quot;Bonza&quot; stem water pipe or whatever size stem/cone you have and are cheap and super easy to set up..... Best $10 I ever spent on a bong upgrade/add-on and real or not I feel healthier and clearer than&nbsp; I did in the days of the aluminum and/or brass in items I had for so many years...<br /><br />CLEAR-NET ahead --&gt;http://www.ozbongs.com.au/10cm-Glass-Bonza-Kit-1871/<br /><br />On the why powder used for washing clothes is so effective on bong sludge....Well its these &#039;active enzymes&#039; that are doing the leg work for you and the hot water activates them setting them free on the sludge. They are really good at breaking down oily, dirty organic stuff from your cloths in its day job so its just more of the same for in <br /><br />As always its a mater of getting the process down and using the right powder but I for example now have a cheap costing generic brand powder i buy for this task and it works out a ass load cheaper than any other cleaning product I could find and there is NOTHING so sweet as the first pipe from a *Pure* clean billy so this was very worth the effort.... oh 2 other things; rinse with clean water to make sure there isn&#039;t any soapy taste to it and once wet and soapy the stem will be very easy to move around so play around with the idea of jumping on the whole glass stem and cone, or bowl they are referred to on the dark side, thingy.. its a better life in so many ways and you will wonder what on earth made you think it was OK to smoke from Aluminum and brass for so long... just use a plastic container and put powder inside stem and place them in the container filled with the hot water... same result and it honestly feels like a new rig just purchased and makes the smoke taste cleaner and more honest.. not always smoother mind you but closer to its natural taste.<br /><br /><br />The meth pipe is its own unique beast and takes a polar opposite approach in many ways but the solution is so simple and produces such unimaginable results.... its truly a thing of beauty...I clean the leftover whatever it happens to be between each charge and can keep the frosting building in the stem and on the side of the bowl (this stuff&nbsp; is my emergency fallback when times are leaner so is white gold to me)..<br /><br />&quot;So FFS just spit it out&quot; I can hear the meth lovers out there screaming... I know its been a ride to get to here&nbsp; but I promise you one thing.... if you try this method your pipe will be the cleanest you have ever seen it and will be so close to a new pipe every time you will be glad you made it...<br /><br />Magic Block Eraser.....&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This stuff&nbsp; ----&gt; CLEAR-NET ahead --&gt; http://www.jmldirect.com/uk/doktor-power/doktor-power-magic-eraser/invt/d03me30100000001/&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />OR<br /><br />This stuff&nbsp; ----&gt; CLEAR-NET ahead --&gt; http://www.chux.com.au/the-chux-range/chux-magic-eraser-range/index.html<br /><br /><br />I use a small piece torn off the big block with a drop or 2 of water sprinkled on till its damp and then just I use it in a cupped hand to polish the outside clean, just straight at it and this stuff will just own anything short of actual damage to the glass.. tweezers and a little bit more to do inside the bowl and once all the nasty is gone and you want to finish off with a drying and polishing inside and out then a bit of paper towel or a cloth like those you get to clean your sunglasses will do the job. This foam block they call magic eraser, this shit will just peel away any burned on, baked in or spilled through crap on the glass.. the black shit from the unskilled smoker will just disappear on to the foam&nbsp; and if one is more stubborn all that&#039;s needed is a little extra water and foam to ensure the total and absolute decimation of any unwanted stains that insist that they must persist ... its the end of the line for them now though and the glass cleaned this way will be gleaming like new and undamaged from the process..and you a happy little pipe head. :-) A word from the wise&nbsp; about using water and not your saliva to moisten the foam to start. Use water.... DO NOT lick or dab the foam on your tongue... if you do let it touch your tongue for even a second the solvent that&#039;s impregnated into it that combines with the microfiber of the foam will burn and leave a ulcer... I admit nothing here and have only one thing to say on this tip... Mouthwash will help with mouth/tongue ulcers and will speed up the healing of them... <br /><br /><br />Next episode we look at building a 50 post count quick and&nbsp; the do&#039;s and don&#039;ts to on writing novels as replies or posts on forum boards but that&#039;s another topic for another time so until then...<br />Later.

				tldr; However, if you did not address it, Oxyclean works great for cleaning cannabis pipes than can be submerged in hot water. I usually fill the pipe with as much oxy clean powder I can get into it. Then heat some water up, doesn&#039;t have to be boiling, and pour it in a glass container with the pipe filled with oxy clean in it, and wait a bit. This method tends to stink a bit so I life to do it on the stove and just run the stove vent-a-hood to minimize the smell.
