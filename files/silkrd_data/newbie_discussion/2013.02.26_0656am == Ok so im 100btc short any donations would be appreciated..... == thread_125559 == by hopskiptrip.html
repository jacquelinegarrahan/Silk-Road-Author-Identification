				Ha Just kidding or am I... Welcome to the first ever Raise bitcoins for drugs post to 50 marathon. Today I am trying to raise awareness of my need for 50 post and the very empty wallet of those precious bitcoins. I have a drive and a want for drugs with a drive to visit bat country in all its glory and the need/ want to share it with the regular community after I get 50 posts. So if you fine men and women would like to end the years of repression of this crazy old vet with a donation of 100 50 or even 25 it will go to good use by a user like me. Just remember I can only keep the habit going with the support of user like you. Also for a limited time you kind people who donate 100btc will get a lovely picture of my shriveled nuts and maybe a blown up picture of my dick on coke. For 50btc you will be gifted a picture of me in walmart wearing nothing but shoes and a g string. And you who donate 25 or less you will get a limited addition close up of my pucker hole. <br />All donation can be sent to 1KAKwRmFSXNvgzEPg82w8ZsCr8MqoKtLfB Just remember to act fast you do not want to be left out or scammed by somebody else. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />These gifts are only in limited supplies of none so hurry to donate fast before I run out. Okay I am done but hey one post closer.
