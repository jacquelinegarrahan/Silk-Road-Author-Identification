				5 days in transit usually takes 3 days from anywhere domestic. I normally would not be worried but looking at his feed back now it seems way over the top positive and he has no listings up. It seems like a scammer.

				5 days is way too soon to be saying you didn&#039;t get your order. Especially with a weekend in the middle of it. Saying you didn&#039;t get it &quot;yet&quot; would be more accurate. And vendors take down their listings all the time, for any number of reasons. That means nothing and certainly is no reason to be crying scammer. QualityKings is legit. His wax was some of the best that I&#039;ve tried on SR.

				Time will tell. And it&#039;s early yet, alhthough you can alwasy figure a more straightforward way for shit to get to you. No insult, but it&#039;s better to ame accusations later, way later. <br />Good luck in any case and best practice it to give the benefit of the doubt for

				A lot of people are in the same boat with him. My first order was some of the best wax id ever had. This order has been in transit for a week and he hasnt logged on for 2 days. Kinda sketchy if you ask me

				Hello Everyone,<br /><br />We apologize for any issues in the past, We became a victim of our own success and simply could not keep up with orders without jeopardizing quality and our stealth shipping methods. We took our listings down and restructured our business to make sure this sort of thing does not ever happen again. We understand this sort of thing is not acceptable and we are truly sorry for any troubles we have caused you in the past. We assure you that we are not scammers, We are pretty certain that most everyone got refunded thru the resolution center. We now have the capability to handle a volume that is far beyond anyone&#039;s imagination. We are shipping almost all of our packages out same day as of right now and plan on keeping it this way. We have also added some new products on our listings page. If you had any issues with us in the past please send us a message and let us know what we can do to earn your business again. We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />-qk
