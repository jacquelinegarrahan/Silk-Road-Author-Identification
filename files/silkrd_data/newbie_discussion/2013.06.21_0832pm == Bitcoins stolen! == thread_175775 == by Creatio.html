				Well well well, it appears that just around a bitcoin and a half was stolen from my silk road account, somehow.<br /><br />Of course, i am upset about it. Is there any possible way to retrieve them?<br /><br />

				nope, they&#039;re gone. sorry. you can look up your SR bitcoin wallet address on the blockchain to try to see the wallet address it was sent to, but that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />are you sure you didnt take too many xanax and order something without remembering, or something? (i&#039;ve done that)<br /><br />change your password asap and/or get a new buying acct.<br /><br />sorry dude. i&#039;d avoid keeping any coin in your SR wallet; move it from your offsite wallet into SR only when you&#039;re ready to buy.

				I think if your account is based on dollar, your bitcoin will fluctuate according to the exchange rate.<br />But 1.50 BTC is quite a lot to disappear because of fluctuation (if that happened recently).

				Did you log in to any other site than&nbsp; silkroadvb5piz3r.onion? Were you asked for you PIN on the login page? If so, you&#039;ve been phished. You should changed you PIN and password immediately for good measure.<br /><br />If not, maybe you got to a dodgy page, like the links some scammers mass mail to people and got a keylogger on your system. Maybe you also had a weak-ass PIN and password (i.e. 123456) but even if you did, it&#039;s highly unlikely that someone got your funds that way. Look at your account history like others suggested here and see if a withdrawal happened recently. <br /><br />You should contact SR support and explain them your situation.
