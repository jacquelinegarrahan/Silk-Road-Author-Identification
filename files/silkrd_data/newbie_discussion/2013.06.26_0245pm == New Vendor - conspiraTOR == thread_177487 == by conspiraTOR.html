				Hi<br /><br />I&#039;m a new domestic Australian vendor on SR and thought I&#039;d say hello on the forum. My vendor page can be found here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f1f67fe788<br /><br />At the moment, I don&#039;t have much more to say other than what&#039;s already been said in my vendor page. I would like to offer 10 forum members with over 50 posts, 15 successful transactions and over $1000 spent a free 200mg sample of the MDMA that I will be selling. Please message my SR account to recieve the link. I&#039;d appreciate if you could post a review of my service and product after recieving it.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m having an Opening Sale for the time being so all my normal listings will be at a reduced price. <br /><br />conspiraTOR

				message sent. review if sample arrives.<br /><br />[EDIT1] Package has arrived today, indicating to me that the envelope has entered the mail stream at the same time &quot;in transit&quot; has been selected.<br />The quality of the packaging is fantastic, one of the best I have ever received international or domestic! Both addresses have been printed, with the return address appearing to be completely legitimate and real. Before opening I had a fairly decent feel for any identifiable lumps to reveal the contents and nothing resembling powder/crystals/drugs could be identified. Inside the express parcel and secured in place was a sealed Mylar sachet with an appropriate decoy message. Inside was twice more vacuum sealed with finally the product inside a resealable bag. <br /><br />Product appearance is exactly as the listing portrays. A translucent tan colour with a mixture of small crystals, large crystals, some crushed into powder and a slightly moist oil (sass) binding it all together. Smell is classic aniseed, slightly licorice, slightly chemical, smell expected of quality European quality MDMA. This bag was sold as 200mg, and ended up weighing out of the bag over 240mg!!!<br /><br />I found communications polite, too the point, and comparatively fast.<br /><br />Sampling of this batch of MDMA will most likely occur on the weekend with another edit to follow.<br />[EDIT2] Sampling has taken place. with 140mg bombed and 100mg snorted in 4 lines at the same time. My first impressions are WOW! the burn is eye watering, and the drip is strong tasting just the way it should. effects from snorting came on within 5 minutes putting me in a very warm fuzzy place, with the bomb kicking in about 15 minutes later on an empty gut. In my experience this product is close to 84% pure as can be expected, and is providing pleasant waves of euphoria with enhanced appreciation of lights, sounds and colours. Warm and fuzzy, just the way I like my MDMA!<br /><br />I feel this vendor has achieved full 5/5 marks across the board. A valuable addition to domestic silk road scene. <br /><br />Stay safe!<br />

				This vendor has great potential. I received an opening sample and the transaction was 5/5 in all aspects<br /><br />Communication - Very fast and helpful<br />Shipping - Next day delivery and fast processing<br />Stealth - Excellently hidden and well innovated packaging<br />Product - Portrayed accurately and is of great quality (received some really convincing feedback from other mates who also tested).<br /><br />Definitely coming back for more, thanks!

				Hi SR<br /><br />Thanks for all the support! A recent expereince has led me to want to clarify one thing. I describe my products as best as I can however I can not accurately tell you what dose xxxmg will do for you. Buyers&#039; anonimity would be violated if I knew personal details that would allow me to even guess about that sort of thing.&nbsp; Therefore I cannot accept any orders that are made on the condition such as guarenteeing that a certain amount will make you &quot;roll hard&quot; etc. It&#039;s just untrustful and bad business.<br /><br />Kind Regards<br />conspiraTOR

				Hey guys.<br />I&#039;ve received my sample and I&#039;ll be posting my review below:<br /><br />To begin, the shipping time was quick and the packaging and stealth was sufficient. If I remember correctly, it was vac sealed.<br />The bag was overweight. Since I had bought some capsules a few weeks prior, I decided I&#039;d cap the MDMA. I made up 2x 210ish mg capsules. <br /><br />I had an opportunity a few nights ago to roll, so I invited 4 or 5 friends over and we hung out. I took the caps roughly an hour apart. <br /><br />As usual, the come up had me in some strife. The MDMA come up ALWAYS makes me feel horrible. I get really anxious and I just don&#039;t feel right. I sat around for a while, waiting for the effects and voila, I&#039;m hit with intense euphoria. I felt incredible. The weird thing about this roll was that I simply didn&#039;t feel like talking much. All I could do was sit in silence thinking about how insanely euphoric I was feeling. This went on for 2-3 hours. The come down eventually hit and I became rather tired and unmotivated. From then on in, I smoked weed and became even more tired and unmotivated. It was a nice subtle come down.<br /><br />Communication: 5/5<br />Delivery time: 5/5<br />Product: 5/5<br />Stealth: 55<br /><br />Overall: 5/5<br /><br />I had a great night, cheers mate!<br />-AussiePP

				Hi SR<br /><br />Unfortunately I have decided to put my prices up for the time being. The reason is that I simply cannot keep up with demand for $160 domestic MDMA. At the rate I was going I&#039;d be selling out very quickly. This usually wouldn&#039;t be a problem though in my case about 70% of my funds are stuck in escrow, some far longer than they should have been. I will hopefully return to a lesser price soon once I am able to buy new stock but for now I&#039;m going to slow things down a little.<br /><br />Thanks SR for all your support.<br /><br />conspiraTOR
