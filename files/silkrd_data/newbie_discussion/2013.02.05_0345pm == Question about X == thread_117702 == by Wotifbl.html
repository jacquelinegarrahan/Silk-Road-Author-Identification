				I have very little experience with X, but I have enjoyed it the few times I have tried it.<br />I am only familiar with it in pill form, but I see a lot of listings for MDMA in powder/crystal form.<br /><br />If I decide to go with this option, is there a good reference on line to walk me through dosage, prep, etc.<br /><br />total noob question I know, but at least it is in the right spot.

				Only had experience with powder myself be interested to know how the rolls compare. There should be plenty of information on dosage in the forums. In fact there is a really useful one which starts with the line &#039;MDMA is neurotoxic.&#039; and I can&#039;t remember the rest just type it in the search bar you&#039;ll find it.<br /><br />Make sure you crush your crystals adequately and then my advice would be to make two rizzla bombs the first containing around 100mg and the second around 60mg. Take the second about an hour after you feel the effects of the first. Works a treat for me. However all this is dependent on numerous factors; your size, tolerance stomach contents etc. Just do some thorough research

				Thanks BA<br />I have been spending some time on the forums, but it is slow going.&nbsp; I guess I need to hit the thread about speeding up TOR first.<br />I will check out the thread you mentioned.

				erowid.org have a huge database on mdma. Dosage, effects, etc..&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I prefer mdma crystal to xtc pills. You never really know what binders and stuff is added to the pills.<br />200mg of mdma crystal is a normal/moderate dose. imo.&nbsp; <br />Just swallow it, or wrap in a rizla first if the taste is too bad. (really bitter).

				its important how much you weight, for a 70-80kg person which has no tolerance 80-110 mg should be comfortable for a great party night ;)<br />Depending on the quuality of MDMA ;)<br /><br />Peace

				I always made 125mg (= 1/8 of a gram - easy to eye ball) capsules. <br />Swallow them down about 3 hours after your last meal,<br />avoid alcohol for a while... <br /><br />If after +/- 2 hours you feel like: &quot;I can handle some more and want some more&quot;, <br />then you can decide to get a second capsule down your stomach - <br />but be shure to wait long enough before redosing... <br /><br />I personally never crush my cristals, I like it that it comes up slow and steady for a long while...<br />except, off course, when I snorted it - but that&#039;s a totally other way to use this product and most people don&#039;t enjoy it because of the burning feeling... <br /><br />Other nice way to use MDMA is to dip your finger into it.<br />In this case I&#039;d start with a good finger (lett&#039;s say 2 or 3 nice cristals) and then you can re-dip every 45min/1 hour or so. This will not get you as high as a capsule, but you&#039;ll be able to build it up slowly and steady for hours and hours and hours...
