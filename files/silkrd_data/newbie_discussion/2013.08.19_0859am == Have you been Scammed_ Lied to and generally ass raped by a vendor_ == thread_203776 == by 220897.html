				Yeah I got fucked over by La fuente. Only got 50% back from support despite it being obvious from the feedback he had gone rogue. Should have been shut down quicker.

				I can&#039;t understand, what for you named it, it&#039;s about 500 seller on SR(i red in inet), and some of them have perfect feedback. It&#039;s you feedback, you comments about good communication, trust vender and etc., and in some cases it&#039;s like that. &quot;Not arrived&quot; item from the vendor with top feedback must be equivalent of 100%<br />reshipping. And reshipping must to be in the obligatory status, as a compromise.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Got scammed by 12saves21, but I think they quit. It was my own fault anyway, it was going to resolution and the small amount I had invested wasn&#039;t worth the hit on my stats.

				If anyone gets scammed by a vendor, and they&#039;re sure it&#039;s a burn, not a mistake, miscommunication or anything else , if it&#039;s definately a rip off, then I&#039;d say name n shame them all day long. They deserve it, but, you gotta be sure.

				i dont see how people can get scammed if they just look at there reputation. if they have more than one bad rep, then just dont risk it. but if they have 99% rep, or whatever it is, then go for it. i just dont see how people get scammed. im not tryin to sound smart or anything because to be completely honest ive never even bought from here yet. maybe ill learn someday :/

I go as far out of my way as I can to make sure my customers get exactly or more than expected. That being said I completely agree with 88. If you KNOW you have been burnt then by all means out the fucker. Not only to vent but to bring knowledge and security to other buyers on the road. BUT you have to be sure! Remember that there is always a chance a package wont make it. It happens to all sorts of packages legit and otherwise.
