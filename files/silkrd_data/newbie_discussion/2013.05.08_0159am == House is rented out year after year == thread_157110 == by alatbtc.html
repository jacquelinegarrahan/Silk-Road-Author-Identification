				I live in a house that I am renting for the year (along with other tenants). We still get mail from the previous tenants that were living here. I was wondering, for that extra layer of security, could I give the correct address, but put the name of previous tenants in the delivery address? Would that work at all?

This may already be happening in this case, and you&#039;re just getting the junk mail in their names.<br />If you&#039;re getting bank statements and official government letters etc. I&#039;d imagine its safe enough to use their name.<br /><br />Keep in mind though that it doesn&#039;t actually add any security - if you&#039;re caught in possession of it, it won&#039;t matter what name it was addressed to whether it&#039;s John Smith or Mickey Mouse. The only benefit is being able to say &quot;It must have been for the previous owner, we still get their mail&quot;; the response to which -by a judge - would probably be &quot;You were found in possession of drug X; therefore I am finding you guilty of possession of a controlled substance&quot;, possibly with an added &quot;with intent for sale and supply&quot; tacked on the end depending on your local laws regarding possession of controlled substances.<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks for the information. I hadn&#039;t thought about the previous tenant re-routing their mail.<br /><br />You sound knowledgeable, so I was wondering if you could give me an answer that other people haven&#039;t been able to sufficiently answer regarding personal usage.<br /><br />I&#039;m about to order from a vendor called &quot;CannabisCrew&quot;. This vendor uses MBBs, and is going to be sending the package domestically. I&#039;m only going to be ordering 1/4th of mj from them, which brings me to my question. <br /><br />I&#039;m assuming that I pretty much can&#039;t be caught if I use the proper address/name unless the package breaks in transit. However, if I AM caught in transit, what will USPS do? I&#039;m assuming,based on prior info, that they will just confiscate the package. However, are there any more severe repercussions that might be possible? E.g. warrant or controlled delivery. I was assuming that there wouldn&#039;t be, based on the fact that they wouldn&#039;t want to waste financial resources on something so small. Further, I&#039;m in an area that has a medical marijuana law. Thanks!

I&#039;m sure somebody more knowledgeable about the USPS and US laws etc. will come along and will be able to help you out though.<br /><br />My OPINION is that your product would simply be seized and destroyed. However, please do not consider that opinion as advice because I honestly have no idea how they view things like this in the US.<br /><br />Libertas

				Ok thanks for the help anyway :).<br /><br />If anybody else could chime in on my question, I&#039;d be extremely grateful. I have my hand hovering over the purchase button but I&#039;m hesitant to do so until I get a solid answer from someone.

				Curious about this too from someone who actually knows something. I imagine if there is a customs seizure your name/address gets added onto a list somewhere and future mail (especially foreign) may get flagged. I doubt they&#039;d invest time investigating a small delivery, but multiple seizures or a large quantity seems likely to bring some unwanted visitors.

				Even though I&#039;m new here, I&#039;ve been shipping for a while outside of SR: I&#039;ve had this happen several times with much larger amounts than a 1/4th and all they do is confiscate and destroy. I even know people who have shipped to the same address after a package has been caught up with out an issue. Not saying that this is definitely going to happen but based on my experience, if the package is seized, they won&#039;t do anything but destroy it. Although I strongly recommend not using that address again in the future if they do seize it.

				I made my first SR purchase using Cannabis Crew, and I got it fine.&nbsp; I have to admit after I submitted my order (after PGPing my address of course) I kept thinking &quot;Oh SHIT! They&#039;re gonna get me!&quot;&nbsp; But I got my package, I used my real name and address, the stealth was better than anything I had ever seen before.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as &quot;what if&quot;, IANAL, but a 1/4 oz isn&#039;t a whole lot in the grand scheme of things. I think the likelihood of getting caught is very remote.&nbsp; Unless someone in your household opens your mail.&nbsp;

				Ultimately you have to use your own discretion. Research each vendor. Reviews on SR are less reliable than reviews from the forums. Reviews from users with less comments and low reputation are not as reliable as those with a high reputation and and high amount of comments. <br /><br />My personal advice is pick a vendor that&#039;s been around a bit longer and that doesn&#039;t require FE at the moment. Try Cannabis Crew once they stop requiring FE.
