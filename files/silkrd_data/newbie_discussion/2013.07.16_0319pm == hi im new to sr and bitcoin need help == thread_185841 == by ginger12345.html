				You can&#039;t buy bitcoins with credit card, its not unheard of, but, its often a scam, and most sellers avoid it for the same reasons! Bank to Bank transfer is the way things go, certainly for the UK.<br /><br />Do you have a UK bank account or are you in southern ireland? If you do I use bitbargain.co.uk, its quick and easy!<br /><br />If not have a look at https://localbitcoins.com/<br /><br />Its worth getting your self a small % of a bit coin and placing a small order on here before rushing into anything on a larger scale :)

				There&#039;s a UK based bitcoin seller in the Money/Digital currency section of SR. I know you&#039;re not recommended to use bitcoin sellers on here, but I used him and did a bank counter cash payment (i.e. anonymously) and had the bitcoins in my SR account in a matter of minutes.<br />Worth checking..

				There certainly are some good folk selling coins on SR, but its far outweighed by the number of scammers. SR itself tells you not to buy coins like this for good reasons.<br /><br />Bitcoins are perfectly legal, there is no reason to by them cloak and dagger. Why take the risk? I like bitbargain.co.uk because is your working with verified people, sending money by pingit and bacs, all of which leave a paper trail should they not give you the coins! <br /><br />

				@sinister&nbsp; so what do you do when your package is intercepted then all the cops have to do is look at your bank accound see where you have been buying your bitcoin and follow the payments through the block chain.straight to silk road. You have obviously thought this through.

				Also make once you get bitcoins make sure you learn how to encrypt your address using pgp. I use localbitcoins to buy my btc, idk if that works in Ireland though
