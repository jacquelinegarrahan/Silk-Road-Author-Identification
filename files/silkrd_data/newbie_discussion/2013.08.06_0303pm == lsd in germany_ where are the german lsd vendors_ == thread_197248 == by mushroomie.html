				because it cost more money.some vendors had offer stronger tabs for an cheaper price and i hope that someone can offer stronger tabs for an ok price in .in the netherlands there are offers like 210mic on a tab for 12 euro or buy 25 and pay 8 euro for one tab.the thing is that when i use lsd i use it in very high doses.i mean under 1200mics its not a great trip in my opinion and with the weak tabs this is very expensive and i must eat so many of these then i buy 4 300mic and have the same effect lke from 10 120 mic^^ and it was cheaper .

				Alright well that makes sense, however I think you&#039;re going to have a very hard time finding a TRUSTED domestic vendor in Germany who sells their product for less than Alaska ($105 for 11 120mic tabs).<br /><br />Dog, you are right. After a week you need to take 130% of the lsd you took last time to get a similar caliber trip, after two weeks the tolerance is completely gone. Consider lsd as a treat, not as something you want to do whenever you get your hands on it :)<br /><br />Best of luck though, make sure to let us know if you succeed!<br />

				no i use lsd just 2-3 times a year but for two years or so i had may first 25 300 mics strip.before i always drop one and got a light feeling.then i got these powerful tabs and was thinking what happend when i drop 5 of them and a hour later best trip i ever had.since then i always drop over 1200 mic to get just a grat feeling and visuals for over 24 hours.<br /><br />yeah this is really hard.this time i tried fartbomer and hope everything arrive safe :D<br />i hate to order from outside germany.

				lsd is one of the most compatible drugs for humans.so what should happen?<br />i can only say try 1200 mics and you know exactly what i want when i use it^^<br />but by the way over 4500 mics had the funny effect thats your brain stop working correctly.<br />i was by a friend watching tv on 4500 mic and suddently i coudnt hear and there are no visual..the only thing you see is that what is there but on every eye you had a complete look at the room...your brain dosent make one picture from both eyes it makes 2 pictures one from each eye wich cause very hard headache.i dont know this was too much.i cant write exactly what happens but the sentence your brain stop working is right.<br /><br />when the 210 mics tabs from fartbomber arrive for the weekend i drop 6 or 8 at one on a festival like last year from the 300 mics ^^

				I suppose you&#039;re right. I thought 25i wouldn&#039;t be as bad because the typical blotter has 1000ug on it, whereas lsd typicially has 100-200ug. <br /><br />And no, I haven&#039;t. All my trips have been around 200ug. Why do you ask?

				it was real acid ^^ <br />for my 4500 mic trip i ate 15 300mics blotters and thats was to heavy.25i blotter can end up deadly when you drop over 1500 mics so im really sure it was acid and it came from top vendors on the road . nothing cause such a nice trip like lsd maybe dmt but i miss the bodyfeeling there.and dmt only make fun when you combinied it wqith maos^^<br /><br />the trip from 25i is really lame ...its like when you eat a few shrooms so 0,5 g on 2 xtc pills.i dont know this is not what i want ^^&nbsp; &nbsp;lsd is the best^^ <br /><br /><br />

				the other dates where from an uni in germany for chemistry.<br />the test the lethal doses on animals like mouse to elephants apes and so on and the 3 g are the reckoned <br />lethal dose for humans but not proven.but many sites with the chemistry from lsd have the same ls50 doses for animal so i think 3g is possible.i mean a mouse died on 46 000 mics... so i think on such a dose you will not die but end up as a crazy pice shit and eating your own poo...<br />i think on a dose of 12 000 mics you loose the control over your brain and you end up in a psychiatry for sure.
