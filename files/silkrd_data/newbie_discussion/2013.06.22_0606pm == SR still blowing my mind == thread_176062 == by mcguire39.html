				It hasn&#039;t quite fully sunken in yet. I saw SR about two weeks ago and have had a couple good orders since. I still just can&#039;t believe that some of the finest cannabis in the world is available right here at our fingertips, delivered right to your door. I mean how could someone even dream that such a thing could possibly exist. Yet here it is, in reality, almost larger than life.<br /><br />Thanks SR for providing the platform to make it possible. And thank you vendors for working tirelessly to bring us these world class products at reasonable prices. Long live SR!

				I understand what you mean. first time i saw SR i was chocked. It is pretty amazing how this site works and the whole system around it. After you see this site you never want to go to the streets and buy shitty Quality things, here you find the top Quality of everything.

				You currently have our prince of pot doing 5 years in a southern prison.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not to say that the prince wasn&#039;t in over his head(and is a bit scummy), but it is too much risk these days when you have a border thats no longer safe and southern agents coming and fighting a war in your back yard.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to deal with any country that may have the ability to extradite us.&nbsp; Though we are keeping a eye on the changing political climate and hoping for the best.

				Ah thanks for the details, I wasn&#039;t aware of that. Sorry we&#039;re causing that problem for you. I suspect it isn&#039;t going to get any better. I&#039;ll just have to get a Canadian address haha. I thought NAFTA was supposed to allow free trade between our countries.&nbsp; :D

				I remember reading about Bitcoins a year ago and thinking &quot;hm thats a good idea. But i don&#039;t know why.&quot; SR is why. SR is like a crude beginning to a completely new internet. Like web 3.0 revolution. Don&#039;t think its anything less than a completely disruptive new piece of tech ready to change the world.

It was a rush the very first time. After going thru the process a few times since, it is still fresh each time, even if to a somewhat lesser extent. Mostly I just try to maintain consistency and make sure shit ain&#039;t obvious on my end. <br /><br />As far as my thoughts on The Road Itself: History clearly shows -- supply &amp; demand are ever intertwined.

				It&#039;s how the recreational drugs trade should be- no local monopolies based on violence, just sellers with a product, and a way for buyers to inform others of their experience, meaning that scam sellers or people with bad product never get far. <br />
