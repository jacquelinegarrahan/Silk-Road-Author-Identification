				I too am waiting for a reship from the last bad batch, i ordered it 4 weeks ago and got it 9 days later. And it seems like everyone who ordered after me havent gotten it yet.<br /><br /><br />What&nbsp; i think/hope happend is that LD realised that he got a bad product, and now he needs some fresh lsd before he can send anything out.<br /><br /><br />The reason i dont think he is scamming is that he can make so much more staying in business, off cause if he cant get his hands on more product then he can cash out what he has got in ordres right now, but why kill the goose that lays the golden eggs ? It must be&nbsp; an insane amount of money he is making as the SR top vender, and that is on selling just one product. <br /><br />I think EnterTheMatrix scammed out like he did, is because he was beginning to see the end of his business, law enforcement, no surplies what ever, not because he saw an opportuity to steal a tenth of what he makes i a year, or then again maybe he was just stupid and an asshole..<br /><br />

				That&#039;s why you shouldn&#039;t FE. No matter who the seller is. Anytime he could just quit and scam hundreds of people.

				has anyone mentioned if he should change his return address?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if he uses the same return address but if it goes to the same place every time the address is wrong the people will probably be like &quot;WHY ARE WE GETTING ALL THIS LSD&quot; and maybe have the canadian&nbsp; DEA on that shit stopping anyone who sends from that return address.&nbsp; just a thought, not sure if it&#039;s been mentioned.

				Definently a set up scam the entire time Lucydrop has been a vendor i bet this was planned. 60k in 3 weeks straight up profit no cost at LucyDrop, plus the ten to hundred of thousand of dollar made while legit. All he has to do is wait a few weeks/Months when people have forgotton/more noobs join that haven&#039;t heard of past scammers and do the whole process over again, its almost genius in a anonymous market. Apparently (Tony66 I beleive?) did a similar scheme in the past. So glad i did my research and went with Tessellated, I don&#039;t do small business fuck FE

				yeah fe only meen no no on my end. i havent done an fe yet and never plann too. i feel the escrow system is just about flawless...only flaw being...can you prove you sent a product, or a parcel of mail atleast...if the product is being shiped via snail mail...what happens in resolve? i havent had togo this route myself so i wonder. i personally only use express shipping.( but i guess if they printd out the labels and drop em off at drop box, they dont even get dcn numbers...)when item is shipped properly i believe it protects BOTH of us.<br />

				i had to resovle on a smaller order once. well actually didnt have to. but thought it was a good idea.<br />SR will send u message when u get close to auto-finalize reminding u to put it in res.<br />at that point you now have the option to extend the amount of time or offer another option.<br />theres also a due date(never got there cause i received my gear) but i think when u<br />get to the due date SR demands a res from buyer and seller,and they must come to some agreement.<br />hope that helps
