				There are several threads about this vendor being a scammer -- that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to do some research before you choose a vendor!<br /><br />Did you at least stay in escrow??&nbsp;

				They took mah jerwb.. err moneyyy<br />Mate it happens to the best of us. I have a mate who got scammed to the tune of 5k. Not much you can do when they cut and run. Take it as a very valuable (and expensive lesson). <br /><br />

				This is why we emphasize the importance of DOING YOUR RESEARCH before using a vendor.&nbsp; It&#039;s also why we say OVER AND OVER AGAIN NEVER TO FINALIZE EARLY!<br /><br />There is nothing anyone can do to help you when you make the decision to go outside of the escrow system to finalize early.

There are plenty of vendors who don&#039;t require you to FE, but sadly more and more make. Even if they don&#039;t, they probably will for new buyers, which makes it harder to get a couple good purchases under your belt.

				If all you need is to get some transactions under your belt so you don&#039;t have to FE and you can&#039;t find a vendor offering the same product WITHOUT requiring people to FE, then you can get some transactions by doing some really cheap transactions on SR with the cheap lottery purchases, or there&#039;s a vendor selling virtual hugs, or advice, or fortune cookie things.&nbsp;
