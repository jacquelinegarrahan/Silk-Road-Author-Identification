				I seller is requiring an early FE for free shipping (i know this is bad but he is a very trusted seller and i have only read good things from prior FEs)<br /><br />There is no finalize button on my orders and it says processing?

				You will not be able to finalize until the seller marks the pack &#039;in transit&#039;. Much love.

				And when you have FE&#039;d, be sure to come back later and update your feedback once the package has arrived! There&#039;s nothing worse than seeing a sea of feedback on a vendor&#039;s profile that just says &quot;FE&quot;, &quot;FE, &quot;FE&quot;<br /><br />Good luck.

				Send him a PM telling him that you will FE when he marks the item as &quot;in transit&quot;.<br /><br />That&#039;s what you should do if you are sure you want to FE.<br /><br />What you should *really* do is cancel the transaction and find a seller who doesn&#039;t require you to FE. Of course, that&#039;s easy for me to say - I&#039;ve been here for years.

				Thats weird man, you cant release the funds if the order is still processing. Have you tried to just have this convo with the seller?<br /><br />Ask him how he purposes you finalize if the order hasnt been processed?

				From what I read dont send ur BTC direct if he sends u a receiving address, always go through the escrow system ...<br />He needs to confirm and set the order to in transit before you can do anything just like what the others posted.

				That clarifies a lot.&nbsp; I have come up to this same crossroad.&nbsp; I am awaiting for the seller to go ahead and hit that button so I can FE that shit.&nbsp; Anxiety is killing me, i&#039;m going to burn through all my buds waiting for that page to say something different, it&#039;s only been like five hours&nbsp; &nbsp;:o :o :o :o :o

				Just don&#039;t FE... vendors rip off newbies all the time because they don&#039;t know any better. Complete 5 transactions from 5 vendors who don&#039;t require it to build up your stats. If there isn&#039;t much you want, look for single dosage listings that are cheap, ~$10.
