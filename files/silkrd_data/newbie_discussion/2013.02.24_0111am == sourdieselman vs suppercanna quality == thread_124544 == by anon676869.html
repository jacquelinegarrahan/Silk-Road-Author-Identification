				Check out my stats, I&#039;ve been doing alot of buying on the SR.. Mostly all marijuana.<br /><br />In my expreence with both... SDM hands down!<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Sourdieselman&lt;/b&gt;I&#039;ve ordered a QP of the LD (Cheese) and a QP of the Indoor (Game Changer) both from SDM.. And both the LD and the Indoor were absolutely fantastic!&nbsp; I ordered the LD Cheese about 2-3 months ago and my customers still are asking me if I could get that again.... I WISH I could!... The Game Changer I ordered about a week ago and within 2 days that QP was gone.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t believe the quality of this strain, it was mind blowing!&nbsp; I do alot of my smoking with &#039;old hippies&#039; and they were blown away by this strain.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Supercanna&lt;/b&gt;I ordered a QP with him a few months back and I was less than impressed.... Who knows, maybe I got a bad batch? But for my first orders with a new vender are a lasting effect... It was decent bud, but nothing over the quality that I could get locially.... However, what really put a sore taste in my mouth was how dry it was... It was so dry it pretty much turned into powder when I tried breaking it up.. The QP weighed in at 106g&#039;s (this was the first time I was ever shorted on a bulk order), the worst part was, there was about 20+ grams of shake.&nbsp; I only sell ounces around town for $350-$400.. (East Coast so people will pay top dollar for west coast shit) I couldn&#039;t get rid of his stuff to save my life.. I ended up selling his ounces for $250, I still made a few bucks but I WILL NOT be a return customer to him.. I was embarassed for him for sending the quality of that shit.<br />However, don&#039;t get me wrong, I could have got a bad batch, but venders on here only get one chance from me.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />Bomb
