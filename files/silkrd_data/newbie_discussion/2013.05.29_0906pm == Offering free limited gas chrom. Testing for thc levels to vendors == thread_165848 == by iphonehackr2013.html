				Hey everyone a good friend of mine and I are offering a limited free service to all canabis vendors and growers on Silk Road. We say limited service because we don&#039;t know what to expect as of right now as far as the response from the community will be. Definitely don&#039;t need a hundred packages of weed showing up at our doormats. My life long friend has many years experience in the Labratory and has recently acquired his own with his own gas chromatography set up. Look here http://imgur.com/8VLMTmT with lots of debate and a few beers I have convinced to start a new venture with me by offering a service to vendors to show the public how thier weed stands up to the competition. We would like to offer testing for other substances such as MDMA in the near future. As of right now we just to get some experience under our belt with marijuana first. We did successfully get thc reading for 3 different local strains last night. We our able to test plant material and concentrates as well. Hopefully by Friday we will have set up a page where people can see different reviews of vendors so the all time question of who has the best stuff on SR may finally be answered. If interested please message us

				This is really cool, thanks for offering this service to our community.<br /><br />I hope you live in a state where weed is legal, otherwise this might be too much risk to take on free of charge.

				Your welcome and thank you! I was half expecting to get a huge negative response from some ppl saying we&#039;re just trying to get free weed. Neither one of us smoke. Thanks again hopefully this will really turn into something great

				I plan to be a major vendor within the next 6 months. <br /><br />If you would branch out to testing and documenting the potency of psilocybin containing mushrooms, then I would definitely use your services. <br /><br />Nothing says quality, like a certificate stating specific numbers.<br /><br />Specifically, you would be looking for the quantities of:<br />Psilocybin<br />Psilocin<br />Beocystin<br />Norbeocystin<br /><br />Im curious to see if you are serious or not.
