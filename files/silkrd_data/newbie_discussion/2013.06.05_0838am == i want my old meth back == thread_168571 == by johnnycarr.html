				I used meth for a year or two like over a decade ago. It wasn&#039;t this crystal/shards shit. I know somebody out there knows what I&#039;m talking about. It was good crank! Now I tried this shit from SR from two different vendors just to make sure it was not just a bad batch but it wasn&#039;t....The whole experience was like an OD and there was NO EUPHORIA only profuse sweating, horrible hallucinations, and extreme paranoia! The shards in the bag didn&#039;t even burn all the same so I&#039;m really wondering if it is cut that did that. Should I message the vendors and tell them this? Has anyone else had this problem with this stuff? I miss the good old stuff....now where can I get that?

Meth, MDMA and so on aren&#039;t as good as they were in the old days probably due to some random pre precursor no longer being able to be obtained or something. I vaguely recall a multi tonne shipment of safrole root oil in Cambodiua was what caused a dip in MDMA quality that lasted years. Just meant people found 2CB, MDA and a whole new world of RC&#039;s.<br /><br />There was a literal H drought in parts of the world that lasted over 5 years after Thailand and Cambodia started taking down all the poppy farmers and killing/ arresting the manufacturer/ traffickers. Now only Burma and some other random border parts left of the original golden triangle/ crescent remain.<br /><br />Having said that, They haven&#039;t been able to stop the coke trade or the heroin trade no matter what they have done. Just moved it/ affected its quality/ prices/ increased the incidence of violent crime (cos ppl need to find more money in an addict/ criminal sense and gang/ cartel killings cos its more lucrative).<br /><br />Govts can&#039;t fight it. If they spend enough money and ruin enough lives and take away enough peoples freedom, they can do things that affect the global trade very rarely, but it just shifts demand to something different, it doesn&#039;t stop them. <br /><br />Instead they waste of money fighting them, waste of money arresting them, waste of money imprisoning them, waste of money for customs to find them, waste of money for legal system both prosecution and defense, waste of money putting people onto legal treatment diversions, all just expensive, flawed responses because they are worried how society will PERCEIVE the government doing what is logical and has been logical all along.<br /><br />Wonder if there would be such a thing as a fuel station armed hold up (by some strung out guy that feels like he will die and will DO ANYTHING to not feel that way any more) if Bayer and others still sold morphine snuff powder as an over the counter remedy for headaches and the like for the cost of a pack of gum. I&#039;d bet the answer is no. <br /><br />If they managed to pull every single opium poppy out of the ground tomorrow in the whole world tomorrow. Within a year or two labs will be churning out synthetic opiates at ten times the current rate to make up for the gap in demand.<br /><br />Wow that ended up a rant, sorry.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Me Too.<br /><br />I have had a similar experience with all the meth sold on SR.&nbsp; You are not mistaken in your perceptions.&nbsp; From what I can tell, there is very little real shit mixed in with ALL of the &quot;gear&quot; sold here.&nbsp; I have ordered quite a bit from four different vendors, and none of it has been what I know to be meth.<br /><br />Prior to purchasing this product here on SR, I had been buying my stuff locally for a number of years.&nbsp; I was unhappy with the inconsistency from my supplier in terms of quality as well as hating the exposure of conducting this kind of business.&nbsp; I thought that I would rather take the risk of having something sent to me than the other risks associated with working with someone in person.&nbsp; <br /><br />Figuring out all the details of buying bitcoin, taking the chance on a vendor and all the things that could go wrong in transit, and the extra cost in price from what I was getting locally seemed like a small price to pay for this service...provided I would be getting what was advertised.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />After receiving several shipments, I started looking around for answers to what the hell this stuff could be...and could I salvage any of it?&nbsp; From my experience and research, it appears that there is a cutting agent that resembles the real stuff in almost every aspect...It looks like it, may even taste like it, smokes similarly, and may even &quot;crack back&quot; in an acceptable fashion (for smokers).&nbsp; However, the effect is completely different!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know enough about chemistry or the making of meth to know how this could be possible.&nbsp; I just know that the meth I&#039;ve been getting from any vendor has not been good.&nbsp; I swear I got two shipments of product from two different vendors that was identical! I can&#039;t prove this, but it could be possible that some of the vendors have the same supplier...a mass producer of this bunk shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />I read the meth reviews in the Rumor Mill Forum, as well as anything posted in the Newbie forum, and&nbsp; many senior members seem happy with what they are buying.&nbsp; Does this mean that because they have been around awhile that they actually buy the real deal and that newbies get sold garbage?&nbsp; Or are they just used to this stuff, which totally sucks?&nbsp; Or, are they just not expressing their dismay and simply accepting this as the way it is?&nbsp; <br /><br />I really respect what every reputable vendor is doing here in terms of operating a business.&nbsp; It is not easy to get a selling operation going.&nbsp; It is a lot of hard work,&nbsp; customers can be whiny scammers and sending this product in the mail is very risky.&nbsp; Well, maybe not so risky if the product that is being sent is not authentic.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really wish more meth consumers here on the Road would post their opinions regularly.&nbsp;

				As do I.<br />I find locally the stuff has been cut with what I believe to be GHB. I could tell almost instantly as my jobs began to only get half done and there was too much scatterbaininess. If you get my meaning.<br />I wish Governments and LE to just bite the bullet and legalise all of this shit. At least then we would have rules to keep the product the same.<br />

				Long time buyer here on SR. I feel your pain so let me cut to the chase. Learning to avoid the &quot;top sellers&quot; here on SR was a long and expensive lesson. In fact for a while I thought it was me. It&#039;s not. <br /><br />If you want to keep pulse on who has the good product you&#039;ll need to either spend lots of cash to find it yourself or frequent the meth review thread. Getting to know a couple other regular posters helps. People have more colorful opinions Iin their PMs, especially in that market.<br /><br />But for now here is are some tips you&#039;ll thank me for:<br /><br />For crank: see vendor Reich. He just listed crank (racemic meth). It&#039;s rare to see it listed (or find anywhere for that matter these days). I haven&#039;t tried it yet due to cash flow but he has a good rep. Don&#039;t be put of by him being a UK vendor. It should be as fast as us domestic. If he sees demand then hopefully he&#039;ll keep it stocked and perhaps others will begin to do the same<br /><br />For really really good (legit) crystal meth check out vendor kingcopkiller. Trust me on that. Don&#039;t let numbers or pictues fool you. He operates as smooth as the big volume vendors, difference being his product is actually unadultered meth. And 98% of buyers don&#039;t know what they are talking about in the meth market. You know that from all the bs feedback from the vendor you purchased from already. <br />

				I dabbled in meth when I lived in SoCal in the mid 90&#039;s when according to the DEA, street purity was at an all time high. It made me feel so euphoric and invincible. It was mostly yellowish powder (crank I guess) with a very distinct taste. It burned like a bitch going up the tooter, but man what a feeling.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do stims anymore cause I hate the comedown, so now I stick to opiates. I just made my first SR purchase today. I was tempted to try some heroin as I heard it is the grandaddy of all opiates (I&#039;ve never tried it), but all the mixed reviews of the quality of the dope on SR made me decide to stick to pharms since I know exactly what I am getting. Hope the sellers come through.

				I am so fucking sick of seeing people bitch and moan about the meth on SR... is it old school biker crank?&nbsp; Fuck if I know, but judging from all those who pop up and call it some fucking RC, chances are that it isn&#039;t.<br /><br />Is it really meth?&nbsp; For fuck&#039;s sake, the top vendors really ship meth.&nbsp; Is it GREAT meth?&nbsp; No, but it&#039;s meth.&nbsp; Either the US pharmaceutical industry does NOT produce actual methamphetamine hydrochloride and sell it as desoxyn (hint: they do)... or you&#039;re just straight up wrong.&nbsp; To be clear: the better meth off the Road is comparable to desoxyn.<br /><br />A lot of people are under the impression that what you&#039;re talking about is the difference between racemic methamphetamine (50/50 levo- and dextro- rotary isomers), and nearly straight dextro- methamphetamine.&nbsp; Note that this hypothesis holds with the above point that the meth here is comparable to regulated pharmaceutical dextro-methamphetamine hydrochloride.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been able to confirm this theory with guaranteed racemic methamphetamine, but for my part, I tentatively support the hypothesis based on assumptions about what a product really was + what it did to me (but can you really be sure of the molecule you receive without a fancy lab?)<br /><br />In other words, for fuck&#039;s sake, stop bitching and telling people it isn&#039;t really methamphetamine.&nbsp; It ain&#039;t what you remember, yes, so lots of people have said.&nbsp; Yes, that sucks.&nbsp; But calling the top vendors cheats who don&#039;t ship actual meth ain&#039;t gonna help you get the gear you&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; Be cautious with calling someone an outright scammer who doesn&#039;t ship real product; that&#039;s the sort of thing you really should have actual proof of.&nbsp; Can you name me a fucking research chemical that&#039;ll keep you going for 4 days straight without sleep?&nbsp; Fuck the euphoria, just one that&#039;ll keep you AWAKE for 4 days without being tired.&nbsp; Seriously, can you?&nbsp; &#039;Cause I can&#039;t, personally.<br /><br />To sum up: you want the kind of gear that makes you hard the second it hits your brain and has you fucking for a day and a half?&nbsp; All I have to say is this: get in line, that&#039;s what we all want, fucker :P

				@ everyone above with the kind words, thank you &amp; you are welcome! <br /><br />@charlesnoir: From my experience and what I&#039;ve observed, no, it&#039;s not a common thing for vendors to give better product to long time buyers or well established reviewers. But what often does happen - and it&#039;s easy to succomb to this as a buyer, especially when your high of a new order after going without after a break - is that certain vendors tend to &quot;compensate&quot; with extra weight on an order of their substandard product. So imagine, you&#039;ve been dry for x many days. Your tolerance is down. You are grumpy. All you want is a nice fucking buzz. Suddenly that 8 ball you ordered arrives! Wow, that was quick! You open it. Awesome stealth! OMG a giant intact 4.273 g shard! OMG vendor X is so generous! Never seen a crystal so big right? You have a natural high going before you even test it.<br /><br />So you rail/smoke/whatever. You&#039;re buzzed. And you&#039;re in the mood to talk about it. So you jump on the forum and given a premature review of a product... the buzz of which is largely colored by a) aesthetic appeal and b) &quot;extra&quot; weight <br /><br />Later, the excitement fades and you realize there&#039;s something amiss with the product. It looks the part. It acts most the parts. But it&#039;s either boring or just plain odd in it&#039;s effects. <br /><br />What do you do? Do you recant your report and bite the &quot;generous&quot; hand that fed you? It may also undermine your credibility. You may be dependent on meth. And this is one of the only vendors you can rely on to deliver your fix in a pinch. Do you rock the boat? No, we&#039;ve had to many psychopath vendors threaten buyers in past disputes. Not worth the risk. Not with meth! Add in meth induced paranoia to the equation.<br /><br />So Iinstead you might convince yourself that the problem is just your own tolerance. Or a different&quot; &quot;strain&quot; of meth so to speak (as if that even exists). It&#039;s just &quot;day&quot; meth. Or &quot;clean&quot; meth. Or &quot;marching powder&quot; meth. Instead of that &quot;other&quot; kind of meth... the kind you are after (legit, unadultered meth). That Elixor of Sex (EoS), fun, exciting, overconfident, super euphoric meth that makes your worst day feel like the best- type ofmeth.<br /><br />Descriptors may even become a sort of &quot;hobo code&quot; among some members after a while as r ediculous as it may sound. Or they could&nbsp; mean different things to different people. <br /><br />I hope that made sense and helped to explain how things can be. It&#039;s not universally true, but from my own experience and observation, as well as conversation with others, I believe that this is the reason why it seems that some members appear to get preferential treatment when it comes to quality.<br /><br />Just my personal opinion. I&#039;m sure someone will vehemently disagree on the surface.

I guess I can be smug whether I think so or not, LOL).<br /><br />So that being said, I&#039;d like to ask a really stupid question (and then answer it): what is a molecule?&nbsp; Well, to my knowledge (and in a basic sense), it&#039;s a bunch of atoms that are bonded together.&nbsp; But a molecule is so much more complex than that.&nbsp; A drug influences us because it interacts with our cells and influences our physiology, right?&nbsp; The major factor in that is the structure of the molecule.&nbsp; That structure is determined by the bonds between the atoms, but there are even all different kinds of bonds.&nbsp; I mean for example, C10H15N is the molecular formula for methamphetamine.&nbsp; 10 carbons, 15 hydrogens, and a nitrogen.&nbsp; That&#039;s methamphetamine.&nbsp; It&#039;s also the molecular formula for:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Diethylaniline<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; α-Ethylphenethylamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Isopropylbenzylamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Levomethamphetamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ortetamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Phenpromethamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Phentermine<br /><br />... and others, I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; Same atoms put together in different ways by different bonds.&nbsp; But even if they&#039;re structurally identical, not all molecules are symmetrical: think about your left and right hands.&nbsp; They both have 4 fingers and a thumb, right?&nbsp; But with both palms facing down toward the floor, if you put one hand on top of the other... they aren&#039;t the same.&nbsp; One hand has the thumb sticking out one way, and the other has it sticking out the other.&nbsp; But obviously they&#039;re both still human hands, and you wouldn&#039;t say otherwise -- you might say your left hand is useless for operating the right-buttons on a playstation controller or something, but it&#039;s still a perfectly good hand.&nbsp; Just not good *for everything*.<br /><br />They&#039;re mirror images of eachother.&nbsp; They&#039;re the same exact parts, but they&#039;re put together in a different way.&nbsp; Try to use the mouse hooked up to your computer with your off-hand.&nbsp; Click the button under your index finger, and you&#039;re actually clicking the wrong button.&nbsp; It&#039;s reversed.&nbsp; So both hands have the same exact pieces, they&#039;re put together in almost the same exact way, they have the same structure, and yet the way they interact with things is bizarrely different.<br /><br />... yeah, I realize this is pretty basic stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to patronize anybody.&nbsp; But that&#039;s how complicated something as trivially simple as a hand on a mouse is.&nbsp; Yet they&#039;re both still hands is what I&#039;m getting at.&nbsp; Explaining things helps me solidify ideas in my own head, so take into account I&#039;m also enhancing my own understanding here :)<br /><br />Now consider the unbelievably complex interactions between trillions of &quot;hands&quot; put together all in slightly different ways, and how that might ultimately influence the way those &quot;hands&quot; interact with your brain cells.&nbsp; Then throw in a bunch of impurities because nothing is ever 100% pure, and start considering how those impurities will effect the way those molecules interact with eachother and your brain cells.&nbsp;

Instead of that &quot;other&quot; kind of meth... the kind you are after (legit, unadultered meth). That Elixor of Sex (EoS), fun, exciting, overconfident, super euphoric meth that makes your worst day feel like the best- type ofmeth.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please completely disregard everything I&#039;ve said in this thread prior to this post.&nbsp; Seriously, my only intention here and now is to educate my fellow tweakers.&nbsp; I am not out to contradict anybody or show anybody up or... whatever the fuck else some people think I&#039;m trying to do when I get all serious and logical.&nbsp; I know I sound smug sometimes, but it really is just how I get when I&#039;m in total logic mode -- I don&#039;t mean to come off as smug (in fact I don&#039;t think I do, but I&#039;m told I do online, so... I guess I can be smug whether I think so or not, LOL).<br /><br />So that being said, I&#039;d like to ask a really stupid question (and then answer it): what is a molecule?&nbsp; Well, to my knowledge (and in a basic sense), it&#039;s a bunch of atoms that are bonded together.&nbsp; But a molecule is so much more complex than that.&nbsp; A drug influences us because it interacts with our cells and influences our physiology, right?&nbsp; The major factor in that is the structure of the molecule.&nbsp; That structure is determined by the bonds between the atoms, but there are even all different kinds of bonds.&nbsp; I mean for example, C10H15N is the molecular formula for methamphetamine.&nbsp; 10 carbons, 15 hydrogens, and a nitrogen.&nbsp; That&#039;s methamphetamine.&nbsp; It&#039;s also the molecular formula for:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Diethylaniline<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; α-Ethylphenethylamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Isopropylbenzylamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Levomethamphetamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ortetamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Phenpromethamine<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Phentermine<br /><br />... and others, I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; Same atoms put together in different ways by different bonds.&nbsp; But even if they&#039;re structurally identical, not all molecules are symmetrical: think about your left and right hands.&nbsp; They both have 4 fingers and a thumb, right?&nbsp; But with both palms facing down toward the floor, if you put one hand on top of the other... they aren&#039;t the same.&nbsp; One hand has the thumb sticking out one way, and the other has it sticking out the other.&nbsp; But obviously they&#039;re both still human hands, and you wouldn&#039;t say otherwise -- you might say your left hand is useless for operating the right-buttons on a playstation controller or something, but it&#039;s still a perfectly good hand.&nbsp; Just not good *for everything*.<br /><br />They&#039;re mirror images of eachother.&nbsp; They&#039;re the same exact parts, but they&#039;re put together in a different way.&nbsp; Try to use the mouse hooked up to your computer with your off-hand.&nbsp; Click the button under your index finger, and you&#039;re actually clicking the wrong button.&nbsp; It&#039;s reversed.&nbsp; So both hands have the same exact pieces, they&#039;re put together in almost the same exact way, they have the same structure, and yet the way they interact with things is bizarrely different.<br /><br />... yeah, I realize this is pretty basic stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;m not trying to patronize anybody.&nbsp; But that&#039;s how complicated something as trivially simple as a hand on a mouse is.&nbsp; Yet they&#039;re both still hands is what I&#039;m getting at.&nbsp; Explaining things helps me solidify ideas in my own head, so take into account I&#039;m also enhancing my own understanding here :)<br /><br />Now consider the unbelievably complex interactions between trillions of &quot;hands&quot; put together all in slightly different ways, and how that might ultimately influence the way those &quot;hands&quot; interact with your brain cells.&nbsp; Then throw in a bunch of impurities because nothing is ever 100% pure, and start considering how those impurities will effect the way those molecules interact with eachother and your brain cells.&nbsp; The interactions between molecules -- I mean even before you start considering the interactions of molecules with our physiology -- is tremendously complex.&nbsp; Methamphetamine isn&#039;t a symmetrical molecule.&nbsp;

Some people think that their SR experience and or post count makes them an authority on the subject of methamphetamine. Lot&#039;s and lots of people have only had meth from SR. A good portion of those people seem to gravitate towards certain power sellers with shitty meth and refuse to shop around believing they&#039;re buying the cream of the crop or some shit like that. I truly feel for them at times. I cringe when they praise the same &quot;shitty&quot; product time after time.

				Hey Mossman,<br /><br />I thought your analysis and description of the buying process and finalizing a transaction to be spot on...not just for meth but probably for any substance purchased by a newb.<br /><br />I learned a long time ago that to avoid any unnecessary discomfort, I should be sure to re-stock well before running out of supply.&nbsp; In transitioning from buying off the street to buying exclusively off the Road, I have come perilously close to running on fumes.<br /><br />In frustration with my recent orders here...in particular one that just did not show despite claims of rapid shipping, I called my local guys.&nbsp; They have always been spotty on quality, but completely dependable otherwise.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had been surprised to receive shipments lately from two different vendors from different parts of the country that were so oddly similar in every respect, including the same &quot;shittiness&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mystery solved (?) by checking out the same crap offered to me locally...direct from south of the boarder.<br /><br />Could the mass producers in Mexico be making mostly/only ISO or the like and passing it off as real dope?&nbsp; If the vendors here are supplied by Mexico, this could explain the prevalence of the garbage being sold.&nbsp; The vendors are perhaps just moving what they are supplied with and either not trying the product (doubtful), or just don&#039;t care about offering counterfeit goods.<br /><br />As buyers fear a negative reputation, they leave positive reviews and finalize for this crap, hoping that the next purchase will be better.<br /><br />Instead, vendors see that buyers are o.k. with fake (and probably cheap to the vendors) dope and keep offering it.<br /><br />As you had said in your post, many buyers just do not know what good dope is; perhaps only ever trying stuff they bought here.&nbsp; Add in other factors like anxious newbie buyers not wanting to be blacklisted, and the market supports this fraud.<br /><br />I have to admit guilt for not being blunt in my reviews for fear of the vendor blacklist myself.&nbsp; Aside from being brutally&nbsp; honest in the forums and perhaps reaching out to other members for buying suggestions, what else can serious meth buyers do to correct this unfortunate situation?

				I think that is the reason why real meth may be a thing of the past...<br /><br />All the chemicals needed have been so restricted that it is too difficult and too expensive to make.<br /><br />Look alike substances are being produced and offered as the real thing, namely N-isopropylbenzylamine and n-elthylbenzylamine.&nbsp; The effect is no where near that of real meth.&nbsp; Anyone who has experienced real meth and then bought what looked great but left them feeling flat to depressed had tried this counterfeit dope.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only way this will change is to stop buying the crappy fake product offered as &quot;meth&quot; and demand the real thing.&nbsp;

				Sadly this has not caught the attention of the main stream and changed anything for the better. I still think change could make this product line blast off and be so much more than what it is now. I wait and hope that the consumers will put enough pressure on vendors to make this happen but after almost a year of the same product with little to no change it is becoming quite disheartening. :(
