Don&#039;t order until several dozen reports from active forums members start rolling in. He is using alternate accounts to claim received shipments.

				Thanks for the warning. I&#039;m very much on my guard around here. <br /><br />Though it&#039;s a pain to find vendors that are willing to sell to a newbie without requiring FE, which I&#039;m really not comfortable with. Hopefully I can find one soon.

That being said, new vendors are actually not allowed to require FE, at peril of losing their selling privileges. So perhaps look for new vendors (like us, for example) who are anxious to build their feedback and customer base and will not (cannot) ask for FE. Everybody wins.

				No such thing as reading/learning too much. I&#039;ve been browsing the forums and learning anything I could for months now and still have yet to order. Can never be too safe, best to learn everything you can to protect yourself and the community than make a hasty purchase. Never FE, check forums for vendor reviews, PGP/GPG for ANYTHING you wouldn&#039;t want LE reading, never FE, make sure TBB is up to date, disable ALL plugins, especially javascript, avoid clearnet sites while using tor, never FE, oh, and never FE.<br /><br />Knowledge is power!

				First of all, don&#039;t listen to any Guest accounts. They are all members without accounts that can say whatever they want.<br /><br />Second of all, act like a human being.
