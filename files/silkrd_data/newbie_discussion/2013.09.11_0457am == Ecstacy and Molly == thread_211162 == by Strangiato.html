				Usually I would try to search the internet for help on this one but often it&#039;s full of arguments over topics like this. Is ecstasy the same thing as molly? What is the purest ecstasy can get? You would think it would be 100% but most of the listing on the Road used to be 84% but now I see some 90%.

				in theory, molly should be mdma, but, in practice molly is the new marleting brand, and it might be methylone, or some other stimulant.<br /><br />freebase mdma is an oil at room tempurature, and is distilled to about 99% plus - but when they turn it into a hydrochloride salt, a solid form available in your gut, the added atoms make it 87% pure, give or take. the people saying 90% are rounding up.

				well, with pills you really can&#039;t ever tell what you are getting AT ALL, the actual chemical is hidden by the binding misture, so, you have to trust the reviews of experienced friends about what it is, strength, and quality. Typically, the times that something besides methylone is used, like say the infamous PMA, it will be in a pill.<br /><br />Sometimes pills are great, but, you have to trust your source. As sson as a popular pill gets on the market and gets a reputation for being good, someone will try to copy the design, and dilute the active ingredient.<br /><br />I personally prefer buying in grams of crystals, because you can use look and smell as a personal way to test.<br /><br />Capsules let you look at the contents, and if you see crystals or &quot;sand&quot;, you cna make a fairly good guess about it&#039;s nature. PMA rarely appears in capsules. Capsules are typically put together in smaller amounts by middle level people. The big risk with capsules are that it will be methylone.<br /><br />peopel will say &quot;get a test kit&quot;, and that&#039;s a good idea, but, I usually depend on my senses and my judgement about&nbsp; the source.

				As for pills, (clearnet warning) http://pillreports.com/ is a good resource to get information about a specific pill. Many vendors will link to the pillreport for their product. But Belkamide&#039;s warning still applies: someone might have copied the design. On the other hand, I have had pills with designs that had been around for quite a while, like the nintendo&#039;s, and I am absolutely sure those were the real thing :-) But, of course, trusted vendor.<br />

				Honestly a test kit from bunkpolice is $25 bucks. If you can afford a $70 gram of molly you can afford a test kit to know whats in it. Luckily buying on the SR is pretty safe because people get called out if they sell bunk drugs, but if youre buying at shows/off the street/from your friend down the hall you have no idea what is in it. <br /><br />Ecstasy used to be (and sometimes still is) MDMA pressed into pills. Eventually shitty pill makers started putting cheap other things in their pills to raise profits, so people started buying &#039;molly&#039; because it was supposedly harder to fake. In the past few years dozens of MDMA-like designer drugs have come out that are much cheaper and have much worse side effects and the &#039;molly&#039; demand has skyrocketed, so These drugs are being put into caps and bags instead of MDMA and now its more common to get something besides MDMA than it is to get actual MDMA. <br /><br />Personally, I prefer pills from certain makers. The Q-base group makes famous pills like the defqons, party flocks, mortal kombats, and currently the green androids. The benefit of buying from them is that they quality control their MDMA. When buying MDMA you can test to see that it is actual MDMA but not how good it is (as in purity). Good pill makers use only the best MDMA from holland so you don&#039;t have to worry about how &#039;good&#039; the MDMA you&#039;re buying is. Personal preference of course. Right now I would only buy green androids, blue supermans, nintendos, or red mortal kombats.
