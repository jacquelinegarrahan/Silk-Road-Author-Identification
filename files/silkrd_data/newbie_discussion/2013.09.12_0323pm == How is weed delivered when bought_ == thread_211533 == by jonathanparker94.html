				I got a QP delivered in an oversized jar of peanut butter some vendor had obviously bought from Sams Club! it was hollowed out just enough for them to stuff the bud into. <br /><br />They even resealed the metallic safety lid with Elmer&#039;s Glue to make it look like it was never opened. Then on top of that they shipped it via UPS!<br /><br />The only bad part was that I opened the package going down the road and since i had the sunroof and windows open then all the coffee grounds that were used to mask the smell flew all around my car, now i gotta vacuum it. <br />I didn&#039;t really mind the coffee grounds bcuz the weed was DANK as fuck!<br /><br />Dude don&#039;t worry about it, it gets there! Thousands of people have had grams,ounces,qp&#039;s, and even pounds delivered safely!<br /><br />You should be worried about blending in with regular mail if you are going to be buying alot of stuff, you know setup a home business of some kind, <br /><br />You should read some of the how to articles on this forum and the silk road book on amazon to learn about plausible deniability.<br /><br />
