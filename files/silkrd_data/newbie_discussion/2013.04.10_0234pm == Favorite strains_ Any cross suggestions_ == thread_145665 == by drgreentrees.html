				So my employers in 215ville have a lot of classic as well as new genetics to play with this year. I&#039;d appreciate some feedback from serious smokers about what would make a nice new cross to play with if I manage to grow some males a safe distance away. I&#039;m thinking G13XMasterKushXGDP would be a fun project...anyone?

				&nbsp;8) LAVENDER&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />I had a zip of lavender in college. It&#039;s been sooooo long! My buddies were paying 500 per zip for it. It was the best bud I&#039;ve ever had... Lavender.... If that doesn&#039;t sell like fucking coke on the Road, then the Road is full of uncultured slobs.<br /><br />Lavender, man. Lavender.

				I LOVE lavender. But I&#039;m reluctant to spend time trying to turn it into something it&#039;s not. By that I mean a high yielder. Of course I do it for the love and some high class headies for me and my co-op-ers. But there&#039;s only so many legal plant spaces available in my garden so I have to get the best of ALL worlds. Taste, smell, high, look, medicinal benefit and unfortunately yield. I&#039;ve never gotten more than (or ever seen more than a half P) from a straight up Soma seeds Lavender plant. :(

				My current favorites are Blue Dream, provided it&#039;s well grown and handled (trite choice I know, but it&#039;s popular for a eason). Also a favorite is the incredible &quot;Skush&quot; indica dominate by farmer1.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />:::: Posted simply in the interest of bumping my post count for the silliest posting policy in the entire Interwebs. ::::
