				Life is precious. I don&#039;t know you&#039;re situation and it is your decision but however I believe there are more than enough reasons to be alive, you just have to search within. My advice to you would be to smoke some bomb ass weed and go into a forest and just walk and observe things on a whole new level. I wish you the best of luck I truly do.<br /><br />Peace, Love and Happiness <br />~45

				I&#039;ve stared suicide in the face many times. It&#039;s a dank horrible place to be, I have a lot of sympathy for you and where your head is at. <br /><br />But DON&#039;T DO IT. It passes and you&#039;ll be great again very soon. <br /><br />I was lucky enough to be able to get therapy, which led onto Mindfulness. <br /><br />Check out mindfulness meditation, it&#039;ll change your life: http://www.wildmind.org/mindfulness<br /><br />Also, when you&#039;re down, stop drinking or taking drugs for a couple of weeks if you can and try eat well and get lots of exercise.

				So much positivity in response to this cry for help, it&#039;s really quite heartwarming.<br /><br />If that isn&#039;t indication enough that the world is a GOOD place, full of GOOD people who just want to share the joys of life with you, then I don&#039;t know what is.<br /><br />We all have our ups and downs.&nbsp; Sometimes the downs can be really fucking low.&nbsp; But the ups can also be really fucking high - and they make persevering through the low times MORE than worthwhile.<br /><br />Look after yourself.

				Nothing is so bad you can&#039;t either fix it or leave it!<br />Try to ride the highs and duck the lows.<br />I have picked up the mess from several friends who took that way out and I hate them for doing it. Everyone feels so useless while they try to deal with why you didn&#039;t just talk to someone, anyone. Just go and have a cup of coffee with someone and talk to them.<br />
