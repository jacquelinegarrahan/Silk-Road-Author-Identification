				silo deals with 25c-NBOMe and other phenatylamines, tryptamines, and soon, arylcyclohexylamines... he recently was offering 5 blotter hits with 1,000 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe on them for a mere 0.03 BTC. i didn&#039;t know if i had to pay for shipping too, or if the 0.00BTC option worked. i&#039;m down to my last few hundredths of a BTC from my first Bitcoin and week of buys on the SR. i told silo i wanted to try the blotter, just didn&#039;t have enough to afford shipping. he sent me 0.03BTC thinking i needed it to afford the listing. the 0.00BTC shipping option was a valid one, so i didn&#039;t need the BTC. HOW AWESOME IS A VENDOR THAT HELPS YOU PAY FOR THEIR SAMPLE OF A NEW PRODUCT?!?! i returned the BTC that silo sent me since i didn&#039;t need them; but that does not make his act of kindness any less (and he said the good karma from my act would be rewarded). i will let y&#039;all know about how the 25c-NBOMe is when i get it (and what three other people besides me think...). but, silo deserves a review already! buy from silo knowing you are supporting a good human being (a rare find in today&#039;s world)!<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

				I am also looking forward to my sample from Silo. I have also just started making my first purchases after several months of research/lurking in order to get comfortable ordering. Silo was very helpful sending me messages with a quick turnaround after I had a couple of general questions. I will also have a couple of close friends try as well and will post our experiences on his official thread once I reach the 50 post threshold.
