				So lets clear some things up for me has the silkroad servers really been compromised for the last 3 months? meaning that they really do have all unencrypted addresses? because ive been making orders all the time for the past couple months and some were unencrypted.. actually just got a package this monday that i didnt encrypt so wouldnt that mean they have my address?&nbsp; Why would nothing ever happen can they access certain buyers accounts and see transaction history is this all possible or do they not have any of this info im so lost

				We have been advised to assume the worst-case scenario, like they have a list of marked houses or addresses or something.&nbsp; Vendors should move all operations immediately and as for users, well our houses have probably been redflagged.&nbsp; I also got an order on monday.&nbsp; But mail stopped coming to me so I&#039;m kinda worried, like they are collecting it all but I know that&#039;s ridiculous.&nbsp; There were 1 million SR users do you think it&#039;s feasible that if even 1/10th of those were in the united states (aka 100 thousand or ~.3% of the population) would it be possible for them to flag all of our addresses and have all our mail collected?&nbsp; I mean it&#039;s possible in a police-state but very unlikely...I think (hope) it&#039;s just a major coincidence that a lot of us are reporting no mail as of late.<br /><br />BTW&nbsp; I thought the govt was supposed to shut down, like no more DEA, but NOOOO.&nbsp; I WAS WRONG.&nbsp; Instead they are shutting down shit like Education and Planned Parenthood and healthcare.&nbsp; FUCK.
