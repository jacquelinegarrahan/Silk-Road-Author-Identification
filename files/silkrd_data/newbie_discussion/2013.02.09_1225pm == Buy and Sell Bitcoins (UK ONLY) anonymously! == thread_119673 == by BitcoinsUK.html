				I Managed to get to the proper forums http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124180.msg850354#new<br /><br />Well hello there folks.<br /><br />First of all I&#039;d like to start off by stating that this is not a scam, no CC information will be asked for, I am simply offering a service to buy and sell bitcoins through Silk Road.<br /><br />At the moment for UK users it is a bit of a nightmare getting coins. I offer a service that hopes to change all that. I offer BTC, below market rate and with no commission fees!<br /><br />I have been working with users and vendors here on Silk Road to create a system where UK users can reliably and securely buy &amp; sell their bitcoins. <br /><br />Check out my profile at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f76d1ab300 and you will see there are various options.<br /><br />If you become a member you can contact me any time to arrange the buying or selling of coins. Or if you just want to do a 1 off purchase or sale that can be done too. <br /><br />Here&#039;s how it works:<br /><br />If you want to purchase coins you simply decide how much you want to spend (minimum £20 and must be dividable in notes), pick up one of my listings, and in the address box you put how much you wanna buy.<br />Now when you do this it has to be PGP encrypted, and the message must also include your public key so I can reply with an encrypted message of where to send the cash.<br />The best part is, at this point the coins will be sent to you straight away - you don&#039;t need to wait for me to receive the money!<br />This of course means that I will be very choosy on who to accept as buyers, and if you have been a member for less than 3 months and spent less than 10btc, there is no point in even asking as I will ignore you.<br />The only fee you incur is the cost of an envelope and a stamp, that is my fee!<br /><br /><br />If you were wanting to SELL bitcoins, now then it works pretty much the same way. You pick a listing and work out how many coins you want to sell, and I will reply letting you know if I can afford to buy those coins off you.<br />As I am new here, when I buy coins I am willing to wait until you receive the cash before you release the coins to me. This way it helps me build up a trust level. When I send the cash it will be sent recorded delivery.<br /><br />A few notes - I&#039;ve been working on this system for a few weeks/months now, with various vendors and users, so that the most secure way could be figured out.<br /><br />This is only open to UK people!<br /><br />If you have any questions please feel free to ask them here, PM me, or message me on the Road.<br /><br /><br />My profile&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f76d1ab300<br />Membership&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2da6884805<br />One-Off Purchase&nbsp; &nbsp;http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2862307ec4<br />One-Off Sale&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b3cdee47f4<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.19 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFEPibIBCAC7+aSq984R9PfLNQCXhHnSIDrY1W6CnA/ZR2i87lWDES94DRxZ<br />bsNPQBqk2gN5uKQBBm2L7MVUvjgHEHkY3xPkCLr7KEmvefSOrwacS57cC15ir//6<br />voUjBlEqfc/HMRuaMEDKcG9FIVUUhGZFXANVnJyVa8IXdTncYie9QZiPGWqEyMpG<br />TapeZZ+RAwPC6hmp4peNIWF5Q3R0+UVIV0bl7DbxjufhGSPxNLcwJHk3OX8335Jy<br />LgB3gignijGwaLFlJDyDgckiU2rrRmwKE80GeqrD/mO9ZiML1rU6iwe7vJLKXj6x<br />zj7hyHWL5IlVhCM8YiGBaSSb9Sb6FW/LNCNNABEBAAG0CkJpdGNvaW5zVUuJATgE<br />EwECACIFAlEPibICGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJENxqtLM9<br />4HpxhxoH/3ulujKWBS5WpbZxnOCdw0xeF9ZSK1ItVhYr6E5pbhKlikbI/GCNRrFt<br />lV1nQmS+f2+pDsD32AdYySvBQxCzLllW+5sJVCcJWLVGOnPAmdlS7qr3G4qA6D0J<br />ywVt+lAsk9KBGN1J4wKPpU8guosdL0JuWp9MpbWbJQub23zSOgq1PIXAXJ5qhdJ0<br />TjaxjDe40xiSbdvuYwN8sRrGf/f2q1KtV1Xg2n+IfoMu2sRwE7L53UKBWsv8jvn+<br />4m6y4QksGeANxgFBcYXZpNvcnsgoyf+3Dr0QhMPL7CdqLcbi3QSfcgEj81P2G1Cy<br />ladFrtzQnWoNL9gmgSNgFfWCEuqe86i5AQ0EUQ+JsgEIAMdssIJjvHJx4EUPiUoT<br />o8ukrZAhNhXtNUqvBOFJSkIpNTeywh2K7I/tmJL8kosfxWiIr3q7iKeh2FD3ftpa<br />OJVPh8Fg3HE6NWkZQnsbuamvFTUGN1yylQOmMxhKsm+x985iUxFtqBcWah2Z/WRV<br />TzrsbPLEGp1kszRzNjksYAKkm5LNxqGLgrLKr5UUL327ccLFUaBLQiaXwoxG6k21<br />yEuK0p41Uw/kUQXYWfekvumHZsf3W6wX57JDHklWhqKZdR2Ficng8gNDXW1y0B6K<br />3CcsBbLWc4DV9VRoWIcxNdSAK2kSyEl5mGUJtmsSDvt9a/+jta1T0+QPcu8Vg18n<br />6isAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUCUQ+JsgIbDAAKCRDcarSzPeB6cYbrB/9RBI/DCAxY<br />fVFY6AbGm72tbB++Y2FMvJ6Ne8jpqVD8GVEUb4d0ULQ54fC0tOgqTWUvFO9rHizs<br />srJBlQaLwZSILlnH+s+5CfV/S+p7/YSNh7L2xG2lJVDdTxg8cdUeg8z/vbh2JCzn<br />tCZ0iXAEyJiOEDRrD6n9EfQarIibuN3t12P3iIcZlqeaF/0d10yalRxvKkHubEPY<br />ri1/lXtZARyDC+WzjSMTrVv9xow8g28SxGf6ThAgWik1WMcDpcxbiPMgKcbVHOFr<br />MaSLVQkBKnqSS6f5uDiXF90lwFQVAoLLkfLKkQMqI6jKHtI1Dn1nq7FotsgLuLv+<br />kf4taN3N40Jo<br />=Njei<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />

				blockchain.info<br /><br />Block chain.info charges about 60p per bitcoin more than this guy.&nbsp; So a bitcoin costs £15.10 rather than £14.50.<br /><br />You can send money directly from your own bank and the whole process usually takes about 10 minutes (it can take upto 4 hours but In my experience its quite quick).<br /><br />The site is used by tens of thousands of people and has been around for quite some time.<br /><br />

				Duckman this service is more for people who don&#039;t want to (or can&#039;t) use banks, also as it uses the Silk Road username to move coins, once a deal is agreed it&#039;s pretty much guaranteed to be in your account within minutes unless their is a problem with Silk Road itself.

				Why thank you sir :)<br /><br />As I&#039;m just starting it&#039;s very slow, there&#039;s that initial trust issue that makes people wary. I spent several weeks working with established vendors, I should get them to post in here to say I&#039;m legit, maybe help people feel a bit better.

				Interesting, get this right and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll do very well! I imagine I&#039;ll be using your services at some point soon.<br /><br />Couple of questions if I may:<br /><br />Did I read there&#039;s 3 days to get the cash to you? (When buying off you) What happens if you don&#039;t receive by then? Either down to a genuine fault with Royal Mail or through the sender not sending.<br /><br />Is Tor chat necessary with a membership or can we just use e-mails?<br /><br />Best of luck.

				Questions are very welcome.<br /><br />&quot;Did I read there&#039;s 3 days to get the cash to you? (When buying off you) What happens if you don&#039;t receive by then? Either down to a genuine fault with Royal Mail or through the sender not sending.&quot;<br /><br />Having worked with people before &quot;opening&quot; I found that it is pretty impossible that a letter doesn&#039;t get to someone within 2 days in the UK. I sent 100+ letters out during testing and received well over 500 (my drop address wasn&#039;t too impressed about this..I kinda didn&#039;t tell him that we were doing such a high volume ha), so the only way that I don&#039;t receive the money is if someone is trying to rip me off. I would actually prefer if people sent it recorded delivery as all blame will be on their side if it doesn&#039;t turn up, it just doesn&#039;t happen in the UK mail.<br /><br />I spoke with several UK vendors and roughly 0.1% of UK to UK shipments genuinely didn&#039;t arrive. This is while shipping drugs. If you turn that into just a letter with some notes put inside, common sense and law of probability would show that it&#039;s going to get there.<br /><br />It may seem harsh to put all blame on my customer, but is necessary to be deterrent against scammers. This is also why I am picking and choosing my customers, and they must have good stats - a buyer isn&#039;t going to risk his account by not sending me the money any more than he would lying about a UK vendor not having him shipped something - this is where my whole thing about trust comes in :)<br /><br />It&#039;s also why I offer to send the coins before having received the money, to show that I have faith in the mail system and to show that my intentions are honest and I expect the user to do the same. There is a much higher urge to rip me off if the task of doing it is actually easier than you doing the right thing (much in the way that, while you wouldn&#039;t steal a CD from a shop, you&#039;d rather pirate it because it&#039;s free and actually easier than paying for it - and no I am not getting into the whole piracy is stealing/not stealing debate it simply serves as an analogy :))<br /><br />And I assume the question is going to get asked: what about my end ? I&#039;m more than happy to send any cash payment as recorded delivery to super duper make sure, but I have perfect faith in the mail system and would expect you to get the cash lickity split!<br /><br />&quot;Is Tor chat necessary with a membership or can we just use e-mails?&quot;<br /><br />Once you&#039;re a member you&#039;re free to contact me however you like asking to buy or sell coins, it&#039;s just torchat seemed the most direct and fastest - while I am in front of the computer it will pop up and say &quot;look at meee!&quot;, while I may have gaps of hours wherein I don&#039;t check Silk Road. If you wish to email me (I&#039;d prefer messages on Silk Road or these forums to keep it all in one place) that is completely up to you.<br /><br />Hope this helps clear it up, sorry for being long winded but I feel it is important to be so concise on that point :)<br />

				Have just put in an order for a small amount of BTC. Due to my lack of transactions, we agreed on half of the coins being given up-front and the rest on receipt of cash. I&#039;ve already received the first half, and am confident the rest will be on its way on receipt of payment.<br /><br />Good comms so far and fair rates for once. Will update on Thursday.

				It all sounds good in theory but what do you do if money gets lost in the mail?<br /><br />You said that vendors report that only 0.1% of all deliveries don&#039;t arrive.&nbsp; That must make me the unluckiest person on SR.&nbsp; I am currently waiting on a domestic UK package, from a trusted vendor, that I ordered over a week ago.<br /><br />My brother, who lives in a different city made an order last year, from a different but again highly respected vendor, and the package never turned up.<br /><br />In both cases the vendors say that it was sent.<br /><br />So what happens to the poor sod whose money doesn&#039;t reach you?

				Hi there,<br /><br />In normal instances, what is being shipped is an illicit/illegal substance, so some care has to be taken to both hide it&#039;s contents and be very stealthy when posting it. However with mine, as it is legal, and a normal letter, there is no reason for the post to suspect it, to hold it, or to lose it or give it to police etc.<br /><br />So the risks are shaved right right down in that sense, it is simply money being sent through the post, something that is completely legal and nobody&#039;s business, but if it did need to be investigated then it would be OK to - I could go ask about a missing package of money, but no drug dealer in his right mind is going to ask about his missing drugs are they ?<br /><br />So while drug deals done here have a hands-off approach when it comes to lost shipments, I can in fact be hands on and chase it up, with no worries about the legal side of it :)<br /><br />

				OK so if I were to send you £500 in the post and it didn&#039;t arrive (its sent via recorded delivery and I can provide a reference number) are you going to foot the bill for that £500?<br /><br />I am pretty sure that the post office do not insure cash that&#039;s sent via the postal service (they say not to sent cash via the mail).<br /><br />If you, personally, were not prepared to pick up the tab for that money then what is the advantage to the average UK SR user?&nbsp; I can certainly see a vendor or major buyer would want to use a completely anonymous service, but the average guy in the UK really doesn&#039;t need to worry about bank transfers to buy bitcoins so it would seem to be an unnecessary risk to use a service where the cash was sent uninsured in the mail when an instant bank transfer is a viable and readily available option.<br /><br />Perhaps you could also consider offering a bank transfer system for small deposits too.<br />

				Hi there,<br /><br />Those are great points which I didn&#039;t cover in my other answers so thank you. In the case of someone giving me proof which I can then validate then I will in fact take the hit - I can&#039;t expect a normal user to foot the bill for something that is completely out of their control when I&#039;m running a currency service. But really the chances are of it ever happening are so magnificently slim that if it did happen, it can be quite happily be recorded as an operating loss.<br /><br />The same also holds true for money going in the other direction, if cash never arrives at someone&#039;s house and I can prove Royal Mail is at fault, then I will again foot the bill and resend the money.<br /><br />But I have to stress how much test post we sent out, it was an absolutely epic number, and decently wrttten letters just don&#039;t go missing.<br /><br />Although your question has made me think of a rather good compromise I am thinking that for customers who want a large amount of coins, say £500, then I will get them to send 2 letters, that way in case one of them is lost it&#039;s a much smaller hit - as I&#039;m just starting out, losing £500 would be near-catastrophic!<br /><br />As to the question about bank transfers unfortunately this is just never going to happen. The addresses where the money are sent to will change, and they are not my addresses, but people I work with. If I was to offer a bank service I would be giving people my bank details and that&#039;s just somethng I&#039;m never even going to entertain. However in the future I will start offering a service where I can drop the money into the buyer&#039;s banks instead of me posting it. That way it gets there the same day, and also, woo it&#039;s in your bank!<br /><br />Right now though I&#039;m focusing on building a small reputation, working with some reliable customers, and just trying to gain a bit of trust without getting bitten myself :)<br /><br />Oh also your point about the average UK user is indeed valid but it&#039;s less to do with the anonymous service and more to do with any service at all - getting bitcoins UK the UK is not only a bit of a pain, but expensive. Intersango and Bitcoin-Central both deal in GBP but both offer coins at way over market value. Also, some customers are overly &quot;paranoid&quot;, even though they&#039;re simply a customer buying a few drugs, they still have a certain level of distrust towards exchanges so the privacy and anonymity wins out in the face of certain possible dangers.<br /><br />Any other questions feel free to ask :)

				BTW you might want to consider using either a PO box or a business mail box.<br /><br />The PO box is obviously a PO box, but the business mail boxs are run all over the country by private companies that let you do things like rent office space on an ad hoc basis, they offer things like a receptionist, i.e. someone rings and gets put through to a call center where someone pretends that they are your receptionist and so on.<br /><br />Well one of the services offered is a PO box but its not called a PO box and you just have a normal looking address.<br /><br />The great thing with this is that with a little bit of fake id, you can open one of these and then change the address every month or so and its not like a private company is going to scrutinize you too much as they just want your cash really.<br /><br />Im not sure of rates but I&#039;d imagine it would be no more that £50 a month and probably a bit less.

				That is definitely something I&#039;d be interested in down the line but right now I find my model is perfect. Because I&#039;m not dealing drugs, simply selling currency, the legal wranglings and need for cloak and dagger are massively reduced.<br /><br /><br />In fact I&#039;ll be registering myself as a proper business and paying taxes so I am completely legit, so the need for anonymity against LE would be removed completely,<br />

				Maybe I was exaggerating before about being the unluckiest person on SR.<br /><br />The package I have been waiting for over a week for has finally arrived!<br /><br />Its also underweight!<br /><br />I also cannot log onto SR to message the vendor as the connection keeps timing out, in fact I haven&#039;t been able to log on for several days now.<br /><br />Maybe I wasn&#039;t exaggerating.&nbsp; People think I have a knack of spotting potential problems before they arise, but in truth I&#039;m usually its&nbsp; just something that happened to me in the past.<br />

				&nbsp;Ah that sucks. Maybe the vendor made a mistake and will send you the difference, maybe even through in a bonus! Then again you have to wonder how many customers own scales, so it would work out for a vendor to underweigh everything and simply fix it when someone brings it up.

				Maybe setup a pingit account if your going to go legit or for larger order&#039;s no bank detail&#039;s given to anybody that doesn&#039;t need to know just use a PAYG phone not your own if yyou dont want to give your private mobile number out, you can use any bank doesn&#039;t have to be barcley&#039;s, you lose a bit of the annonimous factor but if people really are paranoid about mr police man stopping a letter or recorded delivery,(they should be slapped for being so para :P) they can use pingit, I&#039;m not that paranoid it&#039;s the Uk for fuck&#039;s sake and it&#039;s a few quid this aint exactly scarface.The law&#039;s of probability say your money will get there and his money will get to you, i&#039;ll member up it&#039;s a better rate than any exchange your gonna find for Uk coin,hopefully nobody screw&#039;s them over, sound&#039;s like a genuine guy/woman/hermaphrodite,,,lol, just trying to make an extra few quid to keep the wolve&#039;s at bay,(I could be dead wrong) and if a £500 loss would be catastrophic you can be pretty sure they&#039;re not doing it to get rich,(but I may be wrong) and if they&#039;re sending the coin and cash to you before you have to make payment anybody that rip&#039;s them off whether it be for 1 coin or 100 coin&#039;s should be strung up,(I&#039;m not wrong on this).<br />I hope the Uk buyer&#039;s see this for what it is and use it respectfully,if Bitcoin&#039;s UK stay&#039;s with the same policy they have now they will be without doubt the best coin seller in the Uk for small coin purchase&#039;s<br />I&#039;de definatly want to be a member I&#039;ve only been here a month but I think I got respectable stat&#039;s for a month.<br />Hope it work&#039;s out i&#039;ll be in touch.<br />Peace<br />&nbsp;8)

All of costs you is ฿0.11 and the price of a stamp. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t wanna faff around with blockchain and it&#039;s 5.97% fee, go see BitcoinUK instead. <br /><br />Great service for uk people. <br />

				I just wanna chime in and say that you can deal with BitcoinsUK with no worries whatsoever.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought coins from him about 8 times now I think. <br /><br />Always superfast deposit of coins into your wallet.<br /><br />Elements of trust are required, certainly. <br />My first purchase was a small amount, to test the legitimacy / standards of his service.<br /><br />I&#039;ve since completed much bigger deals with him, amid again, no drama whatsoever.<br /><br />Do you want coins, buy you don&#039;t want to give blockchain 5.98%, and you don&#039;t wanna get ripped off by other ฿itcoin vendors?&nbsp; <br /><br />Well then, go see BitcoinsUK. <br />I believe in his service 100%, there is even a link to his profile in my sig. - decent, honest vendors need, and deserve recognition for what they do.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t wanna reveal too much is to re: his process, but it is FAST, and SIMPLE.<br />And 100% anonymous.<br /><br />He sells you coins, (costs ฿0.11 to place an order) the&nbsp; you send himself cash via a registered/signed-for letter.<br /><br />AND he gives you the coins, even you&#039;ve not yet sent the money. But my advice? Do the decent thing and send him thr tracking number asap after discharge. <br />I believe there is a 50% now 50% after money is received type rule, for new customers, but that is only fair, imo.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I will now always go to BitcoinsUK for my coinage needs.<br />THIS is definitely the best way to get coins in the UK.<br /><br />Decent vendors need recognition, and BitcoinsUK is at the top of my list.&nbsp;
