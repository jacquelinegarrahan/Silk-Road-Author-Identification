				Hey guys,<br /><br />I read a lot of things on the Shipping forum about seized packages, controlled deliveries, etc, and something came up to my mind.<br /><br />What if I bought 1kg of cocaine and have it delivered to an enemy&#039;s house? If a LEA get the package, how would this person prove his innocence?<br /><br />I&#039;m asking because it can be that easy sending someone to jail for something received by mail.

				I would assume they&#039;d try and do some sort of controlled delivery, if they accepted/signed for the package, they&#039;d raid their house, see if there was anything that pointed towards drug dealing, scales, baggies, gel caps etc. I&#039;d assume they&#039;d also seize there phone/computer and see if there was anything on it. If they got nothing from the house raid/seized electronics, they wouldn&#039;t have much of a case at all, at most it would probably be a major inconvenience for your enemy.<br /><br />Who has that kind of money to throw away anyway?

				I had the same thought kinda, my bro smokes ,but I have not told him about SR, cause I like pills and don&#039;t want the questions of what I get, anywho I&nbsp; was thinking &quot;what if I bought him some for his bday and had delivered to him (saying something like your bday should be in mail&quot; but then what if package got seized ect..... we live 500 miles apart so .. although the sentiment was nice I nixed the idea, cause he would have paraphernalia at house
