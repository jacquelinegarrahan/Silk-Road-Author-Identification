				I mean this in the nicest and most informative way possible...<br /><br />First... IF YOU WANT TO BE SAFE ON THE ROAD THEN TAKE YOUR FACEBOOK URL OFF OF HERE!!! YOU HAVE SEVERELY COMPROMISED YOUR ANONYMITY!!!!<br /><br />Second.. Vendors want BTC because as said before it is virtually untraceable. BTC IS MONEY! you must purchase BTC for the dollar amount (or what ever currency you use) to have that amount of money on the road. Not to mention that unless you FE (not advised) then you&#039;re cash stays very safe in the escrow system. Point is, You need to learn about silk road before giving out such sensitive information.<br /><br />I and many others will be glad to help you out. Do correct your errors if you wish to not have the police kicking down your door!

				It&#039;s not that anyone is scamming.&nbsp; You just don&#039;t know any of the essential info on how this system works.&nbsp; You have to actually do the research and proceed carefully.&nbsp; Otherwise you shouldn&#039;t fuck around with any of this shit.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t seem like you&#039;re being too careful about anonymity so I&#039;d guess you&#039;re not ready.

				Hey, I say let this kid go on with his bro-chant about how &quot;cash is king&quot;. Rick Cusick from High Times warned me about people like this and how - in the future - personal privacy will be scoffed upon and rejected by the mainstream, globalized cultural structure. Here is what he was talking about - what a fucking jackass to post your facebook profile to the SR forums, and if we aren&#039;t careful he won&#039;t be the last. In all honesty, we should probably do our best to encourage people with such obvious naivety so other losers like this don&#039;t ruin the beautiful opportunities we have here.

				This scares the shit out of me. You know you see this posted here and you wonder how anyone could be so naive but shit, I never feel safe enough on this place. Not even on the forum. Unless you know every aspect of all the tehnology and the encryption all the stealth, how police or customs operate, how to know if you are even being watched or not, how to know the Tor network inside and out and on and on... I doubt many of us on here do. I bet we all leave some kind of evidence in some form or other that could find its way back to you somehow.<br />This is what worries me. Whether you believe what you hear on the mainstream media or if its all bullshit or not is another question but just assume this is true and think about how safe are you really and how much do you really know about the technology you are using right now.<br />If Chinese hackers can break in to the US military computers and steal top secret defense technology files then how safe are we here on SR?<br />Imagine the stealth and encryption and everything set up to defend these files and yet someone else (the Chinese) can still break it open and take what they want. When you think your operation is all safe and encrypted and covered compare your operation to what would be the most guarded and you would assume most safest computer networks and files in the world. I dont feel 100% safe on SR even without posting my real name and facebook link in my signature. <br />Im just saying you can all laugh at this kid but how safe is anyone on here? Authorities must have technology to access beyond what defenses you have in place. You can minimize your risk and be smart but I never feel 100% confident on here. <br />We may laugh at the stupidity of others but who might be watching you and laughing back at you is what scares me. <br />Im now expecting to see my bad karma take a hit but thats just my thought anyway.<br />&nbsp;

				Also man if you think about it, even though SR pisses LE off cause they scratch their heads all day probs tryina crack this shit lol ;p SR is still just a small skid mark in a 100XL underwear full of drug smuggling in this world. SR is not the real target, bust dealers on Silk road and another person with enough capitol and motivation will be wayyy more than eager to step up. Makes me wonder how much effort they really are putting into whatever the fuck they are trying to do to SR, anyways still stay safe as possible, you never know who&#039;s watching...

Im sorry to sound negative about it especially when I know less than yourself on the topic. Im just paranoid by nature. Im not trying to spread fear, Im just saying I do have some myself.

Persona profiling (that is building a profile of a person by examining their writing style, topics discussed; approximating their geographical location by assessing slang used, visual clues given out in seemingly vague descriptions, etc..)<br />2. linking ones tor usage and clear-net usage. *one example would be if someone chatted a lot on tor forums about buying or selling very specific items. And they also were posting about or doing a lot of closely related searches on clear-net websites.<br />3. honeypot exit nodes (not directly as scary as they sound, due to the difficulty a LE/Gov controlled node would have in trying to choose which data streams to pick up to try and match random bits of data with other random bits of data at the entry points. (matching an exit node up with an entry node is not something that can be done in any direct way.)&nbsp; In my mind I can imagine the quickly growing data centers that record every single packet that passes between user and ISP being utilized by likewise ever increasing super computer capabilities at LE/Gov disposal to try and more accurately match up those seemingly random bits of data at either end of entry/exit to.......<br /><br />yea, tired..<br /><br />@OP decent troll. 5/5 for originality and so few people getting it. 4/5 for potentially bringing heat on the owner of the random profile you searched out until you found one mentioning SR.<br /><br />and JUST IN CASE you are serious.

The way ive always seen it, first hand.. Is when one dealer gets popped, there are another 3 to fill those shoes. It will be never ending.<br /><br />Take the Netherlands for example.. there is little, if any at all, serious drug problems.. From my understanding, when it comes to drugs over there, their policy is sort of this.. do what you want to do, if you want to kill your self, do it. Now, because of that mentality, giving people the freedom and choice to do or not to do hard life ruining drugs, people for the most part, will choose not to smoke crack or shoot heroin and so on.<br /><br />&nbsp;I forget which it was, but there was a doc on it, war on drugs maybe it was called, idk, but they where int he Dam, and to even find a crack head, they had to pay a local pot dealer to bring them to one. Hard drugs tearing apart communities, is nearly non existent there. <br /><br />&nbsp;Its human nature, you tell people they arnt allowed to do something, they will naturally go against that. People want what they are told they can not have.

You know you see this posted here and you wonder how anyone could be so naive but shit, I never feel safe enough on this place. Not even on the forum. Unless you know every aspect of all the tehnology and the encryption all the stealth, how police or customs operate, how to know if you are even being watched or not, how to know the Tor network inside and out and on and on... I doubt many of us on here do. I bet we all leave some kind of evidence in some form or other that could find its way back to you somehow.<br />This is what worries me. Whether you believe what you hear on the mainstream media or if its all bullshit or not is another question but just assume this is true and think about how safe are you really and how much do you really know about the technology you are using right now.<br />If Chinese hackers can break in to the US military computers and steal top secret defense technology files then how safe are we here on SR?<br />Imagine the stealth and encryption and everything set up to defend these files and yet someone else (the Chinese) can still break it open and take what they want. When you think your operation is all safe and encrypted and covered compare your operation to what would be the most guarded and you would assume most safest computer networks and files in the world. I dont feel 100% safe on SR even without posting my real name and facebook link in my signature. <br />Im just saying you can all laugh at this kid but how safe is anyone on here? Authorities must have technology to access beyond what defenses you have in place. You can minimize your risk and be smart but I never feel 100% confident on here. <br />We may laugh at the stupidity of others but who might be watching you and laughing back at you is what scares me. <br />Im now expecting to see my bad karma take a hit but thats just my thought anyway.<br />&nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i think as long as i follow the guidelines on these forums i am pretty safe. you&#039;re right, i do not know all the insides and outs of all the technology and software used to buy things on SR properly. i doubt the majority of people do. i could not do this without a community of people who are dedicated to the cause. reading as much as i can and following the procedures and advice of forum members is pretty much all you can do. if someone still doesnt feel comfortable with their security then they should buy on the street or not buy at all. i think this is a great example of what can be done when a bunch of people come together for something they believe in. from the people who are very computer savvy and write guides and teks for everyone to the members who answer a question they know or correct something they see someone doing unsafe. its as a group everyone can survive individually. <br />one of the most important things i do is just order small personal amounts. honestly i dont think LE has the time or money to go chasing down individuals who buy small personal amounts. when you buy bulk to sell i think most people know they are taking on higher risk. LE wants big busts. they want to move up the chain and shut down organizations. i dont think they care about 1 guy who likes to buy a gram of mdma once in a while. everytime i read about someone getting busted its always larger amounts. i have never heard anyone telling a story about having there 1/2 gram of blow caught and now facing legal troubles. maybe i&#039;m wrong?

				True shit, and even if most illicit drugs like crack and heroin were completely legalized and controlled substances, no person that was against it before is going to be like, &quot;Oh great now its legal to smoke crack, I think I&#039;ll go try that now =D&quot; But in contrast, telling people, &quot;YOU CAN NEVER DO THIS, NEVER EVER TOUCH THESE THINGS!&quot; Just like a child in a toystore, people are going to engage solely for the reason that they are forbidden to engage.

				Ive done 10~ or so orders on SR, All from vendors with 99-100 Rep and over 100 transactions.<br /><br />I have always received the exact product I ordered, at the advertised quality, and sometimes an extra point or two.<br /><br />Are there scammers here? Fuck yes, its a free market, that attracts scammers like flies to shit. Can you almost completely avoid them by being smart and not being the risk taker when it comes to new vendors? Absolutely.

				You should never underestimate your enemy @Redbreast. If you truly think that guy is a Cop then that must be the worst attempt at getting People busted. Also the one think that can be is if you click his Facebook link authorities would get the IP from the actual user that clicked that page, and saving it for further investigations.<br /><br /><br />However i think that mostly FBI/Cybercrime devision is browsing this Forum and not just your local 0815 cop...

He must learn about info security and become more down to earth. Lets scam him and help him.. Can you be sooo stupid?<br />&nbsp;I have seen it all right now!!! What could it be next? A kid sending his card number and pin?<br /><br />I am glad though that such people exists. Makes me feel good in a way.<br /><br />Take care people<br />Adamiz<br /><br />

				You will not be scammed if you refuse to FE.&nbsp; If a vendor ask you to FE, dont.&nbsp; If they ask you to FE after you&#039;ve ordered or yourorder will be cancelled, let them cancel it.&nbsp; There are plenty of vendors who will allow you to stay in escrow, even if you are a newbie. Never FE.

I know it&#039;s harsh, but the business would collapse if I continued giving all the profit away to questionable transactions stuck in resolution...I just clearly now state the situation and if someone is happy to transfer the risk to themselves - I then transact with integrity. They can base the decision on my reviews and notification of success there...if they are not comfortable, they can try to find a quality vendor who will enter Escrow...but good luck with that...as far as I know, we are all in the same boat and of the same opinion...unless we have a relationship built over time, we are just not interested as the risk is too high now.<br /><br />Just my 5 cents to balance your point...<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Doc

				Yes its all a big scam!!! Better dont buy here, as this place is much more safer if people as you are not getting involved.<br />Better buy local around the block with cash at a dealer than appreciate you cash (maybe so much to give you cutted drugs) But don&#039;t mind at least you have not beedn scammed here on the road ;-)
