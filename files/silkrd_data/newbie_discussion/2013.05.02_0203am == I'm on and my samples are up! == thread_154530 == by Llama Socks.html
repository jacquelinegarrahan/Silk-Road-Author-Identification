				I placed an order for the ketamine sample. He seems to be a good guy after reading some of his posts so I decided I&#039;d give him a shot. I&#039;ll be sure to post a review for you guys when it gets here.&nbsp; 8)

				Ordered 5 hits of LSD. I fucked up while ordering it, but Llama Socks was super helpful and got everything straightened out quickly. Any delay was definitely my fault. Arrived in about 10 days, decent speed considering distance. Stealth was good, no complaints. Took me a week or so before I had the opportunity to try it. Had 5 hits to split between my girlfriend and I, and since I weigh nearly twice as much and she&#039;s super receptive to hallucinogens, I went with three and gave her two. It was the fastest acting acid I&#039;ve ever eaten, though environment probably counts some for that. Within 20 minutes I was feeling it, and within an hour I was tripping solidly. Nature was majestic and the music was phenomenal. I began to peak about 2-3 hours in, and had the most mind-shattering sex I&#039;ve ever had for a couple hours. Can&#039;t wait for you to list more LSD, bro. 5/5
