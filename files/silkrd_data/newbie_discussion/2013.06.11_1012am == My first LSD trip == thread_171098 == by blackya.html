				I have heard LSD is normally tasteless but this one had a light sour taste. Is it normal?<br /><br />My first LSD experience:<br />So I was alone and no sitter. It was 13:00 on the clock when I took this one blotter of 115 mcg.&nbsp; 40 minutes later the first effects came. It was really cool at the beginning, nice visuals, good mood, feeling really high, no strange thoughts. After a while I felt that my flat starts to be too small for my me, so I decided to go for a walk and to find a place outside where I could be in the nature with trees around and hopefully no people. During my 2 hours walk outside I did not find a place where I would be alone. My mood became also very negative. There were people everywhere and it was annoying and depressing, also in those 2 hours walking around I experienced the most awful, controversial, miserable, tragic and crazy thoughts: there have been moments where my Ego was totally lost and I could not explain a simple thing to myself, I could not understand why people live on earth as well I did not know what I do on this planet in this very moment (now I understand why sitter is needed, especially for the first time&nbsp; ;) ). Sometimes all was again clear and I was just saying to myself that all is fine and that it is just acid which makes me feel this way. I was also very thirsty but I had no guts to buy water, I was sure people would see I am on drugs and as I said earlier I was very confused when I was outside on the street. Finally I reached the railway station, I thought I buy water there. I was really shocked at the railway station: too many people around and walking too close to me and most of them with really weird, ugly and demon-alike looking faces, too many voices, sounds, shops, colours, train announcements, police walking around and so on. I did not like it at all, it was very unpleasant. <br />After it I came back home because I felt tired after walking around for 2 hours. I came home, drank milk, took a shower, started to vomit, felt really lost again. Also inside of me I was again confused and did not know what to do. I wished my trip would be over. Physically it felt rather uncomfortable. <br />But after a while I came down and I started to feel again very good. I had again my good mood back, physically I felt being high. I started to enjoy it again. I also prepared some pasta to eat. <br />At night I felt like I want this trip to be over. Somehow it was enough for the first time, my body was tired and I was tired from those million of thoughts I had in my head. I smoked weed, it felt again very cool and funny. But some hours later I could not stand it any longer and went to bed. Of course there was no chance to fall asleep. As I said before, my body was very tired and begging for sleeping but my mind dominated the whole situation and all I could do was to walk around from one room into another and back and so on. In this way I hoped I could find my peace to fall asleep. <br /><br />So to summarize it: I stayed awake for around 34 hours, I felt like tripping for around 18 hours of which 12-13 hours were really tripping and the rest was this coming down. And the come-down was quite awful, I did not like it, I wished I could have had some benzos to stop it.<br /><br />But generally I liked my first trip, it was nice and interesting experience. I would love to try it again. <br />What I did not like mostly (and this I have written some lines above) was the come-down and sometimes this very unpleasant feeling on the physical level. <br />Today I feel fine but still very tired and a bit confused/lost.<br /><br />I think now I also understand what is meant when people speak about the purity of LSD. Please correct me if I am wrong: It is what one feels on the physical level, some vendor write in their descriptions that the trip is mild and pleasant. <br />As I have said earlier my trip was not always&nbsp; mild and pleasant, sometimes it felt really heavy, terrible and uncomfortable.<br /><br />I would appreciate if u guys share some thoughts and ideas of yours and also if u could give some tips for the future trips of mine&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Thank u<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

				Wow hard trip for this quantity.<br />The point is that LSD maybe can cause you a bad trip, but not this physical and this long. Are you sure it was LSD? Maybe it was DOM? DOM can last much more than LSD.<br /><br />But what it looks to me is that you took LSD in a bad Set&amp;Setting. Remember that the S&amp;S is the most important part of a LSD trip. You have to be in a comfortable environment (I prefer nature) and with good colleagues. Also, you have to be in a good point of your life. For the next time, when the Bad trip comes, I recommend you to go to a quiet place, relax, maybe some meditation, watch the nature and some psychedelic music (Kitaro, Trance, on your like). Usually first time of LSD should be with some good friends who have taken LSD other times and already do in this moment, far from the city or in a green part of it.<br /><br />Next time prepare it better and you will enjoy. Anyway, you&#039;ve also enjoyed this experience and you always learn from experiences like that.<br /><br />

				It seems like you indeed had a rather long and heavy trip. Just a guess, but were it the &#039;Hofmann bicycle&#039; blotters?<br />I heard from other people that they feel a bit &#039;dirty&#039; and they do have a slight soapy/bitter taste from the solvent that is used.<br /><br />And next time try getting basic stuff like water &amp; some fruit before starting your adventure!
