				&nbsp;I&#039;ve noticed that the only benzos i see on SR are klonopin, xanax, and ativan. I&#039;m a big fan of benzo&#039;s and I love triazolam, tamazepam and flunitrazepam&nbsp; to name a few. I&#039;m interested in becoming a vendor and possibly selling those benzos on SR because of the rarity of them on this site. Is it illegal to sell flunitrazepam? I&#039;m only asking because I&#039;ve never seen them and I thought maybe it&#039;s against SR rules because of its stigma as a date rape drug just like selling weapons and stolen CC numbers are illegal because they can be used to harm other people.. Anybody have any input?

If cyanide is inhaled it causes a coma with seizures, apnea, and cardiac arrest, with death following in a matter of minutes. At lower doses, loss of consciousness may be preceded by general weakness, giddiness, headaches, vertigo, confusion, and perceived difficulty in breathing. At the first stages of unconsciousness, breathing is often sufficient or even rapid, although the state of the victim progresses towards a deep coma, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema, and finally cardiac arrest. Skin color goes blue from cyanide-hemoglobin complexes. A fatal dose for humans can be as low as 1.5 mg/kg body weight.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Are there legitimate uses for it that are NOT related to date rape?&nbsp; I think that is the question that should be asked ... and if it DOES have legitimate uses unrelated to rape, then I would assume it would be okay to sell it.&nbsp; Not saying I agree with doing so (because I know there will be people buying for awful purposes), but I think you&#039;re free to list it.&nbsp; Especially since, as someone already pointed out, cyanide is already being sold here.&nbsp; :\

				Other benzos cause extremely lowered inhibitions, amnesia and all those classic &quot;I took waayy too many (insert benzo of choice) last night!&quot; All of these drugs could be used for something as reprehensible as date rape, along with a number of other substances could be also.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had personal experience with Rohypnol myself, but I have used alprazolam, lorazepam, clonazepam and diazepam, with alprazolam being my personal favorite, and I can tell you from firsthand experience it could be used for date rape or other awful acts depending on who is administering it.<br /><br />My point being that I don&#039;t believe something shouldn&#039;t be sold here just because it gained a label as a date rape drug when there are plenty of other substances that could be used toward the same end that are sold openly without that particular stigma attached (at least on SR!)

				Can&#039;t see why it would be for all the reasons listed above. Some of these drugs can be used to do fucked up things. That doesn&#039;t make the drugs themselves inherently fucked up.
