				What came was a light yellow crumbly/flakey powder.&nbsp; I&#039;d mostly smoked white DMT before and had only one experience with yellow stuff. This had turned out to be very weak, and so I was skeptical of the product I&#039;d just received.

				I&#039;d never had the rushing sensation before, or anything at all approaching the body high I&#039;d just experienced.&nbsp; Moreover, the experience was usually 15--20 minutes of visuals followed by 5 or so minutes of a tremulous (but mild) body high.

				*It probably sounds strange that dosing too heavy yields a lower caliber of visual experience with DMT ... but it&#039;s true.&nbsp; I&#039;d noticed before with my beloved white DMT that trying to go for a second hit usually diminished the experience rather than augmenting it.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t ever overdone the dosage to this extent before ... but that was simply because I thought based on the colour this stuff would be weak (racist that I am -_o).

				The point is: it doesn&#039;t matter how small or even legal an individual order is, it NEVER makes sense to transmit personally identifying information unsecurely.&nbsp; Why? Because IF the SR servers were to be accessed by LE, say, then one single instance of an unencrypted address is enough to link your identity to your SR account ... and from there to all the other illegal things you do here.&nbsp; Thus, what nawlins is suggesting defeats the WHOLE POINT of ever encrypting anything.

				This is the end of my narrative.&nbsp; I have purchased some Syrian Rue (legally) and will be trying out Tess&#039;s tabs along side my very first batch of making pharmahuasca next week.&nbsp; Wish me luck.

				GGA I&#039;ve had a bad experience with nawlins too. He is just unreliable and full of bullshit excuses. I paid for an order which never arrived. Then after so many emails he eventually replied to say he will reship half which again never arrived. He then said raise it in the resolution centre and he will refund half which he never did.

				That&#039;s too bad ... but this is why I decided to make this thread.&nbsp; The vendors I had specifically bad experiences with cancelled my orders so I couldn&#039;t even give them the feedback they deserved.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure at least one of them -1&#039;d me for this thread. -_o<br /><br />I had thought this thread was dead, but I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;ve revived it, bolshytrout. In the way of an update, I did try the Tess tabs (and also my first pharma) and wrote up a trip report here (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=130501.msg891717#msg891717).&nbsp; Tess proved out to be an excellent vendor, and I recommend him wholeheartedly.

A buyer even longer and if any of you never had the pleasure of ordering from Pharmville, you truly missed out. Packaging was excellent, product was awesome. I picked up many an Express mail pack worth over a grand so many times I lost count. And they sold so many good painkillers and benzos for cheap. I really miss those days and wish I knew what really happened to them. To me, they were always a class act. Sorry, just reminiscing.

				Great Green Arkleseizure who do you mean by Tess? Tesseract4d(99)? And where did yoiu get the DMT capsules? Having lost my previous DMT supplier (trojan) who had both the DMT and MAOI in capsule form I have been looking for it for ages.<br /><br />As for your trip report, I read it with interest. I must try your technique. I regularly try LSD/oral DMT/and Hash trip. A good combination which gives me about 10 hours of a strong spiritual experience goes as follows: Take few LSD tabs (300 to 500 mics), half an hour later take the MAOI (Syrian rue, 5 gms) and then half an hour later take the DMT brew (15gms of the powder brewed 3 times). Before the trip I make about 10 Hash/Skunk mixed joints ready too to smoke at regular intervals. OMG what trips I get!!! Honestly GGA I can literally play with the stars in the sky. <br /><br />But honestly though if you know a good source for DMT/MAOI capsules plz share.

				No GGA I didnt mean 15gm of DMT but the root bark from which you get DMT. The traditional way of making ayahuasca. But what you say is interesting. do you mean you can also take the DMT crystals orally? (with the syrian rue). I didnt know that. Should I go for any particular kind of crystals?

				Hey Great Green Arkleseizure,<br /><br />I like Tesselated&#039;s blotter, seems very clean. But, wouldn&#039;t you say they are a bit weak?&nbsp; Advertised as 200 mics.? You think?

				@bolshytrout: I recommend the purest DMT your can find.&nbsp; I smoke this stuff much more than I take it orally, and pure stuff means you can easily &#039;break through&#039; with 1 hit (which is desirable).&nbsp; Also: using very pure stuff makes it easier to judge how much drug you&#039;re actually taking.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you want to mirror the effect you get from MHRB, maybe you&#039;ll want the yellowest DMT possible (I&#039;m not sure if any of the other extracted alkaloids in MHRB are psychoactive, but I won&#039;t doubt it).&nbsp; In any case, any crystals will do for eating ... just make sure to take your MAOI at least 30 minutes beforehand.<br /><br />@OwsleyStanley25: No.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t find them weak at all.&nbsp; I felt like they might have been under-advertised.&nbsp; I had been worried they might be weak since people had started to say that (after I&#039;d placed my order, of course).&nbsp; But I tripped balls for 16 hours ... they performed like champs for me.&nbsp; Check the trip report I linked a few posts back if you want to know more.
