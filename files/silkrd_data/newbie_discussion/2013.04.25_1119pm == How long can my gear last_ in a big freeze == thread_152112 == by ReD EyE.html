				You don&#039;t need a freezer.&nbsp; Freezers are bad for weed.&nbsp; The trichomes fall of the weed easier.&nbsp; A freezer is good if you plan on making bubblehash with the weed for that reason.&nbsp; Let the weed cure in mason jars.&nbsp; It lasts for years.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a freezer for the hash either.

				Think about biology. Plants have cells. If you freeze a plant, those cells break. That&#039;s why you can&#039;t freeze tomatoes, they get all mushy and gross. I am just speculating but I think the biggest risk to freezing cannabis is that you risk loosing some of the good THC on the container you are storing it.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t tell you a good place to hide your stash but I wouldn&#039;t expose my stuff to super hot or super cold if I could help it, especially if I am just trying to hide it.
