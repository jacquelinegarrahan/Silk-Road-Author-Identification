				Any ideas for a weight loss drug that won&#039;t make me become dependant on it to function or drive me insane?&nbsp; I have had some sucess with phentermine (makes me really moody and eventually paranoid), adderall (too expensive and the same side effects but not nearly as bad), and other stims...but the problems are<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Too expensive for daily use without a prescription<br />2. Make me completely nuts (phentermine, the only affordable option)<br />3. Cause dependency<br /><br />So I know some people use clenbuterol...anyone have experience with that?&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, yeah I know, eat clean, exercise, but it&#039;s really something I haven&#039;t the time or energy to do like I used to be able to.&nbsp; I am lucky if I have time to eat two meals a day and I can exercise, but it&#039;s not like I can devote 2 hours a day to it like I used to.

				&quot;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today (For Immediate Release: July 17, 2012) approved Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) as an addition to a reduced-calorie diet and exercise for chronic weight management.&quot;<br /><br />Topiramate (topamax) is an anti-migraine/seizure medicine that has weight loss as a side effect. <br /><br />

				2 hours a day? <br /><br />Go hard for 45 minutes, eat right and your golden. <br /><br />But have you ever looked into Anavar? Its great for cutting down, but you still need to do some type of exercise. You could run it for up to 8 weeks, but its pricey..best bet is to find a bulk supplier of the powder rather than pills.

				It&#039;s either stimulants like meth, amphetamines or ephedrine/pseudoephedrine... One or two steroids do rip your body too, can&#039;t remember the names of them both... but as mentioned above &quot;Anavar&quot; might be one of them!<br /><br />The &quot;safest&quot; way to go is probably ephedrine mixed with caffeine and Paracetamol (Alvedone)<br />its a real heartracer combo, and you should NOT do hard training if you somehow decide to try it.. normal walking and easy chins/presses etc. low weight, low rep. rest is important to not make your heart collapse if your in bad condition!<br /><br />Before you try any kind of drugs to help in weight loss, i strongly recommend to do normal exercise, eat healthy to get your body ready for it.<br />

				A friend of mine just recently started taking Strattera for ADD as an alternative to the stims like adderral/ritalin.&nbsp; She lost about 20 pounds since she started it and it makes her not hungry.&nbsp; I do not think it is even a controlled substance.&nbsp; Check it out.

				It may be hard to believe (or easy to believe, perspective dependent) but cannabis can help you lose weight by speeding up your metabolism as long as you avoid the munchies. Caffeine has also been proven to help you lose more weight in conjunction with exercise compared to exercise without. <br /><br />Other tips - keep on moving, whether it&#039;s just tapping your feet or fingers every little adds up. <br /><br />Disclaimer: I&#039;m diagnosed anorexic and when i stopped smoking weed i stopped eating completely too :P

				Not sure if it does bc I think it is fairly new, but I am not positive, hopefully you have insurance.<br />I myself have used both phentermine and adderral for weight loss.&nbsp; Personally I like the the energy they both give me.&nbsp; I build up a tolerance to the phen really quick though so I take it for only weeks at a time.&nbsp; Have you tried the tenuate with the phentermine?&nbsp; I ordered both about a month ago on the road and have lost about 15.&nbsp; The only thing is when I stop taking it it seems to creep right back.&nbsp; I am going on vacation in a few weeks and have to wear a bathing suit or else I would not even bother....

				That sucks, adderral can do that to me that&#039;s why I don&#039;t really take it for more than a day or two.&nbsp; Phen works like that for me maybe the first week or two, but even with taking 2 or even 3 of the 37.5s I start getting my appetite back.

				It was one half of Phen-Fen, the other medicine was fenfluxomine or something like that.&nbsp; Phentermine is relatively safe when used alone in correct dosages but doctors usually only prescribe for 3 months max. And for people who are considered obese.
