				If you are a safe guy, you should try a trip at 600/800ug, but a normal user will take 1 trip at 1000ug :)

				I have some experience myself, am coming off a 4mg or 4 1000ug blotter trip atm. DO NOT do more then 1 your first time by any means. Righteous is a great vendor so good move there, it will be clean and dead on with dosing, and in case you haven&#039;t already read, holding the blotter between your gums and lip is the best, do not swallow spit for as long as possible. I generally hold my spit a half hour and swallow the tabs at an hour to ensure i didnt miss a single drop.<br /><br />&nbsp;A majority of the hospitalizations appear to be insulating the powder form of it, which from a medical and personal standpoint is a very bad idea. This RC is very sensitive to dosing, as to say 1 mg can mean the difference of a great trip and a horrible one. Start slow, always use blotters and build up to higher trips. <br /><br />Vasioconstriction is directly related to dose and trust me you will feel it while tripping, personally my inner thighs are the worst as being major arteries. Not to scare you though, i love this stuff. You will probably find yourself wanting to go on that trip again in the next day or two, this is not recommended as you will need to double or triple the dose to reach the desired effects, wasting it and risking taking it too far. Stay smart and NEVER EVER EVER resell this saying its Acid/LSD. Its rude, a blatant lie and can put the user in a very dangerous situation if they do end up requiring medical attention, which they shouldent, but no risk should be taken. As with any RC, and as i said before, Take it slow, work up to higher doses, and dont be afraid to use half tabs. Marijuana is this guys best friend and can considerably lengthen and speed up the trip without overpowering it<br /><br />I still remember my first trip, used a half tab, half an hour later used the rest when i found myself sadly sober, and 2 hours later i was entirely convinced my computer was about to suck me into the digital world. Plus i felt the strange need to dump my girl, thankfully she went to bed so i could sober up and realize i was just tripping out&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Be careful but dont be scared, and please report back on your trip as i love to hear more on fellow users. I find it quite physically draining but there are too many factors to tell if that is the NBOMe or just the lack if sleep that generally follows a trip. Good Luck!

				Only had one experience with 25i and it was mediocre. The typical psychedelic comeup anxiety was pretty much all I felt apart from minor visuals. It was a smaller dose though. I imagine that higher doses are similar to LSD except you dont get the mindfuck and the spiritual revelations, crazy thought patterns and all that

				i bought some from a vendor on here and it wasnt all that great i had 1000UG didnt feel it too good either . but you should do some research bluelight.ru has some good stuff on it if you can get the real deal be careful i read someone died from 15 1000UG hits and with real LSD you dont have that problem not to mention this stuff was synth in 2006 and has very little scientific research outside the underground. not too mention who knows the side effects . but to each his own. if it were me though i wouldnt try n pass it off as acid as ppl will know they got burned if they know the diff.

				Most of the people I know who have tried it can&#039;t tell it apart from LSD.&nbsp; I re-sell it and have done it a couple dozen times so I can definitely tell the difference.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot &quot;easier&quot; of a trip than LSD.&nbsp; Good for beginners.&nbsp; The visuals tend to be really nice too, swirling patterns and bright colors and all.&nbsp; Personally I like the tyler tabs at 1200 ug, and everyone who tries them loves em.&nbsp; I&#039;d say start with one or two, but I&#039;ve taken 6 at a time, and I know a few people who do like ten at once.&nbsp; I don&#039;t reccomend that though, these are pretty bitter, but one or two isn&#039;t bad at all

				Nickname is NBOMB but Ive tried it and its not that great, I would highly suggest going with lsd, better all around drug and no weird after effects.&nbsp; Lsd is much safer and has been around longer.

				I got 25 1000ug tabs from righteous and the first time, I did one tab. I experienced happiness bordering on euphoria at times, uncontrollable smiling, some jitters, and a tight feeling in my jaw. It was a good time in general and I enjoyed myself very much, especially being with friends who had also taken it. I didn&#039;t get visuals, though. However, the next time I took it, I did one tab plus a quarter tab (1250ug) and got everything from the first time plus some lovely visuals. I&#039;d recommend starting with one tab and increasing or decreasing your dose by very small increments. I did smoke a small amount of decent weed about 30 minutes before putting the tab in my mouth, which helped a lot with the come-up and the vasoconstriction that 25i can cause. I&#039;d suggest doing that if possible, and trying to time it so that the weed high wears off as you come up on 25i.
