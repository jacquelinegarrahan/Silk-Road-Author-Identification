				I&#039;m trying to set up my bitcoin wallet and im trying to test it out before i send any actual cash to it. its my first wallet so i cant just transfer from another account. what im asking for is the smallest fraction of a bc that you can possibly send, what ever fraction of a penny that may be. I&#039;ll be sending that fraction of a penny back to you to i can see how the sending process works as well. <br /><br />df81ee134bcd8e2c376e508d4a9f778228181b6710500327e5d8ddfa0a1f3a736d14660401f8b2ac9cff82de8d05549f10385b5397a35b945ab79394206eed6f<br /><br />I think thats my wallet number

				Ok that looks better, if that&#039;s showing up in your receive tab it will work. I was nervous the first time too but it does work, it just might take an hour or so to get there.

				Sounds good! That&#039;s basically the same reason I&#039;m here. And wow, yes, the weed, it is very strong. I still can&#039;t believe it. I can&#039;t get more than one good toke off what I got and I&#039;m on cloud 9 for hours. With the sativa dominant ones I&#039;ve found more is not always better, for me at least too much gets me kind of panicky.
