				Do lots of yoga, running,eat mainly veggies,drink kombucha, do not consume drugs or alcohol of any kind. <br />Abstain from sex or masterbation for one month. This will purge you of all the crap internally,externally.<br />This works. I know. Ive been there. Was in and out of psyche wards for years, ptsd, been on all sorts of <br />Antidepressants, antipsychotics. They are all bad, trust me. Big pharma does not care about your welfare.<br />Seek vedic/chinese medicine, eschew western dogma/lies. You will find bliss. After one month of this you may be ready to take LSD. by then it will have meaning, and you will be physically,mentally,emotionally,spiritually prepared to understand its&#039; teachings. If you take acid now, it might not have meaning, just a sensory overload,cause confusion. At worst, it could cause further traumas, send you into deeper depression.<br />Om shanti om!

				Psychedelics are absolutely amazing and are nothing to be afraid of. Its not like how the media portrays it at all. They simply make you see the world in a new and unique way... That being said, if you have mental health issues it really wouldn&#039;t be the best time to trip as the effect is just too variable. It could cure your depression or make it worse. In an ideal world these compounds would be used in a medical setting with psychotherapists to overcome severe mental health issues, but alas this is not an ideal world.<br /><br />SSRIs and antipsychotics will pretty much render these compounds inactive anyways so there is no point in tripping while on these medications.

				I love you guys lol <br /><br />I never shut up about acid when I talk to people about it. I can go on and on forever about all the great things acid has taught me. <br /><br />I always tell people to do it at least once but of course, they&#039;re too afraid to. The media has made acid seem like such a horrible thing when it&#039;s not even a drug you take to get &quot;fucked up&quot; on. <br /><br />Every trip on acid has been a new chapter in this book of mine. I learn so much about who I am, the people around me, and just my surroundings in general.<br /><br />And whoops, there I go ranting about acid again.... lol<br /><br />But seriously, ACID IS THE BEST &lt;3333

My friend experienced his death through his dead grandfathers eyes which was just a fraction of it. He even destroyed the mushrooms me and him were growing.&nbsp; It has scarred him horribly. He does fine with mushrooms but not acid. He has done them multiple times. I was there when he had his experience and it hurt me almost as much as him i could see it in his eyes I watched everything he felt. I know I never want anyone to experience what he felt it was horrible. I will never trip with him again ever. doesn&#039;t matter what it is.&nbsp; I feel really mentally stable and know i can handle any experience that is thrown at me.

				Favorite dosages anyone?<br /><br />I have only had one 200ug experience and it was not necessarily underwhelming but I didn&#039;t get as &quot;lost&quot; as I had anticipated or as I would have liked. <br /><br />It was very refreshing, ate some quality Chinese food, walked through my &quot;hip&quot; college town to the lake and watched the sunset with the girl I love. It is too bad I don&#039;t think she understands the level at which I adore her. It is even more depressing for me that now is not an appropriate time to share my feelings with her. I think she has picked up on some hints, and the fact that she is down to trip with me makes me the happiest motherfucker ever.<br /><br />For me being an existentialist she has done a great job of convincing me that somehow somewhere in the universe some things really are meant to be. These are scary thoughts to have for someone like myself with rather developed notions of this world. Since she is also of the same mindset I hope a stronger trip in the future can open her eyes to just how ridiculous my love for her is.<br /><br />Back on topic, what are your favorite LSD dosages? <br /><br />Bonus points if you can compare them to psilocybin mushrooms. (I have had 1/2 gram, 1 gram, 2 gram, 3.5 gram, 5 gram, and 8 gram experiences.

A lot of people say that LSD gives you more visuals than mushrooms but in my case this is not true I took just 4 grams of some ecuadorian speciese that I had grown in my college dorm room and the floor turned into a temple with hyrogriphics. the floor melded with the cieling and my visual plane became one. I have never tried mushrooms since really like 25i tho!!

It is too bad I don&#039;t think she understands the level at which I adore her. It is even more depressing for me that now is not an appropriate time to share my feelings with her. I think she has picked up on some hints, and the fact that she is down to trip with me makes me the happiest motherfucker ever.<br /><br />For me being an existentialist she has done a great job of convincing me that somehow somewhere in the universe some things really are meant to be. These are scary thoughts to have for someone like myself with rather developed notions of this world. Since she is also of the same mindset I hope a stronger trip in the future can open her eyes to just how ridiculous my love for her is.<br /><br />Back on topic, what are your favorite LSD dosages? <br /><br />Bonus points if you can compare them to psilocybin mushrooms. (I have had 1/2 gram, 1 gram, 2 gram, 3.5 gram, 5 gram, and 8 gram experiences. As well as several days of just eating handfuls without weighing.)<br /><br />Even more bonus points if you care to share your opinions on the similarities and differences between LSD-25 and Psilocybin.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Ok mushrooms are really dissotiative in my opinion i dont really like them. A lot of people say that LSD gives you more visuals than mushrooms but in my case this is not true I took just 4 grams of some ecuadorian speciese that I had grown in my college dorm room and the floor turned into a temple with hyrogriphics. the floor melded with the cieling and my visual plane became one. I have never tried mushrooms since really like 25i tho!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Yeah my last and first shroom experience was good and bad. Physically it was unpleasant, felt like my heart was racing....but i somehow was able to blot that out and dancing helped. But the cev&#039;s were very colorful, much more intense than acid. The open eyed stuff was almost non-existent. Things took on a glossy look,that was it really.<br />But i ate only a 1/16 so perhaps thats why.

Do it! Drink from the fountain of knowledge.

Idk some people are really sensitive to it.&nbsp; I dont think everyone should do it unless they have the right mindset.&nbsp; You should treat it with the upmost respect.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well I think everyone is never the same after doing acid. I am much more mindful of beauty and notice <br />Subtle etchings,patterns ...I even see energy all around me. When I meditate I get very intricate cev&#039;s that I didnot have before. Some of this is experience; someof it is the door that acid opened. <br /><br />So...perhaps your friend has not let go, accepted the changes as a positive awakening. Or perhaps he is traumatized. I find that the ones who tend to freak out or have bad trips are people who are very structured,must have control at all times. For them acid could be very harmful. I have a friend who works for IBM, he&#039;s so stuck in his 1-dimensional existence, punch clock in out type, eats exactly three meals at exact times, if he&#039;s just slightly late to an appointment he gets very tense and slams the dashboard, always worried about money when he has <br />A nice car,house,decent income. These types of people should not take LSD- they could not handle it. Sadly, these types of lost souls make up for a very large percentage of the US pop. Especially your. Corporate/business types who are ruled by schedules,deadlines,and the chase for the almighty dollar. <br />the happiest people I meet are artists,musicians,and anyone in the creative mind arts. Many of them have done acid or will at some point. <br />Its sad, because the ones who could likely benefit most from LSD wil not be able to drop their stigmas,baggage,fears unless LSD got a FDA approval rating.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Really enjoyed your reply and I agree with your point about the people that would benefit the most from it never will. My friend experienced his death through his dead grandfathers eyes which was just a fraction of it. He even destroyed the mushrooms me and him were growing.&nbsp; It has scarred him horribly. He does fine with mushrooms but not acid. He has done them multiple times. I was there when he had his experience and it hurt me almost as much as him i could see it in his eyes I watched everything he felt. I know I never want anyone to experience what he felt it was horrible. I will never trip with him again ever. doesn&#039;t matter what it is.&nbsp; I feel really mentally stable and know i can handle any experience that is thrown at me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks. It sounds like what your friend experienced could have been healing. I mean I don&#039;t believe in a &quot;bad trip&quot; per se. I think how won responds to the trip can make it seem bad or unpleasant. But a trip by itself is not bad, its just a state of awareness; good or bad is an interpretation of what you are aware of. But I can see how seeing your own death through the eyes of an already deceased family member could be very traumatic. He should work this trip out with a therapist, interpret and meditate on it. He has to come to grips with this inner fears...<br />
