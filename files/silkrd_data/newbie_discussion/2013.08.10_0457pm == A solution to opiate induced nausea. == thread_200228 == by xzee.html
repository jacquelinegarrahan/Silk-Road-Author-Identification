				&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello everyone. This is my first post and I am new to the forum. I wanted to contribute what I know from experience and add to the discussion. I have used many opiates on and off over the past 13 years with H being the most used. I have only ever done H via IV and I find other methods very hard to do. As I got older I got more responsible with my use and trying to maintain functionality so I did it a couple days here, a couple days there...etc. Everytime I did it I wouldn&#039;t have a tolerance built up and I would throwup and it sucked. I had to carry a plastic bag in my car in case I had to puke while I was driving. I tried different pharmaceuticals, ginger, or anything I could get my hands on but nothing ever worked. The I stumbled upon a website about morning sickness and boom!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The solution is half of a unisom and a vitamin b6 tablet. It is known as the P/D mix Pyridoxine/doxylamine. If you get the unisom or the generic store version make sure it says &quot;Doxylamine succinate&quot; as the active ingredient. You need atleast 10mg of each. Make sure your b6 source is at least 10mg. It has to be taken atleast 30-45 mins before you get your nod on. This is coming from an IV perspective but you should be cautious anyway about building enough up in your blood before the opiate does. I have found that if I take it right when I use or a little after it won&#039;t work at all no matter how much I take after. This tells me that it binds to opiate receptors and blocks other opiates.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any questions! I have been through a lot including methadone kicks and I am a survivor of the naltrexone kick.
