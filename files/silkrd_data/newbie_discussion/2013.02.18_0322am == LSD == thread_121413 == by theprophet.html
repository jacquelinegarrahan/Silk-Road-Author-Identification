				Since this is the newbie section, I am not sure really what to expect as far as answers go but here goes nothing.&nbsp; I am looking for LSD the best on SR.&nbsp; If it came from the USA that would be preferred.&nbsp; I have ordered from Lucydrop and was disappointed, I ended up dropping 3 tabs and feeling almost nothing (strange head space and minor visuals definitely not 100 micrograms per tab).&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyways who do you guys think is the best LSD vendor on the road?

				Though I&#039;ve never ordered from him yet, albionessentialols seems to be the most legit and trusted seller.&nbsp; Jerseycow also seems to have good shit.&nbsp; I recently ordered from Tessellated but have not been able to try them out yet....he does have fast and discreet shipping though.&nbsp; A lot of people will say 3jane but the 50 hits I ordered from her were a waste of money.&nbsp; They made me trip but it deff was not what an acid trip should feel like....upon research it seemed they were a dox.&nbsp; By saying that I know a lot of people will yell at their computers &quot;BUT SHES THE MOST RESPECTED!&quot; but i don&#039;t trust that vendor will avoid at all costs. my .02 btc

				I&#039;ve ordered twice from LucyDrop. I&#039;ve only tested one of the shipments and I was more than pleased with it. It seems there may be some issue with uneven batches, but I haven&#039;t personally experienced it and have only read a few people complaining compared to a whole lot more, myself included, who were more than happy with what has been received. 1.25 tabs (well, more like 1 and 1/3rd) had some visuals (color changes/warping, texture morphing, space distortion), a REALLY good headspace, nice body energy, and an expansion of consciousness. I haven&#039;t tried any from the second batch received (what&#039;s a man to do, eat tabs all day long?) but plan on testing those next. For me it was exactly what I would expect from a tab at that price-range. Sure it&#039;s not 200-300 ug but it&#039;s not priced that way or marketed that way. Without any real lab-tests run by people receiving them there is no definitive way for either us buyers or LD to know without a doubt that there is a issue with ug distribution. I&#039;m tempted to find a mail-in lab, but then I&#039;d have to sacrifice a few tabs and then there is the question of degradation in shipment, etc. For the batch I got I would think 2 would be a decent visual trip and 3-4 would start to get into heavy mindfuck zones. The 1.25 I had left me tripping for a solid 12-14 hours, warm afterglow, was doing yoga stretching half the day, good times had by all.<br /><br />I was even going to order a third round but his page was down for a while due to some SR glitch involving vendors going into vacation mode or something, I&#039;m so non-technical that it all means nothing to me. Anyway, I enjoyed the experience on LD&#039;s tabs and while it&#039;s just my opinion I do not think LD would purposefully or knowingly distribute tabs of a low dosage or of uneven distribution. If anything it could be related more to his source, but I think I caught rumor of production moving in-house to off-set these very risks, but I can&#039;t confirm anything as I&#039;m just a know-nothing tab-eater. I think he&#039;s a little swamped with orders/messages, but was kind enough to respond to me for my first order and in such a way that I fully believe he believes in the product, which for an L vendor means that any issues will eventually be worked out. Unless you&#039;re Tony76, but he was the kind of doctor that didn&#039;t take his own medicine, which doesn&#039;t rank high in my book.<br /><br />Which is just to say, I&#039;ve had such success with LD that I have no problem investing in a third, fourth, or fifth order in the future. In the meantime I&#039;m waiting for another molecule to float in off the breeze but until then I&#039;m totally satisfied with what I&#039;ve received. <br /><br />If you have questions I&#039;d check out the Rumor Mill and spend some quality time reading through the LSD Avengers thread. I placed a small order with Tessallated just to see, I like to keep 2-3 good lines open in case one falls away from SR and also just to see the difference in quality, shipment methods, customer interaction, etc. <br /><br />Anyway, yeah, read through the Avengers, there tends to be a LOT of discussion going on in that thread regarding what&#039;s going on in the here and now. It&#039;s the first place people go to talk about anything and it&#039;s pretty accurate. I only wish the crowd here at SR was a little more forgiving as it seems like a vendor can be totally shit on for small discrepancies. One or two orders out of thousands that aren&#039;t perfect and you better believe that those will be the one or two most vocal people out of the group. I mean there are a lot of people on SR that aren&#039;t on the forums and it usually takes a pissed off person to register, get their post count up, and then pop into a review forum to poo on someone. Singing someone&#039;s praises? Most people are less likely to even think to do that except if they are repeat customers, exceptionally pleased, nice people, or just have time to kill getting their post count high enough. <br /><br />Keep on keeping on.

				check the forum page: &quot;LSD Avengers&quot;,<br />those guys lab-test every LSD that&#039;s sent to them. <br />So if you do make the effort to go threw the post you&#039;ll definitely know where to get your stuff.<br />Then you just need to cross-reference with the forum page on specific sellers and&nbsp; you&#039;ll soon know who has the good stuff and is playing a fair game. <br /><br />Good luck with it!

				Had great experiences with Albion and Jesosofrave. I think if you&#039;re ordering from the US, JoR may be a better idea seeing as it originates from the UK. Happy hunting

				If you are trying to get the most ug for your dollar then JerseyCow would be your best bet. He has Tabs that are lab tested at around 172 micrograms and he is selling a sheet for $600. That is a damn good deal.

				If you had a problem with Lucydrop I advise you to contact him. I had a problem and while he has yet to respond, he has stated (in the avengers thread) that he will be making sure those that got the weak tabs are compensated, and to please give him time. Also the Avengers just moved him to the &quot;Bad Vendors&quot; section, but if he makes amends like he says he will I expect him to be put back up to the &quot;OK Vendors section&quot; I am excited to see what JOR does soon and hope I&#039;m able to get my hands on some!
