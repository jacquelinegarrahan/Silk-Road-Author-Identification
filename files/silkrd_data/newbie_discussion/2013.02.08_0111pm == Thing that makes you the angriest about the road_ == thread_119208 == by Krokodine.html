				Mine is selective scamming.. basically ive had an account here for a long time and had placed like 6 bulk orders, and all was fine until my latest 3 orders, from 2 different vendors (the reputable ones apparently) <br /><br />I ordered bulk from them and the product never showed on all 3 times, and now they are saying I&#039;m trying to scam them or some shit I still got refunded 50% each time so the vendors still gained. Wont say who it is here, but if you read their review threads youll see me on my old account going ape shit!<br /><br />My buyer stats went to 9/3. 3 refunds from 9 orders. So now vendors dont want to do business with me so ive had to make a new SR account and a new forum account. <br /><br />anyway it&#039;s in the past, and im back ready to have some fun. need to get some bulk molly quickly though, and event is coming up where i would be able to get rid of 50+ grams in a couple of hours, my eyes are going $.$ thinking about it!!<br /><br />i wouldnt change sr for the world though love this place&nbsp; :-* :-*<br /><br />what annoys you about the road?

				I agree with Simplemachines... you should name names.&nbsp; You&#039;re not going to order from them again... like what are they going to do to you?<br /><br />The community deserves to know.<br /><br />To answer the original question: what everyone said already sounds befitting...&nbsp; But if I can add to the list, I&#039;d say liars.&nbsp; Liars posting completely false info in order to hurt SR, hurt rival vendors... or&nbsp; just trying to be a scumbag salesman.&nbsp; And/or are maybe just truly ignorant about what they&#039;re talking about, i.e. giving bad advice.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It doesn&#039;t really make me too angry, just slightly annoyed:<br />when you&#039;re searching for an item, the system searches listing titles AND the body of the listing. So sometimes you get results that are completely irrelevant because a word appears in the body content. I guess an option for being able to search title only, body only, or both.

				Ah, yes.&nbsp; The 50-post rule, otherwise known as the bane of my existence, lately.&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; In fact, I wouldn&#039;t even be talking about it right now if I weren&#039;t trying to hit the 50-post mark.&nbsp; Oh, and for the last hour I&#039;ve been trying to load SR to leave feedback, but it&#039;s not happening.&nbsp; That kinda sucks.&nbsp; The vendors, though, from what I&#039;ve gathered so far, mostly don&#039;t suck.&nbsp; I did a stupid thing on this one order and forgot to click on the right shipping option, but I worked the order so that the number of pills equaled almost exactly the cash I had in my account.&nbsp; So, the vendor messaged me and was like, &quot;hey dude, you forgot to do shipping, here&#039;s the link.&quot;&nbsp; And, I was like, &quot;dude, I am so fucking sorry, but can we drop the order by one pill and use that to pay for shipping?&quot;&nbsp; And he was like, &quot;No.&nbsp; Welcome to Silk Road, dude.&nbsp; Shipping&#039;s on me.&quot;<br /><br />Vendors like that is why SR works as well as it does.

				One of the coolest things about SR is how little anyone is talking about it on the WWW.&nbsp; I mean, type &quot;Silk Road&quot; in a FB search window, and what do you get?&nbsp; Jack shit!&nbsp; Google it, and you&#039;ll get a relevant hit or two, but by and large SR runs under the radar.&nbsp; In that sense, maybe we *are* living in a dream world, GQ.&nbsp; In fact, maybe this, maybe this might be... the matrix.

				Just the fact that posts are 50. Amongst other minor things. The post should be like 30 or so. 50 is way too much. Other then that the speed issues also but like it was mentioned earlier it&#039;s something we have to deal with. There should be a scammer ban list somewhere too!

				What pisses me off is how much the site is geared to protect sellers. But newbies are screwed in so many ways- either vendors wont sell to u,&nbsp; cancel orders for no reason, or selectively scam.&nbsp; &nbsp;And even if u get a refund, your stats look like shit. why not make feedback for buyers too?&nbsp; like ebay.&nbsp; people can then see why buyers had orders cancelled or refunded.&nbsp; just putting a number or percentage can look bad sometimes.&nbsp; <br /><br />And even when u get a refund, you usually get back less bitcoins cuz btc is constantly going up in value. hedged orders make sense, but shouldnt apply to orders placed in less than 12 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;people say be happy to get a refund, but the whole point of doing all the legwork to buy btc is to spend them on SR.&nbsp; but getting back less than u sent still sucks.&nbsp; My btc was tied up for 3 weeks cuz a bad vendor didnt ship anything &amp; i had to submit a resolution for a refund.&nbsp; then i get a refund, but i get back less btc.&nbsp; why?&nbsp; the seller admits he didnt ship anything. why shouldnt i get back all the btc i sent him?&nbsp; yes if btc had dropped in value i may have been protected, but the seller should give me back exactly what i sent if i prove i did no wrong.&nbsp; the fact that btc rose in price should be HIS punishment for lying &amp; trying to scam me.<br /><br />Also if a seller is having alot of complaints against him, why doesnt SR do something right away?&nbsp; take Cimicon for example- just look at all the problems people are having with him.&nbsp; yet he continues to list &amp; make money.&nbsp; doesnt make sense.<br />

For example, Netherlands would be red. Especially being mailed into the US. With more successful packaging, the countries change color to yellow with mixed-results, and green for more successful transactions than not.. You can also see a percentage rate of&nbsp; successful , and failed packages (but not attempted, lest police try to use that for statistical analysis. <br /><br />So if there was a crackdown on mail from say, canada or from the netherlands in germany, and france, those countries would have an alert, and become red&nbsp; to show&nbsp; the danger in shipping in (but shipping out is fine, as orders coming from germany and/or france would still be marked as successful. <br /><br />Impolite vendors, or vendors who demand 5/5 rating, purely because they threaten to blacklist you if you don&#039;t.

				I&#039;m thrilled that something like SR exists, believe me. Like everyone else though I hate how slow TOR is and I hate the scammers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been scammed twice. Once wasn&#039;t really my fault as they were a trusted seller that went under recently after I placed my order. The other I really could have looked into better and it was a stupid purchase. Either way, it makes me more mad than being screwed over &quot;in real life&quot; because we&#039;re all here participating in something that a lot of society frowns upon and I suppose I feel there should be some sense of brotherhood. I hate when people take advantage of that. We are all in this together.<br /><br />Now I wish I could just get to 50 posts so I could post on the rumor mill about the potential that I&#039;m getting screwed over a third time...

				I love SR too !<br /><br />But there is still a few thing quite annoying:<br /><br />1) You can&#039;t sort by price or display $/g or something similar.<br />2) The 50 post limit for newbies. (Which encourages people to spam like hell...)<br />3) The feedback system : Rating could be improve + the current system is NOT used as it should. Marks below 5 are seen as insults...<br /><br />Well and of course.... SCAMMERS -_-

				Well it could be a nice time to stop mining.<br /><br />ASIC devices are going to be shipped pretty soon. And their performance is like 10X better than most CG miner could do.<br /><br />The problem is that by the time you get you Butterfly lab device, most people would have already settled and started to get a lot of BTC. Also the difficulty will soon increase making it harder to win much money from mining.<br /><br />I&#039;m really tempted by the Jalapeno 150$ ASIC... but not sure it would let me win anything.

				I haven&#039;t found any issues with the road itself aside from the unannounced downtime. <br /><br />However, the process of tumbling/transferring coins to different accounts is quite frustrating.&nbsp; You can never transfer out the exact amount you transferred in and are always required to leave .005 bitcoins behind.&nbsp; Doing that 3 times is quite frustrating.&nbsp;

Lame as shit. Another example is trying to get a product here by this weekend. So I did my research on vendors that ship fast 2-3 days, got funds into my account by Wednesday morning, but then then the site went down for me for like 5 hours so I wasn&#039;t able to put my order in until that night. So my order didn&#039;t get processed/shipped until the next day so it probably won&#039;t get here until after this weekend. Newb mistake though should have realized Silk Road usually takes forever and should have placed my order well in advance.<br /><br />Most of the complaints I read on here (including my own) was due to user error. So we should learn how to use the SR properly before putting in your orders and do your research so you don&#039;t get scammed. Large orders seem like a horrible idea. Even if you don&#039;t get scammed by the vendor, there is a larger risk of your package being discovered and never arriving.
