				I really didn&#039;t have an expectation about the sort of people I was going to meet here in the SR forums. Sure there are the haters, the scammers etc. However mostly I have encountered intelligent, articulate and helpful people.&nbsp; What sort of people were you expecting? What sort of people have you encountered?

				Internet people.<br /><br /><br />Not a real answer? I expected to find intelligent people. Anarchists and &quot;sane&quot; druggies. Hopefully there are loads of psychonauts here as well :D

				People who actually know about the internet, security, encryption etv and people who know their drugs- not just teenage glue sniffers :) So far, I like what I see, or rather, read.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I expected to find people from all walks of life from all over the world ! There are all sorts here, some who can&#039;t spell, some very articulate, some wired and angry, some mellow and happy. Many quite nice people and some extremely intelligent and knowledgable folks. I enjoy the sarcasm and wit seen here. There are some very, very helpful Full and Hero Members and Moderators who out of the kindness of their hearts freely give of their knowledge to help newbies. I am astounded at the depth of knowledge here, and truly, though it was challenging, I really enjoyed learning encryption, in retrospect that is. There are some extremely crude and foul mouthed people here, but I just remember it takes all kinds to run a free enterprise, especially when it is working outside the confines of rules and laws in whatever country you reside in. And THANK-YOU SR, for existing and making it possible to acquire the medications I want. THANK-YOU to all those who help others, too
