				Hey Everyone :) <br /><br />Firstly I would like to thank everyone on the silkroad/forums for being so kind and generous.<br />I can tell this is a very strong community of dedicated people to what there doing here.&nbsp; <br />Artificial is a very small group of people who want to be be apart of this community, both here and on the road. <br />We&#039;ve been using the service for some time now for the importing of products into Australia, we&#039;ve learned a lot and are still learning. <br /><br />However we feel as we can offer &quot;something more&quot; , a passion , a goal :) <br />Artificial is a group that will be based in Australia and will eventually start shipping domestically, for always a standard price. <br />That means no overpriced product just because we live in a country will strict laws, i&#039;m not paying up to $40 for a tab of LSD that is only worth $20. <br />It&#039;s a rip off and it&#039;s needs to stop and get with the rest of the world. We want to offer quality for the same price as anyone else. <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />Our Doors Will Be Open In Two Months! <br />--------------------------------------------------<br />LSD<br />MDMA / Caps <br />NBOME&#039;s <br />DMT<br />2C-X<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />And anything else we can give to you for a good price :) <br />Maybe in the future we will become big enough to expand OS, but until then we are happy giving the aussies what they want. <br />A price and quality for it :)<br /><br />If you have any questions, please don&#039;t hesitate to ask in the lead up, and we truly hope you enjoy what we have to offer. <br />We would also like to be quite active on the forums because we love drugs, the topic and discussion and helping other people out. <br /><br />-Artificial(Artificial Technology) 2013-

				I&#039;m from AUS too, due to our nanny nation I only buy domestically to decrease the risk of being caught, which ultimately means paying more for products. <br /><br />Hopefully we&#039;ll see you on SR very soon :)<br />
