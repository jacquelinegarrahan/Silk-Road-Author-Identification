				I prefer BitInstant. Seriously, just have to fill out a quick form online. Then just walk up to your local walmart/CVS, fill out another form, and your bitcoins are usually there within two hours. <br /><br />

				1) bitmining costs more in your electricity bill than it does your revenue. And the power usage draws attention to your home.

				Bitcoin-central is terrible...<br />Your account is currently unverified. If you wish to get verified you must submit :<br /><br />A scan of a government-issued photographic identification document (passport, National ID card, driver&#039;s license)<br />Certificate of incorporation for corporate accounts<br />All submitted document scans must be :<br /><br />very clear and legible (low quality scans or photographs of documents will be rejected),<br />scanned in color,<br />unedited, uncensored or altered in any way,<br />unexpired.<br />Please scan both faces of submitted documents when relevant.

				Blockchain.info - throwaway account, fund with cash direct from their web site , generate a payment form, go to wal mart, fill in blue money gram form, pay, voila bitcoin at your address in minutes no hassle.&nbsp; Just keep the info related to your throwaway account the same as you fill in on the blue money form. From there the choice is yours.&nbsp; If you keep large amounts send it into a real not virtual wallet and back it up somewhere safe.
