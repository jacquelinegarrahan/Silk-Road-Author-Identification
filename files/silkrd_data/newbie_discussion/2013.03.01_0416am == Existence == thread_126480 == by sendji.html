				This is a serious question!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;m not a big huge stoner hippy or anything, my mind is really perplexed by this.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine nothing at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet, at the same time, I can&#039;t imagine how anything does exist.&nbsp; Matter had to come from something, but what did it come from if nothing existed?&nbsp; Even if you believe in God, or you don&#039;t, how did God or anything come into existence out of nothing?

				I wish I knew.<br /><br />The only thing I can thing is that it would be impossible for nothing to exist, therefore matter must exist, but as to the intricacies of physics... we&#039;re not even close to figuring out anything significant to some kind of raison d&#039;etre. But does there necessarily have to be a reason for anything? Could it just be that somehow the necessity for matter by it&#039;s own necessity brought with it a mathematical law of physics that dictated all that followed? I don&#039;t tend to ponder it too much, as my fragile little mind cannot possibly begin to comprehend the possibilities.<br /><br />Most philosophy professors will tell you not to think about questions that can&#039;t be answered. That always pissed me off. I think though the reality is probably duller than then question. &#039;Stuff&#039; always has been and always will be. Why? Because it always has been.&nbsp; :P

				@exis :&nbsp; While I can see the viewpoint that physical matter--as we know it--is probably holographic, that still doesn&#039;t explain the reality behind the, &quot;computer simulation,&quot; and how or why that exists.<br /><br />@ objectsmayappear : Thanks for that answer.&nbsp; It helps a lot to just think that it would be impossible for nothing to exist.

				If it didn&#039;t you would never be able to ask the question. So it does. Why? Never to be known. How? Hmm, good question, we got the best minds working on it, but they probably won&#039;t be enough. I do not believe in god or any other supernatural explanations, makes things much harder, but much more interesting (at least for me).&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck, oh wait, luck has nothing to do with it...<br /><br />mushmold

				Whether a creator/supreme being exists, or not, doesn&#039;t impact what I&#039;m perplexed about.&nbsp; It&#039;s about existence in general, with or without belief in a greater power.&nbsp; Just clarifying... :)&nbsp; To put it another way.&nbsp; For spiritual believers, where did God and matter come from?&nbsp; For randomness folks, where did matter come from?&nbsp; <br /><br />*sigh*&nbsp; We will probably never know.

				I don&#039;t know, but reality is definitely only what your brain perceives. I don&#039;t think you or I could ever possibly be seeing things the exact same way. Every object carries a feeling of experience that shapes the way we view it. Everyone sees everything differently, experiences everything differently. Reality is fluid. But this 50 post count is not... ha ha.

				I can certainly relate to the mental brick wall thing. It&#039;s such a strange feeling to really really ponder what it&#039;s like to not exist at all. The mind seems to come up to a void, and eventually goes off in search of more banal things to occupy itself with.

				I freaked myself out when I was about 13 and thinking about life and existence. Hitting a brick wall/void is a perfect description of what I felt when I thought about non existence.

				Some things are just not meant to be understood, the existence of life is far too complex to be solved in any form of hypothesis that we can even attempt to muster with our brains. I just accept that where ever we came from, how ever it all started are here now, that I exist and try to take as much advantage of my situation and the blessings that I have been given while I can and still have a chance.
