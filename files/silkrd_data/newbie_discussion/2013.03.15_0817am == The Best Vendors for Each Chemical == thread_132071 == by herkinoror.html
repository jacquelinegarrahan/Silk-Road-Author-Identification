				I remember on the wiki that there where links to review threads for vendors of the most popular chemicals.&nbsp; Threads where people would rate who was good and who had the best products and the like.&nbsp; Well I can&#039;t find that and it doesn&#039;t matter anyhow cause I couldn&#039;t post in them anywho.&nbsp; So let&#039;s start one that we can post in! :D<br /><br />One of my favourite vendors is hatter26.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had nothing but great experiences ordering from him.&nbsp; His prices are a little high but his Cold Shoot BTH is FANTASTIC!&nbsp; Now mind you I have never had any other kind of Heroin to compare this to but it&#039;s about the right potency and effect and I&#039;m very happy with it.&nbsp; He&#039;s superfast, I almost always recieve my product in less then a weeks time and the stealth shipping is phenomenal!&nbsp; I would like to one day order pure Opana so that I could shoot it up without worry about binders but it is SOFUCKINGEXPENSIVE!&nbsp; Can any one vouch for the difference in potency between it and the pills.&nbsp; The pills on here are pretty cheap.<br /><br />On the opposite front I would say never order from HiroProtagonist unless you are a severe addict.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s his fault but I ordered a whole Gram of his Oxycodone and while it was very well priced so that I don&#039;t feel absolutely raped I am by no means pleased.&nbsp; Me and my GF blew through that with no tolerance in two evenings.&nbsp; It was a very weak product.&nbsp; There was definitely Oxy in it.&nbsp; But it burned terribly.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; You live and you learn.<br /><br />So please post!&nbsp; Any reviews of any product or vendor are welcome!

				I&#039;ve ordered from some other vendors but it was very sporadic and I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable rating any of them or their products as most of them where awhile ago.&nbsp; However I did forget to mention in my original post MrDutchGuy!&nbsp; His Fentanyl is a great and pure product.&nbsp; I got the nasal spray which I IVd and snorted.&nbsp; Good stuff but not for me.&nbsp; However I would direct anyone interested in Fentanyl in his (or one of his resellers {hatter26&nbsp; is one of the lol}) direction.<br /><br />I would be very interested in hearing everyones opinions on Ketamine and 2C-B vendors.&nbsp; Gammagoblin looks good for 2C-B but he has none in stock now.&nbsp; And I have no idea who to get Ketamine from.&nbsp; It seems like all the US sellers have elevated prices.

				LSD: I&#039;d have to say JerseyCow right now. My other favorite L vendors on SR don&#039;t have anything right now.<br />Ketamine: Not my thing but maybe I&#039;ll give it another shot.<br />2-CB: I got a few good caps from Nawlins.&nbsp; It was a tad weak, but still quite enjoyable.<br />Mushrooms: Plentiful and cheap right now. MushroomGirl sent me a fast 1/2 Oz. and the shrooms look wonderful.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t tried yet.<br />

				LSD - Jannis is the man. Always good and clean LSD, super customer service. Be aware that he don&#039;t do business with newbies under a certain amount of transaction<br /><br />BioGrow - Cheap weed but the quality is surprising for the price.<br /><br />MDMA - Powerade have not the cheapest nor the strongest MDMA on the Road but his customer service is really good.

Packaging is not super-stealthy though. Don&#039;t know if 2C-B is a &quot;hard&quot; drug to ship, if dogs can find it or whatever :P&nbsp; Worth the risk IMO. Ships from the EU.

				I&#039;ve also bought some 2c-b from mahakala last summer. It felt like good gear. Even got a bit left. Mahakala seems like a nice guy also. I agree what was said about his shipping though.

				MDMA - CloudSurfer<br /><br />Without a doubt. This is the general consensus among people that know M. He is sporadic with his stock though, and when his listings are up they go pretty much within a day or two<br /><br />2C-B - gammagoblin
