				I&#039;m thinking the Feds will first re-schedule it to II in the next 2 years. It will be legal for recreational use in all the Medical states in 5 years and completely legalized in 7 years.

				I imagine it being nationally legal within 10-20 years. I&#039;m pretty sure there are still some states pretty well against it though, so it may never be legal in every state.

				I think you&#039;re right about 7 years. thats what ive been saying all along. 2 more presidential elections. theres too many states jumping on at this point. theres going to be tax stats and revenue stats coming out in the next few years that are going to be impossible for other states to ignore. I dont thing totally legal or decriminalized is going to happen very soon, but at least medical for every state by 2020!!

				8-16 years...max. Republicans would be wise to take this issue from the Democrats and run with it. I mean, us marijuana users are technically criminals using a schedule I drug, that is pretty terrible and needs to be changed much quicker than the time I assume.

				There&#039;s going to be a battle between states such as Washington and Oregon and the Federal Government. The reason the federal government won&#039;t legalize it is because of the big pharmaceutical companies. They admit it right on whitehouse dot gov. Check this out:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Regardless of state laws to the contrary, there is no such thing as “medical” marijuana under Federal law.&nbsp; Marijuana continues to be a Schedule I substance meaning that it has no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.<br /><br />It is also important to know that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved medical use of isolated components of the marijuana plant such as THC, the active ingredient in marijuana and related synthetic compounds.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And THEN it goes on to list a half dozen or so, by brand name, THC based synthetic drugs from large pharmaceutical companies. It&#039;s basically a sales ad! <br /><br />So it says marijuana is ILLEGAL and has NO accepted medical use, while these garbage synthetically derived patented expensive drugs DO. You see, the FDA is owned by the pharmaceutical companies and companies like Monsanto, which is why the federal government does not want to allow marijuana to have any legitimate use. The states aren&#039;t quite as influenced by the FDA, so they are more willing to decriminalize or even legalize marijuana.<br /><br />Another possibility is that marijuana was involved in some of the CIA mind control research many years ago. Possibly they are reserving its use for some other purpose.

				They&#039;re fast taking steps to ensure a revolt by the people cannot succeed. There will be as many staged / planned incidents as needed to ban firearms completely, so that when the economy collapses, DHHS&#039; 6 billion round stockpile will be much more effective against the people when they cannot return fire.

				&nbsp;In the great O&#039;l USA it will never be legalized until we do something about private prisons. They pay for the drug war because they make bank on pot heads going to jail. After a few generations completely die off I don&#039;t think too many people will care about the use of Marijuana. Hell, in 7 years (Like you guys have been mentioning) they might already be able to completely synthesis all the major health beneficial compounds and then use that as an excuse to never legalize it. I can&#039;t tell the future. I would say thay cannabis would reach an exception rating of about 80% in the nest 40-60 years, once all the old people who we&#039;re brainwashed to hate weed die. No hate for old people. (I love old people) &lt;3

				Its not a wise idea for it to be legalized, that gives corporations free range over the substance, and it will use its medical properties very quickly.<br /><br />Just look what they have done to tobacco, which is a relatively benign substance in its natural form.<br /><br />Decriminalization is the key, and that&#039;s what we must focus on.

				it depends on who is in office. both parties will go after legalized states. the republicans will go HARD. the courts will end up affirming legalization after states. <br /><br />libertarians? no chance in hell. the guy that is going to headline the libertarian candidacy is vocal about being against legalization. what do they get anyway? 4% of the popular vote and 0% of the electoral college? <br /><br />starbucks needs to start slanging fast.

				I&#039;d sure like to see weed legalized within the next ten years. However, I think the issue is too complex to predict an accurate forecast. Medical states, legal states, big pharma agenda, level of cartel violence, etc, etc. And as one poster stated, private prisons. The drug war finances LE and their cages.
