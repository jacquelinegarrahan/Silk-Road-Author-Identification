				This is a thread about everyone&#039;s worst experience with a drug, or what they believe to be the &quot;worst&quot; drug.<br /><br />I would have to say Oxycodone, as i was addicted for about 3 months, and went through 2 weeks of the most painful withdrawal symptoms after i finally kicked it.<br /><br />I vowed never to touch opioids again.<br /><br />

				Alcohol is a bitch.<br /><br />You&#039;re dumb as fuck while drunk, it impairs your motricity, emotional state and judgement, next day grants you with a nasty comedown and withdrawal symptoms are amongst the worse. Oh and it&#039;s highly addictive.

				Bath salts is a general term used for a mixture of various research chemicals mixed with an inert substance and sold in stores and online under the name bath salts (not for human consumption) so they are not selling it as drugs.<br /><br />The media made a big scare about them and said they do this and that and make you eat people and now people are scared of them and there is a big bad mystic about them.&nbsp; Much like reefer madness many decades ago when people thought cannabis was horrible and made you go crazy and kill people.

				Most of the horror stories about bath salts aren&#039;t really related to bath salts at all.&nbsp; That bloke in Florida who chewed a man&#039;s face off, for instance, was just stoned :/<br /><br />I don&#039;t think any drug is particularly bad.&nbsp; Scopolamine, as Jack N Hoff has said, might have the most common response of &quot;NO.&quot;<br /><br />Meth kind of ruined my family, but it&#039;s just another tool.&nbsp; Like Heroin.&nbsp; Like Weed and LSD.&nbsp; Like DMT.<br /><br />Nothing is inherently evil.&nbsp; Abuse of something can lead to evil.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />All that being said, Nicotine is the worst drug.&nbsp; More addictive than heroin AND a pretty shitty high.&nbsp;

				I would have to say Methadone was the worse. I would get a nice nod and buzz while on them, but after 16 months on it then my doc getting in some dea trouble. I was cut off after taking 5 a day..<br /><br />Lets just say, I was sick for 3 months. Thought I was going to DIE! tried to die actually. Didn&#039;t have the balls.<br /><br />Stay away from methadone if you are not using it as a recreational drug.. It will get a hold of you worse then heroin.
