				I could also do for a recommendation on vape pens or cartomizers. I saw a listing for e-juice compatible and one for 510 threaded compatible tips. Does anyone have experience with these ?

				hey adelphi, i&#039;m almost strictly a concentrate smoker, and i&#039;ve ordered off of quite a few people..&nbsp; so far, the best i&#039;ve had was from GaiaGarden, but they don&#039;t regularly stock bho afaik.&nbsp; the best value i&#039;ve ever gotten was ordering the 1/2 oz of honeycomb from norcalconnection for 350, but i don&#039;t see them listing it right now (on SR at least, i believe they&#039;ve got a BMR).&nbsp; it was stuff that i sold EASILY for 50 a g.&nbsp; people thought it was a straight up bargain, and really, it is.<br /><br />right now there&#039;s a LOT of good concentrate on the road, and a LOT of shit.&nbsp; there&#039;s also some really pricey stuff and some stuff that&#039;s more realistic.&nbsp; right now i&#039;d say your best bet is to make an order with SouthernHumboldt, because they&#039;re running a special for newbies at $20/g for 5 g&#039;s.&nbsp; and they have excellent sap and shatter from what i&#039;ve heard, i&#039;m waiting on a pack myself.&nbsp; a lot of people seem to really like just4u2nv, but the super high prices have always kind of made me stay away for whatever reason.&nbsp; i just have never had any concentrate that i would pay 70/g for, not to mention that he only ships first class..&nbsp; <br /><br />so yeah, if you don&#039;t mind letting it sit in processing a little while since they&#039;re clogged with orders atm, go for SouthernHumboldt.&nbsp; if you need it fast and don&#039;t mind paying a little extra, then i would use someone like lexisadie, who has probably the best looking wax on the entire site right now, and a really good reputation for having luxuriously dank shit.&nbsp; i&#039;ve had extracts from thegreenovendoor and was not super impressed by it, as well as from novartis, which was underwhelming as well.&nbsp; scoobydoosmokes47 (i believe) makes great extracts for the price, he was one of the first people i ever ordered from and his stuff is consistently B+ or higher.&nbsp; californiadreams has great crumble wax, whooped my ass super hard last time i ordered some diamond og from him.&nbsp; hashman sent me a really disappointing gram of what was supposed to be violator kush honeycomb but looked more like just a brown splodge.&nbsp; i smoked the whole thing in like a day and got kind of stoned, not a big fan, but that was when he first started out as well.&nbsp; i&#039;ve ordered from others but i&#039;d have to think about more..&nbsp; hope that gives you something to start with..&nbsp; <br /><br />as far as vape pens, i have a cloud-style one that i burn hard as hell and i love using it, especially in public, although the taste is a little plasticky i&#039;ll admit.&nbsp; i&#039;ve never used e-juice extracts or a pre-loaded 510 tip, but i&#039;m sure they&#039;d both work great.&nbsp;

I appreciate it. Do you use the BHO in your vape pen ? Would you recommend the model you got or is it just a generic cloud style ?

				no prob, i know how saturated the market is with these things and with concentrate and it&#039;s incredibly difficult to sort through all the bullshit..&nbsp; the pen i use is the sutra, it&#039;s made by gotvape, and comes with a really good warranty, as well as one chamber with a titanium coil.&nbsp; i smoke oils, wax, shatter, everything out of it, and i go hard on it all day long, but tbh the best vape pen i&#039;ve ever used by far was the vapor bros dabblr.&nbsp; you cant load much more than 3-4 large sized DABS (not hits, these are definitely dabs, this shit would make keith sweat) at once, but it has the easiest loading chamber i&#039;ve ever used, the best flavor, the longest battery life and it doesn&#039;t have an auto-shutoff for how long you hold the atomizing button down because it has a self-regulating temperature-controlling microchip in it (it only gets so hot and beyond that it just stays at that heat, so you don&#039;t burn your dabs).&nbsp; its also like 90 bucks i think, my sutra was 70, and i honestly wish i&#039;d spent the extra 20 bucks after using my friends dabblr.&nbsp; whoops the shit out everything else on the market (besides the omicron, which a friend just bought me but is WAY expensive [$250-ish] and much more difficult to get acclimated to, even though it can hold 1g+ at a time in its tank).&nbsp; vapor bros make a solid product, as well, which if you&#039;ve ever used their box vapes you can attest to, and i honestly feel scared sometimes when i let my friends hit my sutra, cuz it&#039;s fragile, and would NEVER let anyone else handle my omicron due to just how difficult it is to get a good hit off of it, but would have zero problem passing the dabblr around at a party or in the van or anywhere, it&#039;s very intuitive, but if you&#039;re not ready for it that thing can put you on your ass..&nbsp; highly recommended..<br /><br />fuckcombustion is a really good forum to check out.&nbsp; they&#039;re all old-school vapeheads and are really tough on most new products, especially vape pens, so if you want an honest opinion, that&#039;s the place to check.&nbsp; i did a lot of research there before i bought my da buddha, and was glad i did, because no other tabletop vaporizer has gotten me fried like that thing.&nbsp; it puts most of my friends to sleep lolll&nbsp; never used wax or oil in it tho, only shatter once and what a mess...

You are right there is so much info to wade through it&#039;s hard to get caught up on it. Even finding a good forum for info was tough so I will check out fuckcombustion for sure. <br /><br />The Omicron had caught my eye, the idea of a small &quot;tank&quot; of oil always at the ready really piqued my interest. Would the Omicron work in public like how you use your Sutra ? <br /><br />I will check out this dabblr too, I wasn&#039;t familiar with dabbing until I just now did a googling about it. Pretty interesting results it seems ! With the Dabblr is it tough to load with the 3-4 dabs ? Could I load and use it without too much trouble as the passenger in a car for example ?<br /><br />Thanks again for all your help
