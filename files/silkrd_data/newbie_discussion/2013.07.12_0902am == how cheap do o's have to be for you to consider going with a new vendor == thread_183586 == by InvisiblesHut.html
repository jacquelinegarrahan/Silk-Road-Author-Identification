				just thinking out loud while racking up some newbie posts, it seems there are a bunch of well-established cannabis vendors already so what kind of price would it take to get started and noticed?

				it&#039;s not all about the price. i for example don&#039;t mind paying a buck or two more for excellent quality. it&#039;s also the vibe i get from the vendor page. of course you can never tell 100% , but professional vendors who stand behind their product usually put more effort and details into their page and product descriptions.a vendor who is active on the forum is also likely to be recognized more.<br /><br />

Opening almost every single one, then going through feedback, details, and searching them on the forums. I decided to go for the highest quality I can find at a reasonable price, around 250-340. Most of the bud under that price seemed to be outdoor. I contacted them and decided for my first purchase I would only use someone who doesn&#039;t require FE, and someone that gave me a good vibe according to forum reviews/posts and feedback left for them. I choose to go with WeedGirls (oz of sour) / Xinhai (2g caviar) / and NewFavoriteVendor (LSD)<br /><br />I&#039;ll leave a review about them after I receive my orders.

				Thanks for the replies, interesting, presentation is certainly key.&nbsp; Obtaining mmj quality isn&#039;t difficult so it seems that 200-250 range falls into being the low-end pricing of high-grade.&nbsp;

				i agree. i would pay extra $ for better service/support. product of course plays a factor. MDUK (vendor) used to be, in my opinion, one of the top MDMA vendors before he had to go on leave

				we agree with the sentiments in the thread, it is all about quality of product and service.&nbsp; Here at mrhendrix we strive on being timely and punctual with communication and shipping. It goes without saying that we never slack on quality. Have a look at out strong thai&nbsp; weed listings and become a customer and join the family.

Especially UK to USA, your packages are just going to be seized.

				Im a new vendor and i came in with nearer the top end of pricing. I had an advantage that their aren&#039;t many UK based vendors selling top quality weed, but ive had more orders than i can handle.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve got a quality product it sells itself. A couple of people will try you at first then leave good feedback and it will snowball from their.<br /><br />Get some interesting strains in that no one else is selling, people like variety.

				Niice, I love me some Lemon Sour D.&nbsp; I&#039;m up in that Super Lemon Haze atm.&nbsp; Very cool thanks for all the feedback, definitely worth asking do you find Sativa, Indica, or hybrids to be the best sellers?&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit of a sativa snob myself but that&#039;s because I don&#039;t like falling asleep all the time.&nbsp;
