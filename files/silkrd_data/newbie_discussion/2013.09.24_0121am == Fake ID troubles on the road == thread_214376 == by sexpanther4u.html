				So here goes my troubles trying to find a valid Fake ID vendor on the SR<br /><br />In January, I tried getting a Rhode Island from KingOfClubs. After about 2 weeks of waiting, he finally told me that he didn&#039;t have the right holograms. I then just simply gave up and told me to just give me a NY one.So he took an additional 2 weeks to get the order out and finally delivered to me. The product was mediocre (for the price of $200)<br /><br />On Sept. 9 I placed an order for a Rhode Island fake ID from crcr1. He seemed genuine, and had good reviews, so I decided to give it a go, especially for the price of $120. Then, tragedy. He emailed me saying he didn&#039;t have the right holograms, and that they would be in by the following Friday if I wanted to wait. So I said yes, and on Friday I messaged him, and he said they wouldn&#039;t be in until Wednesday. I just said okay. Then I messaged him on Friday, after many un-answered messages, and he said that my ID was all processed and ready to be shipped out on Saturday. Then, I log on today and see that I have a message, from crcr1 saying that my ordered had been cancelled. That&#039;s it...<br /><br />So I&#039;m going to test my luck with CollegeHelper (something close to that)<br /><br />Lets hope for some good luck

				I have a sneaking suspicion that the Rhode Island holograms are currently difficult to obtain or create.&nbsp; Or these guys are using the same supplier that hasn&#039;t bothered to update a listing.&nbsp; Or you made two orders from the same guy who uses various vendor names.<br /><br />

				I had the exact same issue with crcr1.&nbsp; Told me that my product was packaged and ready to be shipped then he dropped off the face of the planet.&nbsp; I emailed several times and then got notification that he cancelled the order.<br /><br />After reading all of his &quot;Great reviews&quot; I have to wonder.<br /><br />Let us know how you get on with CH.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />The Gringo

				Don&#039;t order from CollegeHelper11!! <br /><br />I placed my order over three weeks ago and haven&#039;t received anything. He logs on every day, yet is unresponsive to messages. I (stupidly) FE&#039;d for free shipping, so it looks like I&#039;ve thrown my money down the drain.<br />I was going to try crcr1, but it looks like he&#039;s just as bad. leOracle and MisterReplicator look legit, but they&#039;re pricier and I&#039;m hesitant after being scammed once.

				Thanks for letting us know about College helper.&nbsp; I was going to order from them today.&nbsp; I had sent a couple messages but didn&#039;t hear back so I figured I would do one more search.<br /><br />As a newbie I always get worried when they ask for FE, which is against the SR policy right?&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone been able to find a reliable vendor with HQ and a decent price?&nbsp; It seems just as I am going to order I read another buyer getting scammed.<br /><br />Feedback please.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Gringo

				Collegehelper11 started his FE scam around the same time the BMR vendor cash4grass was busted shipping guns to three countries.&nbsp; To my understanding from clearnet, the busted BMR vendor sold fake ID&#039;s, had a partner, and also sold on Silk Road.

				Seems CollegeHelper11&#039;s account has been deleted or banned (keeps redirecting me to my message thread with him when I try to go to his profile). I also fell for his FE shipping scam for my first purchase on the road. Lost $120, feels pretty dumb but lesson learned.&nbsp;

				Yeah, CollegeHelper11 was a scam. Won&#039;t say how much money I lost, but it was over $500 (group order). Don&#039;t know why I was so stupid with the FE. I even tried to tell him that I wasn&#039;t going to place the order because he was trying to make me FE, but all my of friends kept pressuring me to make the order and get their fakes. Well, this sucks.<br /><br />I wish there was an actual legit Fake ID vendor anywhere. Anyone had any success on 24HourID.com?

				I ordered adderall from CollegeHelper11 a few days ago. I DID NOT FE, the next day it was marked in transit. Then I saw there was a 3 discussions on this vendors page..all of these people bought fake ID&#039;s and never got them, though they all did FE. The next day there were 18 discussions all about the same thing. I messaged the vendor just asking if my order was really in transit and if it was not for whatever reason would he please cancel it so I could have my BTC back to order elsewhere. It&#039;s been 2 days and no response, message is unread. AND CollegeHelper11 is no where to be found..no page, all listings gone. The only thing that shows up is the ability to message&nbsp; CollegeHelper11.&nbsp; So it&#039;s been under 10 days but I need my BTC back, I need to place an order. Can I resolve early? This vendor was shown to have been on SR everyday before ..So I think I am not getting anything in the mail I just want my BTC back and don&#039;t know what I&#039;m suppose to do. I had read all the feedback before ordering, It was all good, all good feedback for those who bought adderall as well...though that feedback was a month or two old. I did what I could to see if this was a good vendor, so I think I should be able to be refunded the whole amount. right? can someone tell me if there is any way to not wait the 10 days or whatever it is before I&#039;m alllowed to resolve? Thanks..

FE seems so so so sketchy. Especially for a newb. I&#039;m actually surprised at the massive amounts of posts and ratings where people have FE&#039;d. Some good, some bad - still sketchy. I don&#039;t see any reason a reputable vender would ask for a FE at all - for anything. If the order is placed, the shit is in escrow. If the package is tracked and delivered, whether you have to wait for auto finalization or whether the newb finalizes on time - you&#039;re still going to get your money. This whole FE business does not sit well with me. The second I see a vender who&#039;s page says &quot;FE required for newbs&quot; ... I put them on my blacklist. I don&#039;t care how many amazing and fantastic reviews they have.

				Yeah I agree, FE is shady, but it sorta makes sense to protect vendors. I feel that if you have decent stats they won&#039;t require it, and if they do then it is way more sketchy. I have 10+ orders and $1,000+ spent with no issues on finalizing, I believe I should be safe now from being required to FE... Or at least that will be my argument incase someone tries to make me FE

				I am posting this as a newbie that had to jump through hoops to find the right vendor.&nbsp; I will say that that in my experience this is a vendor that is legit and does what they say they are going to do, no BS. Paid for express and it got here as promised. When compared to a real Ill License it was difficult to tell them apart.<br /><br />I picked idsupply after researching on reddit and SR, talking with vendors, reading the forums and discussions. I also asked him several questions and he was helpful. Now I have read lot of posts so I am writing this one for the next newbie like myself.<br /><br />- The quality of the ID is very good. I did a side by side comparison and it was spot on. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this (as compared to an real Ill ID) a 9.<br />- The packaging was perfect and the express delivery (I paid for express) was perfect<br />- Did not ask for me to FE.&nbsp; Actually told me not to FE<br />- Communication was perfect, all messages were answered within 24 hours (if you expect immediate answers your in the wrong place)<br /><br />If you need an ID from ILL then I can recommend idsupply. They are not going to mess you around and you are going to get a really good looking ID for a good price.
