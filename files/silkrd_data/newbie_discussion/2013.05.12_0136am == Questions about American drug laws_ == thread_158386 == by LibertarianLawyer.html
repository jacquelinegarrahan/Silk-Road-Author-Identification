				I would just like to point out to all members considering relying on the &quot;legal advice&quot; provided here - nobody has any idea who this person is, so the advice that they give out here should not be relied upon as being legally sound. If you&#039;re in trouble with the law, consult a legal professional.<br /><br />Consider this thread and others like it purely a novelty.<br /><br />Libertas

				Anyone can say they&#039;re a lawyer on the internet - doesn&#039;t make it true, so Libertas makes a great point about taking advice from people claiming to be lawyers on the internet with a grain of salt.

It is fact specific and depends on the quantity. See 18 U.S.C. 2D1.11<br /><br />It is listed as a precursor for the manufacture of amphetamine and methamphetamine. <br /><br />It appears that the possession of 320 kg or more is illegal per se. Otherwise possession of any amount when said person &quot;knows, or has reason to believe, that it will be used to manufacture illicit drugs.&quot;<br /><br />See also 21 U.S.C. 802<br /><br />best I can do with minimal research

If you are in legal trouble (or suspect you may be), you should always consult an attorney in your jurisdiction that specializes in criminal defense (state or federal depending on the facts; many lawyers practice in state courts and are not well-versed in federal law). Your state&#039;s Bar Association can provide referrals, as well as NACDL. <br /><br />As an aside, never speak to the police without first consulting with an attorney; remember, they can, and do, lie to get information.

				If I have a small lockbox IE the kind for birth certificates and other sensitive documents in my possession when confronted with police, what rights do I have to keep them out of the box? What can they legally do to get into it? If a police dog smells something inside, are they allowed to open it?
