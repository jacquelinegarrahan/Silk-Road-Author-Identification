				&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve done alot and I&#039;d have to cast my vote to Salvia. It&#039;s the only time I actually didn&#039;t know who or what I was, or that I was on a drug. Belladona and DMT a close second. Been in a few DEEP holes too.

				Interesting question, I have not been privy to &quot;ego death&quot; as you might say.&nbsp; I am considering perhaps DMT in the future but would need a good sitter of course...

				I know you said drug, however. Two buddies and I snorted a half a bag of mud and took a couple red jelly tabs. B A N A N A S. <br /><br />Mud=Mexican Heroin <br />Red Jelly Tabs=LSD. <br /><br />Not trying to be condescending. But it was the best high I had ever had for 15 hours.

				I have had a couple really intensesessions with 25i-nbome. Although dmt probably topped those . I wish I could remember every experience of every drug ever but im getting old and forgetful due to all the drugs that I can&#039;t remember doing

				For me it was definitely Dmt. I lost all connection with my surroundings and complex fractals was all I saw after about 20 seconds. When I came back all I could say was &quot;What the fuck?&quot;

				Smoked DMT is definitely the most intense experience,like being shot out of a cannon. Oral methods such as Aya,or Pharma can be really intense and you spend much more time in hyperspace,you can get some real exploration done.

				Most intense drug experience was coma followed by a short death on Amanita muscaria.&nbsp; That was a crazy trip!&nbsp; I don&#039;t recommend it.

				Hmmm theres a few<br />DMT of course is fairly wild but it&#039;s very straight forward and has that nice soft bed of 5HT1a agonism<br />5-MeO-DMT - Fuck thats like being shot out of a cannon but it&#039;s fairly bland in terms of visual affect<br />DPT - It&#039;s like DMT but less blast off more *thunk* you&#039;re here. get used to it. for an hour or so<br />25C - I had a very high dose of this once and related it to a medium DMT trip for 5 hrs<br />Salvia - Jesus, it&#039;s just pure chaos, completely otherworldly and abstract. nuts<br />K-Holing: Not so much intense but it sure is fun and you go on a journey of epic proportions<br /><br />If I had to pick one out of them I&#039;d probably say Salvia though, with DPT in a close second but only due to it&#039;s unforgiving nature and long time frame (relative to the others that is)

Gonna have to google it.&nbsp; The weird thing about salvia is it&#039;s more intense by itself then say mixing with DMT. But they do make a nice combo. Less scary than either one on it&#039;s own.... considering your&#039;re able to hit the sally after the DMT cause your&#039;e not gonna do it the other way around!
