				There&#039;s only so much pacing a man can do before he just says. &quot;well... fuck it! HAHAHAHA Fuck it. I hope they DO find it, the bastards. Oppress me will you?&quot; 15 minutes later I&#039;m back to being Woody Allen.<br /><br />*Fair warning:&nbsp; Stop here if you do not wish to indulge this most humble soul with a cathartic release with a range of unimportant diffuse thoughts. Maybe I&#039;m totally trivial and not worth anything to anyone and might as well be dead ??? That&#039;s alright, at least you&#039;re still reading. If not that’s alright. My hope is that if someone can relate, we might just both feel&nbsp; a little less alone. We&#039;re all new for the most part. This will be about &quot;what is right&quot; You know, &quot;right&quot;? We&#039;re taught about that in preschool.*<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m experimenting with my second and third vendor at the moment. They&#039;re both very nice people. I don&#039;t quite know the ins and outs yet obviously and am now stuck waiting from Friday last week to now or who knows when, Canada express post.<br />Let me tell you; for me it’s not the most mentally pleasant exercise to sit here waiting for your product. Either you know what has happened or that sweet notice of a new package will be there soon. This brings up the point, what kind of fascist system do we live in where a man must live in fear to acquire items he decides to put into his own body? [I know, hyperbole] The government is telling me what to do with my own flesh and blood in my own home? I just shake my head. Am I the only one who finds it more unethical to conform to invasive policy? We harm nobody, not even our selves thanks to education and information. If you want to get quantum physical - butterfly effect about it then yes; perhaps we&#039;re financing other crime but how is that our fault? They do it because licensed doctors, pharmacists and support workers are not allowed to. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hey, what if a cop steps on a flower and that flower rubs spores onto his shoe? It gets carried to the white house when he is hourned for taking down a minority family who had a gream of weed, the weed wasn&#039;t actually there but what can you do? Anyway, the flowers grow into season outside and Mrs. Obama passes away as she was deathly allergic. Dismayed the president makes a small decision that ultimately escalates global politics to something that made the cold war look like a xanax dream. It&#039;s especially funny because we wouldn&#039;t be doing that if it were legal, they turn it around on us, using emotional blackmail and shame when we didn&#039;t initiate prohibition which is the cause of black markets and organized crime, filling demands. It&#039;s well known that prohibition creates crime. They actually have the nerve to blame the user? WOW! Just wow. Take a look at what he says at around 14:08: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=8KG1hnHpIJ4#t=827s<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What business do these self important strangers have coming into our homes to humiliate, steal, vandalize, assault and/or kill our animals in a raid. They assault and humiliate us in front of our families and to make matters worse we face possibly being ostracized from normal society. Really? In 2013? <br /><br />Yes, put on that uniform and punish me, I&#039;ve been so, so very bad, officer. <br />They get perverted sexual kicks from the power and the bad cops (I know there are good ones) think nothing of other living beings suffering all to satisfy some bureaucracy rooted in antiquated misconceptions and lies. All because they either feel no guilt and are psychopaths or just don&#039;t care to read about what their orders actually mean. It just makes it easier for the unethical police to take advantage, finally finding a socially acceptable excuse to be a monster; a bully who wholeheartedly accepts with motivation and ambition this sick mission. This is one of the many shameful human stories we will later have to explain.<br /><br />Done&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />If this really sucks, forgive me – I was bored on little sleep and I’m on 4.5MG, soon to me 5.5MG of clonazapam. I hope it was a passable or even tolerable first post. I think I typed this whole thing with one eye closed, haha. Hope to see you guys around.

				Hey man,<br /><br /><br />Hahaha, this is one of the funniest posts I have read in a while here! You know, I do agree with most of what you have said and you seem to have better English than what I do so I could not put it any better. But you definitely reflect my thoughts on the subject.<br /><br />I am a relatively new member, three months on the road now. I have been through this several times, oh, the pacing! There are many Canadian vendors I can recommend, I am located in the EU but if they are reliable for me (strict customs country) then they are most definitely reliable for you seen as how domestic shipments are generally safer (less security). <br /><br />Take care, man, <br /><br />Entity

				LOL, you are so right. And your funny writing earns you K+1<br />&nbsp;When my first order for more than a gram weed took unexpectedly long I had to take benzos to be able to sleep.<br />&nbsp;On the other hand, opening the mailbox to find the latest SR purchase is almost as good as the comeup with the substances itself.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				Right on! The war on drugs is utterly immoral too... how many people are injured and killed due to the illicit nature of drugs production, the impurities added, the unknown strengths and dosages, and the dodgy dealers mixing fuck-knows-what to make more profit. How many lives and futures ruined because we choose to indulge in a non-officially-approved drug unlike alcohol. If I get caught with a few tabs of acid, that&#039;s my professional career ruined for Class A possession. How many lives until this insanity ends, and the powers-that-be find their liberal roots and legalise all drugs. Locke had it right...

				Absolutely. It is so draconian. What gets me more is the public that are wholeheartedly against legalising drugs, yet they drink alcohol every weekend and never even consider the hypocrisy.

				Now far down the Rabbit hole and struggling to type, I can confidently say I have no idea what I just wrote, I&#039;ll have to come back to this tomorrow. Hey, I&#039;m on SR forums! Bonus!<br /><br />Wow, you guys,.<br /><br />Every comment that&#039;s said something nice gave me a very real buzz and it&#039;s too bad we cannot buy it here on SR. If someone was negative and they will be, I&#039;ll either take it with a grain of salt or if it is good advice, I&#039;ll incorporate it into my endeavor to create better, more memorable ideas. You must have a thick skin, surrender ego to be creative, understand and accept you don&#039;t know everything - you&#039;re only slowing yourself down. Be humble and learn.<br /><br />Writing compliments to an aspiring writer gives a boost that makes me perceive that intangible connection between people which is the highest honor and most beautiful feeling of being connected with something great. That, is why I want to be an author, not so much to get attention, I really think a certain type is shallow and highly distracting to you and your mission. To connect to the minds of others, keep up with technology, their humor and views, observe pop culture and read the classics and popular fiction.<br /><br />Well, I am so K-pinned out now I will be surprised if I&#039;m able to walk and talk, I can barely type, I wanted to say so much more to be honest I don&#039;t even know what I said before and every time I try to reread it, it&#039;s different and sometimes the letters slightly move. My mind is off doing other things right now I guess, I took the extra MG and now since I still can&#039;t sleep - maybe one more. Such an odd sensation, being on clonazapam. Makes you dumb as a post but you&#039;ll have a sound nights sleep. I can&#039;t think worth a damn and feel like I&#039;m nodding and just want a nice comfy bed. Night once again everyone it will be a small miracle if this post gets out and I am to correctly crack the verification enigma machine to submit.

				haha, love the posts Transhumanist 2.0!<br /><br />Now, the stress thing; don&#039;t go reading the stickies in the &#039;Shipping&#039; section of the forum, it will give you unneeded anxiety. All you need to know is not to sign for packages!

				I know how you feel there man, but if you are only new and can not stand the waiting then maybe using local vendors like I have to get used to the delivery times and such first.<br /><br />Albeit local is faster it may not be the best prices, but you know you will have a higher chance of it getting to you.<br /><br />Also remembering that as much as we would all like to control our local postal service, we can not :P<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t that make business so much better for SR, every vendor being able to push their mail through faster lol.
