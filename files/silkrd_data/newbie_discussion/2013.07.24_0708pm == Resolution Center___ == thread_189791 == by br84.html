				I was buying stuff. The seller couldn&#039;t deliver in time and I had to go on a holiday, couldn&#039;t do a thing and now when I&#039;m back no deliver but instead Silk Road has frozen my monies and so I cannot use them in bitcoins. They say contact Resolution Center. Where´s that? Can anybody tell me how do I get money back? Or transform those in bitcoins? Or was I ripped off?

				Not sure exactly what post above is talking about, but i too am interested in any info on the resolution process.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;ve been on SR for over 7 months, and I&#039;ve never had to use resolution.&nbsp; i&#039;ve got an order out right now that is not looking good.&nbsp; curious how the resolution process works, how long it takes, what are the chances i&#039;ll get my BTCs back (vendor said he mailed it, gave me a tracking number that did not work, and said he would reship, but has not yet).&nbsp; What is the criteria for getting a refund?&nbsp; And is there any way to do it without ruining my perfect buyer stats?&nbsp; Any info is appreciated.

				at the very bottom of any Silk Road page is three links for community forums:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/<br /><br />Wiki for Silk Road: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />and &quot;support&quot;. Click the &quot;support&quot; and go thru the process of reading up on it and get educated on what options you have.<br /><br />Ok you have to try to work with the system so any time you anticipate being gone for a few days or what ever then it&#039;s best to not go out until everything is finalized for or go ahead and FE with the proper explanation. Reputation is everything and when a vendor sees a buyer that doesn&#039;t finalize in a timely fashion then they may put you on the list in the vendors forum which could lead to vendors not wanting to sell to you.<br /><br />

				I bought two products from a vendor. The first arrived some late, but because it came OK, it was alright with me. I was waiting for a second which was much too late. I thought I’ll leave it like that and perhaps the stuff has come when I’ll be back from my holiday.<br /><br />Now instead of getting the product I have gotten none and my monies look like this: escrow (usd) $41, escrow (btc) 0,00 available 0,0483. And now even hear that possible I have put some vendors black list. Can somebody, please, help me with this thing?<br />
