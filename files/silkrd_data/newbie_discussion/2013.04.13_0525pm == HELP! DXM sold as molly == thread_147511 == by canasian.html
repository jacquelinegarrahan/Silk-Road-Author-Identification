				I&#039;ve recently bought &quot;molly&quot; but when I tested it, it was DXM.<br />When we first tested the dust, we thought it instantly turned black.<br />However, one of us caught a sight of smoke...yes smoke<br />we cut off a bit from a rock and this time observed closely.<br />There was definitely smoke coming out, slight of purple and green, but it was so dark that it looks totally black<br />and they changed colour pretty quickly.<br />I&#039;m new to the forum, albeit being a frequent SR user, and I didn&#039;t want to shoot<br />off accusation before taking the respectable procedure on the forum <br />since I&#039;m new to the forum, never heard of DXM being sold as molly or in a crystal rock form really (and fuck! it <br />looks like some good ass molly too! but then its all chemical...) and most importantly the vendor is taking<br />a random break, so I feel like its safe to take a bit longer and take the proper precautions<br /><br />or should I just rip my keyboard and type away accusations?!&nbsp; ???

				Another reason for precaution:<br />the vendor isn&#039;t new, he&#039;s been around for awhile and has decent ratings (94~) and<br />no scatchy ass looking listings.

				it seems as if the test makes it kind of hard to differentiate between DXM and MDMA since it&#039;s kind of up to interpretation,<br /><br />taken from erowid page on mdma testing<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ecstasy-like substances may emit a tiny bit of smoke (generally not as much as DXM) and will begin turning color immediately.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d do it, but I would consider testing some by ingesting. MDMA and DXM should be super easy to tell apart after taking.

				hmmm..thanks! <br />but wouldn&#039;t Ecstasy-like substance be not ecstasy either way?<br />since it&#039;s a &quot;like&quot; substance? not to discredit you but just out of<br />curiosity!&nbsp; ::)

				I hadn&#039;t really thought of that, so I checked back<br /><br />referenced from http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_faq_testing_kits.shtml<br /><br />I think in terms of that page, when they refer to ecstasy like substances they mean MDMA, MDE, MDA, as they have the same charactistics in the Marquis test.<br /><br />how old the test itself is also matters,

				x as stated is known to smoke a bit ive saw it turn pinkish before going to dark purple black and was good. i also witnessed a test that was certainly mdma with some other sort of cut that caused some change in color that was odd however turned out to be a good dose. does it have a licorice smell or?

				Put it on your tongue and do a taste test. DXM tastes very acrid like a cleaning chemical while mdma tastes like the bitterest tartest candy you&#039;ve ever had in your life. Also 100 mg of DXM isn&#039;t really even an active dose however 100 mg of ecstacy is definitely an active dose that you will notice. Just try it the two chemicals are very different you&#039;ll know the difference.
