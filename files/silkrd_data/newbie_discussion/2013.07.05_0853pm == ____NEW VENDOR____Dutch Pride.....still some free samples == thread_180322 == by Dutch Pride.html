				Hallo everyone, I just wanted to drop in and say I received my sample from Dutch Pride today. I wont try the product in like a week or so but full review coming then. I took a pic of the DMT for you guys as well. (If you don&#039;t want this here Dutch Pride just pm me) - http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/4wz.jpg<br /><br />But yeah I&#039;d say order with confidence from this vendor. Product as you can see looks legit and smells just like dmt should as well so not worried what so ever.<br /><br />As mentioned full review coming after product has been tried. Thank you for the sample Dutch Pride! :)

				Hello all, I received my sample from Dutch Pride but I won&#039;t be able to review the product itself for a few day so I&#039;m only here now to confirm its arrival and review the packaging and the appearance of the DMT.<br /><br />Shipping time: Sent weekend arrived Friday, this I put down to my countries postal service as the Dutch have a very good one based on my experience with other Dutch vendors.<br /><br />Stealth: There was no vac seal or anything similar but there was some stealth there, DP I would recommend investing in something like that for larger orders but for this one there&#039;s no problem as it is here!<br /><br />Appearance: Exactly how it should look/smell I&#039;ve had yellow DMT before and this is definitely it. Please refer to Zookie&#039;s picture a few posts up this is exactly what mine looks like (unsurprisingly).<br /><br />Quality/experience: Will update once I&#039;ve tried and let you all know where DPs product takes me. Very excited about trying it.<br /><br />So overall I say Dutch Pride is a great new vendor with good products. Thanks mate!<br />

				Hello DutchPride,<br /><br />Welcome to the road as a vendor, and to the forum&#039;s guys. If there are still samples going I&#039;d be happy to offer a detailed and honest report.<br />I&#039;ve previously provided detailed reviews for Jesus Of Rave when he was selling on the road, both Pills &amp; LSD, but would love the opportunity to review<br />your DMT. Links to my reviews for JOR can be found below....<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46574.msg524314#msg524314<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46574.msg502877#msg502877<br /><br /><br />Regards<br />PlanB 8)

				Sup everybody, here&#039;s my review of Dutch Pride.<br /><br />Communication: Dident do a lot of talking with the vendor but he seemed like a nice guy who knew what he was doing. Responses was quick. All good. 5/5<br /><br />Shipping: Took 3 days to arrive to Scandinavia which is great. Order was shipped out the day after I placed the order. 5/5<br /><br />Packaging: The letter looks business like and address was printed. Inner stealth could use something like a MBB or along those lines. There was stealth there just no bag. Still for small orders it&#039;s all good. Bigger one you might want to invest in something like that. 4.5/5<br /><br />Product: I&#039;ve had some go&#039;s with DMT before but never really had a successful go. This time I loaded up around 40mg in my bong. Took a huge rip and held it in for as long as possible. Almost instantly I was shoot in the face by this stuff. I tried to take another hit but my idiot friend kept distracting me rendering me to lost to take another one. I had the most amazing visuals I have ever had. And I consider myself pretty experienced with phycs. 5/5<br /><br />Thank you very much for the sample Dutch Pride! Hope you have great success here.

				I received an order from Dutch Pride this week - a 150mg and a 250mg bag of their DMT.<br /><br />Communication: Little needed - order dispatched really quickly 5/5<br /><br />Shipping: Was with me within 36 hours of my order - very fast 5/5<br /><br />Packaging: Nice stealth - as the poster above says, some MBB might be better here 4.5/5<br /><br />Product: <br />&nbsp;- Quality 5/5 - good, very clean DMT, very little oxide content, wonderful trip on 35mg vaporized. <br />&nbsp;- Weight 3/5 - 150 mg weighed 156mg, but 250mg bag weighed only 224mg, so 20mg under in total (5% of 400mg order)<br /><br />Overall a good experience - I&#039;ll certainly order again
