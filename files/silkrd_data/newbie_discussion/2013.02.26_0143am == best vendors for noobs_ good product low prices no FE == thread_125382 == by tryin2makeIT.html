				If you gave us more context to what you were interested in the help would be more appropriate. That being said, I am here for the green. I made my first buy today from Marly&#039;smainman. I did FE early. Because I was told not to in a guide. Before I did though. I did get in touch and read all the feedback of the vendor. And they replied and said that I would get a free extra gram of whatever I had already bought. <br /><br />With FE you have a chance to get a nice deal on your first purchase. I advise that whatever it is you are interested, even after you hear someone say, oh. So and so are good vendors. Too also research and read feedback and their entire page. Packaging, to shipping. It is your best bet. In the end you&#039;re making the decision. So yea. I hope I helped a little at least. Good luck.<br /><br />Even when a human is doing nothing, they&#039;re doing something.

				I wish they would stop vendors asking for people to FE, I have done it with my first 2 orders (still waiting on delivery) and I know I would feel a lot better about it if I didn&#039;t FE. It&#039;s only been 2-3 days so I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been scammed. But whats the point in escrow at all when you can&#039;t use it and protect yourself.

				Have to agree with Qthello. I can understand no FE on any purchase of weight but for grams wtf is the big deal if the offer of extra is worth it? If it works great, if it doesn&#039;t then oh no I&#039;m out $30 and I know this guy is an asshole. To go FE on something you can&#039;t afford to lose is of course foolish.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey guys, quick question of advice here..<br /><br />If you had to choose from a vendor offering similar product, but one of them NEEDS FE for new buyers..<br />The other vendor welcomes new buyers, has a little bit of a better of a reputation, and requires no FE.<br /><br />The vendor with no FE required, offers half the amount of product for the same price as other vendor.<br /><br />ex. vendor 1= 50 pieces for $100<br />(no FE)vendor 2= 25 pieces for $100<br /><br />Who would you choose? I am new :)

				Keep in mind that the vendor with the lowest prices will often be the one who requires FE.&nbsp; Because FE substantially lowers the cost of doing business (scamming buyers use<br />escrow) this dealer can sell for less and make the same profit as a dealer who does full escrow.&nbsp; Whether you want to FE or not is an important choice, but make sure you are going into it eyes wide open.&nbsp; Nothing is free, and this includes escrow.

I have been beating out other vendors for boomers for almost a year now. I have sold for around 40-70% the price of any competitor and I NEVER have asked for FE. With enough research, you can find a decent deal on almost ANY drug on SR if you just look around the site and do like the OP did and check with others in the forum for vendor advice. Not all &quot;cheap&quot; vendors need you to FE. In fact, a vendor&#039;s use of FE should point out to you if the vendor is able to restock supply properly without relying on your order to cover the costs. Vendors that can cover costs themselves will thrive here while the FE will slowly just go away except for a handful of vendors that still use it due to impossible margins like middle-manning marijuana(middle-manning mj is one of the WORST ways to try and make money).

				FE is OK if you are careful who you deal with.&nbsp; Look at the stats and make sure they have a load of transactions and a clean history.&nbsp; Most sellers who have great feedback want to keep it and keep making money.

				I am pretty nOOb friendly I never require anyone to FE have great feedback and am a (100).But that&#039;s not much help if I don&#039;t list what your looking for. However I can source just about anything via private listing and with me you know your going to get your product You may be able to hunt down better prices from others on stuff I don&#039;t list but a lot of people are willing to pay a bit more for the product ifs it&#039;s a sure thing

				ME!&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D<br /><br />But seriously, me. I know i am a Noob, only been here for two to three months, but i try to maintain high standards. I sell DMT, Changa, occasionally MDMA and soon some LSD tabs and hopefully liquid. I don&#039;t force anyone to FE, use tracked, no sign express post and maintain a high Feedback score, over 98%. I aim to get everyone&#039;s purchases to them in less than 72 business hours from placement of order and when requested will use express post platinum.You probably shouldn&#039;t take my word for it, but my stealth is second to none. I dispatch purchases every day, except Friday and Saturday.<br /><br />Occasionally i offer optional Finalize Early Bonuses (25% extra by weight), but the key is that they are optional. I also accept anyone&#039;s orders, no matter how few purchases they have made. Auto Finalize is annoying, but not the end of the world, SR is a hobby, not my primary source of income.<br /><br />Been scammed myself, this week by Enter The Matrix locally for 600AUD, and also by some quite large overseas vendors for even more, but i remain positive.<br /><br />Also plan to be here for a long time.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5bdaf982d1<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				As I previously posted. I did FE early with my first purchase. I just received said purchase. They added an extra g, the quality is on point and it arrived in a timely fashion. I cannot get to the main sr page. I did want to let you know that I am very happy. <br /><br />Keep in mind my purchase was small and simple. However, I knew what I was doing and just like in the street there is a chance you&#039;re going to get ganked. Even if I did get ganked I would have no room too bitch. Again I am messing with small time shit and weight. <br /><br />Keeping it simple does help though. I bought from Marlysmainman.

				HeartofHumbolt is my go to vendor for top notch weed at reasonable prices; lightning fast shipping, high quality smoke, and always has a variety of strains.&nbsp; <br /><br />The main reason I purchased my 1st oz from HeartofHumbolt, because he was one of the few top vendors that accepted new buyers without requiring FE.&nbsp; I was a little reluctant that there were no pictures of the product, only pics of a little cute bunny; but after checking the stats and reading reviews; I felt confident that I would receive a quality product.&nbsp; <br />After receiving my 1st oz I never looked back!! The #1 thing that sets HeartofHumbolt (aka HoH) apart from other vendors is his/her willingness to please the customer!!! :) :)<br /><br />If you have a request, just send HoH a message; all of my requests have always been accommodated. (ie Splitting an oz 4 ways in order to get a good sampling of various strains).

				Hi All,<br /><br />I&#039;ll be starting to sell green once this crop comes in. As I don&#039;t have any positive feedback (due to zero sales so far might I add!) I won&#039;t be requesting ANYONE to FE. But in return, I won&#039;t be shipping out more than 3.6G per order. So if some buyer does decide to claim the package didn&#039;t arrive or whatever, I lose only a small amount. BUT, when the non scamming people of SR receive their order, and are overwhelmed by quality of packaging, product, and customer service, they will finalise their order and I&#039;ve won a customer :)<br /><br />If anyone&#039;s interested in reading my T&amp;C&#039;s, check them out at http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/6d2a775602<br /><br />CKUK

				Some vendors will work with you if send them a PM explaining your situation and asking nicely, fwiw. If it&#039;s somebody who you&#039;ve read has quality gear that you want to try, then send them a PM and ask. I got my first two orders from established vendors who didn&#039;t need any newbie buys that way. Be professional and courteous. Tell them you want to fuck with THEM and not some other vendor. Obviously use your best judgment here. If someone comes across as a dickhead in their profile, they&#039;re probably going to say no.

				If you&#039;re looking for&nbsp; the best medicinal marijuana on the road. Lionware trading is amazing! Their very professional. In my opinion there is no better stealth or product on SR. It also, always weighs heavy. Furthermore, they are also currently giving out .25g of their bho with any 1/8, and that shit is amazing!<br /><br /><br />I have only made a handful of purchases on the Road. I looked over several vendors before placing an order. However, they are the only place I spend my btc for fine marijuana.

				Excellent thread, learned a lot. So, how do you not have to FE if you have nada buys? I suppose the best way is just buy some .02 items, let em get to you and then after 5 your usually OK. If you think about it, one of &quot;our&quot; habits are; we want what we want NOW. And here you have to have patience. You have no choice. <br /><br />Anyway, keep the info rolling and thanks!!!

				UKPharma is outstanding for vallies, although a bit low on stock but has some., has xanax, viagra and mogadon I haven&#039;t tried, all vallies are blistered. Post really quick and is an all round sound fella.<br /><br />BitcoinsUK is the go-to guy for small amounts right now, usually cash in mail, he mentioned UKbank2bank, but I know him fairly well, so I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the norm, ask him.<br /><br />K Queen&#039;s mdma was pretty darn good, spot on stealth, and super quick delivery.<br /><br />Thanks to the OP for such a sensible thread!<br /><br />

				I made 7 transactions, spending ~$30 on stuff I didn&#039;t care about before ordering a gram of mdma and a gram of coke, both of which I didn&#039;t have to FE on. There is stuff out there to make small transactions on. I would try to spend some money. Having 5 transactions, $0 spent isn&#039;t very impressive. I bought some books, a fortune, a pack of cloves(vendor: Smokeables - would recommend), and some other stuff. Except for my last two orders I would finalize as soon as a could, which in most cases is just after they send you a link to the download.

There are ways to get cash into your SR account w/o any ID. I just did this. <br /><br />I went through bitinstant. Cash deposit at CVS via Moneygram ---&gt; Mtgox -----&gt; SR. <br /><br />I know some people would add in another step between Mtgox and SR but, I was already anonymous so I wasn&#039;t that paranoid. I just made up names/emails for using bitinstant/mtgox and logged in from a public computer that I didn&#039;t have to register to be on at a library. I was not asked for ID at CVS, I only put in $200, larger amount may attract more attention and requests for ID. In my case, completely anonymous, save for being on some cctv at cvs.

				Hey guys, I&#039;m a new vendor on here selling Black Tar Heroin. I will not make any new people finalize early. I&#039;ve been a new customer before and I remember how much I hated that, not to mention the stress you go through while waiting for your product to arrive not knowing if you got jacked or not. Please check out my ads. I just got my first review yesterday be sure to read that the link is at the bottom of my ads. Also for a limited time I&#039;m selling .25 Gram sample bags for super cheap price. Do a search of my name (diamorphius) or just paste the URL links and go directly to my adds listed below:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d07f96bbfe<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b70e9f3249<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d9f132e5ed<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/095e3a7a74

				Its all about reputation. read his stats. Was he last seen today? 99 rate? over 3 months vendor? are YOU a reputable buyer? if you answer yes to all the above, go ahead and FE, although you shouldn&#039;t you have to understand that these guys get hit by scammers pretty often so give them a break!
