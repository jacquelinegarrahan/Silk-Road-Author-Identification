				I dont understand how the prices dont get driven down, like if youre manufacturing the product and theres a guaranteed buyer base the lower price would mean more sales. Obviously theres a point where youre not making enough profit but lots of the drugs are street value or more as far as I can tell. <br /><br />What have you found are the best deals per doseage on here regularly?

				RC&#039;s are obviously a good deal on SR.<br /><br />You can get some 25i around here for a dollar a tab, or even 25cents a tab, if you do bulk purchases.

				You kind of have it backwards, if there is a guaranteed demand for a drug then the suppliers control the market, and they will sell it for as much as people are willing to pay. <br />Also it&#039;s different on SR because vendors take a small risk with every package they send, so they want to be making a decent profit.

I had more in mind LEGAL RC&#039;s supplier. Around here, they sell only to university-grade researchers with papers, and authorization if the product is illegal. I believe what you are talking about are &quot;legal&quot; Chinese products that you import illegally, which kinda ruins the purpose of RC&#039;s. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I&#039;m mostly a stoner and where I live is bountiful in homegrown buds. Unfortunately, the hash is either oil form, which is too messy and doesn&#039;t taste as nice in my opinion, or of mediocre quality. I can get much higher quality and selection on SR&#039;s hash.

				Not every vendor deals in bulk but for those who do, check out the various quantities and do the math. When you get to the big packages it does get significantly cheaper. However, it also means putting down $$$ and maybe more importantly, facing &quot;possession with intent to distribute&quot; charges if caught. Personal use amounts are safer (but more expensive).

				Cola, in my opinion is ridiculously overpriced...i dont know how the hell the prices got that high.&nbsp; Prob because all of the shitty ass vendors out there that sell nothin&nbsp; but garbage... so maybe its priced like that because it is rare?&nbsp; I can totally deal with some of the dank prices, and oil
