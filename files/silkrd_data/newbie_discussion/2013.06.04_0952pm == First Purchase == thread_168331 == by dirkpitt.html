				Hi<br />First let me say both this forum and SR is so cool&nbsp; 8). Better than sliced bread :D :D<br />My main journey to this site, is to finally get some great cocaine.&nbsp; The stuff on the streets is so bad that I don&#039;t bother anymore :-[<br />I don&#039;t run with the &quot;wild crowd&quot; any longer, and finding a good connection is nearly impossible.<br />I have read all the warning&#039;s about not to FE, but I am going to be purchasing c on my first purchase<br />I read on most domestic vendors sites, request FE if low stats/# of purchases?<br />Should I just buy a few other cheap items to get my # of purchases up, or just place the order<br />Any help would be great.<br /><br />Thanks a million :)

				Can I give some help...<br /><br />I&#039;m a fairly new vendor selling very very good coke. <br /><br />I have absolutely no interest in FE and have been really happy to report the deals have been smooth, friendly and professional on both sides (so far!)<br /><br />So, find a nice guy, often us new ones are worth a shot as we offer small quantities to test as we establish ourselves and cred...and trust instinct...as good a way as any (obviously do the common sense checks - read abut them, check their transactional record and feedback etc)<br /><br />Anyway, if not me, there&#039;s lots to choose from...go for quality every time :)<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Doc

				Hi Doc<br />Thank you very much for my first reply.... :D :D :D<br />I am waiting to get my BTC and I will be off and running.<br />As soon as I get my account loaded, I will check your goods.<br />I know everyone says this but, I will always leave feedback&nbsp; :)<br />and most important, I will always finalize within minutes of receiving, never auto Finalize (seventeen days is way to long for someone cool enough to do this)<br /><br />Thanks again<br />You da Man

				I think its fairly safe ordering from vendors who have a large amount of transactions, and a high rating. Go through the comments in their history and look up their name on the forums for their review thread, it would be impossible for someone with 200-300+ transactions and pages of good reviews to be a scam, without it being littered with people who got ripped off. The only time you could possible get ripped off is if your especialy unlucky and the vendor decides to quit and just take as much money as he can before he goes(from what i can tell, it happens, but its very unlikely). <br /><br />Just do your research and find a good vendor and order something not super expensive, whats super expensive is different for everyone, but for me its around 200-300$(the max i&#039;m spending on an order that I&#039;m FEing).<br />really its sooooo easy to scam a vendor i can completely understand vendors wanting newbies to FE.

				Just buy what you need from trusted vendors and try not to FE.
