				Unfortunately, I am on state probation and am subject to warrantless searches of home and vehicles. I am extremely curious about ordering some LSD off of the silk road, as I have not found any in my home town for almost a year now. I know its not the greatest idea, but can anyone give me any insight as to how safe it actually can be, I know of all drugs, LSD is probably the most concealable. And would it be alot safer to order it domestic, so it won&#039;t touch customs? Its soooooo tempting looking at the site when I haven&#039;t seen any real L in person for months. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!

				It&#039;s generally pretty safe, but if you get caught, you&#039;re fucked.&nbsp; I&#039;d advise waiting until you&#039;re off probation.

				I feel like LSD is probably the safest thing you can order, especially WoW. Blotter papers look sketch, but just pack a few sheets of WoW in an envelope and add a little stealth and you&#039;re golden. I feel completely safe ordering L, and always have.

I&#039;d say you are safe as long as you are not under some type of watch for whatever charge you got that lead to prob.

				No, I&#039;m not on watch.I&#039;ve already been through court and went to jail for a little bit, and the charge was just a really small time resale charge. The problem was I was selling LSD, LSD is a schedule I drug, so for a first offense, it was pretty substantial. 5 years state probation, hella fines etc. But they know I wasn&#039;t a big time dealer, I just got set up by an informant and only sold him 10 hits.

				LSD IS the safest thing to ship...its paper. <br />Be careful though, they might have your mail/address etc tagged and idk if they cant warrantlessly search mail/mailbox but i wouldn&#039;t be surprised. Try and find IRL connect you trust maybe a friend you&#039;ve tripped with. But acid is easily the safest thing to ship especially domestically from a trusted SR vendor...<br /><br />And that sucks about that rat... was he undercover LEO or a buyer that flipped on you??

				To the best of my knowledge LSD cant be smelled by dogs, both because they arnt trained to and the amount of lsd needed to make it noticeable to them would be huge im guessing a thousand hits or more. If you order domestically with a dealer that uses a mbb or normal plastic seal technique then your pretty much golden. Im not sure if they would have to get a warrant to open your mail but im pretty sure they would unless its already in your house/car/pocket already opened. In fact that would be a good question for a lawyer if you post it on one of the ask a lawyer sites out there.

				It is very safe, however, I would not fuck around with it until after you are off probation. I would find a friend and tell him you are getting a couple tabs sent to his house in return he will get 3 for free. Whatever you do, keep the drugs out of your house. When you decide to trip, go to your friends and take your tabs and drive home with no evidence. Then just pray to God that your PO doesnt show up mid trip.

				Patience is important not only when waiting on a pack to be delivered, but also when deciding when to place your order.<br /><br />In my opinion wait until you are off probation. Even if it is delivered safely what if your PO pays you a visit while you are tripping, that would be uncomfortable!

				Yeah it seems really safe, I think partly because it is kinda rare/niche so not something police/customs would necessarily be looking out for/expecting. Except in your case they are, because you&#039;ve been busted with it. Getting it delivered to a trusted friend might does seem to make more sense...

				It&#039;s probably the safest drug to ship - you should DEFINITELY go domestic if you can IMO, there&#039;s always a chance customs could get nosy.<br />That said, accidents do happen at the post office, I don&#039;t know where you live (although you said state so I&#039;m going to take a stab and say America), but things get spilled on mail, or it gets ripped open etc, then (if it&#039;s something legal) it can be repacked with an apology from the postman. If that package happens to contain LSD on it&#039;s way to someone on probation though...eek. <br />It&#039;s a small chance, and it&#039;s really up to you...you&#039;ll probably be OK but you are taking more of a risk than someone not on probation. Personally I wouldn&#039;t do it unless I could find a friend to receive it for me...anyone you could ask?

				<br />I would wait, especially if you&#039;re still living in the same area or at the same location you were when you were arrested to begin with. Seriously. Yes, LSD is one of the safest drugs to order if you&#039;re a wide-eyed innocent with a squeaky record and a mailbox that gets stuffed full with letters and eBay packages and catalogs. If you&#039;re on probation FOR SELLING LSD it&#039;s not safe. What if the vendor you order from gets arrested the week you place your order, or what if customs - after a tip off - starts paying extra-close attention to his or her mailings? Because you&#039;re on probation you wouldn&#039;t be able to deny any inquiring LEOs entry, or even demand a warrant. They&#039;d have your computer in no time. <br /><br />If you&#039;re still not sure, go look at the sentencing guidelines that apply when a crime is committed by someone already in custody. I highly doubt you&#039;ll regret waiting to place an order. SR will still be here when you&#039;re free again. <br /><br />Btc.
