				An alien planet spotted by Nasa&#039;s Kepler space telescope is the best candidate yet for an Earth-like world beyond our solar system, Scientists claim.<br />The planet - whose existence is yet to be positively confirmed. has a radius that is just 1.5 times that of our own and orbits in the &#039;habitable zone&#039; of a star similar to our own Sun.<br />That means the planet would likely have a similar amount of gravity as Earth and liquid water could exist on its surface - making it a prime candidate to host alien life.<br /><br />The possible planet is called KOI 172.02 - with the initial trio of letters standing for Kepler Object of Interest, a prefix given to all planetary candidates found by Kepler until their existence is confirmed.<br />Dr Batalha said the find had the potential to be the closest so far to an Earth-twin beyond the solar system. It orbits a G-type star that is only slightly cooler than our own Sun, she said.<br />&#039;Previously the ones we saw were orbiting other types of stars,&#039; she was quoted as saying by SPACE.com.<br /><br /><br />

				Nice post, thought I&#039;d bump this since it was getting ignored. <br /><br />How they find it? From the slight wobble or from it passing between the star and us?

				If I&#039;m not&nbsp; mistaken the closest star system is 2-3 lightyears away. Is it the Centauri system which is a dual-star system or did i just get that from sci-fi novels...? That&#039;s very very far when you think about our current propulsion drives, the Ion drive was interesting though but with America in a financial crisis they scrapped the shuttle and many other programs like testing new propulsion systems... Anyone wanna come in here and share you&#039;re Sagan-like wisdom on this?
