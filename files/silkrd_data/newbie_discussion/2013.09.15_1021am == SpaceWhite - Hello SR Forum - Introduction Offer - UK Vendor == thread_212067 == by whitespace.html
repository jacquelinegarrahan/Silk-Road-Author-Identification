				Hello guys from SpaceWhite<br /><br />We are new UK vendors here on SR, we hope to become amongst the top sellers and will strive to make this happen!<br /><br />We are UK Vendors of:<br /><br />*** High Quality Cocaine ***<br /><br />We aim to provide this at decent honest prices, our product is good quality and you will struggle to find a better price for this product. This is NOT street crap!<br /><br />We understand customer satisfaction = loyalty and we aim to provide complete satisfaction.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We are really looking for to getting the ball rolling - so in way of a introduction we are offering the first 10 UK customers to PM us on SR a discounted price from the listed price. So what you waiting for?<br /><br />*** At this time we are NOT sending out of the UK, we wish to building a UK base first.

				Crybgie.<br /><br />We can see it looks that way but it isn&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;ll tell you what, just for you if you contact me via SR, I&#039;ll send you a free sample and if its legit then you can correct the post?<br /><br />We understand the only way to drive sales is by building trust.

I would have thought that with being a vendor for less that a day, he needs to get the hang of selling and posting first. <br /><br />Also to WhiteSpace, I would recommend getting your way to 50 posts and posting in the Product Offers section, I would think that you&#039;d get alot more attention over there. :)<br />~D

				<br />Hi,<br /><br />We obviously buy in bulk but not here on SR, the prices vendors charge (domestically) it would hardly be viable with the effort.<br /><br />We would never buy internationally on SR in bulk, way too much risk.<br /><br />Does anyone successful ship internationally from the UK? Somebody I know works for one the major couriers and said the private courier firms tend to have much higher security checks that the RM.<br /><br />My offer still stands for anybody that wants a sample, We are willing to negotiate on the first 10 initial orders to help prove we legit.
