				Hey guys, I was wondering who else here is a big fan of The Man. Who is more focused on psychedelics? Who else believes that shrooms and DMT are the way to rescue the mankind from the trap of our culture? For me, Terence is like a prophet of my own religion - the Nature, the Universe. I link my future with helping shrooms to grow and enlighten the society. I believe that they are an intergalactic way to achieving higher intelligence. So who&#039;s with me? :)

				I don&#039;t agree with the limitation to DMT and Psilocybin.<br />Many psychedelics like Mescaline, DPT, LSD and 2C-B (AND FOR TEH LOVE OF GOD DONT FORGET SALVINORIN A) can free humanity from the hatred that fills us.

				Not a big fan. I&#039;m more into the classical thinkers like leary, metzer, ram dass and the like. Think mckenna has done a lot of harm with his theories. Or the misinterpetations of them. I guess I could study his ideas a bit more. But every time I do I just don&#039;t agree fully. The thing I find most disheartening about mckenna and his lackeys is there lack of God in their souls. It seems they do these substances that are pieces of gods own flesh, but don&#039;t believe in god. Anyway we all know his theories are so correct, I mean timewave zero happened.&nbsp; Wait it didn&#039;t, or did it????&nbsp; We may yet not have seen.

				Nigl, By writing down only shrooms and dmt I only meant them as examples. Of course there are many, many other substances that can positively affect our consciousnesses. I am about to try SALVINORIN A for the first time in my life only by days now :DD My psychonaut experience is based on Psilocybin and LSD mainly, and other acids to like nbome but I do want to expand in this matter for sure.<br />I don&#039;t know if I agree fully with everything he said. Is that even possible? It shouldn&#039;t be. Every individual has different ideas. When he spoke, he always seemed to be terribly sure of his thoughts, feelings.&nbsp; Most of them cover with mine. But not all. For example, I am personally very religious man. I identify Universe with God. When I take psychedelics, I am focused on the divinity of things I see and feel.<br />I just like his style and appreciate him very much. For me, he was a mainly a great speaker, but I know him only from the films and articles. LiquiFried, have you attended to his talks? WOW! I envy you.

				Hi gshamen, sorry for the delay, just came back online..... yeah, I listened to a couple of his talks that were broadcast on WFMU in New Jersey, this must&#039;ve been.....late 80&#039;s sometime... I was definitely intrigued, being in my mid 20&#039;s at the time n seein the Dead a couple of dozen times/year.&nbsp; I drove by myself to a little school hall in...shit!.. ...Brooklyn or Queens...it was a bunch of college students and some serious older Freaks.&nbsp; His talks were an opportunity for believers and Community and the curious to meet together.&nbsp; &nbsp;Good&nbsp; Stuff! Hardcore psychedelic folx.. I was saddened to hear he was sick and then next thing you know, he was gone.&nbsp; An Original, for sure.

				I am very happy to read all these warm responses to my question :)<br />Especially yours LiquiFried, that is quuite an atmospheric depiction, here. Brooklyn or Queens&nbsp; :o That is just like pure movie for me, I am from Central Europe and know these places only from movies. For example Brooklyn from the Brooklyn Boogie and Smoke :P It must have been really, really exciting, what he spoke, and how people reacted. You had some groovy times and places to live in ;) It was one fine opportunity. You are born in some place and that&#039;s what you are really, that is what you feel on psychedelics, that&#039;s what Terence spoke about.&nbsp; And I understand and admire what he said about trap of the culture, in the meaning he meant, but still, I can&#039;t say I don&#039;t admire culture as well. Terence was part of the culture somehow, right? I love movies and books, and of course american movies too, with american values, they amuse me. Tarantino and 4chan...culture pulp, playing on the motifs. On the other side I hate other things created by the new, western world like capitalism and industrial breeding...<br />For me, it is hard to have only one attitude in such a diverse world.

				@noiamunclesyd On the other hand I have shortages of knowledge in the group of people you mentioned. And that is why I am here, for more knowledge. I have to dig deeper, you know?&nbsp; ;) I know Leary mainly from the film &#039;Albert Hoffman&#039;s LSD&#039; and I liked him even if he was criticized there for giving LSD to very young people. I think that he knew very good if someone was ready. Made an impression of a brilliant scientist for me. And the brilliant scientist on LSD! That is something!&nbsp; ;D He also spoke very good, great orator. He interested me and after watching that film I read about him. Wanted to get &#039;Timothy Leary is dead&#039; but it is very hard to download and I didn&#039;t wanted to watch on YT so i gave up....

				Leary and McKenna are examples for the crazy ideas people get when using psychedelics too often.<br />Didn&#039;t Leary communicate with aliens (starseed transmissions) ?<br />And that bogus Timewave Zero theory by McKenna...<br />Complete nonsense IMO.

				Well, like neuronirvana wrote above - we all commit mistakes... About Timewave Zero - Terence spoke about year 2012, right? Top point of singularity and that stuff.. Well, he was wrong :P Or maybe just missed with the year... People built platforms for their views by chosing different ways, sometimes they can get lost.<br />Hopeful7 - Your son get to know about him because of you, right!?&nbsp; :D I thought about it, when I will have my son, I will teach him about neat people like Terence too :)<br />

				Again I may not be a fan, but do respect the man and his work. And I admit I need to look at his work more closely myself to be any kind of critic at all. Like was stated not everything he talked about you fully believe. I threw out some names and especially leary, I don&#039;t agree with a lot of either. But he helped a lot of people including me turn on. My first exposure was a friends dads library with many good reads. One was an autographed leary book, I forget which one. I do remember a big square vut out of the page where leary must have dotted the I in his name witha LARGE drop of LSD. I like the opposite page achieving threshold or probable placebo effects. But still. The psychedelic experience, a manual based on the tibetan book of the dead is amazing. But I already had extensive lsd use under my belt, and most things in the book helped me organize and then break threw the things I was already experiencing.&nbsp; I also like ram dass and the only dance there is.&nbsp; He takes things defenetly in more of a godhead direction. My college also had old issues of the psychedelic researcher. Or something llike that. It was a research periodical on the research of lsd and other such substances. If you can get on the silk road and order lsd, then finding all this stuff online for free should be no problem either.&nbsp; ;)

				Exactly! People like Leary and McKenna help us to turn on. And sometimes drop out, hehe&nbsp; ;) It is really cool story with that book and signature! I mean - REALLY! :D What a witty idea for a signature. It couldn&#039;t been done better, LSD become part of him.<br />I always felt sympathy for Tibet for some reason. I will read about Tibetan Book of the Dead for sure. And maybe some day teh Book itself. I am fresh after some beautiful times on LSD in the woods of some National Park in my neighbor country. Shoes of the feet, carpets of the moss, the trees, the stream, my mind and what I experience thanks to him. I may criticize culture, but without it, without the media I would never get to know about lsd at all. I there wasn&#039;t any civilization I would probably take substances in natural way like every tribe did, but... It is good that civilization has points that help to make it better. Name Ram Dass sounds very religious itself too, I will check :) Internet, ah... internet...^^

				Okay, back again.... gshamen thank you, yeah, filling the experience book growing up on the East Coast, definitely some good times.&nbsp; GD playing 25 times a year within &quot;reasonable&quot; driving distance,&nbsp; Allan Ginsburg gave a reading/squeezebox performance at my college, Abbie Hoffman spoke there also while i was there, shit, MDMA was legal still, that wonderful time between rediculous availability and sudden prohibition.&nbsp; I&#039;ll bet Central Europe has its moments also, u can take a train to the Netherlands, nice! McKenna was just one of many of the Community that are now gone....shit, Bear just got killed not too long ago in an auto accident!&nbsp; I remember going to the shows where certain folks were selling his SYF belt buckles, one time he came up with a little case full of other pins medallions in precious metal he made.... made me start taking lessons working silver and gold!&nbsp; Never had a chance to thank him all these years later...

				Some wise words Chernabog, I had to think about it for a moment, if i got a person, who I don&#039;t agree about anything. Hard task! Still nothing ;) I liked the video very much. All of it.<br />The Scarecrow, LiquiFried&nbsp; I write down queue of the books I got to read. Books you mentioned are on it. Of course, I know about Food of the Gods and have read samples, heard samples and ideas from it, but the whole book... There are so many of them to read! My life is too short! AAAa!<br />It is a very possible with the US gov thing. There are just SO MANY horrible things it does secretly... F**ing imperialism! It is just disgusting. How it spills the blood of the innocent and the good for money...

				I really do learn a lot of new things about American culture thanks to you LiquiFried :)<br />I was gonna ask you about the Bear but I just checked myself, didn&#039;t know much about Grateful Dead either! But now I know how this belts look like, I know about him and his hand made jewellery. I know few new things and I&#039;m glad.<br />The times you write, when I imagine them...magic. The community.. Of course, the times are different than mine, I am younger, that is, what the whole phenomenon is based on, but still...Allen Ginsberg! On your own eyes and ears! Maaan! :D I love the Howl, it is a mistake and a shame I know only Howl too... But I love it. MDMA for me a second choice after psychedelics! Or even equal maybe! Miracle drug! Especially combined with LSD ^^ Well, In the communism law they haven&#039;t even heard of such a things and that was partially positive in that times. Also, for example complete lack of industrial breeding of animals, lots of things. Just...separation to the West and cons of the West too. Heh, but I still haven&#039;t a chance to live in these times, I was born shortly after the fall of the iron curtain. I havent been to Netherlands, but I adore Czech Republic. Great drug law too. And funny culture, gives me a warm smile on my face :))
