				Hi all,<br /><br />I am new here, trying to sell some high quality coke!<br /><br />Here is my Silkroad vendor link:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/57e4e49d72<br /><br />--NO MORE FREE COCAINE SAMPLES -- SOLD OUT --<br /><br />Now two questions:<br /><br />1) How do i initialize the free samples, so that people can leave me FEEDBACK for it on my seller&#039;s page, so future buyers have more trust in me. There first has to be something bought before i can receive feedback right?<br /><br />2) How do i get to post in all the other sections??<br /><br />Cheers to everyone! As soon as i have these 2 questions answered, i will send FREE 100mg lines of cocaine to respectable members, that are willing to leave some positive feedback for it on my page. And trust me, you will highly enjoy sniffing this coke, it&#039;s such a pleasant nice buzz.<br /><br />PS: If anyone has any tips for me, the starting online seller, feel free to tell them&nbsp; :D

				Regarding question #1.<br /><br />Setup a custom listing for your samplers so they can add the listing to the cart this will mimic a transaction allowing them to leave feedback for your account.

				I got a sample of this, but I&#039;m not sure what to think of it.<br />in all fairness, this is due my limited experience with (non-street) coke.<br />euphoria was okay and very smooth comedown, so I can only assume its atleast fairly clean.<br />but what bothers me is the unusual taste... <br />I was hoping someone with more coke-experience then me,<br />or maybe IMB himself could clear this up.<br />another vendor&#039;s coke was labtested on 72% and had the gasoline smell and taste I&#039;m used to,<br />so me never having good C before is not an argument.
