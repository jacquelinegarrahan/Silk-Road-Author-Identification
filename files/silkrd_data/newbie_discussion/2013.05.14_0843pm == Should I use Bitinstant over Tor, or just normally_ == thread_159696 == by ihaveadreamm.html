				The reason I ask is because I&#039;m thinking that I should just use my real name and email address for Bitinstant. I guess the coins will eventually be untraceable.<br /><br />My concerns:<br /><br />- Filling out the Moneygram will require the email address I used on Bitinstant. If I use a tormail account, this may appear suspicious. Do they require your email address?<br /><br />- Walmart may ask for my ID. I&#039;d prefer to use a fake name, but I don&#039;t want to find myself in a sketchy situation.<br /><br />- Using Bitinstant over Tor with my real info could potentially give away my identity.<br /><br />Any suggestions?<br /><br />

				Buying bitcoins is legal just make sure you wash them before sending to SR. The SR tumbler will also mix them up a bit but for the extra paranoid you can move them around as much as you&#039;d like.

				I haven&#039;t been asked to show ID or give email address for a bitinstant moneygram transaction. All you&#039;ve gotta do at the store is pick up the moneygram phone, enter the details bitinstant gives you, and then pay for it at the counter with cash and sign. There shouldn&#039;t be any forms involved. <br /><br />I use my real name and email for bitinstant,&nbsp; send the coins to my blockchain wallet, and usually directly from there to SR. If you&#039;re concerned you can use blockchain&#039;s &quot;Shared Send&quot; feature for a 0.5% fee and it will further hide your identity.

				<br />I used bitinstant to fund my account but I did have to use &quot;the blue form.&quot; They didn&#039;t have the red phone. Also, if the name that you put in when you generate your bitinstant pay slip has to match the name you give them on the form or it won&#039;t go through.No ID required though, so you can just make up a name and address.<br /><br />The only drawback to that is that if there did happen to be a problem with that transfer, you would need ID to get it fixed.<br />

				Thanks for the replies guys. I do have one last question.<br /><br />Do you guys fill out the Bitinstant form over Tor, or do you do it over a normal browser? <br /><br />It seems if I use my real info, I should probably do it over the clearnet as to create a gap between my identity and my doings over the Tor network.

				<br /><br />I did it normally. Bitinstant only asks for a name, and I used a bogus one. Not saying that&#039;s how you should do it, that&#039;s just how I did it. I suppose if you wanted to go through Tor, it wouldn&#039;t hurt anything to do that, and if it makes you feel better, I say go for it.

				If you actually have to fill out that form they do. They do not however, check that address. I&#039;m just going to look around at all of the places that offer the MoneyGram (I think that&#039;s what it was) service and find the red phone for the next one. That sounds like the way to go to me.<br /><br />

				Just to be clear, do I need to use a real email address on Bitinstant? It asks for email for notification, first and last name, plus date of birth. Should I use an actual tormail account for the email if I use a fake name?<br /><br />For some reason I&#039;d feel safer using a real name, but it seems like it could draw connections. Using my real name on clearnet, and then transferring to a blockchain wallet created on Tor draws a connection.<br /><br />Is my best bet to use Bitinstant over clearnet with real info, and transfer to a blockchain wallet created over Tor? I will use the Fog before I transfer to the SR.<br /><br />

				<br />I can only tell you what I did. What you do is up to you. For the email address, I used my Tormail address. I DID NOT use my real name or address during any step of the process. I did however, access bitinstant and print the pay slip using regular clearnet.<br /><br />Bit Instant is not where I had any trouble. The one best piece of advice I can give you is to make sure you change your&nbsp; password and pin, no matter how secure you might think your account is before you fund your SR account, and memorize the SR address so you can always type it in manually. <br />
