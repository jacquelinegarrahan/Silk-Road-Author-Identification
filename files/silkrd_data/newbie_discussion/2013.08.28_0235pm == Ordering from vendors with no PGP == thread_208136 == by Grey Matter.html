				So I&#039;m looking into placing my first order soon, &amp; the one thing that&#039;s getting to me is seemingly the top 2 vendors for the product I want simple do not have PGP setup. It&#039;s sketching me out sending my address through plaintext, and from what I&#039;ve read privnote doesn&#039;t seem to be all that secure.<br /><br />Am I being scary for no reason or should I be wary of sending my address through privnote / plaintext? Is there anything I can do using either of those methods to feel a bit more secure? Is sending plaintext through SR relatively secure, and is privnote trustworthy / secure? <br /><br />Thanks for the help guys.

				If a vendor can&#039;t be bothered to put the time into learning PGP to ensure its customers safety I would question using that vendor.<br /><br />Sending it non PGP is a concern for sure

				It&#039;s really strange because the 2 vendors I&#039;m speaking of are clearly the top 2 vendors for the product I want. If I had guidance PGP would&#039;ve taken me all of 2 minutes to learn, just figuring it out on my own took all of 30 minutes. (Not to insult their intelligence, by any means)<br /><br />I just don&#039;t want to get a lower quality product for the sole reason that the vendor(s) I want to go through aren&#039;t able to accept PGP messages. =\

				When I first used SR I sent my address without PGP maybe 10 times. Nothing ever came of it though. After the whole Tor Mail situation recently showing the LE clearly have tactics to obtain data sent on the Tor-Network, not encrypting your address could lead to problems, probably not in all honesty, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />If these vendors have what you want, have good feedback, I would suggest contacting them by PM and asking about there PGP... you dont need to encrypt every PM (in my opinion) you send on SR, just any PM containing sensitive data.

				Aye, these vendors have damn near flawless feedback. &amp; I appreciate the advice, I have been conversing with them through PM&#039;s regarding my potential order. Sadly the last message sent to both of them was regarding PGP and they seemed to have been offline by the time I got around to sending it. <br /><br />Here&#039;s to hoping they&#039;ve got PGP up and running, just not readily available on their vendor page. :P

				I have been wondering about this too...<br />PGP is definitely an extra blanket of security, but your personal details are only held in Escrow until the vendor accepts your order, and then they are deleted. The only risk is if hackers or the authorities happen to get into silk road while your order is still processing, cause your name and addy will still be in the system. So its unlikely youre gonna get screwed not using it, but its a better safe than sorry thing I guess.<br />Privnote is not secure at all and has been known to pass details to authorities - you might as well just send your address to the feds and let them know what your up to.
