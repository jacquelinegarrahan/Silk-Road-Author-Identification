				Post your stuff here that you know no one will give a shit about!<br /><br />It&#039;s most likely something that no one gives a shit about and I realize that. Nevertheless, I&#039;m posting it anyway. Why? I have no idea why. I just thought it was something to do while I was bored. Plus, it helps my brain to tinker on other irrelevant things when I have been working my ass off and I need a break for a while. Yep, I&#039;ve been working my ass off lately and my brain needed a break so I put this together. <br /><br />It&#039;s a disclaimer I put together from other crap I found here and there plus a tiny bit of stuff I actually created on my own (Again, I know that no one gives a shit).<br /><br />Here&#039;s my disclaimer (that no one cares about):<br /><br />..........................................<br /><br />Disclaimer<br /><br />All content provided on this forum post is for informational purposes only. SirNomDePlum makes no representations as to the accuracy, reliability or completeness of any information in this content or information/content found by following any link in this post. <br /><br />SirNomDePlum will not be liable for any errors or omissions in this information nor for the availability of this information. SirNomDePlum will not be liable for any losses, injuries, or damages from the display or use of this information.<br /><br />By selecting any of these links, you will be visiting the CLEARNET. SirNomDePlum has provided these links because they may have (or might not have) information that would be of interest to you. No inferences should be drawn on account of other sites being referenced, or not, from this page. There may be other web sites that are more appropriate for your purpose. SirNomDePlum does not necessarily endorse the views expressed, or concur with the facts presented on these sites. Further, SirNomDePlum does not endorse any commercial products that may be mentioned on these sites.<br /><br />Please feel free to discuss the content/information provided here using the dialectical method. The term dialectics is not synonymous with the term debate. The term dialectics is also not synonymous with the term rhetoric, a method or art of discourse that seeks to persuade, inform, or motivate an audience. Concepts, like rational appeal, emotional appeal, and ethical appeal, are intentionally used by rhetoricians to persuade an audience.&nbsp; SirNomDePlum favors truth as the highest value, proposing that it could be discovered through reason and logic in discussion: ergo, dialectic.<br /><br />SirNomDePlum values rationality (appealing to logic, not emotion) as the proper means for persuasion, the discovery of truth, and the determinant for one&#039;s actions. To SirNomDePlum, truth is the greater good, and each person should, above all else, seek truth to guide one&#039;s life.<br /><br />Remember, the goal in dialectics should NEVER be to win (like it is in many government political circles when they “debate”). Instead, the goal should be to get to the truth of some issue and to learn something new, not to prove that one person is right over another (that’s ego). If you find that you are wrong then please happily admit it and relish in the fact that we, as a community (including you), just learned something new. <br /><br />If you’re looking for an original thought or idea please look elsewhere. Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I&#039;ve ever known and of anyone and anything in the complete history of the universe. If you think you have an original idea please feel free to share it with us. An original idea shouldn’t be too hard. The library must be full of them.<br /><br />When posting please feel free to include, if you must, ejaculations, fecks, cognates and false cognates, catchphrases and eggcorns to make your point. <br /><br />But please try and refrain from bollockspeak, confabulations, humbugs, waffling, mondegreens, codswallop, malapropisms, hogswallop, a mumpsimus, smart-ass comments, dumb-ass comments or being the Gombeen man.<br /><br />Or else I may have to call BULLSHIT - bovine excrement or, more commonly, &quot;nonsense.” <br /><br />Don’t know what it means? Look it up.<br /><br />.....................................................................<br /><br />Have any other stuff that no one gives a shit about? Feel free to post it here.<br />

				There have been many historical events which were influenced or directly caused by people giving a shit or not giving a shit:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A fucking long time ago - The universe is created in an explosion of light, heat, energy and gravity forming the basis of the bullshit we know today as physics. No (american) gives a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 65 million years ago - The dinosaurs get wiped out by some freak meteor or something. None of the dinosaurs give a shit, cos they&#039;re all dead. None of the mammals give a shit either cos the dinosaurs ate their aunties.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 10000 BC - First human takes a shit. Nobody gives a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 58 BC - Julius Caesar doesn&#039;t give a shit and decides to invade Gaul.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 44 BC - Several Roman Senators conspire to kill Julius Caesar. They are successful.

Europe doesn&#039;t give a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000 AD - Earth has officially lasted 1000 years since the birth of that one guy who died in 36 AD, but nobody really gives a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1066 AD Some French arsehole invades some country or other. The world goes on, living happily with the fact that they didn&#039;t give a shit, and never will.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1111 AD - The year 1111 is a year that can be read backwards and forwards, as well as upside down. Not many people gave a shit though.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1337 AD - Also known as the 1337 year, no one but n00bs gives a shit though.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1492 AD - Christopher Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; America. Native Americans didn&#039;t really give a shit at the time.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1775 AD - The United States starts a revolution against Britain.

The American Civil War starts. The North doesn&#039;t give a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1912 AD - A particular iceberg in the Northern Atlantic is mad and sinks the RMS Titanic as a result. 1,500 people die.

World War I starts.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1939 AD - Germany doesn&#039;t give a shit about the Treaty of Versailles. World War II starts. The US doesn&#039;t give a shit until later on.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1944 AD - A mozillion Jews get killed in the Holocaust. People give a shit and they haven&#039;t shut the fuck up about it yet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1945 AD - Atoms don&#039;t give a shit and start to split.

God is impressed, but &quot;End of the World&quot; theorists are worried. So is Prince, because it&#039;s not 1999 anymore. But other than that, nobody gave a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2001 AD - Hundreds of people die in a horrific terrorist attack. The U.S. makes sure EVERYONE gives a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2006 AD - Sony releases the PS3. But because it&#039;s so fucking overpriced, nobody gives a shit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2012 AD - The year where everybody is supposed to die, and nobody gives a shit (or maybe not).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2013 AD - You are reading this. This is significant in that nobody gives a shit about you.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2092 AD - It is predicted that somebody in the future will give or not give a shit about some yet-to-happen event. <br /><br />

				Someone was taking a hallucinatory journey and said&nbsp; ...<br /><br />The BEST kind of mushrooms are psilocybin containing because they make the world go stranger than those Windows Media Player visualizations. They are known to allow buildings to breathe, cars to talk, and you to be funny. One time I ate some of these shrooms and it was like... whoa... I can see my hands... shrooms glow pretty colors... whoa you guys the walls are breathing and time is going really slow...and that pencil you drop is floating for an eternity! How long has it been anyways??? What is happening? Who are you? Who am I? What the hell? I want my mommy! I want my dada! This shit has been going on forever! HOLY MOTHER FUCK!!! Wahhh!!!<br /><br />The fairy circles encountered me suddenly. The fountainhead went into my brain, and I became Neo. Mr. Black told me that red was really blue and that they lied to me. Adam saw a tee shirt moving, but I think he was lying.<br /><br />If you weigh 80kg, About 2.5kg dried Psilocybe cubensis will probably kill you, as they absorb water, swell and cause your stomach to explode, covering your friends in blood and intestines. Anyone nearby risks injury from bone fragments etc. If you have a very, very, very large stomach, eating 15kg will cause your mind to implode and possibly destroy the universe. <br /><br />They keep telling me that I&#039;m not seeing what I think I&#039;m seeing, but I don&#039;t think they realize that THEY&#039;RE ALL OVER ME!!!! GET THEM OFF!!!! The little voices in your head may be verbal hallucinations or could just be that some secret government agency has slipped broadcasting units in to your head via your breakfast cereal. Besides this place smells like cheese.<br />......................<br /><br />I am the eggman! They are the eggmen! I am the Walrus, goo goo g&#039;joob!

				It&#039;s hard to really look at somebody and go: &quot;Hey, maybe something nice will happen.&quot; You just don&#039;t-- I know too much about life to have any optimism, because I know even if it&#039;s nice, it&#039;s going to lead to shit. I know that if you smile at somebody and they smile back, you&#039;ve just decided that something shitty is going to happen.
