				Always ship to your real name and a real address.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with either option - private residence or a legit PO Box.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t try to get all shady with fake names, abandoned addresses, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />The fundamental idea is to hide in plain sight.&nbsp; It just looks like another piece of mail in the system.<br /><br />If you can make sure you get a high volume of legal packages, that certainly helps.&nbsp; Buy your groceries on Amazon for example.<br /><br />Try to avoid getting a lot of packages from foreign countries if possible.&nbsp; If you stick with domestic you are much less conspicuous.<br /><br />Always use PGP for your address!

				Privnote is considered pretty dodgy and unsecure by alot of people so definetly read more into it before using it. <br />PGP is not that difficult and much safer.

In terms of the P.O box what I do is I open them with fake ID. They usually require two forms of ID to open depending on where you live but you can hustle them only into one ID. Either way you can get both on SR, then just open up a box and sign up for free magazines online etc. then you got yourself a p. legit p.o box.
