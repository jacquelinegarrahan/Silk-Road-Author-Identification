				Is it right to take revenge on people or persons who have wronged you in the past?<br />I am contemplating some revengeful acts....thats a lie...in my minds eye i have already commited these acts....<br />my heart burns when i think of the shit people do and have done....<br />that they think they can get away with because the society has laws....<br /><br />In my code of ethics their are certain things that the law of the land has no jurisdiction over....<br />am i an anarchist? no and yes....well i belong to no group...<br />but i feel people who are oppressed and wronged severely have the right to retaliate by any means necessary ...<br />am i being emotional?<br /><br />what if someone harmed your family.....<br />or your kids....<br />is revenge right in these instances....or should we wait for the law to take its course....<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe in the courts...police or judges...<br />I follow my own law or code of ethics....<br />i treat all people with full respect, regardless of race, sexuality, disability.....<br />I really do......and when someone takes advantage or takes kindness for weakness to the extreme...i explode...<br /><br />starting to sound like a vigilante....<br />oh and if we do take revenge is that us acting out in the name of karma....thanx people...

				Agree with every thing you said, do what you want, you shouldent let some old fucker tell you what to do and make your descions for you. And yeah I belive in revenge especially if its something to do with family. That crosses the line.

				Sounds like this person/people are wrecking your peace.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t let them do that.&nbsp; It&#039;s instinct to want to destroy what hurts you.&nbsp; But it&#039;s devine to move above that (and no easy fucking task either). <br /><br />I believe there are certain truths, and you reap what you sow is one of them.&nbsp; The Universe will take care of the assholes.&nbsp; It may not be in your time, but they will get theirs&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t let them take your peace.&nbsp; Love the ones you love fiercely, and let that be your revenge.&nbsp; <br /><br />Easier said than done.&nbsp; But my three cents (cuz history owes me one).

				&#039;an eye for an eye turns the whole world blind&#039; gandhi<br />it&#039;s up to you really, i&#039;d say it depends on what they did to you. if you can let go of the bitterness sometimes that&#039;s the best thing to do.<br />sounds more like you&#039;re talking about terrorism or civil disobedience though, they have their places... not that i support terrorism or anything, i can just see where they&#039;re coming from.

I&#039;d say stop him.&nbsp; &nbsp; For the betterment of the world, the society in general, you&#039;re doing an altruistic service.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like what is justice supposed to be?... that&#039;s what it&#039;s supposed to be, right?&nbsp; For the betterment of society, people that don&#039;t live by the accepted role of conduct, are accordingly punished.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kinda OT: Now Lady Justice/Justitia is blind... she didn&#039;t have the blindfold until the 15th century or something ...&nbsp; people seem to think that blindfold means &quot;objectivity&quot;.&nbsp; Well, then why didn&#039;t she originally have the blindfold on to begin with?&nbsp; Why is she mostly depicted these days having the scales of truth and fairness tilted?&nbsp; If she&#039;s objective, wouldn&#039;t the scales be equal?... like the gods/previous personifications before her.&nbsp; &nbsp;How is she to see if that things are weighted properly if she&#039;s blindfolded?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t believe in the courts...police or judges...<br />I follow my own law or code of ethics....<br />i treat all people with full respect, regardless of race, sexuality, disability.....<br />I really do......and when someone takes advantage or takes kindness for weakness to the extreme...i explode...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m with ya... the system is clearly broken.&nbsp; Like Plate said&nbsp; “Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws.”&nbsp; If the system is so broken that we cannot live within it, we have no choice but to live outside it... just like the &quot;bad&quot; people.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since they&#039;re the ones running the system anyhow.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying all vengeance is justified...&nbsp; I mean if it&#039;s for some petty crap to which serves no other purpose than the mere pleasure.&nbsp; Well, idk if that&#039;s so righteous.&nbsp; If you can live with it, if you can ensure that no other is inadvertently affected, well then it may be ok.&nbsp; That&#039;s all up to you. Everything is case by case.<br /><br />TL;DR&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Everything&#039;s fucked.&nbsp; Sometimes revenge is justified.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				1,You could just let it go, <br />2, you could the route of&nbsp; Jules in Pulp Fiction:<br /><br />&quot;The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother&#039;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.&quot;<br /><br />Personally I like the second option<br />

				It may have been said already, but when you let what someone has done, evil though it may be consume you so completely, are they not controlling you? Revenge in<br />a spur of the moment self defense situation is one thing, but plotting and thinking on it for extended time is not good for you. As many here have already pointed out,<br />it is best to move on... <br />Peace
