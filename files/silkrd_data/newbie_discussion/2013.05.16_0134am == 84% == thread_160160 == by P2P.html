				Can we stop with this shit already? It&#039;s 100% MDMA HCl. Just like your powdered cocaine (which vendors advertise as 99.9/99/100% pure) is Cocaine HCl. What is the purpose for perpetuating this?

				In pure HCL salt MDMA, the MDMA volume is 84% of the total weight/volume and the HCL salt occupies the other 16%.<br /><br />100% if you&#039;d like.<br /><br />But chemically it&#039;s 84%.<br /><br />Street-wise etc. it&#039;s 100% because it&#039;s the maximum achievable purity for MDMA HCL.<br /><br />Of course, Shulgin&#039;s advice on dosages are for pure MDMA, so it&#039;s more correct to say 84%, chemically and for dosage purposes. So if you have 100 mg, you will have ~84 mg of pure MDMA. And go from there ^_^

It doesn&#039;t change the fact, though, that it&#039;s 100% MDMA HCl<br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of it being dosed in any other form. Unless there have been individuals that have gulped down liquid MDMA base (although this seems dangerous unless you have beakers/grad cylinders in your home to verify the volume and convert that to mass via the known density of MDMA).

				Freebase mdma? Powder?<br /><br />Ehh, the people who use 84% are probably chemists :)

				just not true.<br /><br />84% is ACCURATE.<br /><br />it&#039;s a salt, not a base.<br /><br />end of story.

				Those are the standards of comparison. And if we started with 84%, 100% is just more confusing.<br /><br />Plus, it&#039;s chemically correct to say 84%.<br /><br />The freebase form which is a powder I think, that one has 100%.

Sellers don&#039;t need to be selling their MDMA products as 84% pure for the sake of some claim to chemical integrity. Neither is necessarily better than the other; I&#039;m just confused as to why the 84% mark gained diffusion, since 100% just looks and sounds so much better from a marketing perspective. Maybe it&#039;s some kind of a mindfuck - giving the buyer the impression that the seller is trustworthy because they will report the exact percentage of what it is the buyer wants within the sample - the problem is, they&#039;re missing what really matters i.e. the concentrations of the different isomers within the racemic mixture of MDMA. Hence why this pathetic attempt at precision is just foolhardy on the dealer&#039;s part.
