				karma is a pretty useless feature built into forum software. members with 100+ posts can give you positive or negative karma for your posts and the score will appear next your username. the fact however is that most people with high positive karma got theirs from the +karma thread (give +1 to me and i will do the same for you) not for writing useful posts

				Weeeellll it&#039;s stupid, and it doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br /><br />But, if your a generally pleasant person you get positive karma. If you&#039;re just an asshole you get negative karma. You can give karma when you hit the 100 post count. Don&#039;t be lame and go to the +karma thread to get positive karma though, I&#039;m pretty sure anyone who posts in there gets a lot of negative karma from random peeps.

				thank you for asking the question, and the answers fellas, i was wondering whats up with this option ...<br /><br />another thing, lets say i vendor is looking at your post to research your reputation on the forum and the vendor spotted the karma scale under your name and wanted to check where did you get your negative karma from, would he be linked to the post or the user that gave you the negative karma or positive karma !?

				No, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to hunt down the exact people who give you positive/negative karma or the exact post from where you got it. So it&#039;s a free for all sort of thing. But, you can&#039;t repeat giving karma for 72 hours(something like that?) on one user. So it&#039;s all cool chilly I guess sort of not really but you know.<br />+ for you guys, tread the roads softly<br />
