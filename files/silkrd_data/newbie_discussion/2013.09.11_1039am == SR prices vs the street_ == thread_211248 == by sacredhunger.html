				Hey guys,<br /><br />Just wondering what you all think of the prices on SR vs what you can get on the street. Now obvs you pay a bit more for the convenience of sitting on your ass at home, but I&#039;m thinking some of the prices still look quite high! <br /><br />Weed in particular, I&#039;m seeing listings of not immensely high grade stuff for £35 an 1/8. <br /><br />Is that just standard, and should I accept that I&#039;m going to pay significantly more for mail order narcotics??

				Low amounts of weed are not cheap, especially in the UK. However SR fees are relatively higher on smaller orders.<br /><br />You can find some good deals though. A bit of research and I&#039;m paying street prices but getting Alien Grade, or I&#039;m buying a few grams more and getting still very good stuff but at a cheaper price than the street.<br /><br />The thing is pretty much anyone can grow weed, lot of it being grown locally around the world, so SR isn&#039;t really necessary. But quality MDMA rocks? Top-end Dutch pills? LSD? These things can be VERY hard to source locally. For this SR is essential.<br />

Perhaps this is a factor in the pricing. I feel edibles and condensed plant material (i.e. hash, hash oil) would be best to buy on SR.<br /><br />Regarding other drugs. I know that MDMA in my area is an average of 0.08251 BTC a hit (1mg) when many vendors on SR are selling MDMA for as low as 0.02490 BTC a hit. That&#039;s an 80% difference. I enjoy MDMA and I plan on making a nice purchase. Keeping half to myself and saving half to sell so that I can break even and come back to SR for more goodies.

				Triple-sealed vac packing with Mylar is pretty common... and pretty cheap to be honest... absolutely no smell gets through even from the strongest Alien grade weed.<br /><br />I usually order 5g to 7g of weed and they&#039;ve all been fine. Had 20g arrive without problems too.

				Yeah, just looking now actually MDMA looks pretty good value on here. The only thing is whether to believe the sellers when they say its 88% pure etc...! <br /><br />I see you&#039;ve used TechnoHippy Rocknessie? Seems quite highly rated - good stuff??&nbsp; :o

				MDMA seems much cheaper. Cocaine, adderall, much more expensive. Weed seems to be reasonable but you can get it cheaper if you&#039;re in a legal/medical state. So I guess there&#039;s not a blanket answer... just depends what you&#039;re looking for and where you live.

				On the contraire, I find The prices a lot better than the dtreets when buying big quantities. I dont think I would find the same prices anywhere else.<br />Thanks SR!

I can buy 15g for the price of about 6g here. It is not even that bad. But when you smoke it you know that you will never want to go back to the in comparison shitty street stuff.

				It&#039;s true prices are a little high, especially as far as I&#039;m concerned —the heroine. It is also true that on the street until 10 years ago taking 1 gram of heroin for $ 50, while now spend 50 and pick up garbage. I try always white but the prices are exorbitant

				Its simple. SR = High Prices on Products with high Demand. Street = Lower Prices but lower Quality and lesser diversion of Products available.

				In my city is so hard to find LSD and dealers never have it. When they do it goes like dust, so quick... and if you happen to get a tab sometimes the quality sucks, and its a few euro more expensive than SR. So at least that product is generally cheaper!! And guaranteed quality on the road ;)
