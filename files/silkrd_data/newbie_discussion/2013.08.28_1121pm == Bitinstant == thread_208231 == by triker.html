				Since I started using Silk Road I have always used BitInstant to buy bitcoins.&nbsp; Since they have been down so long I need to buy some coins pretty soon.&nbsp; Now I am having a hard time figuring which new system to use since there are so many scams.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a similar means to buy bitcoins as the set up in BitInstant.&nbsp; I have a Mt Gox account but the hoops they put you through if using a corporate checking account are unmatched in paper work.&nbsp; There must be an easier way.&nbsp; I am sure someone else has asked about this so I apologize for any redundancy.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I need to know.&nbsp; Help please.

				I have done very well with coinbase -- but in all fairness I am only on my second purchase.<br /><br />They take several days of float time prior to crediting my wallet, but their rates are very good and my transfer to SR was literally accomplished within 10 minutes.

				You may have heard it a lot by now, but the best way is localbitcoins. Hands down. Why anyone would use an exchange for SR now is beyond me. It&#039;s way faster, you can get a far better deal, and it can be done totally anonymously, in cash. No way I&#039;m giving my tax return to Mt. Gox or providing my real info so I can get BTC to buy drugs with. The feds are taking a great interest in BTC and the main bitcoin players are more than eager to cooperate. Here&#039;s one very recent example: http://www.thebitcoinchannel.com/archives/21790. Buy that shit for cash!

				I know it&#039;s not recommended because it&#039;s done out of escrow, but I have a couple BTC vendors right on the Road that I use pretty regular . They transfer your BTC&#039;s right into your account from theirs and it very quick, ya don&#039;t have to wait the hours it sometimes take to transfer from an outside wallet to your Road wallet. It can be risky though as , like I said, it&#039;s outside the Roads escrow.

				I wouldnt trust Bitinstant anymore after their last couple of mishaps, which in all honesty was more like a selective scam than some technical errors in their part. They still owe me several BTCs and even after reporting them as a scam and posting about it in Bitcointalk, they still refuse to even answer any of my messages. Fucking scamming pricks.

I think what happened really was they lost their shorts during the crash and didn&#039;t want to honor pending transactions. Did you contact Zipmark? Most bitinstant transactions processed through them and they should be able to get your money back if so.

				Hello, Triker, and welcome - from one noob to another :-) Don&#039;t worry about redundancy; we all need to know the same stuff to operate effectively and securely in this environment and some of us walk in with that know-how and others don&#039;t. I sure didn&#039;t and I feel like I&#039;m only beginning to master the operational basics of working safely within an explicitly clandestine community. <br /><br />That said - I&#039;m essentially replying to add my voice to most of the other responses posted here. I deal *STRICTLY ANONYMOUSLY* in acquiring BTC as a matter of preference and I found the contact I needed on localbitcoin. [Not to put too fine a point on the obvious, but - good judgment is always a good idea, savvy? Regarding people, transactions, business, etc. ad nauseam.] My &quot;go to&quot; BTC contact has been in the biz for a long time and is a fan of canbx [sp?] and coinbase; however, that individual&#039;s interests are primarily dictated by potential profits. Basically, what you want to do with your BTC should tell you a great deal about how you should acquire them, etc. <br /><br />Because - as noted - SR is by definition a clandestine community, going the extra mile to acquire BTC anonymously is probably strongly advisable. On the other hand, I know there are some sites/companies out there who are trying to make a go of BTC mixing/laundering in order to fuzz a trail that is AT ALL TIMEs COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE. The weak point in acquiring BTC is purchasing them - if you do so under your own public identity, then your trail is identified from the get go...does that make sense? If a worst case scenario should occur - *shudder* - it WILL NOT MATTER to the LEOs that you were only patronizing SR to buff out your library, capisce? Be very careful about separating your &quot;public&quot; BTC identity from your private one; keeping a *dedicated* tricked out darknet/security+/anonymized machine is not a bad idea at all. [My own personal project over the next couple of months; some useful tools for such an undertaking can be purchased right here on SR. :-)] In any event....most of us are persuaded that Bitinstant is dead as canasta despite their assurances of a comeback, blather, sure. [Maybe we&#039;ll be proven wrong; who knows?] Regardless, good luck to you....and if you insist on spending non-anonymized BTC on SR, please, PLEASE - for YOUR sake and OURS - do the tech research necessary to inform yourself about mixing. Plenty of techs hang out in the fora and many of them are very approachable and free with their knowledge. Take care, stay safe, and be well. :-)

				PS - Brief addendum to last post. If memory serves, coinbase requires members to jump through the same kinds of hoops as Mt Gox - including extensive personal identification. There are some real benefits that come with membership - for a legit vendor, say. But for someone who wants to spend their BTC anonymously....well, in my estimation, the only feasible way to use coinbase would be to a)become an anonymous vendor [legit] b) sell and trade your stock with others who deal anonymously, c) make sure that when you have finally acquired &quot;clean&quot; BTC that you store them somewhere ANONYMOUS. [Cold storage is also recommended against the failure of wallet apps/sites/companies. I was reading about ninjastiks the other day; they sounded pretty interesting.] <br /><br />Again, good luck! :-)

				Try JumboMonkeyBuscuit out I haven&#039;t used them myself, but many reputable vendors have given them amazing reviews. They accept cash and other methods for payment. I myself buy my btc locally through cash exchange, but give JMB a try.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/75803901ae
