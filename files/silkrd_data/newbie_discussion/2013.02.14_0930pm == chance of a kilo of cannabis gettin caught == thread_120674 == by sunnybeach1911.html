				Chance of getting caught? Depends on a few things:<br /><br />1. How well its packaged (basically whether it stinks or not)<br />2. Where its coming from (i.e. are you importing it? US to UK). <br />3. The Shipping method (State ran vs. DHL/UPS/FedEx)<br /><br />Now, if its packaged really well, that certainly reduces the risk.&nbsp; But not all that much if its being imported. Customs agencies in many countries do in fact use drug dogs with packages being imported.&nbsp; They just walk up and down the row of packages and wait for a signal from the dog.&nbsp; Of course, the chances of having a dog would be higher if the package is coming from areas known for drug trafficking, e.g. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran (heroin), India (lots of pharma&#039;s, also heroin, opium, ketamine, etc..), anywhere in South America (cocaine/heroin) and of course the golden triangle (Thailand, Myanmar, Laos - heroin). If its coming from the US, there&#039;s likely less of a chance that the dogs will be present, but its still certainly a good chance.&nbsp; This is where the shipping method comes in. <br /><br />Shipping method - State ran postal services (USPS, Royal Mail, Canada Post) have far fewer resources than say, a FedEx or UPS.&nbsp; So the chances of the package being thoroughly checked is much less than with a FedEx, DHL or UPS.&nbsp; They certainly still check them, but its generally random, not as extensive, and is therefore much easier to get things through.&nbsp; Not the case with FedEx for instance.&nbsp; They&#039;re really good at checking parcels.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;- Section deleted by EternalSunshineMan (this part was too risky to keep posted) - <br /><br />Anyway, if you&#039;re not importing it, I&#039;d say there&#039;s very little risk (I won&#039;t import anything anymore).&nbsp; If you are, just make sure you don&#039;t sign for anything at all.&nbsp; And if you get the package to your house, sit on it for at least 24 hours before opening it.&nbsp; Remember, plausible deniability&nbsp; - &quot;no officer, I had no idea there was a key of bud in that package, who could have sent that to me?&quot; If its not open, and you don&#039;t sign for it, you can deny you had anything to do with it.&nbsp; If they do set you up, they&#039;ll come after you immediately, so 24 hours should be plenty of time to sit on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope that helps

				Feedmeplease thinks it would be stupid to have the whole key sent at once, split in to smaller packages and you should be safer

				a kilo isn&#039;t really that hard to ship with out getting caught. i&#039;ve recieved orders of 6 pounds in one box. the biggest factor is how it&#039;s packaged. if they do it right(ziploc bag to prevent too much flatening and triple-quadruple vacuum seal, then you&#039;re safe

				I&#039;m getting it from the dreaded netherlands :P.<br />Been getting 100+g no problem well sealed and very stealth.<br />As for breaking it up into smaller amounts.<br />It&#039;s advertised as 1kg and is prepacked so no chance of getting it split up.<br />The vendor is djabbar and going by his feedback on any of his kilos none have been seized, all the feed back is 5/5

				<br /><br />So did you have the package sent to your job or your house? Just wondering why they went to your work and not the house. I&#039;m also surprised they never got a search warrant for your residence.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />I had it sent to my house (stupid, I know). They went there first, and when I wasn&#039;t there, they came to my work.&nbsp; Yeah they never pursued it any farther.&nbsp; I was very surprised myself.&nbsp; I know they interviewed a lot of the people I worked with and from what I understand they all claimed to not know anything, so they left that alone. If they don&#039;t do a controlled delivery, and you never acknowledge you had anything to do with the package being sent, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much they can do.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if maybe I shouldn&#039;t have told this story...I may actually delete my post if that&#039;s possible<br />

				Sorry guys, I deleted my story from the earlier post.&nbsp; After I posted it, I realized it could potentially be used by DEA to identify me.&nbsp; Paranoid? Yes.&nbsp; But just because you&#039;re paranoid, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not after you.&nbsp;

				Oh shit!&nbsp; daggles, can you delete that middle section of my quote from your post please? The part I deleted out?&nbsp; If you could, that would be great.&nbsp; I realized its kinda stupid to post a story like that.&nbsp; I&#039;m kicking myself right now...

				No problem bro.&nbsp; But now I&#039;m shitting myself.&nbsp; Hopefully daggles can delete that part of my post with the quickness.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the chances of anyone using that to figure out who I am actually is, but any chance is too much.&nbsp; Fuck my life

				Sent him one.&nbsp; Hopefully he reads it soon. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s 1000 people with my name where I live, but still its a risk I don&#039;t want to take. Even if/when something is delivered, I won&#039;t sign for it, and I&#039;ll sit on it for a day.&nbsp; So the chances are fairly low I think.&nbsp; Man I hate being paranoid
