				Anyone have any idea of what happened to sleepwhenyoudie? She made me a long series of broken promises then disappeared. My item was only a ten dollar pipe. Just wondering if anyone had heard from her.

				Well i would hate to think that. But she did completely drop off<br />&nbsp;What is the rationale or need for a vendor to go &quot;stealth&quot;<br />

				Paranoia, maybe she got pinched.&nbsp; Either way, I would call it a lost and if she suddenly tries to contact you again w/ awesome bargains or something fishy, always take into consideration, what is to stop a fed from using an account which has been seized to fish for more victims?&nbsp;

				Could be also a lot of people don&#039;t realize the expenses of vending online with all kinds of ebay like rules.&nbsp; You would def have to have better prices by your sources to vend here, as noted i could see that some things i can get by traditional means cost an arm, a leg, and a left nut, here on the SR.&nbsp; <br />Anyways, this starter cost and having to deal with the kinks of starting an online store is a pain in the ass that 90% of people drop out of, legal or not. <br /><br />Maybe said vendor found a responsible favorable custy and doesn&#039;t need SR services to further business and in order to serve properly.&nbsp; Hence them never answering.&nbsp; And the worst, imagine if a vendor get&#039;s locked out of his account one day, and says well fuck it, i&#039;m not forking over another $XXXX in order to re-establish myself and then have to go through all the shitty motions of becoming a preferred vendor back on spot, which i guess if they were into the forum would be easier to deal with, but not a lot of people really come to the forum to chat about vendor/custy relations right?&nbsp; <br /><br />Finally the scariest, as aforementioned.&nbsp; If LE got a hold of a computer, how good is their IT staff?
