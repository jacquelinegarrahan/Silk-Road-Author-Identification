				IRL often you&#039;ll just meet someone accidently due to &#039;synchronicity&#039;. <br /><br />In the meantime, why not just buy some off SR?

				Talk around. Meet people who smoke and get their trust enough that they will introduce you to their dealer. Assuming you live in the US, it&#039;s hard to find a person who doesn&#039;t smoke.

				Are you in college? That could make it pretty easy.<br /><br />Just go out to some bars, strike up some conversations and ease your way into it. <br />I wouldn&#039;t go out looking for people who look like dealers. Anyone and everyone smokes pot.<br />Try some local bars that might be popular with the college scene. <br />Local concerts? Music festivals? idk maybe search for some pot advocates in your area.<br />Just get out there and talk to people, you can&#039;t do it sittin behind your computer screen... Unless you just order weed from the silk road.

				Most colleges have a NORML chapter on their campus that is a very good area to start.

				Go to a place where lots of people in their 20s or late teens gather, and socialize. Casually bring up weed in a conversation, and if someone acts like a supporter of weed try to ask if they can hook you up. <br /><br />Alternatively, just do what you did where you lived before. (which I assume is pretty much what I wrote above, with slight alterations.)

				I usually kick it with someone for a little bit and if I wanna smoke, I ask, hey man, do you smoke and do the smoking a joint gesture with my fingers, they usually get it at that point and its not too noticeable.&nbsp; Then from there if they smoke they can probably find someone to hook you up.&nbsp; Silkroad is uber easy to use for bud, but nothing like a local connect.

				This is the easiest thing to find, IMO. I live in a working class neighborhood and everybody is smoking. Every time I walk down the street, that&#039;s all you smell. It&#039;s hard to just go up to somebody and ask them for weed, but try and get to know them. Potheads are usually social and nice people.

				Depends on the quantity you are looking for, dpending on that factor (and other factors such as age) different methods of finding people can be applied.<br /><br />I would normally say with weed, dont worry about it, the dealers will find you.

				Talk to someone, get cool with them, ask them if they know anyone thats got bud.<br /><br />This applies to any drug in real life. You never know who has the hookups.

				Follow your nose.<br />I don&#039;t even know how many smokers I&#039;ve met just by hanging out at parties or outside my apartment building and just smelling that sweet skunky smell. I usually just have to comment on it and someone will speak up about having some bud to smoke/sell. These days I&#039;m actually more surprised when I meet someone and find out they don&#039;t smoke.
