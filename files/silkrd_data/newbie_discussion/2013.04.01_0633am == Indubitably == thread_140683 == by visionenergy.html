				If anyone has or is planning on ordering from Indubitably here is my experience since I can only post in newbie.&nbsp; &nbsp; I ordered. after a week messaged him asking about package.&nbsp; he said it shippped two days after I ordered.&nbsp; after another week I asked for him to cancel the order and give me a refund.&nbsp; waited until 17 days was almost up.&nbsp; Asked for a full refund in the resolution center. he countered with 50%.&nbsp; Did not accept it.&nbsp; so went to res.&nbsp; was only granted 50%.&nbsp; After another couple days it miraculously showed up.&nbsp; And I got I think 90% flour and 10% mdma.&nbsp; It was garbage.&nbsp; and a waste of my time.&nbsp; First time I ever had to request a refund.&nbsp; If you see his posts.&nbsp; Avoid.&nbsp; There are a lot better vendors out there.

				I cant comment on his mdma, tho I will state I&#039;ve saw good reviews about it. I however purchased a sample of his H when he first came to the road. It never showed up, resolution gave me 100% refund as he never replied to the resolution. I believe however he has worked his kinks out and we will see if my &quot;Customer Appreciation Lottery&quot; shows up I just won today so well see what happens
