				My dream job of driving trucks in Australia turned into a nightmare when I broke down in the outback hundreds of miles from civilisation.<br /><br />After three days the water ran out and started drinking my own urine. After another three days I could no longer recycle my piss and realised I was out of options and had to accept the inevitable.<br /><br />So I opened some of the Fosters I was delivering.

				A state trooper sees a speeder with only 10min left on his shift while heading back to the station and attempts to pull him over. The car is an older sedan and doesn&#039;t stand a chance to outrun the officer but makes attempts lasting about 2min. The gentleman pulls the vehicle over and the officer runs the license plate and sees that the owner is an elderly man with no violations on his record. He approaches the vehicle and ensures the gentleman driving is the owner, and it is. He tells the driver that he only has 5min left on his shift, and that if he can give him a reason as to why he was speeding that the officer has never heard before he will let him go with just a warning. The old man thinks about it for a few seconds and says &quot;My ex-wife ran off with a state trooper a couple of years ago, and I thought you were trying to bring her back.&quot; The officer hands him back his license and tells him to have a great day.
