				Hi folks. I&#039;m in a pinch; one of my family members is about to be homeless and I can&#039;t help them out personally. My hope is to beg some funds and turn them into cash so that said family-member can have a place to rent(even if it has to be a shitty motel) for a little while while they get back on their feet. I have a small amount of spare money but it isn&#039;t enough to actually help, thus why I&#039;m going to ask... just once.<br /><br />Help out an old-hat of SR?<br /><br />Funds can go here, if you want to help: 12d9Q3YE9n574eMXG9ve9vmBTEcyzLwNdQ<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t expect anything of this, if for nothing else than assuming no one will remember me. I&#039;m sure I might get some generosity if I lied and said that I have cancer or some shit like that, but I&#039;ve got enough medical insurance that it wouldn&#039;t be as much of a problem as the reality of family going homeless is. Anything you give helps.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/fe054c8692<br /><br />In case you are wondering if this is legit, there is proof.<br /><br />Anything helps.<br />

The logic to this name was that I don&#039;t plan to stay around very long, but that I am hoping for a little help since I truly need it. I mean, it isn&#039;t &quot;life or death&quot;, but it is &quot;holy shit, I hope this works because I can&#039;t do anything else to help&quot;.

				The real BlarghRawr had been in touch with me prior to deleting his account ... and the OP got in touch with me after I was suspicious, and was able to prove to me that he is really the same BlarghRawr.&nbsp; So, he definitely confirmed his identity with me.&nbsp; :)

Though, and I really hate to say this, but I don&#039;t remember you beyond... maybe? Maybe putting you on the reliable-reviewer list. And even that is a stretch because there were so many people, and it may just be that I think you were on it when I&#039;m really remembering someone else. I&#039;m sure I was slow to get you added though, if you were part of it. I was slow for everyone.

				Another idea is that someone could repaste the OP in the regular section and provide the link. Let me know if you want to do this.

				I&#039;m abandoning my plea for help in favor or a business proposition. In line with this, I&#039;m moving from this mouthful of a forum-name over to RealBlarghRawr, since some cunt stole BlarghRawr from me.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=75777<br /><br />Profile for the new account, and I love the numbering.
