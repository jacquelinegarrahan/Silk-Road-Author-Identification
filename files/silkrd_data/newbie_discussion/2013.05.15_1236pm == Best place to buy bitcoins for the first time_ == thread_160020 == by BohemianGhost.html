				For the safest possible option I&#039;d recommend using bitcoin-otc, at first it is a little daunting but once you&#039;ve used it once it is the best option imo, check the security forum as there are a few thorough guides on how to use it. Where are you from as there are a few easier and quicker options also, if you&#039;re from UK look into using localbitcoins as thats real simple and quick but less anonymous, hope that helps :)

				Localbitcoins - UK bank transfer or meet in person.<br /><br />With UKBT you should have your BTC in minutes providing the seller is online and decent. I have had no problems with this service. There is a mark-up of about £5 at least.<br /><br />Alternatively you can send £ to an exchange such as Bitstamp. Their bank is based in Slovenia I think so you have to do a SEPA transfer which also incurs costs (conversion/bank charges).<br /><br />My method has been to buy more than I need at localbitcoins and send the surplus to Bitstamp where I wait for BTC value to rise. Once it has risen I sell the BTC to at least cover my costs. The fiat stays in Bitstamp ready to be exchanged when I want to make another purchase.<br /><br />
