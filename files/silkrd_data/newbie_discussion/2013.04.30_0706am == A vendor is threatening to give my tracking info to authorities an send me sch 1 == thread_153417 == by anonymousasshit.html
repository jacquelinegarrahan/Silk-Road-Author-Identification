				OK.&nbsp; Here is the story.&nbsp; I want to know how I should handle it.&nbsp; He knows my name, my address and only know his screen name.&nbsp; Do I go to SR Mods?&nbsp; Note, I had many many good transactions before, then he made a mistake that ruined my whole order and he tells me that is the nature of business and he will do nothing to fix it, but if I make trouble for him, he will get me arrested.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Liston stated that he would and told him that I must only get packages from the US.&nbsp; The listing was for US, too.&nbsp; Here is how he is sneaky.&nbsp; He told me just to order the 50 quanity and send him the remaining balance.&nbsp; I had experience with him so I thought he was good.&nbsp; He sent me just the 50, I assume, it weighed about a third of the bag of 150.&nbsp; He wrapped it in paper, no tape, put it in a paper brown envelope and sent it about 10 days after I ordered.&nbsp; I asked for a refund and he refuses.&nbsp; I took it to SR and he offered a 10% refund and accused me of trying to get freebies....after I had spent between 1 and 2 K with him with no problems.<br />Here is the kicker:<br />He emailed me and told me that if I didn&#039;t just drop the dispute, finalize the order and give him positive feedback, he would send a bunch of shit to my house that was obviously suspicious looking, then call the postal investigators and my local police and provide them with the tracking information.&nbsp; I just wanted my refund and to be done with this guy.&nbsp; He was perfect for so many orders and the first time he messes up and I as him to correct it he pulls this.&nbsp; Wish I knew what to do...

				Gee i just looked in the newbie area and WOW Liston appears in several topics... Another SR vendor gone rogue. Just like that slippery little cunt TheTeflonDon that burnt me for a gram of meth. (I was lucky, he got someone else for 40k USD).<br /><br />Tell him to tongue fuck your stinky shit hole and keep the resolution going.. It appears you will have 100% of your BTC returned to you shortly. The fact that he is keeping secure information about you would be enough for me as a SR staffer to shut the vendors account down. <br /><br />He is bluffing and probably desperate, Get a backbone mate.

				This is why I hate the game. Too many fucking adult children involved. In a perfect world, we&#039;d all be able to get our fix from a reputable dealer at a competitive price, just like when we go to buy a fucking 6 pack of some god damned beer.<br /><br />Let me say this to any of you who actually want this system to work, buyers and sellers alike: stop fucking around, because karma is real, regardless of whether you fucking see it or not.
