				That makes no sence. Sorry. A picture dosent prove anything. Why put so mutch faith in a photo and a handwritten sign? As i see it i have to trust all the vendors, and if what hes sendeing dossent allign with what he sold me, i wont finalize. The worst thing for any vendor is a low score, which you should avoide at all cost.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Im saying this becourse im selling produkts with pictures from my webpage, and it dosent seam to convince tomany people. Do i realy need to take crappy pictures of alle my products with a handwritten sign to get credabillyti?<br />Or am i missing somthing.<br />Sorry for all the spelling. Not my native langage.

				Trust. Ever been on 4chan? Nudes aren&#039;t real unless the sharpie/pooper photos are accompanied with a date stamp. Here, drugs aren&#039;t real if they&#039;re not backed up a name. <br /><br />Certainly, it doesn&#039;t prevent all scams; but, it&#039;s a way of at least weeding out people who suck at PhotoGimping.

Two identical vendors, identical prices, identical scores and feedback. One&#039;s got a photo of what they&#039;re selling with their name and a recent date on it, that matches the description. The other doesn&#039;t. Which one you gonna order from? No, it&#039;s not a guarantee they&#039;re gonna send it to you, but it does go some way to getting past the first hurdle, which is rooting out the scammers that don&#039;t even have the product in the first place.
