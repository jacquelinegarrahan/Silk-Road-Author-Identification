				Hi, I feel bad having asking for this, as I did yesterday (but didn&#039;t get any funds), but I am 0.02 BTC short on a transaction. I&#039;d really appreciate it if someone had some spare coins laying around that they could shoot over to me, especially if they felt they could send a little more than the 0.02 just in case prices fluctuate and I wind up a little more short. I can even guarantee you payback, if you so desire, in about a month when I make my next deposit for my next round of purchases. My SR username is percoperfection and my wallet address is 1GhAAbV7EFx4KQfCDyfdzu3xG5uhncpuA2<br /><br />Any help with this would be very much appreciated, and, as I said, if you want I will pay you back in a month or so when I make my next deposit.

				Appreciate the thought. It is such a little amount that I&#039;m hoping to be able to get it this way, rather than the hassle of having to do another deposit. I guess if I did have to do another deposit I could buy a few other things that I&#039;ve been thinking about, but cannot really afford to do so. I wish I could post in the main spare coins thread, but this stupid 50 post requirement is hindering me. Trying to get to 50, but it is a pain.
