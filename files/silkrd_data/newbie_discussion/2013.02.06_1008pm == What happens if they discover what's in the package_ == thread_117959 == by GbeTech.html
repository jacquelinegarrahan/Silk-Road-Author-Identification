				Hey. <br />I haven&#039;t done a single order yet.<br /><br />Can you tell me what&#039;s the likely thing to happen if they find a package, sent for me, with a few grams of weed in it? Also what&#039;s the worst case scenario?

				They are likely to simply destroy it, and possibly (depending on your country) send you a letter letting you know they have seized/destroyed contraband being sent to your address.<br />The worst case scenario is they decide to do a controlled delivery, and arrest you once you have possession of it. But realistically they don&#039;t have the resources to do that to everyone ordering a gram or two of weed in the mail, so it normally only happens with commercial quantities.

				Alright. <br />I guess the way to get out of a controlled delivery is just to deny you know anything about it. Never sign on it etc.<br /><br />And in case they discovered it, do you get your money back from the vendor?

				You should have nothing to worry about if you are using a vendor with a good record for shipping.&nbsp; A few grams would be a waste of any police organizations resources to pursue.&nbsp; Just read the news, the U.S.A. Postal Service can&#039;t even afford to be open their doors on the weekend.&nbsp; In all honesty, they can&#039;t afford to stay open M-F either but are simply chopping off small costs until Congress finally cuts them off like a lazy, do-nothing 30 year old son living on his mothers couch.&nbsp; If they happen to find a small amount being shipped to you, they still have to prove your intent, otherwise we could just ship contraband to people&#039;s houses we hated in the hopes they go directly to jail.&nbsp; They will not try to and prove that intent when you are buying grams.&nbsp; Of course if you are involved in other criminal activity and are already being watched, then obviously you would want to maybe setup a mailbox with a fake ID for regular transactions instead of using your actual address.&nbsp; Just never sign for anthing as mentioned below, that shows your intent.&nbsp; Have fun and be safe.&nbsp;
