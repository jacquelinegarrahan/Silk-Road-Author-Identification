				He has put me down on his page by name and asking vendors to be aware that i am a liar and scammer just because I paid and FE an order from US to AUS that never turned up and he cant handle it so instead of resolving it or saying &quot;bad luck, it must have got confiscated&quot; he has stooped to his immature tactic of saying I am trying to scam him. <br /><br />How do I know it was even sent?

				You don&#039;t. And you finalized early. :facepalm: I dont give a shit if someone has been a vendor for 5 years and all reviews are raving...I won&#039;t FE. If a vendor refuses to deal with me because of that, then fuck &#039;em, move on. <br /><br />When you say blacklisted by name, your true name? Was there tracking info? Have you contacted support for a dispute or to have tracking provided to them?<br /><br />May just have to suck this up as a loss and a lesson and if youre worried about the stigma of being blacklisted effecting future transactions, just burn that user account and start from scratch.
