				Is anyone else having a problem with this? I got some btc today, and it says they were sent 3 hours ago, but when I check the address on blockchain, it says no transactions have been received yet. No coins in my account either. I funded them from bitcopia directly to my SR wallet, so it doesn&#039;t have to actually go through a blockchain wallet, but it&#039;s still not showing any transactions.

				If it isn&#039;t showing on blockchain, then the problem is with bitcopia.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need to get in touch with them.

				I did, and at the time he said that for some reason all the withdraws he made that day were not showing up on blockchain, and that it&#039;s probably just MtGox being slow. <br /><br />I just checked his addy on there a bit ago though and it looks like a small cluster of withdraws from that morning all popped up within a minute of each other...so hopefully it is just MtGox being slow. What do you think scout?

				I have no idea -- all I know is it is not an SR problem ... it&#039;s just something with Bitcopia or, like the Bitcopia person said, maybe with MtGox.&nbsp; Either way, it&#039;s on that end of the transaction.&nbsp; And if it has only been 3 hours, that&#039;s not unheard of, so no need to worry yet. :)<br /><br />

				It&#039;ll need 6-7 confirmations on blockchain before it shows up in your SR wallet ... so it may still be 1-2 hours or so.
