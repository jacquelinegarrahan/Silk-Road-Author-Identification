				Hi People, i&#039;m new here! Thanks for all the info you post .!<br /><br />Would like to see if this happened to someone here.<br /><br />I made a buy, 0.17 were left in my account after that. 7 days after, my password stopped working. I sent an email to support from another account and they resetted my password. <br /><br />The surprise was that when I entered my account again, I got my .17 withdrawed and my PIN changed too. <br /><br />I know what you&#039;re thinking, and that why I&#039;m so disorientated. I always checked the URL. I didn&#039;t entered on a phishing website. The PIN was only used the day i made the buy!!! And is only in a paper in my house. Only used a computer of my own.<br /><br />What do you think that could happen? Are we secure leaving our BTC?<br /><br />Thank you and enjoy weekend!

				Did you ever use the same information anywhere else, or register the same account over at Atlantis?&nbsp; Or ever find yourself on a login page that asked for your PIN?

				Check out using a password generator so that you never use the same password twice.&nbsp; I&#039;m using KeePass and find it very easy to use.&nbsp;

				Keepass lets you create a file that will contain all your passwords. This file will be protected by a &quot;master&quot; password, actually the only one you&#039;ll have to remember.<br />Therefore you can now have different passwords on every site you visit, without having to remember them all. If one account gets hacked, the others are still safe.
