If it has not reached your account within 24 hours, please contact SR Support (using the &#039;Support&#039; link in the bottom right hand corner of any page on the main site) and they will push it through manually for you.<br /><br />Enjoy your time here on Silk Road!<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks Libertas, missed your post yesterday but it came through shortly after that!<br /><br />Made my first purchase but as per vendors guidance on ad have been asked to FE as under 3 ratings.&nbsp; I know I&#039;m probably not protected if I do so but they seem to have really good feedback.<br /><br />Is that common practice for a noob?&nbsp; In fairness it does state it on ad also.<br /><br />ps: if ok how do you actually FE?

Once you leave the protection of the escrow system there will be absolutely nothing we can do to help you should something go wrong.<br /><br />An order can be finalised once it&#039;s been marked &#039;in transit&#039; by the vendor, but again, if you FE you are leaving yourself open to being burned.<br /><br />Libertas
