				Hi guys,<br /><br />Total noob question, want to buy something from a vendor but he hasn&#039;t supplied his PGP key anywhere. He has listed an email address. Whats the protocol? Do I provide my shipping details without PGP or do I email him and ask him for his PGP key? <br /><br />Thanks in advance

				Best bet would probably be to send them a message through SR and ask if they have a PGP key. I think a lot of vendors only use the email for if SR goes down.<br /><br />But if they didn&#039;t post a key they might now have one.

				I only order from guys with PGP Key.<br />Ask the Vendor first, if he says he doesnt have PGP Key just go to another vendor.<br /><br />Safety first :P

				If it&#039;s not on their profile, chances are they don&#039;t have one. If they don&#039;t have one they probably won&#039;t care too much about your security. If they don&#039;t care about your security who knows what sketchy shit they&#039;re doing-recording addresses, bad packaging etc...

				If a vendor does not use PGP then do not order from them. If they don&#039;t bother with encryption they probably won&#039;t bother with safe packaging.

				Did you click on the vendor&#039;s name and look at his vendor page?&nbsp; Because usually the PGP key isn&#039;t on each individual listing, only on the vendor page.<br /><br />But, yeah, like everyone says, if they don&#039;t have a PGP key, that means they don&#039;t give a fuck about your safety, so def don&#039;t order from them<br /><br />

				Thanks for the replies guys, messaged the vendor and he says he&#039;s not set up PGP yet but most of his clients have been using privnote. Seems like a solid vendor with good product and good feedback, is privnote good enough?

				No, Privnote is not safe. Whoever runs it can potentially read all the messages. How do you know it isn&#039;t run by LE and you&#039;re sending your address directly to them?<br /><br />I try not to reward lazy behavior. Not having a PGP key is a showstopper for me. There are enough competing vendors for most products that you can choose one who takes your security seriously by providing a PGP key.<br />
