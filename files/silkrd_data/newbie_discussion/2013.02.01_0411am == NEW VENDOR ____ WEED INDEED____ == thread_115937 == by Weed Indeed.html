				Could you post some pictures? If your prices are competitive I will follow your progress to see if you match up with the best. Will you be sending samples? If so I could leave a great review; I personally consider myself to be a cannabis connoisseur.

				Weed Indeed<br /><br />Wow. Okay this was by far the best weed purchase I&#039;ve ever made. Ever. I cannot believe what Weed Indeed did for me, and it seems like everyone else that ordered.<br /><br />First of all, I ordered an ounce of the Blue Cheese. This ounce was a great price to begin with and he said it was high end. This was the nicest ounce I&#039;ve gotten in a good long time. The smell is so fresh and was obviously indoor plants. The frostyness of this bud was great and all of the nugs were FAT fingers! Not to mention this shit was overpacked!!<br /><br />Ok so just the ounce would earn any dealer a 5/5 for sure. Weed Indeed did not stop there. My ounce came with two different types of extra weed. Who does that? Lemon Kush and the power plant. The lemon kush is the nicest bud and tastes just like lemon when you take a hit. The lemon kush was definitely the best. The shipping was in a very timely fashion and extremely discrete. The weed did not get crushed at all in the process either. Thank you so much Weed Indeed, I highly recommend you to everyone that uses this site.<br /><br />

				Welcome to the road, I was unable to find your vendor account in the main site and I see you do not have a link in your signature so I am assuming you do not have a vendor account yet??<br /><br />If this is the case you are not allowed to do any business until you have a vendor account otherwise your account will be referred to the admins.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />ssbd

				Bought a zip from Weed Indeed, got here fast. Here&#039;s my review:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wow, just wow. This order exceeded my expectations in every single way. This is my 11th ounce weed order on SR and I can easily say the best.<br /><br />Communication - 5/5 - Excellent, replies to all of my messages within 12 hours. Talked throughout the whole transaction.<br /><br />Shipping - 5/5 - Extremely fast! Ordered and shipping on Friday, arrived Monday to the east coast. The storm didn&#039;t delay the package at all.<br /><br />Packaging/Stealth - 5/5 - Triple vacuum sealed with stealth packaging (won&#039;t go into detail). Slightly better packaging and stealth than your average domestic weed order.<br /><br />Product Quality - 5/5 - The bud for this price is absolutely SUPERB. I ordered four quarters of four different strains - Atomic Northern Lights, Lemon Kush, Blue Dream, and Pure Power. All on weight, possibly overweight. Each strain matches the weed, so no BSing here. The Lemon Kush smells and tastes just like lemon, but a natural taste, not like that Juicy Drops flavoring spray. The Blue Dream looks like Blue Dream, looks absolutely DANK. Very bright colors, green and orange hairs look almost red. Atomic Northern Lights and the Pure Power are both pretty dense buds, they smell nice and skunky, and they get you wicked high. Again, for this price, you CAN NOT get a better price on SR. I&#039;ve said that a few times for other vendors, but this is true for Weed Indeed the most.<br /><br />Extras - 5/5 - Not only did Weed Indeed throw in a sample of about 1.5-2g of DANK Blue Cheese, he included a pack of Zen rolling papers. I&#039;ve never heard of these, nor have my friends, but they look pretty damn awesome. I rolled two joints and faced them last night, the Zen papers burned perfectly. A great bonus.<br /><br />Overall - 5/5 - Couldn&#039;t have been better. Will be back for more.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I&#039;m waiting on a zip of his Orange Sunshine, it may be here today if it gets here as fast as last time... and that was during the storm, so I was surprised that it got here in like two days. No clue where Weed Indeed is at right now though. He was supposed to be back from vacation on Tuesday. Maybe he&#039;s processing orders before opening up shop again.

				I&nbsp; don&#039;t think he shipped out until Wednesday so it will probably be at least Friday before we see anything.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting on some blue cheese, but I was tempted by that Orange Sunshine special.&nbsp; He said he was taking the weekend off, so it&#039;s not unexpected.&nbsp; He sold out of product over the weekend as well.&nbsp;

I was getting Cali mail in 2 days, but from certain Cali vendors it would turn up in four-six days. Maybe he missed the cut off time.<br /><br />I&#039;m not worried about it right now. I was earlier, because I thought my new mailman fucked up, but apparently it&#039;s not just me experiencing this delay.<br /><br />Weed Indeed seems legit as fuck based on my last order. He went beyond to make sure I was happy. Free Zen papers and an extra 2g on top of the $190 price for four quarters of top quality bud? Fuck yeah.<br /><br />Let&#039;s just hope he comes back today, it&#039;s been a while.<br /><br />Btw he hasn&#039;t responded to my 2 day old message either, nor has he read it. So you&#039;re not alone on that one, he&#039;s not ignoring us.

				I&#039;m not 100% sure but priority is 2-3 days and if it went to the post office on Tuesday, it would have arrived today at the latest.

				I did not get my package today either.&nbsp; The vendor did reply to my PM on the main site saying it had been shipped.&nbsp; I&#039;m guess he shipped a day or two late due to the situation he had.&nbsp; So I&#039;m thinking we&#039;ll get our stuff Tuesday, as Monday is a &quot;federal employees are lazy and want the day off&quot; holiday.

				My pack landed today- :) Great packing.&nbsp; Got the sampler pack, all the weed looks pretty good. Smoked the blue cheese and the smell, taste and high is fantastic. <br /><br />I would probably order again if i see shipping time is improved. Postage said shipped 2 days after it was put in transit. The would be my only complaint.<br /><br />Thanks weed indeed. I&#039;ll keep an eye on your listings.<br /><br />

				Got my ounce yesterday.&nbsp; The blue cheese is so dank and stinky it smells up the whole house when you open it.&nbsp; It&#039;s some amazing bud.&nbsp; It&#039;s a heavy indica stone from my Arizer ExtremeQ.&nbsp; Got the free Zen rolling papers as well.&nbsp; Looked like a fat ounce, but I did not bother to weigh it.&nbsp; The buds in this ounce are still a bit damp for my taste, but that can be solved by leaving them open in a spare room with a fan on and a air filter running.&nbsp; (Luckily I have some grow stuff to use.)&nbsp; Will definitely be using this vendor again in the future.&nbsp; AAA+ experience.&nbsp; Thanks WeedIndeed!
