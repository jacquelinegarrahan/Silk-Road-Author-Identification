				Because you might cancel the order while it is being filled, and that would be rather unnecessary.<br /><br />You&#039;re too young to do drugs, clearly.

				60 bux for a 40mg opana is not cheap.&nbsp; 100 bux is crazy.&nbsp; come to my way n i sell u some 30mg for 35.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140482.msg960740#msg960740">Quote from: boopers_mc_noopers on March 31, 2013, 05:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I know this is quite the accusation to make, and maybe I am making a huge mistake here, but I searched for Oxymorphone 40mg ER. and he was the only one i saw at the time.<br /><br />Here is his listing:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opana 40mg (Oxymorphone)ER $60.00 FREE SHIPPING!!!<br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/search_results/oxymorphone/0<br /><br />I thought great, 60 bux, and he was the only one with it so i decided to stray fro my rule of 90-100rating buyers only. I then looked again, and a guy I just ordered from who is the master of online pharms has the same pill, but its double the price.<br /><br />Here is the listing of the legit 100 ranked guy:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/bd2570224f<br /><br />DO you guys think I made a mistake, or could this guy just be THAT cheap? Maybe he is just a cop trying to setup a sting and they will try to have me sign or something. Therefore I told him to make SURE it is not signed<br />its only 1 pill,is there a method i can tell him to use that just involves like a really small envelope instead of these huge priority mail bags i get from people with 1g inside and it says electronically signed for. <br /><br />Also here are my purchasing stats<br />&nbsp;Total transactions: 49<br />Total spent: $5573.07<br />Refund rate: 0.33%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 5 months<br /><br />WHY is it that right after a purchase, you can&#039;t cancel until it is marked in transit ?&gt; why is that even necessary. I&#039;d rather pay double the price if i knew it was 100% safe, Should I email SR SUPPORT and explain the situation and I dont want to get fucked over one bad mistake of not ordering from a rep++ dealer but then again he could be legit and i would be getting lots from him if thats true. He has no refund police, so if it is sent and i need a signature, and i refuse, can i get a refund from SR staff giving my stats and all? I messaged delmar813 and told him it&nbsp; MUST be no requirement to sign ,&nbsp; I mean if he was a cop, saw my buyer history, and linked that to the address&nbsp; i gave him for this order etc. What would you guys do? <br /><br />Its really all about him being law enforcement. If he is a scammer and never sends, and I hit resolve, I will surely get all of my cash back considering my stats and I was his first buyer? correct? So take that into account,<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
