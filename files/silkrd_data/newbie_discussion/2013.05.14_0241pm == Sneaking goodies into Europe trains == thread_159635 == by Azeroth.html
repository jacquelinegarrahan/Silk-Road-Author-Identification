				How hard is that? Say we talking about personal use quantities of E, Speed and Lsd, is it doable to sneake some of these into trains?<br />I mean how badly are you searched in those?

				Nothing in Italy or Germany in terms of drug dogs, at least all the times I&#039;ve visited. Could just have been lucky though. Although I never travel with drugs on me.<br /><br />France is a different story. <br /><br />If you can plan ahead, double vacuum seal and an alcohol wash should be enough.

				Thanks man!<br /><br />It also depends on whether or not you&#039;re traveling in a more remote area of the country vs. within/between major cities. Bigger cities, more cops.<br /><br />Also going between countries you should be more wary.

				Back in the late 90&#039;s I used to regularly travel between Antwerp and Amsterdam to post drugs home. Never as much as a sniff. In fact you wouldn&#039;t even notice the border crossing other than the train slowing down for 10 mins. <br /><br />Dunno if things are different now but its always been fairly relaxed in the Benelux area.

				from what I&#039;ve experienced on domestic train travels in EU, having drugs on you is a non-issue as long as you don&#039;t use them on the train. I have occasionally snuck in to the bathroom, opened the window and smoked pot, and everything was fine. My friend however, was not so lucky because the people in the cart behind the bathroom had their windows open so the smell entered their space. Would probably have been fine, had it not been for the fact that they were traveling with kids...<br /><br />So yeah, having them is fine, using them is risky and not recommended. I usually just smoke up before leaving the house for the train station :)

				Regarding the searching part of the question: I have never been searched before entering the train in any country.
