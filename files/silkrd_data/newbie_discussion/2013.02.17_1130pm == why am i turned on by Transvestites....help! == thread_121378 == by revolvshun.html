				yeah,give it a shot if u feel like ;) don&#039;t give too much shit about social conventions, you dont owe accountability to nobody ;)<br />so (most important): &#039;be what you are. your own, very special creation. for that let them come and watch you, give you support or applause. its your world - that, what you want to be proud of, your world and no place where you should have to hide.<br />Life is worth SHIT, until you can say:<br />I am, what i am.&#039;<br />(quoted by a friend;)<br /><br /><br />never forget to protect urself, heard in those tranny circles there might cruise around some nastities at times... :P
