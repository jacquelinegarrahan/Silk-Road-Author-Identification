				So the nicotine brings a lot of tax and makes sure I die before I withdraw a pension.<br />Caffeine keeps me awake and wired.<br /><br />But what&#039;s an alternative that will make me even more awesome and get me a pay rise?

				From a lot of personal experience, working on any type of drug can be detrimental to your productivity, even caffeine or nicotine. I guess it kind of depends on the job though.<br /><br />If I had to choose I would say a LOW dose of opiates, amphetamines, or benzos. Not enough to get fucked up on, but just enough to get a slight buzz on. Like actually use the prescription like it says to on the bottle&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />My advice: just go well rested, and make sure you have sufficient time to completely wake up before you show up.

				It is probably best for an individual to try this on oneself, highs on different can be subjective. As aforementioned, it depends on what kind of tasks your job requires you to be able to do. If motor skills are gravely needed for you to perform a task at work then I would stay off drugs that affect motor skills negatively (e.g. ethanol). <br /><br />If I had to guess I would guess at something like ritalin, adderrall or other stimulants. The addictive nature of these drugs should also be considered, if you happen to come down at work will it affect you too badly for the workplace or not? <br /><br />I hope this helped, bouncing ideas at least!<br /><br />Entity<br />

I used to stack them so i&#039;d take 3 T5s and 3 clens throughout the day, one for breakfast, lunch and then another one at 3pm to help me through the last hours of work and an hour at the gym. I have a manual job so they worked fine, i couldn&#039;t imagine sitting in an office doing them aha.<br />Only side effect was a slight sense of anxiety but i think that&#039;s just me being slightly anxious in general seeing as i have always suffered from it. Coming off of them can cause some people to get pretty angry and short tempered but i never really experienced any of this.<br /><br />Very decent stimulants if you ask me.

				depends what your job is really. if you&#039;re doing something creative or problem solving maybe a psychs or a dissociative, depending on your surroundings. if it&#039;s fast paced, repetitive or physical then a stimulant could help.<br />churchill did coke, hitler did meth. i used to go into work stoned and no one noticed, i just got called out on being a bit slow and forgetful. <br />you can find a killer combo that works for you and hope it doesn&#039;t affect your health or just improve your work environment somehow so you&#039;re happier to be there. using drugs on a reg not for medication or recreation is most likely going to lead to addiction. if it&#039;s a gamble you&#039;re willing to take...

				i take roughly 40mg of adderall every day for work and I&#039;m insanely productive. I&#039;ve been taking it for years, so it doesn&#039;t really impact my sleep or anything like that. The downside is on the weekends, if I don&#039;t take any, I&#039;m like a damn zombie... mind moves so slow and feel so lazy and lethargic.

				I find it annoying when my coworkers show up after smoking weed. They think they are more productive but they really aren&#039;t. If you had to take a drug at work, a -little- bit of speed is probably the best. I would like to say caffeine, but at most of the places I&#039;ve worked if you had a coffee you probably weren&#039;t doing much. I don&#039;t know if the warmth of coffee makes you lazier? I don&#039;t drink it so I wouldn&#039;t know.

				As many has mentioned it all depends on what you do. Also, drugs hit every single person differently if not, the same. For example weed makes me drowsy and just laid back but, for a friend of mine he has this boost of energy and starts to bounce off the walls. So best thing is to take the info everyone expresses, incorporate with what you do and experiment away from work and see what will work for you. <br /><br />For me, I work in a fast pace field, needs crazy amounts of multi-tasking and the ability to always be on the phone talking to people. So I figured one day to go to work on meth just enough to get me going and be focused which in theory should be ideal but I found myself to get &quot;Stuck&quot; and focused yes but on one thing in end I found myself just spending to much time on one thing for to long and messed things up also my memory wasn&#039;t on point.. So, that didn&#039;t work and tried Addy&#039;s and same thing find myself getting focused &quot;stuck&quot; on one task for to long but, memory and focus was great, one good thing about both runs is it only felt like I worked 5hrs on a 13hr shift..lol Till one day at a gas station next to my job started selling ephedrine and it was like a gift from someone at that gas station knowing that I needed the perfect buddy. Since then, I quit drinking coffee and energy drinks..For me I never felt a crash on it like I would from coffee or energy drink. If you do something like data entry or something similar where you have to be focused on one or two things addy&#039;s is the best.. Job is a bit more laid back, I would def go for small dose of benzo&#039;s.. And remember less is better if you&#039;re not familiar to it.<br /><br />

				I say light opiates, like maybe percs or the like. But, I&#039;m one of those people who gain energy on opiates where some people get all groggy from them. I remember the first time I did percs B4 work. I do physical work and it made this 35ish year old ,(at the time) feel like I was 18 again. I had none of the pains we get when we get older and the energy to jut work hard and produce. Of course,m the down side is that was partr of the reason I went from a casual dabbler to an all out, strung out junkie, eventually doing 12-15 OC&#039;s a day, those were the old school kick ass oxy&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since got the addiction 8under control and now just allow myself to play every once in a while.

				Me and my co-workers went down to new orleans this last hurricane season to help replace employees that hadn&#039;t come back after the mandatory evacuation had ended.&nbsp; We took some amphetamine paste from SR with us.&nbsp; Our work is a chain pizza company and we were of one of the only places open within the first weeks after people where allowed back in the city.&nbsp; The amount of bussiness that those restraunts recieved while lacking half of their staff members was probably double or triple what they recieved normaly.&nbsp; After ingesting that amphetamine our boss said to one of my friends after the rush died down that that was some of the best work he had ever done! :)

				a low dose of opiates, just enough to get a little euphoria going. this will be a good motivator to do more work. the downfall is after you do this a few times, you wont want to work without them, then you are working to get the money to buy opiates to work with! this totally defeats the purpose

				Interesting post. I wouldn&#039;t try anything too hardcore, more people know what&#039;s going on than you think! At least in Australia that is <br /><br />One Sunday in the office I hit up so leftover meth before going in, wow so productive it was insane. However on the other hand one Monday I tried the same thing on, not as cool my boss sat down at my desk and eyed me off intensely - onto me but not confident enough to say anything, even though he wouldn&#039;t have done anything about it...<br /><br />Fortunately coffee is usually sufficient to get me through the day!
