				Hello,<br /><br />I am very new, and I understand that business relationships need to be cultivated, but it seems to me that many prices on items here are listed at street market value, even in bulk.&nbsp; Is this common and thus are many vendors on here are just middle men, or are there reliable suppliers dealing in bulk with attractive prices?&nbsp; Specifically in cannabis and prescriptions...&nbsp; Also, many vendors specifically mention that they do not do free samples, but I have not seen anyone who does.&nbsp; Are there vendors out there willing to provide a free sample?&nbsp; Also, and I&#039;m pretty sure the answer to this one is no, is there any product shipped on consignment or on the &quot;front&quot;?&nbsp; A local businessman with whom I am acquainted gets several lb&#039;s of cannabis on consignment through a large supplier.&nbsp; No money ever exchanged until product is sold.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how that would work on here with the anonymity and bitcoin being thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Sorry if my questions are silly.&nbsp; This is all new for me and I&#039;m trying to wrap my head around it.&nbsp; I&#039;m still trying to figure out the best way to acquire bitcoin and use encryption, but I&#039;m not going to give up!&nbsp; Thank you for any info you may provide.

				You will see alot of stree-price bulk cannabis on here.&nbsp; Honestly, if it is selling for street price (here is 34-3600 per lb) then it is of very high quality.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about your area, but the weed I get that is considered good in my area is completely defaced by a lb for 25-2800 on here.&nbsp; You will see alot of vendors selling cheaper lbs and more expensive lbs.&nbsp; The best thing that you can do is do alot of research on what you are buying...&nbsp; You can go look at the weed thread (I think there is one, lol) for more of a quality guage.&nbsp; I mean... east coast &quot;medical&quot; and west coast medical are 2 unrelated things.&nbsp;

				I think it&#039;s great that you&#039;re asking these questions. You don&#039;t know until you know, right? I don&#039;t have answers to all of your questions, but I think I can take a swing at one or two:<br /><br />I think the &quot;front&quot; thing would just not work well here for many reasons. I&#039;ve only ever had stuff fronted from dealers who I had longstanding relationships with, and they knew they could trust me. <br /><br />The prices are what they are because there are many fees attached to using the Road and to buying then selling bitcoins (the &quot;money&quot; that is used here). Many sellers *do* offer bulk discounts seems only to established customers. I think you might be in a position where you have to spend some money on the site before you aren&#039;t treated with suspicion (law enforcement IS on here).<br /><br />I have never seen a free sample from any vendor; it wouldn&#039;t make much sense since the vendor has to pay a bunch of fees to send you a &quot;free&quot; sample. <br /><br />I hope that helps. Good luck to you!

				The only thing vendors py for sending free samples is the shipping since there are no fees are listings for $0. New vendors typically offer a very limited number of samples, I will be starting to vend bud and methylone and will be offer a max of 20 samples.

				Most vendors take the view that if you can&#039;t afford a small amount of the their product you don&#039;t have the cash to buy bulk which I agree with.

				some vendors give free samples but they limit them to just a few and it is in return for a review on their product. they will usually only give them to buyers that have a certain amount of history and purchasing stats. its usually new vendors that do this in order to gain some cred for their product and build some reputation as people are usually wary of new vendors. also sometimes older vendors will give a free sample if they have a new product, again for the same reasons. <br /><br />as for fronting, would you front a lump to somebody who you didn&#039;t know who the fuck they were from the next man. when they don&#039;t pay you, which they won&#039;t coz they don&#039;t have to, what you gonna do about it? ..you couldn&#039;t do anything.

				I guess the biggest thing for me now, after understanding this more, is whether it is worth the time and expense in currency conversion..&nbsp; Where I am located, there is a large organized &quot;criminal&quot; element, which keeps the prices on everything relatively low in comparison to SR..

				good questions, but they wouldn&#039;t work here. those are some of the few pleasures that can only happen from dealing with people in real life. although those &quot;pleasures&quot; are given up here, there is so much more to gain considerikng the free market.
