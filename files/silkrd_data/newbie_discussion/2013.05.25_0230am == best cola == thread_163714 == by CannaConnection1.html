				I haven&#039;t bought from him for 3 or 4 months because his shipping time and response to pm&#039;s was terrible, but with all that said, PablosPuro had the best cocaine I&#039;ve gotten in terms of purity.&nbsp; MarthaStewart also had some really good quality coke about a month ago.&nbsp; I really hope he comes back with more soon.&nbsp; For what is up right now, I&#039;ve had good experiences with King of the Trill, his coke isn&#039;t the best out there, but it is solid when you factor in, price, consistency and potency.

				i have tried bcpltd and Spacewrangler(who apparently went scammer which is both retarded and rediculous). i personally like bc&#039;s powder. its a very clean high with little comedown. only drawback is the high doesnt last as long as others. but with no comedown im ok with that.

				I have a funny feeling that this thread ties into the thread here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161332.0<br /><br />Personally speaking I think this member seems to be looking for the best cocaine available to order and have sent out as &quot;samples&quot; to trusted reviewers here. They are not permitted to advertise samples unless they have a vendor account - which they do not have.<br /><br />I propose that they are then planning to set up a vendor account once these &quot;samples&quot; have been received, make some sales from that account on the back of these excellent reviews by trusted reviewers and acting as a &quot;go-between&quot; - buying other vendor&#039;s products and having them shipped to the buyers. This would most likely be to build up trust and get their stats up so as they can eventually demand FE and potentially make off with thousands of $ in Bitcoin by pulling a FE scam.<br /><br />I am open to correction on that, but by not following protocol they have already shown themselves to be somewhat underhanded. I&#039;m willing to bet 0.5 BTC that I&#039;m correct in the assumptions I have set out above.<br /><br />Libertas

				Their original post specifically says they&#039;re not sending out samples until they have a vendor account bc they don&#039;t want to break the rules:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;We will not be sending these 4 freebies or paid samples out until we place our deposit within the next 2-3 weeks.

Also, pay attention to the stimulants section of SR so you can see our sample listings start to pop up. &quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I don&#039;t see how this is considered underhanded?

				Locking this as CannaConnection1 has decided to try to open up a new thread here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165110.msg1169905#msg1169905<br /><br />Having declined to proffer a response to my previous post in this thread, it is becoming increasingly evident that the suspicions I laid out above are correct. I would strongly advise all members to stay very far away from CannaConnection and CannaConnection1.<br /><br />Libertas
