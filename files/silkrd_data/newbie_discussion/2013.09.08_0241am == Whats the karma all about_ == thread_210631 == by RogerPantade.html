				If someone likes your comment, they can give you + karma.<br /><br />If someone dislikes your comment, they can give you - karma.<br /><br />you need 100 posts to give karma.<br /><br />That&#039;s all it is really.

The tinfoil hat stuff doesn&#039;t fly well here, ironically. A forum about the use of psychoactive drugs, and boogeyman theories are greeted with a healthy dose of skepticism, who knew? <br /><br />Generally though, positive karma proves nothing except that people agree with what you have said. Could mean you&#039;re as full of shit as the people who upvoted you.

				Hahahhaa youre so funny!<br /><br />The war on drugs is the most obvious tinfoilhat subject tho since the conspiracy is out in the open.<br /><br />Governments pay scientists to kill monkeys with cannabis just to be able to show you the &quot;evidence&quot; that cannabis created braintumors.<br /><br />Tinfoilhat subject should work better here then in normal forums since the war on drugs should have woken everyone here up a little, i dont know tho I just know that most people are dumb as hell since the schoolsystem is all about dumbing people down, forcing children to go to school and learn that its okey to force other (bully) and its for their own good they gets forced to repeat texts for 8 hours per day since the slaveparents know the best thing for their kids is to get the slavetraining so the slaveowner can see the grades so they know if they can make money on the kids later in life.<br /><br />Its all about the money.. and slavery. And forcing the kids is nessecary so they dont get to clever and start protesting against modern savery or the force used on kids in schools / slaves in training..<br /><br />Its probably alot of people here who just wanna shut their eye to reality by using drugs and ignoring everything.<br /><br />I say try honesty folks, it works better then drugs and it might change slavery and save humanity if enough people do it. Probably a littleto late tho =(<br /><br />them slaveowners did not do anything posetive with the money they got from the slaves workefforts.. so they destroyed the planet while the slaves were at work ignoring the world and whats happening to our homeplanet =(
