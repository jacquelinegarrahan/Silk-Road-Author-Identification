				No the LSD Museum contains pics of blotters trough time , some might have appeared on SR, about the testings there are some labs that make those tests with a price of course, one of them and a reliable on is ENERGY CONTROL in Spain, there are good labs in the Netherlands, just do some research about it;)

				@modernhippie:<br /><br />So for example, you are saying Jannis sent in two tabs of the Dolphin LSD.&nbsp; I know BlueViking was selling the same stuff and they were both claiming it to be 110-130.&nbsp; So according to your test, you are saying that the TOTAL amount contained in the 2 hits only contained 130ug?&nbsp; So their hits are really only 65ug each?&nbsp; Half what they are advertising?

				no each hit can contain mic in that range, i think that viking,s blotters are exactly the same batch, but one can contain 130 mics and the other may contain less, depends on how evenly they were laid...i have only tested Jannis blotters, so i cant know if viking,s are the real deal,peace<br /><br /><br />you can check more info on blotter dosage in the LSD Museum

				no i,m saying that the testings revelead a spread of 130 ug per blotter /hit if they were laid evenly, those samples from jannis came out positive for LSD 130 ug potency...so they are pretty much as adverstised, cant comment on type of xtal tough...

				Hello, I got your PM. I will be stocking the Dalai Lamas soon and they have been lab testd at 210Ug. The prices will be very competitive. Now I am planning on sending some samples to some trust people on the road for reviews as i know them well. However, May I ask before I start sending samples in here, what makes Your review thread better than the avengers thread ? Please do not take offence, But Im sure you understand where im coming from.<br /><br />Anyone who is interested please shoot me a Pm with any queries you may have, Become a fan and keep an eye out for my listings.

				Interested in lab results for Nelson.&nbsp; I used his product for my first LSD experience, top notch service, but obviously have nothing to compare the experience to.&nbsp; Someone wrote somewhere (can&#039;t remember where) that the tabs may have actually contained only 80-90mg not the 110mg it said in the item description, but this was mere speculation.&nbsp; Will be nice to see an objective result.&nbsp; Great work

				Hi all, I may well possibly be adding to the list very soon. I am just discussing with modernhippy some finer details, such as what is the difference between this thread and the avengers. <br />My tabs are the dalai lamas and have been lab tested at 200- 210ug. <br />Please feel free to check them out.

				Yeah, I would really like to see Machine Maid&#039;s orange sunshine tested.&nbsp; MM is claiming that they are 300ug per hit which is 2-3 times the amount that ANYONE else is carrying at this time on the road.&nbsp; It is just so far out there with the amount of ug per tab that I am having a hard time believing and wanting to pay 2x the price of all the other tabs on the road.<br /><br />MM is the only one on the road selling Orange Sunshines though... so that is one thing.&nbsp; MM may have laid them personally... who knows.

				Hi Modernhippie, thanks for doing this,<br /><br />Here is my question,<br />I have read that most &#039;street&#039; LSD is only about 70% pure, but the good stuff can be 90%+<br />Does the lab test differentiate ie would a tab laid with 150ug of 90% LSD test higher than one laid with 150ug 70% LSD?<br /><br />Also what is the maximum amount of acid that can be laid on a standard blotter?<br />What are the highest strenght tabs that you have tested?<br /><br />Thanks!

				the Lab test will be able to make a diference between the quality of the product , because if it comes with more substances bounded like iso-lsd or other remains from the synth process and final sealing, the test will get them, so less remains more pure, about the amount that can be laid on a blotter depends on the ability of the paper to absorb the liquid but higher dosage is mostly laid in high quality cotton paper and liquid, common commercial blotters usually have 40-100mics no more, but i can assure that are blotters being dosed as much as 600-800mics just have to look in the right places:) but more technical info yo can get on erowid, bluelight,google, but if i can help out just ask, peace

				yeah we need more brothers laying the good stuff and not cutting it off;) , i have had 400 mics blotters and that amount makes you feel really connected to the universe, its too bad that these blotters like the orange sunshines are very rare and only make their appearence once in a while,they are extremly good quality xtal, and i,m not saying this to be nice its a very obective opinion, i have had a lot of blotters in the road from all most every vendors and the orange are still on top, in fact havent seen that quality in a few years now;) everyone should have acess to the real stuff, peace my brothers and we are one;)i,m just waiting on the lab test and the oportunity to try the pimpit santa lucia,s since he claims that its high quality xtal too, lets hope soo
