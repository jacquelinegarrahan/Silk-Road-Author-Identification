				So it&#039;s pretty obvious that most shit being distributed in the U.S. as &quot;molly&quot; is actually some derivative a Bath Salts. (Cheap speed.) I would like to do my part to change that. Who are some good, trustworthy vendors on the SR that are US distributors of MDMA? I know UGsyndicate is pretty much my first choice.. any comments or suggestions on that?<br /><br />Thanks

				If you concentrate your efforts only on US distributors you will miss out on a lot of profits. Most US distributors it would seem are just importing from canada, netherlads, or germany and then distributing it here for as much as a 100% markup even at bulk As long as you are not importing pressed pills, the chance of being caught importing internationally is very little especially if you talk to the vendor and get him to ship lots of smaller packages. That being said I would not buy from the netherlands because it is a red flag for customs. <br /><br />Sorry for not mentioning any specific vendor&#039;s names but it seems that theres a lot of changes going on with MDMA vendors/ the market as a whole recently so just stay attentive to the forums and the answer will find you.

				What he had to say was very helpful.&nbsp; However, the dynamic in the European MDMA market is changing DRAMATICALLY.&nbsp; Normally I&#039;d recommend someone looking to purchase more than a couple grams should look into European vendors but currently the whole situation feels on edge. JoR looks like he&#039;s got some interesting offers though.

				I agree. Something is up. What is sold in the USA as molly is total garbage 99% of the time. <br /><br />I hope things work out in Europe. This sucks.<br />

				I dunno, I agree that most of the Molly on the street is in fact methylone or some amphetamine and/or piperazine.&nbsp; However most US domestic Vendors on the US have high quality products. The prices are just rather expensive.

				i am ordering from MIMM&nbsp; and i will report on it and let you know how it is. i am getting a g of the tan stuff from him, hopefully it is good cuz i have sure got some bunk ass stuff before. i ordered two red question marks that were supposed to be 180mg a peice from happy birthday. so i took a third of one figuring 120mg or so would do me good since i have never even rolled before, i felt NOTHING, nothing at all so i took the rest, nothing, and i took the other pill, barely felt anything, flippin sucked. so yeah i will report back on MIMM and let ya know, he has a pretty good deal for tan crystal right now.
