				Earlier today I was trying to post on a topic but for some reason my letters wouldn&#039;t match the captcha, I tried over-and-over thinking I was just doing it wrong but it never worked. I literally tried over 20x like a dumbass before I concluded something else was the problem. Obviously it&#039;s working now as I&#039;m posting this but I&#039;m just curious if anyone else had this problem or knows what the problem is?

				Yes.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the problem is, but the captcha is giving me a lot of trouble as well.

				I have noticed that sometimes replying to a PM (which needs a captcha) I might get redirected to the main login page again.<br /><br />At the main log in page, no issues there. Just the PM captcha that does it.<br /><br />
