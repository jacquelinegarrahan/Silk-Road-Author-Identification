				Please come in if you are curious or already took it.<br /><br />I know I should write a lot of spam down here before going up there, but hey, I really can&#039;t wait 50posts for getting some wisdome. Also, I have no more drugs left on my drawers, pockets, fridge, or house, so, I&#039;m impatient: <br /><br />Impatient to try this &#039;25&#039; stuff, and impatient to have someone reply me to this silly questions:<br /><br /><br />- Since it &quot;looks like&quot; L.S.D... would you compare the trip to an acid trip? Or not at all? <br /><br />- Does it go &quot;deep&quot; inside you? I mean, can you easily archieve one of those &quot;awesome life-changing dreamy trips&#039;&#039;? Or would you say it&#039;s just a &quot;100% recreational drug&quot;?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m looking for&nbsp; a &#039;solo&#039;, &#039;deep&#039;, &#039;amazing feeling&amp;experience&#039; drug. Not just feel &#039;high&#039;. Something &#039;interesting&#039;.<br /><br />P.S: I NEVER had a psychodelic experience before. Just weed &amp; speed user. So, excuse my silly questions and my shitty english grammar. <br /><br />Thanks!

				I have a fair bit of experience with LSD and I&#039;ve recently tripped twice on 25i. There are some similarities in the experiences: the visuals tend to be comparable in terms of complexity and their fractal quality, though I found most form constants on 25i to be relatively transparent, whereas I&#039;ve had shit completely block out my vision and consume my entire consciousness on LSD. I once had a concert poster come right out of it&#039;s frame on LSD, and then I fell forward (felt like falling down a well) into and through it. I&#039;ve haven&#039;t yet experienced anything that immersive with 25i.<br /><br />LSD feels &quot;harder&quot; as well in terms of the level of intoxication you experience. 25i is more functional, I find I can get things done when I need to without having to fight the drug. I&#039;m pretty functional on LSD, too, but complex actions require an immense amount of discipline and willpower. I can just kind of ignore 25i while I get shit done. <br /><br />25i has a reputation for not being very deep, but I think a lot of it comes down to the user. LSD is pushier, it will force you to face yourself in ways 25i won&#039;t necessarily. Still, I&#039;ve found I alternate between introspective, even dark, moods on 25i and a more laughing, &quot;fuck it&quot; feeling. I&#039;ve had some interesting insights on 25i, usually at the tail-end of the trip, and I think the lightness of the headspace might be good for exploring more painful or anxiety ridden issues for some people than LSD.<br /><br />Oh, and I&#039;d be careful about going solo (especially with high dosage) on 25i until you know how it treats you. A lot of people out there have had nasty side effects (including death), and nobody really knows why yet. I suspect some of these Chinese labs are pushing dirty synthes with toxic by-products, but it also could be that 25i is just dangerous for people with certain genetic make-ups or health conditions. I&#039;ve never had any problems beyond very minor vasoconstriction (tingly feet, numb face), but it would be a good idea to have somebody on hand to call 911 if you stroke out or some shit.

				I am thinking about getting some Tyler Durdan 1000ug ones for a an act in a club in a couple weeks as I don&#039;t want to get on MDMA 2 weeks ion a row.<br /><br />Never tried psychedelics thinking about taking half or even a quarter in the club. Would this be fine to get a bit of a buzz or should I hold of and try it in a different environment. Also can you redoes if you want stronger affects?<br /><br />NewspaperBoy

				Redose is very effective if done w/in an hour or two of initial come-up.&nbsp; From the people I know who redosed later than that it did extend the trip, but definitely ad as much had it been earlier.&nbsp; Tolerance is a HUGE issue w/ all NBOME compounds, and taking it two days in a row is borderline worthless (as well as relatively dangerous IMO).&nbsp; I know kids who only had 500mg one night, and then the next took 1500 and didn&#039;t get to where they were the night before.

				Yeah I am curious too. But I am the opposite of the OP - I just want a pscyhedelic that does the visuals, without any of the introspective head shit.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had some bad turns in life recently and couldnt handle my head being full of thoughts about it for hours and hours. <br /><br />If there was some way to do MDMA with the happy vibes, with the hallucinating of LSD. I&#039;d be well pleased.<br /><br />

				Strangeman has it pretty right. It is &#039;shallower&#039; than LSD while still being a psychedelic, thus still very introspective. I&#039;d like to add that, while my energy level on LSD attenuates to the demands of the environment, 25i hits me like straight up speed for hours. Also, I have had a visually immersive 25i experience that was very different from LSD, in that usually LSD seems to heighten my awareness of features that are already in the environment in a really intense way, but 25i has launched me into totally different visual landscapes. For instance, I was playing guitar just focusing on the music and then I realized I couldn&#039;t see anything around me, because everything around me became a sort of fractal landscape. Or I was looking at a campfire, and it took up my whole field of view to turn into a staircase going deep down to a hellish castle. Thankfully the functionality of the drug keeps you aware that these are surface hallucinations, therefore entertaining instead of totally frightening. <br /><br />

				I have done my fair share of LSD. I have only done 25i once and I will never do it again. The visuals I had from the 25i were amazing. However, I found it to be a very soul-less drug. On LSD, I appreciate the introspection and the way it can elevate your level of consciousness. That is what I love about LSD, and for me, it just isn&#039;t there on the 25i, hence, i&#039;ll be staying clear of it from now on.<br /><br />Sorry for the short reply. If you want a proper psychedelic experience, I would recommend LSD :)

				I did it, it was pretty interesting. I won a few Facebook debates with people I didn&#039;t usually because I was better at thinking about who they are. I could see the frames of cartoons because it seriously changed my perception of time. I realized some cool shit and stopped smoking weed all the time, but that is another question. It didn&#039;t come out of nowhere it just helped me reintegrate knowledge that I had in the past.

				im hoping to be getting a small sample of several NBOMe&#039;s soon but if i dont im going to order some 25i first. from what iv read it seems like NBOMes are more similar to a high dose of mda then lsd. there euphoric, giggly, very visual but without the forced deep introspection or ego lose that good lsd has. i would say NBOMes are more straight up recreational than lsd which is a very powerful psychotherapy tool. ill let you know more when i sample the NBOMe series :D
