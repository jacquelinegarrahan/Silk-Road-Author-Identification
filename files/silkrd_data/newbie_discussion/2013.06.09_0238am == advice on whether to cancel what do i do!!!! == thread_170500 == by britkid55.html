				so i have a few questions...I placed an order on Tuesday and it is still in processing tonight so it has been over 4 days. The buyer is respectable with over 300+ transactions and close to a 96% feedback. Been a vendor for almost a year. This all seems reassuring to me and the feedback is very current. It seems people are receiving packages everyday according to the feedback. Ive searched the forums and there are some mixed reviews about speed but these not so good reviews are from a few months ago; nothing up to date. I was anxious to get my order hoping it would arrive by Friday but that wishful thinking soon diminished. So after reading the above you&#039;d probably think well just wait it out which i most likely will unless a better listing comes up. So I have a couple of questions:<br />Is it good, bad, or neutral that the vendor hasn&#039;t been &quot;seen&quot; the same period of time I have placed my order? meaning I placed the order 4 days ago and the vendor hasn&#039;t been seen in 4 days. So i can deduce that they are not ignoring my order but I&#039;m somewhat worried that something may have happened either LE or an accident who knows... and even though i encrypted my address that sensitive info is just sitting in their messages.<br />Is it strange that since placing the order the vendor now has no active listings (for the product i ordered any everything else)? This changed a day or so ago. <br />How is it possible to remove listings when you haven&#039;t been logged in?<br />Is this a bad thing?<br />If i decide to cancel how long until the money shows back up and if the order was &quot;hedged&quot; do i get the same amount of money back when i placed the order if the value of BTC has gone down?<br />If i cancel does the vendor still have to physically delete my encrypted address from ordering or does it automatically get deleted?<br /><br />i know its a lot of question but this is only my 3rd order. I guess because I had such great experiences from the first 2 orders (marked in transit the following day after ordering and receiving the package 2 days after..) I got a false sense of confidence that every transaction will always be smooth. so what do you all think? wait it out or cancel?&nbsp;

				I think&nbsp; I read someplace that if a vendor doesn&#039;t log in in x amount of days his listings get pulled . I could be wrong bout that one though.<br /><br />I&#039;d say if you can&#039;t contact the vendor and it&#039;s not in transit, you got no choice but to cancel. If it&#039;s something that your really stoked to try maybe give it another day or so but if no response, whatcha gonna do? You will havta cancel and start over with someone else.

				first: you need to relax!!<br /><br />a vendor like you describe has lots going on. it is NOT at all unusual that they take down listing just when yours was supposed to come in. this happens to me quite frequently since many vendors i use are known for their product and people are waiting for it to appear.<br /><br />you can cancel and your money will be returned in about a day. if you are so unsettled then CANCEL the order. i have done this on occassion with a follow up note to the&nbsp; vendor explaining why i did so.<br /><br />if you as a customer are uncomfortable, cancel the order; an experienced vendor will understand this

				I would agree with the &quot;relax awhile&quot; guys , except, this vendor isn&#039;t logging in if I read you right. That, to me, is the fucked up part that would make me lean towards cancel. <br />One thing though,re- read his vendor page first, if you haven&#039;t already, sometimes vendors will put messages their explaining special circumstances .

				yea hasn&#039;t logged in for 4 days now which is what makes me contemplate cancelling. I get people are busy but being inactive for over 4 days as a vendor? That just seems counterproductive who knows how many people are in the same boat...oh well I&#039;m just trying to get a sense of what others have experienced.

				Yeah also check out his posts on here. Maybe he updated his vendor page or something. Mind telling us who the vendor is?

				no update on his vendor page... still not been online so i did in fact cancel my order...seemed a little fishy but Sods law he will come on tomorrow and fill all those orders i think i should just send him a message as to why a cancelled... I went with a diff vendor with a higher rating and more recent feedback. he seems legit! but i just wanted to update, i dont wanna bash a good vendor because i truly believe he is he is just away or something and he didnt do anything wrong because as of right now he doesnt even know i placed an order, the only thing he hasnt done is log on haha
