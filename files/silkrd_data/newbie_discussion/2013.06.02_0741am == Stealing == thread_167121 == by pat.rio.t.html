				Hey, so where can someone learn to pickpocket/be a damn good thief? I mean, like pay to have a professional teach you. I was also wondering the same thing for things like picking locks and breaking and entering. Where can you actually hire someone to teach you? Is there even a market for such a thing? BTW, no crude remarks please. This actually applies to my career, weird as that may sound...

				you can buy lockpicks and books on lockpicking online - I suppose you could also pay a locksmith to give you lessons, although you might have trouble finding a locksmith that is comfortable doing that.&nbsp; as far as pickpocketing goes I don&#039;t think that is really something you can have someone teach you, just start practicing on friend/family/people that won&#039;t beat you up or call the police if they catch you in the act and after you can pickpocket them without them noticing, start practicing on neighbors.<br /><br />that being said, stealing is wrong.&nbsp; breaking and entering is also wrong.&nbsp; if you have convinced yourself either of these are okay, then you have rationalized the truth in order to justify your selfish immoral actions.&nbsp; put the energy you would spend learning these skills into learning an honest trade.

				Interesting first post, But Google can get you halfway to being a successful thief as well as supplying the tools without the SR markup( This whole post can only be accurately applied within the US). Pickpocketing is an art and skill, which only under a hands on apprenticeship could you honestly learn quickly and well. I own lock picks, a lock pick gun for the easy ones, and general knowledge of locks and alarm systems. Common sense and lots of low risk or at home practice can get you pretty darn far on that second half, but only experience will prepare you for true heists or large attempts. Might sound a little dumb but try setting up a mock situation at your household or a friends. Have an item, maybe in a safe or not easily reached area. Create multiple ways to retrieve it. Even better if a second person creates the course so you dont have intimate knowledge of it, just like IRL. Set up trip wires or similar simple alarms and add a real human guard if wanted. This will allow you to develop what you like and what really works or helps. Once you&#039;ve done that, maybe pull a few pranks that require silent entry through locked areas or areas under surveillance. I have done all this and am currently preparing a job on a local convenience store thanks to some inside information as to where the alcohol pallets are currently stored ;) Be careful, Plan, re plan, then plan again, And never ever take a short cut. There is no such thing as too paranoid, and always have an escape plan and alibi. <br /><br />Stay safe, If you have more specific questions i would be glad to give you what i got, Pm or reply post.

				I&#039;m guessing he is the type of guy who goes after people who skip bailbonders. <br /><br />Either way, just search the Clearnet. Tons of shit there.

				Lockpicking can be practised and learned by buying practice locks and picks. Pick pockets are artists and I have a client who is very good at it. He learned and honed his through magic tricks. It&#039;s the only way you can practice pick pocketing in public without getting arrested.
