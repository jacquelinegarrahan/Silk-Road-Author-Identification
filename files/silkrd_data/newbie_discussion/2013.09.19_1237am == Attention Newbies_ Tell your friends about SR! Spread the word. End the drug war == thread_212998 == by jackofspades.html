				Newbies! I am sure many of you have recently arrived here and begun to walk the road.<br /><br />Imagine if the membership of SR were to double. That&#039;s many more buyers, many more sellers, much more quantities and better prices and much better quality all comes with a bigger influx of people on SR. We all win.<br /><br />Also, that&#039;s twice as much money and man hours the feds have to spend fighting this. They can barely keep up now, a big push like this is the turning point we need at this moment to end the war on drugs. The Battle of Saratoga if you will, in the Personal Freedom Revolution!<br />A D-day of civil liberties. <br /><br />This is sure to put LE over the edge. <br /><br />Tell your friends and co-workers and anyone willing to listen, about SR. Even just talk about it in jest or mention it in passing. It is possible that you could be talking to a closet Libertarian or future SR &#039;Hero&#039; member. Who knows, maybe they are members already. <br />Humans are curious by nature and they will do their own research if their interest is sparked. All i am asking of the community is to get out there and be the one that Sparks their interest. <br /><br />The internet is here ladies and gentlemen we must use it to further our agenda. <br /><br />I am here to encourage you to tell your friends about this place. If even half of everyone on SR was to tell 2 friends and even if a small percent decided to join SR then our membership would increase significantly. Even if those whom are told about SR don&#039;t use it themselves, they are likely to tell some friends about this idea, and word of mouth will spread this website all over the country and world. The more people using SR the better. There is power in numbers!<br /><br />Many people who would use SR may not even know about it. The feds will not stand a chance if drugs flood the streets and dug users begin to &#039;wake up&#039; and wake up their fellow citizens to the corruption of the American government. One day even cops and law makers will not be ignore the pleas of the people. <br /><br />Everyone spread the good word of SR as best you can. Talk to your friends, let strangers know, talk about it online and in other forums that may spark the interest of those who are curious enough to venture on the road. Even simply sending the link of an SR Forbes article or the wikipedia page link to someone you think may join or at the very least forward said email or converse about it the next day around the water cooler. This will be the hottest topic and EVERYONE WILL WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SILK ROAD.<br /><br />TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE SR MAINSTREAM. AND I BELIEVE MAKING DRUG BUYING/USING MAINSTREAM IS THE FIRST STEP TO ENDING THE WAR ON DRUGS AND THE WAR ON PERSONAL FREEDOMS.<br /><br />In only a matter of time, Silk Road will be on CNN, FOXNEWS, BBC, MSNBC, in the local paper and on 60 minutes. This will all contribute further to the growth of SR and in turn the end of the drug war. <br /><br />Spread the word, SR is here and the people are waking up. The longer we wait, the more time LE has to prepare and combat us. <br /><br />I implore you here in the SR community to do whatever you can, however small, to build up this community and website in the most productive way possible.
