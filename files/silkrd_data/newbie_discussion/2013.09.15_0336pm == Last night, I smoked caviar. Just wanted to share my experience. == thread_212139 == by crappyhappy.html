				I recently purchased 1 gram of caviar gold from vendor QualityKings (great transaction by the way, highly recommend). For those who don&#039;t know, caviar is weed that&#039;s been soaked in BHO and rolled in kief. I first vaped a small amount on a bed of regular weed And after (what I thought was) a good session, I was quite stoned. It was a really pleasant, euphoric kind of high. I then went to smoke the ABV out of my pipe. On inspection, the weed STILL HAD TONS OF GREEN. After about a half-hour smoke session, The weed hadn&#039;t even been fully vaped!! So my friend and I smoked the rest out of his pipe (if I did it again, I would have just finished it in the vape on a higher temperature) and got FUCKED. It was awesome. And I still have a ton left!! Later in the night, we did some dabs of QualityKing&#039;s OG business oil that he gave me as a free sample. I&#039;m defiantly going to have to but some more of that. It was an awesome night.

				Good to know about the caviar, I&#039;ll put it on my list of things to try now.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried his Blackcard OG wax and it&#039;s very good quality. <br /><br />You can tell he gets his stuff from a dispensary.

				I&#039;ll have to try the wax. It looks like good stuff, but up until now I&#039;ve never bought any concentrates of the Road. Looks like I&#039;ll be changing that soon. My only regret is that I don&#039;t have enough time or money to buy everything I want. Every time I get on the Road, I just want to buy everything.

				Yeah I&#039;d have to admit to losing self control once or twice and ending up with way more than I needed...If only it weren&#039;t so fun.
