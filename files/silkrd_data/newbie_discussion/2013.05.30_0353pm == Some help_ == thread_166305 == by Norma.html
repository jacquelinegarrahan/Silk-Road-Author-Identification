				Hi there,<br /><br />This is the second time I&#039;ve used SR, bought my bitcoin and wanted to transfer over. I thought I might change my SR address, just in case, but the page got stuck, and when I refreshed (a couple of times), the address stayed the same, so I went ahead and did the transfer. Now I went in to my account page, and my deposit address is different.. Will the coins I sent to my &#039;old&#039; address get to me now? If not, how can I fix this???<br /><br />Thanks!

				I believe I read on the site that if you used the old address it will still get to your account.. It just takes a while..I have seen it take 2 - 3 hours to show from mt gox to SR ..

				if on the off chance your coins dont show up ....then at the bottom right corner of your SR page you can contact support.

				Thanks for all the replies!<br /><br />I&#039;m feeling much better about it all now, although blockchain.info says transaction is confirmed, but balance on SR hasn&#039;t changed yet, and was hoping to get a delivery sent out today..<br />&nbsp;Have already posted in support forum, was a bit anxious!&nbsp; :-[ will delete that now..<br /><br />will go have a splif and come back in a while to check..&nbsp; ;)

				Remember...you have to have 6 confirmations on blockchain...then your coins will be tumbled more so before you get them into your SR account...this could take some time. For some people it takes 30 minutes to an hour...for others it takes 6 + hours....patience is indeed a virtue&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Peace &amp; Hugs,<br /><br />ChemCat&nbsp; O0

				Well, patience is not something I have a lot of!&nbsp; ::)<br />Not a bad idea to do it all before bed, and I did start a good few hours ago, but the guy I got my coins from last time has stopped selling, so had to find a new seller.. Also, I&#039;m pretty poor, so like to buy as exact amount of Bitcoin as I can, as I don&#039;t use it for anything else, and I only shop on sr on occasion..<br /><br />Got 4 confirmations now, so at least things are moving!

				Have ฿2.848, need ฿2.85 (as long as rate doesn&#039;t change drastically).. Basically, when I was calculating how much I would need, I forgot about the ฿0.06 delivery charge..<br />I could probably just buy what I&#039;m missing, but it&#039;s such a pain.. do people even sell such small amounts?

				Cheers ChemCat, just sent you your coins back!<br />Thanks for all the info, I might have to get to it another time (next time I use sr), as my back is killing me from sitting in front of the pc all day!<br />What is the real risk of giving sender my address without encryption?
