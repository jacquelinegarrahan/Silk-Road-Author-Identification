				I&#039;ve been reading in some other posts about not selling to buyers who have bad or no buyer stats so I came to shamelessly pimp my lottery listings.<br />I&#039;m a reasonably new vendor and trying to get a rep by building my way up selling smoking accessories and digital goods but if you want an instant boost to your stats I would recommend playing a few rounds of double or nothing, <br />Because of the every increasing sllk road fees (10% + 3 - 5% hedging) the closest I can make the odds to break even is about 42.5% chance of winning along with a refund/free roll.<br /><br />I&#039;m also online here practically all the time trying to learn the business and think of new listings so if you win money will come in no more than 8 hours and chances are within 2 - 3 max. <br />If you have any suggestions for something you would like to see sold I&#039;m all ears as well. <br /><br />Thanks for listening and feel free to spam your way out the back door.<br />Oh and some winners for me would be nice as one guy just bought 40 tickets and won $40 with them just tonight :/ <br /><br />Here is the link to DON: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/fb0e5cb88a <br /><br />

				Basically as a seller I can see how many purchases you have made and what percentage of these you have got a refund for.<br /><br />Many vendors wont sell to people who have not completed 10 or more deals without refund.<br />Basically to the buyer seeing you have made lots of site purchases without issues is a good indicator you are ok and wont claim packages didn&#039;t come and so on.<br /><br />Of course the catch 22 is, how do you improve these stats as a newbie when lots of people wont sell due to your stats...See where I&#039;m going here.<br />Good vendors usually require good stats and scam artists don&#039;t care which is why you hear of so many newbies being ripped off all the time<br />
