				Can you substantiate your claim in some way, e.g., with quotes from messages, etc.?<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered from Duck Commander many times, always received product quickly, with great stealth and good communication.<br />

				Have you talked to the vendor yourself?&nbsp; Maybe he had a reason for doing what he did and will make it up to you somehow.&nbsp; How long has it been since this happened?
