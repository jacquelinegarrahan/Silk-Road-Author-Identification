If all goes well here I&#039;ll ramp up listings but I&#039;m not a big operation nor do I want to be. SR is just a place to sell excess weight to avoid new locals. I think it&#039;s good bud but everyone has their own preferences and best just to try a small sample. No I don&#039;t do free but it&#039;s worth it for what I send for $30.

				Newbie here... I received some of xpsbud recently, got around to trying it last night.<br /><br />Stealth was great, shipping was super fast.&nbsp; Bag came in heavy, definitely a great deal for the $.<br /><br />First thing you notice when you get to the nugs is the scent... very potent and fresh smelling.&nbsp; Honestly, they smell great and if you&#039;re like me and don&#039;t have a chance to smoke for a few days you&#039;ll be daydreaming about the fresh smell.<br /><br />Nugs are cured nicely but are dank nonetheless.&nbsp; They burn very nicely, hold the fire like a charcoal.&nbsp; Smoke is smooth and tastes great.<br /><br />xpsbud says that his plant gives an energetic high, and I&#039;d have to agree.&nbsp; 3 pulls on a small nug and I was good to go, nice head high, not spacey, felt refreshed.&nbsp; Went out back and raked up leaves in the yard, played with the dog, felt great.&nbsp; Within the first hour the head high turned into some nice body rush, still felt great and energized.&nbsp; 3 hours later and I was still pleasantly buzzed.&nbsp; Slept like a baby. <br /><br />All around a great buzz and a great value.&nbsp; Top notch vendor with a great product - happy to have found you and I&#039;ll be back for more!

				Normally on forums I just lurk, but I made an account just to review xpsbud. I recently got scammed and I told him I needed to get some bud for 4/20. He almost immediately responded and told me he would throw in an extra gram and ship it out as soon as possible. Then he emails me telling me he can give me 4 grams for the same price and he can ship it within the hour. I was amazed out how generous and kind he was. He didn&#039;t even ask me to finalize early or for extra Bitcoins. Very nice vendor and I will be doing much business with him in the future. I will update once I get and use the bud.<br /><br />Edit: A few days later than I would have liked to revise and I really have no reason for not updating except for procrastination. I&#039;m very glad everything happened the way it did, because I met xpsbud. His extremely quick response time, usually about 5 minutes to an hour, and his generosity are a very good combination for a vendor. He seems trustworthy, but you never know for all you know I could be him making fake reviews. It&#039;s always good to be skeptical and not just to take people&#039;s words for it. Do your own thinking and always look at the vendor&#039;s stats, but I highly recommend xpsbud. I got scammed out of a significant amount of money and told him that at the time I only had enough for a sample pack. After hours of searching for a sample pack and a vendor that I thought would be able to ship that day, I finally found him. I messaged him and a couple minutes I got a reply. He said he couldn&#039;t ship the package that day, but he would do it first thing in the morning. I thought this would be better than nothing, so I ordered it. We messaged a couple other times and he told me he would add extra due to my situation. After about an hour I didn&#039;t really think of the order too much, but I logged on to see a new message. He told me he could send me 4 grams, mind you I only ordered 2, of some weed he was going to send to a family member and he could ship it that day. Of course I agreed and I was very excited. A little skeptical I must admit, but you never know unless you try. I asked him the next day to keep me updated with the order and he did a good job of it. By Saturday morning the package was out for delivery and I was so happy. I couldn&#039;t be more pleased with a vendor on silk road. He was quick, affordable, trustworthy, super secure, and generous. He saved my ass as earlier in the week I promised my friend I would get weed for 4/20. The quality of the weed was great, my friends loved it and I was so pleased I ordered a lot more. He didn&#039;t ask to me to FE or anything of the sort. I understand how vendors make money and I think it&#039;s ridiculous how a lot of people don&#039;t finalize and just let it auto-finalize. Wonderful experience. I&#039;m kinda glad I got scammed because otherwise I wouldn&#039;t have put so much effort into finding the best deal and I would be stuck waiting 5+ hours for replies from vendors. Will be doing plenty of business with him.

I have found some great vendors on here but I am an all day everyday smoker and have been for decades. Yup they could do some medical studies on me alright!!! Anyway good weed at a good price is all I need. I am starting to look at the cooking side of things, thanks to Delta11, so perhaps you will be helpful in that endeavor as well. Keep up the regular Joe attitude and I think you will do well.

				I recently made my first SR purchase from xpsbud. I am about to make another purchase at the time of typing this posting. That alone should tip you off I am a happy customer.<br /><br />Everything, and I mean everything went off without a hitch. This package was so professionally packed, I wasn&#039;t even expecting it to be my SR package at all. (I had some HDMI cables coming around the same time, so it was a welcome surprise) I cannot overstate the quality of stealth here, I was fooled on the surface myself of what I had actually received.<br /><br />But I am getting ahead of myself here. From the start, replies were swift from xpsbud. I placed my order in the morning after a third shift at work, and after I woke up that afternoon it was already in the mail. Ordered on a Friday, blazed on a Monday. Willing to work with new customers after I had two ordered declined on me previously? Again, xpsbud is your man.<br /><br />The bud itself was sticky, but didn&#039;t have much an overpowering smell till smoked. It produced a great high with a nice taste. (I ordered the Mystery Diesel btw) I enjoyed my sack and was sad when I had smoked it all and had to go back to my local guy due to SR outage. But now I am going to reorder and enjoy some great bud once again!<br /><br />I give this man 5/5 across the board on anything you could possibly want. I wish all of my future transactions on SR are as good as my first one with xpsbud,

				My first SR purchase and xpsbud made it an excellent transaction start to finish. Quick and pleasant communication. Shipping was top notch on discretion and quickness. <br /><br />Product (Mystery Diesel) is nice; smell is earthy and fruit at the same time but not at all over powering. Buds are smaller and dense. A good cure on these too; not the dry crumbly type which I don&#039;t care for. Good body buzz but no couch lock. Smooth pull. He popped in an extra for me to try his other strain and I expect the same quality.
