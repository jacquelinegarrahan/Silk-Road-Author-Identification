				I really hate that addictive nature of checking your order page every ten minutes to see if it says in transit yet, I ordered Sunday so I&#039;m hoping it goes out today as I read in the forums and his feed on his page he&#039;s pretty fast just hoping it gets to me no later than Saturday.

				i wouldn&#039;t take too much notice of it tbh. i ordered from a guy who says on his profile that all orders go out at 2.30pm each day. i ordered at around 5pm so i missed that. within an hour it went to &#039;in transit&#039;, then the next day at around 3pm i got a pm saying its on its way to me, should be with me within a couple of days. so he obviously hadn&#039;t sent it at the time he marked it as in transit.

				The best advice I&#039;ve gotten, which I can&#039;t even follow myself, is to order and forget about it, so you have a nice surprise in a few days - and it makes the time go by faster. But like I said, I can&#039;t do that no matter how much I try to forget about it. Suppose it&#039;s like what they say about LSD: set it and forget it.

				Just woke up and checked and says its still in processing, let&#039;s hope it will be in transit by the end of today. I&#039;m praying as I spent all my money on this for a flip so I&#039;m broke till it comes in.
