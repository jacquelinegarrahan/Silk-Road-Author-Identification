				ok. so bit of a jam. first time on SR. ordered product and addressed it to my own address with fake name. mistake...first to admit it. shipped priority, vendor sent me tracking, its been 8 days and the USPS status reads &quot;Delivery Status Not Updated&quot;.... <br /><br />vendor also told me to call or go ask USPS, that sounds like a horrible idea. <br /><br />second mistake. ordered a very small amount of mushrooms from a very reputable source on SR within the same week that I placed the previous said order. Used another fake name in addition to the one i used in my first order and addressed it to my home address. horrible... what was i thinking? <br /><br />anyways, should i panic? thoughts? advice?

				you should first go to the buyers guide and read the shit out of it!!!!!<br />those are gone now and depending on where you live the address may be <br />flagged. anyways i would make sure that IF you order again you use a different addy <br />till your sure yours is clean. just sayin

				Don&#039;t panic, but don&#039;t call USPS.&nbsp; Cut your losses and try again in a couple of weeks, using congruent name and address.

				second question:<br /><br />should i request a refund from the vendor since package #1 never arrived? <br /><br />also package #2 has yet to arrive, its possible it could still reach my doorstep. What should I do in the case that it does arrive? Open it or chuck it?

				most vendors say on their page that if you use a fake name your on your own.<br />you dont have good stats or the intention of buying a decent amount from that <br />vendor i wouldnt.....<br /><br /><br />as for whether or not to open the package.....idk&nbsp; if it was a big order i would think twice but <br />i&#039;ve never had it happen like that cause then you are opening something that isn&#039;t <br />addressed to you.

				Damn bro, well keep your hopes up, do you live in a populated area? Like a city area or a small town area? I have had stuff sent to an address in a small town area, it was just some random clearnet free samples, but I used a name like, lsdkhfjiadfjn or something and had no problems whatsoever. I am sure It has to do with your area and local post office, as some workers are probably more lenient then others, but RobLob&#039;s right, and I would advise you to check out all the guidlines and tips on the forum and the site, best way to stay safe is to be constantly informing yourself! That is one reason I like these forums so much, I always learn some cool and informative stuff on here.
