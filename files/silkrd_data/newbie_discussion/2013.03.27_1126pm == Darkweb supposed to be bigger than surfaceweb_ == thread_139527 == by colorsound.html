				The deep web is bigger than the surface web.<br /><br />The surface web is defined as anything that is indexed by search engines; anything you can find on google, basically.&nbsp; The deep web is everything that is more secret, such as forums that have a nofollow in their robots.txt file, FTP servers, private Facebook accounts, corporate intranets, military SIPRnet, databases, private email, and darknets<br /><br />Darknets are networks which are anonymous, encrypted, decentralized, or a combination of any of the above.&nbsp; Tor is a darknet, as is i2p, Freenet, RetroShare, and BitTorrent.<br /><br />Seeing as how there isn&#039;t any single darknet to be classified as *the* darknet - I don&#039;t believe any, except perhaps BitTorrent, are bigger than the surface web.

				The Darknet is anonymous decentralized encrypted storage and communications systems. <br /><br />The Deepweb, that is D e e p web, not Darkweb, is all those intranets and databases and so forth that aren&#039;t publicly accessible via a browser. e.g. an SQL database.<br /><br />Deepweb != Darknet.<br /><br />You could say that the Darknet is a (small) subset of the Deepweb I suppose. But most of us don&#039;t think of them in the same way at all. <br /><br />It is journalists who wish to hype SR beyond recognition that continually conflate the two concepts as if they were one and the same, that is why the confusion exists. That and overly excited members of 4chan trading links to websites that don&#039;t really exist. The result is that the Darknet has a whole lot of &quot;secret treehouse&quot; talk because deep down, the majority of people want something cool and subversive to exist because it sounds awesome, like a Bond villain&#039;s lair in a volcano or under the sea. Far be it from me to question the intricacies of the human mind, but darker and more subversive* secrets exist on the regular clearnet :)<br /><br />* SR excepted, lol<br /><br />btw: Bitcoin just broke the billion dollar threshold. If you&#039;re holding B$ for speculative reasons, I suggest you sell. It&#039;s up to you of course.

				sTay OUT of the Darkweb Darknet until you are safe and secure with your Linux development.<br /><br />Without the equivalent of a B.S. in Computer Science, and years of experience, the Dark-anything-digital is a prison sentence.<br /><br />If we lose you to the fedz, then you can&#039;t sell you awesome drugs. Drugs do exist in prison, but so does rape and anxiety.... who wants to be told when they can eat, sleep, shit? And STILL HAVE TO FIGHT nut jobs?
