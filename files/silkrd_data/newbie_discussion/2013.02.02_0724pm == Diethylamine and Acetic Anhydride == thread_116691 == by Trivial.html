				Greetings SR! I have been looking for 100 ml these of two chemicals at lab grade quality for a while now. Short of stealing them I haven&#039;t found a way to procure them.<br />If anyone has access to these and would like to sell them, message me.

				Thanks for the offer but I don&#039;t have the right tools to make lab grade quality acetic anhydride.<br />&nbsp;I was going to make the diethylamine my self but was first seeing if anyone had some 99% pure they wanted to make some money off of.<br />Why work hard if someone has already done it for you and is willing to sell it?

				The only tools needed are a flask, stopper and high temperature tube, much much easier than making diethylamine or most other things for that matter.<br /><br />But good luck, I am worried nobody is gona want to ship those stinky compounds to you.&nbsp; If they have them, that means they have better things to do than make a few bucks mailing some.

Are the precursors for your syntheses hard to obtain?
