				I&#039;ve just been searching SR, google, other areas and search engines on the internet to try to find out the all around best narcotic/opiate/opioid/opioid analgesic, and can&#039;t seem to come up with an at-least fairly certain answer..<br /><br /><br />So to anyone that would be willing to explain a few things, give me their advice, prefference of narcotic (and why), I would greatly appreciate it.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to decide which would be the best opiate/narcotic/opioid/opioid analgesic and these are some of the factors i&#039;m trying to get accurate information on and compare the ups and downs.<br /><br />all answers provided by anyone will be thought out and taken into consideration. please don&#039;t hold back.<br />and I only need the ones that are actually FOR SALE ON SR taken into account. Anything not for sale on SR should not be listed.<br /><br /><br />1. What is the most EUPHORIC&nbsp; opiate/narcotic/opioid/opioid analgesic <br /><br />2. What is the STRONGEST opiate/narcotic/opioid/opioid analgesic per mg<br /><br />3. What is the LONGEST ACTING opiate/narcotic/opioid/opioid analgesic<br /><br />4 What is YOUR overall, absolute, favorite opiate/narcotic/opioid/opioid analgesic, and why?<br /><br /><br />Again, please only discuss/compare opiates/narcotics/opioids/opioid analgesics that are currently available on SR, or if you have anything better, please PM me. <br /><br />Thank you everyone in advance, Sincerely, Sdrawkcab.

				After some debate, I&#039;ve decided to bump this thread. I don&#039;t know about these forums, but usually when one bumps their own threads or just bumps threads period, it&#039;s pretty looked down on. <br /><br />But I feel that this thread did not get the viewing/discussion potential it could have, being that a few minutes after I posted the thread, someone spammed the forums with about 30 threads all saying the same things.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, if I made a mistake and am not allowed to bump threads, especially my own, please inform me on the rules, I am very sorry, and it won&#039;t happen again.<br /><br />Thank you for your understanding, Sincerely, Sdrawkcab.

				I would have to say that with the opiate users I have known, it always just comes down to preference.&nbsp; I&#039;m a heroin girl, but I&#039;ve known a few people who prefers roxys to heroin.<br /><br />acetaminophen makes me ill, and sometimes I have bad morning-after withdrawals from pharmaceutical narcotics, much moreso than I&#039;ve EVER had with heroin.&nbsp; Because I am an IV drug user, heroin makes more sense to me as I hate having to deal with scraping off coatings and smashing pills.&nbsp; I also prefer powdered heroin over tar, as it makes for an easy dissolve.<br /><br />Weirdly enough though, I&#039;ve noticed that percocets give me more euphoria than any other narcotic pill that I&#039;ve ever tried.&nbsp; If I was going to take a pill, it&#039;d be perc.
