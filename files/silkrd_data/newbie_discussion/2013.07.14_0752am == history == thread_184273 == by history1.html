				anyone else getting a bad feeling about transaction history being kept on here?<br /><br />reading the thread on the silk road forum makes for uneasy reading - as does DPR&#039;s explanation<br /><br />i have felt for a while that even though transaction history was being &#039;removed&#039; from being viewed that it was not being completely removed from the system<br /><br />if SR was busted it would make a few people uneasy if LE could gain access to all previous records - on the other hand maybe no one would care if they have washed coins before sending them here<br /><br />maybe i have just been smoking too much weed/crack though..............................

				An alternative, I suppose, would be no keeping of transaction history whatsoever. So every transaction would be like a brand new buyer ordering from a brand new seller, and nobody would have any idea of anyone&#039;s history. But who wants that?

				You shouldn&#039;t rely on a system change if you have these kind of doubts, take the proper precautions each time you send BTC to SR, as well as each time you make an order and there is no problem to begin with.

				It&#039;s understandable, people concerned over the time that&nbsp; history of transactions are kept. I think DPR has our back. Maybe they could keep the transactions but censor the buyer/address. Then they can balance the books and keep people anonymous. He has kept us safe&nbsp; all this time, we can&#039;t lose faith in him now. You can rest assured there&#039;s method in the madness.

				once you&#039;ve received your shit and used it the cops couldn&#039;t do fuck all about it anyway. the only people who would have something to worry about with transaction history is the sellers if they got busted.
