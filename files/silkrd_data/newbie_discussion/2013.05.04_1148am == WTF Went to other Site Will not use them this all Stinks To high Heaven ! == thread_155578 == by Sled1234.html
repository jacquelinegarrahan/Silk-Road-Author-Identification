				To be fair, the other sites could well be run by some anti-drug government agency, but if so it&#039;s a giant waste of time. If you never volunteer any personal information to them, use PGP when messaging vendors and sending your address, and keep your bitcoins in a separate wallet until you&#039;re about to use them, they could search through every inch of your account and still have no idea who you are or where you live. It would be the most elaborate and useless attempt at catching drug dealers and criminals ever.
