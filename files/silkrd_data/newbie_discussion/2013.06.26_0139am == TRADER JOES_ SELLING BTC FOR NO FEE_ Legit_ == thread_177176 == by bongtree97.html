				I changed the title so no one is confused :) I sent him a message on how he would take payment but havent heard back...Im like 70/30 with him, I think he&#039;s legit and like you said royalblue, he might just have bits he wants to get rid of and get some cash without making a big deal about it, but EVERYTHING ive read has said that basically anyone offering something like this with no % fee or it sounds way to good to be true, is a scam. But he looks honest and has great feedback..Im hoping he will respond and put my mind at ease or someone will know if hes a good guy or not.. I cant stand to loose the amount Im needing in coins so Im trying to be extra careful...

				I am a new btc vendor with goals of total domination on sr (evil laugh). I bought in to btc when it was $4 almost a year ago and made a ton of power moves so needless to stay I will never run out or have to wait to buy any. im sitting at about 1000btc and eagerly awaiting Mt.Gox to support LTC soon. after some of my friends mentioned sr I decided to check it out. I love that this community is based on honor/ trust and that most give the benefit of the doubt before running their mouth. In short I decided to create a vendor account knowing that Ill be able to match any price and provide the same standard of service as the trusted vendors do. I based my delivery method off of other trusted BTC vendors since that seems to be the standard around here. If all goes well soon I will have my site running and anyone can anonymously purchase directly from Mt.Gox into their desired wallet. If anyone has questions please message me... thanks

				He looks good to me. Most people wouldnt waste going through 177 transactions to ruin their credit for a little money. Payment options are important though, let us know if he messages you back. The thing that seems sketchy is there&#039;s a 500$ minimum, which I can understand why he would do, but that excludes small time buyers.

I did 2 transactions for the amount I had available. One for $500 and one for $3000. Both customers received their coin with the time it took to hit their wallet. I make 1000&#039;s a week selling my product and would never steal anyone&#039;s money. I do not accept MP, Vanilla, Reloadit, Netspend, etc... It&#039;s very easy for a vendor to cancel the transaction and cash out the Moneypak without the buyer even being able to leave negative feedback. I accept WU under 1k with a test question and ID waived or a Bank Transfer (note to LE, accounts are set up under several names unbeknownst to them and I withdraw the money through ATMs at random locations with a UNIBOMBER disguise at Midnight). Until my usual method gets back to normal I will be offering no Fee BTC transactions weekly. Why? I get my cash quick to buy more product, you get coins without paying a huge fee. You already pay more for drugs on SR then you would locally, why get taxed on getting your coins as well. Lastly, since I do carry an array of products I&#039;d love to get the coin right back from you guys. Liberty, great story about your power moves and all, too bad you didn&#039;t cash out at $255, I wish I did. Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, I told myself to never think or talk about that terrible day again. 1000 bitcoins? Considering Silk Road does over 2 million+ worth of business a month your emense stockpile might last you a few weeks at best. I&#039;d rather pay 5% and go with Bitinstant to Mt. Gox to Blockchain wallet then go with a &quot;bonded Bitcoin seller.&quot; How can one become a bonded seller of a virtual currency, are you licensed in bullshit as well and is your BTC empire FDIC insured also, lol. BTW, I&#039;d also vouch for BlueSkyTraders... I was his very first customer on Silk Road. I sell drugs and want my Bitcoins back to cash ASAP. Watch out for Bitcoin only traders, they have no other way of generating income other than charging you a fee for your own money. Lot&#039;s of good vendors out there that offer NO FEE bitcoin sales from time to time. I&#039;m out but will have 5-6k more in a few days. Between my sales today and the few next week that&#039;s almost 10% of your infinite stockpile. -1 for jacking a thread that was intended to get feedback on my services, not yours. I will beat his Mt. Gox fees and give you 1% extra. Take that hijacker!&nbsp; <br />

				I apologize if you consider this a thread jacking. The OP stated they couldn&#039;t get a hold of you and your Btc listing was not up. I merely saw this as an opportunity to get my foot in the door with a sale. I&#039;m sure you know how skeptical everyone is with a new vendor and without that first person taking the plunge its a huge waiting game.

				Before Trader Joes left on vacation i deposited over $3,000 into a bank america account in exchange for bitcoins with no fees. I had made a similar transaction with trader joes earlier in the week. Trader joes messaged me acknowledging that he was checking his bank information to see if the deposit hit his account and would then send the coins.&nbsp; I never received anything and Trader Joes has not logged in his SR account for 6days nor read any of my messages after telling me that he would send the coins after checking his bank deposit info. Hopefully he will come back soon. I have faith in Trader Joes but i could be out on a lot of money if he doesnt come back

				Ouch mcmillian, I can honestly say I hope he does the right thing and you get your bits or returns your money.. No words can describe that feeling your feeling now, I know it O so well, because Ive been there before. Not quite as much as you have invested, but close to $1000, it was $400 with one person and $375 with another..no one on SR,, this was well before I became aware of SR and was using *gasp* topix.. anyways If I were you I would keep doing what you are doing and let it be known to people your situation. Truly I hope the best of this situation and if/when Trader joes comes around he sure as shit has some explain&#039; to do! I feel for you. <br /><br />Best of luck,<br />Bongtree
