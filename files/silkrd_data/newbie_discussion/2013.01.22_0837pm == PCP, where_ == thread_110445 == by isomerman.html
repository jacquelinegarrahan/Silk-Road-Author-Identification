				Yeah, definitely not a popular one on SR. If you live in the Americas its actually quite abundant, but also depends which area I guess. Never tried sherm, but would love to try doobs dipped in some though haha. Another one I&#039;d like to try is 3-meo-pcp, hear its more enjoyable and you have more control. Anyone had any experience?

				West coast US, alot of it, guy I know who knows someone. Thats the word right now.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mess with it, just a little too unpredictable,&nbsp; too much and it can get ahold of you, in a crazy sort of way.

				Ever since I read the story of Big Lurch eating his girlfriend&#039;s lung, my interest in PCP has waned a bit. Not that I wouldn&#039;t try it, but I&#039;m not dying to get my hands on some. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110445.msg753891#msg753891">Quote from: sinbaby on January 23, 2013, 02:26 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Another one I&#039;d like to try is 3-meo-pcp, hear its more enjoyable and you have more control. Anyone had any experience? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Would you say the sources you&#039;ve heard from a credible. Control sounds nice, though I suppose part of the PCP experience is the loss of control, kinda like being blackout or near blackout drunk. It wouldn&#039;t be the same if you didn&#039;t just say and do whatever the fuck popped into your mind. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=110445.msg760460#msg760460">Quote from: beadvised on January 25, 2013, 03:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Idk why I&#039;ve always been so curious about pcp.

I would recommend Ketamine, or just a bottle of Delsym. Some people look down on Robotripping, but when I used to do it DXM was one of my favorite drugs. Still is; the problem is that, with cough syrup at least, the more you do it, the less you enjoy it until you&#039;re at the point where all you do is vomit and feel awful. I&#039;ve never tried straight powder, but I&#039;m so turned off at this point I don&#039;t think I ever will.

				Dust in higher doses kinda makes you wish you could come down, then the more you wish you could come down and have it wear off, it just kicks your ass even more.&nbsp; Then you just kinda stand there and repeat to yourself &quot;Its only a drug, its only a drug, it&#039;ll wear off&quot;&nbsp; But as your doing that your also like &quot;Oh shit, phew, I can&#039;t take this, its too much, I feel like I&#039;m dying, I hope I don&#039;t die, those people over there, they might wanna kill me, holy shit&quot;&nbsp; as your trippin so high it can&#039;t even be fully described in words.&nbsp; Then you get to running, thats when it gets bad.&nbsp; Cuz then you get friggin hot and have to peel off clothes.&nbsp; Next thing you know your in the middle of the street with hardly anything on, looking around at who&#039;s there.&nbsp; lol
