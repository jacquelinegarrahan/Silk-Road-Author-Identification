				Hi everyone,<br /><br />since I&#039;m restricted to the newbie ghetto, I&#039;ll just post this here instead of this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=141161<br />Would be great if a mod could copy&amp;paste it someday to that thread, or to the trusted cannabis vendor thread.<br /><br />BTW: My buyers feedback still doesn&#039;t show up on the vendors profile page after 20hrs. Is it because it was a hidden/custom order?<br /><br />Here we go:<br /><br />Vendor: MrGardener http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c5ef9ad6b4<br /><br />Communication: fast. Exchanged a handful of msgs, and never waited longer than till next day. Maybe 2hrs on average. Also very friendly! Nice person to deal with.<br />Agreed to do a custom order to match the exact amount of my leftover btc.<br /><br />Packaging/delivery: fast. 2-3 days from .cz to .de. Professional, unsuspicious, padded envelope. Fits in any (normal, european) mailbox. No smell at all (sealed/airtight, not sure if also vacuumed)! Can&#039;t smell, see or feel whats inside. Weed was a bit crushed/flat for delivery of course, but still somewhat fluffy, and a whole intact bud. Not crushed small pieces like commercial bulk weed!<br /><br />Product: &quot;Vanilla Kush A++&quot;. My cheap digital scale says 3,2g. That was roughly what I expected for the 0.41btc that I paid 3 days ago. After opening, the smell was dank! I knew it had to be good! Smelled &quot;fresh&quot;, with lots of intact terpenes. He did a much better job at curing/drying than I usually do. As my nose is not the most sensitive, and I&#039;m not good at identifying smells, I wont comment much on the smell. To me it smelled like a bit of citrus stuff with the typical smell of a fresh harvest. Imho more sativa&#039;ish than expected, but i&#039;m no expert.<br />Was dried good, but not TOO dry - just perfect! Was sticky/oily. Grinding required some effort, because the grinder got sticky ;-) As I said, It was one intact bud, with some parts cut off (to match the desired weight I guess). Plus a smaller piece that either broke off in transit or was added for weight. Taste: don&#039;t know, as usual! For some reason ALL weed that I smoke pure in my little pipe always tasted just like burned plants, no matter how good it smelled before. Maybe I&#039;ve been doing it wrong for years?<br />As I have a little growing experience (not lately, FEDs!), I&#039;m confident that this weed wasn&#039;t laced with jwh-018, brix or other crap. Ash was also greyish as it should (but this also depends on the burning temperature and -length). Also seems to be flushed properly, as far as I can tell.<br />The high/stone was potent but not as indica&#039;ish as I expected. It was a bit mood enhancing/funny at first, and then turned into a mix of a light bodystone and some sort of &quot;headstone&quot;, read: I felt a little &quot;pressure&quot; and &quot;lightness&quot; in my whole head, and of course a bit high. Calmed my mind so I could watch TV without being distracted by a million things. No (strong) couchlock, some muscle relaxation, some general feeling of physical comfort and everything-is-allright, some munchies.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the experience depends on a lot of factors like your natural current neurochemistry, your current mood, if you mix it (e.g. with tobacco or alcohol), if you have a tolerance, when it was harvested (early or late), what growmedium/nutes/lights were used, how it was cured/dried/stored, what pheno it is, if the plant was stressed a lot, the amount you took etc.<br />So no smokereport can tell you what YOU would feel.<br /><br />Just FYI: I smoke almost daily for like 2 years, pure, small pipe, TINY amounts (3-4g = 1 month @ 0-3 small pipeheads daily), probably some light tolerance. I buy on SR to fill local supply gaps and to try many different strains. Also extracts, edibles, and GOOD hash/pollen/skuff etc. is hard to find IRL. &lt;rant&gt;And I hate to BEG some arrogant totally unreliable prick FOR DAYS to finally show up and sell, and sell WHAT WE AGREED ON, not something else, and for the price we agreed on. Dealers are all the same, imho *sigh*&lt;/rant&gt;<br /><br />So, was it the best weed I ever had? Not exactly, but relatively close. Definately the best I had in the last 1-2 years (that includes street, homegrown, SR, indoor, outdoor, auto, photo, indica, sativa)! The best I ever had (unknown strain, very potent hybrid with insane uplifting giggly high and ultra warm and comfy couchlock-munchie-stone), was when I was still an occasional smoker, so tolerance might be a factor. I&#039;d give it a 8/10, which is very good in my book, because I&#039;m a bit picky with my weed. 9/10 would be super good (=best you&#039;ll ever find, realisticly), and 10/10 is reserved for OMFG-can&#039;t-believe-this-is-weed-must-be-from-outer-space kind of unbelievable magic superweed (which most of us will probably never find).<br /><br />Would I order again? Sure! Everything about this purchase was perfectly fine, so why not? I can safely recommend it!<br /><br />PS: Yes, I think SR needs a lot more DETAILED reviews, that also comment on the product. Unlike a lot of ppl here, I don&#039;t think &quot;yeah, it arrived, product ok&quot; is worth anything to other potential buyers, especially newbies. It just indicates that it wasn&#039;t a scam.<br /><br />Yours Truly<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Changed &quot;Mr. Gardener&quot; to &quot;MrGardener&quot; in topic for searchability.

				Hi i have read your review and nearly cryiing lol I ordered from MrGardener to UK on 22April was really looking forward to this delivery, it is now 5th may and i still have recieved nothing. I have more than 10 orders with no problem but clearly this one is not going to arrive. I msg seller before ordering as i have not ordered outside UK before this but he said he had no problems with deliverys and his comms on his page are excellent. I belive the seller has sent the order but because he has not had problems with delivery he just msgs back &quot;just wait your panicking, it will still come&quot; i don,t think it will come he sent to a guy in Ireland and he got delivery 4 days later with 2 of those days having no post, i appreciate delivery times differ but after 13 days i don,t think its coming i have recieved a delivery from another vendor 2 days after ordering since then. I don,t find this seller particularly helpful when i,m messaging him and on his page he says he will resend if order does not arrive but he has mentioned nothing about a resend although he did say he would refund on 6th may if nothing comes but i,ve told him monday is a goliday no post so i,d like a refund today please which he has not done and his reply said why did i go to resolve when we had a deal?? what deal i made no deal i went to resolve cause i recieved a msg from SR telling me to finalize or resolve but he seems to have a problem that i,ve done this? will see what happens next and will update on here.
