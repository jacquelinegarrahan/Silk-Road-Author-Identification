				I am living on a new rental apartment and i have noticed that the utility bill is addressed to the company name from who i am renting the apartment. I&#039;m wondering if i should use the company name to order stuff or my own name. I am not registered to live here or anything. It seems it would be a bit safer to use the company name if the shit hits the fan, what do you guys think?<br />I&#039;m placed in EU if it matters.

				So basically you want to have illegal drugs shipped to you using your landlord&#039;s name? Just stop and think about that for a second. <br /><br />Now go read basically every single vendor page on the site and look for where it says to USE YOUR REAL NAME. <br />

				Yes, basically that was the plan, not sure if it was any good, this is why i asked. I checked the mail and actually i have mail for the previous resident, how about using their name?

				It doesn&#039;t matter what name you put on it, you could have it named Santa Claus, it will still go to the address, so put whatever you want.

				Miss Emma D Amay<br />Mrs Mary Wana<br />Prof Albert Hofmann<br />Ms Katy Mean<br />C/o Kane<br />Mr Mepham Feta-Mean<br /><br />I think these are so ridiculous they are actually more likely to get through. Or, just use your real name..

You cant control what a postman delivers to your house my man, hell no you can&#039;t, the thing with the law is it can be bent at the will by man, You need to Be that MAN. If it ever came on top, then tell them this. <br />You are the victim of a very jealous person, who is clearly trying to ruin your life by sending drugs to you, I mean that Is just fucking tragic, you didn&#039;t contact the police at the time as when you opened your mail you flushed the evil drugs down your toilet, you didn&#039;t report it because you feared you would be called a Dealer, a Fucking Nightmare for the Modern Man .<br />This is not likely to happen if you take some precautions, but if it does, refrain from panic. Remember that to gain a conviction for Jail Time they Have to Prove it, and If your clever they will not be able too, If you are an Eagle you will soar, If you are a Turkey you will be the meal.<br />Peace&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Why i can&#039;t use previous residents name? No one has explained. It wouldn&#039;t be a bogus name, this person really lived here. It would seem i had more credibility if the worst happens do deny everything, when my name actually doesn&#039;t sit on the damn thing.
