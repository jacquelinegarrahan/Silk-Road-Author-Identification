				&quot;Sorry, an error was encountered.&nbsp; We were not able to authenticate your request.&quot;&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I am a new user, just signed up today. I get that error whenever I try to do any of the following:<br /><br />1) put in a backup wallet address in account settings<br />2) send a message to a user<br />3) send a message to support<br />4) Change currency settings in account settings<br /><br />Basically I can do nothing at this point. I just signed up less than an hour ago could that have something to do with it?

				Yea its pretty fucking annoying, half the time when you are trying to post on here in the forums, it says &quot;error last post from your IP was less than 5 seconds ago&quot;, even though you haven&#039;t posted in hours. Silk Road really needs to get their shit together and create a working forum.

You can do the same here just remember you are most likely using th...it also occurs if you run multiple tabs on the forum.
