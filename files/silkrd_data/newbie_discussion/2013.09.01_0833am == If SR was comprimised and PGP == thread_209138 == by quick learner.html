				I&#039;m definately no expert on the topic at matter, so I apologise in advance if this is a very stupid question. I&#039;m just seeking some clarification. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say SR was comprimised and the government gained access to the servers / logs. Will the information be accessable in the format of for example &quot;accountname&quot; , bought &quot;item&quot;, for &quot;5 bitcoins&quot; , and shipped it to &quot;this address&quot; (&lt; which will be visible if it was not PGP encrypted)? And basically with PGP encryption, this address will not be visible to them as its encrypted?<br /><br />Let&#039;s say hypothetically, somebody bought a few small items and did not PGP encrypt his address. However after these few purchases he began to use PGP encryption making purchases on the same account. If SR was to become comprimised, would those viewing the data see that this guy first bought a few items, and sent it to this address, then bought several more items and sent it to an encrypted address. Would it be better for this guy to start a new account and always use PGP for his address?<br /><br />I hope this makes sense, basically in simple terms I just want to know &quot;how they&#039;ll see the information + draw conclusions&quot; if they were to get their hands on it. <br /><br />Thanks in advance

				I can&#039;t imagine that DPR keeps logs any longer than he has to.&nbsp; You didn&#039;t PGP your address when making your order?&nbsp; I&#039;m not a vendor, but I believe that info isn&#039;t saved on SR.&nbsp; The vendor sees your address, and after putting it in transit they can&#039;t see it anymore.&nbsp; If the DEA or whoever got ahold of the SR hardware, they would probably try to recover whatever they could, but as time goes by, their chances of recovering old data starts to go down.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also what someone said earlier, they&#039;ll go after the big people first.
