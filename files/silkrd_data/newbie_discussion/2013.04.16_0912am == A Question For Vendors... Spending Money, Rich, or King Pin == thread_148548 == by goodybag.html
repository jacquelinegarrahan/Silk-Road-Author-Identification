				Greetings,<br />The profit potential of this marketplace seems like it could be great but being new to the world of Bitcoins and PGP make me hesitant. Don&#039;t get me wrong I&#039;m definitely contemplating jumping into the vendor pool but before I do I wanted to ask a few questions of current vendors. <br />I&#039;m not sure if any of these questions have been posed before but I&#039;d appreciate it if you answered nonetheless. Thank you.<br /><br />1.) Are you currently running a profitable business through SR?<br /><br />2.) What&#039;s you average monthly profit or loss?<br /><br />3.) What are some of the pitfalls a new vendor should be aware of?<br /><br />4.) If you could do one thing different, if you were to start again, what would that be?<br /><br />5.) What category do you post the majority of your listings?<br /><br />6.) What&#039;s your current goal in regards to being a SR vendor? (i.e. spending money, quit your day job, King Pin, etc.)<br /><br /><br />Thanking You In Advance,<br /><br /><br />- Goody Bag

If they are vending on SR, they are making money. If they are smartly vending on SR, then they are making a lot of money. <br /><br />2. Average profit for a wise vendor would be around 7-10k monthly I assume, some making a lot less, a lot making a lot more.<br /><br />3. Scammer buyers, competition, competitors buying you out, shortage of product, too much publicity, and most of all ratings.<br /><br />4. I&#039;m sure most vendors who don&#039;t have a perfect rep but should have, wish they would have been more cautious early on because that % stays with you &amp; is a bitch to raise. <br /><br />5. Cannabis, Scripts, Stimulants, Psychadelics...<br /><br />6. I&#039;m not a vendor yet, but my goal is to help the community.

				good response but does all that need to be public especially the amount vendors make on average, sure it&#039;s anonymous on here but obviously the authorities look at this board, you&#039;d think as little information about the extent of the economy should be revealed as possible?

				If you have a look at a vendors feedback/prices who&#039;s selling similar items that you would in your country you&#039;d probably be able to estimate roughly how much they make.
