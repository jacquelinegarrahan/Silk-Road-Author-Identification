				Hello,<br /><br />If I wanted to buy some grass, do I need to put my real name and address in the message to the seller when I purchase? What information does he need to complete the transaction and what are the best methods of designating an address.<br /><br />I live in an apartment type building and not sure if I want my package to be shipped directly to my mailbox out front. Is there a better way to do this?

				Sounds like you need to do some more searching in this forum as all your answers are already here. <br /><br />Buuuuuut...<br /><br />The common consensus is that yes, you do need to include your full real name and full address. You should go to the USPS website and get the absolute correct address and use that (the one that includes your 9 digit zip). This is all the vendor will need to complete the transaction. Besides the bitcoins, of course ;)<br /><br />You will need to encrypt the address as well, unless the vendor specifically says not to. You always should anyways, it only serves to protect you. I would be weary of a vendor that doesn&#039;t require it. If you can&#039;t take the extra couple minutes to learn PGP then you deserve to get busted by the po po. <br /><br />You should more than likely send it directly to your own mail box. You know your situation better than anyone, so if theft or someone getting to your package before you (like parents or punk ass roomates) then you&#039;ll need to make other arrangements: using a different address all together, or consider a PO box (which has it&#039;s own pros and cons, search the forums). <br /><br />Good luck, and I promise you that putting the effort into learning the ins and outs of Silk Road will be rewarding beyond your wildest dreams. <br />
