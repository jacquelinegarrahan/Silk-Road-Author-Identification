				Hey-if the package was seized you will get a letter from customs stating that a package that was addressed to you has been seized.&nbsp; You never took possession of the package, so you did nothing wrong. They cannot prove that you ordered the package.&nbsp; If I were you I would wait to see if you get a letter from customs, and go from there. And no, your door wont get kicked in, the cops in your town wont be stopping buy. You cannot be charged with anything, you did nothing wrong.&nbsp; Hope that puts your mind at ease... Mr420MN420

				If they try a CO, just keep the package by the door and don&#039;t open it for a few days.<br />The cops will get bored and leave.

				depends on where you live but you shouldn&#039;t worry.&nbsp; sellers have a lot more to worry about than buyers, unless you&#039;re buying serious weight in which case the argument could be made that you are a seller.<br /><br />if it were me, I wouldn&#039;t order from that vendor again, or anything across borders.&nbsp; i don&#039;t really know if this is sound advice though, this is just what i would do, i&#039;m not a lawyer.&nbsp; i just don&#039;t like feeling paranoid.&nbsp; <br /><br />also, it&#039;s always wise to have a good lawyer&#039;s number memorized by heart (don&#039;t expect to have access to a wallet, phone, or anything like that if you get arrested, so you need to memorize the #) and if anything does happen, say nothing, (if you&#039;re in the US) tell them you are invoking your right to remain silent and wish to have your attorney present before answering any questions.&nbsp; these are your legal rights, no matter what they say (and cops WILL lie and say just about anything, it&#039;s bullshit.&nbsp; know your rights and exercise them confidently.)&nbsp; these are just all super precautions, but i wouldn&#039;t be afraid.&nbsp; it happens.<br /><br />

				Hopefully nothing bad comes from them seizing it, but just remember so long as you never took possession of the package, they don&#039;t have a very good case against you.

				Never send your information in clear text. use Tails and wipe anything that is stored on your computer that could prove you&#039;ve been on the deep web. Remember plausible deniability. They find tor, deep web url&#039;s, pgp and what not (well maybe not pgp since you didn&#039;t encrypt your address!) on your computer then the easier it will be to stick you.&nbsp; Clear that shit up and clean house and use Tails bro. Deny everything.<br />Remember cops will ask you a million questions to use against you.

How long has this package been in customs?
