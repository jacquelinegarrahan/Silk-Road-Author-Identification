				Have any of you been through the drama of receiving bad product to the point of not being able to let it go? <br />Im dealing with a vendor that specializes in shatter/earwax type products but has listings for C. I dont think he&#039;s a bad vendor, he just sold me some bunk that he originally wanted me to FE for. Within the ten days it took to get here, I read reviews about his slow shipping and finally found one about his C. It was pretty much the same thing I experienced, no euphoria, no drip, no numbness and just jittery as hell. Tastes like Tylenol and I think it has speed or caffeine in it. I told him about this and he stated that no one else has complained about it. Keep in mind not many has buyers have bought his C. Im not saying hes a scammer but he is definitely bullshitting me around. I have had C from most domestic vendors on here and even the weakest C I had was much better that this. I dont want to leave them a bad reveiw but I dont want to be jerked off either.<br /><br />What should I do?

				Well I cant go to resolution just yet, I just want my shit to be proper. Good or bad review, this has wasted alot of time and after this, I&#039;ll start sticking myself in the arm with needles like you.
