				I can&#039;t give details as to the exact nature of my situation as much, as I wish I could, for concerns over the possibility to implicate me in the event an investigation was to take place but that would be very rare as my situation has no connection to SR or relates to it it any way. After discovering the road I have a greater appreciation for maintaining my anonymity not just here but also in real life as much as possible.<br /><br />I have a situation where I ideally I would make a face-book account for the sole purpose of sending a message to someone. Now, I wouldn&#039;t be so bold or stupid to come out and make a bold threat like &quot;I AM GONNA FUCKING BEAT YOU WITH MY ONE OF A KIND AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALL BAT&quot;, nor would anything I said be able to identify me to LE.<br /><br />My objective<br />1) Create a facebook account under an alias<br />2) Send a message using this account to a person that I am having a problem with. I would let them know that if they continue to lie and spread rumors that they will be met with severe ramifications. I would not be identifying myself this message nor would I be using my real name, but said person would know who sent the message.<br />3) Ensure that if this person were to try and bring in LE to file a report regarding what was sent to him, while the &quot;victim&quot; will tell LE he knows who sent the msg that LE will have no way to prove that.<br /><br />I want to know the proper steps I need to take to ensure I remain anonymous through out it all, that even in the event the &quot;victim&quot; does suffer in some way and he can be certain as to the identity of the perpetrator that LE would not have any success in trying to link the message he received on FB from the alias to me thus allowing me to act without fear of legal consequences.<br /><br />I can assure you, I am not a violent man and would hope that my message puts an end to this but this man is a megalomaniac, has a certain position of power that he abuses and I feel needs a reality check. I am not the only person that has suffered due to this actions or will be last person unless I stand up and do what I feel needs to be done.<br /><br />Actually, I can&#039;t front, I think the guy is a huge pompous control freak and manipulator, is an insult to the very religion that he pretends to represent and would love to give him a knucklesandwich or 2 without fear that he could use FB as evidence to have me arrested.<br /><br />Your assistance is appreciated and you can take pride in that you are helping stomp out some of the indecency we have in the world.

				does this man have power over you ?<br /><br />also Facebook tracks EVERYTHING ... you&#039;re better off to set up a tor mail or some anon mail address and send him a nasty email with tor on and scripts disabled

				Best protections to stay off social networks but it goes beyond just FB. This includes Gmail, Msn, Yahoo, and etc. If you are sending unencrypted data through a server using an account connected to your real name, you are not anonymous.<br /><br />Oh and never threaten anyone when you are not anonymous.&nbsp; ;D And fuck you!

				Ok, futz it.<br /><br />I was hired as a manager of a restaurant. Our restaurant had 2 other managers aside from myself in addition to our RGM, who is above all of us. Now, the company has a closed door policy. During my short time with the company I noticed several things that I needed to be brought to the RGM&#039;s attention. On several occasions I mentioned these issues and was either brushed off, ignored, or said they would be handled. I later come to find out that the RGM has been telling employees the very things I have said in addition to thinks of malice that I did not say. Naturally as a grown ass man my first reaction was to beat my RGMs ass and option I am still open and heavily considering. However, I would like to pursue legal action if at all possible and would not want to risk losing this ability due to my bloodlust. In fear that I would either beat someones ass I worked with for stepping to me about something I said to my boss or beating my bosses ass, I quit. I have since made contact with the Regional Manager, this restaurant is a franchise chain. I sent 2 emails before receiving a response and it wasn&#039;t until I mentioned possible litigation in my 2nd email that I got a brief reply back acknowledging they read my emails that he would be in touch with me sometime this week. I currently going through the yellowpages in an effort to find an attorney to see if I have a potential case. If not, I will beat the RGM to the point that he will be unfit to work in the position he is in. I have thought about it and I don&#039;t need to make a threat, again, I actually want to hurt this man more due to the fact that he represents himself as a hardcore Christian when he steals, lies, and is actually a homosexual, not that that is a problem just when you hide that. The man is an insult to God and the very religion he supposedly follows, again by far not the only person to be guilty of such an act, but I am not someone that tolerates being treated in the manner I was without doing something. I don&#039;t lay down, I get down.

				I tried taking the high road. I spoke with the district manager for about 20 min but nothing came of it. He just said he would look into my complaints and that I could have my job back if I so choose. I told him thanks but no thanks, I couldn&#039;t work for a manager like that without beating his ass at some point. I contacted some attorneys in town regarding possible legal options but was told that since I quit I forfeited any right to a claim. Oh well, the world has a way of working things out in the grand scheme of things.
