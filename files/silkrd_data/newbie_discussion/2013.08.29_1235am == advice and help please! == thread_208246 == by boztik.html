				Hello everyone! Been checking out this site for awhile and i think I want to try it. My doctor recomend that I try using marijuana to help with my spasms and neurologic pain. I was in a motorcycle accident that left me a t-2 paraplegic and my pain medicine and valium arent helping anymore. Anyway im a bit sketchy about all this and wonder if this would be safe for me to try. Ive never done drugs before but the way my doctor explained it this isnt like doing meth or something but im still a lil reserved about it. anyway this is my first stop and thought i would just ask the community to donate a lil bit of bitcoin so i can see if this is even viable. i would get them myself but i am unable to drive or go anywhere on my own and my only contact is with nursed and aides that stop by my house to help me with daily living. sorry about my poor typing i have limited hand function. god bless you all and any willing to help god bless you as well. im actually not expecting anything so no worries. this message really just kinda breaks the ice between me and thhe silk road. everyone stay safe!&nbsp; my user name is boztik in case anyone understands what im trying to do. thanks again everyone if for nothing else just for taking time to read this.

				Your doctor recommended marijuana as a medicine? Then surely you must live in a region that has dispensaries.

				Frank- I live in illinois and they just passed medical marijuana but will be at least a year before dispensaries are open but he told me to just ask around. it wasnt a formal advice or anything just his opinion<br /><br />cryngie- thanks for the info. can you point me in the right direction for the purchasing online? everything i researched said to go to the bank. and no worries on a donation by what i can tell there is a lot of scamming on here. i didnt actually expect any replies just assumed everyone would think i was bull shittin or something. Actually i wish i was! life would be alot easier for me if that were the case! thanks in advance for the info<br /><br /><br />
