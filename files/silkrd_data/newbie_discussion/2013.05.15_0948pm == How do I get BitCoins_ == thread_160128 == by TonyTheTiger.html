				If you are just getting personal quantities, just open a Dwolla account and buy directly from campbx.com. Pipe your coins through Bitcoin Fog (http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/) if you&#039;re extra paranoid before dropping it off in SR or a portable Electrum wallet inside a TrueCrypt container. Tracking drugs through the mail is much easier than tracking bitcoins back to their source.

				From what I understand SR does its own tumbling, which is why I added the part about being EXTRA paranoid. Even without tumbling, it is very difficult to prove that you provided those bitcoins used in that drug related transaction. Hell, just admit you have an online gambling addiction and all your campbx moneys now belong to every bitcoin casino you could find, sad but true. Or just flap your gums and admit everything, whatever floats your boat. Just keep in mind that your confession is pretty much the only way bitcoins can be positively linked between your mild mannered self and your living on the edge SR personality. You&#039;re probably not even the real Tony the Tiger.

				Libertas, you need to start a tip bucket for yourself (If you don&#039;t have one already), your very nice to the newbies, and you keep answering the same questions over and over again, and politely :D

				Getting bitcoins is so damn easy (provided you have cash to buy them with). I&#039;ve done the whole bank account to Mt Gox nonsense and I&#039;ve found Bitinstant is a lot quicker for cheap. Bistamp and Virwox are just as easy if not easier than Mt Gox. <br /><br />Bitinstant has never done me dirty. Always get my coins fast and cheap.

				Hi guys,<br /><br />as mentioned earlier the buyer&#039;s guide (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide) will point you to a list of reputable exchangers.<br />I would not go for one not listed. I&#039;m going with MtGox even if the account creation and verifications are a bit of a pain in the ass.<br /><br />Looking at Bitcoin charts (http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/) is interesting and could help save you a bit of money. For example MtGox is about 5$ more expensive as i write this (which pisses me of...).<br /><br />Take care guys !
