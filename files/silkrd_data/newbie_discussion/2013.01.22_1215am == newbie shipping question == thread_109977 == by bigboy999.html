				ok so i ordered for my first time just a few days ago.&nbsp; im sure this question is answered elsewhere but not only am i too lazy to look it up i am actively encouraged to spam post to hit a 50 count ;)<br /><br />anyways, whats peoples experiences with successful shipments.&nbsp; my mail is sometimes opened but only given a cursory glance.<br /><br />i ordered some edibles.&nbsp; think they&#039;ll have &quot;MEDICINAL&quot; or something like that written on them?&nbsp; I hope not, right?&nbsp; Curious as to experiences of other buyers.<br /><br />I ordered two things.&nbsp; I asked the first vendor (for some reason I didn&#039;t the edible vendor, dont want to bug them) and they said they put fake labels .. they put a sticker on it which says &quot;vitamin c&quot; or whatever.

				as a matter of fact, if i were to start doing cocaine, that would make you a preferred vendor ;)<br /><br />i just have this fear that inside the nice stealthy outer packing, there&#039;s a big &quot;I&#039;M MADE FROM SOMETHING ILLEGAL&quot; sign on the items inside.&nbsp; i hope im being irrational ;)

				Packages arrived every time... except for the one FE...&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />One package has been tampered with (corner ripped open...) but stealth took that into account... so no spoils.<br /><br />Uh... well, the next step is to visit (CLEARNET) Fat Wallet... via a non-TOR browser... from your home adresss... and order all the free samples... Amazon? Ebay? Yeah... increase your shipping economy, increase package flow.<br /><br />It not only helps the economy, but it masks our behavior. Vendors&#039; packages should blend in...

				Seriously, though. MiB magnets... where MiB include SWAT...<br /><br />You can get raided for over an ounce...<br /><br />If you&#039;re a new buyer, then you need to take time to secure a fake address/fake name. This still includes sending FatWallet shit... (or whereever&nbsp; you get your Amazon/free samples/snail-mail-spam) to your home address... to increase USPS volume and reduce detection.

				yeah its probrably a good idea not to order letter size packaging try something non illegal and box size and see if they get curious. if they do then you have a grimey mailman or nosy neighbor looking for a score and your shit out of luck
