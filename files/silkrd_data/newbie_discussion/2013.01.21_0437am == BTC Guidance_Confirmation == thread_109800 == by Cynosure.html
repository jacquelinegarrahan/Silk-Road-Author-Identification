				Newbie here,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading around a bit (no pun intended) and feel that I&#039;m still a bit (again) lost on the proper anonymous purchasing of bit coins.&nbsp; If someone could review below and guide me in the correct direction that would be great.<br /><br />I would like to go the BitInstant route if possible.&nbsp; My perception of this was that one is to use their website, fill out a form, print it out, and bring it to a physical location (in my case a Wal-Mart or CVS).&nbsp; However, I cannot find any form/registering area on BitInstant to even begin this process.&nbsp; Can someone help me with this?<br /><br />Once I get past this road mark, I fill out the form using my (false) information and print it out.&nbsp; I then take this form to the physical store, give them the form, talk on a phone with a representative and relay this same (false) information and sweet-talk my way out of presenting a valid ID.&nbsp; This is where my second prospective road block comes in: do I need to register for a Mt.Gox account/wallet and have it sent there (and then transferred again to SilkRoad), or can I send it directly to SilkRoad?&nbsp; What would be the added benefits of either if both are possible?<br /><br />I believe getting around these two issues would leave me with fresh bitcoins in my SR account.<br /><br />My last inquiry is as follows:&nbsp; if my purchase on SilkRoad is $269.50, would paying $280 in cash ensure that I get this full $269.50 as bitcoins in my wallet.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to undershoot and have to do this entire process again.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated!&nbsp; I was going to do the face-to-face method and have someone handle all of this crap for me but there were none reviewed in my area. =&#039;(<br /><br />

				Thank-you very much Dalmata, and I do note the 29th. I have a question, maybe you could help. I have downloaded the gpg4win crypt program and printed out the instructions. My question is: after I test it and it works, how do I get my public key listed under my posts like I see others have?, thanks again for your time. :)

				Actually, recheck that thread, they say something later about being open today. ?? I can&#039;t keep up with my own household schedule, certainly not anyone else&#039;s... :p Anyway, I&#039;m glad that helped.<br /><br />Listing your key in your sig --<br />see this post.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.msg744364#msg744364<br />Let me know if that doesn&#039;t work, although I&#039;ll be in and out for a while. <br /><br />
