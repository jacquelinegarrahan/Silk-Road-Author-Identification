				Hey everyone. Registered on SR a week ago and have been soaking it all in... wow.<br />Ok so I&#039;ve been reading a lot of what the vendors have to say, as well as reading comments and reviews, getting a better grasp on best safe practices.<br />Running a linux box, using Tor bundle configured to use bridges, etc. Even bought my first BTC a few days ago.<br />All I have left to do really is get a firm working knowledge on using PGP encryption (i know there are some nice guides here and elsewhere). Any hard lessons you guys and gals have learned that I should know, feel free to enlighten me.<br />Well, that&#039;s all for now.. First post!<br />-GK

				Hi GreenKarma!<br />At first welcome,i m a newbie too and i was really going crazy for the PGP encrypting messages stuff...<br />Sooo here there is a tutorial on youtube (is really easy 12 mins video and intuitif)<br />I only hope it s not against the rules in the forum (i didnt find anything about it).<br /><br />So,in my personal opinion&nbsp; this is the best tutorial for PGP.<br />(on my tor it doesnt open,if it does on yours i suggest you to take more than a look in this topic : http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=200253.0 )<br /><br />And this is the youtube tutorial (at the end you can notice that the guy is explicitely doing this for SR) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-eFIYhIYk<br /><br />I do not own any rights about it.I hope it s not against the rules of the forum and i hope it will be useful for you an many others :)<br /><br />Cheers

				Hello <br /><br />Use of vpn if possible is always preferred! Make sure scripts on your browser are disabled and you are using tor outside your normal everyday browser. Try not to use your ISP&#039;s DNS servers just in case you click on any of the clearnet links provided in this forum. <br /><br />NEVER EVER USE same password for SR or this forum with any other clearnet sites.

				My advice.<br /><br />Use PGP and only use vendors who use PGP, because it shows they are somewhat cautious. Dumb/careless vendors can compromise their buyers security in a number of ways.<br />&nbsp;<br />Always do as much research as possible on any vendor that you plan on using. Forums, Feedback, and then watch over time. DON&#039;T spontaneously order just because something looks good.<br /><br />If it looks too good to be true it probably is a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />Connect to Tor networks using connections that have no attatchment to you.<br /><br />Use a computer that doesn&#039;t contain your personal info...<br /><br />Smaller buys are more likely to escape detection.<br /><br />Domestic is a lot safer.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use TOR to browse clearnet, only SR.<br /><br />Don&#039;t open any downloaded files while using Tor.<br /><br />Don&#039;t start vending unless you want to be paranoid for the rest of your life. :D <br /><br />

Make sure scripts on your browser are disabled and you are using tor outside your normal everyday browser. Try not to use your ISP&#039;s DNS servers just in case you click on any of the clearnet links provided in this forum. <br /><br />NEVER EVER USE same password for SR or this forum with any other clearnet sites. Password re-use is a serious no-no here.. <br />And don&#039;t post your stats, like how much you bought and when you bought it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>More good advice, and luckily I&#039;ve already followed most of it. Not sure how to edit my DNS on linux, but I&#039;ll figure that out on my own. Password thing is a must, I agree. However, I am using my real SR alias here in the forum, just not my account user name.<br />Nor am I using the same pwd here as I am for SR main. Thanks cbdx_en!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=208847.msg1513453#msg1513453">Quote from: EverAfterGlow on September 03, 2013, 08:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My advice.<br /><br />Use PGP and only use vendors who use PGP, because it shows they are somewhat cautious. Dumb/careless vendors can compromise their buyers security in a number of ways.<br />&nbsp;<br />Always do as much research as possible on any vendor that you plan on using. Forums, Feedback, and then watch over time. DON&#039;T spontaneously order just because something looks good.<br /><br />If it looks too good to be true it probably is a scam.<br />&nbsp;<br />Connect to Tor networks using connections that have no attatchment to you.<br /><br />Use a computer that doesn&#039;t contain your personal info...<br /><br />Smaller buys are more likely to escape detection.<br /><br />Domestic is a lot safer.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use TOR to browse clearnet, only SR.<br /><br />Don&#039;t open any downloaded files while using Tor.<br /><br />Don&#039;t start vending unless you want to be paranoid for the rest of your life. :D <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Wonderful advice EverAfterGlow, especially the last one&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />This thread has been very encouraging, for the info and the helpfulness of the community.<br />1. Always use Tor (with a linux box helps keep out the Win-Holes (with a VPN for another layer of security if it feels too hot))<br />2. Learn to use PGP. Absolute must for ordering (you will see me next in the newbie PGP thread!)<br />3. Never FE. Never FE. and then again, just Never FE!!<br />4. Research your prospective vendors before using them, expect professionalism.<br />5. Ordering domestic is much safer even if it&#039;s not necessarily cheaper.<br />6. Keep all aspects of your SR account/pwd different from any other site, and make them complex.<br />7. Treat your vendor with respect and FOD &lt;-- Finalize on Delivery<br /><br />Thanks again, I&#039;ll be moving to the newbie PGP thread and also be start another concerning transaction etiquette.<br />Cheers!

				To change dns on linux all you have to do is to edit /etc/resolv.conf as root<br /><br />place an entry like the above (w/o quotes) and you should be fine.. <br /><br />&quot;nameserver 8.8.8.8&quot;
