				Hallo everybody, ill be the first to review Indianhighs products so here it is. <br /><br />Communication: I did send a message to the vendor when ordering the sample but got no response but it was shipped out as it should. I dident have any questions so I can&#039;t really comment on this part.&nbsp; -/5<br /><br />Shipping: Was set in transit the day after I placed the order. Arrived in about 7-8 days to Scandinavia which is great shipping speed. One problem here though, I wasent ready that the package needed to be signed for and the vendor should have informed about that. I might&#039;ve been stupid and somehow missed it when ordering but still. Also when I picked up the package I noticed it had a customs inspection sticker on it which made me a little worried. Other then that all good. 4/5<br /><br />Packaging: This was honestly the most absurd package I ever received from here. The outside of the package was like some kind of cloth that had been sown to stick together. Label was handwritten and there was a bunch of weird shit on it. Besides the customs inspection sticker. Inner packaging was even more fucked up. Took me and my friend about 25 minutes to find all 3 products but they all made it even with customs inspection but I&#039;m pulling a point of cause it looked really unprofessional. But I will say I can honestly say that im about 99.99% sure it would pretty much be impossible for customs to find the products in this kind of packaging 4/5<br /><br />Product(s): <br /><br />CHARLES ULTRA HASH (5F-AKB48): Wow where should I begin? Ill start with the smell of this thing cause honestly it&#039;s the most distinct smelling hash I&#039;ve ever seen. If you imagine India into a smell this is what you get. And not the higher classy India, no I&#039;m talking child labor and sweat, fucking love it! The stench of this thing made every single thing that was in the package stink of it, pretty incredible. It&#039;s some really soft hash but it&#039;s also really weird, there are some kind of dots or whatever inside the hash, I don&#039;t really know how to describe it but onto the best part, the smoking of it. <br /><br />This is some really strong hash. First thing I did when I got this was load up a bong. Within maybe 10 seconds I was high. Kept smoking more and got stoned out of my mind. Intense rush which really leaves you couch locked. Big downside though it that the high only lasts around an hour maybe. Still GREAT stuff! 5/5!<br /><br />2c-i: Great stuff here as well. This was my first go with 2c-i, I have tried both 2c-b and 2c-e and this was just as pleasant. I did around 20mg orally and the come up was really really gentle. Started noticing effect after around 40 minutes or so. Around an hour and a half after ingestion I was tripping just the amount I would&#039;ve expected from 20mg. Very pleasant psychedelic I most say. Product was a lot different from say 2c-e which is pretty much a powder like flour. This stuff is rock hard. Got two big rocks and a lot a powder. Very generous amount I have to say. I can&#039;t complain anything here cause perfect stuff :) 5/5<br /><br />25I-NBOME Vitamin: To be honest I wasent expecting much from this at all. I&#039;ve had a few goes with the nbome&#039;s and they have all been really disappointing. Even when I did like 3mg. Dropped this bad boy and around 30 minutes later I started feeling really happy. Everything was great! Smoked some bud and around an hour and a half visuals started coming on. This was my first time actually having OEV&#039;s on nbome and they are great! It&#039;s nothing like say lsd but it&#039;s pretty freaking awesome. I tripped for a looooong time maybe around 6-8 hours or so. Can&#039;t recommend these enough for someone looking for nbome&#039;s. Screw the blotters, these vitamins are freaking awesome! 5/5!<br /><br />Thank you VERY much for the free sample Indian Highs. and I&#039;m sorry for reviewing this so late. Kind of forgot, to much drugs can do that to your memory ;) <br /><br /><br />
