				If someone can add this to the main thread...thnx = http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217772.0<br /><br />On, or around, July 30, 2013 or Aug. 1, 2013 tormail was shutdown and I noticed hatter26 bailed from SR immediately (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=194795.msg1404152#msg1404152 - not me, just lurking). I checked nod (not nob) and he had removed all items and changed his profile to say something along the lines that he has had a _lot_ of new cocaine orders and was switching things up. He never came back.<br /><br />So....he&#039;s been arrested for 2 months and the news of it has been held until the &quot;supposed&quot; DPR bust.<br /><br />Note that you may want to be ready to be busted at the end/beginning of the months.

				Wait...not to sound stupid, but what are you saying? Are you saying that NOD has been in jail for two months and LE was using his account after that?....I thought the thread I read said that NOD (not NOB) just got bagged for the return address shit like NOW, not 2 months ago...Someone please explain my fucking head hurts...

He did not sell another thing on SR from that time on. Now, Oct 3, 2013 KOMO news in Washington state reports he was busted.<br /><br />&quot; By Kristen Drew and Associated Press Oct 3, 2013<br /><br />BELLEVUE, Wash. - A Bellevue man who sold drugs using an online black market known as Silk Road now faces federal drug charges, Homeland Security agents say.<br /><br />According to court documents, 40-year-old Steven Sadler hid his identity using the profile &quot;Nod,&quot; and used a fake name to purchase mailboxes at several UPS stores in Washington.&quot;<br /><br />So:<br /><br />End of July/ beginning of August 2013 - Tormail/Freedom Hosting is taken down.<br /><br />One high end H seller bails (hatter26) - as from Libertas looking into it.<br /><br />I check to see what the other high end seller is doing (Nod), and he has dropped all listings and changed his profile (may have been in stealth also).<br /><br />Nod did not use his SR account for the last two months.<br /><br />Then, SR is taken down and Nod has been reported as arrested.<br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe, I am assuming too much, but without any listing and the profile unchanged, I assumed he bailed along with hatter26...<br /><br />Then the news yesterday makes me assume he was out of business August 1, 2013, but not reported until now.<br /><br />Maybe he had a mail thing going on without SR, bailed on SR,&nbsp; and then they really did just bust him yesterday.?

				Maybe the press was ordered not to report anything SR related until it officially went public and he really was arrested back in August and it&#039;s just being reported as current news....or maybe he just said fuck SR because of something he did that was reckless via tormail....or he may have had a heads up (from DPR?) that SR was being infiltrated and got the fuck outta dodge....either way I don&#039;t think it has any implications for the rest of us as to what&#039;s coming next...we just gotta keep our eyes peeled

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217772.msg1592334#msg1592334<br /><br />The complaint is pretty informative and check the dates.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what they say Nod sold in 4 months:<br /><br />2629.5 grams cocaine<br />593 grams heroin<br />105 grams meth<br /><br />I bet there are lots of nod buyers hoping he deleted their addresses. ;)<br />

				Added onto that thread.<br /><br />Given all the comments on this board about shill feedback for vendors, it seems pretty audacious to charge him for all those reviews.<br />
