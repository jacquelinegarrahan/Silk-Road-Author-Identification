				Hey!<br /><br />Does anybody know what happened to the main listing of Ted Danzig&#039;s fake IDs??? I&#039;ve been planning on ordering some for a couple friends and it&#039;s been a long process getting all their money and info together and taking a usable picture. I finally was ready to put the order in today, only to find that the listing has been taken down!! I messaged the vendor (TedDanzigSR) but have not heard back from him yet. Just wondering if anyone else noticed this or knows what is going on?? He&#039;s supposedly the top fake ID seller on the Silk Road, so maybe some of you will have heard of him... This is kinda stressful.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Thanks...

				Libertas,<br /><br />You quoted him, did you actually read it? The first line says &quot;UPDATE (4-23-2013)&quot;. That was two weeks ago... Before I was even interested. Since then I&#039;ve seen his listing and much feedback posted about it, some as recent as a few hours. But as of today, the listing is gone. (It WAS there yesterday)<br /><br />Thanks for trying to help, but my original question stands...

I imagine he took down his listing either because he is very busy or because he didn&#039;t set the order quantity high enough again and they &quot;ran out&quot;, as mentioned in that update. He is probably leaving the listing down until he can catch up on his workload.<br /><br />Still though, the above is all conjecture on my part; your original question does indeed stand.<br /><br />Libertas

				I just bought two a before the listing went down and they arrived yesterday. We took them out, and the bouncer at the club immediately knew it was a fake. I told him it was a real ID, at which point he put it in the scanner, and it came up with an error. I was really looking forward to this ID after listening to all the hype how Ted has the best ID&#039;s on SR, period, but I&#039;m really frustrated that the ID apparently sucks and won&#039;t even scan, yet is sold as scannable. <br />&nbsp;<br />Take your business elsewhere, so you don&#039;t end up disappointed like me.

Did you message Ted about this?? It seems like that bouncer had it in for you guys. Do you look way too young even be thought of as 21? Is it possible that the bouncer just claimed there was an error because he didn&#039;t want to let you guys in? I don&#039;t think proper mag strip encoding would be that hard, considering the other aspects of making a fake. I&#039;m sure that most of Ted&#039;s IDs are scannable like claimed, I&#039;ve heard other stories of people being able to scan them... Maybe you just got one with a mistake? Shit happens. One of the two I ordered came so far, it looked amazing and legit. My friend hasn&#039;t had the chance to use it yet, but I know I&#039;ll hear about it when she does.
