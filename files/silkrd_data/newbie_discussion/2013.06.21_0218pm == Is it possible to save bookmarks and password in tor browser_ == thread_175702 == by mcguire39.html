				It seems like the option to save passwords is disabled in tor browser, can that be enabled? And saving of bookmarks? I know that&#039;s probably not a good idea but if it&#039;s running off an encrypted USB it doesn&#039;t seem like as big of a risk. Just to save time of having to copy/paste the passwords every time tor gets a new identity.

				I think this kind of defeats the purpose of using a TOR browser for anonymity. Someone opens your browser, opens SR or whatever, your login credentials popup automatically and your history is there for whomever to see. Usually scripting, history, etc. is disabled. Bookmarks should work though.

				Ok I will have to check. I have tor on a truecrypt volume so a casual user of my computer isn&#039;t even going to know I have tor or be able to access my bookmarks or anything else on the encrypted volume. I agree saving the password somewhere isn&#039;t great, but I don&#039;t see how else you do it if you want to have a nice secure random password like HKl5@{{@fG_@+K5S&gt;?Aa&quot;A|@!#

				I imagine running off a TrueCrypt volume probably relieves some or most of the concerns I raised.

				Thanks, ok I got it working. It was a little hard to find this info, it wasn&#039;t on the Firefox support site, but was on some cat&#039;s clearnet blog. First you have to enable saving of history. Then the save passwords box will become enabled. It seems to work now. Firefox stores them in a sqllite database in the data dir. So if you have this on an encrypted drive or USB stick it probably a little more secure. Probably still ideal not to save passwords nor history though.
