				Any domestic Methadone vendors with feedback out there? I missed DeluxeDelivery&#039;s post due to my deposit not coming thru in time. <br /><br />Interested in 10&#039;s or 40&#039;s. Prefer to pay $1mg/or less, but will be willing to pay a little extra on the 10&#039;s.<br /><br />If you are in the USA and have some dones, contact me.<br /><br />privnote works best for now.

				Methadone is free if you go through a lot of paperwork for the government, and they make you perform a physical and test you to confirm how much opiates are in you, and what else is in you. You basically get marked for life as a drug abuser in a number of places.&nbsp; It&#039;s really not a desirable option unless you are really running out of options.<br /><br />This is why methadone purchased by end-users who are trying to turn their lives around is something that SR should at the very least not be complicit in allowing a group of vendors to hinder by cornering the market and setting exorbitant prices.&nbsp; I have posted a few times about how the price for 10mg methadone tablets shipped domestically in the USA seems to be moving in lock step, like the price movements were planned almost.<br /><br />I remember at the beginning of this year tablets were as low as $5-8 for 1x10mg tablet commonly, and the prices crept up until they got to $10 for 1x10mg tablet, and then a group of vendors that have the most methadone and always have stock seemed to increase all of their methadone listings overnight to $20 for 1x10mg tablet, regardless of quantity (so they sell 20x10mg methadone for $200 USD!).<br /><br />This should be investigated by SR staff in my opinion because it is depriving SR members of a tool that might be critical in their recovery from opiate addiction.&nbsp; Seeing vendors profiteer by cornering the market for domestic methadone is absolutely disgusting.<br /><br />I know a vendor who sells methadone every month but every time they list methadone for sale it is all bought up by one person within a matter of minutes.&nbsp; This is on a different sales board, which is how I can see who bought what.&nbsp; I can also see that this methadone buyer literally bought out every single domestic supply of methadone on that site as it came along.&nbsp; That is all they seem to do, buy every dose of methadone that comes along that is less than $20 so they can keep their set price of $20 for 1x10mg tablet.&nbsp; This kind of collusion only works with methadone. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other opiates can be substituted for each other relatively well.&nbsp; But there is nothing out there with the long duration and strength methadone possesses that helps opiate addicts to stay on the path to recovery.<br /><br />Whoever is doing this, shame on you!
