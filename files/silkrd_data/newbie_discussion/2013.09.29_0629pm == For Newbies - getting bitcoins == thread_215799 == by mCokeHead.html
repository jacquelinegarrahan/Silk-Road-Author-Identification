				localbitcoins.com is a great resource. i have used them a couple of times. You need to find a vendor that is quick and trustworthy, but once you do getting bc from them can be very quick and easy. The last time I got bc I got $400 worth and it took less than an hour form the time I ordered them to the time I had them in my wallet. <br /><br />They keep things in escrow. So what you do is get the money to the vendor somehow, some accept email money transfer, some you have to put money directly into their accounts and there are other ways. Keep the receipt for however you sent them money and if the vendor tries to rip you off you can go to the site admin adn show them the receipt and they will release the bitcoins to you. It seems like the vendors need to keep a balance of bc on the site for escrow purposes, so it is harder for them to rip you off. Also it is pretty anonymous so it seems safe there. There are also vendors that will gie them to you in person, just be sure you have a way to check that they are in your wallet before handing over the money, through your smartphone or laptop or whatever.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!
