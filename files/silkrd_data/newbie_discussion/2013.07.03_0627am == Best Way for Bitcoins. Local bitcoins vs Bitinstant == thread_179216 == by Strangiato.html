				I&#039;m looking at buying bitcoins and I wasn&#039;t sure which service I should use. I&#039;m trying to be as safe as possible and have seen complaints about bitinstant&#039;s new restrictions. Should I just go locally and end up meeting someone face to face to get them or use bitinstant with either myself or a friends information?

				Bitinstant is as good as dead. You can make an account using your REAL ID, then just tumble the coins before sending them to your SR wallet, which will auto tumble them as well.<br /><br />Buying coin is not illegal. I have done so myself once before.

				When i bought my first bitcoins i was like you, i wanted to be as safe as possible, and so i met a guy from localbitcoins face2face. But then i read an article somewhere here on this forum where someone claimed that LE kept a guy under surveillence only because he sold 500$ of BTCs via localbitcoins. So dont forgett that even on localbitcoins.com, when you meet with someone face2face, you are not 100% safe.<br /><br />When i bought my second coins, i simply used bank transfer with localbitcoins.com, after that i send them to my offline wallet, then you could additionally send them to bitcoinfog (coin tumbler) and after that send them to SR. I dont think that you will get screwed because you bought some coins, the most important things are &quot;deny, deny, deny....&quot; and to have a clean house when you are expecting a package.

				I use localbitcoins because you can remain anonymous without using any tumbler services, saving you the fee&#039;s.<br /><br />The best thing to do is get yourself a tormail account and then access localbitcoins.com through tor. Create a new account using you tormail address and verify it. Then just select one of the sellers that will accept cash deposit and buy your coins from them. They will give you an account to deposit money into (which can be done without any form of ID) then they give you the coins! Nothing can be traced back to you this way and you dont have to meet anyone!

				Yeah Mezzo, I&#039;m just trying to be as cautious as I can. I&#039;m only going to be buying one to two bitcoins at a time for soft things like extremely small amounts of weed or psychedelics so I doubt LE will give a damn to use all the surveillance and warrants to bust me for something like two tabs of LSD but I&nbsp; just don&#039;t want to end up getting that mindset stuck in my head then screwing myself up,

				I used bitinstant for a while but now they have become so screwed up I cannot do business with them any more. My last transaction was through local bitcoins and it went smoothly and with lower fees than bitinstant. The guy I met seemed cool and I will probably deal with him again.

				Hi, interesting thread good to see a variety of responses and experiences shared on the forum. ill just wade in with my 2 cents. Having used a number of different systems/sites/individuals localbitcoins is by far the easiest for face-to-face or online transactions. Just find a user with 100% feedback ( of which there are many). It also has the lowest fees i believe. Hope this shines some more light on the argument.

You then would go to the closest natwest to you armed with their account number, sort code, and the cash and just put it straight into their bank account with no questions asked!

				Very good shout with the cash deposit for bitcoins.&nbsp; would you get the local bitcoiner to put the coins straight to your SR wallet?<br />Also I have a question...<br />I have noticed with the BTC price going down, the SR Prices has gone up.
