				Im going to college in Iowa and am looking at getting a fake for getting alcohol and going to the bars..<br /><br />I can get an illinois for $150 or a connecticut for around $80<br /><br /><br />does it really matter which state the ID is from? and is it worth paying that much more for a closer ID<br />

				It doesn&#039;t matter where it&#039;s from cause they aren&#039;t going to background check you haha. Just try to make sure you get one of the newer ones that looks holographic since clearly you&#039;re still young, even if you just hit 21 or even 22 that would be the type they would issue you.

				Nah it doesnt really matter what state, what does matter is having a real picture of you and actual information that is on that states current ID&#039;s.<br />I think California might have some of the easier ID&#039;s to get but if you can get an ID from an state that is done professionally you&#039;ll be fine.<br />Just make sure you compare the template design to an actually current ID from whatever state you get.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				Never needed a fake and I have never ordered one so don&#039;t take this as an absolute source.<br /><br />Maybe someone with more experience in the field can help me here but I think that the states that have more identifiers on their IDs cost more to emulate so that they come off real. For example special reflective logos or blacklight checks or whatever.<br /><br />States with less would be easier and thus be cheaper.<br /><br />For an out of state person using a fake from a different state, what is the chances that a bouncer or store clerk in THAT state knows all the nuances of the IDs from the state you are faking?<br /><br />I say if they can make it good then go with whatever state suits you, just keep your story right and if they don&#039;t want to take the ID at one of the places then move on.

				Honestly dude just have your story and stick to it. If they ask &quot;What the hell you doing out here then?&quot; Simply just tell them that your out to college. If it&#039;s a place you don&#039;t plan to go to often an easier method would be to say vacation. The most important part is that you remember the address and everything on there. When I borrowed one of my friend&#039;s ID I had to make sure I memorized all the info. Cause if they ask you to say the info and you say it wrong, they have the right to confiscate it. At least that&#039;s how it is in Illinois.

				If you are going to only have one fake id, then always go with California. There are better templates, more people that make them, and more of a demand. Plus there are people from California everywhere, nobody will question it anywhere you go in the world.

				I&#039;m sure you can understand what I mean when I say that everyone definitely looks and sounds like they&#039;re from a specific area. Just make sure you look like you&#039;d be from that area, make sure you remember the info on it, and make sure it&#039;s a real copy. Best of luck to you. You shouldn&#039;t have any problems though. It always seems a lot harder than it is. I&#039;ve gotten into bars before and never even had to show an ID. But it also kinda helped me in the fact that I could grow a full beard when I 14... Haha. I never really get questioned about my age. People are actually shocked when they found out I&#039;m not 21 yet. But even without looking older, as long as you have the ID, it&#039;s not going to be too hard, honestly. And if one bar fails just learn from that mistake and move to the next. I guarantee you&#039;ll at least get it on your second try if not the first.

				Well since you are in college it shouldn&#039;t matter. As long as you look to be from that area. Like dont get a cali id if you are pale with no tan

				Bouncers won&#039;t care where you are from! you are all paranoid. If the ID is legit looking then fuck whoever, you&#039;re a student from out of state. PEOPLE DO THIS ALL THE TIME! get one, live with it, become that person. You are doing nothing wrong, it&#039;s your id not a fake one. You shouldn&#039;t have any problems. Do what your gut tells you to do. If you&#039;re in a city the bouncers see a ton of ID&#039;s a night, they won&#039;t remember seeing that card that night. And once your ID passes at your local bar they will stop asking for it.<br /><br />Now run grasshopper. you have much to learn.

It&#039;s college, a completely fresh start. Become a whole new person! I know I did and it was a lot of fun. It&#039;s a chance to totally reinvent who you are. With that in mind, select an ID of what you want to see yourself become, get that ID and use it as your excuse to make it happen! Hope you have a blast. I can&#039;t wait to pick back up in college in Cali.

				Personally I&#039;m not even a big fan of alcohol. I will always pick drugs over alcohol. I&#039;d rather do drugs and feeling amazing during and after rather than drink and feel like shit during and feel like I&#039;m dying after. Haha. But hey to each their own. Just trying to help some people out with their questions. :)

				Just to finish up here the biggest question I think you will deal with is &quot;How is life in [whatever place you chose here]&quot;.<br /><br />People will be interested because you are from out of state other than that I think you are right and you are just thinking too much about it because of what it is.
