But there&#039;s lots of decent Kush around priced anywhere from $1500-2800 from what I&#039;ve seen. The only Cali bud I smoked was twenty years ago called &quot;California Gold&quot; and it wasn&#039;t any better than the bud from BC.&nbsp;

				BC weed is probably cheap because it&#039;s such a remote area, people can harvest it without cops hassling you.<br />Quebec weed is apparently cheap because rent is cheap and so is electricity.

				It is pretty obvious why weed is cheaper in certain places than others. Look at prices in Cali compared to Texas. This is because in Cali, literally anyone can get a med card and grow legally by state law. In Texas they&#039;ll give you a fkn year for a joint. Higher risk means higher prices....Canada is very lenient on marijuana and it is so cheap in B.C. esp at the moment because there are a SHIT LOAD of &quot;medical clinics&quot; where as long as you have a diagnoses that Marijuana can help with (anyone can fake insomnia, no appetite, depression, etc.) as long as your diagnosed, you pay the doc $500 bucks and they give out MASSIVE licenses...I&#039;m talking like being legally allowed to grow 400-600 plants and the difference between Canada&#039;s medical marijuana program compared to the USA is that ours is federal unlike the states where the feds can always come in and arrest you even if your legally abiding by state law, federal law trumps all and marijuana is still a schedule one drug in the states. <br /><br />Here in Canada, once you get your grow license, NO ONE can do shit about it unless you are actually caught selling your &quot;meds&quot; to someone who is not one of our registered patients which if you deal with the right people or even better, use SR, is nearly impossible. (you are only allowed to grow for 5 patients and yourself, not that those rules matter) so all these guys are literally buying warehouses and pumping out hundreds of pounds a month with NO risk so NO risk means cheap as fuck prices and its because of people/organized crime abusing the fuck out of our medical program that by 2014 no one will be allowed to grow medical marijuana even for personal use. Before weed was only prescribed to cancer patients, the dirty doctors in BC allowed organized crime to jump all over it...As if anyone that is sick can set up a hundred light warehouse grow...<br /><br />In Ontario high quality kush can still easily go for over 3K a pound....Lots of people are making a shitload of money just shipping shit from out West over here or better yet to provinces like the Yukon or Nunavut, weed is worth way more even in Alberta which is strange as it is so close to B.C. but Ontario has the second highest number of grows so thats prob why we have pretty good prices too. so pretty much if you grow in BC right now, its not even worth it unless you have ways of selling it to other provinces.

				Also, famous strains that are just as potent as beautiful as so many of the ones in Cali are easily available in Canada. M-39 is NOT a good strain, why do you think pounds are 2K on SR? IRL you can get a pound cheap as fuck, I once bought a pound of it for $600 to make cookies with..Everyone in Ontario calls it &quot;China weed&quot; as it is grown mostly by Asian gangs but is also very popular in Montreal amongst the hells angles which is where I believe it originated but the hells angels have started to cross it with kush strains as they realize how much more money they can charge if their weed just slightly has the kush smell/look. The only reason people grow it is because it is SO easy to grow and it pumps out SERIOUS weight in a very short flowering time and the nugs actually come out looking very dense and covered in red hairs so it looks really good in a bag, but as soon as you actually inspect a nug you will notice their are NO thrichomes (the crystals on the bud) and when you smoke it, it usually tastes like shit and just produces the most dull &quot;high&quot; (I don&#039;t even want to call it that) ever....It doesn&#039;t get you high, it just makes you a little tired, not even relaxed, just tired. It&#039;s garbage and people in B.C. call it or any commercial strain that is just designed to yield well and look good in a bag &quot;beasters&quot;

				Much more tolerant LE attitude towards weed. Especially in BC, its a similar situation to many areas in NorCal where there are whole neighborhoods growing weed, with the law turning a blind eye. In Vancouver (Hongcouver!) in particular, there used to be whole extended families brought over from asia who were set up by ethnic gangs to grow in multiple houses. Some of the small towns are largely propped up economically by pot. I grew up on the BC border and the beasters were everywhere. Generally the stuff that is (was?) exported is pretty mediocre, airy, not trimmed well, not the worst schwag, just blah. Back in the day, BC bud was considered a step up from mexican brick, but was acceptable and cheap enough for the kids in more rural areas. Haven&#039;t seen any in quite awhile, so maybe the average quality has improved to compete with the improved access to high class weed and medical stuff in many places. That being said, there is plenty of GREAT weed grown in Canada. Canadians love their pot and appreciate quality. The current successful push for state legalization has some of its roots in BC over the last 20 years. Google Marc Emery. I knew some people who were running a legalization campaign in a western state some years ago and Marc sent them a huge check!
