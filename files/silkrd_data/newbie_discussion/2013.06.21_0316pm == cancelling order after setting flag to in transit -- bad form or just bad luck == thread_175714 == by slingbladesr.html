				I just had a vendor (who I paid last night, and who,by the end of last night had their status flag set to &quot;in transit&quot;) cancel my order and refund me, saying they were out of product (they were showing dozens of units when I made the order).&nbsp; It sort of seems to me (as a newbie) that if you&#039;ve set the flag to &quot;in transit&quot;, that means &quot;it&#039;s in transit&quot;, like &quot;in the mail&quot; and as such shouldn&#039;t really be cancellable.&nbsp; However, I&#039;m new here and I&#039;d like some etiquette guidance?&nbsp; Am I wrong in feeling a bit annoyed?&nbsp; Now it&#039;s a day later and I&#039;m a day closer to being out, even if I go with someone else who ships as quickly (as far as I can tell, nobody ships as quickly).<br /><br />I&#039;ve never autofinalized, always finalized within an hour of receiving a parcel, and am always effusive (but truthful) with my praise in feedback.&nbsp; Is this a &quot;one of those things&quot; kind of things, or am I right to be a bit miffed?

				it kinda pisses me off if a vendor does that early and then you are expecting package and dont get one. but what you gonna do its probably for organization anyway to see how many orders have been done..i dont know about cancelling after putting it in transit i&#039;ve never had that happen but theres not too much you can do..

				Not being a vendor, I don&#039;t know how it works from their PoV - but perhaps part of the problem is that they don&#039;t have any means of marking orders that they have in progress from those that are dispatched?<br /><br />If so, perhaps there should be an additional state...<br /><br />1. Order placed / new / pending<br /><br />2. (once vendor has accessed order details) Order in progress / processing<br /><br />3. (once vendor confirms dispatch) In transit<br /><br />4. (once buyer confirms receipt) Finalized<br /><br />If they do have such a mechanism, perhaps it would be helpful for the intermediate status to be visible to the buyer?
