				Hey all.&nbsp; I have been loving my GHB lately for a nice buzz that leads me into a restful sleep after the effects start to fade.&nbsp; I am scared of it now though because of horror stories of it getting people in heaps of trouble w/ its date rape bullshit.<br /><br />I want to have a rotation of say Xanax, weed on occasion, and possibly Ketamine or MXE for a nice little high before bed.&nbsp; If I want to take one of these two like 2 hours before bed, which one will allow me to sleep and wake 8 hours later ready to go to work?<br /><br />Also considering adding vicodins and soma into my rotation, but this question is particuly about Keta vs MXE because they sound like my fun GHB trips.&nbsp; I am kind of leaning Keta because of its much shorter duration, but not sure if it will keep me up all night?

				I would not suggest MXE before bed, for me it lasts too long and not restful at all.&nbsp; Ketamine would be better, but still the possibility of some CEVs before nodding off.&nbsp; My top 3 in order&nbsp; - for ease of sleep - would be Benzos, Weed, then Opiates.&nbsp; Lots of OTC stuff could be used to knock you out though....just watch what you mix.

				So for a rotation (5 days a week, different drug each night to relax and fall asleep)<br /><br />would this work: Xanax (takes me 3-4 fucking mg to make me tired enough to sleep), vicodin, soma, tramadol, and maybe occasional 1,4 butanediol (I know this is hard on the liver but to use it every once in awhile harm should be minimum) and then good old fashion alcohol on the weekends?&nbsp; I am looking for a rotation for my 5 nights a week that feels good but allows me to rest good for my 9 hour shift each day Monday-Friday.

				Yeah I honestly have to come down completely off K before I can fall asleep. Usually takes me about 1.5-2 hours. This is puzzling considering I can usually sleep while coming down on LSD. I guess you&#039;re gonna have to try them all and find out. But yeah I would not recomend MXE.&nbsp; Hope it helps but honestly were all built different.

				MXE for sleep?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />MXE can actually prevent sleep. I usually allow for ~4 hours after my last MXE dose of the night before expecting to be able to sleep at all.

				MXE is more of a &quot;pass out&quot; drug than a sleeping aid. Plus, you might get side effects like vertigo for the next 1-2 days depending on how much you take. I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea to pop mxe like you would xanax, they&#039;re just way too different.

				Er... I&#039;ve done a lot of MXE, but no K. If K is anything like MXE, then it&#039;ll fuck with your sleep bigtime. I would not suggest using these drugs before going to bed, if you have work in the morning.

				Alcohol and benzo&#039;s react exactly the same in your brain. Using drugs to sleep most nights of the week will fuck you up if you ever want to sleep without meds. I have a script for Mirtazapine, 30mg. One of those an hour before bed works a treat, and they&#039;re not tolerance developing or physically addictive.

				I hear propofol is good.<br /><br />Or, you know, occasional melatonin with good sleep habits and prescription sleep aids as a last resort.

				You can&#039;t sleep on MXE, it actually keeps you awake. Its the first dissociative i&#039;ve encountered with such an intense anti-sleep effect actually. The only way you could possibly think you&#039;re sleeping on this stuff, is if you&#039;re actually just tripping so hard you&#039;re hardly conscious. <br /><br />Ketamine won&#039;t put you to sleep either, but it might relax you enough to fall asleep nicely after it wears off.<br /><br />Diazepam is the one for me though - no tripping, just good old Z&#039;s
