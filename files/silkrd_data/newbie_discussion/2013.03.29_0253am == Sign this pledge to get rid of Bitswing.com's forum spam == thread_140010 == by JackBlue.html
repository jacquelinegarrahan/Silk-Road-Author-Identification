				I appreciate the sentiment, but the bitcoin spammers don&#039;t actually read posts here.&nbsp; Or in any other forum that they spam.&nbsp; <br /><br />They are well-known scammers/spammers and their spam is taken care of as quickly as possible.

				Really appreciate that, JackBlue.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I try to help out as much as I can, and between myself and the other mod, samesamebutdifferent, we&#039;re here as much as we can be .. but there are certainly times when the spammers hit and we&#039;re not here.&nbsp; In those cases, rest assured that one of us will be along as quickly as possible to take care of it.&nbsp; :)
