				The title of the post pretty much says it all. I am looking for a legitimate connection on LSD. I rarely see people selling sheets, and when I do.. they are ridiculous in price. I am a Vendor who has over 200 transactions in 21ish days.. So I get a lot of traffic. (which means this would be for resale, but if the L is good.. they will come.) and I would be interested in buying multiple sheets at a time. <br /><br />Maybe someone would like to talk some business? <br /><br />Or point me in the right direction.. &gt;&gt;&gt;

				You might want to check out Envious, he&#039;s a legit longtime vendor with a spotless rep. He currently is only selling AL-LAD, a close analogue of LSD; it&#039;s really good and clean stuff, at a great price. The effect is pretty much indistinguishable from LSD, maybe a little shorter. He seems to have quantity and other vendors are re-selling his stuff with abandon, so it seems like it would be easy to move.

				Are you suggesting he passes off 25-i for something else? I can confidently say this stuff is not even similar to the N-Bomb, that&#039;s a phenethylamine drug, I have had plenty of both and the difference is pretty big. He sells AL-LAD, a rare tryptamine which is almost exactly like LSD. <br /><br />I just mentioned it since I&#039;ve tried it and can vouch for it, and it is a good deal. I have heard nothing but good things about Alaska too but have not tried his stuff, and his listings have gone away for the moment. Acid dealers seem to come and go with the wind on SR. Hope you find a supplier.

				so what exactly is 25-I-NOBMe? is it a simliar to LSD? or is it another one of the RCs from the past few years?<br /><br />Also, ALD-25, is just LSD that doesnt have the finishing step, so to speak, correct? I&#039;m a little out of touch with all my drugs. That&#039;s what happens when you get a few years under your belt: you start forgetting all the minute differences between the drugs. plus it seems like the number of drugs multiplies every year

				The NBOME series, commonly called 25-b, 25-c, and 25-i are RCs of the phenethylamine group which includes 2cb, ecstasy, amphetamines and most of the other RCs of recent times and have effects somewhat similar to both ecstasy and LSD simultaneously. They are very powerful by weight and as such are frequently sold on similar blotters to acid; as these chemicals are dirt cheap, unscrupulous street dealers often try to pass them off as acid for much more than they are worth. And a lot of inexperienced users can&#039;t tell the difference. LSD and many other &quot;traditional&quot; psychedelics like mescaline, psilocybin and DMT are from a wholly unrelated group called tryptamines. NBOMEs are still tons of fun, they have some crazy properties, just be aware you can get a whole sheet for like $50! <br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe<br /><br />As for the AL-LAD, I don&#039;t know the specifics of its manufacture but it is one of several possible analogues to LSD. It was discovered by the famed chemist Alexander Shulgin.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin
