				Hey this may be a dumb Q. I write this with full knowledge that it may backfire just to ask. Im trying to figure out why im getting so much negative karma points on posts and replies. I am contributing regularly to the forums and making helpful replies in my mind but the negative Karma keeps adding up. I know only members w 100+ posts can give it so what am i doin wrong? Would really appreciate a look and quick analysis if anyone willing to help. i am prepared for the criticism (hopefully positive). i really just want to be a positive influence in the community. Thanks.

				Hard to tell dude, some members give negs just because they can..but as many as you have as opposed to your positives, its likely that the advice youve given is that which is frowned upon. Ill help as best i can with a +1...&nbsp;

				You really shouldn&#039;t worry too much about it ...... I picked up 2 in one night for participating in the &quot; SCAMMER ALERT&quot; thread. And yeah it was pretty irritating at first because I felt like everything I said was constructive and fair. But somebody didn&#039;t like it and popped me on a single night ...... In your case I would agree that some dick is nailing your ass every time&nbsp; he sees your profile. Nothing you can do ....... trolls will be trolls ...... Admin should limit the number of times you can hit a guy to 2 good or bad...

				Hi I,ve read your 1st page of posts and can,t work out from them why you,d have any neg (tho i,ve not looked at them all). You write well and the posts aren,t trolly or nasty there are just some neg karma trolls on any forum i guess&nbsp; :-\ Don,t worry I,ve had a few opinions i,d rather voice them and take neg karma than stay quiet and not have an opinion, you,ll never please everyone and everyone has there own opinion, just stay true to what you want to say, don,t give a fuck about neg karma or you can go to off topic and you,ll find the plus karma thread, even tho you don,t have 100 posts yet you,ll still get karma from other nice people in there and when you get to 100 you can give out your own karma&nbsp; ;D I,ll +1 you now pal your posts were fine and your nice&nbsp; ;)

				Yeah I got 2 negative ones. Not even sure why. I spammed up to 50 (Just posting numbers) but since then I think I&#039;ve been pretty respectful (If you look through my past 7 posts). It irked me a bit but it&#039;s just one of those things I suppose. If I solidify myself as a regular and post advice I reckon I&#039;ll get more positives.

				Don&#039;t worry too much - a lot of us are getting negged about 14 times over the course of a few minutes every day.&nbsp; Even DPR and inigo who don&#039;t post often at all.&nbsp; We&#039;ve reported the issue to DPR, but I have a feeling it&#039;s just something that we&#039;ll have to live with.&nbsp; <br /><br />:(

				scout, you made your point, but everywhere I post there you are in seconds. You and Lib locked 2 threads today about negging and your reasons were not fantastic. You didn;t let me reply to your FUD, you just posted that which I feel was a personal attack on a member and then locked it. I am not here to argue, I am here to help. More than I can say for samesame. Anyway, don&#039;t make this personal as I need to get back to posting and +1 people in this section to counteract their negs.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />(sad to see someone in your position push those conspiracy theories, I thought you were more intelligent than to subscribe to that crap.)

				The reason I have locked the other threads is because they just devolve into your long-winded conspiracy theories about how SSBD negged PrincessHIGH - which he did NOT do.&nbsp; You are the one making this personal by accusing the moderators (particularly SSBD) of this childish bullshit and trying to convince everyone else to believe it.&nbsp; You attack him and then expect no one to come to his defense?&nbsp; Come now, it is no different than you sticking up for PrincessHIGH when she was negged.&nbsp; You defended her just like I am defending SSBD.&nbsp; PrincessHIGH (and others) did not deserve the mass-negging (no one does) - and SSBD does not deserve the attacks you have made on him either.<br /><br />He does a damn good job here, as does Libertas, and I won&#039;t sit idly by while SSBD is accused of things he didn&#039;t do.<br /><br />Not everything that happens here on SR is some grand team-agenda.&nbsp; :-\
