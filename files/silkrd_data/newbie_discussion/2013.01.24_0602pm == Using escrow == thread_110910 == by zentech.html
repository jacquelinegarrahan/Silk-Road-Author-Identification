				What stage are you at - you deposited btc - did it show in your balance?&nbsp; <br /><br />If not, how long ago did you deposit?<br />If it did, have you made a purchase yet and what steps did you take to do it?

				When you place an order, it will move from your available balance into one of the escrow balances. Either $ if hedged, or ฿ if unhedged. When you finalise, the vendor actually gets the money.

				No worries, enjoy your drugs :)&nbsp; As for whether you finalize early, you shouldn&#039;t have to, but if you are a new customer you are untrusted so many vendors will ask you to finalize early before they ship.&nbsp; Up to you whether you take the risk.&nbsp; Best to build up your transactions with well known, well-vouched for vendors rather than mysterious uncommunicative vendors who have bad feedback.&nbsp; These forums are great for that, obviously.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have fun :)

				I would HIGHLY suggest to NEVER FE, there are numerous vendors for every drug that will not require newbies to FE. if someone does ask for you to FE just move onto the next vendor. There have been a tremendous number of scams done by vendors where they get you to FE then you are out of luck and it can not be reversed. There used to be a thread(not sure if its still there) that was boycotting FE and I suggest you take a look at it as it has many educated, experienced buyers and vendors posting in it who can provide you with any information you&#039;d like. There really is no reason to FE. If the vendor is an honest vendor they should be fine with doing business the way SR set it up to be done. Escrow is there to protect both the buyer and vendor. In fact it is maybe the only thing protecting the buyer. We are the ones most at risk since we have to give them our address(or wherever you send it) while they don&#039;t have to reveal any information what-so-ever. Make sure you check the forums on a vendor that you are gonna try out to see how their reputation is and you can also find many reviews too! Sometimes if it&#039;s too good to be true, it is. Us buyers have to stick together and look out for one another so that we can keep the scamming down to a minimum. Safe roading! Never be afraid to ask a question either, some people on here like to attack those who ask a &quot;dumb&quot; question but who are they to determine it&#039;s a dumb question. We all have different experiences on SR and by sharing them we&#039;ll all be helping each other out. <br /><br />Good luck!

				What zebruh said is correct, you shouldn&#039;t have to.&nbsp; I&#039;m not suggesting you should finalize early - just there is a flipside where honest vendors who get scammed by multiple throwaway accounts sometimes put these restrictions in place for their own protection.&nbsp; Understandable, but then it makes it a riskier business for an honest buyer new to the site as they don&#039;t know who to trust and get put in a position of having no money and possibly no product.<br /><br />I know when I joined I just had to FE for the first three or so orders and from then on it has been plain sailing.&nbsp; However yes - I&#039;m not saying you should FE.&nbsp; You can&#039;t really get scammed if you never FE, so it makes sense for a buyer to never to do so.&nbsp; It&#039;s just this place isn&#039;t only about the buyer.&nbsp; There are scammers on both sides of the fence and they make life harder for the honest ones.&nbsp; However I&#039;m kind of surprised at the high level of integrity amongst many members, before I got here I was imagining a complete wild-west.&nbsp; And it is, but mostly a civil one with decent people.&nbsp; Just a few assholes playing tricks hiding amongst them :)

I FE&#039;d on my first order but that was just to get free shipping and I nearly gave myself an ulcer wondering if I just voluntarily handed my money over to them, however the vendor was an honest one and I received my first package and was very happy with it! I agree with you about there being scammers on both ends and I do understand why a vendor would say that newbies need to FE, it&#039;s just a preference I suppose and the way I look at it is if the vendor has a good product and has an outstanding track record, why need anyone to FE? Just treat them like a normal customer and carry on with business. Again, that&#039;s just how I feel, its always up to you if you want to FE or not. I too imagined that this place would be unruly and that there would be a bunch of low life people trying to rip me off. I&#039;m happy to say that from all the orders I&#039;ve placed on here I&#039;ve only had to deal with 1 bad vendor who tried scamming. Overall I&#039;ve been happy with my experiences on SR and I hope you will be too!

				Not dealers, vendors. And yes, there are quite a few of them.&nbsp; There&#039;s some information on it stickied on this forum and many of them in the security forum.&nbsp; Navigate into the security section and then use the search bar at the top right of the page.&nbsp;

				PGP can be a real PITA to learn at first but once you get it down its pretty simple. Took me longer to figure out pgp than actually get my cash onto SR :(
