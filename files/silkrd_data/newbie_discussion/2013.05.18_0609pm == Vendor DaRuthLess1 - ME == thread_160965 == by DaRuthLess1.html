				I have been selling on the road for 5 months an thought it was time I came onto the forums an made more of a name for myself since my consumers seem to think I need to &quot; come out behind the shadows an show other vendors how to operate properly &quot;&nbsp; Those weren&#039;t my words but my consumers. So I am here just to introduce myself an get my posts up so that I can post in my own review thread.<br /><br />Thanks<br />DR1

				I would not recommend buying from DaRuthless1 if you place any kind of weight on customer service. Over the 50+ transactions here I&#039;ve had here I&#039;ve had some unpleasant ones, but this guy takes the cake for assholery (short of the outright scammers). I would say he does the bare minimum SR requires of him and not one bit more. If you want a nice vendor to deal with look for someone else, there&#039;s plenty of people who have his prices or better and actually give a fuck about customers.

				Wow. Just wow! Whoever said DaRuthless1 is Rxking is fucking nuts! I know both of them, and have done business with both of them.. and I can assure you they are 2 different people entirely. Also, DR1 is NOT a scammer at all. In fact, he&#039;s one of the most generous and professional vendors I&#039;ve ever done business with on the road. Obviously some pathetic, jealous vendor is trying to stir shit up. So, so sad..

His prices aren&#039;t even anything to be jealous of. If you read my post I never claimed that he was a scammer, just very unpleasant to deal with, inflexible, and not worth the trouble. Just putting this info out to help other buyers who may be in the same situation. I for one wish I had that information before choosing him to buy from, I would have made a better choice and would have avoided some nasty withdrawal for one.

So your not 100% wrong colorblack but I know I can be a jerk sometimes, Every vendor can be since we deal with way more stress then the consumers plus I don&#039;t see any other vendors out there shipping the next day, Matter fact every buyer who use to buy from someone else tells me how bad the experience was because they would have to wait 3 days before even having their order confirmed so to mister mkrzay or whatever your handle is your not paying for a product your paying for the service... Its about the quality of life my friend. Thanks colorblack for the chiming in.

Like I said, I never said he was a scammer, but it&#039;s hard to imagine a worse vendor without it being a scammer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m going to respond to your long rambling post section by section. First of all, referring to DaRuthless1 as &quot;this fucker&quot; is rude and although I understand you&#039;re going into widthdrawls as you mention (more on that in a bit).. speaking like a RUDE junkie will get you no sympathy on this forum.<br /><br />1) Every single vendor who offers Express Shipping on Silk Road state their shipping time frame. Most of them give a time frame and a cutoff for when it ships. DR1 does do that. His vendor page says &quot;ALL ORDERS ARE USUALLY SHIPPED WITHIN 12-24 HOURS (EXCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS)&quot;. You understand the world usually does not mean &quot;ABSOLUTELY&quot;, right? Sometimes shit happens in real life that vendors have to take care of. YOU might have all the free time in the world, but vendors are often busy and have dozens of orders a day to process, ship, track, (all while constantly having to deal with cashing out bitcoins to real world currency, re-upping on their product, etc). Usually means usually. In my personal experiences, I&#039;ve had vendors ship the same day, I&#039;ve had vendors ship the next day. No problem, that&#039;s how it works. Lot&#039;s vendors don&#039;t ship for 2 or 3 days. In fact, Silk Road&#039;s built in ordering system allows the vendor a few days before they mark it &quot;In Transit&quot; or else a buyer can cancel his/her order. These are humans on the other end of your order, not robots.<br /><br />2) Nobody here gives half a fuck about your moving, having to carry boxes, or your widthdrawls. That&#039;s all your personal life that has no bearing on a vendor or their operation. Talking about carrying heavy boxes while being dope sick and crying about it.. are you a woman? That would explain the tone of your post. If you&#039;re a chick, then forgive me.. I can understand. My girlfriend also whines like that sometime. But if you&#039;re not a woman, your moving and the subsequent &quot;lifting of heavy boxes&quot; is so beyond ridiculously irrelevant that the only reason I&#039;m even bothering to address it is because it&#039;s kind of funny. And anyways, it&#039;s good you had to do some heavy lifting. Excercise is healthy for you bro. You know I&#039;ve moved a few times... and you know what I did after I had to move around boxes full of my own shit? Nothing. I did nothing. I didn&#039;t complain about it on a forum. So this part is really irrelevant.<br /><br />3) Again you&#039;re referring to his &quot;ALL ORDERS ARE USUALLY SHIPPED WITHIN 12-24 HOURS&quot; text as a &quot;promise&quot;. How is that a &quot;promise&quot; in any sense of the word? A PROMISE? It&#039;s a fucking ESTIMATE. Vendors are NOT BOUND by their shipping ESTIMATES, and if they right the word &quot;USUALLY&quot; it means &quot;USUALLY&quot;. Now, if DR1&#039;s vendor page said &quot;ALL ORDERS ARE ALWAYS SHIPPED WITHIN 12-24 HOURS (EXCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS) I FUCKING PINKY PROMISE&quot;, then you would have a legtimate complaint. Until it says that, you are wrong to complain. Maybe the tone of your private message was obnoxious, and that&#039;s why he got offended. Maybe you were whining about having to lift heavy objects and being dopesick (much like you&#039;ve done here) rubbed him wrong. You are not entitled to anything. You&#039;re a customer buying drugs. You&#039;ve got lots of options of other vendors, this is a free market, and it goes both ways. Maybe DR1 was having a bad day, maybe he was busy, maybe fucking anything. Maybe HE WAS MOVING HEAVY BOXES that day LOL! Maybe you sounded like a cop. Are you cop? You know you gotta tell us if I ask, cops can&#039;t lie.. you know that right? LOL. All jokes aside.. this is a free market. A vendor can cancel an order when they smell something off. The same way a buyer can choose not to do business with a vendor. Did I mention this was a free market? Again you mention the dreaded doomsday of your moving (and why didn&#039;t you hire Uhaul, asshole? Or some amigos from the street corner?), again irrelevant.<br /><br />Again you&#039;re talking about rights. There are no RIGHTS here unless you&#039;ve entered into a transaction with a vendor. Once you&#039;ve entered a transaction, and it&#039;s in transit, then both you and the vendor have equal rights. You&#039;ve got the right to receive your order as per the shipping you&#039;ve paid for, in a timely manner (dependant on USPS), and the vendor has a right to be paid immediately upon you receiving your order. Any deviation for that leads to bad blood, possible resolution disputes, and other drama. <br /><br />You are complaining that DR1&#039;s prices for Express shipping.. yet you didn&#039;t have an issue with the price of shipping, and in fact you even offered foolishly to FINALIZE EARLY on your offer. So then why is the shipping price a problem now? It wasnt a problem when you were placing the order or offering to FE? (Which, might I add, he didn&#039;t event take you up on.. which speaks for his professionalism). Most vendors would JUMP on an FE because it keeps their funds from being tied up.<br /><br />A vendor has the right to do business with anyone they want, just like you have the right as a customer to do business with whoever you want. But you&#039;re complaining about all the wrong reasons. You&#039;re complaining because you were dopesick and couldn&#039;t lift heavy boxes, and that is not the vendor&#039;s fault.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had over 20-25 transactions with DR1 in 2 months. EVERY single transaction has been smooth, pleasant communication, efficient, fast, rock solid professionalism, promotional deals that have been cheapest on Silk Road, generous, courteous, and everything else that goes with being a perfect vendor. I&#039;ve had special requests, I&#039;ve fucked up and not responded, you name it.. yet DR1 accomodated everything as much as he humanly could, and has gone way beyond for me (and other customers I&#039;ve spoken to who&#039;s done business with him) without FAIL. <br /><br />Read his reviews and feedback. They are perfect. So, to refer to this established vendor as &quot;this fucker&quot; and to say he&#039;s as worst as it get&#039;s without being a &quot;scammer&quot; is outrageous, wrong, and a lie. <br /><br />Moral of the story, if you&#039;re a buyer looking for the best Roxies, priced the best, delivered lighting fast, occasionally get a goodie for free, perfect stealth, communication.. then look no further then DaRuthless1. **<br /><br />If you&#039;re a whiny ass woman, or a man so pathetic that he feels that moving boxes of his own shit is a Herculean task that somehow entitles him to drugs delivered to his new address/old address within minutes... then DR1 probably isn&#039;t your guy.<br /><br /><br />** Disclaimer: DaRuthless1 has made his rules stricter lately (probably due to people like the chick who posted this crap above me). If you&#039;re new, if you&#039;re got less then X amount of buys, or if you&#039;re not a previous customer, or if you just come across as &#039;off&#039; (complaining about your widthrawls and living situation is definetly a no-no), he will NOT do business with you. And that&#039;s really your loss, because he&#039;s the fastest/cheapest Roxy &amp; Suboxone &amp; soon to be premium coke vendor on Silk Road. Although, if you&#039;re worthy, talk to me and I&#039;ll put in a good word for ya and he might just do business with you ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

No one said I was a saint an now I remember who you are! You do NOT have 2 years on the road because if you did you would have been on the forums way before this an have way more then 16 posts, With that said I remember you needed it sent to your home an you were moving an needed it to the old home an I didn&#039;t want to be at fault if the package didn&#039;t make it there because of USPS, Not because of me not sending it out.... Every vendor can tell you that yes 90% of them when you ship express it will get there the next day but that 10% really screws us when people like you NEED to have them right then an there an stomp there feet like you are doing when they don&#039;t get there way. Also shipping is shipping dude don&#039;t bitch about it.<br /><br />SO why don&#039;t you stop being mad that I refuse to do business with you an move on man, There was something fishy about you an I didn&#039;t need the headache an saw it coming from a mile away. I bet I wouldn&#039;t have 100% feedback if I would have taken your order since your the type of consumer who will bitch about the smallest thing like the mailman came at 5PM an not 3PM... So i&#039;m happy I never accepted you as a buyer but I guess I am doing something wrong since my product is #1 in the prescriptions section...<br /><br />Also thanks colorblack, Now you understand the bs I deal with an why I hate dealing with morons..<br /><br /><br />Also FYI mister you shouldn&#039;t wait to the last second to get your suboxone.... A true pill head knows to have it all planned out but YOU want to break MY balls about them having to be there the VERY NEXT DAY, So stop hijacking this thread with non-sense... Also don&#039;t make me have my followers come in an rip you a new one just like colorblack did, Your not even in my review thread this was a thread made to get my posts up lol

				So, I continue to wait, but still nothing.&nbsp; I normally wouldn&#039;t even be concerned but with all the shit going back and forth about this vendor, one would have to be skeptical.<br /><br />Last I heard they said they did not send out my stuff via Express, but Priority.&nbsp; Again, all these signs point to being screwed.<br /><br />I&#039;m not so worried about losing the money, as that&#039;s my fault, but more so about losing three days and now need a HP pretty bad because of how low we are.<br /><br />Also, they haven&#039;t read my message from 17 hours ago.&nbsp; Anyone have some lube for me?&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Oh well, lesson learned.&nbsp; I&#039;m never, ever doing an FE AGAIN!<br /><br />If it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck...

				Hey, they were communicating, but not to me since yesterday whereas it was almost instantaneous prior.<br /><br />None of their feedback, at least last time I checked, has any product arriving - just FE for trusted vendor.&nbsp; At this point I would think they posted a product arriving themselves.<br /><br />My guess, and it makes logical sense, that they&#039;ll close up shop with everyone&#039;s money, and reopen as a new vendor.<br /><br />If I&#039;m wrong, and we get our product, I&#039;ll make a big apology, but I doubt it.

				DaRuthless1 is just that - NO GOOD.&nbsp; I won&#039;t go into details, but I was fortunate to escape his web without providing an address.&nbsp; I&#039;m mystified as to how he keeps good ratings. STAY AWAY and NEVER FE

The only time i have posted about DR1 was to warn about his obv scam. I know they are not the same person because I used Rxking to get coins a few days ago, I considered using those coins to get some GSC from DR1 when his &quot;sale&quot; had just begun but only if he would let me stay in escrow. He wouldnt, insisting that if i order i must FE. Now if they were the same person RXK could have just kept my WU and not have to worry about tricking me into buying a FE listing. Therefore they are not the same person. DUCY?

				add me to whatever list you would like. No one in their right mind would take you seriously. You obviously have a hard on for RxKing. Why dont you post under your original forum name?<br /><br />Edit: I just realized what you were saying about google caches......... Why do you have to make things up, if you show me a google cache of a post that I editied where I was supporting DR1 I will send you 200 bucs. Why make shit up? You must be really bored. Go ahead post the proof and the 200 dollars is yours. <br /><br /><br />Ill wait ...........
