I&#039;ll trust his advice!<br />*So some don&#039;t like those sketchy LE posts.&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; Glad the door was locked!&nbsp; :o Oh shit, nah I forgot this forum was not a newbie forum but the &quot;Path to Fifty or Higher&quot; Forum.<br />*Not ranting.&nbsp; SERIOUSLY.&nbsp; What is the point of a newbie forum?&nbsp; It is idealogically sound by its premise to **Help new members**, but just like all other politically correct bullshit, it is *mostly NOT being used as such but is a JOKE.&nbsp; WHY EVEN HAVE THIS FORUM since quality is being trumped by quantity (relative to posts)<br />******** AN HONEST QUESTION FROM A LOGICAL-MINDED MEMBER. If you have enough clout, maybe repost this on the Discussion Thread for me, or Security Thread since I cannot.&nbsp; It would take me 15-30 minutes more possibly.&nbsp; Ding the karma I do not care.&nbsp; Man up and say you did so.&nbsp; It is a sensible question,<br />I appreciate all sensible replies, positive or negative, and the humor from unsensible ones. <br />Hope to see this *Higher up the food-chain* for a true debate.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

Tips and tricks to stay out of trouble, that sort of thing.<br /><br />Although I suppose not everybody is as paranoid as I am.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I totally agree the newbie section should be where people figure things out, and learn how to cover their asses in case they do something stupid and get into trouble. Right now its just spam like crazy to get to 50 so that you can go post and annoy the shit out of the knowledgeable users.<br /><br />I think I know a decent amount I&#039;ve been reading the security thread for more than 4 months. If you have a question PM me and I&#039;ll see if I can help you.<br /><br />This 50 posts thing needs to be changed to a set of challenges that are measured like:<br /><br />1) a timer that records time spent in the forums. It also stops counting if you stay on the same page for more than an hour, you have to been scrolling through threads otherwise the clock doesn&#039;t move. This is so people can&#039;t just leave their comp on all day and reach the max time.<br /><br />2) There is also a counter for how many replies are written and how many times you quote someone other than yourself. This is to encourage an actual convo between users.<br /><br />3) They must accumulate a certain number of karma points. This is to establish that they try to help others and are not a forum troll. Like the dude who started a thread the other day about which race was the stupidest. If he needs good karma to get to the rest of the forum he wouldn&#039;t write that. Making threads like that can be fun, but they almost always turn into flame wars.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, well said sir.&nbsp; <br />Update to &quot;PLACE SPAM HERE TO GET TO 50&quot; THREAD--&gt; 26,661 replies/31,137 views<br />Poor newbie with a good question about something pertinent.&nbsp; Only 9 replies, 14 views....&nbsp; What is spam again?&nbsp; -1 for sounding negative? IDK... just conversing.&nbsp; Seems logical all I have said.&nbsp;

				I agree that spam threads are crap. I rather enjoyed my stay in the newbie forums. Discussions were playful and lively. It felt more anonymous than the regular forums (one had yet to create a forum-persona). A great place where you can embarrass yourself a bit, acclimatize to the forums, without receiving negative karma. I think that it would be sensible to refrain from giving negative karma to anyone in the newbie forums that aren&#039;t actively spamming or acting like total assholes.

				I agree with Icon. It would take me forever of posting constructively to actually get to 50. there have been about 5 instances of me wanting to post since I registered in January, but when I want to post I really want to post. I do however spend a very long time reading threads, and wouldn&#039;t want to post if I didn&#039;t think it was of some value. But I really don&#039;t care about anything other than review threads.
