				My impression from lurking is that the likelihood that you will be subjected to a controlled delivery — in which case the presence of any marijuana or paraphernalia would land you up shit creek without a paddle — is pretty low if you&#039;re just buying small amounts. It would be a considerable waste of resources on the part of law enforcement to go after you, considering there is no way you could lead them up the foodchain to the dealers that they really want to catch.<br /><br />With international shipments, it&#039;s more likely that your import will be caught, but the standard procedure is for Customs to send you a &#039;love letter&#039; telling you to knock that shit out.<br /><br />Low risk does not mean no risk, however. You&#039;ll have to choose between the anxiety that you might get busted and the hassle of keeping your house weed-free.<br /><br />You could also try sending to a friend, if you&#039;ve got friends with clean premises who don&#039;t mind receiving your goods.

You NEVER hear about it on the news either. Sure you hear about some crazy guy that shoots a few people in a public venue but never when that guy is a fed. Not to mention they think they can get away with anything they fucking please and that &quot;serve and protect&quot; means we serve them for protection from who else but them. Then all this shit in Boston to top it off.

				Probably not the best idea to be buying that much weight internationally if paranoia is an issue for you. Is it really worth it feeling like that all day? To each his own, I guess.
