				Anyone out there that can teach me how to jack cars, pickpocket, and shoplift? I&#039;d happily pay someone that could teach me how. <br />Oh, and I should add picking locks/breaking and entering to that list.

				You should re-evaluate your life and your goals. Regardless of your reasons for wanting to learn how to be a thief your life is going to suck if you keep on this track. You will get caught at some point and you will go to jail/prison and it will get worse from there. Plus as someone else said you are going to give users a bad name. I am here to get things I want that the gov&#039;t doesn&#039;t want me to have. I am free to put things in my body because it&#039;s mine and no one has the right to deny me that because of their morals or beliefs. As long as I am not causing harm to anyone else it&#039;s my business. You will be causing harm to others and if you are looking to make money to buy drugs by stealing you are harming others and you have crossed a line that goes against what SR is trying to do by having this site. It&#039;s about freedom; personal freedom to enjoy things that others want to deny us. You might as well asked to have someone teach you how to be a vendor who scams his customers. That would not be received well by most of the SR community, with good reason. Find another way to get coin honestly where you aren&#039;t hurting other people. If you can&#039;t do that you are doomed to a life of pain, suffering and misery. But hey if that&#039;s what you want go ahead and do it but don&#039;t do it on SR.

Join a branch of the int services and learn from real pros or become an auto-didact with a roomful of locks - buy books here if you&#039;re unable to download them for free.<br /><br />Or best yet, download a load of books, rewrite them as one master manual, write yourself a fictitious and brief resume (&quot;after Watergate, I was unwelcome in int circles for 15 years...&quot;) and sell the book.<br /><br />But shoplifting? Really? Like tween girls stealing from costume jewelry shops? Best way is get a job in a retail warehouse.<br />
