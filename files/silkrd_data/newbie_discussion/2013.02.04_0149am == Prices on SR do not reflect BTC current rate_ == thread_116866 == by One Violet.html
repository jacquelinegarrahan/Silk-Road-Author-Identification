				I&#039;ve been following the Bitcoin rate change on Mt.Gox for 2 days and I have noticed the prices on SR stay the same, they don&#039;t change. Although, I&#039;ve only been watching a few listings. So, does SR not reflect the current rate of Bitcoin or are some vendors allowed to not follow the rate change?

				I understand your concern, but you have to understand that SR is an independent market, and the individual vendors decide whether they wanna change their prices according to the BTC prices every time there&#039;s a change. If you&#039;re looking at a certain item try PM&#039;ing the vendor asking him about the price.. Most of them are normal people who will understand your concern..<br /><br />But with that said, don&#039;t expect SR to follow the btc exchange market promtly.. everyone can&#039;t be online 24/7 adjusting prices accordingly.<br /><br />And there&#039;s usually plenty of vendors out there for whatever you could desire, so if you disagree with the price see if someone else can give you a better offer

				Thanks for the reply - the amount of spamming on the forum makes it impossible to respond to posts.<br /><br />I see, so it depends on the vendor. I guess that&#039;s fair.<br /><br />As for not expecting SR to be able to follow the btc exchange market, there is another marketplace like SR (not sure if I&#039;m allowed to mention it) that updates its rates automatically several times a day - hourly I believe. So it can be done. But then SR is bigger and more active than the other marketplace, so maybe that&#039;s where the difficulty lies in updating the rates.<br /><br />I had no idea that it was the vendors that decide whether to follow the rates or not. Good info. Thanks, and I&#039;ll be PM&#039;ing vendors from now on. :)
