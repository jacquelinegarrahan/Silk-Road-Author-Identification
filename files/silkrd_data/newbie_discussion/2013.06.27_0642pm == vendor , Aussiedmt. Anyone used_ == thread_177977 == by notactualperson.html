				Hi. Ive checked out this guy a few times, but cant bring myself to place an order.<br /><br />His product description is full of assumptions, half truths, or just lies, which makes it clear he doesnt understand his product, or atleast the source of his product. <br /><br />Here is the product description, followed by my problems with it.<br /><br />Hello, one of Australia&#039;s newest and best ;) DMT vendors here selling 250mg of a new batch of DMT crystals. Locally produced from Australian Maidens Wattle the Acacia maidenii . It is one of the best DMT producing plants on Earth. VERY RARE TO FIND. Google it if ya dont believe me :P<br />so it blows you&#039;re head off. So much better than Mimosa Hostilis Root Bark or MHRB. These Maiden Wattles are almost impossible to find anywhere in Oz and here in Oz is the only place it grows on Earth naturally. So in short, my DMT is from the best DMT producing plant in the world :)<br /><br />And i know my stuff may cost a little bit more, but the quality definitely justifies it. Have a look at the best selling DMT in the world on SR. you will see that I up there amongst the best of the best of all of SR. I know my DMT, it&#039;s all I sell ;)<br /><br />1. Acacia maidenni is the opposite of rare. So common infact that it is considered a noxious weed in my state, despite being native and the floral emblem of the state. Im looking out my window at one right now.<br /><br />2.Acacia maidenni is far from being one the best Dmt producing plants on earth.&nbsp; There are many acacias which are both far more potent and contain far less impurities. Hell there is a near extinct variety from the snowy mountains which produces DMT so potent it doesnt need even need extraction. <br /><br />Either he doesnt know his product and is making baseless assumptions or he is just full of shit. Makes me wonder if he knows what he&#039;s doing extraction wise or if he just makes that up as he goes too.<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br /><br />

				He gets a brief mention here ---&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120333.msg866465;topicseen#msg866465<br /><br />Otherwise his vendor feedback all looks good. His spiel might be a cut n paste from somewhere else without paying too much attention. Drug dealers are notorious for talking shit, spreading rumors that turn to myth, think of all the common misconceptions and where they came from, don&#039;t believe everything you hear or read! I wouldn&#039;t necessarily hold this against any vendor, perhaps his education suffered whilst he launched his drug empire haha<br /><br />I prefer vendors product listings to provide particulars rather than take a big chuck out of erowid that is only really relevant to someone finding out about the drug for the first time. I have NEVER got product that was any good from a vendor who does this - this is my tip on what to look out for ;)<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />SP
