				Title: <strong>Old Address Used</strong><br />

				I was wondering if anyone else had experience with deposits into an older account. I just deposited some BTC into my BTC address generated by the &quot;first_deposit&quot; link. However, upon reviewing the BTC address which I sent my coins to, I realized that this was the same address as what I used in January of this year. I have not sent BTC since January and was wondering if this deposit might be lost due to not generating a new BTC address. The deposit went through and now has &gt;30 confirmations. The coins have not moved from this address (and into SR tumbling). It has only been ~3 hours since the deposit.

				It&#039;s okay.&nbsp; Silk Road is currently experiencing minor deposit delays.&nbsp; Please contact SR support in 12 hours if the deposit still has not arrived and they will take care of it.

It took a little while but the addresses you use are yours, not reused, and you&#039;ll be fine.

				Yup, all past wallet addresses are linked to your SR account.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve got 2 different deposits currently pending (and being delayed due to the delays) to 2 different wallet addresses on my account, would this be a problem?
