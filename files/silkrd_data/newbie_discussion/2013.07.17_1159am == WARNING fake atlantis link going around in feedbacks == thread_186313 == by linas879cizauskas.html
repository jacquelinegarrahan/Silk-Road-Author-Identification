				Hi there, <br /><br />I am forum mod over at Atlantis and been trying to catch these now for a while, <br />If you registered or logged in through that link please contact SR support immediately and consider changing your passwords if you use the same ones on any other sites. <br />If you have an Atlantis account please get in touch with support there too.<br /><br />I&#039;ve now reported this to mods and asked the URL be added to the profanity/blacklist so it cant be re-posted<br /><br />Thanks and we are doing our best to nip these links in the bud<br /><br />H2.0

				No one should ever be clicking on any links posted here in the forums or sent via personal messages, especially given the sheer number of scams that have already been propagated via those mediums.<br /><br />Please take your online security seriously, today its a phishing link that may result in your SR wallet being emptied, tomorrow it could be malware or a key logger or some LE virus that de-anonymizes you.<br /><br />Please take this stuff seriously, just because you are using Tor you are not invincible.
