				I ordered an 8th of weed from a trusted vendor about 5 or 6 weeks ago. This wasn&#039;t my first order from SR and this mail man has been on my neighborhood route since January, which I had 3 orders delivered to my house since he took the route. I got the order just fine then he came back the next day to deliver the mail but he came to my door about 3 times I looked out the window and I could see him bending down at my door and making alot of noise. The last time he came to my door he was on the phone with someone and said &quot;I&#039;m at [said my address] on the corner&quot; then sat in his truck for about 10 minutes then drove off. Since then i&#039;ve been too scared to order anything from SR, should I stop ordering for a while? or is he messing with my head? the previous mail man never did this and&nbsp; i&#039;ve only ever ordered a max of 7gs

				He&#039;s probably just f&#039;ing around on the job. I&#039;ve seen mail delivers who have a combined driving/walking route sit on the phone with bluetooth the entire time sometimes swearing like a sailor. I don&#039;t know for sure but I don&#039;t think they have to be in a huge hurry. So probably sat in his truck for 10 minutes on the phone or just screwing around. AFIAK when they do something involving a mail delivery person it is not the normal mail delivery person but someone undercover dressed as such. So if it&#039;s your normal mail delivery dude maybe not so much to worry about, esp over 1/8th.
