				Barry Cooper is awesome. His videos are a must watch for pretty much anybody who does any sort of drugs. With that said I would offer one word of caution, he&#039;s a somewhat old school ex narco officer. Some of his info is a bit dated. For example, in his DVD &quot;Never Get Busted&quot; he explains that when he was a narco officer he worked the north and east bound lanes of the highway for drugs and the south and west bound lanes for money ( because this is how stuff was flowing to and from mexico). So one might think that it would be safer traveling the opposite direction with contraband. However I was talking to some state trooper buddies of mine and they explained that although this was the case back in the day, they now work both sides for the highway equally for drugs.

				Yeah some of those videos are a few years old and these days things change by the month. <br />But I found it really interesting the way he explained how dogs smell and detect, I think that might be useful info for some vendors. <br />He also has more youtube videos about how avoid detection when growing weed and other things like that. I didn&#039;t get a chance to watch everything but I definitely want to check out more of his stuff when I have time. His interview with Alex Jones looks interesting.

				You&#039;re welcome guys, hope people can get some useful info from this. <br />I didn&#039;t check pirate bay for the full movie yet but I plan to (he made 2 videos) but I found a bunch of stuff on Youtube.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s pretty cool that he was a really successful cop, and then stopped to actually THINK for himself and realize that what he was doing was wrong. <br />He said the US has 5% of the worlds population and 25% of the worlds prison population thanks to the war on drugs. I looked that up too: <br />(clearnet wiki) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In the 1980s, the rising number of people incarcerated as a result of the War on Drugs and the wave of privatization that occurred under the Reagan Administration saw the emergence of the for-profit prison industry. Prior to the 1980s, private prisons did not exist in the US.<br /><br />In a 2011 report by the ACLU, it is claimed that the rise of the for-profit prison industry is a &quot;major contributor&quot; to mass incarceration, along with bloated state budgets. Louisiana, for example, has the highest rate of incarceration in the world with the majority of its prisoners being housed in privatized, for-profit facilities. Such institutions could face bankruptcy without a steady influx of prisoners.<br /><br />Corporations who operate prisons, such as the Corrections Corporation of America and The GEO Group, spend significant amounts of money lobbying the federal government along with state governments.[67] The two aforementioned companies, the largest in the industry, are active members of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which lobbies for policies that would increase incarceration, such as three-strike laws and “truth-in-sentencing” legislation.<br />This influence on the government by the private prison industry has been referred to as the Prison–industrial complex.<br /><br />The industry is well aware of what reduced crime rates could mean to their bottom line. This from the CCA&#039;s SEC report in 2010:<br />&quot;Our growth … depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates …[R]eductions in crime rates … could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.&quot;&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This guy has great videos and are very informative for newbies.&nbsp; Most people react in shock when they become arrested, causing erratic behavior and saying things they should not have.

				If you implement some of Barry&#039;s tips with counter-intelligence/security techniques such as vaccum sealing and learn about the 1-5th amendment then you are a weapon in the war on drugs.
