				5/5 Really glad to have found NorCalKing!&nbsp; I placed my first SR order ever with NCK on Thursday (Purple Power).&nbsp; In the mail today I received my package.&nbsp; Great packaging!&nbsp; I just had my first rip...pretty sure it&#039;s going to be a little while before I bother with a second hit.<br /><br />Being the age I am, and in the profession I am in, it is extremely rare to find someone to supply what I want without unacceptable risk.&nbsp; I will always associate NCK as being my first SR vendor who made my first order &quot;perfect.&quot;&nbsp; It came quickly, safely and great quality! Thank you.<br /><br />I will be back....the THC Snow looks interesting.<br />&nbsp;

NCK is super professional and easy to communicate with. When I joined SR I thought that buying weed would be too risky on SR. not only did he destroy that myth but made me feel completely comfortable. It was one of the easiest orders that i have placed thus far. Just read his page and reviews.....<br />I haven&#039;t even received my order yet so i will follow up on the product, I just want all to know how pleasant and fun NCK is to do business with. <br /><br />NCK is a ray of warm Cali sunshine lighting up the Road&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Can anyone comment on the high of the purple power (95% sativa)?&nbsp; I usually stick to indicas, as sativas can be a bit too racy and intense for me sometimes, especially if I&#039;m not warned that it&#039;s a sativa dominant. A lot of them can be an awesome, almost mindfucking high, but I find that more often than not they just make me feel like I&#039;m on something almost speedy and like my heart&#039;s beating out of my chest. This PP has me interested though...<br /><br />Anyone who had it, do you know if the high was &quot;racy&quot; (as in feeling nervous, heart rate raised etc) or too intense for you? I really like a good sativa once in a while for a change from the usual &quot;stoned&quot; feeling, and especially to keep as a morning stash. Any input from people who have smoked it (or NCK himself) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

				Hey guys!&nbsp; Here is some of the more recent comments from happy customers.<br /><br /><br /><br />The bud took about 3 days to deliver to the east cost. The picture on the listing looks exactly like the bud I received. 10/10 look, taste, feel (compressed. Once grinded, very fluffy), and high. It&#039;s been 4 hours and I&#039;m still high.&nbsp; &nbsp;(GIRL SCOUT COOKIES!!! 1/8TH)<br /><br />Wow. I mean how good can an Indica get??? And what a flavor! Really glad I tried it!&nbsp; &nbsp;(AAAmazing 7.0 Grams of Grandaddy Purple)<br /><br />Oh look... there&#039;s a package in my mail box. And now my whole house smells like stank! WIN.<br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke so I can&#039;t weigh in on the quality but I&#039;m betting the wife will be happy when she gets back in town.&nbsp; &nbsp;(*** Sativa 14g Sour D ***)<br /><br />Coast to Coast in 3 days! After my first order I can see why they have a huge fan base. Order was 1st rate in EVERY respect! Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;(*** Sativa 14g Sour D ***)<br /><br />Truly the King! Perfect in every way! The Amazon of SR. Seriously.&nbsp; &nbsp;(7g *THC Snow* High THC Content)<br /><br />A flawless transaction. The fast response, fast shipping, super-stealth (best I&#039;ve seen!) and ultra-dank Girl Scout Cookies hold true to the insane quality of only the best NorCal bud. Weighed unexpectedly heavy(thank you so much!). This is a beautiful and potent specimen of GSC. NCK hooked it up! THANK YOU!&nbsp; &nbsp;(1/4 GIRL SCOUT COOKIES!!!)<br /><br />10/5 Excellent personable communication, hyper fast shipping, and the bud rivals the selection of So-Cal&#039;s finest medical dispensaries. What more could you hope or ask for?&nbsp; &nbsp;(14g THE Incredible OG KUSH The Happy Pain Killer!)<br /><br />Always Perfect. Repeat customer for a reason.&nbsp; &nbsp;(*** Sativa 14g Sour D ***)<br /><br />2 day shipping.... WHAT? That&#039;s from one part of the country to the whole other side. I&#039;ve NEVER had another vendor ship this fast. INSANE! Top notch GDP nugs and overweight as usual. NorCalKing is really holding it down with his herb. I keep coming back. I&#039;m addicted to his service, so... time for another order! 100/5&nbsp; &nbsp;(AAAmazing 3.5 g of GrandDaddyPurple!!!)<br /><br />This was my first order for NCK. .2 over weight, buds looked exactly like the picture.<br /><br />Best things about the order: The fastest shipping I&#039;ve ever gotten + the best packaging method for cannabis I&#039;ve ever seen. Top Notch - No need to sweat the packaging with this guy.&nbsp; &nbsp;(*** Sativa 7g Sour D ***)<br /><br />

				I think I&#039;m in love with NCK. This is from my very first order: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What can I say about NCK that hasn&#039;t already been said? Not only is the product out of control awesome, super stealthy packaging, LIGHTNING ship time, but the seller himself is a top-notch human being. I made my first order smack in the middle of the Great Coinbase Disaster of 2013, so my coins weren&#039;t hitting my SR wallet appropriately. This exceptional gentleman WENT AHEAD AND SENT ME OVER 4 GRAMS because we&#039;d been messaging for a while and he knew I wanted it for Valentine&#039;s Day sexy times. If I wasn&#039;t several states away, I&#039;d be sharing said sexy times with NCK for his unprecedented generosity and all-around coolness. I literally cannot say enough good things. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I realize that made me sound like a prostitute, which I&#039;m not, but my brain can&#039;t think of how to express gratitude in any scenario that isn&#039;t sexual. Yeah, I need therapy. Anyway, NCK just sent me a HUGE package of Girl Scout Cookie/Sour Diesel shake just to review. Just because. Honestly, it didn&#039;t even look like shake. There were some good size nugs in there and I had to search for stems/seeds. Dank as hell. Believe me, I will be getting out the thesaurus to actually review this shit because I don&#039;t know enough synonyms for &quot;awesome.&quot; Even my friends who have been hardcore all day every day smokers for 10+ years were impressed. LONG LIVE THE KING!

				Stealth was awesome as usual and shipping was quick. Have a 4 gram nug of the beautiful OG Kush here that is so thick and dense when you break it apart.&nbsp; There are tons of crystals that you&#039;ll soon notice and it sticks together well for rolling joints.&nbsp; It looks colorful and smells great, but even though there&#039;s really not much of a flavor when you hit it it&#039;s a pretty smooth smoke... and from the first time I exhaled it was about an hour until I felt like I wasn&#039;t really that high anymore after one bowl.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a heady high but even though I prefer an indica high you still get pretty ripped with this stuff.&nbsp; I can see why lots of people like it, but I&#039;m not sure why someone gave this a bad review... and I&#039;m sure most of you would agree that this is some bomb shit.&nbsp;

				The was my first SR transaction. Purple Power.<br /><br />Shipping: Ordered Sunday, arrived Thursday. That includes the down time on Monday. Packaged with enough cushion to to keep the product from getting squished.<br /><br />Stealth: I couldn&#039;t smell anything until I got to the last layer. Looked like fairly ordinary mail. Thick enough that you can&#039;t really feel the contents of the package very well. <br /><br />Quality: Great. I&#039;d been out of the smoking game for a while, but it got me feeling pretty good without requiring very much. Weight is right on.<br /><br />Communication: Responded quickly to the only message I sent.<br /><br />Would use NCK again!

				Im new here and even though my inquiries were not with NCK he still took the time to help me with my current issue. I thank him and others alike, for making this site what it is. With that said, i am a serious consumer, with numbers of up to 100 lbs last year. Operation has slowed down due to loss of product. I would like to become a reputable buyer, and one day possibly even a vender
