				When executing controlled deliveries, does LE always need to have the person sign for the package? Or can they leave it in your box, watch you pick it up, and then raid the home?

				I don&#039;t think we can say for certain, though all those we have heard about on here I believe did involve signing.<br /><br />Check out the sticky thread at the top of the &#039;Shipping&#039; subforum called &quot;Profiling postal package 101...&quot; which goes into some detail on the subject.

Why even contribute to say something fucking stupid like that? <br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t think it would matter too much. The signature COULD be used as an admission (if you sign it, you&#039;re taking possesion) but I believe they will watch your mailbox, watch you take it out and give you an hour or two to give you time to open it. Again, once you open a parcel, you&#039;re basically saying you were expecting it and you&#039;re taking possesion.<br /><br />Personally, I always pick it up, write &quot;return to sender-- unknown sender&quot;, get in my car and drive to the post office a few minutes later and see if I get followed or pulled over. The first thing they usually ask is &quot;where are you going?&quot; and I would say casually &quot;oh, i&#039;m just going to th post office&quot; without being so detailed and saying exactly what I&#039;m doing and why, etc etc. <br /><br />Basically they are going to have to follow you with the package because they need to prove you opened it so it&#039;s fairly easy to see if you&#039;re being tailed on the way.<br /><br />Anyone agree or disagree?

				Most common CD would involve LE getting dressed up like your mail man and asking you to sign for your package followed about 5 seconds later with the silver bracelets getting slapped on.<br /><br />A lot depends on the size of the order though, it is not unheard of to allow a detected order through and then place you under surveillance then bust you later, I only know on one verifiable case of this happening in Australia though and I&#039;m not sure if they would do it anywhere else.<br /><br />
