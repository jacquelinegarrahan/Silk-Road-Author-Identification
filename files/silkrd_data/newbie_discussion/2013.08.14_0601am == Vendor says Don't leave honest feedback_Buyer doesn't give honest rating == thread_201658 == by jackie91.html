				I came across this on a vendor profile:<br />&quot;You are required to give us a 5/5 rating as long as the package is delivered to you. Even if the product is not to your liking, you are required to leave a 5/5. This is very important to us, so if you cannot agree to this, then please do not order!&quot;<br /><br />I am not allowed to leave honest feedback? If the vendor takes forever to process my order, if the quality sucks, if the weight is under, I still have to leave a 5/5? (Example, not what really happened with this vendor, but keep reading) That is a disservice to the vendors who bust ass to provide excellent service and a good product. I am not going to abide by this insane rule. What will happen? The vendor will slam me in the vendors only forum? How is that different from the buyer who extorts a vendor?<br /><br />I saw a review on another vendors page where the buyer paid for Express shipping, didn&#039;t get their order for a week and then the weight was 75% of the promised weight and the buyer still left a 5/5. That skews the whole feedback and review process and doesn&#039;t serve the purpose of the feedback/review process. This isn&#039;t good for the exceptional vendors or the buyers who are trying to select the good vendors. A vendor supplies poor service/product and still has the same rating as the vendor who does it all correctly? Not good.<br /><br />The score whatever/5 is part of the feedback and should reflect the quality of the transaction. The score given should match the feedback. Vendors cannot demand a 5/5 if the transaction didn&#039;t deserve it and the buyers should leave honest and accurate feedback regardless of the fear of being slammed by the vendor.<br /><br />Vendors and buyers are going to make it difficult for buyers to make proper use of the feedback ratings if this continues.<br /><br />&nbsp;Member for: 7 months<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all time<br />total transactions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;46 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 46<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $781.22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$4,718.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$7,456.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$7,456.00<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br /><br />
