				Firstly - Great of you to ask before making a mistake and regretting it later.&nbsp; I won&#039;t rant about if you searched you could probably have found the answers.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather just give my opinions and info:<br /><br />vendors PGP key - find a program called gpg4usb, this will allow you to first import the vendors PGP key into it.&nbsp; Create your own PGP key, and then you can use this to encrypt your address for the vendor, so only he can read it.&nbsp; This is an extra level of security FOR YOU and essentially ensures no one, including SR staff can see your address except the vendor.<br /><br />how i will receive or track package - depends on the vendor.&nbsp; We shipped tracked mail but don&#039;t provide the numbers unless there is an issue.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to be home and generally don&#039;t have to sign.&nbsp; I would suggest if you have the tracking number at all...don&#039;t use it.&nbsp; This could someday prove you knew about the package if it was intercepted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will i have to be home to receive? - no<br /><br />Will i have to sign? - generally no, but i don&#039;t think its an issue to do so.&nbsp; Opinions will vary on this.<br /><br />Do i need id? - no, unless you are signing at the post office because a delivery notice was left.&nbsp; This is why its important (my opinion) to use your real name and address.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can i order to vacant friends house? He owns the house but hasn&#039;t lived there in a while. - If you use his name, and he&#039;s willing to pick it up, I&#039;d say &quot;maybe.&quot;&nbsp; If the delivery was being watched which is very unlikely, how would you explain being at the mailbox...if its him he could just be checking his mail and found this unexpected package...<br /><br />Can i order to my own home? I personally think this is best method. Blend in, rather than leaves things standing out from regular mail, like weird names, fake addresses, addressed to people that don&#039;t live here etc.<br /><br />As I said, these are my opinions, others may differ.
