				It always takes some time.. I&#039;ve heard of people having to wait as long as 24 hours to get their bitcoin deposited. Maybe you should look at the wiki to see what they&#039;re saying about that.

				Oh well at least I did it right, right?&nbsp; So the address SR gave me is what I used when I requested the withdraw of bitcoins from bitfloor....but when I went on SR and tried to withdraw using the SR address it said insufficient funds....and thats beacuse it takes awhile????&nbsp; Good to know...i&#039;m starting to think its easier to obtain things by other avenues!&nbsp; If only I was more techno savy this whole thing has taken me hours to do!

				Well to get your bitcoins from bitfloor to SR, you withdraw them using your address. But withdrawing on SR with your own address is sending coins to yourself! Withdrawing to an address is sending money to that address, so no need to withdraw from your SR account! :) And bitfloor is the most cost effective way to do it IMO, especially when doing a limit order...

				When I send my BTC to SR I go to Blockchain afterwards. I keep an eye on the transaction. After 6 confirmations my BTC shows up within 30 minutes on SR.

				As per my understanding, you can&#039;t &quot;withdraw&quot; bitcoins like you can a bank account. You can only send bitcoins from an address under your control to another address you specify. So that means you need to go to your non-SR wallet to send the bitcoins to your SR address (which you should update each time you send bitcoins). It takes a while (~8 hours), but that&#039;s just due to the need to get confirmations and I think SR also does some wallet tumbling to cover your tracks.
