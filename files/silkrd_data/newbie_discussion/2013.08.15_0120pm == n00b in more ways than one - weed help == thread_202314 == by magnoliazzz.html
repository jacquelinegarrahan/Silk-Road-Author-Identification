				I&#039;m in my late 30&#039;s. I&#039;ve been experiencing pretty persistent pain. It&#039;s not debilitating, but it is annoying and stressful. I&#039;ve found myself drinking more and sleeping more poorly. Nothing alarming with the drinking - a couple of drinks a few times a week - but it&#039;s different for me. I&#039;ve been smoking cigarettes more frequently, again because I&#039;m feeling stressed by the pain. I&#039;m seeing doctors but they don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on... <br /><br />Anyway, it got me thinking about using a little weed to help with the anxiety. It&#039;s better than drinking at night and it&#039;s definitely better than smoking tobacco. BUT, I&#039;ve never smoked before (unless you count that one time down in Jamaica over 10 years ago). I don&#039;t even know where to begin. I&#039;ve got kids and live in a family neighborhood so smell needs to be minimized. I have no friends who smoke so I can&#039;t even ask them for guidance.<br /><br />Any pointers for a n00b? I&#039;m talking from the type of weed I should buy, to the vendors I should go with, to how to get BTC, to how to smoke it properly. Needless to say, I have no clue what I&#039;m doing.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.

				Something with high CBD for pain would be good. Read up on the various strains on strain guide websites and then search for vendors carrying those strains.<br /><br />I believe the marijuana category now has sub-categories including high CBD!

				Starting with the type of weed you&#039;re looking for, there are two main catagories: Indica and Sativa (&amp; many hybrids of the two).&nbsp; For pain, you probably want and Indica which is generally described as a &quot;body&quot; high whereas Sativa is more generally described as a &quot;head&quot; high.&nbsp; Good hybrids hit you with both.&nbsp; Asking a vendor which catagory their product fits in is a good way to know what you&#039;re getting, or look for anything Kush, as Kushes are mostly Indica and best for your pain management.<br /><br />For a n00b, I&#039;d recommend (Clearnet Warning) leafly.com/explore.&nbsp; This site has a large variety of marijuana strands and aggregates the reviews of multiple users to describe the effects.&nbsp; You can even look for strands based on certain effects such as pain management and causing sleepiness.&nbsp; <br /><br />Never ordered bud from SR, so I can&#039;t offer you any vendor advice.&nbsp; There are many ways to get BTC.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest doing a search on how to get one &amp; you can decide which method you&#039;d like to go with.&nbsp; Some are more anonymous than others.&nbsp; <br /><br />To minimize the smell, edibles would be your best bet.&nbsp; It&#039;s not the easiest to make your own, but there is a plethora of information out there on how to make cannabutter that you can then replace regular butter in any recipe.&nbsp; Other options I met recommend is a going to your local headshop and looking into a vaporizor.&nbsp; It leaves a smell that is commonly described as burnt popcorn, far from weed smell.&nbsp; A vape also maximizes the THC you get from the bud.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good economical method.<br /><br />Also in addition to using SR, you can always pull a hey mister.&nbsp; (look for stoner looking chaps who buy blunts or cigarillos at the gas station yo!&nbsp; Done it, works!!)

				I can&#039;t really advise about who you should buy from or how to get BTC, but I can tell you about how to use weed.<br /><br />&nbsp;Firstly you should get a bong and a herb grinder. In my country they are available at adult stores, but you can also get them on SR. I recommend a double-chambered bong. It filters and cools the smoke better. <br /><br />Start by filling the chambers of the bong about half to two-thirds full with fresh, cold water. Doing this will give you much nicer smoke and avoid the harsh throat hit.<br /><br />&nbsp;Next, grind up some weed with an equal amount of tobacco. It doesn&#039;t need to be perfect, just roughly equal parts. You can use cigarettes or rolling tobacco, whichever brand/strength you prefer. <br /><br />A dose of pot smoked through a bong is called a cone, because of the thimble-like gadget that you pack the drugs into. Pack the cone, get a lighter, ignite it, and hold it at a downward angle towards the cone. If your bong has a small hole in the neck, cover it with your thumb. Inhale. Keep the lighter ignited. You&#039;ll probably cough the first few times, but soon you&#039;ll get the hang of it.<br /><br />As you inhale, the drugs with burn up. You&#039;ll see the smoke bubbling through the water. When the cone is empty, release your thumb from the hole on the neck of the bong. This will make you inhale the remaining smoke. Hold it in your lungs for a few seconds and then exhale.<br /><br />I recommend just starting with one cone at a time, as more than that is likely to make you nauseous the first few times (it did for me).<br /><br />Occasionally you will need to clean the bong, particularly as the cone and stem get gummed up with resin and shit. <br /><br />Hope this helps. :)

				If you live in Europe or the UK I would suggest bitbargain.co.uk.Lots of sellers , ESCROW and variety of paying methods.I am not a big fan of using weed for pain relief all by itself...If you suffer from myoscelletal pain then a combination of an anti-inflamatory drug and muscle relaxant will work far better than weed alone.Although there are excellent strains of medical marijuana out there it doesnt work the same way to every patient.This is fact.Its more trail and error or what works for you if you like.A good dealer will guide you through the -very enjoyable- selection process.Sleep is again the same try a few strains and find out what works for you.I would be very careful when combine weed and alcohol.<br />Hope I ve helped...Be safe&nbsp;

				You can also get nicer big ones. The thing is weed is easy to smoke so while you may use your vaporizer for something else unless the contents need to be liquid I bet you can smoke weed out of it.

				-Buy indica<br />-Check out Localbitcoins.com and use their escrow service for a face to face transaction(puts money in a side account for safety)<br />-There are tons of good weed vendors:<br />*Thurgood Jenkins<br />*AdaParcel<br />*OGBryan<br />*Farmer1<br />*XXXotica<br />*Tweetb<br />*LexiSadie<br />*MariosGramShoppe<br />*Rook<br />The list goes on... You can just set your options to only see domestic vendors, go to cannabis section, then weed subsection and check them all out.<br />-Vaporizer is probably your best option, unless you don&#039;t mind smelling like weed<br />-Make sure to learn pgp!<br />

				For actual pain I would recommend EATING cannabis instead of smoking it. Eating it lasts much longer, and seems to affect the entire body. Smoking is great for a headrush but it&#039;s relatively short-lasting.<br /><br />It actually takes some effort to get cannabis into an edible state. There is an &quot;edibles&quot; section under Cannabis.

				Id agree with the last post, cook with it. Get yourself a cook book or find some tutorials online, its pretty simple. Make a good oil or butter which you can then use in normal cooking just substitute any normal oil/butter with hash/weed oil/butter. Much easier to control the dose when you make it and its really tasty what you can knock up. Just remember its much stronger eating it than smoking it. If that fails a vapouriser is a good option.

				So I made my first BTC purchase today through localbitcoins.com. It went smoothly. I transferred the money to my blockchain wallet and now I&#039;m waiting to have it hit my account on SR. How long does that usually take? It&#039;s been about an hour.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been researching various strains on leafly for my needs. Seems like Skywalker OG is a good bet, as is blue dream. I will probably pick up a vaporizer locally. <br /><br />If I were to smoke it, how would I get it ready to use in the vape?

				PGP: Use this for your address and any sensitive messages that might reveal what type of transaction in happening. &quot;When will my item ship?&quot; Is probably safe unecrypted. I recommend not dealing with vendors who do not use PGP.<br /><br />Weed: My general favs are hybrids. In general sativas are more uppity and indicas are couchy. <br /><br />BTC: Bitinstant wasn&#039;t too bad when it is working but I much prefer localbitcoin (face to face) now. Bitcoin trades are not illegal but I would still recommend staying anonymous.
