				I already posted this in Tech support, but I figured I might as well post it here as well (and work on getting my posts up at the same time).<br /><br />I registered with the site last week and had no issue surfing around. Unfortunately I mistyped my password somewhere along the line and now that the new login page is up I&#039;m unable to reset my password (even though I know my PIN). Any thoughts or suggestions?<br /><br />I&#039;ve finally got some coin in my wallet and was hopping to jump right in...

				Found this in another thread ; <br />This is what it says<br /><br />Q. How do I log into the main SR site if I forgot my password?<br /><br />A. Make a new account, and PM Silk Road Explaining what happened (Forgot password/phished) and share info only the real account owner would know, such as last deposit address used, last three orders, BTC balance, etc. <br /><br />

				Oh it&#039;s nice that there&#039;s actually a way to recover your account if your password gets changed or if you ever lose it. Didn&#039;t know that.

				Are you sure? I just created a vendor account today.<br /><br />I&#039;m confident you could register a new account.<br /><br />If not - my apologies.

				The account registration is working just fine. <br /><br />I do have issues from time to time with the captcha because &#039;l&#039; looks like &#039;1&#039; and stuff. Commonly takes me 2-3 logon attempts to actually get in.

				Hi all, thanks a lot for your replies! Unfortunately when I click the link that says &quot;Click here to join&quot; i get this message under the log-in box on the next screen: &quot;New registrations are temporarily disabled. Please try again later.&quot; I&#039;ve just checked it again, and for some reason am having the same issue... Ideas?

				Hey NickNack, thanks for your reply. I feel like an idiot, but you were right, I was still using the old address which was causing the issue. Thanks for your help!
