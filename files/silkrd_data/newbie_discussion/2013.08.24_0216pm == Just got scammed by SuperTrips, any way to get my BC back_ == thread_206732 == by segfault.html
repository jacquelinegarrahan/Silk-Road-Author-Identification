				Nope, i only take mdma every weekend, and i usually take 150-200mg in each dosage. just to make 100% sure it was fake, i swallowed a whole gram at the club (thats after i dropped around 6 0.2 bags).. <br /><br />The weird thing is, it have the same strong taste as mdma, so it is very well made fake..<br /><br />And now, SuperTrips is no longer in SR so i cant send him any mail about this...<br /><br />

				If you finalized, the transaction is complete and there is nothing more that can be done besides leaving appropriate feedback (if possible) and letting others know via this forum. <br /><br />

				It sucks getting scammed. Watch out for fake addys. They are light pink instead of orange and contain non of the real ingredients. Sold by PepperidgeFarm and The Cali Connection for sure that I know of.

				That sucks man I&#039;m sorry to hear it!&nbsp; There has got to be some way to still contact the seller, from the sound of it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve (fortunately) never had to do it but isn&#039;t there some way to file a dispute with regard to a matter such as this?

				Main reason why I&#039;d only purchase cannabis via SR. Too easy to scam people with lookalike powders for MDMA, MBOME etc.

				Hard to believe but he just took me for $3000 on his 500 red question mark MDMA listing. Stings like a mofo.<br /><br />It&#039;s like every god damn vendor has to go out with a bang. Everyone runs out of product eventually, and they all want that one last big hit.
