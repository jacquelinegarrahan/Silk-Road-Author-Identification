				yr kush looks hella legit bryan, nice to see someone who really has a passion for growing a certain strain and doing it well as opposed to just growing every new hybrid shit that come out..&nbsp; i will prolly scoop up an osbourne from u some time soon, og kush truly is the perfect smoke when its done right..

				Just a thought: you may want to keep this thread for your advertising here and for people to leave reviews .... save the spam-to-50 for a different thread.&nbsp; That way, your advertisement thread looks more professional.&nbsp;

				I cant say enough about OGBryan! He went above and beyond to help me out with my purchase and I am very satisfied with my order. I went with 1oz of his untrimmed banana og kush. Was overweight on delivery and I got about 23g worth of good buds after trimming. Small buds of course, but great smoke for a budget smoker. 5/5 all around, I will be back before the weeks out if it lasts :)

				Heyup!<br /><br />I like your listings ogbryan.<br /><br />I have a question about your stains, where are they on the sativa / indica spectrum?

				They grow long and stretchy like a so called &quot;sativa&quot; would.&nbsp; That I can tell you as a fact as I grow it.&nbsp; There are different theories as to which strains were bred to make OG kush, the reality is that no one knows so I won&#039;t bullshit you with an answer. <br /><br />However OG kush I personally believe is in a class of it&#039;s own when it comes to smoke.&nbsp; Once you learn the smell and smoke of OG kush, no one can ever pass a fake off to you ever again.&nbsp; I hope you try it! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This 50 post rule is bullshit but ogbryan&#039;s weed definitely isn&#039;t.&nbsp; This shit is excellent in all respects: great bag appeal, frosty as hell, smooth hit, great taste, strong head high for a good 3 hours or so after half of a small joint.&nbsp; Vendor was nice enough to accommodate a special request for me and my package arrived cross-country in just two days.&nbsp; Out of my 25 purchases on SR I&#039;d say this is definitely in my top two along with JackBlue&#039;s Blue Dream. Immaculate product here.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a pic of some UNTRIMMED Banana OG...absolutely covered in frost. Not the best pic but you get the idea.<br />http://wuakd3inzzy5iz4w.onion/images/fafe93965d32bf65553c6dcd061e1ded.jpg<br />
