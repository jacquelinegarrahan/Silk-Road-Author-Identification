				The proper way would likely be to use a coin washing service, or deposit and withdraw from somewhere that the coins going in and out aren&#039;t the same.&nbsp; You&#039;re adding transaction fees unfortunately every time you do.

				Bitcoins are really neither anonymous nor open.&nbsp; The nature of the blockchain means you can trace them.&nbsp; Who did what through where with those coins? That&#039;s the anonymous part.<br /><br />Generally you only hold the coin&#039;s encryption key for a short time, and there could be a million other transactions associated with it.&nbsp; So which one is you buying something on SR?&nbsp; It is traceable, but the consequences are fairly negligible.&nbsp; <br /><br />Going through third parties, coin washing, private wallets etc. is best practice.&nbsp; If you were moving larger amounts of coins it turns into an essential.

				I don&#039;t think private wallet is the right term.&nbsp; You want it going through a third party besides your exchange and SR, so yes blockchain would be a good bet.<br /><br />I use electrum on a linux thumb drive that is encrypted and used for all my SR related things.&nbsp; There is a fair bit in the security forum if you&#039;re interested.

				My advice is to pretend you aren&#039;t going to buy anything off of SR.&nbsp; Go read up on bitcoin for a couple minutes, read their forums, and see what&#039;s what.&nbsp; Sending bitcoins to SR is an afterthought as long as you understand how bitcoin works, and what the various companies are.&nbsp; <br /><br />Way beyond the scope of this thread, and it is already all there laid out cleanly in the security forum.&nbsp; Just because you can&#039;t post doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t read it voraciously to protect yourself.

				It isn&#039;t like it has to be perfection at the level we are at here.&nbsp; Law enforcement is looking for easy arrests, and large amounts.&nbsp; As long as you do more than the minimum you should be ok in theory.&nbsp; Take some simple precautions, and don&#039;t sweat the small stuff to the point you have to order some xanax along with the rest of your order.

				The more you read on the topic of bitcoin anonymity/the correct system/the right way - the more confusing it gets. As I&#039;ve noticed on the forums, everyone has their own way to do everything. Read and take in everything that everyone posts and you&#039;ll get a good feel for it! Good luck. Be safe!
