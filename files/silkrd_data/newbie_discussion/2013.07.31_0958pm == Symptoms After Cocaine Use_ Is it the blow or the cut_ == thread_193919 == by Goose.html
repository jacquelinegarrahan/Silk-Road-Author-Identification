				Hi, all.&nbsp; I just have a couple of questions for all you Cocaine professionals out there.&nbsp; There are a number of bad symptoms that I get when using cocaine that vary from seller to seller and batch to batch.&nbsp; I am going to go over them all and see if anyone else out there has had similar experiences.&nbsp; I also am curious to find out if these symptoms are from the cocaine itself or possible from some kind of cut?<br /><br />Stomach issues: It seems like this happens every time I do blow regardless of the seller.&nbsp; When I wake up the morning after I have a bad stomach ache and I have the shits.&nbsp; This will happen days after use.&nbsp; <br /><br />Headaches: This is an issue that comes seller to seller.&nbsp; When I first hit a line there&#039;s no issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;About a half hour later I begin to get a headache.&nbsp; I am migraine prone so Im not sure if that is the reason or if it is from some sort of cut.<br /><br />Chest Tightness/Increased Heart Rate: Whenever I blow I get a tight chest depending on how much I do but the increased heart rate is on a seller to seller basis.&nbsp; <br /><br />Slight Back Pain: This one is weird.&nbsp; I have never heard of Cocaine giving anyone back pain.&nbsp; Every time I use C I get a very slight pain/soreness in my lower back. WTF?<br /><br />If anyone can offer an explanation for these symptoms I would love the help. Thanks!<br /><br />Much Love,<br />Goose

				Shits = Baby Lax Cut<br />Burn = Vitamin Cut or Bad Cook<br />Chest Tightness / pain = Heart racing coke side effects<br />Pain in lower back = ie. kidney or liver pain = bad cut

				It&#039;s the cocaine use...hate to break it to you, but you can&#039;t do coke without damaging your nasal passageway. <br /><br />Speed up the damage? Absolutely. But avoid it by having magical coke that doesn&#039;t destroy your septum? <br /><br />Not possible. Ask Freud.

				I&#039;m not a coke professional though...just a guy with serious doubts about inhaling HCL salts being something that can in any way be an activity that doesn&#039;t damage your nose. <br /><br />It&#039;s all bad for you - it&#039;s up to you to decide if you want to be Owen Wilson or (whatever your nose looks like now).
