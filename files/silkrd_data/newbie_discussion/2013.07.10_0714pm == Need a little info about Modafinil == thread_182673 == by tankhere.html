				Hey guys,<br /><br />my first order of Armodafinil 150mg is going to arrive soon, hopefully.<br /><br />I read about the effects, but I&#039;d like to hear some personal experiences.<br /><br />How long does it last? Is it noticeable on you, like being too active, with unnatural hand movements, or huge eyes? Or you simply feel focused and smart and stuff...<br /><br />What&#039;s the wear-off like?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				I just fly on that stuff, speed-rappin, joking along.&nbsp; Much better than Ritalin, not quite as good as Dexedrine.&nbsp; The euphoria for me lasts 4 hours or so, but it takes 16 hours or more before I can sleep.&nbsp; Mixes fine with alcohol, although you will be drunker than you think you are, so don&#039;t try to drive if you&#039;ve been drinking, no matter how alert you feel ldo.&nbsp; <br /><br />Recreational dose for me is 200mg, usually with a booster four hours later.&nbsp; It has effects at 50-100mg but I&#039;m still a little crazy even at those low doses.&nbsp; I&#039;ll take it to stay alert for tasks that require such a thing but it will definitely affect the way you are perceived by others.&nbsp; You will come across at least hypomanic, and possibly a little aggressive at times.&nbsp; Take this into account and make sure your heart is filled with love before you drop.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do NOT mix this with psychedelics, it will turn a beautiful mushroom trip into a sweaty, nauseous pain in the ass.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love this stuff.&nbsp; It&#039;s in my top ten, easily.&nbsp; Right up there with nicotine and caffeine.&nbsp;

				I tried it after reading about how it&#039;s neuroprotective and makes you feel refreshed. I was a bit disappointed as it made me feel a bit like on a low dose of dextroamphetamine. I was looking for a cleaner feeling, something that would make me awake but still being &quot;myself&quot;. I&#039;ll try to get that feeling with a lower dose (my first one was 200mg).

				I&#039;m actually thinking of switching to that too it&#039;s a tough call though. Some nice speed pills on SR and they cost $3-6 per pill and are way more stronger than any dose of Modafinil but I really need to stop using those after fucking up my nose from snorting that shit and gonna switch to Mod instead. It&#039;s the same price but w/e plus from what I hear it&#039;s alot better for getting stuff done like studying, homework, or a long day at work. The thing that bothers me about Meth or Adderall even is that you really have to stay focused on what you&#039;re doing. So many times I&#039;ll get distracted from what I&#039;m supposed to do and three hours later I&#039;m like wtf? lol... sorry a bit off topic but yes Mods are pretty safe compared to other stims.

				<br />I take 300mg of Modafinil everyday. I have a script for it. It does not do much for me though. I take it to counter all of the Narcotics and muscle relaxers and nerve meds. Without it I just sleep all day and night.<br /><br />It can also help with weight loss too.

				I have a bunch of samples from a friend. They are really awesome for when I need to get shit done in a professional environment. Usually half a pill (75mg) will keep me awake and productive for at least 8 hours. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried recreational doses yet. I&#039;m not sure if I would like them as a full 150mg dose definitely lets your body know you are a bit wired. The lack/low euphoria means I only use them when I need them.

				I recently ordered some Mod from a clearnet site, and can&#039;t wait for it to get here.<br />I don&#039;t believe I will take it all the time, but I certainly have times that I could use it.
