				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m new on deep web and SR, but I am a experienced drug consumer, and I love especially the psychedelics (mushrooms, LSD). Also, I grow indoor weed.<br /><br />I&#039;m french and I live in south of France in a dynamic city. My english is not fine, I hope you understand me and that I will progress.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for pure LSD and MDMA at a good price. I have read the Avengers LSD vendors review and select few sellers.<br /><br />Maybe that I will find opportunity here, in any case I&#039;m glad to have found you and this incredible list of various drugs !<br /><br />After this brief presentation I have some questions :<br />I have read several times in words like &quot;seller requires FE&quot; and I don&#039;t understand what &quot;FE&quot; means ?<br />The bitcoin transaction system is efficient isn&#039;t it ? So why few sellers are not affordable by fresh buyers ? And how a new buyer does for become trustfull ?<br /><br />Thanks for the help.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Kamp<br />

				bonjour! FE = finalise early. this means you pay the seller before they send your order. it is not recommended. try to find a vendor who does not require this. you become trusted by completing more orders, releasing your payment as soon as the order arrives and ideally having 0% refund rate. these are the things that are shown in your buyer stats when you make an order. <br />the reason many vendors ask for FE is because often new buyers forget to come back and release the payment or try to scam vendors by saying the order never arrived when it did.

				Ok, it&#039;s much clear now. Thank you, Ron Swanson !<br />However with greats vendors maybe I can accept FE. I had think to this, but I didn&#039;t know it&#039;s called like that. I think that a big dealer has no interest in scam. Because a satisfy customer is a customer for life ;)<br /><br />Merci pour l&#039;accueil, Andrewbud420 ! ;)<br /><br />++<br />Kamp<br />

				A lot of new buyers will have to Finalize early depending on the vendor until they have some stats..... <br /><br />

				it is your decision but make sure to search the vendor here on the forums before you order. some vendors have been accused of scamming newbies because the vendors will have more credibility. also i would stick to ordering within the EU or france if possible so there is less worry about customs.
