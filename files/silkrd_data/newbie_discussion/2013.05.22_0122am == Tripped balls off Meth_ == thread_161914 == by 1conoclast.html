				Over the weekend I did some Crystal I completely wigged out.&nbsp; I thought people were breaking in and hiding in my vents.&nbsp; I was living in a false reality with made up people with ultra vivid auditory, visual, and smell halluciniations.&nbsp; You couldn&#039;t convince me that what I was experiencing wasn&#039;t really happening.&nbsp; Can good Meth cause this or did I get some cut shit?

				Meth isn&#039;t known to affect serotonin, but this doesn&#039;t sound psychedelic in the first place.<br /><br />This is most likely a product of meth&#039;s neurotoxicity in your brain.

				That&#039;s what we call &quot;getting twisted.&quot;&nbsp; You might want to take notice of how much dope taken and/or how many days awake you&#039;ve been when you start to mind frame and mood change to a more anxious paranoid place.<br />You want to actively make efforts to avoid a full blown freak out.&nbsp; It&#039;s never fun for any friends who&#039;ll have to deal with you throughout the entire ordeal.&nbsp; And it can lead to really dumb mistakes being made in the wake of your delusional panic.&nbsp; Like when you run down the street at 3 am stark naked screaming about the people living in your air condition vents.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; Just always avoid getting to that point.&nbsp;

				I was sniffing it. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m never doing that again.&nbsp; It is definitely too hard to regulate. I had the cops come out twice, told my upstairs neighbor to grab a knife and come down, freaked everybody out.&nbsp; No thanks.

				The paranoia can be pretty extreme. I remember while sitting in the park a car about 100m away randomly stopped outside a house. I had a direct view and noticed no one got out of the car. After a few minutes I got extremely paranoid wondering why the fuck no one got out. Thought people were after me and that was a spy or some shit. I freaked out for about 30 minutes watching the car until the guy got out and went inside the house. <br /><br />It&#039;s amazing some of the shit you think while high.
