				Hey guys. I&#039;ve been surfing SR for awhile now and am now just finding the time to actually go ahead and participate. Sorry in advance if this question is answered somewhere; but, what is the easiest way to get bitcoins to SR? Bitinstant doesn&#039;t do the direct address anymore and I haven&#039;t been able to find a definitive answer anywhere. If you guys could share the methods you think are best that would be most appreciated. Thanks in advance.<br />-jcrampton

				I believe everyone has their own way of dealing with bitcoins.<br />I trade â‚¬ for BTC on one of the bitcoin exchanges, then send the BTC to my private wallet on my own computer. This is like another bank account to me- i view it as a private savings account.<br />When I want to spin off some to SR, i send them through a shared wallet or a tumbler service, so the trace of the coins is lost.

				What was the price difference between blue sky and mtgox?&nbsp; I have tried several times checking blue sky onion site but haven&#039;t caught them while they were still open to see what they had been trading for that day.

				I would say either Blue Sky Traders or Coinbase.<br />With Blue Sky it goes directly to the wallet address you supply, SR or other. Coinbase involves actually purchasing the coins then sending them to SR. There is also Dwolla, but that takes a week or so.

				I would stay away from mtgox, they want to much personal info.&nbsp; I hear bitstamp is easier to use and requires no personal info.&nbsp; Also you can use them with bitinstant and the fee&#039;s are minimal
