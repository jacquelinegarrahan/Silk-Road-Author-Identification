				Thank you jkfire! I have been, and will continue to read through the forums. I&#039;m in no hurry, just want to go about purchasing the right way and don&#039;t want to get ripped off, busted, etc. I have also looked at quite a few vendor profiles. I&#039;m a little confused because everyone says not to FE, but there are vendors with really good reviews who demand it and then also say if you don&#039;t give them 5/5 rating they won&#039;t deal with you. also some vendors won&#039;t deal you until you have dealt with others first, which Makes sense I guess. I appreciate the feedback. cheers!

				Alot of vendors ask for (require) FE because they have been burned by scammers in the past.&nbsp; If you do decide to go with a vendor that requires FE i would suggest making a couple smaller orders first.&nbsp; That way you can gain a little of the vendors trust and any good vendor will allow you to stay in escrow for larger purchases in the future.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldnt worry about the required 5/5 either.&nbsp; If a vendor does something that would warrant a rating of lower than 5/5, chances are you wont want to do business with them in the future anyways.

				I see what you mean about the 5/5, but it seems like even if you were unhappy in the slightest you couldn&#039;t knock their rating down even 1 point or you lose their services. Kinda makes the rating system pointless. Thanks for your feedback heavysmoker!
