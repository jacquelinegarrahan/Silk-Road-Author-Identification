				Hi folks.<br />I made the stupid error of changing my pin while on blues, and forgot how the path to making sense of my pin worked. I made my five attempts and got locked out for three days. Yeah it was stupid, and I had to work hard to be able to get an order going, but all&#039;s well that ends well.<br /><br />My question is this folks, does anyone know if there&#039;s a way I can take the stats from the new account I created and put them with the original?<br /><br />This might not seem that important, but I&#039;m around the magic ten figure and don&#039;t want to take any steps backward.<br /><br />I realise this is hardly a newb question, maybe some of the (exceedingly attractive and bright) experienced SRers could give me a nudge in the right direction before I go pestering the mods?<br /><br />Thanks people!
