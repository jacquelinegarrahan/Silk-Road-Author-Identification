				Short answer: No<br /><br />This was answered in another thread. With all the proxy servers and backup addresses I find it very unlikely that will ever happen. It might get shut down for a few hours, but it&#039;ll be right back up ready to rock and roll 8) I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much, buddy.

				The great thing about SR and its decentralization is that you can only really target one person at a time and no one is connected with SR. It would take too long and far too many resources to take down all of SR. You can take one vendor out every once in a while. (SDM.. I feel he kinda got sloppy by accepting cash for btc in mail) but not the consumer and not even close to the whole pie.

				Although it is unlikely Silk Road will be stopped so early, it should be noted that, as we learn new things every day to stay hidden, so do police learn new tricks every day to find us . Complacency is the enemy of security. Act each day as if you expect a knock at the door. Stay smart, stay safe and plan ahead.

				Not sure if it would actually be enacted if the site was shut down, but you may not have noticed you can nominate in account settings a &quot;Backup bitcoin address&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;help tab says: &quot;if for some reason this site has to be shut down unexpectedly, the available bitcoins in your account will be sent here. &quot;<br />Somehow, I don&#039;t think they would be, but it can&#039;t hurt to put my address in there.&nbsp; When I get them I&#039;ll forward them onto you.<br /><br />&nbsp;???<br /><br />

				Essentially yes, they could arrest the people behind SR and cut the head off of the whole thing. Something else will always pop up though, but the odds of getting shut down are slim to none.

				I don&#039;t think SR will get shutdown any time soon. It&#039;s just not within an authority&#039;s power to do that.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always kind of thought that if drugs were legal, then dealers as we know them would be out of a job :P

				Presumably one day DPR will pull the biggest heist in bitcoin history, shutdown the site and run off with all the funds. However right now SilkRoad is a huge cash cow - why kill it off just yet?<br /><br />[Even if DPR would never do this, a rational user of the site *must* assume he will because economically it makes sense for him to do so - but only when he wants to retire or if the site stops making money].<br /><br />The good news for users is that it&#039;s very easy to setup an alternative site. So if/when SR gets shut down, other alternatives will spring up to take its place.
