				Made my first purchase. Starting small, 1G MDMA from USA2USA.&nbsp; I bought on Monday with excitement hoping to watch the whole process take place.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well here we are on Thursday and and the order is still processing, no reply on a PM I sent and I have this feeling of disappointment.&nbsp; Of course I&#039;m still reading through the forums and checking out other listings and I have this feel of &#039;Maybe I should have went with this vendor or why didn&#039;t I see this posting&#039; etc with a grass is always greener feel.&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone else with me?

				Yeah, I was like that with my first purchase. It came through fine though. I didn&#039;t have any problems with communication or anything like that, so maybe you should msg a few people before you buy in future, check that they&#039;re an attentive seller....

				Did you check the vendor&#039;s rating first?&nbsp; And search the forum for feedback on that vendor?&nbsp; If people seem content with the vendor, I&#039;d just wait it out, you&#039;ll probably get it eventually.&nbsp; Just be patient ;)

				If they are a really small vendor I would not expect them to ship every day.&nbsp; But I dont know anything about this particular situation.&nbsp; I just wanted to say that I went on SR and searched for that vendor out of curiosity.&nbsp; And the search engine replied:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">search for usa2usa produced 210 results</code><br />But none of those results had anything to do with the vendor.&nbsp; So how would anyone even find this vendor in the first place if they have no listings?&nbsp; And why is the search engine broken this way?

Which at current prices are worth more than when you made the purchase.

				ehhhhh i wouldn&#039;t worry about it, bc of the escrow system thats in place you don&#039;t really run any risk of losing your money but it sucks that it is tied up in a sale that seems to be going nowhere. Seems like the vendor is waiting to re-up to send out more orders... hang in their buddy, i haven&#039;t had a bad experience yet, but i do my research every time i press that place order button!

				Hey everyone.&nbsp; Thanks for the replies and the support.&nbsp; &nbsp;The full vendor name is usa2usadutchxtc; sorry for the abbreviation.&nbsp; I sent another message this morning so I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed.&nbsp; The cancel option isn&#039;t available for another 2 days.&nbsp; Having the order seem stalled is bad, but lack of information is worse.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about the expectations!&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep everyone posted.&nbsp; Thanks again.

				Just be patient :)<br />The first order always gives you the jitters. The low amount my have put you on a lower priority of getting shipped. <br />Make sure you have a Reagent test kit as well. That way you can be sure about the MDMA content. My last domestic MDMA order turned out to be Methylone! <br />
