				I wish I was able to post this in the shipping forum, but since my forum account is at newbie status it seems I must post here.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been sending parcels to my address with my name(not a good idea, I get that) and I&#039;ve had no problems for over a year.<br />However, I ordered from a VERY reputable vendor and it&#039;s been a month and a half and still no sign of it. It was international -- Canadian to the US.<br />But now, none of my orders are arriving(at least they&#039;re just a little slow in arriving, *other* than that international order).<br />I for the hell of it, ordered from greendaddy888 who had a vendor account at the time, with a 50-something approval rating. It was for five free xanax 1mg pills. I obviously considered a scam when it *never* arrived, but he recently contacted me saying he sent twice as much, in a very angry message after I told him I hadn&#039;t received it. He mentioned he had tracking and that it told him it was delivered, but no sign of the parcel. I just sent him a message asking for the tracking. <br /><br />The point is, I should&#039;ve received parcels(*should have*) and I ordered just yesterday a bunch more and I&#039;m HOPING that they&#039;ll arrive like they have before, from vendors I&#039;ve been ordering from frequently.<br /><br />I have gotten no notices of any seizures, but I&#039;m just seeing &quot;any&quot; mail with my name at the top, just for other members of my place. Is it possible that somehow I&#039;ve been put into a blacklist of somekind after ordering from pharmacypowder(100) and maybe they&#039;ve somehow caught on even though he has a 100% success rate to the U.S.? Is it possible that *all* the parcels I&#039;ve ordered under my name are now being collected and maybe I&#039;ll get setup for some controlled delivery by law enforcement? I have an account that I&#039;ve been active with for over a year, and I&#039;ve *never* had a problem like this. <br /><br />Could all my parcels that I&#039;ve ordered recently under my name are now being withheld from being sent to me? Or am I just overreacting? This guy who sold the free xanax said he had proof he sent it through tracking(he probably won&#039;t respond for a while so that&#039;s why I&#039;m posting this, I&#039;m freaking out here). Please, somebody, with any experience whatsoever, am I overreacting or is the USPS been instructed somehow to hold any and all parcels? I have gotten no seizure notices whatsoever.

				If it were only a small amount of Xanax, then you would most likely receive a love letter from customs. They seem to send out letters for Benzos.<br />I really doubt customs would flag your address and hold up all your orders over such a small amount of medication.<br /><br />Oh and if it was seized, the tracking would say it didn&#039;t leave customs. I have a strange feeling the vendor wont give you the tracking number.<br /><br /><br />But hey, you&#039;d be smarter to find a safe drop address that has no relation to you and use that from now on.

Not the xanax. I thought he was just a scam artist(and might still be), it was literally a free listing. Just had to pay shipping(which would go to him):<br /><br />This is a convo between me and the at-one-point vendor who had a free listing of 5 mg xanax pills:<br /><br />Him: &quot;i sent to u and have tracking man, why all this and you know you received it.shm&quot;&nbsp; (he never sent me any tracking number)<br /><br />Me: I haven&#039;t received anything as of yet. When I do, I&#039;ll finalize 5/5 and give you outstanding feedback.<br /><br />Him: i am not sending you anything, i have the tracking and you did receive and you won&#039;t again and i have new account, if i see this name purchase from me i will cancel so don&#039;t bother again,you got free pills and your money back so go away and stay away... all names that put in claims will get canceled.. scammers who wanna gain the world for free..don&#039;t even reply its not worth the typing.. enjoy ya free ride and i hope you get charged up on here the max price for any pill you buy because you could never buy from me.&quot;<br /><br />Me: You have the tracking? Can you please send me it? I&#039;m actually thinking that maybe my parcels are being seized, ALL of them. So PLEASE, show me the tracking! I need to know when and where it was delivered<br /><br /><br />So, am I being paranoid? He&#039;s pissed because I won&#039;t hit &quot;release payment&quot; so he gets his tracking money.
