				I don&#039;t know why but it bugs the shit out of me when I see someone posting garbage just to get their post count up to get out of the newbie section.<br /><br />Maybe it is integrity and thinking by writing actual posts instead of a bunch of nonsense vendors will see that come time my first purchase (which is taking forever with the whole btc + anonymity) and know that I am for real and not some idiot.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Try being a long time user on a new vendor account. It&#039;s difficult to maintain a professional presence while having to make so many posts just to access the relevant forums :(<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				Or a long time user (2+ years) with no previous posts on the forum, though with plenty of purchasing stats...<br /><br />Personally, I think the 50 post count is ridiculous anyways. What&#039;s the point - just to thin out the number of people able to post? I guess it makes some sense... But requiring me to spam nonsense so I can make useful posts is still stupid. Why not just base it on SR account age?

Unfortunately this also makes it more difficult for genuine new buyers and vendors.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

Every section of the forum had multiple threads with huge spam names, whilst the limit they&#039;ve implemented has reduced that significantly, it has also made things significantly more inconvenient for legitimate users. I can see the intention though, quite a few newbies did fall to phishing scams and such.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf
