				WTF...I just lost my account. I entered my password (COULD NOT have been wrong. I know this 150%) and it eventually took me to the screen where I have to enter my email to retrieve my password, and of course the email is fake. I assume I have lost that account because everytime I try to log in now it takes me to the email screen...WTF

				Sorry about your account loss. Were you at least able to get a name that is close to what you once had it?

				Have you visited any links to SR? It seems you may very well have been hacked. Another member fell for the atlantis phishing scam, made an account with the same credentials as those of their SR accounts. They where hacked and robbd, of coarse. I wish you the best. As ive been fucked by a key logger in the past, and having your coin stolen is a most sickening feeling. Best of luck dude.

				PS. If you message SR admins about this, with some provided information that only you would have, they will do a PW reset for you to get back into and secure your original account.

				Nah, it dont really matter too much to go to the admins. It was only about 130 posts or something...It wouldnt have been a phishing scam or anything like that...I dont know why it happened because I put the correct password in, no doubt about it...meh. It was the same name as my SR account but that prob is a bad thing. Oh well, fuck it...Spam to 50 again :/

No harm no foul, so to speak. Though, if your market place nym and PW are the same as those of the account youve been locked out of, you may want to change all that.
