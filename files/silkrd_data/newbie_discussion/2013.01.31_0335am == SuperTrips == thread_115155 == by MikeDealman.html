				He didn&#039;t rip people off, he just got overwhelmed with orders and had a liquidity issue due to troubles converting BTC to cash. The only problem with ordering from him now is he is still massively popular, so takes longer to ship than most vendors.

If you want to keep your buyer&#039;s trust you don&#039;t disappear for months and not keep your buyers updated with your situation. Do you honestly want someone who is untrustworthy sending drugs to you? I would imagine supertrips probably also keeps the buyer information after they sell to people.

Never received anything, he went to vacation mode and then stealth mode. He was gone. I watched as his rating fell and stopped paying attention. Months went by and I noticed that his rating was on the rise so I took a look. New listings and positive feedback, so I sent a message explaining my experience. He sent me the BTC. The explanation I was given at that time was that he had been ripped off by&nbsp; BTC exchange. In summation, I trust SuperTrips.

				Generation Y, have you ever tried his red? ? Those things are amazing, and from what i saw not many vendors have his stuff.&nbsp; I used to get those from a friend last year and then my friend said no more.&nbsp; Ive been looking for them since, and now that i finally discover sr, this happens with SuperTrips, Im dying to place an order but I can afford to lose another couple hundred.<br />I know there are other pills on sr but most vendors dont ship to the US and if they do they offer no more than a 50% refund and if the items reshipped and that gets lost, your fucked.&nbsp; Im still trying to find someone..

				Hey,<br /><br />so I want to share you my experience with SuperTrips. I had 3 orders with him which all were successfull and I received my products within a maximum of 4 days. Was really satisfied with his services.<br /><br />Then I placed an order at the beginning of january when he had changed his policy to FE under 1000 $. <br /><br />Since I had made good experiences with him in the past, I FEd (for the first and for the last time!) and now after six weeks still no product has arrived. (for a domestic order...and domestic orders always come through and need 1 or 2 days in general)<br /><br />Messaged him about the situation and the communication is as slow as it can possibly get, really frustrating.<br /><br />As I requested a refund, he asked for my buyer stats which I sent him immediately. They are more than sufficient for a refund. After that he simply has not responded to me. <br /><br />So all in all I don&#039;t recommend ordering from SuperTrips. If you do so you also can play roulette with your money. I think my money is gone!<br /><br />If you are looking for a good german MDMA vendor, i would recommend Powerade to you...i alway had good experiences with this guy.<br />
