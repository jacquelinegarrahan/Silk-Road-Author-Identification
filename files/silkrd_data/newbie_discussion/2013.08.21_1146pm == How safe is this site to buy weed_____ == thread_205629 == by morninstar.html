				I am new to this site and I do love to smoke weed. I am looking for a new way to buy without having to call my local dealer all the time. So I did a little digging and found the Silk Road I want to have an easier way to buy but without all the drama that comes with it. So I want to know how safe this is I mean come on you know what they say if it&#039;s to good to be true something must be wrong. Please let me know it&#039;s okay I don&#039;t want to worry about getting ripped off by someone.

				Quick bullet list.<br /><br />1. find a vendor with good ratings.<br />2. Try to find a review on the forums.<br />3. Try not to cross borders.<br />4. Never FE.<br />5. Don&#039;t go skipping to the mailbox screaming &quot;My weed is here! My weed is here!&quot; when the post man is coming.<br />6. Don&#039;t brag to your buddies about where that good shit came from, just let it slap them in the brain.<br />7. If they want some offer to go halves or something when you get your next one.<br /><br />I just personally think that it is probably best that not too many people in a small area know about SR and how to get here, although it&#039;s on Google. You even have dicks on the paid Google ads offering to tell you how to get here for a fee, Those are probably not real.

				By your first sentence, we sound alike&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />The site itself is pretty safe, it&#039;s the shipping you really have to worry about. Always buy from vendors with good feedback, and never finalize early. <br /><br />As you&#039;d expect, domestic packages are a lot safer than international (no customs).<br /><br />Make sure to use PGP when ordering, you don&#039;t want to send your personal info unencrypted.<br /><br />Also, no fake names, ship this as you would any ebay package

				Some friends and I have been mailing herbs to each other for years. I am an eBay seller and what I do is go back to some of my old orders and print a new label with updated info. This way there is no in person trip to the post office, and it looks legit. I always use small flat rate boxes and since sealing the cracks with tape is a check on that list I seal a smaller box inside of the FRB. The post woman just picks it up with the rest of my eBay orders and never thinks any different.

				Look for vendors that use MBB packaging.<br /><br />Vendors that ship with the methods posted in the thread below get my business.<br />(It&#039;s the sticky from the shipping section titled :&quot;stealth that works-drop the PE grade vac seal&quot;)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119458.0

				Provided you follow the precautions listed in the other replies, this is far safer than buying from anyone you know. Guaranteed.
