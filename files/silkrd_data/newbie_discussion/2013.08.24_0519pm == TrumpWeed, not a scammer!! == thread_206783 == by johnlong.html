				Hi guys<br />New to the form but not new to the road. usually coming on here<br />to read posts and updates, never needed to post something.<br />Anyways to the topic.<br />I know there can be scammers out there, giving these amazing prices and you<br />cant help but click the order button and be dumb enough to FE, thats me ha....<br />So i gave Trumpweed a chance, his prices were amazing and so was the rate of replys, one every<br />30mins.<br />I also gave him a chance because he didnt want me to FE, so i knew my money was safe.<br />So i ordered and he shipped and gave me tracking all good.<br />Then a day later his account was removed.... so i was like something is up.<br />I messaged him and he said he had given free weed away for good reviews and for this<br />reason his account was removed. I admit, i was a little worried, but knew my coins were safe.<br />3 days later, i get this package, containning a half pound, with an extra 7grams. The bud was amazing<br />and looked amazing. I felt like the scammer for the price i got it at. I even ordered a cheaper weed and he said he <br />had something way stronger, and i said yes and boy am i glad. Stuffs nearly all gone out the door.<br />So im posting this because i want this guy back on the road. I know he made a mistake, but really<br />doesnt sound like a bad mistake, at least for the guy that got free weed, haha<br />So im posting this so people know, this guy is far from a scammer, he sounds like a nice guy,<br />trying to help people. I really would like to be able to order again off him on the road,<br />because his prices, and overall service matches or even surpass&quot;s some of the top vendors on the road..<br />......<br />Hope this post, lets people know what they are missing <br /><br />John<br />
