				So I&#039;ve been using GPG Tools/Keychain Access for the past couple weeks, just learned how to use PGP. I&#039;ve made two orders on SR that as far as I know were successful. I haven&#039;t received them yet but they&#039;re both In Transit. I did have trouble with one of them, the vendor asked me to send the message again because for some reason he couldn&#039;t open it, but the second time I sent it I&#039;m assuming it worked because he marked it In Transit.<br /><br />So now, over a week later, I&#039;m trying to encrypt a message and the recipient can&#039;t open it. I tried sending it twice to two different PGP Keys of theirs and they said it keeps popping up &#039;PGP Key Not Found&#039; or something to that extent. Tried it several times. Their key seems to be importing correctly, the name pops up in my Keychain just fine. I select the text, hit the command to encrypt and select and be sure to check off the recipient&#039;s name, but they still can&#039;t open it.<br /><br />Please help! I plan to put in a couple more orders today and I can&#039;t figure out what&#039;s wrong with my PGP! Anyone want to send me their key so they can see what&#039;s going on? Thanks.

				So you need to encrypt the message with their public key, is that what you are doing? I would remove any keys you have already and try importing their key again

Glad you got it all fixed up. PGP seems so complicated when you don&#039;t know what it is. Seeing all those &quot;BEGIN PGP KEY&quot; or &quot;START PGP BLOCK&quot; or whatever, it all seems intimidating or at least it did for me. When I actually got to using it and get the idea behind it, I see that it is ridiculously simple

You can&#039;t even decrypt your own message once you have encrypted it. The only key involved is their public key.
