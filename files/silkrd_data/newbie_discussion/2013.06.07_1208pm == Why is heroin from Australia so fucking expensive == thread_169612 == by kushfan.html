				Ywp supply and demand...drugs are&nbsp; difficult too import into australia, that&#039;s why they&#039;re not sold here IRL like they are in the states for example<br /><br />But some of the dope here that came from Ozexpress and comes from NodNow is very very potent and very good value as a result, a little goes a long way<br /><br />check em out if you&#039;re looking for very good domestic hammer, it&#039;s as good as ANYTHING on SR just a bit pricier, but well worth it, you wont be disapppointed coz it WILL BE the strongest smack you&#039;ve EVER had.<br /><br />&nbsp;if you do get some from these guys BE CAREFUL, START SMALL, it;s better 2 holes in your arm than one in the ground!<br />You were warned ... Please be careful when using heroin with any downers like benzos or alcohol, the chances of od&#039;ing increase greatly!<br /><br /><br />m m m motek x ;)

				@kushfan as a long time h user from the east coast of aus i kno a lil about the local market.<br />while its tru that being geographically isolated plays a part in the high prices i dont believe this is the cause of the inflated costs. because of our proximity to south east asian countries we are spoilt for quality and we seldom see the brown middle eastern alkaline heroin. when i started using in the early 90s the vietnamese/cambodian community almost had a complete monopoly on the east coast heroin trade. the quality was excellent and the prices were good. about aus $200 a gram but remember back then the USD-AUD conversion was 50% so USD $100 gram. on the street the typical &#039;cap&#039; was $30 and you could easy go 2 ways.<br />in the summer 99-2000, in the lead up to the olympics LE went ballistic securing entry ports and attempting to &#039;clean up&#039; the streets. in a 3 mth period Sydney went from having two 24hr open air heroin/cocaine markets and literally 100s of on call suppliers to a handful of dealers who themselves had lost their steady supply chains. prices doubled and quadrupled during this period. it took about 6-12 mths after the olympics had finished for new supply routes to be established and old ones re-established but the prices remained elevated. dealers now knew, thanx to LE, that users would pay top $$$ if they had to. fast forward 15-20yrs and AUD USD has reached parity and we pay 4-6 times the $$$ our US brethren pay for similar product. more often than not street quality is better here than in most european cities(i personally know that to be true of london and paris) and on par with what i know of US cities but a few rungs up the ladder and its of similar quality to most cities. i think the smarter aus suppliers realise they can make the same profit margins in aus as their international counterparts with less dilution of product so the quality at street level in aus is usually excellent(exceptions to every rule) but in turn we pay a premium. <br />SR could go a long way to correct this LE manufactured anomaly and i sincerely hope it does... and thats my essay on modern junky history

				hey hamahed welcome, and thanks for such a good synopsis of the events in the Oz heroin&nbsp; markets, I agree a lot, although I think the quality still fluctuates substantially, and for reasons I cant fathom. One thing I;ve noticed is a number of africans getting into the game, and so ar it seems like none of them use either and there dope is surprisingly good!<br /><br />I cant compare the dope like you have when travelling and used, which is most interesting to know. <br />How long ago were you in the US and UK?<br /><br />I&#039;ve traveled extensively through SE Asia sampling heroin evrywhere I went which included the Golden Triangle I&#039;ve also spent a lot os time in India where I cane to LOVE smoking good opium! mmm mmmmm great stuff if you like nodding off and having those crazy dreams that you only get from good opiates!<br /><br />Thanks again for a great start here on the forums matey with a cool informative post<br />&nbsp;+1 and keep it up, Members like you are valued here,&nbsp; <br /><br />I fing the overall quality of posts in this forum great, and I really appreciate those members who contribute.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never said this to anyone else, but hamahed mate, go to one of the &quot;spam to 50//&quot; threads and DO! Cox I reckon your input would be valued in the rest of the foums, I for one look forward to seeing you there! ;)<br /><br />cheers <br /><br />m m m motek x<br />

I was actually sent to england by my parents in the late 90s when my using was starting to impact on daily lyf and i was getting in to a bit of trouble with the old bill. i was still young enough to worry what my parents thought but old enough to wholeheartedly destroy myself. within 48 hrs of stepping of the plane i was at brixton scoring street deals. that was where i first saw that brown afghan shit and was horrified when the bloke that scored for me started putting citric acid powder in the spoon. it was many years until I saw it again in aus and then only a handful of times. years later a close mate and I spent 6 mths traveling and tho we didnt really look for anything other than weed and party drugs we were offered smack in paris and I was never one to decline the offer of a tickle. once again that brown.<br />one place I have always wanted to go for a heroin holiday was thailand or cambodia. I have heard mixed stories about availability but always good things about quality. theres also an excellent book I read a few years back called &#039;Shantaram&#039; written by an ausy user who fled a prison sentence in aus and went to india. got me interested in seeing that country. definitely give it a read if you get the chance.<br />Anyway all this reminiscing is making me want a shot. Apologies to kushfan for hijacking the thread. very bad manners for a newbie. thanx again for the encouraging words motek, I actually enjoyed writing that little spiel about ausy using thru my eyes. hope I can become a contributing part of the SR community
