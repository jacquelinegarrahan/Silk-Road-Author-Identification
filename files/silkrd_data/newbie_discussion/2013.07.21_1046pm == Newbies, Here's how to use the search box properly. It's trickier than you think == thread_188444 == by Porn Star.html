				If you&#039;re reading a thread and type something in the search box, it will only search that thread. If you want to search the whole forum, then go to the forum home page and do your search from there. <br />This one got me for a while here. I was searching for things and not finding answers. Now I&#039;m a search pro and you are too. SR ROCKS!!

				i&#039;ve found the search function to be pretty useless. also it&#039;s extremely annoying to have that message &#039;your last search was less than 5 seconds ago&#039;... when it wasn&#039;t! normally i would always use google to search forums but in case of sr forum it&#039;s not a possibility

				You get that notification a lot because you&#039;re using Tor. There aren&#039;t many exit nodes on Tor, so you&#039;re probably using the same one as a few other people who are using the forums. Pretty fucking annoying, but it can&#039;t be helped...
