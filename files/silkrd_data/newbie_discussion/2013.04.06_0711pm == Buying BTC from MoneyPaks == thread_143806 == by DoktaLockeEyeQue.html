				Hi,<br /><br />Obviously Common Sense goes a long way in any situation.&nbsp; However, in this situation, am I wrong to assume you must have some faith in the vendor as you may become &quot;scammed&quot; at any point?&nbsp; With all of the increase in sketchiness rampant over classical ways of obtaining BTC (eg BitUnInstant, YouZappedmyZip? ValleyGox) how would each of you personally go about it?<br /><br />Probably Beating a Dead Horse.&nbsp; And SugarMama is sweet... but tart as that fee is hefty-ier as you increase your deposit.<br /><br />Assume all variables: Packed City vs. &quot;WhereAmI&quot; towns; Frequency/Amt of Dep/Cash, Bank, MonopolyMoney, etc.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Buy the moneypak in the amount you want to exchange then list it on SR or other sites that take bitcoin as payment.&nbsp; Then you save on exchange fees.

				Better yet, go to the place you buy the moneypak and look around for other pre-paid cards like Vanilla Visa and list some of those too.&nbsp; Then you can see what sells best and will get your bitcoins to you the fastest.&nbsp;
