				I just wanted to comment again that i am new to this board, i did not have the luxury of paying 10-15-20 dollars for a BTC. when I got introduced to this board BTC were trading well over 100 dollars. I am poor and dont have much liquidity, tho I do have access to many sources of perscription drugs. I&#039;m just trying to be a productive meber of the silk road community. I believe the only reason these things are frowned upon is because people have bad experience with scammers. I have no intent to defraud someone just to get some BTC for my pills so I can trade for some other merchandise offered on the anonymous marketplace. I am glad to see that some very patriotic people stood up and made a decision to take a stance and use their talents to help ease the pain associated with drug transactions

				The forums aren&#039;t meant as a place for commerce. Silk Road proper, http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/, is.<br /><br />Please check the following pages for info on what the standard ways around here are:<br /><br />Buyers Guide - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide<br />Sellers Guide - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide<br />The Ordering Process - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=The_ordering_process<br /><br />Silk Road has systems in place that protect both parties in their endeavors to participate. Directly trading between individuals isn&#039;t safe, and generally won&#039;t happen.<br /><br />Generally speaking, if you don&#039;t have the money to get started selling, then it&#039;s probably not a good idea. You have to be able to handle the risk involved, when you begin selling you have obligations then to meet your sales. It is a business. At the same time, there is a great deal of power that comes with this type of involvement... you take great risk at both the buyer, and your own. The same goes on the other side, as a purchaser, you do so at a risk. Going around the systems that are there to try and reduce the risk as much as possible, only serves to harm both parties involved.<br /><br />Save some money, you can purchase bitcoins via cash through a few different methods. Bitinstant - https://www.bitinstant.com, allows for places like moneygram. https://localbitcoins.com allows connecting with individuals in your area. There are many others, and if you are interested in that avenue I also suggest visiting the bitcoin wiki proper to learn about it: http://en.bitcoin.it<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to buy 1.00 bitcoin, you can purchase smaller amounts. Most places will do much like normal currancy, anywhere from .01 and up. Its strongly suggested to start small anyways, so that you can learn and develop your understanding of the concepts here.
