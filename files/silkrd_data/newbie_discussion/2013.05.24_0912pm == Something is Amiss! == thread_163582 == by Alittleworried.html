As far as cleaning house, etc., there&#039;s no need for that. I&#039;m 99.99% sure that what you saw was benign, but if you can provide more info I can determine it with certainty.<br /><br />Libertas

				Because I closed it shut so quickly I cant say what else was there, I freaked when I saw my personal folder and just closed it. I think its fishy sorry I cant provide more details Libertas.

				I&#039;m pretty sure it was just an error with torbrowser and the message included torbrowser&#039;s path.. I don&#039;t think the name of one of your folder would be transmitted over tor anyway.
