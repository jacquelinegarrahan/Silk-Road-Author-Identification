				Usually it won&#039;t take that long, but just wait for a few more hours. If there&#039;s a confirmation on the blockchain, the transaction must be successful.

				good to know! thanks jack n hoff. just curious if the deposit and withdraws are paused for the time being and people have over 6 conformation and the coins are ready to be sent to your SR wallet, so my question is where are the coins in the mean time while DPR is fixing the problem?
