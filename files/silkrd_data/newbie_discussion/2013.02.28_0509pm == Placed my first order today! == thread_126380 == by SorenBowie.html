				Well, I&#039;ve spent the last couple of weeks hanging out on this forum and getting to know a few of you awesome people. I&#039;ve researched BitCoins and how to keep my transactions anonymous. I&#039;ve become pretty good with PGP and TOR and using a VPN to mask my IP...<br /><br />Now it is time to get off the sidelines and into the game for real!!<br /><br />Thanks to all of the veteran members that helped me get up to speed on how to stay safe on the road! <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping this is the start of a long and fruitful new way to get what I need :)<br /><br />Have a great day, everyone!!<br /><br />

				ive also spent about the last month browsing SR, and the forums, getting to know well established vendors, etc...finally placed my first order with sourdieselman yesterday, was marked in transit this morning when I checked on it..im overly excited and cant wait to receive my first package...and all this has ignited a spark in me, im absolutely fascinated with security and encryption..oh, and ive also made a little bit of money off my bitcoins sitting in my bitfloor account, and my half a bitcoin in my wallet here LOL

				Way to get learned before you commit to an order. I got too antsy and made an order with a FE to a reputable seller. Turns out to be the wrong time to order from this seller and I am now wishing I had done a little more research. I have two other orders on their way as well that look promising. I&#039;m just a kid in a candy shop with such easy access to psychedelics on the Road.&nbsp; :P<br />Its been difficult to get quality lucy in my area lately, so SR is a godsend.
