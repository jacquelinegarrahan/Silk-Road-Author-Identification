				Hope this helps someone, I know I&#039;m a bit slow at times, but getting bitcoins reasonably easy was a bit of a pain. I had success with this method today, so I know it works well. In US, cant tell you if it works this way anywhere else. <br /><br />Opened bitfloor and blockchain accounts. I did not have to provide any significant ID. I created a cash deposit to bitfloor via Bank Of America. Walked in, asked for an out of town deposit slip, filled it out, again no ID mentioned. Bam, done. <br /><br />Checked bitfloor in about 15 minutes, USD was in. I then moved it to blockchain wallet, just to move it around a bit. Then sent it to its final destination. <br /><br />Easy, clean and if you have a BofA, convenient. Hope this helps.

				Use a bit coin client. This will give you an bitcoin address/wallet. Then fund it from bitfloor, then transfer from your wallet (through the blockchain) to SR.<br /><br />As far as I know this is what is meant<br />
