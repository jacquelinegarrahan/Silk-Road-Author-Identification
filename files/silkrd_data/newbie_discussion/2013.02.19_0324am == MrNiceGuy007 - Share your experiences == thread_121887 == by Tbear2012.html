				I recently purchased some cocaine from MNG and couldn&#039;t find anything about him except a brief board about samples he sent out a while ago. Well I waited three days for my order to be marked shipped and was freaking out because I decided to take a chance with a new vendor. The half g of yayo was like $80 after shipping (where I live this usually buys at least a teener!) but I&#039;ve lost my connections over the years so I&#039;m at the mercy of the road. The price is a bit ridiculous in my opinion, but its worth it to get quality. <br /><br />Anyways, order came in pretty good packaging and was top notch quality. I like to smoke it so I cook my white so when its bad I know immediately. I was able to get back exactly what I put in cooking and the potency was delightful. I will definitely be ordering from this vendor again because its nice knowing that when I&#039;m going to be paying top dollar that I&#039;ll be getting top quality. He communicated well and was apologetic for the 3 day delay and sent a lil extra to make up. I just want to get everyone else&#039;s experiences with this vendor so we can hopefully confirm that we have a new asset to the road.
