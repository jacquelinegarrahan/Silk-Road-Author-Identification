				hello again<br />my pattern of posts here seems to largely be on the current news articles on drug use in America as opposed to SR itself, my apologies if some of you find these posts to be simply not pertinent in this forum<br /><br />in any case, NY Times has recently published an article (yet AGAIN- allowing the article to AGAIN receive much publicity and the coveted honor of being the most read article for the time being)<br /><br />link to a supplementary piece that highlights readers&#039; submission on their own experiences on prescription drug use during high school:<br />http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/10/education/stimulants-student-voices.html?ref=us<br /><br />link to the main article; story on addiction to amphetamines: <br />http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/concerns-about-adhd-practices-and-amphetamine-addiction.html?src=me&amp;ref=general<br /><br />for me, drug use during high school is hard to relate; it is perhaps hard to believe but I was quite oblivious to the probable ubiquitous use of drug abuse- esp stimulants- during my high school years; it not until my years in university when I was first exposed to off-label use of such drugs- for academic enhancement purposes (although the enhancement effect can be an arguable conclusion); It has since been just a few years since I graduated from University and I still have a particular regimen that includes off-label use of amphetamine-based stimulants, although I am coming to find modafinil to be a more palpable and sustainable stimulant to use for such purposes; I hardly use stimulants for recreational intentions<br /><br />how about my SR peers? when was your first exposure to adderall, stimulants off-label? was it really during high school where the aforementioned articles purport to be &quot;disturbingly&quot; high in abuse? what about in contrast to your college years? and lastly, what is your dependency on these class of drugs like now compared to 1. your use during high school/college years and your main reasons behind using them-recreational vs productivity, especially depending on the type of professional industry you are presently working in? (mine is business development so one can only imagine the high stress level, and the amount of vigilance that is required of such a career...for now anyways; hoping to transition into another career with less stress) 2. compared to other class of drugs such as anti-psychotics, benzos, sleep meds, etc? in other words, have stimulants served as a &quot;gateway drug&quot; to other drugs, including weed?<br />

				Your going to have to excuse me I didn&#039;t read the whole article but from the few paragraphs I did read I get the general jist of it,I can&#039;t comment on the student side or as a stimulant user whether that be pharma chem&#039;s or street chem&#039;s,but I can give you a good reply from the perspective of someone living outside the US but with very very close link&#039;s to the US,and honestly I find it very disturbing that doctor&#039;s turn to the prescription pad the second any child has a thought of they&#039;re own that isn&#039;t drilled into them or a if a child is a little rowdy,they children that&#039;s what children do,they shouldn&#039;t be drugged for that take them onto a field for a game of football or whatever if a kid&#039;s got alot of energy why not use that child&#039;s energy as a positive aspect instead of tryig to drug it out of the child,I think we have around 14k children on ritalin in the Uk and it&#039;s a touchy subject, children&#039;s brain&#039;s are like a sponge and if they&#039;re all strung out on ritalin and addorill how the hell are these people then meant to go onto be healthy member&#039;s of society, I think 21 million was the last recorded number for children on prescribed stim&#039;s for ADHD or ADD,I mean what if Thomas Edison had been given ritalin, or Albert Einstein,because pretty much all the greatest mind&#039;s in history have been energetic children,but drugging energetic children then open&#039;s the door to why they don&#039;t want children to be energetic and to think for themselve&#039;s and the fact that most of the parent&#039;s with children prescribed these drug&#039;s are keeping the big pharma corp&#039;s in business or some parent&#039;s that actually want they&#039;re children to be prescribed the stim&#039;s,I could go on to talk about the presure some parent&#039;s put on they&#039;re kid&#039;s to succeed at such an early age and then even more so when they attend university or collage,I wonder if so many children would be on the stim&#039;s if it wasn&#039;t as profitable,my fiance&#039;s son&#039;s school told her he needed to be on stim&#039;s because he had ADD because he just wasn&#039;t interseted in the school work it was too easy if you can beleive that and so instead of keeping him occupied by moving him forward a year or working with him the first thought was oh he need&#039;s drugging,the kid&#039;s a god damn genius,he&#039;s 14 and can keep up with my conversation&#039;s on world event&#039;s and geo politic&#039;s anything I can speed talk on for a couple of hour&#039;s he can keep up,now I dont claim to be clever i&#039;m shokingly bad at math,my short term memory is so bad I forget what i&#039;m talking about mid sentance sometime&#039;s mainly because i&#039;m going off topic and moving from 1 topic to another just like I did back there &lt;&lt;, thankfully she refused and removed him from that school to be homeschooled by some english guy with half a dozen letter&#039;s after his name,I certainly don&#039;t think that anychild should be exposed to any chem&#039;s that arnt totally nessasary,by the time your in high school or collage I think your old enough to make your own choice&#039;s or atleast should be old enough.<br />Peace<br />&nbsp;8)

				If you can&#039;t pay attention through an entire sentence then you probably require meds, or therapy.&nbsp; Might i suggest some Ritalin?
