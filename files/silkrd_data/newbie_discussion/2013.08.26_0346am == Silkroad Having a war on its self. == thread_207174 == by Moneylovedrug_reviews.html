				the scammers found about SR from reddit, the btc for moneypak seems to be the easiest and quickest scam they pull<br />Also people can be tracked on sites like craigslist, if you post they need a phone number to verify, etc.<br />it really sucks cuz these scammers ruin it for the rest.<br />

				Nah the badness only forces people to be safer and focus. I guess if ur bad enough to get scammed your bad enough to be caught and should be a wakeup call to your practices.

				SR literally had a front page article on Forbes website. DPR interviewed with them. This is going to keep growing, and naturally more risk will present itself.&nbsp; Just use common sense and do your research. It&#039;s amazing what a LITTLE effort can do to keep you safe.
