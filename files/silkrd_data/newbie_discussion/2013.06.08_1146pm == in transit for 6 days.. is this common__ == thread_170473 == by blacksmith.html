				for me personally id say monday is the limit then you should talk to someone but like others have said marked in transit does not always mean they will ship or have shipped that day... Your still in the early stages of something going wrong seeing as he &quot;supposedly shipped it&quot; even if he runs out he has already sent yours. obviously no mail tonight so mondays your best bet! then if it doesn&#039;t&nbsp; take a step in the right direction I wouldnt go to drastic yet!

				If you check more in the forums you will find a number of threads regarding slow transit times of late with downsizing of USPS &amp; reshuffling of personnel &amp; having less facilities open definitely has had an effect on delivery times.&nbsp; There are a number of people complaining of 10 - 12 days with priority with some over 3 weeks!&nbsp; Not all have been affected, some still get out in 2-3 days, but more are taking a little longer, &amp; a few are taking way too long.<br /><br />NCK

				I just had a package marked in transit on May 31st arrive today.<br /><br />Main thing is, a vendor hitting the In Transit button doesnt mean it is in transit.&nbsp; It probably just means he packaged it up and it is sitting in a pile to go to the PO.
