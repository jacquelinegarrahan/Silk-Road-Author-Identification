				well, everyone gets ripped off sometimes not just noobs, but you know what they say about low hanging fruit, anyway if the noobs would take the time to educate themselves about how things work on the road and do research on the forum about who you should be able to trust you shouldn&#039;t have that problem, iv never once gotten ripped off and iv been here about 2 years now.

				Hey blacksmith.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never scammed anyone, new or old, and I never will.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry you&#039;ve been ripped off.&nbsp; Many of us have been.&nbsp; I was scammed for $400, early on.&nbsp; I learned to never, ever FE, and if you don&#039;t FE, you won&#039;t be scammed again.<br /><br />That said, most vendors here on SR are honest and professional.&nbsp; Most buyers are also honest, and most of them are polite.&nbsp; But I read through your posts, and you/re not one of those buyers.&nbsp; You&#039;re a fucking bigot, and although I wouldn&#039;t scam you, I also wouldn&#039;t knowingly do business with you.&nbsp;

				Good to hear that you&#039;re not a bigot. Now lay off the posting about faggots and queers and niggers all the time, so that you won&#039;t look like one.<br /><br />@candles, FE is Finalizing Early. It&#039;s when you release your money from escrow, to the vendor, before you get your goods.<br /><br />blacksmith, if you didn&#039;t FE, then it sucks that you haven&#039;t gotten your dope in a timely manner, and I&#039;d be pissed too, but you can still send it to resolution and get your money back so that this vendor can&#039;t rip you off.&nbsp; Good job protecting yourself and choosing not to FE.&nbsp; May 31st isn&#039;t that long.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that the vendor just marked it in transit before he actually shipped it.&nbsp; That&#039;s against SR policy, and it&#039;s shitty business, but in that situation at least you get your shit.
