				New to SR and trying to set everything up to start making purchases. Any suggestions on the delivery location? Would a P.O. Box be the best way to go? How risky is it to have purchases sent to my home address? Any other thoughts or suggestions will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

				Home for sure. If you are nervous about getting a package start ordering stuff you need from Amazon, eBay or other online vendors. The thing I don&#039;t like about PO boxes is this. When it gets to the PO a clerk sorts all the packages and sends them to the carrier or box section. Once in the box section a different clerk sorts through again and puts it in you box. But you probably would rent the smallest box so it won&#039;t fit in and you have to go to the counter to get it. This would be by a different clerk most likely. Just too many eyes for my comfort.

				Consider: if you go out of your way to get a PO box to receive a package... is that not kinda weird?<br /><br />Just fit in with what is normal.&nbsp; If you are not ordering seriously large quantities, the safest and least suspicious address is probably your house.

				For big stuff you&#039;d need a shell company owned property (ideally industrial). If you have the resources for big movements for that kinda stuff you would naturally have security personnel and other pieces in place to make everything function and being &#039;hidden&#039; from raids.
