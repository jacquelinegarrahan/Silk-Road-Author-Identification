				Hey guys,<br /><br />on my first orders I didn&#039;t include a PGP key. :(<br />Now the status on these orders is processing for 3 days and I haven&#039;t heard anything from the vendors.<br /><br />Should I give them some more time or does doing something stupid as this simply keep them from sending out?

				Not providing a PGP key has nothing to do with the status of your order. The vendor could be busy or MIA for any number of reasons. After 4 days, you&#039;ll see the option to cancel your order, which won&#039;t affect your stats. If I were you, I would cancel. 4 days is more than enough for a a vendor to send out your order. Sometimes these things happened.<br /><br />It happened on my first order. I got no response from the vendor and sent them a message. After 4 days I canceled. A month later they sent me a response saying they had been in jail for a month for unrelated reasons. Like I said, shit happens.<br />

				Thanks mate, <br />I really wanted to stop buying from the street or &quot;friends&quot; who can&#039;t deliver quality in time. Guess I&#039;ll wait some more days and then just cancel.<br /><br />Next time I&#039;ll provide PGP 100%, was really stupid not to.<br />If any of you want the names of the vendors I&#039;m buying from, just PM me, maybe give me a little feedback if you like.<br /><br />Thanks anyway and have a happy weekend!

Give the vendor a chance to respond. Include your PGP key in a message if you feel they need to send you encrypted messages, but otherwise it is rather unnecessary. Check the vendor&#039;s page and see if they have been active, check your sent messages to see if they have been read, and if you aren&#039;t getting responses then think about cancelling. Otherwise just sit tight and let the process work. <br /><br />Welcome to the community, you are about to experience great things!
