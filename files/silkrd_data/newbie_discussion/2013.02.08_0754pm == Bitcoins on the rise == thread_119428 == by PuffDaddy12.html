				As long as sellers match their prices, the Bitcoin price itself doesn&#039;t really matter for the buying process. It just makes it way to easy to lose money in the exchange process (for both sides), which is why I&#039;d be incredibly happy with a stable Bitcoin exchange rate.

				A month ago 1 BTC was around Â£8-8.50. It&#039;s pretty much doubled in a month, and is steadily on the rise.<br /><br />I knew I should have hoarded some. Though I suppose everyone says that.

Think about how much money you spend just to convert your money into bitcoins, it&#039;s a percentage of the dollar amount. If you convert 1bc for $50 and they charge you, let&#039;s just say 5% to make it simple (this isnt a realistic estimate) then you pay&nbsp; $2.50 to convert 1bc whereas 1bc that costs $100 would end up costing you $5 to convert. When were talking about drugs, were talking about converting a few hundred dollars and what it comes down to is were getting charged out the ass for conversion. It&#039;s all probably a conspiracy for bitcoin handlers to make more money. I mean think about it, why would prices still be climbing so steadily while the price is increasing? it should be the opposite or slowing down or staying the same. Seems shady if you ask me.

				Bitcoins are the best investment there is!&nbsp; Better than the stock market, better than silver and gold and better than real estate.&nbsp; Bit coins have risen in value over 1300 percent and will continue to increase in value over the long run unless the Feds shut the Bitcoin monetary system down.

				I love&nbsp; Bitcoins because they are not controlled by the corrupt central banking monopoly system and are not taxable and also transactions are anonymous.

				I think a lot of sellers list their products in USD so the price stays the same but the ammount of BTC changes.<br /><br />could be mistaken on that but I don&#039;t think I am <br /><br />
