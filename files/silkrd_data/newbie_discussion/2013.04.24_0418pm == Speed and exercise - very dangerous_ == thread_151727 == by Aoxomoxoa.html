				Hi!<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken today:<br />t+0: 28mg speed<br />t+2.5: 20mg speed<br /><br />Got a message from my brother asking if we could go for a run later. That would be at t+4.5h. I don&#039;t know much about amphetamines. Today is my first time doing them. I&#039;m usually in to spiritual stuff like tryptamines, acid and the like. Just really wanted to clean my house thoroughly ;-)<br /><br />So would go running be a bad idea?<br />Is it too straining on the heart?<br />The run would be quite slow, ~7km in about 35-40minutes. I&#039;m mid twenties and quite fit, but don&#039;t regularly exercise.

				Beautiful answer!<br /><br />I&#039;m not impatient on delayed answers. It was just my slight frustration with this new newbie thing. Well, I know it&#039;s for the greater good, but this time I would have really appreciated to post this in Harm reduction. It would have fitted nice there.<br /><br />And yes, this speed is really working. Will be careful as hell with it. Not going to use it recreationaly or regularly. It&#039;s just a great tool to get boring but necessary things done that you usually procrastinate. Man I got a nice clean home now!&nbsp; ;D

Full on, physical dancing for hours. So I&#039;d say go for the run but make it a gentle one and don&#039;t go mad.<br /><br />Remember that speed is &#039;false energy&#039; and any overexertion you do will have to be paid back by your body once you come down. So take it easy, eat healthily, drink enough water and keep your fingers crossed.<br /><br />Most people would be fine but there are a few young lads who have had heart attacks in similar situation to yours. Taking speed and going running could exacerbate any unknown heart problems you may have.<br /><br />So, you pays your money...you takes your chances dude.<br /><br /><br />Be safe.

				I&#039;m alive!<br /><br />Went for a 35 minute run in talking-pace. Listned carefully to my heart. Won&#039;t make this a habit, but you can&#039;t really say no to your brother who has no idea you are tweaking ;)<br /><br />Now it&#039;s time for a plate of Spaghetti Bolognese! According to my calculations I should get down in about 1-2 hours. Let&#039;s see how I feel then. <br /><br />I&#039;m still interested if anyone else has more input on the subject. Really how dangerous is it? If you pace yourself and run in the same way you normally would, how unhealthy/dangerous is that? Is the danger only in going harder than you normally would?<br /><br />Peace and thank you for your help!

				Professional cyclist, way back when, used to be big users.&nbsp; Tom Simpson died on the Mt Ventoux leg of the 67 Tour de France high as a kite&nbsp; So I am guessing if you don&#039;t go mad its probably not so bad.&nbsp; That said, a mate of mine went for a (much longer than when sober) run after clubbing on speed and although he felt fine afterwards, when he woke up the next day he could hardly walk and was fucked for about a week.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />--Torque

				You can exercise on speed as long as you use presence of mind. A run is much better than weight-lifting on speed at least. What you don&#039;t want is to overexert yourself beyond what your body is capable of. If you can&#039;t run sober, don&#039;t run on speed. You don&#039;t want to be a &#039;weekend warrior&#039; as that is linked to muscle damage due to overstraining body parts that are not yet conditioned. <br /><br />Try to keep to a pace that you think you could typically do. The fun is in ENJOYING it more, not in pushing yourself beyond what you are capable of. It&#039;s better to err on the side of caution and not wind up injured.

				It&#039;s like the incredible hulk. As long as the heart rate stays under 200.5 beats per second, then only benefit will come to you. Exercise is good. Green hugeness mutation, not so much.

				I am very cautious! Don&#039;t feel like I want to die just yet.<br /><br />So, what you are saying OrderOfThePhoenix, is that if you go for a run with a heart rate monitor that alarms you when you go above 190 bpm you could exercise safely? Of course, that is if you are overall healthy in every other way. No high blood pressure, no fever, etc.

				I avoid doing exercise high on anything.&nbsp; My perception of my body changes and would make injuries much worse, I imagine.
