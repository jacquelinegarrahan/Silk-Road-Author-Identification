				Yeah, would be nice if this 50 post thing weren&#039;t here. Kind of a pain in the ass but I guess it weeds out people who are lazy. Hopefully you get 50 soon and post in the main sections of the forums. Good luck.

				How is that selfish? I just want to post it in the right forum. They can still read it.<br /><br />He had a listing for &quot;top shelf&quot; og Kush. I got it and its pencil eraser sized, lots of shake, brown, dry, full of seeds, hermaphroditic, chemical tasting, no buzz (and i dont even smoke once a week, so even low grade gets me). I informed him that I was not at all satisfied. He accused me of being Law enforcement, looked into me using my address (which he is supposed to delete) and told me to meet &quot;one of his people&quot; at a restaurant near my house with 4 ounces of weed (a felony offense) and give it to some random person I don&#039;t know with no guarantee of a refund. Communication is almost impossible as English is clearly a second language for him, but he has asked me to deal with him in public outside of sr, kept and used my personal info, and has been insulting and unwilling to help.<br /><br />I am not the first person to complain, as almost all his bud gets bad reviews. His only good reviews are for his &quot;low grade&quot; bud, which I suspect to be the same stuff he sells as &quot;top shelf&quot;, and his brownies. He removed his listing after I began to complain and he was beginning to receive other bad reviews on it. He claims I am the only person to complain, but he received several bad reviews on the same product after me before he took it down.<br /><br />Upon investigating and building a case for SR resolutions, I found that his picture used on the listing was over a year and a half old, taken from a random website, and from a totally different strain than og kush. He cut the watermark off and then used it as his own for a totally different strain.<br /><br />When confronted about all of this and the quality. He became abrasive, and accused me of being law enforcement. He told me even if I go to the resolution center there will be no refund because &quot;The truth is there is no refund unless we as a vender decide too not SR. The business is between us and they can not help. If you send this to reso center we will void all offers.&quot; Essentially bring a felony amount of weed to a stranger in public or SR staff are powerless. A flat out lie.<br /><br />The weed is shit. Unsmokeable, shit. I literally threw up just from the chemical taste. I have purchased many QP from good sellers, and even when they were subpar, I have been able to work out fair resolutions. NoStress has been unable or unwilling to work professionally and fairly. He denies bad reviews, and the picture being taken from online, but I have saved his listing before he removed it, and the website where it was taken from. He has asked me to work in public after using my personal info. All of these are reasons I want a refund and he should be avoided at all costs.

				I believe his bad review ratio would be even lower if the VAST majority of his buyers didnt FE.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that that post was simply a summary and the whole one will include many more quotes and many pictures of the product as well as the listing.

				nostress vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/cdc91719f9<br /><br />seems to have really good feedback, but the whole keeping records of addresses is quite nasty business.

				His feedback is inflated due to the unusually high amount of FE&#039;s. If you look at his ratings, they are either FE&#039;s or for his brownies (Even shit weed makes ok brownies). All of his bad reviews are for bud, and they have become more frequent. He gets bad reviews from Non-FE&#039;s and then he removes and relists. His messages make it look like he has legal dispensaries and my guess is he uses the SR to dump less than dispensary level weed. Even if it wasn&#039;t some shitty ass weed, the deceptive picture and listing, the accusations, and especially keeping my address all add up to a bad vendor and he should be avoided.

				@Incognito Smoker: It seems to me that you have a decent case, especially with your message history. Please tell me that all of your communications took place over SR? You should report the vendor.

				It did indeed all take place in SR pm&#039;s. If you look at his listings, his bud pictures are taken from random websites. It looks like he just chooses ones he likes of 420magazine. Absolute bullshit vendor. Honestly he is unnerving especially when he keeps my address and looks like he tried to trap me.
