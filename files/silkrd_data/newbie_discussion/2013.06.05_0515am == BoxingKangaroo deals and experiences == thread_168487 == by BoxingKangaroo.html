				Hey guys and gals,<br /><br />New Aussie vendor here, BoxingKangaroo, thought I&#039;d better start my own thread so customers can post experiences and I can advertize cool offers or new products.<br /><br />If you visit my shop now it looks a bit empty, well it is virtually empty, had a crazy opening fortnight, you guys cleared me out haha. In the coming weeks hopefully days my stock will be back up and I&#039;ll be offering some new products, I&#039;ll try to keep stock levels up, but my main focus will be supplying high quality goods with the best service, if i run out every now and then because my deals are too good then I guess we&#039;ll have to live with that haha.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a fun little format in mind for selling one of my products, anyway I&#039;ll run it by you when I get my hands on the goodies. <br /><br />Keep an eye out for this thread, I&#039;ll try and keep it up to date <br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />

				oh of course how silly<br /><br />here is a link to the shop <br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f01861c317<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to give away to much info about future listings or products until a closer date. I would prefer for my deals to be spur of the moment, in and out, like a well oiled machine haha, you know why.<br /><br />just be sure to check out the thread in the future, it will keep you updated<br /><br />cheers

				Very positive experience with BoxingKangaroo!<br /><br />From rapid response to queries, through to overall processing and shipping time.<br /><br />Product came in overweight and was quite a robust smoke.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I hope BK takes on the feedback and restocks/re-lists again soon at this price point as if BK does, he will have my domestic crystal methamphetamine business. <br /><br />ABC

				Hello guys and gals,<br />Another busy week has pasted and it seems I&#039;ve started to attract the attention of some scammers and because of this I&#039;ve had to implement some new risk mitigating measures to hopefully prevent there efforts or at least reduce them.<br /><br />From this time on, customers will need to meet certain STAT requirements to make purchases. I understand that this may cut out some newbies, which I absolutely hate. Unfortunately I simply can&#039;t afford to risk my reputation and possibly lose money at this point in time, on people who are not proven legitimate SR users.<br /><br />As a lot of you will already know my prices are quite low, meaning that these scams really hurt my profit margin. In the future I will review these requirements and hopefully relax them as to let new players into the market.<br /><br />Anyway enough about these scum bags and there scamming ways (damn I really despise these people).<br /><br />I will have some very nice deals popping up in the coming week. Hopefully have a few products on the go, so keep your eyes peeled. I will of course keep the thread updated as I release them.<br /><br />Very small amount of MDMA left from last weeks sale, it will be gone by Monday night no doubt, so if you&#039;re interested make sure you get in quick.<br /><br />Cheers BK<br /><br /><br />
