				Well so much for being PC.<br /><br />We&#039;re always upping the anti so here is my latest and most eye catching lottery to date which is incredibly simple yet offers amazing odds.<br />In fact I GUARANTEE everyone will be a winner! <br /><br />Check it out: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ffbd75ee74<br /><br /><br />Statistically speaking every ticket should be a winner and don&#039;t worry even if you lose in this lottery we let you try again because we know you can do it ;) <br /><br />Twice daily results and daily payouts so wait no more than 12 hours for winnings but most likely even less as I&#039;m usually online but there may be small delays over the weekends when I&#039;m more likely to be away<br /><br />♦ ♣ ♠ ΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞHOW IT WORKSΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ♦ ♣ ♠<br /><br />When you purchase a ticket it&#039;s just like s standard scratch card ticket but in this case the transaction # is your scratch off code. <br /><br />This is randomly generated by the SR transaction system and cannot be manipulated by me or any outside force (except maybe DPR)<br /><br />♦ ♣ ♠ ΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞHOW YOU WINΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ♦ ♣ ♠<br /><br />1: First purchase the listing, (Payout is multiplied by quantity you buy but max 5 tickets at once)<br /><br />2: Your transaction # will contain 8 randomly selected hexadecimal digits in the following range (ABCDEF0123456789) <br />The number of potatoes you win depends on the amount contained in your transaction ID.<br /><br />3:Count your potatoes<br /><br />Here is how you count potato.<br /><br />&quot;0&quot; = 1 potato<br />&quot;8&quot; = 2 potatoes<br /><br />For example if your transaction ID is &quot;d9f0e268a6&quot; 0 is one potato and 8 is two potato so total winnings are 3 potato or $5<br /><br />The odds of getting either a &quot;0&quot; or &quot;8&quot; are 2/16 or 1/8 and since the transaction ID contains 8 digits statistically everyone should win! <br /><br />4: Sit back, I will send your winnings direct to your Silk Road account.<br /><br />♦ ♣ ♠ ΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞPAYOUT STRUCTUREΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ♦ ♣ ♠<br /><br />no potato:$ Refund/Free turn <br />&nbsp;1 potato: $1<br />&nbsp;2 potato: $2<br />&nbsp;3 potato: $5<br />&nbsp;4 potato: $10<br />&nbsp;5 potato: $25<br />&nbsp;6 potato: $50<br />&nbsp;7+potato: $100 jackpot<br /><br />♦ ♣ ♠♦ ♣ ♠ ΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞHIGH SCORESΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ♦ ♣ ♠♦ ♣ ♠<br /><br />Your name here<br /><br /><br />♣ ♠ ΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞRULESΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ♦ ♣<br /><br />If your game/games are unsuccessful, there can be no refunds, no exceptions.<br /><br />Win or lose, please leave a 5/5 rating. Send me a message first if you have any concerns.<br /><br />Thank you for playing!<br />Good luck!<br /><br />

				sounds pretty cool... Only thing I&#039;d do different is make it closer to a keno ticket or similar drawing where if you get 0 potato you get more than a refund. After all, it&#039;s more likely to get ONE zero or eight over NONE.

				Sorry, I didn&#039;t see the link to see it was a $5 entry before I posted about odds and everything. I thought it would&#039;ve been like a dollar or two entry so I didn&#039;t think a refund would be as fair. Still, getting zero chances out of 8 is very unlikely and should warrant a higher payout (in my opinion)

				Thanks for the input poopypants :) <br /><br />Yea I thought about making some sort of payout for getting 0 potato but seeing how it&#039;s unlikely I think a refund/free turn valued at $4.99 is even better. <br />I&#039;ll correct the grammar as well, Sorry English isn&#039;t my first language so I can get caught out with some terms like that. <br /><br />Have a free go on my other lottery for those who leave me reviews, here is the link http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7ae4a2d124<br />

				Not sure if that &quot;free spin&quot; comment was directed to me lol but I&#039;ll give it a try anyway:)<br /><br />I was going to take a try at the $4.99 lottery but my coins STILL haven&#039;t been deposited so maybe later
