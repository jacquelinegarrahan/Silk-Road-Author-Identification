				It has long been thought that grains where used which where infected with the fungun clavicepts purpura (ergot), also known as Saint Anthonies Fire. Ergot intoxication causes psychedelic like hallucinations, as well as severe vascular constriction (vasoconstriction). This often leads to gangrene, loss of limbs, and potentially even death. There really is no known way simple extraction proceedures that the ancients could have performed to seperate ergots psychoactive properties from its toxic properties.<br /><br />There was something other than just fermented grains in that drink though, pennyroyal is also said to be an ingredient in the sacred brew.<br /><br />&quot;This mint species, once known as bleehon or glechon, was apparently an ingredient of kykeon,<br />the potion drunk by initiates to the Eleusinian mysteries (Ruck 1995, 142*). Aristophanes, in Pax, mentions a drink containing pennyroyal that was named kykeon and which Hermes, the messenger<br />of the gods, recommended as a protection against disease.<br /><br />Pennyroyal was also used to produce love drinks and was considered an obscene metaphor<br />for a woman’s pubic hair and a symbol of illicit sexuality. The herbalist Bodin (1591) identified it<br />with Homer’s nepenthes. Pennyroyal was one of the most renowned abortifacients of antiquity and<br />was used medicinally to treat cramps in the lower abdomen (Ratsch 1995a, 237 f.*). In ancient times,<br />it was also burned as an incense. In South America, the dried plant is still used as a ritual incense and<br />is offered to the earth goddess Pachamama (Ott1993,412*).&quot;<br /><br />(Source: http://psychotropia.co/?p=1677)<br />Now pennyroyal (being a relatively common and legal botanical) may not seem like it would be a potent hallucinogen, but its essential oil is made up of 80-94% pulegone. Pulegone has many effects on the human body and is quite toxic, however in small doses this oil can produce delerium, auditory and visual hallucinations, unconciousness, and signs of toxicity including seizures and potentially toxic shock.<br /><br />Doesnt sound like a very fun hallucinogen, but it is one. Early civilizations where known to go to such extremes to achieve gnosis and communion with there Gods. I do however advise that nobody tries this one, as with most delerients, its best to steer clear.<br /><br />Pulegone is also metabolized into the hepatoxic compound menthofuran by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. There may be ways to prevent this compound from metabolizing into the hepatoxic menthofuran but for obvious reasons should not be attempted.<br /><br />&quot;Hepatic toxicity has been prevented by the early administration of acetylcysteine following ingestion of pennyroyal oil. 17 Various metabolite studies are available regarding hepatotoxicity. 18 , 19&quot;<br /><br />Pennyroyal is also a neurotoxin.<br /><br />&quot;Rats given oral doses of pulegone for 28 days (80 or 160 mg/kg/day) developed encephalopathic changes characterized by cyst-like spaces in the cerebellum without concomitant demyelination. This resembles the neuropathy induced in rats by administration of hexachlorophene. 21 LD 50 values for pennyroyal oil have been reported in rats and rabbits. 6 A dog treated for fleas with pennyroyal application suffered vomiting and, despite treatment, died within 48 hours. 22&quot;<br /><br />While pennyroyal sounds every bit as dangerous as ergot, perhaps even more, early civilizations would not likely have been deterred by this. Strange things such as tobacco enemas, psychoactive snakevenom, spider venom, a cardiotoxic bulb (bushmans bulb) administered through cuts in the scalp, or gulping down enough datura seeds to poison all the cattle in texas. There are no limits to mans persuit of altered states, whether there chasing samsara, trying to communicate with the dead, or just trying to numb the pain of reality, mankind has and will always use drugs. Throughout the ages from early civilizations experimenting with obscure botanicals to modern man willing to introduce into your body whatever the pharmaceutical or Research Chemical companies come out with.
