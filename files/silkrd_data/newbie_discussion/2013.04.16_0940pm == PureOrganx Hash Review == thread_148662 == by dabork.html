				So I finally got around to ordering some good hash, instead of just the cheap Moroccan that&#039;s on here.&nbsp; I wanted to go domestic for obvious reasons and came across PureOrganx.&nbsp; He had about 60 transactions when I ordered from him but had good feedback and a few good reviews so I went ahead and ordered a gram of the 45 Micron Girl Scout Cookie hash.<br /><br />He shot me a message a couple days later to let me know I had forgotten the city and state in my address (doh!), and that he had been unable to message me before then because of all the downtime.&nbsp; He got me shipped out on Friday and messaged me on Monday to let me know it should be showing up soon.&nbsp; Unfortunately, due to some issue with the address, it ended up being returned to him after making it all the way to my post office.&nbsp; So by all technicalities it arrived on Monday after ordering on Tuesday night and it being shipped on Friday.&nbsp; He checked the tracking Wednesday when it had not yet arrived and saw that there was a problem.&nbsp; A few messages later, and we had it all sorted out and I was set for a reship.&nbsp; he shipped it back out that Friday and it was in my hands on Monday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, about the actual product.&nbsp; First off, the package looked pretty good.&nbsp; Printed labels covered in tape to make them waterproof.&nbsp; Absolutely no hint of a smell until all 3 vacuum bags were broken.&nbsp; He included half a gram of the Humboldt Haze for free.&nbsp; Whether it was because of the mixup or because of the 4/20 sale, I&#039;m not sure, but free hash isn&#039;t really something I&#039;m prone to questioning.&nbsp; <br /><br />I loaded up a couple little pebbles of the GSC (it came in several small chunks, whereas the HH was in one stiffer lump) into a bowl.&nbsp; I knew this wasn&#039;t exactly the best way to be smoking it, but I wanted a taste of it quickly without looking for any of the random shit I use when I have more patience.&nbsp; The first hit was delicious.&nbsp; Smooth and nutty without any overpowering tastes.&nbsp; I let it go across my tongue as I hit it as slow as I could and felt the slight numbing I know and love.&nbsp; I watched the hash as I continued to hit it, and as expected it soon began to bubble.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t sizzle or pop, but it didn&#039;t melt down either, so I&#039;d call this half-melt.&nbsp; After about 4 strong hits, the bowl was done, and I was decidedly high.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t get a chance to try the HH for about 2 more hours because of how distracted I was.&nbsp; It was a very cerebral high with no couch lock to speak of and it creeped up for about an hour after I smoked.&nbsp; It left enough of a body tingle to lull me into a dreamy state but didn&#039;t come off as &quot;dopey&quot;.&nbsp; Overall, it was easily some of the best hash I have had the pleasure of trying, and is the next best thing to some grade A full-melt, which makes it great for people on a bit of a budget.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Humboldt Haze is some pretty standard burner hash.&nbsp; Tastes decent, leaves me pretty stoned, and makes a great bowl topper.&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s nothing compared to the GSC, but it&#039;s not supposed to be, and it was free, so I&#039;m more than satisfied.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, PureOrganx was a pleasure to deal with from beginning to end.&nbsp; He did everything in his power to make things go smoothly even after a couple bumps in the road and was easily one of the best vendors I&#039;ve bought from.&nbsp; He&#039;s pretty new but if he keeps up the work ethic he&#039;s got right now, he&#039;ll fit in here just fine.<br />I&#039;ll definitely be buying from him again, and I&#039;d encourage anyone in the US looking for a good domestic hash man to give him a shot too.

				The GSC was good but they have some super melt Fire OG which was amazing. I can&#039;t get on SR to see if they still have it but you should definitely try it if they do.
