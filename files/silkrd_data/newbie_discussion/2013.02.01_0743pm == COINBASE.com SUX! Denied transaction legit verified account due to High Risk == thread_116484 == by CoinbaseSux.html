				My Experience with Coinbase as an Everyday Type of User (very dissatisfied with service, even Paypal not this much red tape). Awaiting a response to email, but obviously, I won&#039;t be using Coinbase since they turned me away. After I signed up and went through extensive approval process to buy BC from my linked checking account (verified 2 small deposits, verified phone code, verified email) they denied transaction. What&#039;s really crazy is that I later went to their forum and found MANY others with same complaint. Their response was along the lines of &quot;yes, we get this issue alot, we have the authority to deny and transaction if we feel it is high risk.&quot;<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Dear Coinbase Owners / Operators,<br /><br />I am highly upset with your service! I went through ALL of your verification processes and bought 10 BC. Waited and waited, only 2 find out &quot;transaction not approved high risk&quot; That is insane! What the he** do u expect from me? I have had the linked account for well over 20 yrs, balance more than enough 2 pay for your max amount of 10 silly little BC. So, I verified email, phone, as well as deposit verification amounts only to be turned away. Makes no sense.<br /><br />What, so you want any of your potential customers to be turned away and leave with a very frustrating view of Coinbase?<br /><br />After all of this time has passed and I was expecting my BC, even after 6 day delay, I find I am back at square 1. So, I will just continue to either go to bank with cash purchase of BC through other services much more agreeable than yours, or else be forced to buy Moneypaks, make an exchange with someone selling BC and pay fees. In the meantime, I will express my extreme dissatisfaction with your pathetic business practices to anyone on the boards who cares to listen.<br /><br />PS-and quit trying 2 leave all of your damn cookies on my computer! Also, it is just ridiculous that you don&#039;t have a direct &quot;contact us&quot; link on your actual website, or even email contact info.
