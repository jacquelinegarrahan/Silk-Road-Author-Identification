				Hey man I saw your post and began looking at your listings. I want to buy an 8ball, but I haven&#039;t seen any official reviews on your coke in the forums. Often if something seems to good to be true, then it is. When everyone elses &quot;pure&quot; cocaine is 450+ for an 8ball and yours is 300 it leads me to severly question the quality. I have to wait for some reviews before I buy.

				Check out my feedback. There are numerous Coke reviews. <br /><br />Actually, there is some guy here on the forum who routinely does coke reviews. I saw one he just recently posted and my product was included. try doing a search for &quot;sprayman&quot; and I think it will come up. That is how I stumbled upon it.<br /><br />I have only been on the Road for a couple months, and as you can see I have 100%&nbsp; Positive Feedback. <br /><br />My Coke is ALWAYS PURE &amp; UNCUT! <br />You will Always Receive it in a Large Solid Rock with several smaller rocks to make the weight.<br />&nbsp;NO Bags of Cut Powder or re-compressed&nbsp; &quot;Social&quot; BS as many vendors sell. <br /><br />I used to do a LOT (personally over 1oz a week). I know good coke!<br /><br />You can Order with Confidence. All the things my customers say in their Feedback about me, my products, my stealth, my service , my shipping, my Kool-Ass Personality (Lol) are TRUE!<br /><br />If a Product isn&#039;t Top Shelf,&nbsp; I Won&#039;t list it!<br /><br />I am and will strive to remain a 100% 5/5 Vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lookin Forward to hearing from you,<br />Sprayman
