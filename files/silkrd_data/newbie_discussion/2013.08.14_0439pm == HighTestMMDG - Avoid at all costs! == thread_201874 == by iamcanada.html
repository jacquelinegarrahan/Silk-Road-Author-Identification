				So after a bad experience his reviews started to get better so I assumed maybe he has stepped his game up. Ordered an oz of his Green Crack which he described as the &quot;the perfect bud&quot;<br /><br />Well first off there were several issues.<br /><br />1. Unprofessional packaging<br />2. He forgot to put my address line 2 making getting my package more difficult then it should<br />3. I got 26 grams when an oz is 28.3...PLUS in addition 4 grams was shake so I got 22 grams of bud, 4 grams of shake<br />4. The weed was hay smelling, bad flush, and lots of yellow leaves<br /><br />Now the vendor responded saying I got sent his clearance weed instead, HOWEVER, is refusing to provide&nbsp; a reship or refund. I can tell you if any other vendor made this mistake they would give 100% refund if not 100% reship.<br /><br />DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS SCAMMING CUNT VENDOR. HE HAS THE WORST SERVICE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.<br /><br />There are some great Canadian vendors out there, but I can tell you this guy is not one of them.

				Honestly...<br /><br />I have to cry foul... I honestly don&#039;t believe hightestmmdg would do that.<br /><br />I just received the perfect ounce.. this Monday.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s hands down the craziest ass best smoke i have ever encountered.&nbsp; The stench was a cross between Lemon, ammonia and diesel fuel.&nbsp; My friend who has some just left me a message on my phone... He heading to the Black Sabbath Concert tonight....&nbsp; Before Hanging up he ended the message with...<br /><br />&quot;Oh dude!! That Green Crack Really is Crack&quot;.&nbsp; He was super enthusiastic.<br /><br />Although perhaps it&#039;s a coincidence, but my ounce weighed in at a portly 30.5 grams.&nbsp; Oh and Zero shake.<br /><br />I&#039;ll also add this.. Out of my orders thus far, all of them had:<br /><br />Zero Shake<br />Were on point or over<br />Super well manicured (hardly a stock to be trimmed anywhere)<br /><br />Products tried so far..<br /><br />AAA PK - QP (Best PK i have ever tried)<br />AA Romulan - QP<br />AAA+ Green Crack - If god were a bud this is it.<br />3 Grams Budder - IF hippies had this in the 60&#039;s they would of never made it to woodstock. lol AMazing.<br /><br />

				Umm maybe you should read the whole post...<br /><br />He said I was sent his clearance weed instead by accident. He outsources his shipping and can&#039;t control mistakes. Now he refuses to make it right. <br /><br />And there are several other complains, not just mine. Several people have reported not receiving and having horrible customer service. Every other vendor out there I have tried has been better. <br /><br />So I say you stop sucking his balls, unless you are him made a new account spammed to 50 and trying to save your name before people realize you are worthless scum and don&#039;t belong on SR

				Honestly I can see both sides... I can just share my experience... Sounds very fishy to me.<br /><br />I did a quick check and it turns out you also slammed his bud in a post back in June... Now after slamming his bud back then you came back and ordered more from him only to slam him again.&nbsp; And during all that time your still a Newbie.<br /><br />So as you can understand, It&#039;s easy to have doubts about your story as you doubt mine.<br /><br />To me you sound like your just trying to damage you competition.... I could be wrong though, there is that possibility.<br /><br />As for me... I&#039;m not sure if an admin could check my stats or purchase history, but I doubt I would purchase a few thousand dollars of product off myself (and I have 4 grand more in other purchases waiting to arrive from others).<br /><br />People will believe what they will believe.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace.

				I did try him before HENCE why I said I decided to give him a try again. Going through your post history either you are him, work for him, or are balls deep with him in your mouth.<br /><br />Maybe if you are international the weed in your country sucks and then I could believe that you liked his weed. But if you have ordered off ANY other Canadian vendor every single one offers better bud. <br /><br />Beachcomber and PKHydro offer great bud WAAY better then MMDG and have 1000x better communication and support. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve have ordered from PKhydro before and another vendor.&nbsp; PKhydro is definately top notch aswell.<br /><br />Out of your three options.... being:<br /><br />1. Are him... negative<br />2. work for him... Negative<br />3. balls deep with him in my mouth... Possibly true, but it&#039;s only cause his product was steller, and believe it or not his communication has been excellent.&nbsp; My only grip lately was a slow round of deliveries of late.

				I was going to leave this one alone because iamcanada is an obvious troll. <br />I don&#039;t feel the need to respond to every idiot out there who says something negative about me because as anyone can see, I have completed hundreds of transactions with very very few unhappy customers.<br />However when you started going after my customers you crossed a line and I felt the need to respond.<br /><br />First of all, I am not Poobinator. I maintain my own forum presence, I make all my comments in the open and I don&#039;t feel the need to comment from other accounts. I wish other vendors could say the same.<br /><br />When I first received your complaint about your order on SR, I attempted to deal with you in good faith. Based on what you claimed to have received, I figured it was possible that you had accidentally received something that I have designated as clearance weed. Mistakes can happen. Even though no operation is perfect, I will always do my best to solve any problems that arise, regardless of whether they were caused on my end.<br /><br />As for the product, I never sell anything that smells like hay, even as clearance.<br />Because what you claimed to have received sounded a bit over the top I decided to look up your username on the forums.<br />I found a post that you made in June making similar ridiculous claims about my product, BEFORE YOU HAD EVER ORDERED FROM ME.<br />At this point I knew that you were either another vendor trying to go after my rating and reputation or a troll/scammer trying to get some free product. <br />Because of this I decided to eat the 1/5 feedback and keep the money that you paid for the excellent product that you received.<br />

				Holy crap... the shit vendors have to deal with.<br /><br />Sorry that happened to you MMDG... It makes sense I guess though; someone doesn&#039;t like you, perhaps a sting op vendor?<br /><br />Either way, I&#039;ve looked you up before, and you look promisining. In fact, I might order from you in the future :)<br /><br />

But with what is currently taking place between the two of us, this story does not seem so far fetched. I hope it is a lie though.<br /><br />I am posting about this publicly to gain your attention, which used to be as simple as sending a message before I ordered.<br /><br />I ordered a large pack from HighTestMMDG. He claims the tracking indicates the package should have shown up 6 days ago. And HighTestMMDG has not responded, or even read, any messages from me in the last 5 days. He has been logging in these past few days so I know he has had the chance to see these messages. I do not understand why you would start ignoring my concerns right as the &quot;delivery date&quot; passes.<br /><br />I do not want drama. I would simply like you to check the tracking and let me know what it says. I am looking to continue business and hoping this works out. ALL of my regular vendors for other products get right back to me. At most with in a few days. Here are my stats:<br /><br />total transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$65,730.00<br />total vendors&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%
