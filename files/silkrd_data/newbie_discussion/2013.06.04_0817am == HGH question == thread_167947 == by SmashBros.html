				Hey man<br /><br />At 19 you sure you got everything else dialled in? Diet especially? Do that first.<br /><br />What you trying to do? Bulk?<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe you&#039;ve plateaud at that age bro. <br /><br />I would make sure everything is right and proper with diet, training, sleep/rest, frequency, intensity of the weights/training&nbsp; BEFORE fucking about with growth hormone or even a small roid cycle. There is so much more you could do than pop a pill or jab some jintropin/or whatever.<br /><br />IMVHO obviously<br /><br />terp
