				Alright, so when you place an order funds are taken out of your account. These funds are not released to the vendor until you click finalize. Finalizing early is when you finalize before receiving product. The problem with this is if you dont receive the product the vendor already has your money. On the other hand if you dont finalize until you get the product and inspect it, you can go into resolution if something is wrong (doesnt come/bunk) Then you can usually at least get some of your money back.

				thanks for the response<br /><br />WHEN you say &quot;....funds are taken out of your account...&quot; , are you saying i deposit the funds in an account with SR before placing an order, like an ewallet or are you saying the payment for a particular purchase goes to an SR account<br /><br />sorry for the basic type questions but this stuff is all new to me<br /><br />tks in advance

				I think a better explanation is this:<br />SR acts as a sort of &#039;middle man&#039; for your funds while the vendor is shipping the items. Once you make an order the BC are transferred to a holding account. Once you receive your product and you&#039;re happy with it you can finalize your order which releases the BC to the vendor.<br /><br />Finalizing early refers to the practice of releasing the BC as soon as you make your order, some vendors use this so they have more time to cash out their BC and keep up their stock levels.<br />However as soon as you finalize your order it is considered completed by SR and you will have no guarantee that the vendor will actually ship your product, so this is why people recommend not FEing.<br />While your order is still in escrow you have the option to receive extensions/refunds etc through customer support.
