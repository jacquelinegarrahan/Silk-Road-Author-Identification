				Edit for clarity: by verify I mean provide my DL and residence so MG will allow direct bank transfers.<br /><br />I think I must be missing some very basic understanding of bitcoin: I&#039;ve looked, I promise.<br /><br />I understand that bitcoin transactions are public at blockchain.info, but if I can create a new wallet address for every incoming transaction, why is it dangerous for personal info to be linked with a particular wallet address?<br /><br />I have yet to send any bitcoin, but it looks like I only have to input the recipient&#039;s address to do so. However, transactions at blockchain, do display address associated with the sender. Is this where the danger comes in? Why can&#039;t I just make sure the address displayed is different from the one linked to my personal info?

				i am not an expert. also i don&#039;t know if you are asking about verifying at Mt. Gox or about bitcoin transfers? Perhaps you&#039;re asking about transfers out of Mt. Gox to an address?<br /><br />Not knowing specifically what you are asking, if you are worried about your transaction being pegged to an address, you can send your coins through a mixer so that the transaction is distributed and harder to trace.<br /><br />Really for practical purposes, unless you have a small fortune in bitcoins-- enough that the transaction would raise some peoples curiosity examining large transactions or large amounts of coins in a single address---i would not go crazy.<br /><br />The act of verifying an account with Mt. Gox is not setting yourself up for anything. I&#039;ve done it. What i do not do is send coins straight out of Mt.GOx to another address.

				Not *that* terrible but if you&#039;re really worried about your name being tied to an address use a laundering service. Also, if you aren&#039;t making purchases of $500+ just use bitinstant and the same fake name for everything&nbsp; :)

				I had to. But I made sure to send it to my blockchain wallet first, then to SR. No worries.
