				In terms of personal protection, from what I&#039;ve read the easiest (and safest) thing to do is load a linux distro like Libirte to a USB drive and boot from that whilst keeping your PGP keys on a separate and very safe drive. People say to encrypt the drive containing keys and such as well, but I suppose that depends on how far you want to go with it. <br /><br />On another note with the boot drive, I know that libirte comes with tor pre-configured&nbsp; and is fairly secure.

				There used to be a lot more stickies in each of the subforums. In fact, at one time, a majority of the threads on the first page of Security and Off Topic were stickies, but almost all of them were removed under a new policy that only threads created by mods/admins can be stickied -- except for a few in Shipping, I guess.<br />

Once a mod has reviewed the thread it would be locked.
