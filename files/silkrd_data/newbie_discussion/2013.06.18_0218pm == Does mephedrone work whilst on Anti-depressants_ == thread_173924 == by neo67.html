				ahhh shoot! it does smell and taste like Mephedrone though so i am still in the knowledge that its the antidepressants that are stopping the effects,<br />i have read many,many information saying that SSRI&#039;s reduce the effect of MDMA....it may be the same for mephedrone you see but i am not 100% sure.<br /><br />Does anyone else know anything on this matter or had any experiences taking SSRI&#039;s and mephedrone???, there is little information on the internet (google) explaining the drug interactions between mephedrone and SSRI&#039;s...<br /><br />Please help someone lol!

				If your on prescribed ssri&#039;s stay well away from mephedrone Mephedrone will mess upyour seretonin and dopamine regulation Which will have a counter effect om the ssri&#039;s The cheap Mephedrone people have reported depression

				Any more advice guys...I&#039;ve had to&nbsp; do REALLY big doses to feel any effect of the mephedrone, not recommended though BIG dose are hard to sniff or consume in other ways.<br /><br />Any more experiences with drone whilst on antidepressants (SSRI&#039;s) is welcome people<br /><br />:)

				I know, but they were over significant periods of time....were talking 6/7 hours per dose. It took me about a day to do a gram.<br /><br />Looking back it was a stupid thing to do as it was a bit of waste of money to be honest as the high felt like it was being restricted somewhat.<br /><br />My advice....don&#039;t do drone whilst on AD&#039;s (SSRI&#039;S) or the other AD&#039;s. I am going to wait until im off them&nbsp; now, I&#039;m not getting off them solely to do other drugs, it&#039;s because i don&#039;t need them anymore (whahey)<br /><br />Thanks for your concern anyway mate.<br /><br />Peace and love.

				A good friend of mine is on SSRI&#039;s and has been for some time, he finds that MDMA has very little affect on him now but he still takes a lot of mephedrone obviously it is not to be recommended as you can end up with serotonin syndrome but he definitely gets effects from the drone while taking SSRI&#039;s.

				No Probably not, have not research it but because mephedrone works on the serotonin it cant get effects from that part. And it is really not good to use serotonin drugs while on a anti-depressant. Search more on it.

				You still get effect of course since it is a stimulant to and works on the dopamine witch is not affected by SSRI, But the serotonin part (MDMA RC) Cant get released if you are on SSRI. So if you are on SSRI is really NOT good to take Mephedrone since It can leave&nbsp; you with big side effects including death. So my tips to you all who is on ssri. Buy Amphetamine or Cocaine instead who only works on the dopamine and you don&#039;t Risks yourself of the big side effects. Its really Stupid.

				Mephedrone blocks serotonin re-uptake and also releases it, so combining these can result in a serotonin syndrome which can be deadly.<br /><br />Not sure if it causes similar effects as MDMA taken with meth or mephedrone, they were proven to increase each others toxicity. It had something to do with over-excitement of the affected neurotransmitters.
