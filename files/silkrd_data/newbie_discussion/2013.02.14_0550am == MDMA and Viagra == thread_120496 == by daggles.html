				Cialis is a generic version of Viagra. <br />In simple terms: Same stuff, but not produced by Pfizer - the company behind Viagra. <br /><br />Essentially though, many people DO seem to report that the on-set for Cialis is much quicker than Viagra, active at only 15 minutes in some cases. Also reporting that the effects last longer.<br /><br />In my personal experience with mdma + Cialis, I find that it helps enormously with achieving that initial erection. I had the same problem as you. <br /><br />I like a high mdma dose, 200g + mostly. And once the Cialis gets you up, you&#039;re on your way.&nbsp; The mdma &#039;takes over&#039; and makes good use of your Cialis kick-start.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Incidentally, a well fitted cock-ring is also a lot of fun when thrown into the mdma/Cialis mix.

				hey Android,<br />I am no expert i must say but i am pretty certain cialis is not generic viagra, its a different drug altogether(probably same family or something tho) &amp; it works differently, with Viagra you can feel all your blood vessels pumping hard, you can feel it in your face,eyes,head &amp; its not very pleasant, i didnt get any of these side effects with Cialis tho, just a rock hard cock (not constantly but was always ready for action when required) &amp; fuck me it works for well over 24 hrs ! again much different to viagra.

Pfizer hold the patents for it but manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs known as &quot;generic viagra&quot;, is common in India where Pfizer&#039;s patent claim does not apply. Marketed as Kamagra brand name I think.<br /><br />So I think you&#039;re right. Same active ingredient, just different formula.<br /><br />Also, I misspelled Sildenafil as cildenafil. lol <br /><br />Its the same stuff though. I&#039;ve had Viagra, and the Indian generic versions.<br />Viagra however, did give me terribly blocked sinuses though. Kamagra didn&#039;t.<br />

				tbh though, if I take 300mg of mdma, my cock will shrink to the size of a grape. lol<br /><br />Pop some viagra down the hatch and it kick-starts the erection. After that, you&#039;re free to fuck away for hours. <br /><br />Sextacy. Definitely heard this term somewhere used to describe combining viagra and mdma.

				Dont know how old you people are but i am hoping you are young and therefore i too can get a lift. Had some methedrone for the first time and got my wife in the cot, rockin it a storm when i had an instant flop, dead in the water. Never had it happen so quick.<br />Do these meds support a methy penis as well?<br />Can some one recomend good combination drugs for mephedrone, i like it but it needs a little tweek.
