				Hello and greetings from Midwestern USA. <br /><br />After conferring with my various partners, we have decided that the time has come to evaluate our brand to a national scope. We are looking to build the &quot;Slacker&quot; brand, and we intend to do so with a 3 pronged attack:<br /><br />1)Outstanding communication with our client base.<br /><br />2) Flawless and rapid shipping. <br /><br />3) Unbelievably strong MDMA and MDA product. <br /><br />What we are about:<br />We are fully cognizant of what is on the road currently, and also have listened to your concerns as consumers. As dancers, ravers, b-boys, etc. ourselves, we know how to have a good time, and we wish to share our PLUR with the world, and first and foremost, YOU! <br /><br />Who we are:<br />A mish-mash of dancers, b-boys, party organizers, and connections. We plan to bring our brand of PLUR to SR, and with it instill the kind of values we have for our fellow human being. 100% Love and treat others in the same manner in which you would like to be treated yourself. This sounds like a simple concept, but you would be surprised how much is lost in translation. <br /><br />Our Product:<br />Our ties to the rave/dance community are long standing and without reproach. Rest assured any offering we post will be reagent tested and minimum 87% or higher content of MDMA or MDA, the other &quot;filler&quot; is non-harmful binding agents (mostly gelatin based) that make the pill hold its solidity. Why? because we like to roll too, and we only accept the best. We don&#039;t do powder, only stamped pills, but we will stand behind our product 110% <br /><br />For the immediate time period, we will naturally be undercutting the other vendors, price wise, to drum up business and build our reputation. Bet on us and you will not be let down. <br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />We are more than just an E vendor in many respects. We seek to change the world and those that frequent ours by instilling our values of non-violence, voluntary exchange, and mutual respect for one another. <br /><br />We will be taking on the vendor name Avicii in the coming weeks (I know, how original right?) and eagerly await our interactions with you. <br /><br />Much Love, <br /><br />Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, <br /><br />Avicii <br /><br />:

				Greetings Guys (or gals, as the case may be) <br /><br />You will have to forgive me in that I choose not to disclose manufacture and/or synthesis techniques in a public setting. <br /><br />Though, I will say this (full disclosure), that I am am not the best person within my organization to be having this discussion with. <br /><br />I will relay your question to him/her though, and if a response if forthcoming I will post it here. <br /><br />Thanks, <br /><br />Avicci

				True, <br /><br />There is always interest to some degree, no matter the location. I was just trying, via my introduction, to build some common ground with my potential customers. <br /><br />This might sound cliche, but I do genuinely care about people, and I plan to type an entire section on safety to that end. The last thing I want in a million years is to see a person hurt. <br /><br />The truth is, MDMA can be used safety if people are armed with knowledge and not government propaganda. <br /><br />Thus far anyway, The Obama administration has not managed to enslave my people, and I would like to keep it that way. Socialists, self described liberals, and Obama kiss asses I always keep my eye on though. <br /><br />I want to liberate my people, not enslave them to the system.
