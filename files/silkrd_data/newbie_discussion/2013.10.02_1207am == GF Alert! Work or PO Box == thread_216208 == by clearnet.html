				I am a long-time lurker of SR and forums but due to the convenience of a RL catch-all hookup I&#039;ve never placed an order, and thought I may never have to. This has all changed since my dealer got busted and is going away for quite some time. Unfortunately I live in a new city I moved to for work and this was my only connect. Enter dilemma:<br /><br />I have a live-in GF who is very drug-naive which translates to it&#039;s easier to not tell her I occasionally get high then to try and de-brainwash her into acceptance. She opens all of our mail, not because she&#039;s snoopy (but she is), but because I never anticipated getting drugs in the mail and tell her to open everything for me out of convenience (I work, she stays at home, pays bills, etc). It would definitely arouse suspicion for me to tell her to stop opening my mail, and she would probably think I was cheating and receiving love letters from Russian hookers or something. So home delivery is not an option.<br /><br />The only two options I can think of are work or a PO Box. People do occasionally get mail/packages sent to work now and then so that would work, assuming the stealth is more discretion-oriented as opposed to decoy (I&#039;m imagining a large box that says &quot;Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pump&quot; on the side).<br /><br />Am I just being paranoid for thinking this? Does it depend on the vendor? Should I contact the vendor and ask them before I make the purchase? Is the only safe bet PO Box and this concern is warranted? Let me know what you guys think based on experience please.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I for my self wouldn&#039;t recommend your working place. If something goes wrong, wether it is stealth or LE I am pretty sure you don&#039;t want it to get known to your boss. So in your case a PO Box sounds like the better solution.<br />Just my thoughts on it.<br />&nbsp;

				I agree with IDoNotLikeProhibition.<br /><br />If you get busted at a PO box, you&#039;re in trouble with the law, and probably also the girlfriend.<br /><br />If you get busted at work, you&#039;re in trouble with the law, you probably lose your job, and your unemployed ass is definitely getting the stink eye from across the couch.<br /><br />Cheers<br />lola
