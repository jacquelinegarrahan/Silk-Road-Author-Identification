				I posted this already, but I think it also deserves its own thread to show everyone how cool this guy is:<br /><br />Well guys, today was the day that the package arrived.<br /><br />DrugsForYou is a seriously cool dude. The product was amazing, what more can I say! Smoked the fuckin&#039; crack right in my bed when the Mrs. brought the post up to me after the postie came!<br /><br />Throughout the deal DrugsForYou provided amazing communication and did not mention FE at all! Delivery took a little longer than expected but I think that was due to the British bank holiday that we have just had here. I do not have any complaints at all about this seller.<br /><br />Being a first time buyer on here, this has really boosted my confidence and I must say that it is sellers like this that will either make or break the SR market. No point in scamming cause you can make so much more money by doing proper business, and this guy has shown that and then some!!!<br /><br />I noticed some people gave him 1/5 (2 to be precise) and were complaining about his crack product. Like I said in my feedback, the colour was not quite what I expected, but hey, colour does not a product make! The stuff was FUCKING AMAZING, I absolutely loved it. Them Dutch boys know their shit when it comes to drugs.<br /><br />The stealth was on a good level. Bubble envelope with heat sealed package inside with the wrap inside of that. Top notch. Rock was a bit broken up, but fuck me, what do you expect to happen to it when it goes through those auto sorting machines? :P<br /><br />Anyway, the long and short of it is that this new vendor on Sr deserves respect for various reasons: no pressure, no mention of dreaded FE, excellent comms, top quality product!!! If anyone else is looking for the same product as me I would highly recommend DrugsForYou due to the reasons I have already stated, you can&#039;t say fairer than that!<br /><br />Comms is a big thing when dealing in this fashion, and DrugsForYou always got back to me when I messaged him, and he did so in a no nonsense fashion. For example, yesterday I told him nothing had arrived and he just told me to keep him informed, whereas I&#039;m sure some vendors would probably think I was on the blag....<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there is anything more to say, but if anyone has anything they want to ask me about this transaction, please go ahead and ask me.<br /><br />BTW, here is the feedback I left him:<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rating&nbsp; &nbsp;review&nbsp; &nbsp;freshness&nbsp; &nbsp;item<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; OMG just got the crack and smoked it the minute I got it. FUCKIN AMAZIN... Whoever the hater was that gave 1/5 was talkin shit. The colour was not what I expected but the product was amazing. The 1/5 people prob went on the colour alone cause they&#039;re newfags. Stealth was OK, delivery in 7 days, but this due to bank holiday weekend in UK. Top stuff, top seller, amazing communication. USE THIS GUY. If he scams, he&#039;s gonna fuck himself cause he can make SOOO much money doin it proper like this. THANKS DFY AAAAAAAAA+++++++++&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 hours&nbsp; &nbsp; item<br /><br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e61438bc14<br /><br />I look forward to hearing your replies...

				I am new user and this my second account on the forum. The first one I messed up by forgetting my password and the password to my tormail.org account.<br /><br />But again back to the topic. About DrugsForYou. I also placed an order with him. The communication was very nice since we are both dutch citizens. So we communicated in dutch. I placed my order during the time of DOS attacks. And I both my bitcoins at a very high rate. But any way. But I could still find a window to place my order and then the exchange rate went down. We had lovely conversation about stuff and the order and about he&#039;s bad feed back. He assured me that we just people wanting more free drugs. The he did ask me to FE since we had such nice communitection I did and assured me that I would not be disepointed.<br />He sad he mailed to stuff monday and since this is domestic shipping I should have had it a day later. Now it have been to day later.<br />Today I have mail him have yet to receive a reply. I have decided to wait to till to more before taking action. Does any one have any advice about what kind of action a can and should take?<br /><br />BTW I use an other name for my buyers account.<br />

				PS.<br />He asked my to FE so that we could build trust. And he also offer delivery for large quantities. So that why I FE&#039;ed.<br />Because I like trust between people. You to have a solid so to guy. I think is better then going all over the place.<br />And the street in my dutch city are just really bad. Much less users so much less trust worthy dealers. In the best there were Moroccans and Turkish guys selling. Now is guys for the Antilles and they are know to be scammers and most of them have now honor. One time they sell you good stuff the next time the scam you. I have not been on the streets for almost 5 years now and thing have changed a lot. The LE really cracked down on the dealers and users. And I lost all my old connections. Every thing went underground I guess.<br />

				Well firstly you SHOULD NOT FE EARLY!!<br /><br />This is for everybody&#039;s protection. Not sayin you are but what if you are scamming the seller by FE&#039;ing early, as his only customer to do so, and then claiming a 50% refund? It&#039;s possible, but anyway, I digress...<br /><br />I would give him a couple more days if I were you as it took 7 for me and there has been May day bank holiday in UK which I may think affects other parts of EU too seeing as it is an &quot;anarchist&quot; event too. I would be surprised if it does not turn up.<br /><br />But if it doesn&#039;t I hope that DrugsForYou deals with you courteously and justly and that you get a FAIR outcome for everybody involved, because if he doesn&#039;t, people are watching and he knows it so it is in his best interests to do so, as it will have an effect on his sales. I for one would reconsider any future deals with him if there were a negative outcome.<br /><br />Also he is new and looking to build a rep so I don&#039;t think he will mess you around.<br /><br />Hopefully this will all ring true unless a large amount of dough is involved.<br /><br />All the best to you my friend, and don&#039;t FE again, an everyone else should listen to that advice too as it can be damaging for both parties as can be seen above.<br /><br />Britfag

				Thank for your support friend. I definitely will never FE with large orders. But since he did offer to deliver I will try to work something out. Like him delivering it and buy some extra stuff to make it worth his time/effort/possible risk. the Netherlands is a small country and although we live in different city they are relatively close. <br /><br />Still I wonder it is domestic shipping. I dont think that there is a big chance for interception. What do you think about that option.<br /><br />I will keep you all updated on the outcome

				Well I do not see what action you can take because yu have FE&#039;d, other than accusing him of scamming here on the forums. However, you should be careful what you accuse him of as you would be his FIRST case of non-delivery.<br /><br />Before you take ANY action, please exhaust all other possible avenues of resolution. Your package may have been lost, or he may have simply dispatched it late as you mention he needed FE to reload his stocks.<br /><br />You say you have messaged him but not received a reply. I have also sent him a message and it has not been read yet so he probably has not been online as in my experience he always reads his messages but only seems to do so ONCE A DAY and at night time so you might have to wait until tonight to get a reply.<br /><br />If and when the message I have sent him becomes flagged as READ I will post and let you know so you can work out what he is doing, and what you are going to do. Just don&#039;t start shouting scammer just yet, give the guy a chance. I myself am pretty confident that things will work out OK for you. I am sure that he knows A LOT of people will be monitoring this thread on the forums with him being a fairly new vendor, so it&#039;s in his interests to bring this to a positive closure.<br /><br />Please remember though, that you have put yourself in this position by FE&#039;ing early. I had to wait a full week for my package to arrive but I was safe in the knowledge that my money was in escrow and that I would have the fallback of the resolution centre if things were to go awry.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this all works out well for everyone involved.

				I was not planning on yelling high and low that he is a scammer. And he did come off as trustworthy. I am just a little worried. He asked me to FE you we could build trust. And honesty, trust, justice and such are the morals I live by. And if those values are in any way violated it makes my blood boil.<br />So if ever somebody scammed my after talking about trust I would not care much about the money such about those values. <br /><br />Yes its true most messages I got from him were send late at night. And I appreciate if you keep me updated on your communication with him. <br /><br />I just hope that he will be honest with me about the reason for the delay. I am quite easy going on some matters as long as people are honest and are doing there best. <br /><br />And the chances for it being lost are quite small because the TPG the dutch mail service has a 100 percent delivery rate. And it being late is something like 84 percent.<br /><br />I guess I have to be more patient. And the later the package arrives is actually better. Build up the excitement and will make the use of it even better. <br /><br />So you mean to say that if I FE. There is no resolution options?

				Oke Thank you very much. For explaining that to me.<br />I guess I will never FE again. <br /><br />My message are unread to. I did send him an encrypted message.<br /><br />On his vendor page he does promise reship if the goods do not arrive. <br /><br />Lets say I never receive the goods and also do not receive the reship. Can I then report him?<br />&nbsp;<br />And lets say he never replies to my message or at least not in a way is satisfying. Can I then report him.<br /><br />And if I report him what action will the SR staff be able to take.<br /><br />Thank you
