				Hey everyone,<br /><br />Quick question. If I ordered a package on a Saturday (small letter size shipped same day) via express mail in US when should I expect it?&nbsp; At apartments do they bring it to the door, leave it at the door, put it in my mail box, or leave it in the office with staff?<br /><br />Thanks for the info

				Depends on your mailman and apartment...usually express because they have to have it there&nbsp; by 12 or 3 they bring to you..no matter if its apartment or not..<br />And the express mail person is a separate one. I talked to one around they work just from 12-3 doing just that, express mail..so do not worry that it isn&#039;t the regular mailman

				Thanks Purple. Will they knock on my door or just leave it on the mat? Should I answer or just let em lay it on the ground? Don&#039;t want them to just walk away with it either.

				Depends if it actually got shipped saturday or this morning...express is a 1-2 day event after put in transit so it depends what time of the day and which day the vendor actually got it into circulation.<br /><br />As far as the delivery it&#039;s usual in with your daily mail unless it arrives after your mail went out in the daily mail then a special delivery will happen some times as late as 530pm on that day. it is very rare for the post office to hold it and make you pick it up...they might hold it til the next mail day but they are pretty good on getting an express package to you in an express period of time...even recently i believed the delivery times have been improved in many area as of this summer. Depends on the local po in your town, if they take pride in their jobs or not. Some places even get express may delivered on Sundays.

				It was shipped on Saturday. My regular mailman usually doesn&#039;t come until 530p so I was wandering if someone will bring it earlier to coincide with their 3pm gurantee?

				&nbsp;My regular mailman usually doesn&#039;t come until 530p so I was wandering if someone will bring it earlier to coincide with their 3pm gurantee?<br /><br />Yep..that&#039;s what I was saying earlier..Express mail in town is delivered by a man or a woman in a vehicle with a magnet that says express mail on their door..We are in a by 3 area, and usually they show between 12-1. <br /><br />I talked to them the other day and they literally only do the express mail from 12 (truck arrives here then)to when done ..and that is it..its a 3 hr a day job.

				This sounds awesome, but I feel like the mailmen around here don&#039;t give a shit. Regardless they have 45 minutes until their guarantee is worth shit. I just want my package, but they just take their sweet time.

				I&#039;m the opposite. Live in a bigger city, and now the &quot;express&quot; mail is a half hour late. It will probably come with the usual 5:30 mail. Bastards.

I would guess that if it fits, they very well might just put it in your mail box. It&#039;s guaranteed delivered by 3PM, not guaranteed to be in your hands . They mark the delivery time down anyway to cover their asses . Mine almost always are left in my mailbox .

				Well it was marked in transit around 10:20 Saturday, shipped shortly after, now its 620pm Monday and still no &quot;2 day express&quot; delivery. Guess I shouldn&#039;t worry it just pisses me off. Why pay the premium for the turn around time if they can&#039;t do it? At least I&#039;m off tomorrow too. I just hate waiting for the damn postman. To make things worse the vendor is quiet and hasn&#039;t &quot;been seen&quot; for almost two days so no tracking or anything.

				Alright figured some stuff out after speaking with the vendor. It was dropped off when indicated-Saturday. The post did not scan and accept until yesterday. That is when they started to move it. I am watching the tracking and it has moved quickly and is at local PO. It says guaranteed today by 3. So hopefully yesterdays prediction will hold true and someone besides my regular slow ass 6pm mail lady will bring it. Today is my last day off for awhile and I want my package. Thanks for all the responses. Only if the mail ppl did what they get paid for maybe they wouldn&#039;t be in such financial trouble. Who knows?

Put it in the mailbox (sometimes bending it to make it fit) OR 2. Leave it in the office. They only knock on my door if it is something I need to sign for, but if they knocked on my door for a SR order, I would ignore it and let them leave it in the office or mailbox so you know your safe.

				Yea it will be there before 3. <br /><br />hopefully your express person is like ours and its there between 12-1..<br /><br />This whole worry about signing thing is up to you personally, but if the vendor doesnt check the leave without sig box it has to be signed for..I get ebay,amazon,walmart, and other packages, I have always signed if I needed to, I want my damn package. Do not freak out automatically, there have been more then a few instances where people have had to sign and they did not then suddenly get thrown down and arrested..Its something that is hotly debated on the forum, and frankly it ends up being a personal choice.<br /><br />Mail person here, knocks I answer, haven&#039;t needed to sign recently, but once I answer I am certainly not going to say uh no I wont sign and look completely suspicious..
