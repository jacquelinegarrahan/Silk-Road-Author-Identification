				I haven&#039;t been able to access for 2 days now, it looks like it&#039;s overloaded.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a little surprised they don&#039;t have a donation link, it might help them upgrade their infrastructure a bit..

Their help page explains how to set up Thunderbird to work with tormail. If you were doing that, you wouldn&#039;t be able to send anything with them down of course, but at least you&#039;d have a local copy of your mail that you could access. Though depending on your level of paranoia / security hazard, you may not want to do this on a machine that LE may one day get their hands on without having everything heavily encrypted.
