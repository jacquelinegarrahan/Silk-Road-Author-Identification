				Has anyone received any communication from this vendor other than for them to FE? Hasn&#039;t replied to messages inquiring about order, seems to be asking everyone to FE. Anyone received any goods from them in the last week?

				So after 11 days, domestic, my product finally arrived from this vendor, comms were poor but i presume they are dealing with a large number of orders. Product is of good quality, fair play that they did send it in the end.

				I made an order with yingyang about 2 days ago for 100 valium. I saw that FE was needed but I have ordered from him before, it was a while ago, it took a while but eventually turned up. So I just ordered without checking into him thoroughly. After I made the order I started looking. I regretted making the order. Luckily I hadnt finalized early but just made the order. I messaged the vendor and asked if I could have it cancelled coz I didnt want to FE anymore but reading these posts make me think my message wont have been read and he does have a lot of orders. So now I think it will no doubt stay in escrow for the full 17 days before I get the chance to get my money back. I wrote in the message if you send the tablets and let me stay in escrow, like if they turn up I will finalize but if he doesnt read it then that wont matter.<br /><br />He stopped selling about 7-8 days days ago with a couple of reviews which looked bad, then there are many orders made starting from 3 days ago, all have FE&#039;d and not one of them has updated to say it arrived, not 1. So I think this is one of those selective scamming things. Used to be an ok vendor but now is just doing the old rip and run with every ones early finalization. Hopefully if its a scam when SR shut him down they might give me all my money back.<br /><br />I dont want to say that this vendor is a scammer coz I have no proof or anything and like I say Ive used him before and he sorted me out relatively easily. Im just saying what has happened to me so far. Should they arrive suddenly I will update this post and finalize.<br /><br />I dont lie when I make reviews I try to be honest, there is nothing to gain other than giving something back to the SR community who have helped me the same way through my time here and all my orders. <br /><br />Any one else with any issues or who knows anything I would appreciate you letting me know.

				I&#039;ve personally have not dealt with this vendor. As for the FE, you&#039;re only setting yourself up to get ripped off or scammed. Don&#039;t FE, there is too much at stake after you FE. Vendor could drop dead, get arrested, or just plain not mail it out just for spite! Stay in escrow, it&#039;s there for your protection.
