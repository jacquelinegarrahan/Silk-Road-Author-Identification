				&nbsp;I&#039;m going to stake my growing reputation on this advice. I&#039;ve placed an initial order with this vendor to support my conclusions... money is no problem for me and I&#039;m confident that they aren&#039;t going to ship anything so I&#039;m not particularly concerned about their technique. Further, I&#039;m using a drop that I don&#039;t care about and that can&#039;t trace to me.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now, here are some reasons you SHOULD NOT order from MM:<br /><br />1. Mendicino is actually spellt Mendocino. No local would make this mistake.<br />2. The forum presence for MendicinoMistress kicks up a few days ago, right about the time her listings first started appearing. What do you think of a vendor who acquires over 200 feedback, all positive, without having public listings? (scammer)<br />2. When I placed my order I was messaged 36 seconds later. MM informed me that they would scale my product, package it, print labels, and transfer it to outgoing mail.... then she would mark it &quot;in transit&quot; so I could FE. The pack was marked in transit within 60 seconds of the message.<br />3. I messaged MM back and asked how they packaged so quickly, 14hrs later and that message has no reply.<br />4. A few days after MM&#039;s listings went public, about the time you might expect the first wave of packs to arrive.... MM&#039;s feedback begins to plummet. Its still well padded with vague 5/5 and FE 5/5 (stupid fucking noobs dont rate 5/5 when FE).... but it definitely appears to be taking a hit from the legitimate orders among the bunch.<br /><br />5. MM has tens of thousands in FE status with no touchdowns. There is no reason to think this vendor can handle the volume. There is no reason for this vendor to require FE when turnover is so powerful.<br />6. MendicinoMistress is selling product significantly below market equilibrium. A real businessman doesn&#039;t undercut the market when growth is already exponential.<br />7. MM has such a wide variety of listings that we would assume &quot;she&quot; is representing a well established operation... but again, we have no information and no particular signs of professionalism.... mostly just product hot words and listings that are key&#039;d in for the highest market demand.<br /><br />Damn, I could go on and on.... especially in terms of economic in-congruence.<br /><br /><br />But please, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD..... NEWBIES..... DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR.<br /><br />8. You can afford to wait a week to order and in one week you&#039;ll have conclusive information about the nature of this vendor. The forums will be littered with disappointment from packs not received. <br />9. MM could easily be LE. I see many newbies asking &quot;how can LE sell over SR?&quot; and I see the debates that follow.... many people quick to point out that LE can break their own laws.... a few people who recognize that LE is not inclined to break their own laws... and now I&#039;m adding my two sense: LE can fake feedback and honeypot your asses with well priced bulk listings in a domestic setting; without ever risking the public backlash of providing drugs and overdosing users.<br /><br />I could keep going but I&#039;ll stop for now. DONT FUCKING ORDER.<br /><br />I love you guys so damn much.

				My conversation with&nbsp; the Mistress confirmed my BS meter. <br /><br />Clearly they are not growing the same strains&nbsp; &nbsp;outdoors, in a green house, and indoors.&nbsp; <br /><br />The stupid bitch told me,&nbsp; &nbsp; U can order any strain you want in any quality you want. <br /><br /><br />Dumbass Hoe!!
