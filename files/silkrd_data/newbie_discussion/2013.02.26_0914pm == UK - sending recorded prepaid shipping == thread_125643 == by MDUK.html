				I&#039;m looking to set up here as a vendor in the next couple of weeks (trying to make sure I&#039;ve got this whole thing properly understood before I start selling) and I&#039;m looking for the best methods for sending UK&gt;UK.<br /><br />Obviously there&#039;s standard 1st class and 2nd class mail, but I wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable offering a significant refund in the event of non-delivery of untracked mail. Maybe with a copy of the seizure letter in the event that something&#039;s been intercepted, but otherwise there&#039;s no way to tell whether the buyer&#039;s being honest with you or not.<br /><br />So, I&#039;ve been looking to see whether it&#039;s practical to offer recorded delivery to those who have the option of getting mail dropped somewhere it can be signed for and offering a full refund in the event of non-delivery on that. Does anyone know whether the prepaid postage you can do with a royal mail online account (which I can obviously use with a prepaid CC and a throwaway phone) requires you to take a package to the post office, or whether you can just drop it in a post box somewhere quiet?<br /><br />I&#039;ll be shipping MDMA capsules, and I&#039;ve sent these via royal mail before plenty of times outside SR so my stealth is pretty well sorted, but only to people I know who aren&#039;t going to claim nothing showed up and demand a refund ;)<br /><br />(I&#039;ll post this again in the shipping forum when I have my 50 posts, but I figure I might find someone with the right info here anyway).<br /><br />Will also be interested in getting someone to critique my product &amp; packaging next week or maybe the week after, so freebies will be given out then ;D
