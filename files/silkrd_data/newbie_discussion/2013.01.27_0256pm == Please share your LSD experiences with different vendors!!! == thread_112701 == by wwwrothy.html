				I personally was ripped off by EntertheMatrix when I first joined. Just a kid in a candy store seeing 5 tabs at 350ug!!! They were sorted by best selling, I had no idea what an FE was, but since he was so nice helpful, I turned over $100+ for 5 hits of what I thought, would be the most amazing 24 trip ever. It was a dud. <br /><br />Since, I&#039;ve been off lsd vendors and got into the 25x nbome series (which can be amazing) and also found a couple real cool US vendors from things like MXE and shrooms.<br /><br />Then I started in the threads. Talked to the Avengers, but this was all after I lost my job and after i made my massive fourth order.<br /><br />Looks like Tessellated had the goods. I missed that bus. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got a tab(s) coming now that could be what I experienced so long ago and had gotten nothing but bunk off the street since.<br /><br />Does anyone have any great experiences with lsd from other vendors that can be trusted with product?<br /><br />I have $$ coming in and i&#039;m not giving up on that experience I had with just one tab over 15 years ago; 6+ strong of nonstop visuals, nonstop smile, and music has yet to sound as amazing on any type of drug. I almost started to think my &quot;lsd receptor&quot; was damaged. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that is impossible.<br /><br />So for you pure and true LSD searchers, let me know what your experiences have been and maybe, together we&#039;ll never waste a bitcoin again!<br /><br />roth

				Hey roth,<br />Like you I had always been into LSD. When I got onto the road my first purchase was some tabs of 25c-nbome from a US vendor called HardHustle, and all went down well. I really enjoy all the nbome chemicals, and that first purchase led me to buying LSD off the road too. I picked up two 200ug tabs from a UK vendor called Dr Greenfingers and all was good, the tabs were fine. Since then I haven&#039;t purchased any more from either of these vendors as I have been varying my drug use, and in doing so received some great powdered psilocybe cubensis mushrooms from a Canadian vendor called Foxcave.<br />All in all, I&#039;ve never been scammed or not received a product I have ordered, because I ordered from reliable vendors. Just look through the seller&#039;s feedback on the road and their thread on the forum before ordering anything, hopefully that should get you what you want ;)<br />- JH

				I&#039;ve made three orders now with Tessellated and just like the forums say, he&#039;s legit.&nbsp; No FE requirements (never, ever FE), he answered all of my questions promptly and with ENCRYPTION -- can&#039;t understate how important that is to me; he&#039;s no fool -- and each shipment arrived in less than a week very cleverly packaged.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dropped two tabs yesterday and it was easily the best LSD experience of my life.&nbsp; 1 tab didn&#039;t quite do it a week ago, but yesterday, 30 minutes after I dropped the second one things got very interesting very fast.&nbsp; No hangover, no issues sleeping, and I feel better than ever today.&nbsp; And WOW!&nbsp; the body sensation were like MDMA x 10; for a second there I was worried :o<br /><br />Highly recommended, apparently trustworthy vendor.&nbsp; And he just got more in!

				My experience was with FartBomber and it was my first time trying lsd and I must say he was a very nice seller very friendly on shipping the lsd and packaging even though you don&#039;t need much stealth with lsd, I had a nice body high nothing much since i didn&#039;t plan on getting visuals right at hand since it was on the dosage high i was expecting so now I&#039;m ordering like 100+ug to try to get a mid trip then after some visuals I&#039;m going to increase the amount i take.<br /><br />His lsd is lab tested so you are sure he&#039;s talking real about dosages.

My mate who has tripped 100+ times said I got lucky, that it was the cleanest, best acid he&#039;d ever had in his life. Anyway I took two hits each time and had intense visuals and amazing spiritual, life changing experiences. My first trip I saw an entire green grass field purple, even the white mushrooms on it were purple tinted. The sky was flashing different colours every second, transitioning seamlessly between each colour change. The stars became extra bright and 2-3 times their actual size. At one point everything became pixelated like I was in some retro video game or something, lol. All this off two hits of acid. Is this pretty standard? If LucyDrop&#039;s batch isn&#039;t as strong, how many do you suppose I should take?

				Yea it seems Tess has what i want right now. what i dont have is the cash, waiting for a couple checks which may take 2 weeks. Just keeping my fingers crossed that it all stays the same. I&#039;m equally happy ordering with LucyDrop also.<br /><br />Ive got Plur sending me two liquid tabs and i&#039;ll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />And a sketchy (according to Avengers) vendor from France sending me tab(s) with a tracking number which could be here in a few days.<br /><br />Got a sample from GoodForNothin and felt nothing. <br /><br />Which again makes me paranoid that LSD might NOT be able to effect me anymore!!! I really think this people. All dissociatives work fine, nbome is great, but is a high tolerance builder.<br /><br />Please tell me that ive just been getting bunk &quot;lsd&quot; off the streets off and on through the years since my first truly amazing one tab experience. I need that back badly bc it was heaven on earth. <br /><br />I mean with each weak, very weak, or fake blotter i try, the more i think that maybe i tripped on DXM too many times and it messed up my brain. But 25x-nbome definitely works so there is hope right?<br /><br />Help me people. Set my mind right that I can enjoy real LSD again.<br /><br />THANKS!!<br /><br />Roth

				Looking to have some experience with an acid vendor, Lucydrop, in a little over a week. Heard some good things about the guy, prices for LSD seem to be the BEST I can find on SR so far, and his claimed 100 ug per hit seem a lot more believable that other vendors that claim 200-300 ug. I guess we&#039;ll see.<br /><br />If I&#039;m still around the newbie threads by then, I&#039;ll let you know how that goes!

				It was lots of DXM waaaay back in the day. but &#039;m just being paranoid. I just havent gotten real lsd in a loooong time. Actually the introduction the 25-nbome series I think proved my paranoid theory wrong. I had serious elated mood (almost as much as i remember from the real lsd so long ago) i had crazy fun visuals, totally tripped out mental, i was for lack of a better term, tripping my balls off. 25c at high(er) doses is like a crazy candy flip, while 25i can produce more mental and CEV&#039;s that are mindblowing. Both had intense euphoria and visuals, Once, though, taking too much 25i produce a very unwanted a very quick unset right to the peak before i knew wtf was up. Then, unwanted auditory hallucinations happened. It was just too much. That chemical taken recreationally can be fun as hell and DEEP (no matter what people say).<br /><br />So that right there I believe proves I can surely handle LSD in all its glory. <br /><br />With all my bumps in the road, this has now become an obsession to score quality in quantity. It&#039;s available right now, and if i had the cash in hand i&#039;d chill.<br /><br />ANOTHER QUICK QUESTION:: When you guys make you deposits wherever (Wal-mart, 7-11, Target, where the site sends you), do you have the deposit sent right to your SR account or do you use an online bitwallet (with take more % off) to be super extra careful? I&#039;ve always used a bitwallet, but im thinking its pointless and im losing more money the more i put in there. <br /><br />THANKS

				Hey, looking to buy some LSD, I&#039;ve only had it once before. From Envious, took 2 had a mild but fun time.<br />I and a friend are looking to get some more and we want to trip a bit harder.<br />I have enough money to buy either a 5 strip from Tessellated or a 10 strip from Lucydrop.<br />Ive heard of Lucydrop&#039;s stuff being seized and he is weird about FE&#039;ing, however I&#039;ve heard that Tessellated&#039;s stuff isnt known to be quite the 200ug he list it at. I&#039;ve heard people say that 2 blotters of his stuff blasted them off, others say it&#039;s probably less than 100ug. (my last blotters, from envious, were sold as 100ug but were almost definitely around 65ug).<br /><br />Suggestions? Who would you guys go with,?

				Well, due to my massive, OCD/adderall induced, forum-searching, posting, LSD Avengers reading, talking to THEM, L vendors, customers, and about everything else I can help you with this&#039;<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about LucyDrop&#039;s FE. Her rep is flawless. And her tabs are 100ug and thats why ther price for 25 hits is the same as Tessellated&#039;s 10 hits.<br /><br />Tessellated&#039;s hits are 200+, they are blowing people&#039;s minds. I&#039;m going to buy from him if he has the same batch in 2 weeks, hell, maybe LucyDrop. I could make some $$ with asshole around hwere i love with extra hits of white fluff LSD and 25 hits would be nice.<br /><br />Also, there are a handful of other vendors that pop uo with batches that are just as good, or better, just a matter of time.<br /><br />Have you checked out the LSD Avenger page? Those guys are pretty honest. They stuck the EntertheMatrix crew in the BAD Vendors section, which destroys business, where they deserve to be. Man, did they rip me off.<br /><br />here are the Avengers: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=45270.0<br /><br />Let me know about the tabs!<br /><br />

				If you take the time to follow the 3jane thread on the forums, and/or 3jane&#039;s profile, you will learn in advance of a specific date and time that 3jane will next be selling L. 3jane starts listing like clockwork at exactly the promised date/time, so long as SR is up. If you want to get in on it, you really have to be camping out on it, because he/she typically sells out in 30-60 minutes. But it is WELL WORTH IT. 3jane has mad consistency and their stuff is clearly laid from some fucking clean crystal.... fantastic.<br />

				my 2 hits from Tessellated were definitely close to being 200 ug each and most assuredly a lot stronger then 100 ug. But look at the new guy doc morris I been wanting to try him and he is giving two hits away if you buy a half gram of his coke and they are 160 ug each as stated so maybe he has some for sale as well

				lol so okay, Walkaboot&#039;s four tabs of weird shit, since they took 2 hours to feel anything, there was def a muscimol or mesc type slow moving thing. There was SOMTHING there though, I had to work and stare at this for any movement. there was movement though and music sounded amazing. tiny little tracers. <br /><br />and i take a low dose of suboxone daily which poses no problem with establish chemicals from established people. all except LSD, which i havent put real money into a real vendor yet

				My first purchase was with 3jane about 6 months ago and I&#039;m still trying to figure out if I&#039;m taking acid...I was like the OP originally(kid in the candy store type deal) and didn&#039;t really know shit about the inconsistency with the lsd market.

				I&#039;ve had nothing but good experiences with Albionessentials and Jesus of Rave. They&#039;ve both been a pleasure to order from and their product&#039;s been great. I was once a little troubled by the bitter taste of the Shivas Albion had, but with a quick trip to the Avengers and LSD thread, all my concerns were laid to rest.<br /><br />Oh, and as Trippylizard said, tripping too often will have you fighting tolerence. Next day will need 200% the amount to feel the same thing as baseline, one week will need 150% (give or take).

				Hi,<br /><br />I tried LSD that i ordered of a vendor called 4sale (UK). I took 2 (150ug blotters) and me and the friends i took them with had very intense giggles and then i had some very deep thinking for the remainder of the trip. No visuals at all. the blotters where tasteless until about 5 minutes in when they tasted a bit bitter but i am aware this could have been the ink. They are not like any LSD i have had in the past.<br /><br />I have now ordered from Tessellated and hope these are going to be the trips for me!! very much looking foward to it as i have heard a lot of good things about this vendor!

				Tripped on VitaCats Maya Calendars, awesome LSD. a biiit less strong then the dalai lamas i had, at least the blotters i got. great, fluid visuals, very organic feel to it, and the hole trip. generally very clean acid, comes and goes and seems to leave no trace. beautiful and strong. 1,5 had me rolling some good 15 hours. bit pricey, though, compared to others here hell of pricey. worth a handful experiences though imo, due to its own touch that nice acid has.<br /><br />looking forward to other varieties of lsd around here, just ordered a 5-strip resell of lucydrops alpha centauris. jummy!

I&#039;m getting into some of Jerseycow&#039;s Star 150ug tabs. He&#039;s also a beat. JesusofRave also comes out with sheets, and they go quick as fuck. right now, though, LucyDrop definitely has confirmed 100ug tabs at a decent price, Tessellated tabs are 200ug for a slightly higher per mic price. Cant wait to try em out!
