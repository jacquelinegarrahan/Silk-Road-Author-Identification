				People who sell such things as software, movies, games that aren&#039;t even physical, it&#039;s just a download link. It baffles me why would somebody pay even a bitcoin for something they can get free by doing a Google search or going on a Torrent website.

				I was actually thinking about buying it.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; My GF said coppers are trained to look behind sockets too.&nbsp; Just FYI.<br /><br />To be fair.&nbsp; Most of those people selling digital stuff aren&#039;t selling it for that much.

				Porn.<br /><br />Who is buying porn for BTC? Are there seriously people on here who are technically aware enough to be able to use tor and bitcoins... but don&#039;t know how to watch porn on the internet without parting with tricky-to-acquire cryptocurrency?

				Free porn should be a god given right! On the other hand (no pun intended) I guess someone has to buy it so they keep making it... I did buy some pretty cool E-books just to get a few purchases under my belt (no pun intended again =o) but I did search PB for them first!
