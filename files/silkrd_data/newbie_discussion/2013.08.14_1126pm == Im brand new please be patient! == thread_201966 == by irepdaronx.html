				Ok so like I said i am brand new (registered yesterday) and have gotten scammed recently trying to get a good fake id. I really like the escrow system here and it has given me confidence in placing an order. I need biticoin in a hurry and the main site that was highly recommended for me in the US requires a few days and me to verify my identity. The guy I wanna buy from told me user &quot;FreeMoney&quot; is trust worthy and his feedback seems good. Is it stupid to buy biticoin on here from someone? It also lists a price can I make the purchase before I go get the moneypack? Is it wrong for me to talk about what vendors I&#039;m dealing with on this forum? Like I said please be patient I can barely calculate the exchange rates!!!!

				Have you looked into localbitcoins? This is the only way I have gotten bitcoins since BitInstant has been down. I&#039;ve used a vanilla reload card and completed 2 bank transfers but you can also trade with a moneypak, cash deposit, moneygram, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s really easy to use and has a nice escrow system in place! Usually had my coins in under an hour :)

				You can talk about anything you want on this forum, it&#039;s safe. Dealing with a vendor here could be a good or a bad idea. Just make sure they have a lot of good karma, were here for a good amount of time, and not much bad karma. Searching their name wouldn&#039;t be that bad either, but generally you could safely buy btc here. Just don&#039;t listen to all those mass spam messages.

				I&#039;d advise againt going with a bitcoin vendor on here, esp if you can find someone to meet locally on localbitcoins.&nbsp; You can use their escrow system

				Hey man the best thing to do is start with small transactions and you will slowly gain confidence buying on SR, like what was said before check a vendors stats and threads in the forums and also read through the customer reviews on the vendor page , go for a vendor thats got high positive feedback but you may get a better deal with newer vendors trying to establish themselves.<br /><br />There is a vendor i met earlier hes giving what seems to be a great rate at the moment , i cant vouch for him in any way but its maybe worth checking out he has a thread here<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201943.0<br /><br />and the vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/bd346d6f6b<br /><br />Im pretty new to this too man but ive learned alot in the short time ive been here, jus message me if u need any help<br /><br />You know how to use PGP?<br />

				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d342a4af27<br />i have had great luck with this vendor, i would say just buy 2 btc at a time. best way is vanilla reload card.<br />send the number as your address and i have got my coins in minutes.<br />start small it only costs 4.95 for the card. try 50 first.
