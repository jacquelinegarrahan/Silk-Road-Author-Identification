				I have just started here on SIlk Road and I have clicked on acount and gotten the message:<br /><br />Warning: Read this before making a deposit to your account<br /><br />Your PIN is required to make purchases, withdraw funds from your account, and make important changes to your account. If you forget your PIN, or give it away to a phishing site impersonating Silk Road, any funds you deposit to your account will be irretreivable.<br /><br />Before depositing any funds, you should change your PIN and password on your SETTINGS page. If you are unable to change them because you&#039;ve already forgotten them, you must create a new account and try again.<br /><br />Once you are ready, send your deposit to this address:<br /><br />How do I send to the address?<br />I am confused.<br /><br />Fred

				It&#039;s simple, You should &quot;change&quot; pin to make yourself sure, that You remember it.<br /><br />Then You can copy the deposit address (or You can get new one, doesn&#039;t matter) and send some money to it, from your bitcoin wallet.<br /><br />The warning about pin isn&#039;t useless, first time I realized i actually forget it, so it saved my money ;D

				It depends where you are. Go to localbitcoin.com. register. This method of getting coin you go<br />&nbsp;to bank and put money in account. look for ausbitbank. Be patient, you can follow the path of transaction thru block-chain.from 1 to 2hours until final destination, remember it has to go on a long trip to get to where you want it. i hope it helps. Like i said&nbsp; depends where you are

				you click on account in silk road - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/account<br /><br />then you&#039;ll see this<br /><br />to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address:<br />15bXSD61egdg1nKY4QGgCzug7fExt7265K&nbsp; &nbsp;get new address<br />Please be patient, it may take a few hours for the Bitcoin network to confirm the transaction.<br /><br />that long line of letters and numbers is the address you need to send your btc to. copy/paste it into the send btc area of your wallet.<br /><br />also take notice of the change pin warnings. do you know your pin? are you sure?<br /><br />if you deposit btc and then forget your pin you will not be able to recover them. again do you know your pin, not just your password but you pin as well?

				yeah you want to use localbitcoins and find a good vendor that is reliable and has good feedback...then you want to do a cash deposit at a bank.&nbsp; I have used this guy many times and it has always worked out perfectly.<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/mrbrownfuzz/<br /><br />I got the coins within minutes after the deposit, and they are bought anonymously with no ties to your ID.<br /><br />Or I think he has cash in mail options if you don&#039;t mind waiting a couple days. The rates will be lower for mailing cash on the site.<br /><br />Then, as stated above, transfer the coins to your SR wallet and do as you like with them.<br /><br />Best of luck to you.

				Want to know the best method? Get a moneypak/reloadit card from a reliable vendor and you&#039;ll have money in 24 hrs for a low fee if you do it right.<br /><br />No one knows your name or where it came from. The money just appears in your silk road account when you message the vendor.

				Buy local, in person, with cash.&nbsp; All you need is a cell phone to make the transaction.&nbsp; I like the Blockchain.info iPhone app [probably available on Android also].<br />If you are in a metropolitan area, try Craigslist.&nbsp; That&#039;s where I bought my first few coins.&nbsp; You can even post a &quot;buying BTC&quot; ad in the &quot;wanted&quot; section of CL.<br />Localbitcoins.com is ok, there are some more local sites.&nbsp; You can always try Bitcointalk.org in the currency exchange section, or sell your own [legal] stuff for BTC in the marketplace.&nbsp; Everything from food to servers in there.<br /><br />For a long-term solution, use a verified MtGox account with verified Dwolla account.&nbsp; Only $0.25 transaction fees plus 0.65% commission.&nbsp; Then just transfer your coins out of Gox to a wallet, then another wallet, then a tubmler service, and wala: laundered coins ;).<br /><br />Mr uP.

				My preferred method is localbitcoins.com. The supplier I use charges a small fee (last time it was $4 for a $60 deposit), and all you have to do is make a cash deposit into his bank account. Every time I&#039;ve done it this way, the bitcoins were in my wallet when I returned home. <br /><br />The next step, OP, is to transfer the bitcoins from your localbitcoins wallet to your SR wallet using the address found on your SR account page. This shouldn&#039;t take more than an hour.
