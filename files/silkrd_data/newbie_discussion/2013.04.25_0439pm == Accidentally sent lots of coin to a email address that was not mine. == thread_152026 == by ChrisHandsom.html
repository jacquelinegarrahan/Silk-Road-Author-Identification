				Used Bitstamp, then bitinstant zip zap money order, sending bitcoins to email. Long story short, forgot a number on my email and now all of my coin are in a email account that is not mine. <br /><br />The only good news is that i have a very unoriginal email that just has a number behind it, so its possible that the other email could be not even in use right now (if there is a god).<br /><br />Called Zip Zap, they told me to call Bitinstant. <br />They have no number listed. Tried to send them a message but they asked for the order information that was sent to the other email. <br />Is there any way I could get my money back? I doubt i could send the owner of the account a message just asking for it. I dont know much about hacking, but maybe I could hack the password? <br />I dont know. I would be very Grateful for any help with this.

				I would email the person, them email the service customer support.&nbsp; If that fails, it&#039;s not cash it&#039;s a money order.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to file a dispute, hopefully the person is somewhat human and you don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; Don&#039;t try and hack, I mean you can probably smooth talk it.&nbsp; And I would help you more if you wanted, I&#039;m very bored.

				Ive been told by bitinstant, that if you send the coin to a valid addy, but not yours, the coins are gone for ever.<br /><br />Ive made a similar mistake, but used an entirely invalid addy. They then sent me my coin. They have an email option on their site.

				Have you tried registering the email account you sent the funds to? Hopefully it sits unoccupied. Good luck.
