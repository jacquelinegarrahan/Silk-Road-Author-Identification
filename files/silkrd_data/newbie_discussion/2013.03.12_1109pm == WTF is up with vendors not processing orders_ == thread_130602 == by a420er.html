				So, I have been on SR a while and have excellent stats. I rarely post here because I don&#039;t have much to contribute but this past week has pissed me off to no end. I ordered from two different vendors this past week and neither would ship the order. I messaged one giving him all the details of the transaction, still 4 days later, no reply. The one I messaged, I have done business with in the past. <br /><br />My guess, I made purchases when BC was at ~$50/coin, now it has dropped a few dollars and they don&#039;t want to cash out at that price. They want me to cancel and reorder. Well, guess what, I fucking bought them at that price so they should fucking sell them at the price the market is at. Regardless, I will not be doing business with them again. So, if you are the vendor, and you know who you are. Chalk my business up to a loss. <br /><br />A4

				As a vendor, and a new one, all I can&nbsp; say is that processing an order is completely up to the vendor.&nbsp; My own philosophy as someone who has been in this business off the road for decades is to follow your instincts, if an order does not feel right, or anything brings doubt, it should be canceled.&nbsp; I am not saying this is the case with your issue, just offering one viewpoint on the issue.&nbsp; I would continue to talk to the vendors you do business with and not completely shut the door, there is no telling what circumstances could be playing a role there.&nbsp;

				I am appreciate the comment pk. I can accept the fact that shit goes awry from time to time. That is the nature of the business. I just needed to blow off some steam. Regardless, I refuse to do business with anyone that doesn&#039;t feel a need to message a buyer and let them know the milk has gone sour and it will be a few days. That being said, I won&#039;t do business with either again. A vendor that appreciates a paying, non-scamming customer will pick up my business.

				Just be patients. It can be ea multiple of things. The vendor has one to many orders and is just slammed. Has some real world shit that came up. or the vendor is dry and just waiting to re-up, could of even ran out of supplies and just waiting on them to be delivered. Just be patient and some vendors will make up for it.
