				Personally im looking for bulk ketamine at a decent price but often order small amounts of tasty hash (ReD EyE has nice charas by the way)<br />Also im always keeping an eye out for decent priced acid and other psychedelics.<br /><br />What I do like to see is new vendors trying to make SR even better with quality goods and service, seems with your question thats exactly your agenda too :)<br /><br />Welcome and may your time here be fruitful ! Kalli.

				I&#039;m a new buyer and I have to say the sheer volume of great offerings on here is almost overwhelming. What I&#039;ve been looking for though is good reviews of stealth (Need to use proper equipment, mylar/mbb bags etc. and avoid contaminants) and quality combined with price. I know that seems obvious but I am surprised at what seems like a lack of truly competitive pricing on the road. Some things are cheap as dirt and others seem high. I&#039;d wager that if you could vend somewhere in the middle so that you had competitive prices but were beating the markups you&#039;d quickly earn a good reputation and alot of business. Quantity is another thing I look for, because I can see myself sometimes wanting to splurge but most of the time I just want something in enough of a quantity to last me a few times and then move on. If you could offer a wide selection of quantities I&#039;m sure you&#039;d win some fans. Other than that, I just look for fast response times if possible and PGP or some type of encryption for sure.

				Where will you be shipping to?&nbsp; Personally I&#039;m looking for Subutex 2mg (or generic), I can only find Suboxone/Subutex 8mg.... at outrageous prices.

				Packaging information ! Nothing that could help LEO identifying your packages but a little mention of the stealth of the packaging technique you&#039;re using !

				I would like guaranteed shipping next business day, and guaranteed to respond to messages within 24 hours.&nbsp; Also, I would like to see vendors state that FE is never required under any circumstances.&nbsp;

				Awesome responses!<br />We personally are only doing local weed in Australia (aussie&#039;s message us on SR for a free sample if you haven&#039;t already!)<br /><br />After reading your responses I&#039;m going to go change some stuff on our Vendor page. Point out that we aren&#039;t asking for FE and some other things.<br />I hope we&#039;re not the only Vendor to benefit from your opinions :)<br /><br />Green Inc
