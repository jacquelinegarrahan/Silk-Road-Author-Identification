				i used to love trying new research chemicals, ive done quite a few and my personal favorites are 2cb and 4 aco dmt<br />ive also tried afew that were very similar to mdma and meth but i dont remember what they were besides mephedrone<br />but the problem with them is that there so god damn cheap sometimes its easy to over do it because you have so much<br />and when trying new ones remember that sometimes they dont do much, taking a bunch more is not a good idea<br />

				i had my first experience with 2cb this past summer, it was a great trip! i dont know how much of the &quot;acid&quot; i have previously eaten was actually RC&#039;s but they all seemed rather similar to me especially in comparison to shrooms

It&#039;s cheap so when you have a large volume on your shelf, you need to have some self-discipline. <br />Still I think Mephedrone is one of the best RC&#039;s and much better &quot;value for money&quot; than, for example, cocaine.&nbsp;

				Etizolam is technically an RC and I love them, so it gets my vote.

				Me! 25i is my favourite but as mentioned above because you generally have a lot of the drug due to it being cheap it&#039;s quite hard to regulate my usage&nbsp; ::)
