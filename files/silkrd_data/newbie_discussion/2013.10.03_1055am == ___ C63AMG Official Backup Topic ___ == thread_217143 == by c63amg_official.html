				We get really many questions asking about new orders at the moment. We will start selling very soon for those who already have bought from us. Only Heroin and Cocaine will be available for cheaper prices due to no commission.

				are you gonna answer the question &#039;how much short was the last order of white that you sent me&#039;??<br /><br />or do you not know?<br /><br />if you answer the question then people will order from you. if you don&#039;t answer it, then nobody is gonna order from you. only the real c63 would know the answer. he would be able to answer me straight away, no problems.
