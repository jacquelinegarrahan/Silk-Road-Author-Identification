				ok according to your details, you didn&#039;t sign for it, you weren&#039;t arrested, and you admitted to it the second the officer showed you his badge, also they don&#039;t know where the package came from ? I&#039;m sure if they intercepted your package, they know where it&#039;s coming from. <br /><br />your story sounds a little fishy, but if your telling the truth <br />you fucked up when you said you knew why undercover cops are at ur door. <br />You should have been like no 2 seconds ago you were a delivery man why are two casually dressed officers are at my door.

				I&#039;ll admit it sounds a little fishy but as soon as they asked you to &quot;step outside&quot; thats where I would have kindly said &quot;I&#039;m sorry officer am I under arrest? If not then theres nothing I can do to help you&quot;. Despite how you should have never used (I assume) a fake name such as John Smith or really said anything to them once you assumed they were LE. Even if they had placed you under arrest, you would have had much more going for you then even saying one word to either of them. LE loves intimidation and a technique like hiding behind their badge to remind you their dick can&#039;t get hard anymore is one of the oldest in the book. I do hope some LE is reading....go fuck yourselves piggies.&nbsp; 8)

				it sounds fishy cuz there is a lot bust stories on the road. what stood out to me when reading the details was <br /><br />Cops intercepted it but dont know where it came from. da fuq<br />control delivery with no signature ?<br />you admitted to it, but was not arrested?<br />you think because they dont where it comes from you can buy time?<br />if you talk to the cops, they would have asked where it came from. im guessing you said i dont know where it came from even though you admitted to the fact that you knew drugs were coming in the mail?<br /><br />if your story isn&#039;t fake then you ordered a small time amount and their trying to get closer to the big fish.<br />also your talk on road wont incriminate you unless you told them bout the road.<br /><br />IF your story is real I wish the best of luck to you

				Exactly. The bottom line is that if LE can&#039;t prove you either paid for a particular product shipped to you, or requested it, then they can&#039;t make a case beyond a reasonable doubt that you imported anything illegally. That&#039;s because people are free to send you things and you&#039;re free to accept them- if you don&#039;t know (by the legal standard of reasonable doubt) they contain anything illegal. That would include pretty much any package that is properly packaged and wrapped, while being improperly or inaccurately labeled.<br /><br />And if LE started banging on your door shortly after you got back home, if they don&#039;t have a warrant then you MUST exercise your rights and refuse entry by saying that you don&#039;t consent to any searches of your premises. Even if they do have a warrant and find your package&#039;s contents, that would almost certainly get thrown out of court if they didn&#039;t properly establish your wrongdoing in the importation of the product.<br /><br />Go with the flow, keep your mouth SHUT (everything can only be used AGAINST you, not for you), ALWAYS exercise your rights, and retain a lawyer if LE ever tramples upon them. You can sue for damages if they do. This involves any kind of activity, whether it&#039;s fully legal or legally questionable in any way.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155332.msg1085417#msg1085417">Quote from: dgrassman on May 03, 2013, 11:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Did you sign for the package?<br />did they charge you with anything?<br />were you raided?<br />did you admit to anything?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you did which is why they want to work with you but you should fill us in<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Awesome.<br /><br />Well, I think now you&#039;re just taking it too lightly. I highly doubt that the vendor you bought from hired a couple of guys to wave fake badges in your face and give you a hard time. That&#039;s simply ridiculous thinking on your part.<br />The LE will be back, and with a search and seizure warrant; authorizing them to search the premises and seize any illegal controlled substances ad unreported(IRS) cash. They came to your door, for the pills, and asked, &quot;Do you know why we&#039;re here&quot; ... You said it yourself, they could have been there for ANY number of reasons, but in fact, they were there for ONE. Pills.<br /><br />You said &quot;Yes&quot; ... you acknowledged that a crime has been committed. They now have probable cause for the above mentioned warrant.

I have nothing in my house so they can warrant all they want. my phone is diffrent my computer is wiped, at this point im feeling pretty good concidering the situation...these guys wanted to know where i kept the bitcoins in my house...I have the best lawyer in the area when he got on the phone with the officer the officers tone changed to an &quot;oh shit this isnt going anywhere now&quot;.

				WRONG. Police can question anyone at any time and take notes while doing so. They don&#039;t need to read to your rights. But if they detain you or arrest you, they do. Only problem is by that time, you&#039;ve already probably fucked yourself (which is why you&#039;re being arrested in the first place).<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the munky man is fucked at this point. Otherwise he&#039;d have already been hauled off by LE.<br /><br />But honestly, answering in the affirmative when LE shows up at your door and asks, &quot;Do you know why we&#039;re here?&quot; is just plain, fucking braindead. That&#039;s the first thing they&#039;ll write in their notes, and the first thing they&#039;ll show the prosecutor when building their case against you. They may not have enough evidence in the end, but this may be the single most important lesson you&#039;re gonna learn.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155332.msg1087389#msg1087389">Quote from: razerblade on May 04, 2013, 11:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if no miranda anything you talked about in the hallway can&#039;t be used in court. never admit to anything, get a lawyer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Festivalia is right. They may not give a shit about a tiny shipment to an individual. But if they&#039;re really looking for a bust, or you piss them off, goodbye.<br /><br />Just remember that they need evidence tying you to the shipment. It must be proven that it was requested, and/or payment was made in exchange for it by you. Otherwise they can&#039;t conclusively say that you actually imported anything illegally. It&#039;s not a slam dunk. Not unless you fuck yourself by either admitting to requesting the shipment, and/or paying for it. That would be an open and shut case for the prosecutor. Easy plea bargain for a felony, then jail.<br /><br />If LE ever returns, don&#039;t you say one fucking word to them until your lawyer is present. Be very respectful, but firm. That&#039;s it.<br /><br />Good luck.

				wanted to update every one XTC Express has been great in all this they are very helpful I&#039;ll update the first post to say the same as to not slander him further.<br /><br />I have yet to be charged in fact I have yet to even hear from them. I don&#039;t take this as I got away but just no update there yet. <br /><br />I also wanted to mention that this is not customs or feds I am dealing with but city level(or county level) police. All in all I have a road ahead of me but without being too optimistic I think I&#039;ll be ok

				There is something just wrong with this thread. You haven&#039;t said what country you&#039;re in.<br /><br />If its not the USA, most LE just sieze your shipment, unless you order large qty, in which case you go to jail no if&#039;s and or buts. They wont ask nicely if you ordered large qty of illegal stuff.<br /><br />If it was USA, my understanding is you&#039;d probably already be smoking pole by now instead of posting on SR.
