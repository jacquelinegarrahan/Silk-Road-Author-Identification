				So without being specif of details I&#039;m interested in peoples experiences with the legal system. Im new to SR, new of it for a long while but have always done conventional business however, need to keep up with the times as they are a changin&#039;... A few questions are...<br /><br />Have most people come straight to here and been off the radar or are their old timers from back in the days of selling 8ths weighed using a penny!<br />Anyone had close calls with the law, fought them and won or lost..<br /><br />Obviously vague details are better.

				I have been involved with different types of drugs for quite a few years now. I have had a few close calls like getting pulled over, detained a couple times but have never been arrested (knock on wood). But I do know one thing, I feel much safer ordering my shit from SR instead of having to meet sketchy people in back alleys late at night. I used to be armed to the T, sometimes even just to guy buy weed cuz man you never know what some of these crazy mofo&#039;s are gonna try and pull.

				I know what you mean, its my first time doing things online and it seems such a better option. Im still getting to grips with this other world but im looking forward to adapting and learning. Ive been to prison before and been done for a few other things, just had a really close call which made me rething my whole game and going for a different route.
