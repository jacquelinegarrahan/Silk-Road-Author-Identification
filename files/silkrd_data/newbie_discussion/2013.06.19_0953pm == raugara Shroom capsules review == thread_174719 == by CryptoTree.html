				So I just received and tested a shipment from raugara and since he hasn&#039;t had a forum review in a couple of months I figured I post one. <br /><br />It&#039;s decent quality. I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s the most potent shrooms I&#039;ve ever had but they weren&#039;t weaksauce either. Next time I&#039;ll probably up my dosage (I had 2.5 and previously had smaller doses than that. Most of my experience is with acid but shrooms were my first love so I wanted to get back to the nice warm fungi). <br /><br />raugara ships his stuff in capsules which in my opinion is THE way to take it. No taste, ultra easy to take, easy to measure out. Highly recommend trying it that way if you hate the taste normally. <br /><br />Also fast shipment and pretty good stealth. Will probably buy again from him.

				Sorry to say I just tried my capsules from raugara and they were weak sauce.<br /><br />Started slow but ended up taking 12 capsules total over a period of a few hours, which iirc is 6 grams.&nbsp; At first I felt nothing but now during what should be the peak of the trip I feel mild effects, but no visuals, even closed eye.<br /><br />I&#039;m writing this review now, do I sound like I&#039;m tripping?&nbsp; I hate to say I might even start responding to work email.&nbsp; Shrooms should not equal responding to work emails. <br /><br />As a point of reference I have ordered from two other shroom vendors previously, but wanted to try the capsule thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Before leaving a low 1-5 rating on my order I wanted to come here and get more background info.&nbsp; If this were Amazon I would say fuck it and leave 2 stars.&nbsp; But a vendor&#039;s rating seems even more critical here than Amazon, so think it&#039;s more productive for people to stay cool and get their facts straight first.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174719.msg1254815#msg1254815">Quote from: CryptoTree on June 19, 2013, 09:53 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So I just received and tested a shipment from raugara and since he hasn&#039;t had a forum review in a couple of months I figured I post one. <br /><br />It&#039;s decent quality.
