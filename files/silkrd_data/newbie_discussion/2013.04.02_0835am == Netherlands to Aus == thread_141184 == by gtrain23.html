Why?? Because of their drug laws or should I say the lack thereof. Plenty of other OS countries to choose from ie UK. That&#039;s not to say it won&#039;t get through but the likely hood&nbsp; of your order being intercepted are high. Same reason why you would not buy coke from Columbia dude!!

				I had assumed that it would be hard to recieve but guess it depends on stealth I guess<br />Of certain vendors! <br />Very interesting that someone hasn&#039;t had issues<br />A buddy has actually ordered from a vendor and we were havin this discussion<br />So thought if ask around! <br />Well hope it isn&#039;t to bad to recieve<br />Thanks guys<br />
