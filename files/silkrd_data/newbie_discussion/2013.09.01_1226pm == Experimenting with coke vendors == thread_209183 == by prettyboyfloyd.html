				Well I&#039;m pretty damned satisfied with a first batch of oders that included Lloydsbros coke - smooth, no silly cut-drip, no phet jitters, a clean/chatty almost dreamy flowing high that&#039;s tempted me to play with the leftovers this morning&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />But so I&#039;ve been chopping through the rumour mill and (leaving aside variations between one block and another), it&#039;s hard to get a clear view on whether anyone else&#039;s C is better. And with under 50 posts I can&#039;t chat there... <br /><br />So:<br />Bungee54seems to have a huge rep but there&#039;s been a couple of slightly negative comments based on the guy&#039;s previous batch. He&#039;d be an international order, which is how risky, honestly?<br /><br />Symbiosis seems to have a strong presence in the market place but from what I can figure out he&#039;s made his rep more on mandy than coke.<br /><br />And then there&#039;s Sukey&#039;s &quot;ultra-clean&quot;; although I get the impression Germany&#039;s got a trickier customs route than Bungee in Belgium.<br /><br />Meerkovo&#039;s writeups looking exciting...<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m missing someone good with this list.<br />I appreciate it&#039;s a bit contentious to make a thread like this but reckon at the end of the day that products get priced for quality while the marketing is a mainly a necessary game for both sides.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do coke often, so I&#039;m less bothered by price than quality.<br />Any advice from personal experience would be great.

				There is a Coke Review Thread, Coke Purity Test Thread and Individual vendors threads. PMs those who have used vendors you are interested in purchasing from. Just remember to be nice and you&#039;ll get your answers. Personally, LloydBros, always top quality, whiteyfords hi-heat, KoTT has resolved his quality issues and Rails are all highly regarded. As for EU vendors which it seems you are looking at, there are plenty of dutch vendors with bomb ass gear to get your rocket rolling. Peace!!

				Hi just posted the following elsewhere, I think it could help you out too.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also purchased from Lloydbrothers, Budworx, Koltbiz, Rails and PeoplesDrugShop.&nbsp; Koltbiz was the best, but not by a large margin. Lloyd and Bud both had different products, but equally as good. Lloyds was a bit more energetic, Buds was more chilled.&nbsp; Both seemed high purity, just a different kind of high, and could well have been my headspace at the time. PeoplesDrugShop burnt my nose, felt pretty nice, but nothing special, it was cheap though.&nbsp; Rails had super shiny coke, very clean and made me very chatty.&nbsp; But anyway, below is the first review I&#039;ve written and it was for Symbiosis&#039; coke, which I&#039;d rate third after Koltbiz, Lloyd and Bud.<br /><br />Hi there, I&#039;m new to the forums, but I&#039;ve been on the road for almost 10 months, so I&#039;ve got a bit of experience with a multiple vendors on here. Anyway I purchased one gram of Sym&#039;s cocaine recently and was pleasantly surprised. My experience is described below. I always think its a good idea to not post location on hear, but sometimes it can be helpful - I&#039;m in a land far away with strict customers, and the coke took 3 days to get to me, that ridiculously quick. Ordered on Friday, received Wednesday, 3 business days is unheard to my country, so good job on that! Packaging was simple, but effective, MBB and doubled vac sealed, no baggie inside, but a lot of the coke vendors and doing this now to reduce the size of the letter, so I guess its acceptable. It could be improved by taking a note from JesusofRaves book, he made it look like the order was a real business, had an invoice, which without giving away too many details, gave a reason of why there was a bag of something inside the letter. Not sure if this would fool customs, but definitely one better that just a plain paper. One other thing, not a massive hassle but be aware it looks like Sym, or his/her, supplier has done an acetone wash (you could smell it as soon as you opened the bag), burnt a bit on the first bump, but once it sat out on the plate, it dried out in about 30 mins, no more burn after that.<br /><br />Anyway, to my experience now:<br />Set and Setting: at home with girlfriend lying on my bed, listening to music, warm and sunny with a slightly cool breeze, which by the way is an amazing combo when you&#039;re high.<br />Dose: Varied, but usually between 35mg and 100mg, if I&#039;m eyeballing. We weighed the first one and it was 35mg, it increased slightly over the session. Redosing every 30-40 minutes, this lengthened during the session.<br />Effects: Ok, so railed 35mg, slight burn (as described above, this went away after the coke dried out some), first rush as soon as I lifted my head up, slow easy come-up over about 15 minutes where it reached its peak, stayed nicely euphoric for about 15 minutes before slowing coming down, bit of anxiety at this point, but I havent done coke for a while, so I think its just because I wanted more. Euphoria was blissful and chilled out, chatted a lot with my girl and listened to some of our favourite music - Flume! At about 30 minutes, we wanted to get some good rushes, so we up the dose to 50mg, my girl went to 40mg, this came on strong and fast, never tried it but I imagine this would be similar to rush from IV coke, I just needed to sit back with my eyes shut and appreciate the beauty of this product, no burn this time, but maybe my nose was numb so I couldnt feel it. From here we continued to redose by eye between 35 and 50 mg every 30-40 minutes. I did at one point try 100mg to try and get that rush I had earlier, but in hindsight I should have known this would just make me jittery and anxious, I got a bit paranoid that my housemates would come home too, comedown was a bit rough from the 100mg, but that was solved with a 30mg bump. We reached a point after about 2 hours where both of us really didn&#039;t feel like doing any more coke, it just didn&#039;t feel as magic as the start of the session. So I took 3mg of xanax (but I have pretty big tolerance, I&#039;d recommend only 0.5mg to start, and maybe another 0.5 30 minutes in if you are relaxing enough), my girl took 1mg. And we both just lay in bed relaxing, listening the music, and had some great sex, not too bad getting hard - took a while, but got there, and after that it wasn&#039;t an issue. After about 20 minutes, the xanax started to feel really euphoric, and almost bring back that bliss we experienced with that first bump.<br /><br />Overall a fun afternoon, with not much fiending just lots of fun, usually I can&#039;t stop until the whole bag is gone, but now we&#039;ve got some left for another time round.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried plenty of the top vendors on here and Symbiosis is definitely underrated, I never see Sym given the credit he/she deserves.

				I&#039;d have to give a shout for DrCol, v good smooth product, the latest batch is classic cola (he&#039;s currently off SR but back on Monday). good friendly comms, excellent stealth and packaging.

				If you&#039;re looking to go domestic US, I would highly recommend MariosGramShoppe, MarloStanfeld (although he doesn&#039;t seem to be around anymore), and Studio54. They all have quality product and are up to date on the latest stealth and what have you. Internationally, I&#039;ve only ever ordered once but the vendor&#039;s account no longer exists so I won&#039;t even go there.
