				I seen a few articles about Mt Gox should be hands off, and that you could realistically host your own wallet. The whole bitcoin process is still a mystery to me. Anyone able to post some good thread links to bitcoin for starters type stuff ? I hesitate to read the clearweb stuff because it seems some of if not most of the big articles are scams or sales pitches. <br />The security area seems to have been overloaded with other types of articles. <br /><br />

				Go with Bitinstant.com<br /><br />All you have to do is make a cash deposit via moneygram and your BTC is in your wallet quick as fuck!<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGPSfJ4tCSA<br /><br />The option to use a bank isn&#039;t there anymore but it is very easy at walmart dude :)

				Some people on the Forums will tell you not to use your SR wallet to do the transfer but from Personal XP I have used my silkroad BTC wallet for every transfer with no problems at all.&nbsp; Also there is no way of tracing Bitcoins so you can (in my experience) just use the wallet address on your SR account and have the coins sent directly there.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				campbx.com is another good BTC exchange srvc. Once you create an account with campbx, you can deposit cash thru a postal money order. Once it arrives &amp; is posted to the balance, it can then be converted to BTC and then xferred onto SR.

				So how does Bit Instant work ? I assume there&#039;s a MoneyGram option in the Pay From options but maybe it&#039;s gone because of the cash deposit being down . So is MoneyGram like MoneyPak , where you pay a desired amount then you receive a code or something ? Can someone please explain the process verbatim because this seems like the most convenient way .&nbsp;

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
