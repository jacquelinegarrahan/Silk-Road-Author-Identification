				I always thought speed was just a street name for Meth (which means it has the possibility of being cut with other stuff like caffeine. Kind of like the difference between MDMA and Ectasy) or just a general term for any kind of upper.

If you have ever taken meth, you have taken speed.

				With a normal dosage you get awake and your awareness is increased. You may feel hyperactive or nervous, you mouth gets dry and you don&#039;t feel hungry / thirsty anymore. Your sexual drive also increases. Effects last for about 6 hours. The comedown is nasty, as you get tired but still can&#039;t sleep, you will feel a strong urge to take more of the drug, resist! <br />Methamphetamin is even stronger, it will have an effect on your body for 9+ hours.

				How would you compare that to an addy high? <br /><br />Also when used recreationally, don&#039;t people dose higher for addy than they would for a prescribed dose?

Crushing would be more effective. <br /><br />Your second question can be answered with yes, since a high dosage would be counterproductive for ADHD people.

				I would NEVER do amfetamin again. I have never had such a big and long comedown on any other drug. And the high is not even that good.

				the best thing about speed is that after a few days of geeking you hear leo whispering to you from inside the microwave and you understand that there is a plot afoot being perpetrated against you&nbsp; by the people that you know. <br /><br />seriously speed sucks. watching someone dig out their own fucking eyeball is unnerving. <br /><br />who am i to judge though. if you do it then smoke it instead of snort it. that way you wont be up hallucinating for so many days

				Well, speed can be both methamphethamine or amphetamine sulfate. I tried the second one.<br />You are active, euphoric. You feel the music and you can dance. The mind is clear, and when the effects disappear you can sleep pretty well. In small doses you can concentrate and study.

				Speed is such a broad term. I&#039;ve always taken it to mean any amphetamines.
