				So here&#039;s the thing....<br /><br />I made an order from the US to an EU country and it still hasn&#039;t arrived and there are two days left to go to autofinalise. I did some research and found that while some parcels can arrive in as little as 4 days from the US others can take from 4-6 weeks to arrive thanks to the vagaries of the postal system of the country I live in.<br /><br />Now I have a good feeling about the vendor I ordered from, and I believe he sent the package as he said he did and the hold up is due to the postal system in my country but what should I do?<br /><br />Should I click on resolve and ask for an extension of time and if I do this will it have a negative effect on my buying stats? As A newbie I don&#039;t want to have a bad rep trying to buy from other vendors.<br /><br />Should I go against all advice here and FE because I believe he sent the parcel and either it will arrive eventually or if it doesn&#039;t it is because it was seized by customs in my country which probably isn&#039;t the vendor&#039;s fault. Would this be a better way to protect my buyer stats.<br /><br />All advice will be gratefully considered.<br /><br />Cheers.

				Yes, you should click &quot;resolve&quot; and extend the auto-finalization date.&nbsp; That&#039;ll give it a little more time for the package to get to you, and it will NOT affect your stats at all.<br /><br />Good on you for not FE&#039;ing!&nbsp; :)

				Your buyer stats will not be affected negatively at all by taking it to resolution.&nbsp; The only time it would affect your buyer stats is if you:<br /><br />a)&nbsp; let it autofinalize<br />b)&nbsp; receive a refund from SR<br /><br />DO NOT finalize early!&nbsp; Stay in escrow and just extend the auto-finalization!

				Thanks Scout for your detailed reply and thanks also Thekimber.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to follow your advice. I&#039;m going to look for an extension and msg the vendor to let him know why I&#039;m doing this.<br /><br />Again I&#039;m really grateful for the sound advice.<br /><br />Cheers.

				Looks like you got it all sorted, but I still need 50 posts.<br /><br />Extend the time. Finalizing early defeats the whole point of the escrow system. Vendors that know how to handle their business will be fine if it takes a little while longer for the transaction to finish. Silk Road is revolutionizing the black market, and this wouldn&#039;t be possible without the reliability of the escrow system.
