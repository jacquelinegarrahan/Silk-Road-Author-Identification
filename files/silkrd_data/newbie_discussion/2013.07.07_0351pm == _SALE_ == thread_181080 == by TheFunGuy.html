				;D ;D ;D SALE ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />We have revised our previous medical grade marijuana sale prices and have dropped them even further to $44/8th!!! This is honestly got to be one of the best deals for an 8th of medical grade bud on SR! Here is what buyers are leaving for feedback:<br /><br />&quot;Great seller. Friendly service and quick shipping. Great stealth. Product looks and smells very good&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Really quick! Top quality&quot;<br /><br />&quot;very happy with purchase. i needed to have this order in a very short time and vendor went out of his way to get it to me in time. great product, great stealth, super quick. def give this vendor a chance, he has good product and great customer service&quot;<br /><br /><br />Second, we have just added a few more strains to our selection of Shroom capsules. We have just added Penis envy and B+ strains to our existing Golden Teacher and Pink Buffalo strains. Here is a great review of our product:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177758.msg1279856#msg1279856<br /><br />We have also added options to order 1/4 oz mushies at a discounted rate.<br /><br />These prices are as low as we could possibly go so get it while it&#039;s still on sale! :)<br /><br />Check us out at:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/91bd298d3e<br /><br />Thanks!!!

A lot of people would not even bother with an eighth, although I guess that&#039;s a good way to test out the quality of the product. You could do sample orders too if you wanted to get people trying your products.
