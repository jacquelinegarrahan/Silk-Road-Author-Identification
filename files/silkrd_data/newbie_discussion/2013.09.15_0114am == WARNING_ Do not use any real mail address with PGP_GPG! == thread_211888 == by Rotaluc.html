				I&#039;ve just imported a bunch of public keys from the Newbie PGP Club thread.<br /><br />I&#039;m rather scared to find that MANY people appear to have a false sense of security and their public key holds an actual mail address that actually belongs to the user!<br /><br />For several users I now have a Gmail address. The police will be more than happy to have that.<br /><br />Instructions for the police:<br /><br />1. Read Silk Road feedback for cocaine seller to see who&#039;s bought it.<br />2. Search the forums for someone with the same nick who might have posted their key, perhaps PM them to ask for pubkey to discuss something<br />3. Get mail address<br />4. Link to IP/ISP<br />5. Get address from ISP<br />6. Get search warrant<br />7. You&#039;re nicked<br /><br />But in some cases I have even found addresses that are using some clearnet domain that appears to belong to the user! I run a simple whois and I have your full name, your full address and your telephone number! If these mail addresses are correct, I have, right now, the full name and address for two Silk Road users.<br /><br />I sure hope vendors are smarter than this, but I suspect this way even a few newbie vendors could be nicked.<br /><br />Remember people, the mail address you enter in PGP or GPG is, upon publishing your public key, PUBLIC. It does not have to be a functional address! Mine is z@y.x. GPG does not care.<br /><br />Be safe!

				Thanks. Great post. I never knew you could use a non functioning email address to create new keys. I created a gmail account with a fake name, but LE could still link that to me right?<br /><br />So I&#039;ll just create a new key with a random ass email like skfhsarkgj@zsjhbskv.com?<br /><br />This is why people should not just spam to get to 50 posts, I have learned so much in the time I&#039;ve been in this forum. <br /><br />

				Thanks. This makes sense now. I was wondering what the point of the email account was in this. I thought that somehow the pgp messages went through the email account or something. <br /><br />Level of security just went up a notch.

				You&#039;d think that it&#039;d be common sense to not use your real email address.<br /><br />Sadly, this world is full of ignorant people.<br /><br />It&#039;s up to people like the OP to set a good example for those that lack said common sense.<br /><br /><br /><br />The only time you should use any information that&#039;s closely associated with yourself is when you send your shipping address to the vendor...via PGP message, of course. Delete vendor public keys from your records when you (or even before, and just kept copying their public key from their page) cease communication with vendor, after transaction is complete.<br /><br />Never make up usernames, passwords, or anything else, to use on SR that you&#039;ve EVER used before on the internet. Keep it unique and unlikely that anyone can ever think, &quot;OH, that&#039;s probably so and so. He always uses -insert anything easily associated with yourself-. I personally like to make up shit to use on here by using the Keyser Soze method. ;)<br /><br />Constantly change your passphrase and pin number for safety. Never leave trails.<br /><br /><br />These aren&#039;t tips from an experienced SR user. I&#039;ve only just recently started on SR. So, if any of my tips need improvement or changing. Please, any experienced members, correct me.<br />

				Great warning, thanks! Haven&#039;t really figured out this about PGP yet?<br />I&#039;m using countermail which is supposed to be crypted and not logg any IP etc. Better than hush-mail regarding that. Is PGP still necessary?

				I&#039;m no great shakes on PGP, bitcoin or other stuff but you have to be patient.I myself am getting better everyday with said subjects just by putting in the hours. In my short time here around the forums and the like it seems so many people are rushing into SR expecting to have product within their first week of joining without doing the proper research. <br /><br />I&#039;ll admit i got a little excited when i joined aswell, but relised fairly quickly that its quite easy to get caught without the proper steps being taken to conceal your identity. Its the most valuable product on silk road IMHO. Hope everyone stays safe and one step ahead of the law. Knowledge is power in this game.

				Well actually thinking about it, i wouldn&#039;t have used an isp based email... it would be a safe webmail address which i would have signed up to using a VPN to hide my ip/location etc. So many I could have used a &#039;real&#039; email after all.

				I used an anon mail (safe-mail) in my private key but I&#039;m not posting it here. It&#039;s only for vendor comm. Most vendors seem fine with me sending them private messages using their own keys. They reply unencrypted but its just general chit chat and coffee. ;)
