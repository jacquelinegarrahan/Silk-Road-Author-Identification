				Aside from the PGP encryption.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this is appropriate at all, but I seem to always leave a note after my address when placing an order. Just a general thank you, I know my address format is weird but that&#039;s how it works here, looking forward to your product, and things like that.<br />Is that something a vendor will appreciate, or is it better suited for an additional message to the inbox instead?<br /><br />Are there any other things in general, that a buyer can do to make life a little easier/enjoyable for the vendor?

				Hmm I&#039;ve never put anything in the box accept my encrypted address.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read one vendor profile that actually says they want you to put stuff in there like packaging options but I didn&#039;t use that vendor so.<br /><br />I think of it like this, if you do something weird and vendor doesn&#039;t like it he will either cancel your order, deal with it, or tell you to stop doing it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But I would love to hear others thoughts and experience on this, I am still new so I can only make assumptions and we all know where that goes...

				I would say not being difficult. <br /><br />e.g. Not sending messages asking stupid questions, or asking for favors or exceptions which contradict the vendor&#039;s terms and conditions.

				Give them an honest review --- if you had a really good time, let them know and give their potential buyers tips tailored to their product.

				I like to message vendors I&#039;m going to purchase from beforehand to let them know I&#039;m going to make a purchase. Hopefully that isn&#039;t annoying and they appreciate the advance notice.

				I&#039;ve seen a couple of people say that newbies should send a message asking if it is okay for them to place an order since they have no reputation. I feel like the vendor can easily just refuse the order and that the extra message might just be annoying. What (any vendors reading this) are your thoughts on this?

				Yeah, I feel like at this point in SR&#039;s existence most buyers explicitly state their concerns in their pages and T&amp;C&#039;s. Most things are just common sense, like Limetless said, type your address correctly.&nbsp; I just type mine in as it would be on a letter and I&#039;ve never not received my items in a timely manner.&nbsp; Also, so many vendors mention things about not complaining to them about exceptions, there must be a large number of young morons trying to get free or reduced prices because they have no money or can&#039;t manage to get bitcoin.

				True shit toast, that reminds me, I couldnt grab bitcoins till next week, so I kindly asked for someone to help me with just .04 bc&#039;s and I will give em back double next week, and my man JackieChan (he is SR Vendor) Helped me out! Just wanted to give him a shoutout for his awesomeness lol. But yeah thats a good example cause I have no money problems, my problem is time, But instead of asking the vendor I wanted to buy from to treat me special, (Like your regular everyday self-absorbed prick) I just went to the forums lookin for a kind heart lol. And I found one! and they are awesome! and a vendor lols. And now I just discovered Jackie sells good priced lucy too so I will buy a sheet from him soon also. See how awesome shit works out here when you use common sense? Lol, I guess that could be considered common sense? who knows Im high as shittt

				That&#039;s so awesome Not_A_Sheep!<br /><br />I&#039;ve had really good interactions with vendors. They&#039;ve always been quick to answer any questions I have about their products. Just as long as you PGP your address and you&#039;re not a dick you should be fine.

				Be patient. Be understanding. The vendors are facing far greater charges than the buyers should something go wrong, and have been more deeply involved in the business than most of us. I&#039;ve learned invaluable lessons from reading product pages and buying instructions alone. Just remembering this, and remembering that they&#039;re dealing with far more complex concerns than some eBay seller, goes a long way.&nbsp; <br /><br />bc.
