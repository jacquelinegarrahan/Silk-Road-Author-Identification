				So in all this downtime I&#039;ve been browsing in onionland and have come across a bunch of different sites offering various different wares at prices at or better than SR. One site I found appears to have apple products at 50% off. Another offers ounces of uncut coke at 1200 and molly for 650 an ounce. This seems too good to be true. Some sites offer escrow and reships and partial refunds, but since there&#039;s no 3rd party regulation I feel like they can make any claim they want then take your loot. The stolen Apple gear site looks legit and I&#039;ve seen it mentioned on multiple sites but can&#039;t actually find anyone who&#039;s used it. I hear all the time people get caught hiring a hitman online because it&#039;s really a cop. Are these sites just phishing for someone to arrest for something or are they likely to just take your money?<br /><br />What I like most about the Road is pages and pages of reviews. Sellers who have completed hundreds of transactions with little shenanigans. No links, but anyone who&#039;s used some of these and knows what I&#039;m talking about get at me.

				I&#039;ve been al over onion land. Scams 90%. Legit 10%. Then the legit always go to the Road. I&#039;ve been burned by clever guys. If you can&#039;t verify the DENY

				There&#039;s 2 other blackmarket &#039;ebay&#039; style sites that I know of, BlackMarketReloaded and Atlantis.<br />They are both very similar to SR with only a few variations:<br />BMR is exact to SR in most ways, the main difference is that they sell weapons which SR has banned.<br />Atlantis is a more &#039;modern&#039; approach, its site is more intuitive and easier to use I find, they also trade in litecoin which is the alternative currency to BTC. It&#039;s a bit cluttered though in my opinion.<br /><br />I&#039;ve encountered no other similar sites, other than individual .onion sites offering services and products: Obviously, it is advised you avoid these as there&#039;s no way to tell if they&#039;re a scam and no turning back after you&#039;ve sent the money.<br /><br />When SR is down I recommend BMR, it&#039;s only slightly behind SR for popularity and there&#039;s many SR vendors that have listings on there, of course it&#039;s recommended you verify their identity by sending them a message on SR checking that the BMR page is legit.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but I recently had to deleted my tor browser bundle as it got infected by a goddamn mother-fucking worm (which infected every single .exe on my computer, even the damn installation files for a clean XP so I had to download EVERYTHING again which was a real bitch) so I don&#039;t have the BMR links but I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find it somewhere.<br /><br />As always, use a different password and pin from your SR account.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I recommend you don&#039;t migrate to the other blackmarket sites and wait the DDOS out, SR is and will remain to be the original, authentic and best black market and the DDOS shouldn&#039;t scare people into buying from other sites. Remain loyal to our good servant DPR. I think that where all other blackmarket site admins could fall for greed and scam their customers, DPR will remain true thus we should remain true to him. (Inb4 cult following).

				From back in the day when BM first came out, the view was that it was shady as hell, lots of scammers, etc. I don&#039;t know about them now, but I still have distrust from back then.<br /><br />Atlantis I know less about. They&#039;re new, seem to try to be transparent, and slick. I&#039;m holding off on attempting anything there due to 1. loyalty to SR and DPR, and 2. paranoia, as it very well could just be another darkmarket.ws
