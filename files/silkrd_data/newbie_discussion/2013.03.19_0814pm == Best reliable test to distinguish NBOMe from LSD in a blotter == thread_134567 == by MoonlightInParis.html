				I&#039;ve been searching the web to find some answers to this question.<br />Apart from actually trying the tablets, or things like checking the oral absorption, are there any reliable tests (like the reagent tests) to distinguish between LSD and nbome blotters?<br />Does nbome react in Ehrlich test?<br />Does it shine under black light similar to LSD?<br /><br />Tnx

				i can always tell what it is by the taste<br />LSD has zero taste and all other RC chemicals have a very bitter taste<br />there are testing kits you can buy tho if you really want to know and pay money

				Haven&#039;t tried Erlich&#039;s for NBOMe, but Erlich&#039;s is supposed to only react with chemicals of the tryptamine family.<br /><br />Just taste it.&nbsp; NBOMes have a very distinctive, bitter taste.

				Just tried the blacklight trick with 4 different types of blotter, three of which i believe to be LSD and one of which is almost certainly an NBOMe (sold to me locally as L). The NBOMR was by far the brightest under black light but im pretty sure this is just because it was laid on extremely white/clean paper. I don&#039;t think this test is reliable for much.<br /><br />I just picked up some Elrich tests which should only react (turn purple) with indolol rings central to tryptamines, however I have read about some people getting pink colors and even purples with NBOMes. I have not yet tried it on my NBOMe blotter.<br /><br />Marquis may be able to distinguish LSD (black) from 2c-x/NBOMes (no reaction or yellow)<br /><br />I got the info above mostly from browsing clearnet forums and no sources are reliable enough to cite....

				Look at the reviews on here. I trust when other people have tasted it or when they have tried it.

				Update:<br /><br />Just dropped a half tab of the NBOMe into a NIK modified Ehrlich test kit and got no reaction. Maybe a very slight yellow/green tinge, but definitely no pink/purple. <br /><br />One tab of this stuff numbed my mouth like fucking novacaine, came on hard starting around the 15 minute mark. and provided a vary intense 6-7 hour trip with powerful 2c-b esque visuals.

				Taste testing is all well and good, but if it&#039;s not what you were expecting it may be too late by that point..

				Its certainly possible to do chemical or taste tests as mentioned above, but my preferred method is to go with the most reputable vendors to avoid wasting any money.
