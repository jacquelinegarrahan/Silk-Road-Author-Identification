				I had some of the brown MDMA from Symbiosis and it was good. The vendor has good rep. Have a little sample yourself ( I mean little too ) and check you pupils after 30 mins to see if they are dilated. Ha ha that what I normally do as I have never used a test kit.

				Ive had MDMA before that made my pupils so dilated you couldnt see the brown, yet I felt perfectly normal and wasnt rolling for anything, so checking the eyes is not a good way to &quot;test&quot; your mdma

				me and a friend did the white powdery batch from symbiosis last night and it was amazing! <br />took about an hour to kick in not sure if thats because i wrapped it to tightly in a cigarette rolling paper, would make sense&nbsp; though because my come up was slower compared to my friends, <br />I had roughly 250 mg over the night which i think was a little to much, i boffed at one point but still felt fantastic, <br />i dropped it at 12, kicked in at about 1 and was rolling hard til about 430 with it gradually dropping off and ending at 6, got the awesome visuals on comedown as you would expect from a larger dose<br /><br />my friend who has had alot of experience with MDMA from within our city thinks it was the best they&#039;ve ever had and vows to never buy in real life again as the quality is no where near what we experienced last night, feeling a little tired today (i only slept for four hours) but not feeling sick and not really scattered either.<br /><br />my friend fell asleep easily but it took me about half an hour to nod off which considering the dose is pretty good.

				This white powdery instance was very weird for me. I have done different mdma for the last year - every 2-3 months or so.<br /><br />This is my report from the symbiosis thread -<br /><br />Started the evening around 9pm , dropped 220mg wrapped in a little piece of toilet paper.<br /><br />+15 minutes : Start to feel it , very nice and warm feeling, very talkative and touchy.<br />+25 minutes : peak is arriving, it is VERY not comfortable, very confusing. Rapid heart beats, sweating a lot - starting to feel not good. a bit of anxiety.<br />This continues for about 15-20 minutes.<br />+50 minutes : euphoric bliss, very touchy and talkative with my gf.<br />+1:30 hours : starting to come down - still feels good though.<br />+2 hours : smeared on bed, hugging non stop and slowly falling asleep - seeing a bit of cool visuals and stuff that are not there.<br /><br />another update that i didnt write in his thread is that i gave a friend 110mg and she said she had a bad trip, she felt anxiety and skin tingles and excessive heat and sweating. she is not going to try mdma again after this experience (her first time was a complete bliss.)<br /><br />She described it quite accurate since while peaking i felt really hot and was dripping sweat - and my heart was racing (this is the part where i was feeling something was maybe off).<br /><br />Overall I can say I &quot;enjoyed&quot; it but other mdma (street mdma) was better for me. This one had almost no bliss and euphoria for me - don&#039;t know why. (I was after a 3 months break.) and it was very short.<br /><br />On the other hand - people on his thread are reporting they are enjoying this. you can check it out here - <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=44468.0

				I&#039;d like to do a quick review of Symbiosis&#039; &#039;Pink Squares&#039; pills. My first one so bare with me. It may also be important to note that I&#039;ve been taking 5-HTP as a daily supplement for my general well being for&nbsp; almost a month. We tried them on a Saturday evening with nothing to do except smoke loads of bud in his garage and talk a load of bollocks.<br /><br />5/5 Delivery - Ordered 11pm Wednesday. Marked in transit Thursday AM. Arrived Friday AM, UK2UK....<br />4/5 Stealth - Double VacPac&#039;d and hidden inside another item. No giveaways from the outside of the packet, or once opened, although very to easy to locate. Maybe a problem for those with particularly housemates/parents.<br />?/5 Communications - No need for communication so cannot comment.<br />5/5 Quality - Pills are hard pressed and break cleanly along break line which is a huge bonus as we chose these over raw MDMA for ease of dosing and to save having to bomb up every night in the tent. Me and a friend dropped half each around 7pm, got impatient after about 20mins and dropped another half each. 45-50mins I could feel the onset of the come up, my friend nothing. 10minutes later I was definitely rushing. Hard. My body was tingling, energy was surging through me, the music pulsing through my veins. I couldn&#039;t help but get up and go dance in the rain, which felt like ecstasy on my skin. My friend was coming up to, maybe not quite so hard (we think this is the difference the 5HTP makes, our tolerance is generally very similar but he was holding his shit together way better than me), but the grin spreading across his face from one ear to the other confirmed that he definitely on the up. The initial rush seemed to grow in intensity for the next hour, coming in waves almost, the next always stronger than the last, washing me in euphoria, never returning back to baseline though. <br /><br />After the come up, I plateaued at an amazing level. Music was beautiful, I loved everything and everyone, conversation was spilling from me in all directions. I felt warm and energized and the waves of rushing were still washing over me, albeit in frequently. This lasted for perhaps another 2hours at which point i dropped another half. I came up just as hard as before although the really intense rush didn&#039;t last as long. plateaued at the same kind of level as the first drop. Dropped another half another 1.5-2hours later. Again, another intense rush, though I think this was too much for me and i ended up puking 10minutes or so after really starting to rush again, which is something I haven&#039;t done since my 4th or 5th time rolling (I&#039;ve lost count by this point), I&#039;d only had 3 cans of stripe and about a Henry of Lemon Haze which is usually all in a nights work and wouldn&#039;t even touch the sides normally whilst I&#039;m rolling. After puking I felt rather sober and proceeded to snuggle up on a sofa indoors where I fell alseep with no trouble.<br /><br />The next day i was little bit tired but no real comedown symptoms and my mate reported none either. He dosed the same as me and had pretty much the same experience though he didnt puke and didnt seem to ever be rushing, or as fucked, as i was at any point. <br /><br />We agreed this is probably the best MDMA we&#039;ve had in 3 years of regular-ish rolling and will not only be back to buy more but can highly recommend this seller.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone looking to buy from Sym.<br /><br />Best Regards and Happy Rolling you BuzzNuts,<br /><br />Martin Luther
