				Hi.<br /><br />I&#039;m wanting to open a drop box without giving my real ID and have seen several posters talking about these cards. How do I go about getting one? I&#039;ve checked on SR under money but there doesn&#039;t appear to be any prepaid ones at the moment. I&#039;m basically clueless how to acquire and use one, so any help or tips would be great.<br /><br />Cheers.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Take a look at danknugsdun, http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f25cbcd8d5 Probably gonna get one myself. Additionally, here in Ireland you can get pre-paid money cards from o2 (the phone company) which work like debit cards, I assume they have something similar in the uk?

				Yes, 3V is another. Well worth investigating. Verification is minimal. But you should note, that ou can use a legit exchange to buy bitcoins and thereafter transfer anonymously. There is no need to hide your initial purchase. Why hell, my ID , passport, driving license etc are with MTGox and Coinbase, as they are (Ok, MtGox in a little dodgy territory lately) registered and approved exchanges. Once you have your bitcoin, transfer to any wallet you choose and take it from there.

				There&#039;s a couple of sellers on SR selling cards, but none have prepaid funds. If u were to transfer cash into them would it not be easy for LE to find out where the cash came from?<br /><br />Cheers for the information anyway guys, much appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				We provide virtual credit cards for online shopping needs. <br /><br />We do not provide prepaid but we do offer a loading schedule by which you pay in bitcoins and we load the funds to the card for you :)<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Dank

				UK virtual credit cards are a little hard to find right now. A few months ago there was UKash Neo &amp; all4one gift card&#039;s virtual visa but that&#039;s shut down now and Ukash Neo&#039;s been withdrawn until later in the summer. <br /><br />3V is an option but I&#039;ve seen some negative forum reports about them (not here).<br /><br />You can get prepaid visa cards in Tesco but they&#039;re only in £25 or (if you can find them) £50 and they have&nbsp; £3 purchase fee attached. If it&#039;s just for a dropbox though a £25 tesco visa card should do.
