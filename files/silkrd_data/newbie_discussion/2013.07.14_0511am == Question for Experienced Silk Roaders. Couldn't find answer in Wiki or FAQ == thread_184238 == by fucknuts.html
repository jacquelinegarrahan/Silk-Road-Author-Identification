				I&#039;ve had an awesome experience here on SR, but now face my first bad transaction.&nbsp; Item never received, no response to messages, in fact vendor hasn&#039;t even logged in for 11 days.&nbsp; I&#039;m a few hours from resolution.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are my current stats:<br /><br />&nbsp;Member for: 2 months<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year<br />total transactions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$432.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$896.45 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1,235.30<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br /><br />My question is this:&nbsp; How much will one $30 refund effect my refund rate?&nbsp; I can&#039;t find the formula anywhere, and would consider just finalizing the damn thing to save my stats if it&#039;s too bad.<br /><br />thnx<br />

				it should be:<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;1 month&nbsp; &nbsp;3 months&nbsp; &nbsp;1 year<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;7%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3%&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2%<br /><br /><br />edit: refund percentage is the percentage the refund is of your total $/btc spent&nbsp; (is that sentence anyway understandable?)

				I&#039;m still listed as a newbie, as I&#039;ve only been an SR member for 2+ months.&nbsp; However, I have spent almost $3K during these past 2 months, and if I were you, I would just finalize and take the hit since it&#039;s only $30.&nbsp; &nbsp;After reading many vendor profiles, it seems as though they pay special attention to buyer stats (as they should), and I wouldn&#039;t want anything to negatively impact them.&nbsp; You can always explain what happened in your feedback for the purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d also be a little concerned at the fact that they haven&#039;t logged on several days.<br /><br />For myself, I follow a very simple rule of thumb when purchasing items on SR:&nbsp; &nbsp;If I can&#039;t afford to lose the cost of the item I&#039;m purchasing, then I simply don&#039;t purchase anything at that time, and wait until I can afford to lose it.&nbsp; It truly is a shared risk on behalf of the buyer and vendor. <br />

				I&#039;m going to finalize and leave appropriate feedback.&nbsp; Maybe when the vendor comes back from hiatus they&#039;ll work something out.<br /><br />Thanks SSS &amp; jack for the advice.<br /><br />
