				A letter of seizure from HMRS.<br /><br />eg.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;A parcel containing prohibited goods addressed to you has been seized. If you wish to complain/comment/claim, write to us at blah blah...&quot; <br /><br />Small amounts of stuff will get seized and destroyed. No proof it was you that ordered it.<br />Buying a lb of weed or like 2000 pills or something, will result in a visit from the old bill. <br />Percy amounts though, they just send you a letter and that&#039;s that.

				Depends on how big the parcel was and what was in it. Main thing would be LE coming to your house, but you can still deny you ever ordered anything as long as you hid the train from you to the vendor.<br /><br />Most likely just receive a nice love letter from customs.<br /><br />Also using SWIM benefits you in no way legally. And also you&#039;re using TOR so shouldn&#039;t have to post that anyway.

				If you&#039;re super paranoid, you can write RETURN TO SENDER on the package, and just leave it in the hall for a few days. Just in-case you do get a visit.<br />tbh though, I don&#039;t know of anyone (myself included)&nbsp; who would be willing to wait before opening their goodies. lol

				I wouldn&#039;t be too worried about a gram or two of this or that, which is all I ever order.&nbsp; As others have said I&#039;m pretty sure UK customs would just destroy amounts like this.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember around 15 years ago when we went to Amsterdam quite often, we&#039;d always bring back leftovers of all the different bags of weed and hash we&#039;d bought.&nbsp; It was nice to share the quality stuff with mates back in London.&nbsp; &nbsp;I recall that the UK customs rule was that if cannabis was seized it was a £60 on the spot fine and a slap on the wrist, so long as the amount didn&#039;t exceed 10 grams.&nbsp; If it was over 10 g, they would refer you to the police, where I suppose you&#039;d end up in more trouble and get a criminal record.&nbsp; &nbsp;Glad to say they never caught us!<br /><br />Not sure whether this same rule applies today, but I expect the odd gram in the post would be treated in the same way.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not worth referring to the police, as they have a lack of manpower, and they know that whoever the drugs are addressed to have plausible denial on their side (assuming they even used their own name!).<br /><br />Personally I&#039;ve never seen a customs letter.&nbsp; Between me and my mates who use SR, we&#039;ve had 90+ successful transactions, with nothing gone missing, seized, etc.&nbsp; Hat off to the Royal Mail !!!

				Just a friendly word of advice (because others have covered your issue fairly well): You&#039;re on SR forums, via TOR. We don&#039;t use &quot;SWIM&quot; or other voodoo incantations here. If your account name here or on SR itself can be tied back to something on clearnet, then start over with one that can&#039;t.
