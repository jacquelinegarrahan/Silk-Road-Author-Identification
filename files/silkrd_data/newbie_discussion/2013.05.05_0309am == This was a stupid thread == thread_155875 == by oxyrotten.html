				SO RX KING makes a contest that he&#039;s giving away free drugs and btc. Then says it&#039;s only for his customers.. and then?<br /><br />Where are the winners? Anyone win? nobody came forward! LOL. Was it a generous raffle, or a publicity stunt to get fame?<br />Wow, what a damn shame. people need to stop kissing this guys and realize he is ALL TALK.<br /><br />If anyone won this guys &quot;contest&quot;, please come forward to confirm. Otherwise, it was all just a lame excuse to get attention and seem like he&#039;s the top vendor around here.<br /><br />So.. winners? LOL

				Wait. So let me get this straight. You put some money in a raffle, then lost (which is what usually happens in raffles) then go on the silk road to accuse a vendor of &quot;scamming&quot; people? Because you lost? Based on no evidence, just that, clearly you&#039;d be the winner? Even though it&#039;s a raffle, a form of gambling in which you lose 99% of the time?<br /><br />If I were a vendor I&#039;d never sell you anything.

				i never put money in a raffle. u read it wrong. he wouldnt even let me join the contest (which is a free giveaway). but thats not an issue. i knew he was BSing from the moment he posted his too good to be true contest. and said he would announce winners during the kentucky derby. yet mysteriously he went silent about it. seems like a case of someone COUNTING THEIR CHICKENS BEFORE THEY HATCH and/or trying to rile up public support without having anything to offer.<br />lol. i hate arrogance.

				Do you really expect the winner to be announced? It&#039;s an illegal... erm... giveaway (not raffle as I first supposed). If the winner wants to come forward, they might do so, but i doubt they would (or should) for two reasons: they don&#039;t want to give away their identity, especially in a situation in which what was shipped and from who to an associated user name is publicly known and two, why would that person give a shit to announce it? Who knows if it&#039;s even been shipped and received yet. It also sounds like you lost nothing so why do you care. Additionally, unless you have some sort of evidence or at least an argument as to why you believe this was a scam I&#039;d at least like to see it posted. In fact, I&#039;d rather just see the information and leave the &quot;HES A SCAMMER&quot; all-caps commentary out of it completely.

				I don&#039;t know what kind of posturing you&#039;re talking about. it was just a thread and a small gift package. I never even read the thread, to be honest. And when i did click on it, he seemed to have made the rules fairly clear in the first post. As far as Karma, no one cares about Karma. Karma isn&#039;t part of a vendor&#039;s rating. It&#039;s a forum mechanic that no one really cares about anyway. As for &quot;announcing a winner&quot;? Use some common sense, man. that&#039;s not gonna happen. Did he say he was going to announce a winner at some point or something? Did the winner ask that his name not be revealed?<br /><br />Again, you keep calling it a phony contest, but without evidence for a belief that you assert as being a fact anyway. You come off as very immature to me.

				He said he was going to announce 6 (or 12 contestants), and 3 winners. But he just gave up on it when the site went back up. Which means it was a ploy to gain publicity points and impress n00bs and gain customers. Granstanding. Posturing. Delusions of grandeur. Megalomania. I&#039;m not bitter I didn&#039;t get to enter the contest. I&#039;m fine with THAT aspect. I&#039;m annoyed people worship this guy and he didn&#039;t follow through on (something that seemed to be) an impressive contest.<br /><br />Poor noobies.

Just take Black Marker Reloaded, Farmers Market.<br />Don&#039;t understand me wrong, I love SR.... have a lot of customers and log in every day at round 8am and stay there till bedtime..<br />The problem is that when you use this site specially as a vendor (the important part here !!) you need to have quality. Quality to be able to provide your customers the service SR !!! want you so much to give!!!<br />Of course, like I said before something can go wrong. A week no SR because of a serious reason...NO PROBLEM !!<br />But, just during the week so to speak it should work. One time not able to log in ....understandable two times....mnnn but F 30 !!! times is a bit odd don&#039;t you say.<br />You can ! change this but you need to invest.

If you don&#039;t invest it means that you don&#039;t give a shit, the junkies will buy even if it cost half a day to login...same as the vendors who want to make money<br />When you have enough you can sell it.<br />There was a rumor that it was already the case, no idea, don&#039;t care.

Were you just trying to get sympthy on your vendor page??? And you were embarrassed to come clean in here? The only thing is CERTAIN is you are a total liar and NOTHING you say has an OUNCE or credibility.<br /><br />Also when the king talks shit..he backs it up...not with 4 other accounts I made...I just tell the truth.

				Good on you Rx for exposing this idiot. I can&#039;t believe he is still carrying on, trying to defend the indefensible. Jesse, you&#039;ve been exposed as not only a complete and utter liar, but as a complete amateur in all that you do. Talk is cheap and for you to write - <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; Where you get the idea that I have cancer ...as far as I know I am very healthy but maybe you&#039;re a psychic....or know everything, that fit your disease...among others narcissistic and&nbsp; megalomania. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />shows you&#039;re a lying prick, praying on the sympathies of others to drum up business. So what&#039;s the truth Jacky? Are you a cancer survivor or not? I certainly wouldn&#039;t believe you either way cause as Rx has illustrated to the community, your a lying cunt!<br /><br />So the vending name is finally public - Jacky. I hope other buyers avoid you like the plague and spend their money buying from reputable vendors, not amateur hacks like you who avoid using their vending name to protect their vending account. It&#039;s easy to create a false name or three to post your pathetic views instead of standing behind your vending account with those opinions. Buyers, steer clear of this lying prick and spend your coins elsewhere.<br /><br />Congrats to Rx for exposing you for what you are. All he did was show the community your words, posts that you wrote, which demonstrated his point of view and backed up his claims. ??? &gt;:(

But he just gave up on it when the site went back up. Which means it was a ploy to gain publicity points and impress n00bs and gain customers. Granstanding. Posturing. Delusions of grandeur. Megalomania. I&#039;m not bitter I didn&#039;t get to enter the contest. I&#039;m fine with THAT aspect. I&#039;m annoyed people worship this guy and he didn&#039;t follow through on (something that seemed to be) an impressive contest.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor noobies. There are other vendors our there that don&#039;t try to run dodgy publicity stunts.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Watch RxKing come in here and make up some excuse. Mark. my. Words.<br /><br /><br />reading about that contest, I&#039;m sure he is a fraud.<br />And no, he will not come in here....are you crazy LOL....he and make excuses?<br />The megalomaniac...yes, that was the good word for him.<br />And yes, there are other good vendors for original oxycontin 20, 40 and 80mg.....jacky LOL<br />Report to moderator&nbsp; &nbsp;Logged<br />jacky: for the best, original, cheapest European OxyContin 40 and 80mg<br />Oxynorm/codone 20mg fine powder in gel capsules.<br />Fentanyl 100 sticker type patches 23.12 mg (the strongest)<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I just wanted people to see what a total fucking LIAR and scammer &quot;jacky/Jackoxy&quot; is...<br /><br />Here are two post made back to back on the first page! BY THE SAME PERSON!! ON TOP OF THAT HE IS A VENDOR!!! So he makes a lying post under Jacky then logs off...then logs back in under Jackoxy and makes another post in the same thread....RIGHT AFTER HE JUST MADE HIS POST BOUT ME USING &quot;JACKY&quot;<br /><br /><br />This go&#039;s to show you what a total fucking loser this person is. can you imagine taking the time to create multilple accounts in a&nbsp; forum as a vendor to TRY and talk shit over a free give away that he was never in??? It is LAUGHABLE....and who do you guys think oxyrotten is????? If you said Jacky or jackoxy you would be correct!!!!<br /><br />He had to do this to keep this thread looking like people agreed with him! As I told him many a time...NO ONE DID .. I have said in this thread that this is all 1 PERSON. ANOTHER JEALOUS VENDOR.<br /><br />ou can also see that jackyoxy has the same things for sale in his signature that his &quot;jacky&quot; account sells!. He is just a total LIAR and a loser. And basically a stalker...HE LOVES RXKING ;)<br /><br />Now the shocking part is he sells total&nbsp; shit!! I would never even think of him. He in no way shape or form a vendor I would even consider is a real vendor. He has been here a year and I have never heard of him. he is that little and that much of a nobody. He lies in his home &quot;shitty&quot; country to get free drugs. then he sells them on here. He BARELY sells anything and even though he gets for free buy lying to his country...he still gouges his buyers...But whatever...that&#039;s his shitty business. The part is the lengths this loser has gone to be a fraud!&nbsp; Sad Sad person.&nbsp; LOL..I mean all this for me over a free contest!! WHAT A LOSER...<br /><br />So he created these new names on the 5th of may( 3 days ago) and started posting about this. He also messages me with oxyrotten trying to get into the contest! LOL...I asked if he ever ordered from me, then I told him how fucking stupid he is that he can not read! Then he got upset because he is a lying bitch(and dumb as fuck) and&nbsp; he decided to do this. This whole thing failed MISERABLY and the KING wins yet again. I always laughed at this...i knew from day 1 it was all 1 person.<br /><br />So the lesson is....just do not be a lying scumbag like this vendor shows he is (I am not sure what name to call him)....And if he is capable of these lies.....what are all the others he is telling? I mean there is a reason he has -40 Karma...This whole group clearly had this loser figured out.<br /><br />SO get ready for more lies and excuses by him..That is all he has.....<br /><br />

				I havent read the whole thread myself either.... I just know what my personal experience with RXKING is..... very demeaning in nature like he is somehow better then us all.... at least he has us talking about him...I say the best thing to do is just leave him and all his personalities alone to argue amongst themselves.... If no one is talking about him he hurts..... just drop the RXKING threads altogether....<br /><br />just 2btc
