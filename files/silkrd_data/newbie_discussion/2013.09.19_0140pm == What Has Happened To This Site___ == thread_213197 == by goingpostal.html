				Hola amigos,<br />I believe you can setup some special automatic filters on the forum&#039;s software to make this temporary bans automated.<br />About the swearing, I think keeping your cool is paramount to being a digital pirate.<br />We have a saying in my pueblo, &quot;A dog who barks never bites&quot;.

Not saying anyone should ever call another forum member that, but if I say &quot;Damn, that sh#t car of mine broke again&quot;, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m really hurting anyone. I mean, there&#039;s no watershed here or what? Kids shouldn&#039;t be here anyway. Banning words is just not right.<br /><br />Flames and trolls should be removed/banned/tempbanned as appropriate, but just swearing?<br /><br />Does anyone have a link to such rules? I don&#039;t see any sticky (perhaps searched the wrong forums for that) and the rules I saw when I registered didn&#039;t mention anything about swearing IIRC.<br /><br />Addition: I just tried to post this message and it failed with a strange message saying my last post was 0 seconds ago. Trying again now with removed swearwords..

				hahaha cryngie i can see why you got banned. that was pretty damn rude and patronising :D nice work!<br />discussion is a bit of a joke. it&#039;s peoples safety, health and money on the line and they demand no hint of aggressive language. sorry to offend but i can barely stop a &#039;shitcuntballsack&#039; slipping out when i really want to smash something. it&#039;s messed up the way they are banning people for sharing information in the most visible place.<br />i think this is the issue in question and only relates to discussion. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You must use a polite tone and stay on topic.

				Try not to cuss on here, if you go around blabbing your mouth off to everyone who makes you mad theyll just&nbsp; think you&#039;re some 14 year old pussy who talks too much trash and thinks hes a big player in &quot;the game&quot;, if you&#039;ve ever seen the hierarchy of a drug lord, its always the small time peddlers who are violent scum. silence is scary

				Is there actually a single instance of somebody on here being banned for swearing, or does each ban involve swearing while flaming another user? There&#039;s a key difference there.

				it&#039;s usually a temporary ban from posting on vendor discussion pages. you are still free to purchase listings and use the forum. persistently pissing off the mods/admins will result in a permanent ban by the sounds of it. it&#039;s not a great idea to do that anyway.
