				Keep in mind what caused SC to go down.&nbsp; &quot;The greatest risk to security is the belief your insecure methods work&quot;.<br /><br />You do not need to drive anywhere my friend.<br />Visit BOA.com and start a free e-banking account.<br />There are no fees or anything. (unless you ever try to use a human-teller)<br />Once you have a free account with them, you can use Account Transfer to send money to Bitfloor&#039;s account from yourPC@BOA.com<br />Bitcoins are not illegal.<br />Nothing about bitcoin is illegal.<br />Create 3 www.blockchain.com accounts.<br />Deposit your coin to Account1<br />Move coin to Account2<br />Move coin to Account3<br />Now your Coin is 100% annonymous.<br />How do I know this works?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Imagine a jar of 1000 pennies.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you put 5 pennies in that jar and shake it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you take 5 pennies back out.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; did you remove the same exact pennies? probably not.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you&#039;re welcome.<br /><br />on another note: I tried bitfloor.com for the first time today and am still waiting on my money over 2 hours after I deposited the money to their account. Will update later.<br />=====================================================================================<br />The danger of this person is, well ask blockinfo about their fogging/mixing/tumblr services.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ask rely on what you asked last month - ask now.&nbsp; This person has an OK amount of posts.&nbsp; And some rep.&nbsp; He is instructing noobs to do what he is doing.&nbsp; A danger to one is a danger to all.&nbsp; Also I wonder if this person knows a BIT is not a penny.

				Huh?&nbsp; I fail to see how this person is &quot;dangerous&quot; .... and, yeah, blockchain has disabled anonymous sending for the time being, but I don&#039;t think that makes this person wrong or dangerous.

				Actually, perhaps the problem is that we haven&#039;t done ENOUGH blow to understand it ... ;P<br /><br />(and yes, it seems there has been some excitement here about you this past week!&nbsp; glad to see you&#039;re still around.&nbsp; truth be told, you add a nice bit of personality to the forums.)&nbsp; :)

				It is not anonymous.&nbsp; A bit is not a penny.&nbsp; A belief you are secure when you are not is a serious fucking bummer.&nbsp; If this person sells this idea to noobs like myself who accept it as part of their regular ritual (Best processes &amp; practices)... And said noob uses on a site that does not care about privacy like SR.&nbsp; Said noob could have problems.<br /><br />no blow needed.....&nbsp; You can exchange your coin through as many wallets as you like.&nbsp; If I can see the hops, I say with great confidence anyone can - I am not very smart or on blow.

				I have not done any drugs in two weeks, and this still makes no sense to me. <br /><br />It actually hurts my brain to try and unravel whatever this means. <br /><br />I suggest a full-time for the OP for hurting our drug-ruined brains, it&#039;s the only way...&nbsp; ;)
