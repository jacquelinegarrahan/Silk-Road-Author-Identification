				I hate it too. What this guy does is run that given site until it&#039;s too known as a scam, then just opens the same thing with a different URL.<br /><br />How about a DDOS attack on that site? I&#039;ve seen you can get those for $20. Heck I&#039;d pay that to take that stupid scam site down for a while, then he&#039;d have bigger issues on his hands than setting up his damn spam bot over and over.

Says they assess the target and then depending on how much bandwidth they think it will take to take it down they come up with an hourly rate. Looks like about .1 btc per hour is the minimum so taking them out long term would be kind of cost prohibitive. But heck maybe there could be a donation box for people sick of the spammer. It wouldn&#039;t stop him from spamming but he wouldn&#039;t get any income either if no one can get to his site to get ripped off.
