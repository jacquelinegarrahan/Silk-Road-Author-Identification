				Maybe I just haven&#039;t bought it in a while, but, I recall spending $50 a gram for it.&nbsp; For pretty good yip, too.&nbsp; Why am I seeing it for over a bitcoin which seems to be about $108 as of this moment?

				Hello iwantsome,<br /><br />Because, simply put, the quality generally available here is far superior to the street, premium coke carries a premium price tag like most premium products.<br /><br />Based upon PineappleLove&#039;s lab test results &#039;Independent Cocaine Lab Test Results (See the OP)&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950 ItalianMafiaBrusells (89% out of 89%), Koltbiz (88% out of 89%) and Bungee54 (87% out of 89%) are all good bets. The maximum of 89% is possible because the coke is converted to a base for quantitative analysis. Perhaps it&#039;s more than what you&#039;re used to paying but the old adage when it comes to coke is true &#039;you get what you pay for&#039;, in fact it works out cheaper in the long run to invest in high purity coke because the effects last much longer, a little goes a long, long way :)

				i think the prices are very high for coke on SR<br />i dont think the quality is better then the stuff on the street for the most part<br />some people i know who are heavy into coke went back to buying locally cause the quality is equal to or better and the price is $40 cheaper a gram<br />maybe it depends what street you live on lol<br />there is several threads on this and lots of people agree<br />

				I hope it&#039;s because the quality is better, but I&#039;ve yet to try any. It does seem fairly expensive though, but maybe I&#039;ll try a small amount first to see!

You pay for the actual amount of cocaine in the powder you receive.<br /><br />Street prices per gram are certainly a lot lower compared to SR, but then again, what you buy off the streets is often more filler/cut than cocaine. <br /><br />Add the cos tto shipping onto that, and you may pay $100+ for a gram of top notch cocaine on SR, delivered to your mailbox. You could spend that same $100 to get 3 grams of powder on the streets, but i doubt those 3 grams would actually contain 1 gram of cocaine if you do. As such that is not a big problem, but if you get something from the street that is 25% cocaine, what is the other 75%?

				Following this train of thought.<br /><br />1) how to confirm purity (off the road and here) as in what is the standard being used to test? <br />2) what else is in this 89% pure?<br />3) what is the general purity on the street (i know this varies by location and supplier so refer back to question 1)<br /><br /><br />some math time. 89% pure 1g. costs 100$ roughly. if your street was at 20% pure. and 1g costs 80$. you could in theory cut your product by 100 % (turn 1g into 2g) and your purity would still be 45% (double the street) and your costs would have gone down now to 50$ per g. <br />4) does this make sense? <br />5) what would be an advisable cut then? quality/safety stand point. (no not for the road thinking street resale)

				In our SR user survey from 6 months ago (that i&#039;m currently about to submit for publication), coke was not popular with SR buyers from USA - it wasn&#039;t in their top 20 drugs bought. But for Australians, cocaine was third after MDMA and cannabis as a drug of choice to buy from the Road. When you look at the usual prices of coke in Australia, you see we pay upwards of $250/$300 a gram, and probably shit quality too. So the SR prices look pretty good from an Australian perspective!<br /><br />I can see why USA buyers wouldn&#039;t go for coke on here, but interesting to hear that some do due to increased quality/purity.

				I bought a small amount of cocaine from two highly recommended vendors.&nbsp; I could not believe the poor quality of the coke, especially as compared with coke from the 1970&#039;s and 80&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;m still hoping to find decent coke on SR, but I&#039;ve found I can&#039;t trust the reviews very much.&nbsp; They are all too positive in my opinion.

				shit... thanks for the reply.<br /><br />this still is amazing to me. How is it possible ? I asked in another thread and never really heard anything but... if you are from SoCal, FL, NM, TX.. in my mind you are getting higher quality product at cheaper prices than someone in NY, or NJ.&nbsp; I know other markets a little better and I can say that weed is cheaper and of higher quality in Cal by comparison to NY.&nbsp; So why is this not true of coke? <br /><br />In all honesty I know the coke in my area isn&#039;t stepped on, its run the fuck over. Like it is garbage compared to further south. It&#039;s hard to even make a decent run cooking it. <br /><br />But it mystifies me. Like a while back (a handful of years) I was in touch with some friends in FL and they were talking 700 a nut, and good quality. Stepped on a little but.. still room to stretch it out and it would be considered decent/good.&nbsp; by comparison the stuff in my area, which as I&#039;ve said is garbage (probably better to snort month old dog shit) goes for 1400ish depending on a few things.<br /><br />So as I mentioned in the other thread, where are the vendors of this relatively high quality, and fairly cheap product. I mean seriously is it to hard to get a nut mailed for 1k? So there you go, made 300 on top of whatever you were making (probably 100) to flip the nut anyways. Realistically you&#039;re making 400 just to flip nuts. That sounds pretty decent in my books. <br />Then up here a person like myself can flip it for 12-1400. Or I can stretch it a little. Or I suppose if you were desperate you could break it down and sell zips at like 80 per g (2200 total doing that).<br /><br />I mean does this not make sense? everyone gets a piece of the pie and the world keeps going round. <br /><br />As for finding it on the street. Let&#039;s leave it as I&#039;ve never had a problem finding things but a new source of higher quality independent of locals is never a bad thing to have.

				The real reason? Because it can be. SR is as close to a supply and demand market as it gets. You have multiple vendors from all over with all different connections all competing for business from people from all over with all sorts of connections. Whatever people are willing to pay, vendors are going to sell.<br /><br />Now this leads to the fact that the C on this site is typically of much higher quality and people with a little money to spare are willing to pay a premium for C that has a much lower chance of containing phenacetin. Also, you pay a premium for the lowered chance of getting screwed. I trust the vendors on SR more than on the street because (most) vendors on SR don&#039;t know who you are or care about giving you bunk product - they want your money, repeat business, and good reviews. Even one bad review from a prominent member could be far more costly than giving than cheating that one member. Thirdly, you have people like pineapplelove who actually test the product and hold vendors accountable. You pay a premium for this. Essentially, you can either pay a premium (like I do) for a more reliable purer connection on SR or you can roll the dice for a cheaper shadier fellow off the street.

				you realize that 50 a gram (still cheaper than my location) still works out to 1400 a doughnut right? <br /><br />at any rate, I&#039;m getting at the same thing you are. well I&#039;m asking what you&#039;re getting at. I assumed SR would have nuts (doughnuts, oreos, Os, Oz whatever the hell you want to call it) for cheaper than the local people and it should be far better quality. But from what I&#039;m seeing it isn&#039;t. The quality seems to be hit or miss by the comments here, the price is nothing to get excited about. So whats the deal? where is the good price for the good quality?

				Probably the 2nd to last thing I buy on here, and have gotten with a friend who&#039;s been on here a year, but we&#039;ve gotten some (eh ..it&#039;s alright) coke, from a German vendor, then just a few months back got some for a friends party, and out of two American vendors, one was the best yet, and he was charging $75 a gram, which is rare on here, I know, but we knew it was incredibly good. Tested for cuts, came up clean. <br /><br />That guy only had it for a month or two, but you&#039;ll find bargains like that every once in a while. <br /><br />Rarely see it for under 150 a gram US. Though there are some, it&#039;s just it&#039;s a rare occasion. <br /><br />One of those things I try not to make a &#039;habit&#039; of.&nbsp; ;)

				It does seem that most of the listings are for small personal use amounts of 1 g or a few grams. There&#039;s not much in the way of bulk/wholesale sized listings, though I&#039;d assume that there are some folks doing custom orders and wholesaling that way. I&#039;m not sure what it would take to buy enough at a good enough price to where you could resell some ounces locally to small retail dealers. I think coke and weed are the two drugs that are most likely to cause domestic mail seizures in the United States because of something random happening and the package being discovered. Also manufacturing and high level distribution all flows from drug cartels so the supply chain looks and acts differently than mdma and psychedelics. Interesting question though.

				I suppose one hindrance to selling coke by international mail is that customs use sniffing dogs that will detect it, even in packaged well. <br /><br />You can easily send a package with 1000 mdma, valium or similar tablets through the mail undetected unless the package looks suspicious enough for customs to x-ray it. <br /><br />Also, i guess it has to do with the country of origin for shipments. Cocaine producing countries generally do not sell that many other products online globally. If a package originated from a country like india or china, it could very likely contain some electronic gadget that is not worth any attention. But if it came from, for example, columbia to europe, that would be very unlikely.

				The only way to definitively proof purity is lab analysis. <br /><br />Just the look of something does not prove anything at all if the producer intended it to look that way. I suppose its even feasible to make something that looks like very pure cocaine visually that actually does not contain any cocaine or active substance at all. <br /><br />Selling that on SR will probably not be much of a success though as you&#039;ll get negative feedback from anyone that buys it, but on the streets it could be pulled off as long as the vendor takes off before anyone comes complaining. <br /><br />Reminds me of a case where someone sold 50 mg (!) diazepam tablets as mdma at a festival several years ago. Combined with the alcohol flowing on those things he was long gone before anyone managed to wake up and complain about it.

				it is definately very expensive.&nbsp; But all depends on where you are and who you know IRL for you to determine if worth it.&nbsp; In the US if you live in major city or near Mexico border you can find excellent quality for MUCH cheaper.<br />If you live out in the sticks somewhere good luck ,probably should suck it up and pay the extra on SR.<br />And it would definately not make any sense buying cocaine on SR for resale.<br />And to the person above who said just because it looks&quot; fishscale&quot; doesnt mean its good , good point.&nbsp; With good cuts you can make something that will get you numb, get you high, smell and taste like coke, and shines rediculous, and is 10% real cocaine.&nbsp; Just like people who assume that because its rocked up and not powder that its not cut.&nbsp; That is an experienced coke dealers dream customers <br />

				Maybe I&#039;ve been out of the game too long, but there is some excellent quality coke on SR. I really don&#039;t think that for personal use the $100 /gram price range is too much. As others have stated you get what you pay for and when you pay for quality the experience is better and the product lasts longer too.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only tried two vendors: godofall and bcpltd. <br /><br />When I bought a gram of godofall it was the cheaper unwashed variety. It was like no better than any of the crap I actually CAN get on the street and it was more expensive. Again to be fair it was the cheaper stuff (at the time approximately $85 /gram; I think now this variety is $100 which is too expensive for this quality) and the vendor does mention that the washed product is much better. FE not required and product is shipped quickly and stealthily.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought from bcpltd several times and his product is claimed to be acetone washed fish scale. This stuff is great, way better than anything I can purchase locally and consistently at $99 is only slightly more expensive than godofall&#039;s unwashed product. He does require FE for all purchases but all of my several orders were smooth, stealthy and quick- recommend.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try MarloStanfield&#039;s product soon. He claims he &quot;will have the best prices vs quality on Sr&quot; and since the price is definitely lower than many I am quite curious to sample the quality.

				Its all overpriced here. I wont be buying it here when in real life I CAN and do get better quality for way less. So I wont have to worry about it anymore. It&#039;s easy to get in real life and in these threads where people are saying that it is not supposed to be speedy they are full of shit to some extent. It&#039;s a central nervous stinulant so yeah it should be speedy if it is in th e80% prurity range.

				I live in a European country and where i am at Coke cost pretty much the same as i pay for it here (Perhaps a little cheaper).<br /><br />The reason why i have only bought coke locally once in the 16 months i have been a member on the road is that the stuff i get through the mail from here is usually 70%+ in quality, while the local quality (According to the health department) is most commonly around 15-25%, and last year there were no street seizures of higher purity than 65%! This means, that if i get average quality from my local dealer i am paying 3-4 times more per gram of actual coke than i would do when ordering on the road. Besides i have the luxury of getting my blow delivered directly to my door so i dont have to deal with real live coke-heads.<br /><br />That is a win win situation, and a no brainer i would think...

				A more direct thought on this subject. might be alot gets caught?<br /><br />I here from news a lot of really BIG shipments got busted and this is lately.<br />You may have read about it.<br />The 2 speedboats that got tracked and busted. One threw everything over board before they shot out engines.<br />Another tried to avoid capture by driving near coast but to no avail.<br />Thats only the one you hear about.<br /><br />All this must have some effect.<br />because if it all got thru there would be alot of surplus and the price would be lower.<br />That supply and demand thing again.<br />So since there is not an excess and coke is the fave of the rich and <br />famous basically the price will be higher as they can pay it.<br /><br />And since really good coke is a great high if you can afford it<br />saves you from getting addicted if you cant afford it.<br />I dont condone stealing money for drugs. If you get to that point thats sign to get some help.<br />Some people by nature are easy to get hooked and some are not. Cant blame them really <br />life sucks for most people and you have the right to the pursuit of happiness. If it feels good do it.<br /><br />I for one have done a lot of drugs like crank and coke mostly.<br />I always worked from 16 yrs old.<br />I wanted to always have weed and some chemicals. I like to get high but not everyday.<br />I look forward to weekends for party time. it keeps you going.<br />In high school days used to walk around saying &quot;got any chemicals. What you got for the head&quot;.<br />&nbsp;I always had shit.<br /><br />But I can remember in the end of my heavy crank use I lost my job got&nbsp; laid off.<br />when unemployment ran out and lost apartment and could not get crank with no money.<br />went thru tough times with girlfriend. But we stuck together.<br />Slept in the car or apartment complex laundry room during winter.<br />Till I found a job then we rented a great big room in a private house.<br />Things worked out great. We stuck it out and later moved to an apartment.<br />We never went to our parents for help it was just me and her a real team.<br />Like Mickey and Mallory I would say without the mass murder part.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Coke is the ultimate social drug and in most places is schedule I/class A so has always been expensive. Street coke is 20% or less unless you have decent connections. They&#039;re making a fortune. Probably buying it off here then cutting it. Think about it. You can make x4/5 what they sell here if you wanted to do that with 1g becoming 4 and most people who buy it don&#039;t care as they&#039;re usually too drunk to notice or just inexperienced.<br /><br /><br />

				Cocaine goes for $100 a gram in Montana. Yes, the character being named &#039;Tony Montana&#039; in the movie &quot;Scarface&quot; is rather ironic. The snow up there is the water based kind, not the powder based... And, crank quality meth is the DOC for people into stimulants up there. So, if you live somewhere like that, the $100 for a gram of acetone washed fish-scale is market-price. Add to that the convenience of delivery (when I lived in MT one of the times I lived there, we had to drive an hour each way to buy a 1/2g of decent stuff for $50), and you have a deal that is amazing.<br /><br />I live in the capital city of my state.... and I can&#039;t find decent/any coke for 9 months now. I got some crack around Thanksgiving... I shoot, and so had to use vinegar to dissolve the crack into coke. The crack had soooo much baking soda in it, the shot was fizzing in the needle still. I didn&#039;t get high. Lame. That&#039;s why the SR coke is worth it to me. Find a vendor who sells 1/10ths... then you can get an affordable amount.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				I don&#039;t know if anyone posted anything like this, but here is a site that gives you Price per gram per country for a multitude of drugs.<br /><br />http://www.havocscope.com/black-market-prices/cocaine-prices/<br /><br />I don&#039;t how up to date it is.&nbsp; As far as USA(where i am) it seems accurate.&nbsp; When i buy locally i usually buy two $50 bags of coke. i never weighed my coke so i can&#039;t compare weight, but if i were to eyeball on sheer volume a gram on SR is more than double the two $50 bags i get locally and it much better quality.

If you&#039;re male, you will get to experience the female orgasm (or, I at least act like every girl does when I make them come.... back arches, toes curl, I pull my hair, I call out to god, I roll my eyes back in my head....). Seriously, IV Coke blows any other ROA out of the water. Just use as little water as possible, and pure coke will dissolve completely in water (no milky water, no residue)... And Crack can be converted to Cocaine HCl for injection by reacting off the baking soda with an acid (vinegar or lemon juice work, though are not considered &quot;safe&quot; by people serious about &#039;harm-reduction&#039;).... I find Coke is a guaranteed abscess if you miss a vein though, so make sure you have one if you try IV&#039;ing blow.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				SR is not going to be immune to the folks trying to turn a couple of ounces into a kilo by way of shady cut practices so I think it&#039;s important to do some research the vendor you buy from. Read the reviews the vendor profile but more importantly read the numerous reviews here on the forum. There&#039;s even the Independent Cocaine Lab Test Results (See the OP): http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.725 which provides invaluable information to help making your decision on choice of vendor. I was pleased to find out that my vendor of choice wasn&#039;t as bad as some of the others- still had levamisole but not as much as many others 9% with a 74% cocaine count- and that is about $100 per gram which I have said before I think is a decent price for quality cocaine.<br /><br />

				Its all relative. I pay my local guy £50 for a half g. Its enough for a night out. Some is very very expensive but I saw that some of it was lab tested and was as high as 87%! I estimate my guys at being around 70% so I would consider it worth the extra change. Their are too many scroats who think the persil washing powder they do 2000 lines of one gram is the bar to which all coke should be measured in price. Yeah great you get a gram for £30, ever wonder why? because its fucking 15% coke. If someone can send me 87% pure coke in the post, I will pay the asking price. It is not expensive

				Most of the coke where i&#039;m at is way cut compared to the wares here. Also you are paying a premium to not have to deal with dboys and possibly get arrested/robbed/etc. Obviously you need to take due diligence here and if you get caught with coke in the mail your getting a worse felony than getting caught in the hood.

				I just bought the 1.7g listing from MarloStansfield. With shipping it came out to $151 and change so $82 and change per g. Quality is still probably better than the street shit my friends are getting but for me I wouldn&#039;t do this stuff for more than a small line or two because I can tell it&#039;ll stuff me up. My friends on the other hand might be just fine with the quality/quantity ratio so Marlo will likely end up being my supplier for them.

				ayeseadee1080 contacted me as he said I would after I wrote him when my order came from him a week or two ago.&nbsp; I was not very impressed with the coke and told him so.&nbsp; I believe he told me that what he has now is better and he offered to make it up to me.&nbsp; So I <br />thought that a generous offer and told him I&#039;d be happy to pay him something for it, so we have an agreement.&nbsp; I&#039;ll report back on what I think of Ayeseadee&#039;s current batch of coke.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a feeling it will be good, and if it is and if he can let me know when he has this stuff in (and when he hasn&#039;t) he&#039;ll become my &#039;go-to&#039; man for coke.&nbsp;

				I find the prices are double what my street dealer charges me but fortunately are double the strength.<br /><br />I think it all comes down to what you prefer quality or quantity. I do find the dealers on here are charging a bit over the odds but to be fair there are lots of extra problems they have to deal with that street dealers don&#039;t such as parcels going missing, complaints, items being seized etc.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be lucky enough to find cocaine as strong as some of the SR dealers on here offer in my home town (South UK) but went I went to Miami the Cocaine I found was a lot higher standard then some of the stuff I have had on here and a lot cheaper, unlike where I live where it is the same price but not as strong. I think it has a lot to do with where you are based.

				Where SR really excels is for people who&#039;ve lost touch with the streets (and may not be too eager to re-establish them).&nbsp; &nbsp;You have a wide range of choices of nearly anything you might want with the competition in the&nbsp; marketplace to arrive at reasonable prices.&nbsp; Reviews/number of transactions, etc. give you additional data to chose from available choices.&nbsp; This is undeniably a little rough on newcomers but give a month and newcomers are likely to have quite enough purchases under their belt to get into the game.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a good idea for newcomers to confine their purchases also to small ones as over-eagerness and not knowing the ropes of the game can add up to considerable losses.

				The review system is a bit crude indeed. I think it should offer separate scores for things like delivery speed/stealth, product quality and communication. <br /><br />The current system takes all of it in one rating. You could&nbsp; be ordering 50% cut cocaine on time every time, and rate that 5/5 because the vendor is reliable and dependable, although the product is not. <br /><br />Obviously we have the forum to discuss product quality,but that isn&#039;t easily ranked on SR at all.

				Although prices are much cheaper around my parts the average quality on here blows it out of the water. I feel like most of the people who complain about prices are used to needing a gram to the face to enjoy the night, which is certainly not the case for some of he really good stuff on here.<br /><br />As far as the rating , I feel like the 1-5 is adequate for what people need to know quickly about the vendor. The forums are where things like quality and cut should be discussed in detail, and it encourages use of the forum which is good for both the buyer and the vendor.

				Although this is something I have been thinking about ever since I joined this site I was just now thinking of starting a thread about it when I found this one.&nbsp; That seems to be the one narcotic that is overpriced all across the board.&nbsp; You will find other things overpriced but also reasonable prices as well such as heroin.&nbsp; Initially I figured it was justified because of so much being advertised as &quot;fishscale&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought maybe 3 or 4 small bags just because I wanted to see what 85 percent pure was all about.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been disappointed every time.&nbsp; None of the stuff I&#039;ve got off here was really that great and your basic street stuff here is stronger.&nbsp; I won a raffle a while back on this site and my prize was 7 grams of &quot;fishscale&quot;.&nbsp; Now I didn&#039;t complain at all since it was free but was also some of the weakest most stepped on stuff I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I&#039;m not interested in binging on coke anymore as was the case back in the day.&nbsp; About 15 years ago when I first started messing with coke as a teenager I&#039;d buy an 8 ball for $130 USD and it was good, better than anything I&#039;ve got off here but still not that super potent shit.&nbsp; I want to get some real fishscale at some point just to see what it&#039;s like but when everything is advertised as &quot;fishscale&quot; and the prices are ridiculous it&#039;s not worth the gamble.<br />Last time I got coke locally was around a year ago and was good stuff coming off a brick (street cut level brick) and was $60 a gram.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to know why that particular drug that doesn&#039;t even last that long is so overpriced.<br /><br />You&#039;d think we&#039;d have some good South American vendors taking advantage of the local products purity and low cost.&nbsp; Where are you guys at?

				I absolutely agree with you Kaempfer.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t think most people here know what really good coke is about.&nbsp; &#039;Back in the day&#039; (the 70&#039;s) I had such a variety of great cocaine, some of it so pleasurable it was scary (and hard to control).&nbsp; And at $60/gram!&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing I&#039;ve had here even comes close.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how to account for it.&nbsp; These days the manufacturers put cow dewormer in their coke, right up at the top, before they even import it to the States.&nbsp; Who could imagine that years ago?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see why people waste their money on the offerings today.&nbsp; Except perhaps from some of the overseas vendors (Bungie, Sukey, etc.) which apparently do have excellent cocaine.&nbsp; But isn&#039;t that weird?&nbsp; We are so much closer to South America and we have to order from Europe to get good coke?&nbsp; At least I finally got some coke which I like, a special deal with ayeseadee (just a sample).&nbsp; It has a nice high and looks good.&nbsp; But even so, nothing compared with the coke I got regularly years ago.&nbsp; I know I sound like a broken record to others as I never seem satisfied, but I can only report what I know.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to run across someone every now and then whose experience is so similar to my own.

				There is plenty of good coke on SR. Some of it actually priced quite reasonably for what you get. You have to do your research here on the forums. There are numerous vendor review threads and at least one mega-review thread. Then there&#039;s the purity testing thread as well. All invaluable information for making an informed decision prior to purchase.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=170460.msg1296479#msg1296479">Quote from: Kaempfer on July 02, 2013, 03:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Although this is something I have been thinking about ever since I joined this site I was just now thinking of starting a thread about it when I found this one.&nbsp; That seems to be the one narcotic that is overpriced all across the board.&nbsp; You will find other things overpriced but also reasonable prices as well such as heroin.&nbsp; Initially I figured it was justified because of so much being advertised as &quot;fishscale&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought maybe 3 or 4 small bags just because I wanted to see what 85 percent pure was all about.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been disappointed every time.&nbsp; None of the stuff I&#039;ve got off here was really that great and your basic street stuff here is stronger.&nbsp; I won a raffle a while back on this site and my prize was 7 grams of &quot;fishscale&quot;.&nbsp; Now I didn&#039;t complain at all since it was free but was also some of the weakest most stepped on stuff I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I&#039;m not interested in binging on coke anymore as was the case back in the day.&nbsp; About 15 years ago when I first started messing with coke as a teenager I&#039;d buy an 8 ball for $130 USD and it was good, better than anything I&#039;ve got off here but still not that super potent shit.&nbsp; I want to get some real fishscale at some point just to see what it&#039;s like but when everything is advertised as &quot;fishscale&quot; and the prices are ridiculous it&#039;s not worth the gamble.<br />Last time I got coke locally was around a year ago and was good stuff coming off a brick (street cut level brick) and was $60 a gram.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to know why that particular drug that doesn&#039;t even last that long is so overpriced.<br /><br />You&#039;d think we&#039;d have some good South American vendors taking advantage of the local products purity and low cost.&nbsp; Where are you guys at?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I tried plenty of street coke throughout the late 80&#039;s to early 00&#039;s...just about everything was garbage you had to do tons of to get a decent high and left you not being able to breath through your nose the next day if not that same day. If you wanted quality you had to know someone who had access to it, didn&#039;t fuck with it because they did it too and you certainly had to pay for it. I remember paying over $100 a gram in the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s because it was excellent quality.

				Also bear in mind the fluctuation of the currency we trade in has a HUGE impact potentially on any vendor...in the past couple of weeks alone it has dropped rapidly (losing 40% of it&#039;s $ value!!!) and presents ongoing challenges then to cashflow. Sure it may bounce,...or it could continue dropping....all a risk.<br />SO by all means simplify the argument to street v SR, but factor in this too....it&#039;s a little more complex in 2013 than it was in &quot;73 guys ;)<br />Cheers<br />Doc

				So why are you here dfrosty?...just curious...<br /><br />Why don&#039;t people simply use basic test kits to ascertain the reality of &quot;cuts&quot;...it&#039;s not complex, nor expensive and surely you should as a matter of course test what you consume? If it proves a cut or impurity levels which are plain to see (the point of the test naturally) then they have a clear right to complain...often the response is subjective and harks back to an age where the user was likely late teens and pumped with hormones and the joy of life! (that does improve all drugs/drink experiences surely??) ;)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, perhaps I&#039;m a little sensitive when the assumptions stretch to include all vendors on SR <br /><br />Everyone has the right to question quality, but some of these later assumptions seem to be based on fresh air - and certainly as a reputable vendor I&#039;d like to at least fight for those of us interested in providing a decent service to this community...<br /><br />Cheers all<br /><br />Doc

				I believe that part of the reason is that the road caters to those who want cocaine but do not want to buy it off the street and these people tend to be willing to pay more for the luxury of convenience

				You&#039;re right DrCol about the difficulties vendors face what with the variable price for bitcoins and the need to convert them again to money on your end.&nbsp; Then there are the SR fees, the time required for stealth packaging, cost of supplies, messaging, dealing with the post office on a daily basis, etc.&nbsp; So I wouldn&#039;t knock the vendors for their prices.&nbsp; In my opinion, the problem really is with the coke market today, as <br />opposed to several decades ago.&nbsp; The 1970&#039;s were really the heyday for cocaine in the US.&nbsp; As I&#039;ve said before, I saw such a variety of great coke and nothing half-way comparable from the half-dozen disappointing purchases I&#039;ve made on SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few days ago I got a gram of &#039;real deal fishscale&#039; coke from KingoftheTrill and was so disappointed.&nbsp; I figured if I spent a little more, then maybe I&#039;d get something I would be happy with.&nbsp; The photos of the stuff really looked nice.&nbsp; It cost $140.00/gram.&nbsp; But when I got it, it looked nothing like the photos

				Just wondering if people have seen vendors here posting results from purity testing? I figure most vendors would only have the testing kits available online, so nowhere near as useful as lab testing. Ideally vendors would be able to access lab testing and post such results. Not easy under prohibition though.<br /><br />While you discuss the prices of cocaine in the US, spare a thought for the Australians. $300+ a gram is not uncommon here and it&#039;s usually not the best quality.

				In our area of the uk, shit coke is £30 on the street, half decent £50, decent peruvian flake £80,<br />So roughly similar to SR prices, I have seen a gram of £115ish coke from here and it was very good, probably 80%+ purity. Depends what your looking for, if your going to spend £30 on a gram of shit coke you would be better off spending £30 on 2 grams of high quality M-cat, which seems to be the drug of choice these days around here, available everywhere cheaply, although the quality is starting to slip now.

				When I see prices up to $170 a gram thats when I feel the same as the OP. In reality, even coke straight from Peru or whatever south american country has inpurities in it. Allot of dealers have access to knowledge on how to purify it with acetone and other chemicals. Which works. This is only profitable to coke dealers that have a good connection where purity is above 75%-80%. Its not uncommon to pay up to 80-120 a gram on the street for acetone washed fish scale. <br /><br />Cocaine is not a drug meant for someone whos pinching pennies.&nbsp; Im not saying you are. Just saying that pure cocaine is marketed to wall street and hollywood douche bags. Thats why the price is so high, and thats why the crack cocaine market exists.

				The rise in cocaine prices is down to the fact that its a sellers market due to the product being illegal!<br /><br />Cocaine use is speading all over the world as more nations develop into a state in which many have money to spend on recreation.<br /><br />If cocaine was legal, we would see prices perhaps stay the same-ish. But, it would actually be cocaine and I would pay 100 UK plus for a gram of cocaine and think its a fair price and one that keeps coke &#039;special&#039;.<br /><br />If coke was $10 per gram, we would see a LOT of cokeheads!<br /><br />As much as I like a little dabble in coke I don&#039;t like full time cokeheads who, to be frank, are usually divorced and usually a bloody nuisence if they corner you in the local pub.<br /><br />Recreational coke us us fine. <br /><br />I&#039;d keep the price high which would do many a favour as coke IS addictive.<br /><br />We would make billions in revenue if we legalised coke like it used to be.<br /><br />And if anyone was dumb enough to inject a gram of really pure cocaine, that is similar to people who drink a bottle of whiskey or two and walk along a canal path.<br /><br />One last thing, I&#039;d hate to snort aline of coke in the morning. In work we banned it because we talk enough shit smoking hash and bud.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />We leave coke for weekends only and special occasions.
