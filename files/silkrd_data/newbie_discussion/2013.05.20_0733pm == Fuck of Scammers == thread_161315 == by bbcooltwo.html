				Thanks to all of you scammers.<br />I ´m watching the silkroad market since&nbsp; some years, never order on myself, i ordered about some other users, so i have never made experience on my self with a direct buy.<br />So after so long time i decide to order on my self, but now it´s very difficult to do this, because nobody or only a few people trust you.<br />Every on of us want to get great stuff and make money with it, we are all some outlaws, criminel , but why we have to steel each other the things/money?<br />Such people destroy this beautiful market and that even escrow is working...<br />I really&nbsp; hope the things get better !<br /><br />Much success to all of you honest vendors!

				Yes,<br />i made the experience, that i asked the seller before, if its ok to buy and so on. To take informations from him.<br />So i placed the order and he tell me to FE,<br />i told i have to think about it, because i read that some packages get loosed.<br />So he cancelled the order and told me i can think about and replace it, if i am agree with FE, so i have done this.<br />Few hours later i get an message that the order is cancelled, because scammers go around in my area/the area where the order is send to.<br /><br />So only because i diddn ´t make an order on my self since now and had to make a new account beacuse i forgotten my transfer pin, i have bad chances to make an order.<br /><br />Sorry for my bad english, i hope you understand me.<br />

				Thank you for understanding ;) !<br />No, he wasn´t the only one, but the only one with this good prices.<br />So i had try about another vendor, he accept me today, didn´t asked about FE and the progress of the order is : in transit.<br />So i hope the best, that are not only a few euros.

				Now that you said this I remember when I was looking the other day the only vendor with this great wax, needed you to have like $1000+ spent and 10+ orders or you have to FE<br /><br />So sucks, why are the vendors with the best prices and stuff getting all FE crazy, is it only because people keep scamming them?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				OK, so I just started as well, so take my experience for what it&#039;s worth. I have placed 1 order and was not asked to FE and my order is being shipped. I contacted another vendor when I was afraid that it wasn&#039;t going to ship and they said &quot;anything under $1000.&quot; I&#039;m not trying to call you out or anything, but you might want to try spending a little time looking through the listings and at profile pages. It seems that most vendors will tell you upfront what to expect. You have to click on their name to see this page. I dunno/ I could be wrong, but I will NEVER, EVER FE with a new vendor, or order from a vendor that requires it. Just my two cents.

				I think this will be some ground for the FE.<br />And maybe some vendors haven´t big money in the bag and have to work with the money maybe.<br />I didn´t know it 100 %.<br />I hope i can make 5 clean deals for the beginning to be accepted there.<br /><br />I am seller for weed in some little boards, and i know what it is to make this buissniss and i am not the one who works against this big community.

				hello bbcooltwo and congrats on jumping in and making your first purchase<br />thanks for your input and i agree with you, people scamming vendors and vendors scamming buyers is horse shit. it ruins it for everyone else who just want to buy and sell professionally. following SR guidelines helps ensure safety for buyers and sellers as much as possible. if you are a new buyer and really want to purchase off a specific vendor who requires FE, ask if you can stay in escrow but pay for tracked shipping. the buyer will have proof that the package was delivered incase of a dispute and doesn&#039;t have to worry about loosing him money and you will have security knowing the package was shipped. the one exception is if your ordering international, sometimes tracking requires a signature and i personally would never sign for anything but it works great for domestic orders with vendors who are weary about your stats.
