				Hi there, <br /><br />new user here, sorry I can&#039;t post this in the right forum...<br />I signed up with SR a few weeks ago and last night I was ready to try my first purchase. I&#039;m on holiday right now so I was looking to score some quality weed over here 8)<br />So I bought a small amount of BTC (around 50€) and started doing my laundry. I sent the BTC around a little bit and finally ended up with them in an instawallet account. I waited for the 20 minute waiting period to be over and then sent the BTC to my SR wallet immediately.<br />The site confirmed that the transaction was done and my instawallet balance went to zero. <br />This was 17 hours ago and neither does the amount show up in my SR wallet nor is the transaction visible on blockchain, blockexplorer etc.<br />The last thing I can see is the transfer to instawallet. When I check my SR wallet on blockchain it only says that this is a new account that has never been used before. No transaction as well.<br />Maybe I&#039;m getting this whole thing wrong, but shouldn&#039;t the transaction at least be visible as unconfirmed?<br />I tried contacting the instawallet support but no response yet (I did NOT mention SR, of course).<br /><br />I&#039;m freaking the hell out right now and need some people to tell me wether this is normal or not.<br /><br />Cheers, <br />Wurstsuppenruderer<br /><br />P.S. Yes, I am positive that I sent the BTC to the right address (copy &amp; paste, double checked)<br />

				Thank you for your replies so far! <br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a point in contacting SR support right now because the FAQ says: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It can take up to 6 hours for a deposit to be confirmed on the blockchain, processed, and credited to your Silk Road account. If your deposit still hasn&#039;t shown up, first check that it is showing up on the blockchain by searching for your deposit address on a site like blockchain.info. If your transfer doesn&#039;t appear here, then it was never sent and you need to find out why from the person or organization who initiated the transfer.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Has anyone else experienced waiting periods that long on instawallet?<br /><br /><br />UPDATE: The transaction has just turned up on blockchain with already 7 confirmations! Seems like this is going the right way.<br />I&#039;ll keep this thread updated.

				Sounds like you&#039;ll be fine, it&#039;s just a waiting game. <br /><br />I did an anonymous/send shared transfer out of Blockchain and it took at least 12 hours before the destination wallet received the funds. <br /><br />It understand it can be a bit nerve-wracking, especially if you&#039;re in a hurry to get those BCT into SR!

				that&#039;s usually the route i go also<br />and it will take a long while<br />did you get the notification saying your BTC was spendable with instawallet?<br />instawallet makes you wait a little when your coins are first transferred into your wallet before you can transfer to SR

				BTC for 50€ ;)<br />I wish I had 50BTC just to spend on drugs. But on a second thought that would most likely end up in coke addiction, so it&#039;s better that I don&#039;t...

				Download a copy of Bitcoin - QT. It&#039;s a bitcoin wallet that resides on your computer instead of some server somewhere. I use it all the time.

				Update after 34 hours: My money is still stuck in virtual nirvana...<br />Instawallet seems to have some major problems, but they state that the wallets there have not been compromised. They are moving around HUGE amounts of BTC. Even if this turns out good, i will never ever use their service again.<br /><br />See this thread on bitcointalk for more information:<br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=164143.0

				I figured out that my money didn&#039;t go to SR but in their big pot of BTC.&nbsp; Apparently they transfered their whole cold storage to a new wallet (1LrPYjto3hsLzWJNstghuwdrQXB96KbrCy) . Really don&#039;t know what to think about this. <br />The admins state on bitoin-central -which is somehow involved with instawallet- that they have full control over that wallet. <br />So I hope nothing got lost and I&#039;m really curious how this is gonna come out.

				Update: Instawallet has been hacked!<br /><br />They just posted the message below on their website. There seems to be a chance to get my money back.

				Instead of using instawallet to send coins etc I offer bitcoins straight into your silk road account (almost instant) for cash in the post. Depending on your buyer stats I would even send you half the btc before you send me the cash :)

				Thanks for your offer, but I definitely won&#039;t do that. Too risky scam-wise, no offense. <br />This whole instawallet thing was just a classic case of &quot;wrong time, wrong place&quot;. I would never store bitcoins there, it was just one station among many others.
