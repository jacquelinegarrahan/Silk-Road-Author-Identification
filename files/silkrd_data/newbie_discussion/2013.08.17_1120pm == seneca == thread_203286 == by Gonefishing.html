				Trying to find a source for H closer to home without paying insane local prices ,I have yet to receive product but this guy is on top of it in terms of his customer service , its rare in my experience to find a vendor with his stats who still takes the time to answer questions and seem genuine .<br />I have looked over his stats and they are great I contacted him in hopes that he would ship north to Canada I assume all the risk and FE but he seems committed to actually getting the product to me cares about packaging correctly etc .<br /><br />Can anyone comment in detail about his gear ? the Afghani ? and the Pure&nbsp; tar Heroin ?<br /><br />GF

				Ah secena.&nbsp; He&#039;s been selling that cheap H on the road ever since I joined.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen him selling &quot;Afghan Brown&quot; before though.&nbsp; From the reviews on it, people are saying it&#039;s gunpowder black tar rather than real #4.&nbsp; He&#039;s been selling tar for a long time though and everyone says it&#039;s pretty low quality and his &quot;the pure&quot; isn&#039;t much better.&nbsp; If you have a really low tolerance, it might work for you but IMO you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the vendor &quot;Purest&quot; before for tar and it was pretty good.&nbsp; I prefer #4 though.&nbsp; I&#039;m waiting on an order from Dragoncove at the moment.&nbsp; You pay more but it&#039;s worth it.&nbsp; Subsrgood is supposed to be another good vendor though he may require you to FE.&nbsp; The stamp vendors are either hit or miss.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had good luck with DeluxeDelivery but he doesn&#039;t have any listings up at the moment.&nbsp; I would still probably try someone like deezletime before secena though I can&#039;t speak on it first person because I haven&#039;t used either.

				I purchased some pricy tar in the past from &quot;thecompany&quot; I liked the high&nbsp; but they just tossed the tar in a hand written envalope and mailed it lol it took lots 1/4 gram to rocket me up , I have lived in Bc and Amsterdam and I take 400 mg morphine plus diladid scripts daily I have had lots of #3 and #4 Heroin .<br />I am going to try samples of his &quot;pure Tar and powder and see how they affect me , I know my heroin pretty well if its good enough I will take no Morphine or Diladid break through , it will do all the climbing LOL if its weaker I will slam in on top of the morphine .<br /><br />The interesting thing about this so called Afghani he is selling is we have a decent pebble type brown that shows up in BC that sounds exactly like what he describes .<br />Only one way to find out I will try out his gear , with this guys personality (charming Mfer) and his business practice someone needs to invest and get him world class Gear ! <br /><br />GF
