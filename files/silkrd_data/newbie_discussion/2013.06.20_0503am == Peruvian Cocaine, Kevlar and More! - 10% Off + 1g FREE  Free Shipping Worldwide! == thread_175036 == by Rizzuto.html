				Thanks for the sample. It arrived yesterday and today I proceeded to chop it up and try it out. Very hard shiny crystals. I did the entire .15 sample in four small lines- first two then two more after a few minutes. At first it was mild but after the second batch of lines I started to feel the effects. Not as strong as I&#039;d hoped but decent. Thanks again.

				Hey Rizzuto, Greetings from the UK!<br />I&#039;ve voted, my man, on my particular poison...<br /><br />I ordered my sample, of your &quot;posh mans talcum powder&quot;, and i CAN&#039;T WAIT to recieve it, i havent had decent charlie in a LONG time, (can you tell i&#039;ve got high expectations lol)<br />Even though this was a sample, it will be my first parcel to arrive internationally (IF it arrives, but others have received theres, so here&#039;s hoping!)<br />If this arrives, i&#039;ll be ordering your Heroin straight away! (i need to build my confidence on international though) <br /><br />The other thing holding me back, is the delivery time, even though i will be ordering small batches to start, would there be an option to have it fast-tracked, i don&#039;t mind signed for, and obviously i will pay the extra postage costs, but it does mean a risk your end...(CCTV etc)<br /><br />

				Pele I already disputed this with SR Vendor support. Your money is in Escrow I do not have it and I clearly stated to you I ACCIDENTALLY gave the wrong tracking number..I have a courier that drops off all parcels/documents to mailbox. Remember you never even reimbursed me for shipping you insisted on 10% off and you wanted me to include extra weight AND you tried to get free shipping you are very greedy Australia has crazy prices.
