				There&#039;s a lot of topics involving posting spam to get to 50 posts. But that seems like a waste of bandwidth. So instead let&#039;s have some intelligent discussion to get to 50 posts.<br /><br />Did you guys see that the US House of Representatives voted down a bill yesterday that would have defunded the NSA? It was a really close vote too, 205-217. Here&#039;s a CLEARNET article: http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/justin-amash-nsa-amendment-94716.html<br /><br />My hope is that the vote is close enough to spark some more discussion on the NSA. Similarly, you should look up how your local Congressman voted on this bill, and if they voted against it, give them a call. Your government is supposed to listen to you!

				I seriously doubt we will ever get rid of the NSA, But if we do, you can bet it will be replaced with something else. I hope they aren&#039;t reading this...

				The NSA will probably exist regardless, but taking away its power to spy on American citizens would be nice.<br /><br />Drugs are pretty cool I guess. I&#039;m mainly in it to get mail so I can pretend friends are mailing me stuff.

				Yeah, I believe it&#039;s pronounced &quot;meth-alone.&quot;<br /><br />Here&#039;s a new topic for discussion. Let&#039;s say you magically acquired one million Bitcoins, which by current conversions is about $95 million USD. What would you do with those Bitcoins? Try to launder it into your country&#039;s local currency? Buy a metric shitload of drugs? Give it away to random people?
