				I made my mtgox account and they need ID verification . After&nbsp; that they will confirm my account within 10 days. After that I need to make bank transfer which may take up to 5 days for the money to appear in my acc. <br /><br />Then I can exchange for some BTC . Is that correct ? <br /><br />If so ... isnt there an option to buy BTC with Debit or Moneybookers ? <br /><br />Also Ive tried to search for a local buyer the closest I found was 600km away from me . So this thing doesnt work for me . Anything else I am missing , like some nice website that offer debit/moneybookers/paypal payment ? <br /><br />Thanks for your kind answers!

				Depending on your area you can just mail cash to someone in exchange for BTC, with the proper precautions taken of course. I did that, and christ, it&#039;s been so much easier.

				What I&#039;ve been using that works well is blockchain.info.&nbsp; They will give you a wallet and the option to make a payment through BitInstant, which allows you to create a payment slip for a merchant(Zip Zap Inc. is mine) to take to moneygram at Wal-mart.&nbsp; At wally world, you just fill out a blue form with the information from your payment slip and within an hour or so, your money will be in your wallet ready to transfer to SR. *Note-I made a deposit on Monday for around $750 USD, and BitInstant is taking there sweet time processing it.&nbsp; Will update if there are any issues unresolved.&nbsp; I have used them 6 times previously and not had a problem till I did a larger amount.&nbsp; Will update*
