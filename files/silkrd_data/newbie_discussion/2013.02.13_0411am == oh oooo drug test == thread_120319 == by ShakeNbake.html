				You should be able to purchase a medicine bottle with counterfeit labels on it.<br /><br />I can&#039;t remember which seller it is, but from the reviews I&#039;ve read, it seems legitimate. It has valid information on the bottle. You can get it back-dated however late you want so if you fail the drug test then you can order it and re-present it afterwards.<br /><br />You can figure out how to search for it on SR, I&#039;m not sure exactly where it was listed.

				There is no surefire method. It depends on s lot of factors. <br /><br />If possible put it off as long as you can. <br /><br />Abstain from use till the test. <br /><br />Flush your system as much as passable by staying hydrated. It does help to exercise regularly. Sports drinks are better than water.<br /><br />Get an otc teasing kit so you can test&nbsp; yourself. If this is for probation or&nbsp; parole and you know you are going to test dirty try further delays. If you can&#039;t delay it then you are always better off &quot; asking for help &quot; than &quot; getting busted &quot;.<br /><br />Sorry to hear you have to go through this. Hope it all works out for you.

				i always hear people asking how to beat a pee test.&nbsp; if possible, the best option is just to abstain until the test is over.&nbsp; so many factors involved.<br /><br />THC is highly fat soluble, so if u are a fattie then chances are u got a lot of fatties stored in your fattie deposits.&nbsp; additionally, if u exercise a day or so before the test u will prob burn some of that fat which will mean the THC will be in ur pee.<br /><br />so best option is to not smoke, exercise a lot up until a few days before test, then eat lots of junk food and be lazy for those last few days.&nbsp; u want your body to hold onto that fat.<br /><br />dont try to water down ur pee, dont try bleach or any of that other stupid shit.&nbsp; if it is a half-decent lab doing the work they will see right past that shit and fail you.&nbsp; even if they dont find drugs, if they feel u tampered, they will fail you.<br /><br />lastly, weed they always say takes a month to get out of system.&nbsp; i disagree.&nbsp; if you smoke a shitload then yeah, but just here and there it will be gone in a week.

				I got a DUI several years ago, and had to go through drug/alcohol therapy as required for the State Diversion program. Along with the BS propaganda like Pot causes infertility and birth defects, drug and alcohol (enzyme ETG) urine analysis were required regularly. After my first couple AA meetings (also required) and finding my &quot;this is utter bullshit!&quot; attitude I did some research and found a (for me at least -caveat) bullet prof way to beat the tests, even for ETG the Alcohol enzyme (Ethylglucuronide) they test for. The ETG test is very sensitive and can detect any Alcohol consumed within 3-4+ days. So here is the deal, first you need at the very least 24-36 hours prior notice or suspicion that you will get a UA (Urine Analysis). In the test the first thing they check for is temperature, then specific gravity and Creatine content. Anyone who tries to water down their piss directly or even by JUST drinking lots of water will fail the Gravity and Creatine tests, and temp is obvious...<br /><br />So follow the following steps in order of success (#1 at least):<br /><br />1.) Don&#039;t drink, smoke or do drugs ;-)<br /><br />2.) At T-36 hours (1 and half days) prior to the test. Start drinking 3 to 3.5 quarts or litters of water per 24 hours (DO NOT DO MORE, as it is unsafe to drink too much water).<br /><br />3.) Start taking a vitamin B-100 Complex every 12 hours (helps to keep the watered down Urine have color and density).<br /><br />4.) Get beforehand and start taking &quot;Creatine monohydrate&quot; Supplement (look it up on Google and you will see it is commonly used by weight lifters, should be available at most vitamin shops on or off-line ), take 3-5 grams per 24 hours. This will get your diluted Piss high enough in Creatine to pass the test! <br /><br />5.) At about 8 hours before your test, take a B-100 vitamin and about 3-5 grams of the Creatine (if you are heavy go with the upper dose) and drink 1-2 litters (quarts) water (without going over 3.5 *4* MAX!! per 24 hours)<br /><br />This helped me pass both Cocaine and Alcohol use up to 24 hours before the test. I have never tested it against Marijuana/THC but it should work since we are &quot;watering&quot; down our Piss and thus *diluting* the offending drug without triggering the usual tests for said Dilution!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />regards,<br /><br />mushmold

				My method is to train. Train hard, &#039;til your sweat covered the ground and lightning shot out of your fingertips. And when done training, eat healthy food, and constantly drink large amounts of water. Not huge amounts of water, that&#039;ll wait until the day before the test. No training the day before the test, since that will free metabolites locked in fat.<br /><br />A friend of mine smoked the two or three days before his drug test, but trained like hell and somehow managed to pass. It is probably relevant that this person had next to no body fat. Being a skeleton is recommended if you want to pass your tests ;)
