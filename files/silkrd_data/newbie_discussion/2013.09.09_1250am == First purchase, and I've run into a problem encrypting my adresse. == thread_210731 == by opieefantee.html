				Hi forum,<br /><br />Using the dealers PGP code I tried encrypting my address but only received an error code. Here it is:<br /><br />not a MPI, bits=2048,len=568<br /><br />Does anyone have experience with this problem or know how to fix it? I do believe it is the dealers PGP code that works but he is a top 4% dealer so is it possible that I&#039;m doing something wrong? I did try using a different PGP code and did not get the error message. After contacting the dealer he told me to either send him the message or use privnote. Has anyone used privnote before, and is it a safe alternative in a situation like this?<br /><br />

				1st, try deleting the vendors public key in your pgp software and re-importing it, then try again. As far as privnote, I used it once, it works , just most vendors don&#039;t like it but your guy seems ok with it. Hell, I made my 1st like 7 orders with no pgp at all, just sent my info. I finally taught myself to use it but I doubt 1 buy without pgp is gonna be an issue.

				Ok, good to know privnote works. <br />Also, if this information helps at all im using <br /><br />http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/PGpubkey.htm<br /><br />to encrypt my messages. I&#039;ve tried it on a PC and a mac and had my friend try to do it for me and it still did not work. The only thing that&#039;s making me think that his PGP SHOULD work is that he is top 4% but I think I may end up using privnote.<br /><br />Would you recommend any other PGP softwares?

				Hi Opiee-<br />I think the isue w/ privnote is tht someone else is doing the encrytpion and therefore it defeats the purpose-<br />I use and recommend gpg4usb- its simple and easy to use and thier mainsite has a great step by step tutorial-<br />so get it and use in the newbie pgp thread for practice

				I use gpg4win, it&#039;s pretty easy to use and it&#039;s free. <br />I wouldn&#039;t use privnote on a regular basis but if your just trying to get an order made this once with it your prolly ok
