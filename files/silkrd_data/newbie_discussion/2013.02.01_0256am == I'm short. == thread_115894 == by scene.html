				I feel like such an idiot. I hate seeing these posts. I&#039;m sorry guys, but I&#039;m $4 short for an order. I deposited $376 using bitcopia (great service btw) and ended up with $339 in my account. Can someone help?

I mean, you could leave it up to luck with the recent BTC value increases, but you&#039;re better off throwing in some more money. For the future, estimate a little high. I wouldn&#039;t want to have a big fat commission fee slapped onto an extra 10 USD that I&#039;m converting because I happened to be short a few BTC.

				These are nice suggestions friends, but I&#039;ve wanted to post something like this before. I&#039;m sure we all understand and we&#039;ve maybe all been here. I&#039;ve bought coins on bitintstant and the rate changed before the transaction completed and I was something like 25 cents short. I didn&#039;t post to borrow, but rather asked the vendor; who offered no assistance. Decided just to buy more coins. In any case, I think this entire system is based on trust and I&#039;d like to think we&#039;re all friends. So, scene, if you would like borrow the $4 and repay it to me the next time you buy coin, send me a PM with an address and I&#039;ll help you out if you still need it.&nbsp; &nbsp;
