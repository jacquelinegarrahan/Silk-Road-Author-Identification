				I&#039;m a new member and I was thinking of buying my first order soon. What are some steps you guys would recommend to keep safe?<br /><br />P.S. What I might buy is nothing more than half an ounce.

				I would have it sent somewhere else i.e a friends house. Obviously someone you can trust. Use a domestic vendor until you are familiar with what your doing. Get btc from localbitcoins.com and use escrow.

				Update Tor<br />Turn off scripts<br />Look for a reputable vendor who does not require FE (should say on their profile, or you can message them)<br />NEVER FE<br />Use your REAL name and REAL address<br />Don&#039;t be paranoid.. you&#039;ll be high soon :D

				Do as much homework as you can before you decide to take the plunge!<br /><br />Since you&#039;re on the forums you clearly understand tor. You should also look into using tails for more security. Use PGP for anything you wouldn&#039;t want LE to read. Practice PGP before ordering, you definitely don&#039;t want to mess that up, because either a. you screw up and sensitive information is out in the open, or b. the seller can not decrypt your information and your purchase can&#039;t go through.<br /><br />This can&#039;t be said enough: NEVER FINALIZE EARLY! No matter how trusted a seller may seem, they can take off with your BTC if you&#039;ve finalized your order. Look into tony76 if you want to read a horror story on FE, moral is just don&#039;t do it. Stay in escrow. If a vendor requires you to finalize, there are plenty others with great products and great stealth and communication willing to work with you.<br /><br />I recommend using localbitcoins to trade with cash, and wash your coins before depositing to SR. Fog is a great service but charges a fee. Another idea I read in the security forum was to create several throwaway wallets, and refresh your identity on tor each time you create, and each time you deposit. Use differing amounts as well, don&#039;t just route all the coins from one to the other. Not sure how well this method works though, don&#039;t know enough about tracing bitcoin to prove one way or the other.<br /><br />The forums are the best place to learn, spend a lot of time here. Not only will you learn tips and tricks for using SR, but you can find a vast wealth of information on vendors and products, such as detailed reviews, as well as very interesting information and debate on various relevant topics. <br /><br />Hope that helps, enjoy your travels.
