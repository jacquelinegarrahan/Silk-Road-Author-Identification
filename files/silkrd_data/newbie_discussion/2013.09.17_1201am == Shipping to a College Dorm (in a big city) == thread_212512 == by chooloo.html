				Hi, extremely new user here with a few questions about shipping to a college dorm. I have not made any shipments so far, but I would like to order some edibles and 1/4 oz of weed and have it sent to my dorm mailbox. I&#039;m posting here to ask the SR forum if it&#039;s a good idea in the first place and what I can do to make the shipment and stealth as good as it can be. I checked all my vendors and they are reputable with rankings within the top 30% and over 300+ transactions. If there&#039;s anything I am missing please let me know! Thanks! (also, the only reason I am seriously considering doing this SR shipment to my dorm is because it&#039;s only a few edibles and a &lt;1 oz shipment of weed. Would never consider a QP of weed or any other drug)

				Weed is a tough one, because of the smell.&nbsp; It&#039;s extremely important to find out how it is packaged as to mask the smell.&nbsp; The &quot;stealth&quot; when it comes to weed is first masking that damn funky odor, with other drugs where smell isnt a factor, its more about concealing it to make it look like the drugs arent there.&nbsp; Try your best to find out beforehand how the parcel will come packaged, and what is done to 1) mask the smell, 2) make it look like theres no weed in there to anyone who opened the package. It can be done though, especially with a small amount like youre getting.&nbsp; Hundreds of pounds of weed are shipped across the country every week lol.

				Thanks for the input guys. Also one more follow up question, do you think it&#039;s smarter to instead of getting the fourth of weed, just get more edibles? I&#039;d imagine the odor from the edibles is much less and they are much harder to detect. It would just look like cookies from grandma or something. Thoughts? Thanks again

				If you go with someone reputable I wouldn&#039;t worry about having buds delivered to your mailbox. <br /><br />Its not as if colleges have a more rigorous screening system. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re not scrutinizing each parcel thinking, &quot;Is this kid getting pot?&quot; and x-raying it. Its probably a poorly paid campus job done by a kid who just wants to get his job done so he can study.<br /><br />If its safe enough for regular mail, it should be safe enough for campus mail too.<br /><br />I get why you&#039;re nervous, you don&#039;t want to get kicked out, but honestly, if you talk to your seller and they have a safe method they use, you&#039;ll be just fine.<br /><br />Good luck and enjoy.<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about something so small.&nbsp; I have express shipped single kilograms to dorms and college boxes without a problem (not weed).

				Thanks for all the input! Makes me feel a lot more confident in ordering off the SR. Last question before I stop pestering you guys though; should I separate my orders or will it be ok to order all of them at the same time? Will it be suspicious that so many anonymous packages are being sent to the same place? (specifically 4 packages from 4 different vendors)

				Separating is never a bad idea.&nbsp; What if something went wrong with the first one, and you had 3 more on the way for them to find? Its good to make sure that one goes through safe, then order the next one. Otherwise order multiple,but do it to different addresses.

				I&#039;d say the more packages you have showing up at one time the greater the chance of there being an issue. <br /><br />Getting one or two packages a week wouldn&#039;t be suspicious. Getting 5-6, might be asking for trouble.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d advise against it if it is YOUR dorm. Try to find a friend who can simply deny it OR ship it to your neighbour and wait for it if you know when it&#039;ll show up.

It&#039;s really dependent on how the dorm the OP lives in works, whether it&#039;s more open concept motel style off-campus or card-key locked typical on-campus housing. As well as the relative security and property oversight. If the OP has a friend who lives in a student-rented house off-campus I&#039;d recommend shipping it there. If the guy runs into any trouble he can just claim he has no idea what it is etc. I know you can do this on-campus or in an off-campus comparable dorm complex to an on-campus one but it does, at least IMHO, give the guy you mail it to less trouble. You&#039;re less likely to get kicked out of school or receive whatever punishment that doesn&#039;t involve the cops if you do this and it&#039;s intercepted. Landlords only give a fuck about money, afterall.
