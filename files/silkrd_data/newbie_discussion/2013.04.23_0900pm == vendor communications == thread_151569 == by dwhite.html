				I created this forum account today because I am looking for feedback. I have done many more than 100 hours of silkroading amounting to 7-10 transactions totaling about 1000 dollars. All in all much more time spent observing/investigating than interacting. In my experiences I have interacted with several vendors through buying products and PM&#039;s asking questions. Some for example &quot;Project4&quot; and &quot;Nod&quot; had both amazing products and just as importantly great communication skills. Then on the other hand there are examples like &quot;Juergen&quot; who seem unrealistically slow to respond. I would like others to chime in with some of their own experiences cocerning vendor communications<br />&nbsp;

				Every vendor I&#039;ve dealt with has been prompt. The slowest was the overseas MDMA vendor but he/she was a very high transaction vendor and still responded within 24 hours. All the domestic vendors I&#039;ve dealt with responded quickly. Current champion of response time was vividvisions who took less than 30 minutes to respond this morning when I messaged him/her. Close second was SilentBob who responded within 2 hours. I can honestly say I haven&#039;t had one negative vendor experience.

				I almost never have to actually PM vendors here and most of the time I can understand the fact that they&#039;re busy people. However I recently ordered a considerable amount (100 tabs) of 25i from goodatbusiness and as his vendor page stated I was expecting 3-4 days processing time. This did not happen. 4 days later I PM him and he replies saying that he was a little behind and would be sending my order that day. Now it is a week since I ordered and still processing but I&#039;ll give him the benefit of the doubt and tell myself it&#039;ll be here eventually.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t want this to sound like a rant because of the AMAZING deal I got (and it might still be going on) so if he or anyone else has anything to add please do.

				I have made 11 transactions so far. I would say I get replies to my messages to vendors about 40% of the time.<br /><br />I appreciate they are busy and may not have the time for my non-life threatening questions. However I have always been polite and constructive.<br /><br />Maybe things will pick up when the SR gets back up to speed. It&#039;s been so laggy the past few days.<br /><br />Maybe I need to flash some more cash to get replies!&nbsp; ;)

				We see communications as essential in a trust marketplace like this.&nbsp; Prompt replies to PM&#039;s (no more than 24 hours in our opinion) suggests a good business rather than just someone with a couple grams trying to make $100.<br /><br />I&#039;d look for &quot;real&quot; vendors big enough to be serious, but small enough to still care.
