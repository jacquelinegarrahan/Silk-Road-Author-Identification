				If one were to buy 1/2 oz and it got identified by USPS (via dogs), what are the odds that it would be handed off and the local PD would do a CD?&nbsp; How about a search?&nbsp; Most of what I have read about arrests and problems involve amounts far larger than &quot;personal use&quot; but I am curious if anyone has stories about people getting popped for a 1/4, 1/2 or something like that.<br /><br />The debate for me is simple:&nbsp; do I ship a smaller amount to my home?&nbsp; or do I ship a larger amount to &quot;someplace else&quot; and standby to pick it up?<br /><br />Risk wise, there are pros and cons to both approaches.&nbsp; &nbsp;ie:&nbsp; do you get your fix in one big shipment?&nbsp; or do you take additional risk over many smaller shipments?

				(Someone please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) Local PD wouldn&#039;t run a CD because it&#039;s a federal crime through a federal service. I very seriously doubt the federal government would waste their time with a half zip of weed. <br /><br />If you are worried make sure you ask questions about stealth, and read the vendors feedback concerning stealth. <br /><br />Never risk sending to anywhere that you do not 100% trust whoever OWNs the property. The idea is to do things to look out of the ordinary. A 1/2 isn&#039;t that big at all, people get QPs through the mail. <br /><br />Think backwards, think from the source and think from the perspective of the post office. Would one big shipment be more or less strange than a machine gun rapid amount of little ones from potentially different sources?

				Do your research regarding vendors that know they&#039;re shit as far as stealth . The good ones really make the risks shrink to almost nothing.

				You bring up a good point between federal and local.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve always understood the process to be&nbsp; dog sniffs --&gt; USPS identifies --&gt; USPS hands it off to local if they aren&#039;t pursuing it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not at all worried about being prosecuted at the federal level.&nbsp; They have bigger fish to fry and would look pretty stupid prosecuting a federal possession-only case for 1/2 oz.&nbsp; &nbsp; However, my local PD would like nothing more than to bust a personal user and put them on the front page of the news.<br /><br />The delivery site is under my complete control so that is not an issue and would actually work against me if the package gets sniffed or a CD gets served.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I would like to know how often sniffs happen and how often they are followed up when they aren&#039;t prosecuted by USPS/Federal.<br /><br />Knowing those two things would be very helpful.&nbsp; &nbsp; The delivery point is under my complete control and its setup to receive any kind and any amount of packages .&nbsp; The *only* way things can get fouled is if the package is identified (sniffed) on the way AND action is taken to follow up on it.<br /><br />Someday, I dream of reading a thread of SR about how to fool drug dogs.&nbsp; &nbsp;As in -- make packages immune to them.

				88fx, I&#039;ve done the research and have ID&#039;ed the vendors I want to do business with.&nbsp; However, nobody had good enough stealth to beat the dogs.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />....or do they?&nbsp; &nbsp;(don&#039;t give names, just &quot;yes it can be done&quot; or &quot;no, the dogs are always an issue)

				Not sure your location, but if U.s. based and ordering domestically, there are plenty of weed packages and even QP&#039;s getting delivered without issue, so it must be working. If per chance your state has decriminalized weed at all, the safest bet would be to stay under that amount in all orders and if possible wait for one order to arrive before placing another order. So then right, if the feds say ah heck 1/2 oz weed isn&#039;t worth messing with, and passes it off to local law enforcement, and your state has decriminalized that amount ... then ... I would think you just get the civil citation. Not ideal, but far far far better than getting arrested.<br /><br />Though I have heard if the return address on the package is one of interest to the feds they may lean on you for info which may include an arrest then, since right, at the federal level any amount is unacceptable.

				I am domestic but not in a place that is friendly to weed.&nbsp; I dream of being in a more friendly state and I assure you, I wouldn&#039;t be having this discussion on SR if I were.&nbsp; I&#039;d already be hooked up!<br /><br />Thanks for the link to the postal inspector guy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read that from cover to cover already but will re-read it again to see if I missed any good nuggets last time.<br /><br />I understand some people are shipping QPs and HPs but all you have to do is read the news to see that it doesn&#039;t always go right.&nbsp; Unless we can ascertain that vendors can ship 100% undetectably by dogs, then it&#039;s always going to be a game of chance.&nbsp; Is the dog working today or not?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I matter enough if they do find it or will they move on to other fish?<br /><br />

				hmm i would have a hard time seeing anything happening because of a half oz.. are there love letters written for domestic shipments that are seized or is that just an international package issue?
