				Anyone here every try mephedrone aka 4-mmc aka 4-methylmethcathinon aka meph aka meow meow!? Its my favorite drug in the world! I first had it when it was legal in the US and sold at my local smoke shop and now that i found SR ive found even better . cleaner stuff! Its is an amazing euphork and stimulating experience! Ive tried sonicdrone and Limetless&#039; mephedrone so far and while both are gread I think I prefer Limetless ultra crystal more but i dont know why. Anyone else here have experience with mephedrone?

				Yeah, stimulants are my thing.&nbsp; They&#039;re the only drugs I actually enjoy.&nbsp; I mean oxys feel awesome and all, but it&#039;s just not my thing.&nbsp; I try every stimulant I can get my hands on.&nbsp; Frankly, I don&#039;t see the big deal with cats.&nbsp; They work, sure, and I guess I can see how you might prefer them to speed if you&#039;re looking to go out and have a good time... but they leave me too scattered.&nbsp; Amphetamine lets me think clearly and focus my thoughts.&nbsp; Cat just kind of makes me wanna talk real quick and party or something.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Same deal with MDPV.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t see what the big deal is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had .5g of the stuff for like two weeks and it&#039;s barely even half gone.&nbsp; Most fiendish substance on the planet my fucking ass...<br />&nbsp;

				Hi everyone, I wanna give a little feedback on Limetless UC mephedrone for anyone who is curious, collecting data and thinking about ordering some meph from the Road. The service, communication was perfect, the shipment took 3 days so perfect, and the second took about 17 days. The product was both times a little overweight so that is very pleasing! The packaging was ok, I saw better, but his was honestly all right. When it comes to the product quality it was ok. I didn’t try anyone else on the Road yet so I can really compare to the quality on SR, but I can say what I think when comparing to pre ban or the meph I can get “on the street” after the ban. When compared to the shit sold today Lims stuff IS BETTER! You get euphoria, you get the mephedrone high feeling and the horneyness BUT JUST FOR A SHORT WHILE - what disappointed me was that his meph was losing its potency after redosing. When I did around 0,6g every other line didn’t gave a difference, I was getting low on this euphoria feeling not higher which just made me frustrated. And from what I remember it wasn’t the case with the pre-ban meph. For me that was the main difference (every line got me fucking higher and higher all night long) and main advantage of mephedrone over many now legal cathoines that aspire to replace good old meph. I am not an expert on mepherdone , I did more or less 10 g when it was legal, so maybe the effect of “getting low’ it is my subjective perspective (I don’t have enough experience maybe) or the tolerance was building (but I didn’t had that with the old meph- but again, maybe that is subjective or I had too little experience), but anyways that is what for me was missing in Lim meph, and it is a very important quality for me, it does most of the magic. <br /><br />So now I am going to try Wertu stuff. It sure smells very fucking good, I mean it just fucking stinks! Seriously, I don’t remember old meph stinking like that. But it sure looks weird – the powder is blue ! and his mephedrone rocks – I mean it really looks like rocks, almost MDMAlike, unlike the old meph I guess, which looked rice-like or sugar-like. Well I am not an expert&nbsp; as you can see, just speculating on the basis of my experience (just 10 g of preban - so a little). It would be great to test some of those vendors stuff in a lab somewhere, unfortunately I don’t have this option.<br />
