				I was speaking with a friend last night about BTC and SR and he mentioned he is sending coins to SR direct from the BTC wallet attached to the purchasing platform: from purchase to wallet to SR. My understanding is it is better to move coins to a intermediary wallet, registered and used in Tor only, and then transfer to SR. His view is that as the quantities are small (1-2 coins at a time) and as he is not a vendor he doesn&#039;t have much to worry about. I think this is likely true, but if SR is hacked the hacker(s) would be able to see any account and BTC and product transactions in and out. If the hackers are LE affiliated it would then be possible to trace the BTC transaction back to the original wallet and the real bank account used for the original purchase ... if I&#039;m getting this right, should SR be compromised the entire BTC chain could be identified.<br /><br />Am I correct in assuming this (my friend thinks I&#039;m a bit paranoid)?

				Hacked? Not happening. Better chance of the servers being found. A single intermediate wallet wouldn&#039;t make a difference in the hypothetical situation you are speaking of. A mixing service would change things. You&#039;re paranoid.

				And what about this method:<br /><br />I am buying Coins from any bitcoin site with real bank account, and then i am sending them to bitcoinfrog, afterwards to my offline wallet and then onto the road. With this method i should not be worried at all or? (I am a small / medium buyer and live in a small country within the EU)
