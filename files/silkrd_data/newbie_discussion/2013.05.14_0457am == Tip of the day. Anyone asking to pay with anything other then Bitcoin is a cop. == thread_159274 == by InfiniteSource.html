				Not true I actual emailed a vendor to see if I could do it yesterday lol I know I&#039;m a noob but I am currently not on sr yet and will be getting tor and bitcoins this week. It can&#039;t hurt to ask. The vendor very politely told me he only accept bitcoins and I plan to buy from him once I get my account set up and buy some coins.

I wouldn&#039;t even do that for legal services, much less anything on SR.<br /><br />I would have to agree with InfiniteSource here. If you&#039;ve made it to SR, you&#039;ve been on the internet for more than a day I should hope... and if you&#039;ve been on the internet for more than a day and you were LOOKING for something like SR, you would have undoubtedly hit a news site. There aren&#039;t many days when paypal isn&#039;t in the headlines for doing something bad. They have complete non-mediated control over your money that you have with them - if they think you sent a penny in the wrong direction they&#039;ll hold everything until you forget about it, all the while it sits in their unified bank account adding to their interest pool.<br /><br />Even if they aren&#039;t a cop, they didn&#039;t pass the &quot;you must think this much before using this site&quot; height measurement.<br /><br />And that&#039;s besides the fact that they&#039;re a federally reporting company.
