				From what I&#039;ve seen a lot of things seem to be all over street prices.&nbsp; The big advantage appears to be the consistent high-quality product that appears to be available from the trusted vendors.

				Yeah, I guess you got a point there.&nbsp; It&#039;s not always consistent nor reliable in the Real World.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t imagine ever payin $150 for a gram of blow, or $200 for a G of DMT is all.&nbsp; But this place is always here when you need it i suppose.

				I agree, on reason i dont buy from SR is that there are not any good deals. Being from major US city i can get plenty of drugs for about the same price. But! SR seems to be more for people who live in areas where its hard to get drugs and for them the prices on SR would be very far. The only real value ive seen on SR is La Fuente and because of it he is all ways drowning in orders.

				Double danny666.<br />In my location you could get some kind of chemical bullshit instead of hash for LARGER price than from SR. RC sellers use clearnet forums as a marketplace - how can I trust them? For me and my friends SR is a &quot;Klondike&quot;, but, of course, these prices couldn&#039;t impress dudes from Netherlands or Czech Republic.

				SR is good for LSD, mdma, K and a few other less easy to obtain substances. <br /><br />What its not good for is Blow, RX stuff and IMO heroin. <br /><br />The Road has its pros and cons, like anything else in life. Take it for what it is. If you have the means to crush the competition with your great numbers, by all means. <br /><br />If I wasnt so jamd up IRL on my bills, I would use my network to do just that. Set up shop, and crush all the competition with top shelf gear, at rock bottom prices. Though ive heard many instances of established sellers trying to strong arm their competition into&nbsp; adjusting their prices according to those of all the other vendors. Such nonsense.

				Here are a few reasons:<br />- SR charges a fee on every order (5-10% depending on the goods I believe)<br />- Packaging items takes up time: Time is money<br />- If packages get seized through postal/customs your out your product<br />- Time consumed answering PMs, creating item descriptions etc etc.<br /><br />Its much easier to deal in RL, as you spend a lot less time per deal, but overall the personal risk decrease+extra cash makes up for the time spent.

				I think prices in SR are comparable to street prices, at least where I live. One of the main benefits from SR is that for substances sold by the weight, sellers usually provide the full amount. I&#039;ve gotten shortchanged a few times from street sellers!<br /><br />I&#039;ve found quality on SR usually good, but not necessarily the best, despite buying from vendors with positive reviews. I have been able to buy better quality stuff locally.<br /><br />But the convenience of shopping online of SR is unbeatable!

				Couple of crap experiences of buying pills in clubs that just left me with a nagging sense of disappointment that spoiled the dancing pointed me towards the Road, and the quality/price ratio I have encountered has been great.

				Depends what street you live on, bro. Lately, I&#039;ve been getting $250 halves of what can only be described as a low-mid-grade(?) i guess. It isn&#039;t mexi-brick and smells like dank. It&#039;s my only hook-up and I&#039;m in my 30s now. That makes it hard to connect. It makes about 2-3 bags in my volcano with almost completely transparent vapor. It gets me high, for a few minutes. So, no, for me, not overpriced. I could flip a $300 oz for double (or triple, sold by the g) if I wanted to, here. Last year, I came across some true, sticky, White Rhino and paid through the nose at $35/g. It was worth every penny to me, at the time. I wish I&#039;d heard about SR a LOOOONG time ago. Waiting for my cherry-poppin&#039; order right now. Purple Diesel, can&#039;t wait.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m not sure what RC I ate when it was presented to me as acid (well, I KNOW I ate a sweet tart with a glob of something on it). My guy was CERTAINLY not vetted by the avengers, rofl. Yes, I had a bad time. Real acid, I had a GREEEAT time.

I think you are right about location too. Where I&#039;m from I can get an OZ. of REALLY good weed for as low as $100, and on the road I&#039;ve seen 1/4OZ. go for $100. Needless to say, where I&#039;m from there is a plethora of really good herb! I usually don&#039;t even pay for it anymore! Now coke and pills that&#039;s a different story. My friend and I split an 8-ball a couple weeks ago, and it ran us $280. That&#039;s spendy compared to what we paid a couple years ago, but it&#039;s no fuckin $150 a gram. That&#039;s just&nbsp; WAY too expensive. Don&#039;t ever pay that much!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />ChinoCat

				OK, I just looked at the blow prices. Although, I haven&#039;t had that stuff since 2002 or so. Much inflation since then. Looks like I won&#039;t be doing any yay in the near future. Er, maybe. I might get ONE overpriced bag. Fuck me, I&#039;m like a kid in a fucking toy store here. No heroin, though. EVER. I just don&#039;t trust myself to touch that stuff.

				Ta MisterMcfeely! One day I&#039;ll write a novel....<br /><br />Different strokes for different folks, y&#039;all, but if you stop and think about COST as against PRICE, SR wins hands down for most buyers I think. How much time, effort, and incidental expenses are you accruing trying to get a better deal than the best prices on SR? Although that searching and connecting stuff used to be exciting, it&#039;s tired for me now. But I appreciate everyone&#039;s circumstances are different.<br /><br />Anyway, hope y&#039;all get what you want, I&#039;m gonna finish this glass of red and go to bed now.<br /><br />Take care.
