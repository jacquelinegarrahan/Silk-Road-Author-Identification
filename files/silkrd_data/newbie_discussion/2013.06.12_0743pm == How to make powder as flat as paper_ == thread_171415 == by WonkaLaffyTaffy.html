				How would one package about a gram of powder like DMT so that it is as flat as paper? The idea being that it would not feal like bump in an envelope. How do you get the air out while retaining the flat shape and not suck any powder out?<br /><br />What if the powder is super valuable like LSD, how do you get it flat without losing any or contaminating the outside?

				Well theoretically your customers could drop the paper back into a larger volume of solvent, remove paper and evap the solvent and they have 90% of the original product. But customers are pretty lazy..<br /><br />But yeah I&#039;ve heard that one way people do this is to basically break up rocks so its as much a powder as possible, distribute the powder into several 1x1 inch bags. spread as thin as possible, then using strong tape, tape down each bag onto a thick piece of paper, place small tape rolls AROUND the perimeter of the bags, and fold the piece of paper. This is in case a bag gets knocked loose in transit it wont slide to the other side of the envelope. Stick in birthday card, then in envelope. Seal, then put a piece of tape to &quot;make sure&quot;. Then either put in mail box (kinda risky as postal service will throw your shit around and if it tears they might have to fix it maybe even by taking the contents and putting into a new envelope. Bad. Thats why I would almost recommend sending a slightly larger envelope with the card and some sort of cheap &quot;gift&quot;. Then if that envelope/package gets messed up they gona take out your inner envelope and your gift and place into a new package.<br /><br />Only thing I would be worried about is that DMT is some stinky shit. Maybe you could vacuum seal the thick piece of paper and maybe if u do it carefully with pressure on top of the bags to keep the vacuum seal from compressing/bending. The only thing is this is harder to fit in an envelope, but if u go with the envelope in a package idea than no one even seeing the &quot;suspiciously&quot; thick envelope unless your first package goes gets messed up. I think that without a vacuum sealed bag, you could fit 9 grams or so spread out over the envelope pretty easy.<br /><br />Also if you moving tiny amounts of powders around and around you going to lose tiny amounts. Btw DMT especially if its made poorly/oily can basically get absorbed into the paper. Parchment paper though is fucking awesome for non sticking. But its pretty thin.
