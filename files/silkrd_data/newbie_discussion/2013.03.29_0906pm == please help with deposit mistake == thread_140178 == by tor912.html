				Hey there friend,<br />&nbsp;Thought I would stop by and give a bit of advise. No matter the way in which you decide to fund your coins, you are always going to have to decide how to get them to your SR wallet. In my opinion, sending them from your blockchain wallet to your SR account really isnt a terrible thing. BUT, this opinion varies between others. If you want to feel safe and more secure, it is a simple thing to use BitCoin Fog. It is also easy to create more than one wallet and move your coins through them all and then to your SR address. Just to mix it up. I choose to use the fog option. It doesnt cost very much, 1-3%. I put my coins in, they get tossed around with other coins, then in random amounts and at random times they are deposited to the address I specify(SR) over an 8 hour period. I set this up the night before I want to make a purchase, and by the next morning when I wake up...walla...my coins are there in my SR account. Washed clean, safe and sound, ready to spend. I hope this helps....here is the link for Bitcoin Fog<br /><br />fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion
