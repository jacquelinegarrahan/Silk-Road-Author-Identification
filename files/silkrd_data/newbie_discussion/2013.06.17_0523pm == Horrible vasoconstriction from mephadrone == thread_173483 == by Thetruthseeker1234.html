				Hello all, I need some advice on a situation. <br />Ill start by saying I personally love mephadrone and have never experienced any negative effect from taking it.<br /><br />My friend and I dosed a few days ago. It was his first time. Since then he has had off coloration in his body parts, severe pain, anxiety, fucked up emotions, randomly blurred vision, brain fog, and dizzyness.<br />He keeps freaking out telling me he feels he is going to die. Also he fears that he is going to loose one of his limbs. I have told him over and over that this will go away, but he does not believe me. It has been non-stop since five hours after dosing.<br /><br />I need some second opinions. Should he be going to the hospital? I keep telling him no because it is a waste of money with no insurance and that it will go away on its own. He dosed 350mg only.<br /><br />Please anyone with experience or knowledge about this help. I would really hate for him to waste all the money of hospital fee&#039;s for nothing.<br />Thanks

				I have no experience and not much knowledge on meph, but all that i have read about the stuff, points to it being quite dangerous, and bit of a gamble with your health and safety. <br /><br />I hope your friend turns out ok.

				How much and how was it ingested? I can say the stuff is pretty rough if you are someone who&#039;s body reacts that way. I tried the stuff a few years back when it was legal and had a similar experience with out the blue limbs , but the panic attacks and the feeling of my heart jumping out of my chest lasted for a few days - the stuff did horrible damage to my nose and seemed to have a half life in my system for days. I have read if you bomb it it may be less caustic but I really have no intention of finding out. Another one I have taken off my list. Seems this stuff really reacts differently in individuals because I have read so many reports of people saying the stuff is the best.&nbsp;

				So fucked up that you wouldn&#039;t go to hospital purely because of the insurance situation.<br /><br />In my opinion, if this has been going on for days, then yes, this is worth a trip to hospital.

				You can try&nbsp; to shoot Limitless a PM and ask if he has time to help you. I know he is experienced with that stuff.

				If those symptoms continue much longer I wouldn&#039;t be holding off going to the doctor.<br /><br />I was using that stuff for a couple of months every weekend, it started out great but as the consecutive weekly usage went on it started really fucking with my girlfriend&#039;s and my head. Crazy mood swings, paranoia and anxiety that just kept getting worse. We thought we were going crazy until we connected it with the meph. Never again.

				You&#039;d think with the amount of meph sold on the road, road members would know more. People have said they experienced similar problems, but it always goes away. If this is the case and it will go away on its own, then what is the point of wasting the time and money at the hospital?

				I&#039;ve had quite bad vasoconstriction a few times from a 2-3 gram meph binge before but it never stayed, always dissapeared after a while, maybe a trip to the hospital would be a good idea if it doesn&#039;t change in a few days!

				We have decided to wait 5 more days. If the problems still persist then hospital. Thanks guys for your advice and help
