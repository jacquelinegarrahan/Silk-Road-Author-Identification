				As a SR newbie, I made the mistake of ordering from a vendor without doing research first. I&#039;ve had no bad experience with LucyDrop, but after reading about the recent problems he is having with both super-slow delivery time and very weak LSD I have decided to cancel my order. <br /><br />So, since it&#039;s stuck in the &quot;processing&quot; state, I decided to wait the 4 days and hopefully I could easily cancel at that time. <br /><br />Today, I decided to check my order, and the cancel button was highlighted (allowing me to use it)! Early this morning, it had said &quot;3 days left to cancel). So since cancel was available now for some strange reason, I canceled, and now the bitcoins are back in my SR account.<br /><br />I did send him an email asking him to cancel early, but it is marked &quot;UNREAD&quot;. So I don&#039;t think he saw it, unless he only saw the subject and allowed me to cancel early. Also, looking lucydrop&#039;s page, it says &quot;was last seen: 3 days ago&quot;, so I don&#039;t think he even logged in.<br /><br />Does anyone know how I was able to cancel early? Did SR unlock all of Lucydrop&#039;s orders for early cancellation? I&#039;m not complaining, only curious :-)<br /><br />I&#039;ve since re-ordered with Tessellated. <br /><br />Spread the Love!<br /><br />- Bitfrost<br />

				I know that the staff is looking into LucyDrop&#039;s vendor account and vending activities ... so it&#039;s very possible that that prompted the cancellation.&nbsp; Glad you were able to get that done and get your bitcoins back!!!

				Thanks guys for the info about him being gone now. That makes sense, looking at his page, I see there are no listings now. <br />
