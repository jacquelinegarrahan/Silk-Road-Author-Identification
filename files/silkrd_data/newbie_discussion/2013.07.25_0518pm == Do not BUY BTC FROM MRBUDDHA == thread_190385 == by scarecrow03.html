				Wow this sucks. I used MrBuddha twice for $300 &gt; MP BTC successfully in under 12 hours. My guess is he was building a rep to make a quick grab and go. If he burned say 20 people at once Im sure he skated with at least $5k USD. TERRIBLE.<br /><br />Other than using services like CampBx or Bitinstant how else does everyone get their coins?<br /><br />EDIT: a word

				I&#039;m a fucking idiot.<br /><br />I placed an order with GGatz the moment he decided to turn scammer. I was able to cancel my order after 4 days, presumably before he got the chance to empty my MP and run. He canceled everyone elses orders himself, as soon as he took their money.<br /><br />So I said, maybe there&#039;s something still left on this card. Placed an order with Mrbuddha. Decided hey, fuck it, what&#039;s the worst that could happen? Might as well at least give it a try, or I have this useless Moneypak sitting around unused. And of course, a day later, he cancels my order and makes off with everyones money. <br /><br />What are the fucking odds that both of these vendors would turn scammer the moment I decide to place an order with them? That&#039;s my luck. My stupidity as well, I suppose. It&#039;d honestly be funny if I could actually afford to lose the money, and I wasn&#039;t about to be so fucking dopesick that I&#039;d rather fucking kill myself than feel like this. I just can&#039;t do it. It&#039;s one thing when you have money to burn and you&#039;re just looking to get high, it&#039;s another thing entirely when you really fucking need it. I don&#039;t believe in karma, but I hope these two assholes get what&#039;s coming to them.

				It would never occur to me to buy BTC from someone calling themselves Mrbuddha.&nbsp; Drugs sure but not btc. Small consolation at present but this is a lesson you will never forget (hate learning the hard way)

				It&#039;s got nothing to do with his name. He had 15 PAGES OF &quot;5 OF 5&quot; RATINGS, I&#039;m sorry but no one could have seen that he was a scammer. I lost money on him too, but after doing some research on what happened there seems to be a couple of other very reputable dealers that all went rogue this week. <br /><br />My theory: They are all the same guy.... I laugh at the estimates I see (~5K). Before he closed his vendor page the day that he turned scammer (7/22/13) there were multiple reviews saying that he had not come through on their orders of greater than $5000 in MPs or BTCs (there was one of $10200). THIS GUY WAS DOING THAT ACROSS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS. Not including all the people who have not come forward, this guy walked away with &gt; $60000, I guarantee it. I really think that is a conservative estimate too. <br /><br />It was one hell of a scam on his end. It took 6 months of work to build a reputation and then the big orders starting coming in.... then he sends out the story about his family emergency we all received and he was never to be seen again.
