				i strongly suggest NOT to crack your neighbors WIFI to surf the silkroad. it doesn&#039;t make anything safer, in fact using cracked wifi just adds more risk. read up the security guides here and use your own or public wifi.<br /><br />cheers

				How would using a cracked Wifi lead to increased risk? It is a pain in the ass to go to a public wifi every time I want to use the road. I have been playing with air crack but am curious about other programs.I know the user could see a foreign connection but how many people actually know how to browse their router configs?If I was in a city with an expanded signal range I could potentially access many connections. Would spoofing the MAC address of the hacked connection increase safety? then using TOR? Or should I get some random VPN also?

				You want to not just crack the access password, but try the same password on it&#039;s admin page. Use it to disable logging on the router.<br /><br />Also setup your OS to choose a different MAC address each time.<br /><br />If you are disabling logging on the router and altering your MAC address then an opponent would need to be watching the network at the time of connection to find you, which is unlikely.

				Hmm this could be useful info if someone could provide some help. So what, do I just look for script kiddie tool packs on torrent sites or something and use those, click and done?

				Any script kiddie can crack wifi because all you need to do is google &quot;how to crack wifi&quot; and it tells you how. There are countless guides out there, nobody is going to create another one just for this forum.<br /><br />Get a Backtrack 5 live USB stick, it will have all the tools needed.

				I realize I was being a bit vauge. Backtrack 5 is a linux based operating system that you can boot on most computers from a USB stick. It has most of the popular hacker tools pre-installed and allows you to skip the tedious setup process of hundreds of little tools.<br /><br />You can download a copy of this OS, flash it to a USB stick and boot your computer from it. From there you can hack wifi, bluetooth, crack passwords,&nbsp; setup botnets and install rootkits. All in a handy package.<br /><br />You still need to know how to use the tools, you just don&#039;t need to install all of them. There are countless tutorials for basic hacks that use backtrack as their environment. It is very nice to follow a tutorial and know that the same command will work the same way on your system.
