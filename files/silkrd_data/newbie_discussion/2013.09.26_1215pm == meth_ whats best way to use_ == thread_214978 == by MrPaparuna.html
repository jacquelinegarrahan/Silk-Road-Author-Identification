				If your looking to smoke meth, youll need a meth bowl, or bulb. Or you can make your own from a light bulb. Best bet if your going to choose smoking as your ROA, is to spend the 10-20 bucks on a legit meth bowl. There are some for sale on SR.<br /><br />Snorting is a very common ROA, and my personal choice. Ingestion with capsules, or simply weighing out and swallowing a shard as is, will work just as well. In fact it will be more time efficient as far as how long until it takes effect. <br /><br />Then theres of coarse always IV. I know nothing about this ROA. Now keep in mind, that IVing and smoking meth are two totally different highs you get, as opposed to ingestion or snorting. I have never personally smoked or banged (IV) meth, so i cant explain how, but all the people i speak to that do smoke or inject it make it very clear that those two ROA&#039;s create an entirely different animal than snorting or ingesting will. <br /><br />Its important to have self control and will power when beginning to use meth, along with knowing moderation and responsibility. If you do not posses these traits, then meth is NOT the drug for you. There is a must read thread some where in the drug safety section about safe meth usage. I forget what the title is exactly, but its something along the lines of &#039;must read if you do meth/ice&#039; or please read if you plan to do meth, safe meth dosage&#039; or something along those lines there. Best of luck to you, and god speed. No pun intended LOL.

				I love to smoke it but be sure not to smoke too much at one time because the vapor will temporarily burn your lungs if the vapor gets too hot. Thats not the drug itself, just hot vapor. I smoke some to start off then snort a little afterwards, although the drip tastes pretty bad.

				I&#039;ve been doing Meth on and off for 20 years dude.&nbsp; Let me tell you something, the best method of all is to smoke it in a test tube.<br /><br />Get a super small test tube online and all you do is use a propane torch to heat up the side of the tube right around the bottom while blowing air into it and it will make a small hole.<br /><br />The last one I dropped and broke, the one I currently have I&#039;ve been using for about a year or so.&nbsp; To clean it you simply heat it with the torch to burn off any residue.&nbsp; The tube I have is 75mm long and 10mm wide.&nbsp; It works perfectly.<br /><br />Never EVER smoke SR meth off of aluminum foil.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s so pure it reacts with the foil and produces a taste so awful you will throw up.&nbsp; The meth will react with the aluminum and you&#039;ll be smoking HCL gas, which is fucked up.<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />

				I snorted for years way back in the day before people smoked but when i started smoking I enjoyed it more. Plus my nose was so fucked up when I took break I had to use nasal spray. When I first started smoking my nose hurt so bad for a couple weeks while the insides were healing.<br /><br />Smoking and snorting start out as different highs but you end up in the same place. Even though i prefer smoking i always thought you went through your stash faster, especially if you overheat your pip and you oil fizzes and burns.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never injected and don&#039;t think i will. it is a different lifestyle that i am not into
