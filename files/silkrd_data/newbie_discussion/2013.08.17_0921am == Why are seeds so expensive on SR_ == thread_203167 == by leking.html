				Ive noticed that cannabis seeds are pretty expensive on SR. Actually even more expensive than of the big Dutch companies like Nirvana, Royal Seeds, etc.<br /><br />How come?

				most things on SR are more expensive than the average market price, all of the drugs on here are double that of the normal cost however you pay for anonymity and security which you wouldnt get when buying things normally.

				I wouldn&#039;t agree with everything being more expensive.<br />I don&#039;t know about other drugs, but weed on SR is a loooot cheaper than where I&#039;m located. Not even considering that the quality here is also better.<br /><br />

				Not really sure about seeds, but presumably there are alot of overheads when operating on SR... <br /><br />Actual running of the business and then the cost of turning BTC into $$$. <br /><br />Not sure how they do it, but if Breaking Bad is anything to go by, it will cost something.<br /><br />Is there much competition in the seed market on SR?<br /><br />For example, MDMA seems to be cheaper than street rates as there are many vendors competing with each-other....<br /><br />

This seems like an ideal product for Mail Forwarding as it&#039;s very low profile and apart from the product itself buyers are paying for shipping time and the highest possibility of actually receiving the package to begin with. With a successful delivery to a Mail Forwarder the risk itself would be virtually eliminated and the shipping time would be significantly decreased in comparison with ordering from the source(s). :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not really sure about seeds, but presumably there are alot of overheads when operating on SR...<br /><br />Actual running of the business and then the cost of turning BTC into $$$. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Once again entirely true for any product which is illegal, but seeds can be bought in the open from the Netherlands and this is unlikely to change any time soon. I&#039;ve been under the impression there&#039;s no point in selling seeds here on Silk Road as the Vendors have priced it too close to the original price but if this is not the case this changes things.&nbsp; :P<br />----------<br />The problem for me as a Vendor if I were to start doing this is I have no knowledge of seeds whatsoever basically. While I could start researching the subject I have fairly limited time as I have an insane amount of Active Projects going and I&#039;m pretty sure it would be better spent focusing on getting better at Mail Forwarding itself than figuring out what seeds are the best and/or most popular. I will create a separate thread regarding the rules if I vendor for to pay someone BTC for providing a service ( in this case, me paying someone BTC for researching what seeds are the best and/or most popular and presenting me with a list - which I would have no problem if it were to be public here in the forums). Unless someone knows if there&#039;s a link to a list with recommendations already? :)

				I guess im just a snob and been blessed with cheap drug prices. When i visit the UK im shocked at the street prices of some things same in france, spain and netherlands. I happen to be used to paying £7g on MDMA and £2 on speed and weed.&nbsp; I sell MDMA wholesale at 10 and 15-20per gram. When i first came online i expected this price, even at festivals in europe M is sold at 30 and weed/speed £10. <br /><br />Seeds you can buy so easily from shops and you dont need to be a pro on selecting them either they normally have a nice description and a chart with strength,yeild,thc etc...

				Interesting to also get vendors&#039; opinions on this :)<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty much a newbie to growing, but it&#039;s very easy to find out the most popular strains.<br />Just check out the most popular strain lists on these shops (they&#039;re pretty much the biggest)<br />(CLEARNET)<br />http://www.nirvanashop.com/en/<br />http://www.royalqueenseeds.com/<br />https://www.cannabis-seeds-bank.co.uk/<br /><br />Usually growers kill the male weed plants, but once you let them mate with the females, you get hundreds of seeds per plant.<br />The mentioned shops try to find the very best strains and genetics, but honestly as a homegrower, I&#039;d be fine just using &quot;average&quot; seeds. Especially when Im new and have a high chance of fucking up. <br /><br />If I could get 30 seeds for €20 (the stores charge around €20-30 for 10 seeds), I wouldn&#039;t even have a problem planting in nearby forrests and fields. And then just coming back after a few months to see if they&#039;re still there :D<br /><br />As was also mentioned, seeds are very easy to ship in stealth. I can share some ideas via PM, if one of the vendors is interested.<br /><br />

				Yea wildlife loves weed too, but these plants do also grow naturally in the wild. So animals may eat some leaves, but not everything.<br /><br />Far more dangerous to weed are actually other humans, who will steal or kill the plant. <br /><br />Anyways, plenty of people do it. It&#039;s one of the &quot;techniques&quot; in guerilla growing weed. Sort of &quot;plant it &amp; forget it&quot;...<br /><br />I definitely wanna try it next spring, but with the going seed prices, that&#039;s gonna be an expensive experiment.

				Guerilla grows are the best bet. With the right planning and set up can get an amazing yield. Try spending a week hiking around an area, if there are farmers or walkers try and take spots that avoid them as much as you can. Dig a good irrigation system and clear a nice spot out. I like spending a few months out there with the plants, lets you get some nice head space..
