				Hello all. <br /><br />I have a couple of questions to ask to all my fellow SR members. They might be stupid questions (so don&#039;t let my name embody me, har har) but I figured I&#039;d ask since I&#039;m still confused on the whole buying from SR.<br /><br />First, when sending an email to someone I might be buying from, should I send them an email/message in or from PGP? (I&#039;m guessing I phrased that right)<br />Next, when purchasing an item, and if I&#039;m only going to be buying here and there, do I and should I use my home address? It worries me that the po po, customs, CIA or whatever will come surging through my door and that absolutely PETRIFIES ME! <br /><br />Thanks for answering and helping me and I look forward from hearing from you guys!<br /><br />Smart A

				You should definitely always use PGP to encrypt your address. Use your home unless there&#039;s a reason to suspect that they&#039;re watching it. But odds are, you&#039;ll be fine especially if you&#039;re dabbling. <br /><br />I don&#039;t encrypt messages and vendors usually don&#039;t ask you to unless it contains sensitive info. Be sure to read the vendor page!

				Alrighty! Thanks for the info Tela!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Now it&#039;s time to get some bitcoins and start my adventure on SR!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />One more question: where can I learn more about PGP? It&#039;s a very confusing thing and I just started with all of this (I&#039;m a major newbie if it doesn&#039;t show already&nbsp; :-[ ).

				You should definitely use your real name and address for plausibility deniability. Anyone can send anything in the mail. If they notice you sending to an abandoned house or P.O., they will raise suspicion.

				So I just did my first order and I think I did the PGP stuff wrong.&nbsp; I encrypted my address but used my public key as the target instead of the vendor I used.&nbsp; I corrected it and sent it to his inbox, should everything be ok?

				Yea use your real address, anything sensitive like address, name definitely use PGP.&nbsp; For trivial stuff like messages through SR you don&#039;t really need it but its good practice.&nbsp; So you did use the vendor&#039;s public key right?&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case then you&#039;re good, if you used your own public key then he/she wouldn&#039;t be able to read it.
