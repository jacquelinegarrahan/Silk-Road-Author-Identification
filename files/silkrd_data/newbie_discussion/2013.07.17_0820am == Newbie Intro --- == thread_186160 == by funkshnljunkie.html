				Hi all.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just want to introduce myself.&nbsp; I like to consider myself a “functional junkie” because ever since the early 2000’s, I’ve been enjoying the comfortable “body buzz” of poppy pod tea – once, sometimes twice a day.&nbsp; Certainly to help this old body get out of bed in the mornings (55yo, 6’8”, 250lbs – read excess stress), but sometimes after work also in order to “wind down” appropriately (like I am now ;o).&nbsp; I say functional junkie only because I know I’m hooked by how the dry periods kill me!&nbsp; And, boy are pods getting expensive.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I can buy them legally online.&nbsp; Used to find them in local flower shops and Hobby Lobby’s everywhere, but times is changin’. <br /><br />Back in November, I had to go to the emergency room for the first time in my life.&nbsp; Terrible “indigestion”, stomach pain, and sharp pain in the upper back between the shoulder blades.&nbsp; They didn’t waste any time pumping me full of morphine.&nbsp; When that didn’t help, they pumped in something much stronger that I didn’t catch the name of.&nbsp; Needless to say, THAT worked and was very ‘comfortable’ after that.&nbsp; Long story short, was diagnosed with gallstones, and because I didn’t have any insurance, have been ‘milking’ this pain since then.&nbsp; Chasing doctors from Texas to Louisiana, and now to Arkansas.&nbsp; Fortunately I’m a vet, so I now finally have a surgery date next month to have this bad boy removed at the VA hospital.<br />&nbsp;<br />I guess my love for opiates has reached a point that I was searching for something stronger than the tea, yet not keep me chasing doctors.&nbsp; Especially knowing that the pain will soon be gone :o(<br /><br />Well, about 3 weeks ago I stumbled on onion, then SR, then the whole world opened up to me!&nbsp; Wowza!&nbsp; I have been doing much reading of late as I prepare to gather my BC’s and make my first purchase.&nbsp; Not sure if I want to go for a stamp for starters, or stick to pharmaceuticals.&nbsp; I will say that I have a wife and a dog.&nbsp; I’m 25 years into a career working for a branch of the DOT, so I must always be very careful and vigilant for obvious reasons.&nbsp; I don’t want to smoke any weed (although I love it), because it stays in my system so long (can’t wait to retire and smoke one hell-of-a HUGE celebratory hooter), but I am comfortable doing any form of opiates.<br /><br />OK, I’m rambling here, but I’d like to hear from anybody with experience that wouldn’t mind giving me some pointers.&nbsp; I am aware that to FE is frowned upon (though most vendors require first-timers to do so).&nbsp; I would really like some advice on simple ways to acquire BC.&nbsp; I’m trying to set up an account now with MtGox, but they want so much info.&nbsp; Are there less intrusive – and safe - ways to buy BC?<br /><br />Also, what are these “wallets”, and encryption codes (public and private), and..... Well, you see I am a total NEWB.<br /><br />Thanks for your time and I really look forward to reading your replies.<br /><br />Functnljunkie<br />

				try localbitcoins.com&nbsp; by far the easiest way to get them quick and anonymously.<br /><br />wallets are the place you keep your bitcoins in. you can download it for free (http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) or just use the online wallet you get with the localbitcoins account you create.<br /><br />the keys are propably PGP keys. there are a lot of guides here on the forum. don&#039;t get scared by all the people saying how difficult it is, that&#039;s not true. its super easy. just get yourself gpg4usb (gpg4usb.cpunk.de )and play around for a few minutes and you&#039;ll see what i mean.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to SR, I hope you find the Road as awesome an entity as I do! You can get enormous amounts of info hanging out on the forum, and I strongly suggest you do before making a purchase (it sounds like that&#039;s what you&#039;re doing already, just saying it anyway :). <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know much about poppy pods and their ability to create dependence and raise tolerance, but please be careful moving on to hard opiates, not just because of the inherent dangers of use, but the excruciating withdrawals which comes with regular exposure, and sudden cessation. You&#039;re older than me and no doubt smarter, so I apologise if that sounded like I was talking down to you.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you want more info on how to get btc tell us what country you&#039;re from, I&#039;m guessing the States, somebody from you&#039;re area will hopefully help. Wallets are places for online storage. Google &quot;Blockchain wallet&quot; and read some of their tutorials. PGP is a means of encrypting messages so only you and the intended recipient can read them. There are a number of tutorials for that in the forums. Do a forum search for &quot;Pine PGP club&quot;. Pine is a senior forum member with an incredible wealth of knowledge, and is also just a very nice person.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck, all the best, sucks you can&#039;t enjoy that spliff now! :), but yeah, read read read, AB.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Duly (sp) noted.&nbsp; And thanks for the quick replies.&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;ve already downloaded and installed gpg4win.&nbsp; Holy cow that looks cumbersome.&nbsp; Is encryption really necessary for a low volume guy like myself.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like I&#039;m trying to run from the law, incite violence, or otherwise explore fringe groups.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m looking into the BC thing you mentioned.&nbsp; And yes, I plan to ease into the harder substances.&nbsp; I certainly have developed a tolerance for opiates so I should be able to handle the effects - and manage it&#039;s intensity (or lack thereof).<br /><br />Thanks again and keep &#039;em coming.&nbsp; Conversely, I&#039;ll update this thread as I learn more.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;:) Cumbersome is a good word to describe pgp (or gpg4win) when starting out. It becomes a smoother process with practice. Most vendors, maybe all, don&#039;t require you use pgp, it&#039;s there to use if you want. I&#039;d recommend using it. You state you&#039;re not on the run from the law, pgp will help keep it that way! It&#039;s up to you, from experience lots of people use pgp, but the majority don&#039;t.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Lots of info to get your head around, I know. Please, keep us updated with your ventures on SR, bye, AB.
