				I use MTgox for getting bitcoins and the price of these seem to be rising exponentially (about $47 each) while the prices of each SR object is still the same? Is there anyone else who notices this or is there a cheaper/better place to buy bitcoins? Please help

				Anyone offering Btc cheaper than Mt Gox may be a scammer. If they offer significantly cheaper, they are almost certain to be scammers. Mt Gox is one place you can go to know the current trading price of Btc. Blockchain.info has nice charts including BTC dollar value here:<br />https://blockchain.info/charts/market-price?timespan=60days&amp;showDataPoints=false&amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;show_header=true&amp;scale=0&amp;address=<br />Blockchain may get their numbers from Mt Gox, I don&#039;t remember. Rumor has it, Mt Gox provides your personal information to any government that wants to know. Some people prefer to get btc more anonymously and searching the forum will find discussions about that. <br /><br />The market price of bitcoins has been rising fast on average recently. They can crash fast also, so if you get some you want to spend them before they lose value unless you want to hold on to them as an investment (risky, but great recently).&nbsp; Most products sold on SR have their price linked to USdollar values and so as BTC go up, it takes fewer btc to buy an item.<br /><br />Since btc have been going up, many people want them and that makes them go up faster. That can change suddenly at any time. Fun ride on the way up tho :-)

				Couple more tips:<br /><br />If searching in the forum, go up to the top level &quot;Silk Road forums&quot; or you are only searching in the sub-forum you are in. (they should fix that default setting)<br /><br />If you see all prices in SR as btc (another default i&#039;m not fond of) and want them to show up as USDollars instead,<br />go to you SR account &gt; settings&nbsp; and click the box that changes it and&nbsp; then &quot;update settings&quot;

				No, the SR prices in btc are not the same, many have dropped their btc price in tow with the higher cost for btc in usd. just look around on the Road, true some Vendors have higher btc rates, but most if not all have lowered their rates. ;)

				Vendors have a choice of linking prices to Btc or USDollars. Most all choose to link their prices to the USD value as that currency is much more stable.

				It passes a few wallets on it&#039;s way to SR, so I&#039;m not very worried.<br /><br />Plus I&#039;m not big enough to make anything care so much they&#039;d trace funds.
