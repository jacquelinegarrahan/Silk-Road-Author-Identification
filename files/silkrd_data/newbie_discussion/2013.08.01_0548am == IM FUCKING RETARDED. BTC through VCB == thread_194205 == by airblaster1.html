				so i had been trying to buy btc this week and localbitcoins wasnt working out for me, and alot of other sites have a waiting period until i get my coin, i needed it now, so i went with a sketchier method of buying a moneypack, i bought one and it was for $1000, i did my research and found a trustworthy vendor who charged me a 12% fee, i was about $200 short on what i wanted to buy, so i bought another MP, that vendor was out of coin for the week, and im rushing things to get orders sent out in time for next week, i look through a few vendors and nobody is making transactions with MP, maybe a few, anyway i rush into this purchase, going through vice city bank, i figure its only 200$ so im not worried, well this sketchy little bitch gets my MP# and the next day cancels my order then i check my balance and its gone, i message him politely, asking whats up, he reads my PM but doesnt message me back, so i send him another one asking him to respond, he reads that too, well now im pissed, not about the money, more about that this is SR, alot of the vendors on SR seem to be pretty nice guys, and buisiness goes well for us, but then we have sketchy little bitches, that steal our drug money, im glad it was a small amount, and i learned a lesson from what happens when you dont research vendors, i read a forum the next day about vicecitybank about how hes shady and has ripped people off before, and how people cant believe hes still a vendor here on SR, anyway that wont be happening to me again.

				This VCB prick is too busy chocking on cock to respond. He&#039;s a scumbag and got me for $600. Since blockchain/bitinstant doesn&#039;t work anymore, for me anyway, I use localbitcoins. There&#039;s some vendors on there that are really quick too. The only SR BTC vendor I&#039;ll use now if I absolutely have to for whatever reason is Collapses . He&#039;s a great BTC vendor and a straight shooter, he helped me with a mistake that I made on my end on a BTC transaction . That helped me out hugely and he was in no way obligated to help me, he just did it cause he&#039;s a good dude.

				If you still have the original money pak and receipt you can call Greendot and tell them you didn&#039;t giv the number to anyone but you&#039;ve been unable to use it. You have to talk to a supervisor and fax them the (gotfreefax.com) proof of purchase. I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;ll be giving my money back (sounds like its a one time thing if they do) or not but I&#039;ll update this either way.
