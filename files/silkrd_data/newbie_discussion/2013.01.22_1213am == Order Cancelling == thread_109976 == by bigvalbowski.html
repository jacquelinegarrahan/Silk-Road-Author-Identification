				can you cancel your order exactly 4 days after it was placed, or on the 4th day?<br /><br />for example, if i placed an order monday at 8 pm do i have to wait 4 days later at 8 pm? or once it hits the 4th day is it eligible to be cancelled?<br /><br />thanks and sorry if this doesnt make any sense

				Sorry I&#039;m also a new one on the road so I can&#039;t really answer your question. But I suppose the best would be to write a message to the seller and clear tings out.<br />If the packet is already shipped-out I guess you will get what you ordered, otherwise if it&#039;s a legit vendor it should be possible to cancel the deal.<br /><br />-Peace over-

				A buyer can only cancel their order if it goes beyond the 4 day dispatch threshold. I&#039;m sure if you ask the vendor nicely they will cancel your order for you.<br /><br />Dank

I assume if you cancel one of those, you&#039;ll get less bitcoins back if the value has risen, so you won&#039;t be any better off. :(

				I&#039;m happy I could help at some point. :)<br />One thing I learned being a member at other &quot;bud over mail&quot; services was, that most of the vendors have their special days for packaging and sending, because they don&#039;t want to have you gear stuck in a Post office over the weekend.<br />Something more I could say is that it is never wrong to enter the vendors name into the search function here and find out what other users say about him.
