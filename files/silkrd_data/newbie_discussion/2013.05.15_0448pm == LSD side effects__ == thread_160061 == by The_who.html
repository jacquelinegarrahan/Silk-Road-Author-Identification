				Hey Guys,<br />A bud of mine and I have taken L a few times. After each trip, my bud complained that his entire left side of his body constantly tingled. The tingle continued after for a few days after each hit (low doses) and then subsided. <br />After our last trip, the tingling feeling (similar to pins n needles) did not subside. It has now become a permanent feeling on the entire left hand side of his body.<br />He has had various CT scans and even an MRI which did not find anything wrong with him. This was more than 6 months ago<br />The tingling is not painful but very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Is it possible that the LSD could have triggered this tingling feeling??<br />Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advise? <br />We trip on low doses and our trips are only on special occasions.<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts??

				hmm weird. I doubt lsd would of caused this. I would be more curious about the lsd he had. I would test it to see if it was real LSD or an NBOME or something. Even still i doubt it.

				Sorry to hear about your friend. I&#039;m no doctor but have done LSD quite a few times over many years and have done quite a bit of research into psychedelic culture. To the best of my knowledge, there is no mention in any literature (and it was a very studied drug) of the symptom you describe being associated with LSD. Nothing I have ever read in trips reports/Erowid/anecdotaly either.<br /><br />Are you quite sure it was true LSD? (Don&#039;t mean to sound patronising BTW!)<br /><br />Beyond the possibility of a different substance, it could be an underlying issue that the sensitivity induced by LSD brought to your friend&#039;s attention and he is now sensitive to it.<br /><br />Pretty sure it&#039;s not the acid. There have been a lot of tabs down a lot of throats since Albert&#039;s bike ride and it has never been reported.<br /><br />Hope your friend and the medics can get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />Take care.

				It seems like you&#039;ve already seen some doctors about this, have you told them this happened after taking lsd?<br /><br />Also, are you sure it was lsd and not nbome or dox or some other RC?<br /><br />How much did your friend take? ug? estimate? <br /><br />Anything over 1000ug gets you into pretty high dose territory and depending on a persons weight can make for an extremely strong trip.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Acid itself wouldn&#039;t have caused the cronic tinglyness but during your trip your friend could have gotten a bt dehydrated a bit which can cause some negative long term effects, nothing that long term.<br /><br />Anytime you take anything not matter how fucked up you get, you may not want to but make sure you stay cool and hydrated.

				i took 3 drops christ L 2 days ago and i still have this pain in my arms and legs which i never encountered like that. It feels like it is pain in my veins. Also i had a rather strong headache at the end of the trip and the next day. I actually hope the headache came from laughing and overusing my brainpowers to much. Im really curious if anybody else had these problems as well?<br /><br />Regards

				Maybe he has a hypersensitivity to drugs in general. I know since I&#039;ve gotten older, drugs (even allergy pills) have had more side effects than in my younger years. With me it seems to come in phases, a couple months even an aspirin will throw me for a loop. I also experienced the tingling on one side of my body after about 2 years of moderate drug use. (daily weed and cigarette smoking, other drugs every couple days: amphetamine, meth-amphetamine, lsd, mdma, DMT, Ketamine, shrooms, alcohol)<br /><br />After I quit, there was about 6 months where one side of my body just felt different than the other. I went to neurologists, had some tests done and everything was ok. But I still felt funny, sometimes tingley, sometimes just off. I also started yoga maybe 3 months before I quit the hard drugs, and continued with that for about a year after. <br /><br />Years later and I still feel a little, um, unbalanced? But its barely noticeable now. Never pins and needles. I&#039;d be happy to compare experiences if you have any other questions. I just let it go after a couple months, I think doctors thought I was a hypochondriac. <br /><br />The things that made me feel better were drinking plenty of water, getting lots of exercise, and eating healthy. Also I didn&#039;t know much about nutrition at the time so I made all my food from scratch. For some reason or another I just never added salt to anything. That was a problem, and caused some mental fogginess. Eventually I figured that one out thanks to a friend of mine.

				b0m, thanks for your post.<br /><br />I also ordered from JesusofRave some ToC liquid LSD, but I haven&#039;t tried it yet. I will try first with one drop to gauge it effects. It would be a bummer if it produces these nasty side effects... I will post once I&#039;ve tried it, but I will start with a small dose.
