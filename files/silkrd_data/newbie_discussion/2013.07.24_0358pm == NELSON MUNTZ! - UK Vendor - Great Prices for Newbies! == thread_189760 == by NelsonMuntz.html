				one of the best ways to get a good reputation fast would be to sample out your products and or assure that you are selling a quality product.

				Have a bump.<br /><br />Recently received from these guys. Superb delivery and packaging-Worth looking into.<br /><br />(Can&#039;t comment on quality...yet). <br /><br />Vending for 15 days with 150 transactions says something I reckon.

				I am new to the forum side of SR so please correct me if I am in the entirely wrong part to give this review and I will happily copy to somewhere more suitable. <br /><br />STEALTH; The free sample of LSD arrived in good time, in what tows the line between ingenious and comical packaging. It is in the packaging that my only complaint lies, THE STEALTH WAS TOO GOOD! I was unable to work out what had been lased with LSD and it was only until I called my friend who had made an order for 5 tabs I discovered the LSD sneakily hidden. <br /><br />COMMUNICATION; Swift and good humored. There is also something to be said for Nelson not chasing me up for a review despite the order being placed over a week a go. Which is thoroughly appreciated.&nbsp; <br /><br />EFFECTS; Only dosing with one tab at a small gathering of mates with a for mentioned friend, we all dropped Nelsons LSD. Come up time varied between 30 minutes and an hour depending on the person. Visual effect where underwhelming however the body high was euphoric, and up there with any MDMA I have taken. With that said many of my friends on the same tabs experienced far more profound visuals than I achieved, but that is the nature of the drug. All who had taken the LSD where sure it was the real deal and gave us as a group of friends one of the funniest nights of tripping we have had. <br /><br />CONCLUSION; Nelson is to all intense and purposes the perfect vendor, swift communication and quality product. The idea behind the the packaging is excellent and unlike anything I have seen on the road. However it does need to some fine tuning, but as a new vendor that is to be expected.<br />&nbsp;<br />A funny anecdote to finish on, I was in a bathroom at a party on Monday night when I found the small package the MDMA and LSD is sent in, for everyone who has seen this, there is unlikely anything like it to be seen at a party. When I had finished and re-opened the door there was a bopping head asking if I had seen his Mandy I of course I burst out laughing and pointed it out. We continued to have a conversation about Nelson and SR. What are the chances?<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the free sample I have already placed subsequent orders. Cheers! x
