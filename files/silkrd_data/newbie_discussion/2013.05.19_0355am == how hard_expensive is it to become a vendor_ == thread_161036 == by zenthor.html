				I&#039;m mostly just curious because i didn&#039;t see anything under the vendors wiki page. I&#039;m putting some thought into it doing it in the future (maybe 6 months to a year from now) maybe small amounts of shrooms and high quality mj. How much does the SR charge for a vendor account and how much is the bond? would it be worth the hassle if i&#039;m only looking to move less than 1k of product a month? i&#039;m just thinking that it would probably be a bit more secure than selling face to face... also i don&#039;t have many friends who are into shrooms and everyone has weed around here.

				$500 for the account which you get back when you meet the requirements of the bond. I can only speak from my experience but I put a couple K in before I sold anything (computers/security, postage, accurate scales, packaging room set up (must be 100% clean process), MBB &amp; food grade packaging , impulse sealers, gloves, inner materials for stealth, labels, and some misc stuff). Do it right to keep yourself and your buyers safe.

				while i personally love spreading the psychadellic experience and making a bit of money for my troubles now that i think about it some more it may be a bit too much work, I dont want to make a mistake and put a customer or myself at risk, or do this sort of thing full time. Thanks for the response though!

				No problem Z. I&#039;m not trying to discourage you at all but just want you to be prepared and safe. I spent 6 months just researching everything I could before I jumped in and I&#039;m still trying to improve all the time. It&#039;s too serious a game to screw up.
