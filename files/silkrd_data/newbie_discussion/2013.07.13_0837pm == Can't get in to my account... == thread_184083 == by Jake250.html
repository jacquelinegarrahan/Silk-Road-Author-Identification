				Title: <strong>Can't get in to my account...</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>Jake250</strong> on <strong>July 13, 2013, 08:37 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				I only just started ordering through SR and have made 4 orders within 3 days, two orders i recall seeing a few hours ago were &#039;in transit&#039;, i had about 0.09 bitcoins in my SR wallet, now i can&#039;t get in to my account. So i have made a new account wondering whether to contact SR Support through it regarding my previous account or what?<br />I cant fucking stand these cowardly hackers, i understand on my part i may not have take the best precautions but these wannabe-hackers just go after the poor because they are too cowardly to attack the rich. Fucking bastards.<br />Appreciate any help.<br />Thanks.

				The site is down for maintenance at the moment but when it comes back up, you&#039;ll need to create a new account, send a message to SR Support from that new account, and provide information about your most recent bitcoin deposit in order to prove the account in question belongs to you.&nbsp; Then they should be able to help you reset the password and get back in.

				Hi Cirrus,<br />Thank for the reply, so when you say i need to make a new account? does maintenance of SR shut down all accounts or something? As i couldn&#039;t get in to my account yet i manged to create a new one with no hassle, which is why i&#039;m assuming i&#039;ve been hacked...<br />Thanks.

				It just says &#039;Login failed, please try again&#039; after loading for about 20seconds.<br />My passwords for both accounts are definitely correct. Guess i&#039;ve definitely been hacked then.<br />Do you know of a SR Support address i can use through tor mail?<br />Thanks.

				Thanks for the help. I have done this and requested contact via my tormail as every new account i open i can&#039;t get back in too after logging out.<br />I am concerned as when i started transactions a few days ago i asked a very &#039;newbie&#039; question of how to get bitcoins in to my account as i was trying to &#039;withdraw&#039; them in there and completely missed the &#039;deposit&#039; option.&nbsp; So i must seem like a right idiot contacting them twice withing 4 days.
