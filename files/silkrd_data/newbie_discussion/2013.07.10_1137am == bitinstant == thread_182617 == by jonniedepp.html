				Anyone use it lately? Deposited money at a cash location yesterday, still pending.. Called and talked to zipzap, they said it&#039;s on bitinstants end and that they haven&#039;t processed it yet.. This is my first time using bitinstant and my first time buying btc and it&#039;s not instant at all, anyone with similar experience? I don&#039;t want to wait 3 days.

				Shit, I&#039;d be happy if&nbsp; bitinstant worked at all for me. I used to use it all the time, thru my blockchain account. Now, it doesn&#039;t work at all, thru blockchain or straight thru bitinstant . <br />Anyway, when it was working, I had the same problem your having once or twice . I emailed support at both zip zap and bitinbstant and both times they were able to fix me right up.<br />Good luck!!

				Weird. I used BitInstant on Sunday night and it hit my BlockChain wallet in less than an hour. I know a lot of people talk bad about it but I had a great experience with it. As soon as the cashier processed my order I got email confirmations from BitInstant &amp; ZipZap, then like I said forty five minute tops to my wallet. Hope things turn out alright for you bro, keep that receipt with the processing # is all I got to tell you.

				So let&#039;s talk alternatives then.<br /><br />Coinbase is reasonably secure and reliable from what I can tell and the fees are very low (1% transaction fee is it) but it took a whole week for my 7 BTC to arrive and the value changed a lot by then (would have lost 200 dollars if I cashed out at the nadir). If you&#039;re good at predicting the market or don&#039;t mind sitting on coins, I&#039;d say Coinbase is pretty alright for USA users. Dunno if they do other currencies.

After I set up my account with BitInstant I had to provide a picture ID which raised my total Daily Cash Limit to like $10,000. But they still only allow $500 transfers at a time, so anymore than that I have to make multiple transfers. Did you by chance give them your ID too? That might be the hold up, in case you didn&#039;t. Just a guess. My second guess would be it&#039;s based on where you&#039;re located but that doesn&#039;t make any sense.<br /><br />@ 88fxstc <br /><br />Like Jonnie said, I had to set up the transaction on BitInstant first and I just put my BlockChain wallet as the receiving address. Sort of reverse of what you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />It went smooth from there, I just hope it goes that way every time. From all the horror stories I hear about it makes me feel like I got lucky one time. Must say a prayer to the BTC Gods, that they may have mercy on my transfers and never forsake me.<br /><br />&quot;Time is money.&quot; - BitInstant slogan<br /><br />&quot;BitInstant Dealing with Increased Traffic and Transaction Delays&quot; - Title of Last BitInstant blog (dated back in April)&nbsp; ???

				I definitely feel that Bitinstant support blows, but I haven&#039;t had any problems using them.&nbsp; It was screwed up for a week or so (about a month ago), but no problems since.&nbsp; I just did a cash deposit yesterday and had my coins within an hour.

				Used it for the first time Monday and had coins in wallet in less than an hour.&nbsp; From some stuff I&#039;ve read on the reddit SR forum, their issues may vary from state to state.&nbsp; I&#039;m in AZ and couldn&#039;t be happier about my first bitinstant experience.&nbsp; Way easier, cheaper and faster than a bank wire.&nbsp; That being said, a lot of people seem to be having issues with it recently.

				I used Bitinstant successfully yesterday, Tuesday. I used the cash deposit/moneygram option, sending it directly to a bitcoin wallet address. I had no problem.<br /><br />At first, I could not seem to get logged-in on a computer using Windows XP. Later I tried it with a newer computer running Windows 7, then connected right away using the TOR browser.<br /><br />The money was in my wallet within an hour.<br /><br />JeanRob

				Bitinstant hasn&#039;t let me try a transaction for the last day and half. Really frustrating. I have so many ways to pay, including credit card, cash, debit card, bank account, paypal balance, but it seems like I can&#039;t get bitcoins unless I&#039;m willing to wait a week.
