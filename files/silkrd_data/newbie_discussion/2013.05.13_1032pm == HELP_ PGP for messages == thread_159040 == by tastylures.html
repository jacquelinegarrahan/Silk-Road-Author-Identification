				New to the PGP thing. Used GPGTools to create my keys. Now I&#039;m not exactly sure how to go about using them.<br />A couple questions:<br />-Should I encrypt messages to vendors on SR if they are just about product inquiry/special orders?<br />-How do I encrypt something appropriately? (How do I initiate the encryption, where do I put their/my public key)<br /><br />I guess just a general quick shakedown on how to encrypt a short textual message, and how to put that in a message to vendor or in an email (I&#039;d assume email would just upload the file as an attachement?)<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Just wanting to keep security up and not be one of those ignorant folks.<br /><br />-tastylures

				I&#039;m certainly no expert on PGP, but the program I use is GPG4USB.&nbsp; I like it because you can run it on Linux or Windows off of a USB drive, so you can always have it with you. It&#039;s easy to create your own keys and to import keys so that you can encrypt messages for specific people/vendors, etc.&nbsp; Give ita shot and see if that doesn&#039;t work for you. A really easy and intuitive program to use.

				I use a mac :(<br />Also, I was able to create keys and import them all just fine.<br />I&#039;m just not certain exactly how I encrypt a message using a key now that I have one and can (obviously) get the other person&#039;s public key.<br />How do I make an encrypted message?<br />Anyone willing to help me through some messaging or emailing?<br />Thanks!

				Read the Newbie PGP Club thread above. Its full of instructions and people who will practice sending messages. Handy way to then pad your post count without spamming.

				The PGP club post has a lot of good info.<br /><br />As for your question on what you should or shouldn&#039;t encrypt, personally I encrypt &amp; sign all messages that aren&#039;t simple small talk/simple questions that don&#039;t involve product specifically, otherwise I sign it. You can never be too careful. Signing at the minimum validates that you are who you say you are, and that you have attested that the message sent came from you. When you use the recipients public key in addition, it also acts as a validation that the message you intended to send, is also intended for the destination person. <br /><br />Encryption should be done using the recipients public key - this is the reason that they give their public keys out. Doing so means that they are the only person that can decrypt the message (other than you, since you also use your key, though you can also choose to not allow this.), as they are the only one that has their own private key and passphrase that enables the usage of that key.<br /><br />As for how to do all of this, the instructions and videos for all operating systems are very well written in the PGP Club thread :)

				Another question: say you encrypt your message to a vendor using his public key, how is he supposed to reply an encrypted message to you? There doesn&#039;t seem to be a &#039;profile page&#039; or something for buyers where you can put your public key on. So the only way is to add your public key to the first message you send to someone?

				Where&#039;s a good place to post my public key?<br /><br />Also, StExo, when I put your message into a file and tried to decrypt it, an error was shown saying &quot;no private key&quot; although I shouldn&#039;t need one since I added your public key.

				You can post your public key here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg824#msg824<br /><br />The reason you couldn&#039;t decrypt the message you encrypted for StExo is because you encrypted it using his public key....so you&#039;d need his private key to decrypt it. ;)
