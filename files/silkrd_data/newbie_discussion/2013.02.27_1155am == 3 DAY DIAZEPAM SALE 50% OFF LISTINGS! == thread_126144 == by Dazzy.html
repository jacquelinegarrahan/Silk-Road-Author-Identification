				I also like xanax, but I dont have that for sale unfortunately!&nbsp; I am putting this sale on for people who like valium and have tried mine before, and want to take advantage of a couple of days of very cheap prices!&nbsp; Thanks for the input though buddy, but it isnt really related here!!&nbsp; But at these prices, valium is the way forward!!

				had over a hundred ordered today, get your orders in while they last, i suspect a lot may go quickly at these prices, and and as such may run out and have to reload after friday.&nbsp; After which the prices will go back up, however I am thinking of lowering my normal and constant prices anyway, but this 50% off is only till friday!<br /><br />Hope to hear from some of you!<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Dazzy

				Also, if none of you have seen it, I have access to 100mg Morphine Sulphate NHS prescription tablets, these are not on sale, and I dont officially have a listing up for them yet, but if any of you want any, let me know how many and I can create a custom listing for you!

				Said this in another thread before but Dazzy is by far the best diazapan vendor I have dealt with on silk road!<br />Quickest delivery times i&#039;ve ever experienced including next day delivery on more than one occasion.<br />Looking forward to making a purchase in the sale and also I am interested in trying some of the morphine sulphate pills if you get them in.<br />Keep up the good work!

				Hey Guys!&nbsp; <br /><br />The sale last week cleared me out!&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />But the good news is that I am keeping my prices at this level for a little while longer!&nbsp; I have also sorted out my postage options, as I realised they havent been changed in a while, which meant that postage costs were far too high, so now postage is at actual cost to myself as it used to be!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Get your orders in Guys! ;D<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Dazzy
