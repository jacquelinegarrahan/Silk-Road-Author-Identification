				So today I got the courage to ask out this girl out Ive had a crush on for awhile who&#039;s a year infront of me doing the same major I am doing. So finally I got the courage to do it stupidly enough I did it when she was with 15 of her friends, male and female so it was even more nerve wrecking then it should of been. So we get talking and her friends are asking stupid questions etc like all friends do of the girl youre hitting on. So I invited her to this event were having at our fraternity in a week and she&#039;d go and then gave her my number..stupidly enough I didnt ask her number. Im pretty sure now, that she was either pitying me or being extremely sarcastic I couldn&#039;t notice in the moment.&nbsp; :-[ She did also ask how much my car and watch etc cost making me feel like she is a gold digger which she probably is.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />So later I sit down at this lounge and her teacher comes to, shes a female, and tells me &#039;shes way out of your league, you have no chance, sorry&#039; and walks away. This was probably the weirdest/meanest thing I heard a teacher say to me. So I was kinda shocked and sad at the same moment.&nbsp; :-\ Idk why that teacher did that but now I think she might hate me. <br /><br />So obviously Im not going to get a call or a message from the girl I asked out.. thats obviously a dead horse. But when the girl leaves the classroom I see the teacher escorting her, like she is protecting her from me like im some kind of a rapist.&nbsp; :-\ <br /><br />I just dont get, Im always being pushed around by everyone. No girls seem to give a shit about me, I had a girlfriend two years ago when I just got to college, after awhile I caught her cheating on me and I gave her the world and everything she wanted. I just cant do it anymore. Every girl I try to talk to either doesnt notice me or tells me to go and f myself. Same with professors/teachers I just feel like they are hating me for no reason, Im getting top grades and Im doing a lot of charitable work with my fraternity. It just seems that even a lot of my friends are pushing me away.&nbsp; I feel like the whole world is turning and leaving me standing still.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just dont know what to do anymore. Ive been lurking around the forums for about a year and saw that people here give genuine advice and really do try and help you.&nbsp; :)

				There&#039;s a few good ways to catch a fish. You can chase them or bait them. <br /><br />You want real advice? Focus your energy on your life, your career, your brain. <br /><br />The awesome thing about being male is that physical attractiveness is one of the least important qualities women look for. There is no shortcut to being amazing to woman. <br /><br />If you are having trouble with women now, thats understandable, your in college, you don&#039;t have much to offer yet. In a few years if you could have a great job, a great skill, a great personality, women will COME TO YOU. <br /><br />Work hard on yourself. Forget about attracting women by any trick. Be the best you can be and you&#039;ll be fine. No woman is out of a successful confident man&#039;s league. No matter how beautiful she is.

				Honestly mate it sounds like you got some serious self-esteem issues. Don&#039;t worry though, most people do they just tend to hide it well! Its like a big cosmic joke. I had MAJOR problems with getting dates when I was younger but I figured it out for myself. The advice you&#039;ve already received is super great stuff and I agree 100%. <br /><br />Focus on your own self improvement. You want to have confidence and self-esteem? Well you gotta do esteemable things. Volunteer some where for even a couple hours a week and you will start to feel good about yourself in no time.&nbsp; You want to be physically attractive? Get to the gym, work out, get a haircut, make sure your clothes are clean and you don&#039;t smell. Its all super basic stuff but I&#039;m telling you if you do these things you will feel better and look better right away. <br /><br />Girls are silly creatures full of irrational responses. Don&#039;t go for the hottest girl you crush on, find one that genuinely seems interesting. You want to be interesting you gotta do something interesting. Pick a unique hobby and get good at it. Girls like guys who stand out, even if its in a niche. <br /><br />Most of all dude... you are going to be ok. This is one little setback. Forget about the awkwardness and embarrasment. So what this didn&#039;t work out. AT LEAST YOU TRIED! That takes balls man! Asking a girl out in front of her freinds takes guts dude! Yes it was foolhardy but who gives a fuck you went up to her like a boss and fucking asked her out. If she has a stick up her butt then thats on her. Sometimes you gotta slay the dragon before you get the princess. In this case the dragon you gotta slay is your own non-belief in yourself. Chin up dude, things are going to get better for sure.

				Try carrying stacks of drug money around. I haven&#039;t spit game in three years and fuck more girls than most of my friends. I&#039;m 21. I literally dont shower for up to 4 days at a time and still get it in. It&#039;s kinda disgusting even from my perspective. <br /><br />Also, heroin. Bitches love heroin. And sex on it is amazing, just dont do too much so you can blow your load.

I just see everyone with partners, all my friends and everything. I just feel lonely hahah kinda pathetic I know.&nbsp; :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I spent a couple years in the seduction community. There are tricks, techniques, lines, etc that we used to manipulate women and others to do what we wanted. Its underhanded, shitty, and I hated it. But I learned a lot.<br /><br />Focus on things that make you happy. Chasing tail can be one of them, but that shouldn&#039;t be the only thing. If that&#039;s your best skill, you&#039;re going to strike out. A lot.<br /><br />If you like rock climbing, go rock climbing, if you like music, go to concerts. Even better, when you talk about these things talk passionately. My current girlfriend always comments on how passionate I can be. Whether its for music and the concerts I love to go to or if its for her.<br /><br />Learn to be social. This is a skill that will treat you so well in life no matter what. You remember that awesome high school jock that seemed to be the most popular kid in the world? He learned early on how to talk to people. The most popular kid in my school was one of the nicest guys in the world. He would talk to anyone, remembered their names, and said hi. It may not seem like much to know people&#039;s names, but it means the world to them. Especially those that typically get ignored. I&#039;ve heard that the sweetest sound to anyone is their name.<br /><br />Know that that girl, guy, whomever you just talked to, isn&#039;t the only person in the world. Don&#039;t act needy like they are the most important thing in the world and you have to go out/talk to them. You&#039;re the prize, they need to catch you. Building on my last point, because you now know a lot of people and talk to people, that girl you want will notice and something in her mind will basically click and say &quot;hey, a lot of people like this guy. There must be something awesome about him.&quot; She&#039;ll give you the chance you need. She&#039;ll end up chasing you.<br /><br />Most importantly, is do you. Do things you want to do, for yourself. Improve yourself. Don&#039;t live to the ideals of others, don&#039;t act like the guy she says she wants. If you have an opinion on something, speak it! Don&#039;t just spinelessly back hers. She won&#039;t appreciate that.

				There&#039;s a lot of good advice above. Be helpful to people, as women who see a guy taking control and doing things for people is a &#039;provider&#039;. They deny it&nbsp; but women just want to be kept really. They want be guarded by a strong man, whether that be physically or mentally strong.

				it all sums up to:<br /><br />&quot;dont put the pussy in a pedestal&quot;<br /><br />as slang and of low-value as this sounds, it actually implies a lot. it means do not try to impress her, screw that. it&#039;s all about, as some above have pointed out, being passionate about what you talk about, even if it&#039;s something insignificant, it&#039;s all about how you say it. if you&#039;re thinking about what to say next and what can you say to come off as a cool guy, then stop. <br /><br />be genuinely interested about what she says and be confident and passionate about what you talk about<br /><br />on the other hand, this is me speaking for myself, but if you&#039;re interested in just hooking up with this girl, go for it. however, if you want something serious with her, then by all means back the fuck off lol! there&#039;s no way on earth that I could take a girl who asks me the price of ANYTHING seriously. and about your teacher&#039;s statement, imo it says everything. the fact that someone who is supposed to be a college level educator uses the phrase &quot;she&#039;s out of your league&quot;, means 2 things: 1) your teacher is a washed up tool and is most likely shallow-minded, which leads to point 2) the girls who&#039;s &#039;out of your league&#039; is a stuck-up bitch (sorry for referring about a girl in these terms, but it would kill the momentum if i said girl :(&nbsp; &nbsp;)<br /><br />anyways good luck<br />LL<br />
