				Hi,<br /><br />I have been doing research on shipping techniques and have learned a lot from reading the shipping forum. It seems the best way to ship pills is inside a padded envelope and using MBB. <br /><br />There is something I cannot figure out though. Do vendors actually try to conceal the goods inside the envelope as well? So when it is opened it actually takes effort to find the pills? Obviously you should fill the envelop with something so it looks legit on the outside but it seems to me that when the envelope is opened it is too late already. <br /><br />Hopefully someone can enlighten me!

				If your package gets intercepted, they will find the drugs. They&#039;ve intercepted drugs that were inside sealed soup cans that weighed exactly the same as the real cans so they&#039;ll find your stuff either way... They use an X-Ray so good luck :P The important thing is making the package as inconspicuous as possible on the outside. Hiding the drugs inside is good if you&#039;re shipping to some dude with a controlling wife or someone that lives with his parents or something like that.
