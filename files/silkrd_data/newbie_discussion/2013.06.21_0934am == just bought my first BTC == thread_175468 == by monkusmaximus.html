				I bought mine from spendbitcoins.com (Australia; perhaps USA valid? Someone may be able to verify) - In SR wallet roughly and hour after &quot;Cash over counter deposit&quot; at one of the company&#039;s recommended banks. It seems like your waiting an extended period of time which is unnecessary in my opinion.<br /><br />Anyway once you get your BTCs cleared and into your SR wallet, you will be up and ready to rock! I&#039;m sure you are already shopping around spending your coins before you even got them :-p I know that I did, haha :p<br /><br />Goodluck! (You wont need it) =p

				BLUE SKY TRADERS IS THE WAY TO GO!!!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />seriously though... process just took me 20 min (going to my bank, withdrawing the cash, going to BofA and depositing it) EASY. I didn&#039;t write a lick of info (about myself (real or fake)) on the slip and they didn&#039;t care! They asked me what it was for and I said I was paying back a loan in a lump-some to avoid interest. Once again they DONT care. shit is easy and they are happy to help you&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />still waiting on my BC but hey it&#039;s only been about 30 min so im cool<br /><br />BST is the way to go!

				I went with Coinbase as well because I like the idea of buying coins with a bank transfer, but it took 7 days to actually get the coins. Not using them again.

				Blue Sky Traders was always easy, fast, and safe. But they haven&#039;t been open for days, saying they can&#039;t get any inventory. Hopefully they&#039;ll get up and going again soon, and meanwhile some vendors on Localbitcoins offer the same bank cash deposit arrangement. But expect to pay 7-10 dollars over the current Mt. Gox exchange rate...

				So far I have used Coinbase for all of my bit coin purchases. Yes, they are excruciatingly slow. However, I am rather mobility impaired, by my r foot being broken. I can&#039;t drive, and my tardis has been in the shop since rocks turned into dirt. So Coinbase has been the viable option for my particular situation.

				I just jumped into this game starting today.&nbsp; As per usual, I am late to the party! 8^)&nbsp; I went through Coin Base, as it seemed fairly secure, although it does take a hot minute for the transfer.&nbsp; That is ok, though.&nbsp; Better slow than shady.&nbsp; Now if I can just figure out this PGP thing, I think I will be OK.
