				Hello all!!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find I&#039;ve been frustrating myself recently with the amount of time I&#039;ve been putting into actually researching everything. I am spending a bonkers amount of time on the process itself and have yet to make a move on an order.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#039;ve invested about 20 hours or so reading the fourms and browsing the road.. this does include looking into vendors.. but I still have yet to make the step to do a purchase.<br /><br />How about the rest of yas?

				I have been registered here for 7+ days and have not still made order because of many circumstances. I read almost everything in wiki, a lot of threads here about security, shipping, delivery, payment, escrow, best product, vendors and so on. Now I am waiting to get my bitcoins and I think I will order today or tomorrow.

				Don&#039;t rush into it. I spend a few days lurking here reading stories/experiences from other members, learning pgp/bitcoins , it is very important to learn how stuff works before you get involved. Also it&#039;s better to start small , no big orders at least untill you get comfortable with the whole process.

				I was introduced by a friend, made an account and ordered late that evening after doing enough research to be willing to separate myself from a few bitcoins. I have yet to receive my first couple order but will be a avid user of the site once everything comes through like planned. Good luck and happy ordering!

				From the time I was shown SR to my first purchase, about three months elapsed. <br /><br />Spent no less than a week just downloading books and gleaning knowledge of a world that once seemed fantasy, almost mythical to me. Learned how to run Tor very discreetly, how to acquire &amp; use Bitcoins anonymously,&nbsp; did my research on what vendors to trust and order from without getting scammed or seized by customs. <br /><br />Got several friends to front me cash for what I promised would be the most pure MDMA they&#039;d ever try. Against my instincts, greed got the better of me and I FE with high expecations for the 15g of molly sold by Tony76 on the 4/20 sale last year. <br /><br />Harsh lesson for my first purchase. Haha.&nbsp; :-X

				Over a year for me. Discovered this place in Nov 2011, set up and account and then watched and learned for awhile. I was a bit leary with the whole bitcoin thing, and then getting shit delivered straight to my house.<br /><br />Then a RL friend of mine told me she had ordered off here and how easy it was, so I finally took the plunge a few weeks ago, and sure enough it really was that easy.<br /><br />One thing I don&#039;t get, is some of the vendor listings ask you to send your address via PGP, yet when you place the order, it asks you for your address, which I put in, and that&#039;s always been good enough for these vendors. What&#039;s the point of the PGP address?

				I did a lot of research too.&nbsp; It took about a month and there was very many hours to make a decision.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t help getting timed out having to start over sometimes either.

				I didn&#039;t get the balls to actually order until there was stuff I wanted that I couldn&#039;t find in person. Despite all the success people have had, shipping pot still seems sketchy to me.

				Was told about SR by a friend. Researched it when it randomly popped into my head about a month later while I was bored. Made an account and did my research on the forums and learned PGP and what not. Acquired some bitcoins &amp; I then placed my first order this week after about 1.5 weeks. Lets see how it goes! Good luck to all newbs!
