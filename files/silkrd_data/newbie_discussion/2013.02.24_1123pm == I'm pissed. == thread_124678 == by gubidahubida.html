				What the fuck is this bullshit? I&#039;ve been a member FOR OVER A YEAR and just because I don&#039;t post often I&#039;m suddenly no longer allowed to post? This is fucking retarded. I am IRATE. I&#039;ve given thousands of dollars of business and I CAN&#039;T EVEN POST A FUCKING REVIEW OF THE DRUGS I JUST BOUGHT :(<br /><br />I&#039;ve been around for a long time. I&#039;ve given business, I&#039;ve reviewed samples, I&#039;ve helped new vendors start up, I&#039;ve introduced dozens of people to this website to increase business. All that and when I go to write a damn review for one of the many products I&#039;ve purchased I find that I&#039;m not allowed?? I&#039;m a &quot;newbie&quot;?? If you want to stop the spammers then don&#039;t block out people who&#039;ve been members for over a year with them.<br /><br />-gub

				Instead of crying like a little whiny kid you could just read the rules which state, that you need 50 posts to write in the forums.<br />Doesn&#039;t matter how much drugs you&#039;ve bought here. Your forum account is not linked to your SR account.<br /><br />Get 50 posts<br />Post.<br /><br />Stop the raging here.<br /><br />Peace

				When I first found the silk road back in the day I was absolutely astonished that something like this existed. I found it through a friend of a friends intel, that led me through some research, which led me to find the silk road. Back in the day, silkroadvb5piz3r used to be a long string of gibberish that you would never be able to remember.

				My best decision ever was to buy 10g of Dutchaanbod&#039;s MDMA. BEST MOLLY EVER. Literally made like 100 people&#039;s nights dutch so thanks for supplying. I gave free molly to so many people I can&#039;t even count. They all said it was the best roll of their life. Still have three or four doses in a drawer somewhere for a rainy day.

				Anyway more about me...<br /><br />My main interests in life are philosophical pursuits and the acquirement of knowledge. I love creative minds and deep thinking. I recently purchased a book written by Carl Jung, and plan to read it soon. Jung has some theories that coincide with some of my own theories. I have been in the process of developing theories of life for the last few years and I believe I&#039;m close to being finished and will then showcase these theories to the world, at which point things will never be the same.

				I&#039;m thinking we should be grateful that this site is even in existence, and the DPR has done a wonderful job with basically everything.<br /><br />If you think about it, there is probably other black markets out there with shittier interface and more sketchy features, which is why people are flocking to SR. To get upset (or irate) over a simple forum rule is lame, dude.

				God is real, only we created him. It&#039;s evolution, really. An omniscient being was formed by our consciousness and exists through us all. It exists to keep us from killing ourselves in our reckless nature while at the same time attempting to be subtle enough to not have its existence be conspicuous. It knows what we would do to it if we only knew it existed with enough certainty to merit scientific attention.

				In light of this, reincarnation is very real. However each reincarnated &quot;soul&quot;, to use a cliched term, is constructed from bits and pieces of other &quot;souls&quot;. Really there is no soul to begin with, only pieces of a whole--pieces that can be reshaped and reconstructed.

				Some psychics are real, because we all happen to be connected on this &quot;grid&quot; of conscious information. MANY are not real and are simply delusional or unethical.

				We don&#039;t suffer infinite nonexistence upon death because there is no such thing. If we exist, presently then the only explanation is that we have always existed and always will.
