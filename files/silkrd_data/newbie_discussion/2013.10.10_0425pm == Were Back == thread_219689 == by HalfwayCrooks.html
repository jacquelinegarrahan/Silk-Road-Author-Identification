				After the shutdown we have been very cautious. We have opened a new Forum account. We also deleted our PGP. We have been looking on the alternative websites and quite frankly we are unimpressed. We know fine that feds will be all over it. So we shut up shop but anyone who is desperate and has ordered with us before message me on this and we can work something out over privnote. All orders placed with us the day before Silk went down were not sent out. If you made a order with us and can prove this we will send it out. Please if you contact us through the pm system use PrivNote. We will be using BMR Or Sheep in a later date when it has upgraded a little more. We are sorry to all customers that were let down, But we are back.<br /><br />HalfwayCrooks

				These are the kind of sellers the world needs more of, not just taking the money and running. Pm me in a day or too and join us.
