				Hey there, If I ordered a small amount of weed UK domestic and it didn&#039;t turn up, i.e it was seized in the post office. What should I expect? An encounter with LE? A letter to my door? Just curious about what I should do if my weed did get seized. Thanks in advance for your advice&nbsp; ;D

				Not really sure how far they will take this, but whatever happens, deny, deny, deny.<br /><br />People can send you anything you want whether you request it or not.&nbsp; You are NOT responsible for what arrives in the mail.

				Depends on how much you ordered, but if it was a small enough amount you&#039;ll more than likely get a letter.&nbsp; :o

				Well don&#039;t really wanna say how much it was but if I was caught with that IRL I think I&#039;d just get a warning or a fine. There&#039;s no way even they could say that amount could be considered dealing.

				This amount would for sure be classified as personal.

				Well not sure if it is an officer dressed as a mailman or your normal mailman. Basically they&#039;re getting you to sign for your package so they can say you signed for it in the knowledge of what it was. If they just gave it to you or didn&#039;t deliver it it&#039;s really easy to deny it&#039;s yours.
