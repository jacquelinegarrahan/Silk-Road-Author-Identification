				Hi,<br />I want to order a large amount of pills to usa and i would ship them to a friends house but understandibly he&#039;s a little worried. But I told him that as long as he doesn&#039;t open the pack, they can&#039;t convict him of anything since anybody in the world could send you anything they want. Am I right with that? So basically, as long as I don&#039;t open the package I haven&#039;t done anything illegal right? So if they do a controlled delivery, which they would for sure do in case they find it, its alright.<br />Thanks for your advice.

				and also, i would order them from Anton Koellisch so they&#039;re coming from netherlands and everyone knows that thats a higher risk country but i have a friend who i would trust with my life in germany. Do you guys think its smart to order the pills to him and then he sends them from there to the US or does it make no difference? ( i would lose my refund right)

				It probably won&#039;t make a difference.<br />The Dutch vendors know they&#039;re a higher risk country when exporting, and they&#039;re not&nbsp; stupid either, it&#039;ll most probably be very well disguised.&nbsp; After all, the Dutch are world experts in pill/mdma smuggling.<br />The Netherlands exports huge quantities of shit that isn&#039;t drugs too remember.&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally never had a problem with ordering from Holland.<br /><br />But after all, it&#039;s up to you, but you shouldn&#039;t coerce your friend into it too strongly, but it is a much safer bet, just don&#039;t send him any texts or anything that could link the dots.<br /><br />My 2c

It sounds logical, but technically he&#039;d be in possession of the drugs and so he could easily be arrested.

Ordering drugs is always a gamble. No matter what precautions you take. Both of you have to know this going in, but most likely as long as he didn&#039;t sign for anything, you would both be fine.<br /><br />I agree with following the no texts to link the dots advice; better safe than sorry.
