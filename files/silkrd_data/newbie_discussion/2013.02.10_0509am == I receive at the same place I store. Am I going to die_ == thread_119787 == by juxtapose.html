				It isn&#039;t hard to stash things off of your own property. Don&#039;t be fucking lazy or you will regret it. If you keep anything at your house make sure it&#039;s misdemeanor amounts and just refill when needed.

				If you are just receiving personal amounts, you should be fine with receiving and storing at your home. If you are receiving large amounts, I would definitely recommend either having someone else receiving or have someone willing to let you hide unmarked boxes in their attic. Get creative with your stashing! With most items, it is primarily smell that is the most difficult thing to deal with. There are odor proof bags you can get to help with that though.

				while its tough to stay away from &quot;misdemeanor&quot; amounts on the road.&nbsp; most things are felony worthy at a pinch.&nbsp; pot sure,&nbsp; thats small time.<br /><br />out of a dozen receiptions, 1 rattled (script pillz), and 2 came non-heat sealed (or vac sealed), and in only an extra 1.5&quot; baggie to hold another bag of contents for my plants.&nbsp; bonzai and the lot.&nbsp; of those 2, only 1 concerned me.

				I have some serious experience from shipping.&nbsp; I have seen to many people catch 4-6 extra felonies from not keeping their shit under wraps.&nbsp; I would advise to at least use the &quot;hole&quot; strategy... Bury that shit&nbsp; &nbsp; at least 1000 feet away
