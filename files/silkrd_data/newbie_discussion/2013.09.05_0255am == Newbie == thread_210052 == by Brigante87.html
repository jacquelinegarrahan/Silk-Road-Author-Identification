				Just joined SR and I&#039;m really confused about how to use escrow, bitcoins, etc. Just thought I would put this out there in case anyone would be willing/able to help.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I suggest getting bitcoins through vendors with money pak while you are new and until you learn how to get bitcoin properly. All you do is literally find a vendor (cheechdeals777 is who I use, tell him I sent you) but you can use anyone else. Make sure they have bitcoin available and check their minimum. cheechdeals777 has the lowest minimum which is 250 bucks I believe. He will charge you 10% of that which is $25. You go to walgreens or 711 and ask for moneypak, you load the money onto the card, and then you go to silk road and buy their listing for bitcoin and in the address field you give them the amount that you put on the card and you give them the serial number for the money pak card. They will literally transfer bitcoin directly to your account within 12 hours maximum. This is obviously a bit of a fee, but I suggest doing it this way until you really know what your doing. I know what I am doing and I pay these guys this way to get the bitcoins quickly and directly to my account. You want to make sure vendors have enough transactions and a solid 5/5 if you&#039;re going to purchase from them. You don&#039;t want to risk getting ripped off. Also, since your new they will most likely ask you to FE (finalize early) which means instantly release the money to the vendor before they ship the product to you. This ensure you are not scamming them. All the escrow is, is a middle man (silk road) which holds onto your money. Once you receive your product you should IMMEDIATELY release the funds to the vendor. You can bet your ass that you won&#039;t do any more business with anyone if you wait&nbsp; a while to release funds or let SR autofinalize the funds for you after 17 days. Basically all you need to know is bitcoin and pgp which is wayyyy easier then it sounds. All you do is take the vendors public key, copy and paste onto a pgp encryption website, and then encrypt your address by literally pressing encrypt. You copy this big jumbled mess of code that doesn&#039;t make any sense and paste it into the address field when ordering. The vendor can only decrypt your address with this code (no one else can). So if SR is compromised your address isn&#039;t floating around. Just go on google and search how to use silk road and there are good tutorials. It&#039;s super fucking easy once you learn. I know this is a big mess of run on sentences and mixed ideas, but hey what the hell I thought I&#039;d try to help someone new out. I didn&#039;t have anyone to help me when I first signed up. I hope you learn it and stay safe. Take things nice and slow. Peace.

				Thanks BigPopPag! That advice was much needed. Now I have to weigh out the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of choosing home delivery or P.O. Box. Appreciate it

Appreciate it<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hi there, <br /><br />I am also a newbie (1st post yay!). Despite being a &quot;discreet&quot; user of the internet since &#039;98, it literally took me this long to figure out such a system existed all on my own. I was a personal trainer for 6 years and my bf broke down in desperation to ask me if there was anyway I could provide certain performance enhancing drugs for him. I found the TSR as a result and couldn&#039;t be happier. However, I too am curious as to if a P.O. box is considered &quot;safer&quot; than a personal address. Ultimately, I don&#039;t think it would take a dedicated investigator to figure out who exactly held any account, thus not important but still I had to inquire. I&nbsp; have read everything in regard to the wiki page and bitcoins starter guide, yet I am still unsure about the process. These threads are really helpful though and have instilled a greater confidence in me. I look forward to working with many of you in the future :)
