				NjqgjC6n6, what are you interested in specifically ? <br />Will not be able to ship saturday and monday due to workload IRL - if not this morning;&nbsp; tuesday is the next shipping date.<br />I sent out the first letters saturday, I expect at least 10 feedbacks until beginning of next week. <br />Orders to czech, france and germany arrived already. I shipped to northern ireland and great britain amongst other european countries so you might have an estimate of how good the stealth is.<br />Maybe wait until the feedback has arrived to be sure. three users have confirmed their delivery already. one more&nbsp; arrived on wednesday

				I have ordered 2x the 100mg Meth (large shards) late Friday evening. Little test drive here. Due to the information on the vendor page I´m not expecting the delivery in the next days, probably mid- to end of next week. Right now it´s in processing. Although I´m not an expert on meth I will definetly share my experiences here regarding shipping and quality in this review thread. Cannot give a detailed description but can at least compare it to the handfull of times I used meth from other vendors (mostly private). So, my honest review will follow as soon as I got the gear.<br />Nice weekend everybody.

				@NjqgjC6n6<br />sure, if you havent ordered already, feel free to do so.<br />The rule is there to help me against late finalization and missing feedbacks. If you manage to leave a feedback and finalize in a timely manner Id be happy to have you as a customer. <br />@wwizard: <br />There were a lot available. I cant remember seeing any more the last time I looked but need to look again, that might take a week or two. Will keep you posted.<br />@theforgotten:<br />everything is packed now and will be going out later today.<br />

				Okay, as promised my update with the experiences I had with &quot;uhrwerk&quot;. The 2x0,1 Meth arrived yesterday, even a day faster as expected (due to the explanations on his vendor page). The Quality is simply perfect, little shards but not too much crushed. I think that guy pretty much knows what he´s talking about. Many of you may share my feelings when ordering from him because he was pretty new, and you never knoe if it´s not the cops who deliver your parcel. I can guarantee you this is not the case! I already consider him a highly trustworthy vendor, always open for questions and quick replies to messages. Conclusion: A vendor who knows his products and is highly interested in selling the best quality available, nice person and good communication. I will definately buy again! I think uhrwerk is gonna be on SR for a long time, so give him a try!I did not regret it!!<br />theforgotten

				ok, MBBs (moisture barrier bags) have arrived and are used after vaccuum sealing for hashish and amphetamine paste.<br />If someone cares about double sealing crystalline substances without an odourl I will do so but I am of the opinion that one MBB is enough for these, which will be done.<br />will add speed paste, MDPV and LSD (blotters and bottles with 100drops) on thursday. In the meanwhile, I would like to have your opinion on the question:<br /><br />how much acid would you like on a blotter? Ive read that another vendor here claims he has got 300mcg on them but I think it is A LOT to take. <br />my personal liking is somewhere around 100-150mcg but if its not iso- oder lumi LSD (and thereby degenerated), even this is not as easy to control while you still have to take care of things IRL.<br /><br />let me know what you think. otherwise it will be 100-120mcg.<br /><br />cheers

				-added spongebob blotters with 115mcg each.<br />-added new pictures of materials I didnt photograph yet. thing is,&nbsp; the site uses 400x300pixel pictures but although I tried to scale them according to this standard, they appear to be messed up. Please let me know if somethings really bad, I will update them asap. It takes quite some time to prepare these and its late now.

				Hi,<br /><br />Your product list looks very interesting. I like to collect as many different RC&#039;s as possible, so it&#039;s nice to see a European vendor offering a good range.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t managed to find a good source of bitcoins in the uk yet, but when I do, I&#039;ll be trying a few of your goodies.<br /><br />Up until now, I&#039;ve been buying my RC&#039;s with cash in post. Don&#039;t like doing it..... last thing I bought was a bunch of DOC and it was hard work. so glad I&#039;ve discovered Silk Road :)<br /><br />Good luck bro!

				@westb0xes:<br />I should off some 5 and 10 packs with a lowered price, you need to subtract the price for hedging and escrow, both of which I have to pay. This makes it a little more expensive than the average &quot;street price&quot;. Also, I guarantee you there is 115mcg inside, titrated by me, which makes them a little stronger than the average drop of alleged 100mcg.<br /><br />@sante:<br />I am not trading explosives, everything you need to make bombs can be purchased at the local workshop. I met too many people over the years that seriously hurt themselves with inoraganic and organic explosives and the shock from those sudden explosions made them psychologically fragile as well, sometimes more so than victims of drug abuse.<br /><br />@Töörländer:<br />I could offer them but I dont really like the idea of a bottle half full, as ~two drop will adhere to the wall. By now, the 100drop bottles are calculated so that they have ~110drops inside. I would be willing to sell 55 drops as 50 but the price would be a little higher. If you want to purchase smaller amounts, The spongebob blotters I offer are dripped with surgical precision by me, they are not laid in a solution and dried like most commercial blotter. So I can guarantee the values of 115mcg each. Also, after drying, they are directly packed in MBB to avoid unnecessary oxygen exposure.<br /><br /><br />DPR wrote, there is ongoing DDoS attacks against the site and they are working on a solution.<br />&quot;UPDATE (04/24/2013 0714 UTC): The downtime of the past couple days, and especially the past 24 hours has been confirmed to be due to a deliberate attack from what appears to be an individual.&nbsp; There appears to be no security breach, only disruption of availability.&nbsp; The attack appears to be DoS in nature and is likely an exploit at the Tor network level.&nbsp; The site will be down or very slow until a solution can be found, which we will work tirelessly to find.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience.&quot;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151563.0<br /><br />There is no chance I could have logged in for the past 16h.

				&nbsp;I can offer you 10 bottles for 5750USD, which, after commission and hedging, would equal to 400eu for me per bottle. <br />Have sent the first bottles out monday, to an EU country with tight customs. Maybe the receiver could comment over here once received?!<br />What country are you in ? I send out of .DE. The bottles are not made of glass, which apparently gives problems in customs.

				Hey there! Just wanted to give a little review on my order of 10g afghani hash.<br /><br />I contacted Uhrwerk beforehand because I had less than 5 transactions, but it was okay for him and I finalized early because I offered him that.<br />The shipping was extremely quick (1 day domestic) and arrived safely. The stealth was good but not perfect, maybe a little too much.<br />The product itself is a nice and clean afghani hash, not too strong but stronger as most afghani hash today (i&#039;m a daily smoker) with a nice classic afghani taste.<br /><br />hq pictures:<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/3fzx.jpg<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/hCfE.jpg<br /><br />Definitely looking forward to checking out his blotters, but looking for some reviews first!

				@Minchia:<br />I propose 700USD<br />@biboba:<br />thanks for the very good pictures and your honest feedback! <br />I can guarantee you the blotters are worth it, it is the only thing I take and prepare personally and they are not derived from some wholesale where the whole sheets are dipped into a large container. I am working on a follow up to the current shipping method, but people will need some time to extract the goods from the packaging. I dont know if people are willing to invest 20-30minutes but I think it is an upgrade to the current shipping method and totally worth it.

				Hi,<br /><br />My first order on SR was from this vendor, for some 2C-E.<br /><br />The product arrived within 3 days of placing the order. I&#039;m very satisfied with the speed of the transaction.<br /><br />The 2C-E was excellent. I didn&#039;t even try a full dose. Just snorted about 4mg to test the quality (snorting 2C-x compounds is NOT recommended. The burn is like being kicked in the nose by a psychedelic donkey)..... and was reminded just why 2C-E is one of Shulgin&#039;s &quot;magical half-dozen&quot;.<br /><br />Good product, good vendor...... highly recommended :)

				my review of Uhrwerk German vendor<br /><br />I ordered 1 gram 3-mmc delivery time 4 days to Nl,vendor is very friendly and good communication for me this is very important,<br />so til thus far he,s a professional vendor also his stealth is brilliant:-) I will not go into details that speaks for itself,first thing what cross my mind when i opened the package this isn,t my post.<br />So today i tried his product ( i wanted to buy 4-mmc but he didn,t sell this if it still exist or sold,at least this vendor is honest,i was too late for an labtest so didn,t want to wait a week to try product.(and ez test give limited results).so i took the risk the first line gave me good euphoric&nbsp; feelings talkative&nbsp; but short wish it would be longer,and stronger ( 3-mmc is the light version of 4-mmmc). becouse the lack of quality Cocaine this is a good alternative.When i get to restless i just take an downer/oxazepam. I,m fan from only 2 vendors thet,s says enough,so Uhrwerk i hope you continue this approach than Silk road become a better place.. anyway judge for yourself he has great feedback,all satiesfied customers..!!!<br />So now i know how 3-mmc feels:-)so i can compare in the future,also i found out that plugging (taking meph rectal) works 3x stronger!!

				welcome back ladies and gentlemen, <br />thanks to DPR and the team working tirelessly to present a solution, the shop is open again. <br />- can&#039;t update my vendor profile as of now so the information below is binding;<br />- last order accepted for the next shipping date is Thursday, 2nd of May, 1pm and will be shipped the very same day, <br />- I have sent out every order Monday, (unless we agreed upon sending Thursday) believing in users (and the site) although my instinct told me to wait until I can at least mark them &quot;in transit&quot;.<br />- will now mark every order in transit until tomorrow morning so to not have orders cancel on me because they access the site faster after a downtime and cancel orders though they have received them...

				I&#039;m kind of intrigued by your strychnine.. Is it for use as a poison or what kind of nootropic effects does it have? Do you have any personal experience with it? I&#039;d be interested in trying something so exotic but it seems pretty dangerous..

				@wwizard: according to a reliable private communication, strychnine has been used as a stimulant in doses of 0,5-2mg as a stimulant in the early 20th century. Will go into the research later to back this statement up but the individual communicating this is very literate in chemical history, I lost touch with him over the years so it will be hard to find the exact source. I noticed there is no mentioning of this in wiki, where it is treated as a poison only. will update late, might need to go to my books, that are not around where I am now.

				http://cenblog.org/2010/02/gimme-that-old-time-poisonin/<br />The strychnine mention recalled a lecture on poisons I attended several years ago. The professor who gave the lecture told the crowd that the lecture was a favorite of undergrads. I could see why. He started off dramatic, pacing the front of the room with a white coffee mug filled with water and a small, non-lethal (he assured us) dose of strychnine. Then he had us dip a finger in the mug and taste it. I am not making this up. Whatever was in that mug was bitter almost to the point of gagging. The professor explained that at a lethal dose of strychnine, the bitterness would be overwhelming, so it wasn’t a perfect poison, as poisons go. The stuff probably was strychnine- The Merck Index writes that a solution containing as little as 1 part strychnine to 700,000 parts of water will still taste bitter.<br />Brucine, the alkaloid mentioned above, is a little less bitter than strychnine (the threshold for tasting bitterness in the tetrahydrate is 1:220,000, again per the Merck Index). But I’m guessing that for the poor souls drinking that bootlegged swill, bitterness was the least of their problems.<br />commentary: <br />operation counterstrike;<br />Strychnine was a recreational drug in the first part of the Twentieth Century. In HG Wells’ THE INVISIBLE MAN the title character uses it. It was a performance enhancer, like speed.<br />Carmen Drahl<br />@OpC- Thanks for the HG Wells reference. Yet another book I’ve yet to read.<br />From the Project Gutenberg e-book:<br />“After a time I crawled home, took some food and a strong dose of strychnine, and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed. Strychnine is a grand tonic, Kemp, to take the flabbiness out of a man.”<br />“It’s the devil,” said Kemp. “It’s the palaeolithic in a bottle.”<br />“I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable. You know?”<br />“I know the stuff.”<br />---<br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/may/30/drugsinsport.olympicgames<br />good read, there is a lot about strychnine, in particular ;<br />&quot;While Lorz had used a car as a quick fix, Hicks had used, well, a quick fix. His trainer afterwards admitted they had decided &quot;to inject him with a milligram of sulphate of strychnine and to make him drink a large glass brimming with brandy&quot;. Hicks then &quot;set off again as best he could&quot;. But one hit was not enough. &#039;&#039;He needed another injection four miles from the end to give him a semblance of speed and to get him to the finish.&#039;Hicks kept his medal, a decision possibly influenced by the embarrassment Lorz had already caused. The leniency also reflected the fact that doping, and strychnine abuse in particular, was commonplace at the time. Now the drug seems so archaic that Hicks&#039;s story has a certain twisted humour. But the ramifications of its use were just as obnoxious as those of HGH and steroids are today.<br />---<br />from a sad article ; (someone died becuase of an overdose of it)<br />http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fears-men-died-after-taking-rat-poison-as-leisure-drug/2008/02/28/1203788539307.html<br />Strychnine, derived from a plant, is used in rat poison and is highly toxic. In humans, it causes convulsions of every muscle, with death coming after two or three hours from suffocation or sheer exhaustion. In smaller doses, strychnine has been used as a performance-enhancing or recreational substance. The winner of the first Olympic marathon was found to have drunk a mixture of strychnine and brandy before the race. Professor George Braitberg, an emergency medicine and toxicology expert at Southern Health, said the chemical was a feature of ancient rituals in the Americas. &quot;A lot of plants have been used in that way, including peyote and strychnine and mushrooms — those sort of things,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s not really a drug — there is no medical reason to be using strychnine. It&#039;s not converted into medication. &quot;It&#039;s a plant that causes poisoning.&quot;<br />---<br />http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/napoleon/c_junkie.html<br />&quot;At the beginning of the 19th century, most of today&#039;s recreational drugs were not known in Europe. (...) Instead, the recreational drugs of Europeans were extraordinary to our modern thinking: such things as arsenic, strychnine and antimony.&quot;

				Wow it seems pretty interesting... So a dose would be 1 or 2mg? Does that little also work orally? If so, that&#039;d be a pretty cheap performance enhancer. It seems everyone takes it with alcohol, is it because it would cause convulsions otherwise? If so, combining your veronal and strychnine could make a pretty interesting experience!

				@wwizard: <br />common sense dictates to not combine them on their first date, as both of them are rather delicate on their own. I would certainly like to have some neuroleptics with me in case Stychnine is more powerful than I expect but then again, my Satorius is accurate down to 0,01mg so it would certainly be possible to properly measure allergy dosages. Would start with 0,25mg (á la Hofmann). If thats not working, wait 4-5days and repeat with 0,5mg If you have read the texts I quoted above, at one point there is a mentioning of the bitterness of the compound, which is 700,000:1. that goes analogue to the Scoville&nbsp; scale. 1mg is still noticeably bitter in 700mL water. wow.

				What is a satorius? You could even weigh LSD on a scale that precise! O.o Such a scale must cost thousands.. I&#039;d have to make a solution to be able to take tiny amounts like that, my only scale being +/- 10mg :/ It would suck if it&#039;s that bitter though. I would have to do a lidocaine mouthwash first or something.. Or inject it. But injecting something known as a poison is a little offsetting. I wouldn&#039;t want to have instant convulsions and not be able to take an anticonvulsant in time.. If it&#039;s as bitter as capsaicin is pungent I don&#039;t think drinking 1mg in 1mL would be a very pleasant experience. I guess I would have to make some kind of blotter-like thing and put it in a gelcap.

Such a scale must be pretty interesting! <br />I was thinking of asking you exactly how much you would send me too since you say all your orders are overweight. I would like a little 2mg sample :) you could get a first hand account of its effects that way, I&#039;d write a detailed reports for each dose I&#039;d try. 2mg in solid form would be pretty hard to find in a letter though, but a liquid would be hard to disguise... I&#039;ll contact you when SR is back up, and PGP won&#039;t be a problem.

				@Zoohara:<br />When I started to read your post, I almost anticipated the first bad feedback. I am glad this is not the case and you enjoyed the acid, everything else would have riddled me.<br />Apparently, it makes a difference that they are not &quot;laid&quot; as a whole sheet, which I find highly unpredictable&nbsp; in individual dosage and object to completely. One cannot expect them to be properly spread.&nbsp; I take the time to pipette every single drop onto them, which is tedious- but I can guarantee their homogeneity. once the alcohol is evaporated, I pack them directly into the MBB, so to minimize friction and avoid exposure to air and humidity. I would like to claim that they are as fresh as it gets. I have seen my share of blotter at wholesale;&nbsp; most of the vendors know what they are doing but they still forget about the miniscule amount of crystal that has crystallized into the paper. friction is very bad for it as you wouldn&#039;t even be able to see the paper losing its crystals when handled.

Basically, I had 300 transactions within a month as the first month was used to set up my security. If you knew how I packed my packages, you can believe me it feels like a year already.

I have seen my share of DMT and the quality and dryness are above average. If any user having ordered the DMT would elaborate on the material here in this thread ?<br /><br />please see for yourself!<br />1g listing<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/0b2c7a9d89<br />0,1g listing :<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/05bcb469f0

				the material was slightly red, I would put it between the silver and the lavender quality, it is indeed more potent than the last silver crystal imho, but you have to decide for yourself. The solution of the drops doesn&#039;t have a red, but a yellow hue.<br /><br />I offered the spokesperson and some other guy on the LSD avengers thread to test my material but they didnt even reply to my PMs. I dont like the attitude to not even answer my mails at all, but I can understand that there might be vendors that send them different materials than they sell to users.<br />I have to tell you I dont need to position myself in a crowd of people with that attitude TBH.<br /><br />All users that have ordered with me know about the quality and service I offer. <br />As you have stated already (:D) I am comparably new and want to give new customers the ability to report about their experience with me without having to spam the forum. <br /><br />Me selling a wide variety of material is not a rumor, so I tend to not not post over there.

				Hey there :) <br /><br />First of all, big thanks out to Uhrwerk for the fast and uncomplicated transaction !<br /><br />I ordered one single LSD-Spongebob-Blotter, which is declared as a 115micro-Trip. Only after one day i received the Letter, which was absolutely unobtrusive. Really nice and lovely looking Vacuum Seal. <br /><br />The Vendor answered all my questions really fast (mostly after some hours or even instantly) and seems to be a really nice and trustable person to deal with. When talking to him i recognized, that he really has a green thump concerning chemistry, so i suppose the Trip will be a absolutely pure experience. <br /><br />Though i didnt came in contact with Spongebob yet, i have no doubt averything will be fine. As i did, i will write a complete Trip report, here in the forum, because imho its really important to know what you may expect and further great work needs to be appreciated ! <br /><br />Finally i can tell you for sure, especially when you order for the first time, stick to him. Best regards and much Love out there :)

				I received a free sample of strychnine from uhrwerk today, it took a bit more than a week to get there.<br /><br />So far everything has been great! The communication is absolutely outstanding, he answers really fast and in a friendly manner. He even offered me a free sample just because I was interested in what strychnine could be like, something that&#039;s never happened with other vendors.<br /><br />The stealth was really good IMO, I don&#039;t see why you would need to change it. The two little vials are sealed in MBB and the package doesn&#039;t look suspicious at all. Maybe it&#039;s a little big so more expensive to send.<br /><br />Overal 7/5 for this transaction for which I didn&#039;t even have to pay for shipping! <br /><br />I&#039;ll try the strychnine over the next few days and write an experience report about this rare substance for those of you that are interested.

				Hey there! :)<br /><br />Just tried a bit of your crystal meth and I must say this stuff is very strong and on par with the best stuff I&#039;ve been using. A 5 mg mini-dose already gives its desired effects. Did myself a bit more insufflated, this is only two days after a large binge and quite frequent use as of late.<br /><br />I really hope you will be selling more of this god stuff internationally (or at least within europe). Bought only 100 mg to test, but am willing to buy more ideally! :)<br /><br />The product was indeed a bit overweight as stated the shipping very fast. Recommended seller.<br /><br />Thank you!!! :D

				You should try to get in contact with the avengers again. It would really help you move a lot more lsd.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious if you would consider selling a sheet or two (100) tabs of LSD that are rated around 75ug. I&#039;m looking for a vendor that has real lsd for cheap. Since people dont understand that the 150-200ug tabs I get should be worth more than the 50ug tabs they get else where I might as well go down in potency and lower prices.

				thanks for the positive attitude guys!<br /><br />@wizzard; I am really astonished it took so long to your neighbouring EU-country. You should be able to see the stamp I shipped it when I told you, there is a lot of packages late at the moment. Have heard nothing about a workstrike in Germany. can you imagine how long I spend all day every day to prepare this very shipping method ? I sure would love to employ someone to prepare them for me, but on the other hand I feel bad for each and every item I abuse this way, so I wanted to change the shipping for faster processing times.<br /><br />@KawaiiDesu; I imagine you received the material in the plastic flasks (Eppendorf reaction flasks of 0,5mL or 2mL) ? Or did you get the material directly packed in MBB that I used for the first time on Monday? <br />both the small and the large crystals are from the same reaction and the same workup. someone today got material with the new shipping method. he received the large crystals but although he ordered the third time already, he didnt even recognize the material as what it is... (maybe the two times before had an effect on his judgement, if I am allowed to say so :D )<br /><br />There is a little meth left, I will take the time to pack all of the remaining material up and put it online. Hash is gone for good now, hopefully, my contact will return in winter and supply me with new great hash. Am thinking about adding good weed but am in negotiations with a supplier.<br /><br />

I have to prepare some blotters anyway, if you upload a picture with a good resolution at 3,5x3,5cm or 7x7cm you can have your custom image, as I am not going to drop them on spongebobs. my blotter are 7x7mm. A 25- or 100-strip picture is no problem for me to produce.<br />I am not interested in moving it faster than it is going already, as my supply is limited atm. more is ordered. if the guys at the LSD avengers are not interested in new members, I leave them to their attitude. As I said I contacted two individuals to no extend. There is nothing I am willing to do now.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Title: <strong>Strychnine free sample experience report.</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>wwizard</strong> on <strong>May 19, 2013, 08:34 pm</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				(TLDR, just read the last paragraph)<br /><br />I received 2 little vials each containing 1.046mg of strychnine dissolved in 0.2mL of 46% ethanol.<br /><br />On my first trial, as advised by him, I took half of a vial, so approximately 0.5mg. <br /><br />I dissolved it in a big glass of more than 300mL and it was still pretty bitter and metallic tasting, it wasn&#039;t very enjoyable but it was bearable for me. Even after refilling my glass I could feel its bitterness, it&#039;s incredible how bitter that stuff is.<br /><br />After about 30 minutes I started feeling its first effects, a mild stimulation and all my muscles felt a little more tense. I decided to take a coffee because I was still tired (even speed leaves me tired if I take it in the morning without coffee). <br /><br />Soon after that I start feeling a little restless along with a mild mood elevation, like feeling excited. The coffee definitely amplified its side effects, the tension in my muscles increased and my heart was beating pretty fast. It remained tolerable though.<br /><br />The mood lift didn&#039;t get bigger throughout the day, and the side effects decreased after the caffeine wore off about 5 hours later, while the main effects remained as strong. It definitely indicates a bad synergy between the two.<br /><br />I noticed my senses were heightened throughout the day, I could see things more clearly and hear them with more detail as well, music sounded noticeably better too. There was a definite increase in libido as well without any vasocontriction, which is a pretty good thing. I started coming down in the evening about 12 hours later, I started having a mild headache then. The come down was pretty slow leaving me a little irritable and pretty tired about 14 hours later, which accounted for a nicer than usual sleep.<br /><br /><br />On my second trial, I took all the remaning strychnine, wanting to try a proper dose (1.5mg). <br /><br />30 minutes later I was strongly stimulated and not tired at all, I didn&#039;t need any coffee at all, it&#039;s definitely more stimulating than speed (for me).<br /><br />The side effects mentioned above were only slightly stronger at this dose, I only felt a general tension in my muscles, the other side effects I mentioned above were probably due to the combination of caffeine and strychnine.<br /><br />The feeling of excitement and the elevated mood was stronger though, and so was the increased libido (pretty strongly increased, still no vasocontriction whatsoever) and heightened senses.<br /><br />Physical exercise was a lot easier, I could do 1.5 times as much as I can normally do, that explains why it has been used during the olympics.<br /><br />I started coming down after about 12 hours like the last time, the headache was also there and stronger but nothing really too bad. The irritability was noticeably stronger though but so was the sleepiness, I had a great night of sleep that night.<br /><br /><br />All in all Strychnine is a nice substitute for caffeine and would be good as an everyday stimulant. From the doses I tried though, there&#039;s no real high except a mood elevation, it could probably be used as an antidepressant. <br />I didn&#039;t find it easier to focus on it, so it&#039;s not really nootropic, but I noticed some good performance enhancing effects which is interesting if you want to work out. Maybe in higher doses it&#039;s truly recreational though. Its fairly strong increase in libido also makes it a good aphrodisiac.<br /><br />I would need to try higher doses like 5mg to see if it could be truly recreational, there is definitely some recreational potential from what I tried, maybe the side effects become too prominent at higher doses however.<br /><br />Effects I noticed :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mood elevation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Increase in libido without any vasoconstriction<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Increased stamina, good for physical exercise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Good long lasting stimulation, keeps you awake for the whole day, no appetite suppression<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Causes a better quality of sleep after it wears off, make it easier to fall asleep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Heightened senses, clearer vision, more detailed hearing, music sounds better<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative (only during the comedown except for the last 2)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Headache<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Irritability<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Tachycardia, high blood pressure, with caffeine (I imagine it also happens in higher doses of strychnine alone)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mild general muscle tension<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				Thank you very much for the detailed review wwizard!! As there is no known or accepted antidote for Strychnine known for until today, I strongly advise against using larger amounts without having build up a tolerance. I offer to prepare a solution of every strength asked for. <br />When I was researching the Tryptamines more intensely, I didnt even notice the metallic bitterness that comes with them at some point anymore. You sorta anticipate it with time. I always thought it comes from some synthesis residue, but I am happy that even with the natural compounds, this taste is still present. What I really love about small dosages of tryptamines, especially noticeable with miprocine (4-HO-MIPT) is the enormous mood elevation that comes with small dosages, between 5-15mg. It does still taste pretty bitter if you don&#039;t parachute it. :)<br /><br />I offer these mentioned vials, containing 1.046mg Strychnine.NO3 in 48%EtOH now for sale.<br />

				After having done several transactions with Uhrwerk i think i should leave my thoughts. I have bought his 4MEC, 3MMC and 3MMC crystalized<br /><br />Products: <br />The 3MMC especially crystalised blew my socks off. Wonderfull stuff, enough said. I might even like it more than 4MMC. Good pricing as well. I cannot really comment on the 4MEC other than that it was a bit clumpy but nothing to worry about. You never have to worry about being sold less, it is always a bit overweight, i nfact with the 4MEC i got halve a gram extra.<br /><br />Stealth:<br />I cant believe how much time uhrwerk spends preparing these. Just top notch. Enough variety so it nevers becomes supsicious (it made me laugh a couple of times).<br /><br />Shipping:<br />This is why i will always be a returning customer. Next day delivery and its always the same. I only had one package arrive a couple days later, but the stamp said it was shipped on the day the SR order page said so the mail fucked up. This guy even beats amazon sometimes when it comes to next day delivery. I had mail coming in under 20 hours! Also he doesnt charge alot for the methods he uses to ship, which is only adding up to the balance as a whole.<br /><br />Service:<br />Responds very quickly, always friendly when answering questions. But the biggest plus here is honesty. When he says he cant or can do something he means it, even if it means no sale. I asked him once if he could manage to ship a product today thus it being it delivered to me tomorrow. He kindly answered and denied the possibility due to a holiday.<br /><br />All in all you are one of those sellers that make SR a special place.

				First of all, WORD to BrokeAllStar. 100% the same opinion !<br /><br />2nd Transaction with Uhrwerk. Arrived after 2 days (domestic), but normally it takes only 1 day. Again nice and uncomplicated communication. Again really nice stealth, again perfect vacuum sealing, again nice pricing and ima fucking buy AGAIN as well. Thats what i call a vendor. <br /><br />Trip reports on his 2c-b and LSD follow. For sure :) <br /><br />Best regards, keep it up like this ! Fully valued.

				Dear Uhrwerk,<br /><br />i promised you to write a detailed report about our bulkier transaction. Here we are... <br /><br />First of all i have to praise the unique communication. Every single question he answered in record time! I had some doubts because he&#039;s a relative new vendor but i can tell you all.....HE IS LEGIT! I was a hard customer, but he has always maintained silence (i promise to be more relaxed the next transactions&nbsp; :-X&nbsp; ). It looks like he gave a little extra on every item&nbsp; :-*<br />1 day domestic delivery is absolutely outstanding like the discrete package! I&#039;ll return and hope for a long lasting partnership.<br /><br />Products:<br /><br />Pills are moneymakers like in description and are not overdosed (about 100-120mg)<br />DMT not tested yet, i&#039;ll give you a trip report after testing<br />LSD drops not tested yet, i&#039;ll give you a trip report after testing (his spongebob blotter was as adervtised)<br /><br />Shipping:<br /><br />excellent and faster than light&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Package:<br /><br />discrete as hell<br /><br /><br />All in all no complaints!

				Here is a short review of my experiance with uhrwerk. I ordered some 2C-B he offered me even though non was listed at the time:<br /><br />Contact: A+<br />Very friendly and fast responces. Couldn&#039;t ask for more.<br /><br />Shipping: B<br />My order was processed and shipped very swiftly. Stealth was good enough for domestic shipping since the letter looked unsuspicious from the outside, but I hope it&#039;s better for international orders.<br /><br />Product: A+<br />First I should mention that I have no prior experience with 2C-B, I&#039;ve only tried 2C-E before. Anyways, the trip was very pleasant. I split 35 mg with my brother and after the first effects started to become apparent (about T+20 I&#039;d say) we went for a walk into the woods. We initally only planned to make it a short walk, but in the end we were about 4 hours out there tripping. It was really fun, not too hard on the mind and very nice visuals. So without any chemical testing, I&#039;d say this is a very pure product. The price was very good too.<br /><br />Verdict: My new go-to vendor for everything psychedelic on the road. Great service overall. Thanks uhrwerk!&nbsp; :)

				Review LSD:<br /><br />I gave a friend with 0 tolerance 2 drops from Uhrwerk&#039;s LSD. It was mindblastin for my friend. He was near on a ego loss and had heavy visuals. I had a 2 weekend tolerance about 30-40% and had a great trip on 2 drops. We felt the music, the nature&nbsp; and a inner bliss! One of the best experience i&#039;ve ever had with LSD.<br />This is quality Acid....in my opinion it&#039;s a bit better dosed than JOR&#039;s TOC. Very clean feeling and potency absolutely as advertised (TOC a little under).<br /><br /><br />Review DMT:<br /><br />40mg gave me a heavy experience near the breakthrough. Mindblastin stuff too!<br /><br /><br />Uhrwerk got a new returning costumer. A+++ Service!!

				@brokeallstars;<br />sorry about the meth, I tried to save as much preorders as possible but that were the ones over on the main page. I have a producer for pills, and have pressed 250mg Methylone pills for the local domestic market, I am not aiming to produce pills for international shipping. EU is still ok but not extraEU shipping. I think I will let the next batch be orpduced within this month as request is rising again. As there is too little 2C-B available, I cant offer you this, 2C-E or 2C-C is no problem though. The remaining &lt;1kg of Mephedrone is not enough to produce a batch. Will think about that though. Also, 4MEC&amp;PV combination has been requested. Will think about that, too. Am eager to hear further combination recommendations.<br /><br />@xda:<br />did you order that already? I remember being asked if I could produce some 5MeOAMT blotter. Was that you ?<br /><br /><br />@all:<br />Thank you all for your satisfaction, if something is not to your liking, please let me know so I can improve the service.<br />Two users claimed their domestic shipments didnt show up from last week, although bulkier material arrived innerEU that was shipped on the very same day and dropped in the very same mailbox as the material that alledgedly didnt arrive.<br />would like to know what other vendors do in this case ? I have explicitly written in my GENERAL section that I do not give refunds on untracked shipments.<br />I know my approach is rather radical to not refund anything but my only other choice is to not accept users with less than a certain requirement, that have yet to be decided.<br /><br />Am offering PDE-5 inhibitors now, Vardenafil, Tadalafil and also the PE treatment drug Dapoxetine due to local requests. This material is prone to being pressed soon but pills only EU shipping available.<br />

You don&#039;t have to say no to new customers, just make it clear that you cannot offer them refunds.<br /><br />Make it so that the refund does not go over the obtaining expenditures of the chemical, so that the profit for you is at least +-0. I am sure no one wants you to go bankrupt.<br /><br />You could make some calculations on how many shipments have gone lost so far (allegedly) and see if that number goes up when you start offering partly refunds. That way you can get a light picture that if the complications increase, there must be people trying to scam you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for my 4-AcO-DMT and DMT to arrive&nbsp; :P<br />

				Jesusofrave refund policies:<br /><br />► NO REFUNDS FOR: Scandinavia, Denmark, Estonia, Russia and Ukraine. Sorry guys, you have the strictest customs in the world. So you accept all liability by ordering. You can wait till it arrives before finalizing - BUT if it doesn&#039;t arrive, then you will be required to release funds.<br />► NO REFUNDS FOR accounts that are less than 2 months old, or with less than 300 USD (possibly higher) spent. <br />► If you claim your product does not arrive, you qualify for a one time only refund of 30% maximum.<br />► Long standing clients will receive higher refund rates in case of non-arrival. -&gt; up to 70% would be very nice without tracking<br />► We will never resend product in the case of non-arrival. -&gt; maybe you should never send to this adress anymore, because it&#039;s possibly caught by the costums.<br /><br />Sounds like a good refund policie in my opinion, but i have to say this guy is trustworthy. my bulkier order get through without tracking. For me as costumer with flawless stats it&#039;s hard to read that i have to give up a bit security for refund. In the case costums caught my package, all the money is gone, no product and maybe a lot of trouble where i have to pay a lawyer...is this fair? And if package caught by costums (or some postal assholes fucked up the shipment). it&#039;s not buyers fault, it would be more vendors fault and it shows he have to improve package.<br /><br />I would appreciate if you have a better refund policy maybe just in case by case basis without giving up security for your costumers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				- thanks for the ideas concerning the refund update!&nbsp; will make my mind up on the weekend and change the policy then.<br /><br />- there are some areas in Germany that have an extensive delay on postal shipments. there are 3 orders with a latency of almost 5 working days. I can not do anything about it, this apparently is dependend on your local postal departments, orders are shipped every day except for announced non-shipping-days.<br /><br />- There is a little amount of Prominal and Phenyldimethylpyrazolon. In case someone is interested, it is too little material to insert as a separate listing. will set up a custom order for you then.

				@sickroadleaks;<br />why so sad?<br /><br />@HollywoodHank;<br />unfortunately, the hash and methadone are gone. hash will most likely be offered again, my contact for good material is only around here in the winter. <br />methadone was a one-time offer and I have no constant source for it, so it will likely not be offered again.<br />I never even got to offer amphetamine in public because there is a lot sellers on the road for that very product. Will offer some pure phosphate or sulphate salt of amph later this year as there seems to be a demand for it. <br />Sorry I don&#039;t have any better news for you

				I&nbsp; became a fan of yours on SR, when you&#039;ll sell hash again, I&#039;ll be there :)<br />I just read most of this thread, and I have to say: You&#039;re by far the nicest dealer I know, whether offline or online! I&#039;ll make sure, you&#039;ll get a good amount of my BTCs soon :)<br />Another question:<br />Is it possible for you to produce an AM-2201-smoking blend (just like your JWH122-blend)? I would do it by my own, but I have two left hands when it comes to chemical stuff. I&#039;d need 2 grams of a mix with 10% potency or something like that. Off course I don&#039;t want you to have extra work just because of me, but if it doesn&#039;t bother you, this would be awesome. Off course I would pay more than just for the pure material. <br /><br />-Greetings :)

				@LMB:<br />thanks for the feedback. imho, 300mcg is a bit high but I will produce a batch of 180-250mcg blotter, that will go online soon as the spongebobs are emptying fast.<br /><br />@Intrglacticplanetory :<br />how do you mean? It is a essential ingredient in ayahuasa rituals for centuries and as a pure substance, can be used to prevent harm in comparison to the instable content of it in datura leafs.<br />If you allude to the the fact it might be used to harm others, I have faith in humanity, and IF someone wants to harm someone, please ask you local bartender how they can sleep at night as alcohol will most likely be responsible for the death and rape of mre people than you have ever seen in your entire life so far.<br /><br />@adams85:<br />its got a slower and way more subtle onset than ketamine but hits you really hard once you a past the threashold. I get it you start slow with the material ? Have a lot of mates who swear on hitting 15-30mg every 15-20mins with ket, you cant do that with MXE as the halflife is much longer.<br /><br />@pacman85:<br />thanks, am here to improve my service.<br /><br />@all:<br />needed to add NO refunds to packstations and PO boxes, these are the packages mostly looked after by customs and if you dont find a suitable dropoff somewhere else it is dangerous for both parties.

				I&#039;m here to review the Chloral Hydrate (I&#039;ll simply refer to it as &quot;chloral&quot; in the next paragraphs) that uhrwerk let me try. In short : It&#039;s an amazing downer.<br /><br />Chloral was in the form of transparent crushed crystals that are unusually dense, they seem almost oily. It really stinks in my opinion, like vomit mixed with bleach, and I would recommend to not put it directly into contact with mucous membranes because it&#039;s pretty irritating from my experience, dilute solutions are okay to drink but more concentrated ones sting the throat.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />First trial:<br /><br />On my first trial I took 0.25g, to be on the safe side in case it really knocked you down like it&#039;s supposed to, and to test for possible allergic or adverse reactions. I dissolved it in a big glass and the taste was bearable, it tasted like chlorinated water except stronger. It wasn&#039;t irritating at that concentration. I noticed some small effects after 20 minutes that didn&#039;t get stronger over the course of the night, it got me a little more relaxed and sleepy but that was it. I fell asleep a little faster than usual and seemed to get a more restful sleep.<br />The next day, I noticed some not unpleaseant lingering effects that fully went away at about 4PM. I noticed a reduction in anxiety and just feeling more relaxed and mellow overall (nothing really strong). Kind of like after GHB or benzos except better IMO.<br /><br /><br /><br />second trial:<br /><br />I took 1.09g at first this time. I dissolved it in a big glass but it tasted really horrible at this concentration and it irritated my throat, I had to constantly chase each sip with big amount of water to avoid that. I got nauseous during drinking it because of the taste and it took me 10 minutes and a liter of water to finish it.<br />By the time I finished drinking it, 10 minutes later, I was already starting to feel it kick in. The onset is rather pleasant. 20 minutes after that I start feeling some euphora, more so than with GHB, benzos or alcohol. It feels similar to GHB and alcohol but a lot cleaner, there aren&#039;t the&quot;spins&quot; like with GHB or alcohol, no headache, no out of focus eyes and such things. It&#039;s also more sleepy and relaxed than these two. I feel like sleep would be very easy at this point but I don&#039;t feel like I need to sleep, unlike with benzos.<br /><br />An hour and a half after my first dose I take an extra 0.88g, going to a total dose of 1.97g. I parachute it this time because I really don&#039;t want to drink something as nasty again. <br /><br />After 20 minutes I feel really good, the onset is definitely faster and feels a lot better than the first dose that I took over the course of 10 minutes. I feel a buzzing sensation in my head and a huge amount of relaxation and disinhibition. I feel fairly uncoordinated too. The euphoria is as strong as strong as that given by opiates and definitely stronger than that of fentanyl (which isn&#039;t very euphoric), I&#039;d say it feels as good as a nice dose of hydrocodone. What I like about it is that I&#039;m still able to think straight, just slower than usual, unlike with other downers. <br />Colors are brighter and I&#039;m seriously fucked up 40 minutes after my last dose, my inhibitions are non-existant, even more so than with alcohol but I don&#039;t feel the need to do stupid things and the sedation also helps in not making me that kind of stuff. I slept really well that night and the after weren&#039;t unpleasant and not too strong either, there was still some reduction of inhibitions and relaxation. The grogginess was easily fixed by some coffee (it was still better than GHB&#039;s after effects).<br /><br /><br /><br />All in all, chloral hydrate is a very nice drug and is the best downer I&#039;ve had so far, it feels pretty simillar to SOMA (carisoprodol), except there&#039;s a bigger euphoria and the euphoria of chloral alone is almost as high as the awesome SOMA+hydrocodone combo. Taking more than I did could be even better, and I&#039;m sure that chloral would be an even nicer opiate potentiator than SOMA. It doesn&#039;t cloud your mind like benzos or alcohol and doesn&#039;t give you annoying side effects like dizziness or out of focus eyes that alcohol and GHB gives you, which is how it&#039;s similar to SOMA.<br /><br />Under 1g doesn&#039;t seem really euphoric (for me at least), I took about 0.75g more than a week after that experience and I didn&#039;t experience any significant sedation and only a small mood lift, a benzo would&#039;ve been nicer than this dose of chloral. I don&#039;t think tolerance would&#039;ve been so strong for so long, it probably has an exponential dose-reponse curve, much like GHB.<br />The only negative negative effects I&#039;ve encountered was that my breath smelled lightly of chlorine after 2g but I was really feeling too good to care. It&#039;s definitely got some addictive potential to it as well, the day after those 2g I really wanted to take some again but that feeling only lasted for the day after.<br /><br />Forget all about benzos, GHB and alcohol and try some chloral!

				@uhrwerk<br /><br />I recently purcased some liquid lsd and as the package arrived, there was a noticeable smell of alcohol. I would suggest not to use this kind of plastic bottles for shipping. I would also like to ask, whats the original weight of the bottle was (in mg), so I can check if the alcohol just slowly evaporates through the plastic or if the sealing let some liquid out. <br /><br />I am back home on saturday and will give the actual weight of the bottle then. After a short look before it went into the freezer it looked like the filling level was about 4 mm or so. I don&#039;t know how much 25 drops are.

				@wwizard <br />thanks for the review!<br /><br />@Zoohara<br />There is 30drops in the 25bottle and 105drops in the 100drop bottle. I doubt it will evaporate through the plastic but will give you a reading of the bottles once I return. Will take until Monday/Tuesday when I can give you numbers. As there is a manufacturing variance, you will not have the exact number for the weight of each and every bottle. I will provide you with enough numbers so you can calculate. icedrops bottles have been used for as long as I remember to have encountered liquid. I do not like to empty, clean and refill a used bottle as it will most likely harm the dropper and thereby counter the calculation for it.

				@all:<br />-back to regular mode, have answered all mail.<br />-Some user rated the methylone 1/5. I have three batches here right now. Big crystals, white powder and the currently selling remains of the preban times, small crystals. my favorite. I only sell the 99.8%+ material, it is surely the best methylone on the road. I have handled so much M1 batches during the last 8 years that I know what I am talking about.&nbsp; dude says he ate 500mg together with another person and both didn&#039;t feel anything.&nbsp; if ANYONE can eat 500mg without preliminary suffering almost complete serotonin depletion and still tell me your name half an hour after ingestion you get the next 1g for immediate redosing for free.

I&#039;ve had plenty of methylone, and I&#039;ve shared it with plenty of people, and I&#039;ve never seen anyone have a problem with 250-300mg. Certainly never seen anyone fall unconscious from methylone, even on doses exceeding 300mg. I do think it&#039;s very strange for someone to report that they didn&#039;t feel anything off of 500mg though. That sounds even more far fetched.

				Hello, I thought I might as well comment on uhrwerk&#039;s 4-AcO-DMT as I tried it out a few days ago (took 15mg). Shipping was 3 days EU to EU btw.<br /><br />However before I begin I would like to say the one negative thing about this transaction that I only found out after opening the vac seal. <br />The total weight of the product when completely scraped off from the moisture barrier bag (yes I did get everything out of the seams also) with a razor blade was around 15mg short from the 100mg advertised weight. I weighed it out a few times to make sure I got the correct reading on my scale (which I always calibrate before use, it&#039;s an high precision laboratory scale which I bought used but got new calibration weights at the time. I have my trust in the scale, it cost me 300 euros USED). There is no way I lost 15 mg of product, I did the operation on top of a black a4 paper to see any residue that might have fallen, non did. 15mg loss for such an high purity/quality product is a miniscule mishap for me though. I am not feeling bad about it at all, but i thought that i might as well mention about it. The n,n-dimethyltryptamine I got the same time is still unweighed and sealed in original packaging (which is perfect for these small orders by the way).<br /><br />Anyways, to get to the product quality review itself. I know that wrongly stored 4-AcO-DMT fumarate may degrade over time if it get&#039;s in touch with oxygen and water vapor. Therefore the best way to store it is to seal it into an airtight bag/container and in a freezer. Degraded 4-Aco-DMT will slowly start to switch color from pure white to brownish. I received the product as pure white, which gave me the impression there was little to none product degradement, my later experience confirmed this. <br /><br />I administered a dose of 15 milligrams. The comeup was sooooo slow I first doubted I had taken enough to feel anything. I knew I had taken enough when I started to feel this tingly sensations all over my body around 60 minutes later. I went and opened the TV and began to watch Dr. Phil, yes Dr. -fucking-Phil while tripping on 4-AcO-DMT. Slowly the faces of the people on the show started to morph and I began to see these &quot;shades&quot; or darkened spots on the peoples&#039; faces I get when tripping on almost any psychedelic. The bodyload was the worst at around 90 minutes. I really didn&#039;t feel like moving off the sofa. At +120 minutes I felt like I needed some fresh air. So I went out and took my dogs with me for a walk into the forest (there&#039;s forest almost everywhere where I live). It was a beautiful summer day with some magnificent looking, big, fat clouds in the sky, through which the sun was shining. The nature looked so vibrant, almost like some of those stupid filter pictures taken with that some smartphone app (can&#039;t remember it&#039;s name). The sky looked awesome. I&#039;d guesstimate I was around 2 hours in the forest just walking around some longer paths I take less often. I loved being alone. During the walk the effects really didn&#039;t get anymore intense, but I gradually started to feel almost like on a small dose of MDMA from the perspective of how my body usually feels on MDMA. I felt veeeery light, felt good etc. <br /><br />I came back inside and took a bath. It obviously felt amazing. I was starting to feel the visual effect slowly getting less noticeable and my thought process felt like it was coming back to the &quot;normal&quot;. I took some food and began to watch a movie, during which I felt like I came back completely to normal.<br /><br /><br />The complete duration with 15 mg oral administration was 5 hours I&#039;d say? Changes in the visual perception were noticeable for maybe 3,5 hours?<br />All in all, a very delightful experience even with such a small dose. No ego death or anything like that obviously, but I had a really nice afternoon with this compound. And the experience was very easygoing. <br /><br />Product quality is as good as it gets. 5*<br /><br /><br />For any typos I must apologize, this keyboard is acting really strangely. It&#039;s sometimes posting just random gibberish or letter when typing. I might press &quot;h&quot; and it might print &quot;e&quot; on the screen. <br /><br /><br />EDIT: Also to point out that 4-AcO-DMT acted on me as an &quot;hyper-diuretic&quot;, I&nbsp; was peeing around the forest like every 5 minutes :D. So please, if you take it, remember to drink at least 0,5 liters of liquids per hour to stay properly hydrated. However, do not overdrink.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				@Zoohara;<br />very sorry to get back to you now and not before, I didn&#039;t make it before because of the time constraints.<br />I have noted the reading of some filled 25drops- bottles; 3,4474g 3,3339g 3,3618g 3,3751g 3,2841g 3,2712g . Please note that due the manufacturing swings of the standalone bottles without the other two parts (dropper and cap) that the whole (still empty) bottle consist of are very different which I have noted when I filled them with a different product, all three part together make the reading impossible to reproduce. But the bottle you weighted is well within the limits of the ones being weighted today that were not yet went through the postal system. my guess still lays on the presses in the postal sorting facilities that push out some of the gas phase of the bottle. As I said, there should be at least 2-5 more drops in so you shouldnt be tooo worried you got less than you paid for.<br /><br />@miliday:<br />sure thing not everyone falls unconscious but even for a heavy user, 500mg is a dose to struggle with. I bet even a few hard heads will have a hard time to control it.<br /><br />@mrmdma: I appreciate your feedback very much. What I can not explain is what went wrong with your weighting so I call EVERYBODY who received an order from me to please report back the weight you received if your scale allows for a correct reading. I have not the slightest intention for the weight an item low and I can tell you the sartorius scale I possess has cost my former employee 2500-3000 EU, it is calibrated each and every time I use it. This should not be about dick sizing but I have to tell you that because this is tools is an industry standard for analytical labs. I have the complete range of standards here, beginning from 1mg and will run that before I got on vacation.<br />I have the drive to give more material to everybody who orders from me. When I weight the 100mg baggies, I never stop at 105mg but do so at 110mg up to 125mg, which is the threshold for me to put some back. When the bags get sealed, they get flattened out before in which case sometimes a little material dusts out of the bag. I keep that to a minimum and because I always weight heavy, I don&#039;t care for that amount. You are very welcome to claim your difference in weight with an eventual successive order. Also, the 4AcO DMT is VERY dense compared to other material and thus it might be that the difference is not in electronics but stuck to the wall. the dust might weight a lot. Have your turned around the bag and scrapped it with a plastic card? I suppose that is the single most effective way the get everything out. Reading your post makes me sure I might have made a mistake with a little material that went out the bag. I will empty two bags before my next vacation and give you the reading for it, too.<br /><br />@Raglak:<br />thanks for your opinion, I second that :D

The only thing I can think of to explain this is that either my scale is giving out false readings randomly (which I doubt) or that the mismeasurement was caused my miniscule roughness of the wooden table I was doing the weighing before.<br /><br /><br />I know that sartorius is a well established brand name in the &quot;scale industry&quot;, most scales at my University are sartorius.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				@mrmdma;<br />this might seem like a strange question considering you were very elaborate about the procedure- but you know how to correctly weight a product? <br />After making sure the libelle (the drop of air in oil) is correctly adjusted and you calibrated your scale you need a container you weight three times with in-between removals. note the weight of the container (a piece of paper) every time. <br />you need to remove the container for the transfer of product onto/into the container because bad scales will try to tare the weight up to a certain threshold. note the weight of the container plus product and subtract it to get the proper weight. Also, if your scale does not provide a cage around the weighting part your should really make sure to not move too fast due to air influence. If I weight with only the fourth digit, even with a closed cage, I have to make sure to not balance my weight from one leg to another because even that makes the reading take ages to settle. I don&#039;t use the fifth digit anymore as it needs a frickin long time for to settle down.<br /><br />I have not yet opened the packages. Will do so anyway to see how much I get out of the package.

				@all;<br />got no idea how to cope with the amount of mail I receive every day. I will most likely start to answer very briefly or ignore the questions that can be answered by reading my vendor page. I do my best to ship orders out every day but it is very tedious to read through so much mail and answer it as complete as I wish.&nbsp; Will need to cut back on the time I dedicate to that.<br /><br />@I am so wet;<br />just prepared a fresh batch of liquid. the dosage is now at 125µg, would I have known before you wish double the dosage, I would have prepared some with double dosage. Now its too late. I guess the price is better the way I prepared them as the stays the same, which it wouldn&#039;t have, had I doubled the dosage.<br />These listings presents the last remains I have left of this crystal. there will be 15x 105drop bottles and some 25drop ones. I wanted to offer different blotters already but have failed to find my camera so far. They will be online after the weekend.

				i am fairly sure what that ghost (that might be buying lsd off some relatet uhrwerk in a different dimension) was talking about higher quality acid, not more µg per drop. 2 or 4 drops per trip ain&#039;t really matter. correct me if i am wrong.

				uhrwerk, would you be able to source 2-DPMP (2-diphenylmethylpiperidine)? I&#039;ve read great things about it being a much greater study aid on low doses compared to dexamphetamine or other licensed ADD/ADHD -prescription medication. It&#039;s also relatively cheap, but I would be willing to pay a good price for being able to buy it from you!

				Ordered 2 gramms of Methylone from the new batch.

				His 2C-P is _really_ good. Nice high, no body pain/weirdness, no hangover the next day.<br /><br /><br />Dosing also can be done very accurately via solving it in distilled water. <br /><br />Example:<br />Put 100 mg in 50 ml water in a dropper bottle.<br />Shake it well, 2P-C, from what I hear is stable. Make sure it is completely solved (!).<br />[--&gt;20 Drops equal apprx. 1 ml]<br />So in this example 10 drops equal 1 mg of 2C-P.<br /><br />dropper bottles are about 2 bucks in your local pharmacy. mumble sth. about natural health flower essence, if you feel weird buying that stuff.

				Hey Mito, how&#039;s it going?<br /><br />Just received (and finalized) some of Uhrwerk&#039;s mxe before the Cataclysm. It&#039;s excellent, and is/was a welcome addition to the slim selection on offer elsewhere. Globalshipping was also good too.<br /><br />Hope he didn&#039;t lose too much cash, he&#039;s a superb vendor.<br />

				US based customer here who received an order recently (i used GPG encryption), unfortunately SR was busted and unfortunately was unable to finalize as a result :( but figured id post this at least to bolster his rep if he decides to sell on BMR and/or sheep<br /><br />Ordered MDPV, arrived quick, very stealthy, good quality.<br /><br />My last SR purchase, made a week before SR was busted :( Arrived on the same day SR was shutdown. hope you set up somewhere else uhrwerk !<br /><br />just wanted to indicate due to paranoia that orders made are still arriving despite SR being infiltrated by LE since July 23. this order was a week or so ago. No evidence of tampering with envelope etc to indicate if customs messed with it or not (they didnt)

				Worried. urhwerk is a pro. I really really really hope he&#039;s Okay. Uhrwerk, if you see this hit me up toroorto@Safe-mail.net<br />FYI, I DID receive what i had ordered last week. More than happy to get him his bitcoins. I had a feeling I should have FE&#039;d, but we all got fucked. I&#039;d like to make it right. Why do we allow the government to interfere with our own personal choices? There is absolutely NO CONSTITUTIONAL basis for shutting down places like SR. Personally, I abide by the Non Aggression Principle. There is NOTHING immoral or wrong with an individual making their own PERSONAL DECISIONS, as long as the actions are not aggressive towards others and they do not interfere with the personal property, or liberties of any another individual. <br />&quot;Love is the Law. Love under Will.&quot;-Aleiser Crowley<br />Jesus Christ himself taught ONLY ONE LAW. Love thy neighbor as thyself. The government was <br />shut down&quot;. They could have killed SR at ANY point in time before now. They merely STOLE money from hard working people because of their mistakes. I&#039;m likely preaching to the choir, but I want everyone here not to worry about &quot;getting busted&quot; but concern yourself with the real possibility that the entire world economy is on the verge of collapse. I love everyone. Even the People responsible for this blatant thievery. I do this because LOVE will be the ONLY thing that can save us from ourselves. Hatred, fear, and greed are the antithesis of individual freedom.&nbsp; Love is the true identity behind individual liberty. THis is a difficult concept for many to grasp at first.&nbsp; DEA agents reading this, please ask yourself if you&#039;re really helping. You are not. You are creating more hatred and negativity. FREEDOM! &quot;. &quot;I would much rather suffer the inconveniences attending too much freedom than those attending too little.&quot;- Thomas Jefferson
