				WalkaBoot<br />⚔ ⚔ ⚔ ⚔ SPEED EU - FR ⚔ ⚔ ⚔ ⚔⚔ ⚔ ⚔WEEKEND OFFER<br />5g SPEED IS WET &amp; STRONG ! (3.37g dry)<br />WHITE POLISH SPEED NEW BATCH 70-74%<br />ships from: undeclared<br /><br /><br />Quality (1/5)<br />Street speed is probably twice as good as this batch.<br />Mostly the caffeine mixed into it will give you a fast heartbeat, but that is it. Had to take more than 500mg, to get some effect (beside the caffeine effects), but no euphoria. After a couple of hours I got very sleepy, had to take another 300mg to wake up again..<br />I do not have a high tolerance, I had no speed for a long time.<br />I hate low quality speed, as you have to snort such a huge amount to fell anything. My nose is running like shit now.<br /><br />The &quot;paste&quot; had a very light Amphetamine smell, took some time to dry (5.22g wet --&gt;&nbsp; 3.37g dry), so I guess we are looking at 5% - 10% Amphetamine not the stated 70-74%, because I had to take more than 500mg to get some effect.<br />But I guess, he is not lying, saying: &quot;70-74% polish speed&quot; might be true, but the polish speed itself has only 5% - 10% Amphetamine...<br /><br /><br />Quantity (5/5)<br />5g wet Speed, received 5.22g = 3.37g dry<br />Although you only receive only 3.37 dry speed, ordering 5g wet speed, you know in advance, that it will be less after drying.<br />But I still do not get it, why they all claim, that their wet product is &quot;speed paste&quot;..<br /><br /><br />Price (5/5)<br />Weekend offer was pretty cheap. Around 10USD / gram (dry).<br /><br /><br />Shipment (3/5)<br />Within EU 7 days. Ok, but I prefer speedier speed.. (other deliveries from SR i.e. take 2 days..)<br />Had to sign for letter.<br />He states: PRIORITY TRACK AND TRACE - ORDER, but I received no Track and trace number or any e-mail.<br /><br /><br />Packaging (3/5)<br />No stealth at all, but multiple smell-tight vacuum was good!<br /><br /><br />Total: 3.4<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />There is way better speed on Silkroad, there is better Speed around the corner on the street, and although it was cheap, still too expensive for that bad quality.<br />Going back to my favorite SR Speed seller

				Walkaboot&nbsp; :D<br /><br />A mistake to order from this Vendor. He get from me 4/5. Yesterday I write to him that it is the baddest Speed which I ever get on SR and in the second mail that he get his 5/5 but only because he has 100%. Today there are no 100% so he get his rating and for this bad product it is a really good and fair rating. I really wondering why there are no other people who dislike his bad product. Sorry, but if anyone say this product is good then because he get another product then I get or he try the first time amp. His 70% offer is simply a lie and he know this. For all other which want to try Walkaboot 5g 70%. Go and buy 1g of good stuff (speed treat will help) and mix it with 4g caffeine and milk-powder. Did I forgot anything in my mixture? :D
