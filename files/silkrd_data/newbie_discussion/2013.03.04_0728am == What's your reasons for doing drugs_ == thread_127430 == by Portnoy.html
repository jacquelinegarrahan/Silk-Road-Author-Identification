				Hey all I&#039;m just curious as to why you guys are doing drugs.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s probably a reason or an excuse other than just having fun, share your stories brothers.

				Thanks Portnoy. I appreciate the support. I agree that this is true of a lot on here. I&#039;ve been prescribed and tried many things; nothing works or has as few side effects as weed.

				At first it was curiosity, I&#039;d love to take a wild &#039;journey&#039; with 2C-B, LSD or a good K-Hole (my favorite drug by far).<br />Now however, I use ~50-100mg Oxycodone, 100mg MST and 2-5 C10s a day... this is called an addiction and I hate myself for it. <br /><br />Fun though....

				The plain and simple reason?&nbsp; Because drugs are interesting as fuck and I love exploring/opening my mind and feeling awesome.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently in my last semester of my undergrad microbiology degree.&nbsp; I love science, and I know most people don&#039;t see it this way, but everything about drugs is science.&nbsp; The effects they have, the mechanisms they work by, etc etc.&nbsp; I study and research the fuck out of every drug I partake in.&nbsp; I know their chemical properties, structures, the receptors and systems they work on in our bodies.&nbsp; <br /><br />And of course, as any good scientist should do, I experiment.&nbsp; I take my researched knowledge, and add to it with my own experience.&nbsp; One day I may grow out of doing drugs.&nbsp; But, for now, I&#039;m young and I&#039;m gonna play.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				What&#039;s your reasons for not doing drugs? <br />I do drugs to kind of look at things from a different perspective, basically mind expansion. Also to feel all the amazing feelings a human body can and think about everything from shoe laces to the whole universe, just by ingesting a substance first hand.

				&lt;ironyLite&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;li&gt; They are so uniquely different in their effects, letting you experiment with emotions, physical conditions and psychic spheres, that a *normal* person will simply miss.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;li&gt; Then, on the long way to addiction, you will gain knowledge, *normal* persons also missed. I.e. how to cure the THC hangover by overdosing Speed the morning&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;after, just to take some sleeping medication in the evening. Probably then you know how to deal with Xanax aftermath already.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;li&gt; Finally - very very proud about - having reached the final destination of being a street bummin&#039; junkie sucking c*xx for dope, you will experience <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;how nice life can actually be, when you have only few things to care about. That would be drugs + money. &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ironyLite&gt;<br /><br /><br />well, let&#039;s get serious ;)<br /><br /><br />Traveling the road to adolescence, I discovered that there is much more than just drinking the hell out of my brain. It began with some little smoking and I stuck to weed for some years. <br /><br />In the meantime close friends became heavy smokers like me, or I eventually eliminated social bonds to other friends not so fond of drugs or finding any pleasure in the relaxing high. <br />Well, of course it was only a matter of time, until the first chemical drug was at the same party as me... Similar to the WOW-effect after trying my first joint, I got another... and another... and another.... It became my passion to collect experiences, like football cards.<br /><br />No some time has past (over 10 years) and I know pretty much about those &#039;regular&#039; substance and many RC, too. <br />Honestly, I don&#039;t want to quit, because the only alternatives would either being sober or just drinking from time to time. <br />The sober thingy never worked for me, that&#039;s that. And the relaxing beer in the evening, or the binge-drinking at weekends are not interesting for me any more. <br />Why trying to get laid in the middle of the night somewhere in a place you don&#039;t know, also in a condition of &#039;go-home-your-drunk&#039;, when instead I could have a nice cerebral-uplifting talk with my close friends or maybe experience some of the other dimensions surrounding us. <br /><br />Summing up, after some years of drugging I still did not lose the passion for experimenting. Finding new ways and combinations to provide novel experiences still makes me happy and I think a decent drug usage can provide various benefits to body and soul

				Modern pot now makes me paranoid- thanks to 4 foot roofed amsterdam barges and the addition of indica to every fuckin strayne. <br />Pure sativa useda make me wanna work like a buzzball all day and think lots and value figurin it all out. <br />Skunk made me a paranoid recluse who was certain my next breath was the last and killed any enjoyment I had of weed. <br />I don&#039;t like listening to my fuckin breathin and my heart thump coz of thate indica bodystone. <br />I wanna to see the colours of the music in the air of my room like i useda on thai.<br />Can&#039;t get thai no more so I can&#039;t smoke pot. Alcohol fucks my mind and body way too hard. <br />I have chronic pain issues and a dr.who cares far more about people diverting than his patients pain issues which current medical thinking has deduced is &quot;all in your (fucking) head&quot;. Yeah sure, here let me demonstrate that theory on your head doc... <br />Opiates make me forget lost loves. Opiates are my lost loves.<br />Opiates make me nicer to people. Opiates also make me a nasty basterd.<br />Opiates make it easier to put up with the knowledge of the fucking horrible things in this world that you can&#039;t change.<br />Sure it&#039;s weak. I&#039;m weak. They don&#039;t make me strong but they don&#039;t make it harder to deal with the obscene absurdity of the fact a baby still starves to death every 20 seconds like I found out&nbsp; it did when I was a 5 year old and they still will be when I&#039;m 90 and all just so some deluded muthahfuckah can shoot some other deluded muthahfuckah with a weapon that they could have used the money they paid for instead on food to feed those starving kids, and all of this so they can take control of the opium fields and keep the supply in the hands of their own government&#039;s drug supply chain, eg Vietnam- opium, eg Afghanistan-opium.<br />Drugs make me part of the problem while making me feel like there&#039;s no problem at all. They&#039;re custom built for liars. <br />Great question btw.

				I didn&#039;t bother reading the thread although I&#039;m sure its already came up multiple times. For me personally any drug I do take I take for a specific purpose. All drugs are not the same so the question of reasoning for taking drugs in general is perhaps too vague. Perhaps you meant drug of choice? My drug of choice is bud. And I have various reasons for taking it but I can say that those reasons all boil down to happiness.

Who are politicians to tell me I can&#039;t?<br /><br />No peer pressure with me though it was all my own choice. When I was a little kid watching tv, before I first ever took anything, my mum would always say my eyes used to light up if anything came on screen about drugs. I guess I was just destined to like them. Tried weed at 13yrs old and have smoked it almost every day since.

				I started out of fascination with the ability to change my mindset via ingestion of ... things. Nowadays, I use weed on a regular basis for many reasons, am learning what proper dosage of amps is for treating my ADHD, and occasionally &quot;come home&quot;&nbsp; with something out of PHIKAL or TIHKAL. Eeeeevery once in a while I drink some poppy tea for a night of relaxation.<br /><br />I don&#039;t particularly dig alcohol. Go figure.

				i do pills &amp; MDMA caps.. mainly because the feeling of being uncontrollably happy whilst listening to good music with hectic beats like trap &amp; dnb is amazing. nothing better than going out with ur mates off ur face with good music that u can almost feel.
