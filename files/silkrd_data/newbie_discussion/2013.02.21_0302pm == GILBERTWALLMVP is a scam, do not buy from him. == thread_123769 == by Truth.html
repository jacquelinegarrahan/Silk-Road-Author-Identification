				im not condoning his behavior or any scammer. why would you order from this guy and why would you fe?&nbsp; I can understanding FEing with someone that has 300+ transactions.&nbsp; this guy has 46 in 10 months 4.6/month.&nbsp; his prices on adderall are not lower then the rest.&nbsp; What was the reasoning to do this? why wouldnt you order from someone that was more established.&nbsp; All his feedback says he makes everyone FE first.&nbsp; why would you do business with someone like that.&nbsp; the way the escrow system works to my knowledge.&nbsp; you pay, i send.&nbsp; I keep record i sent via tracking number.&nbsp; i have proof it came.&nbsp; you deny it, my proof holds up.&nbsp; why do i need buyers to FE unless im up to something.&nbsp; thats just my opinion maybe im wrong.&nbsp; but i wouldnt send big orders out to people with low feedback either.&nbsp; I just would not of chosen gilbertwallmvp as the guy to get adderall or xan from&nbsp; and if you bought his software bundle you can get it cheaper and more license keys from joining that IT students association(forgot name at moment)

				I got ripped off by that dude aswell. Ordered Adderall, because I saw that his rating was 85% and that he had some good reviews(which I now know can be forged) and said what the hell let me pull the trigger. Well, he asked me to FE because I didn&#039;t have much orders under my belt. To me that was understandable because DoctorDex said the same thing and me and him are cool, he sent me my stuff and life is good with that guy. However, Gilbertwallmvp asked me to FE, I did and waited. NOTHING, so I sent a PM asking when I would I should look forward to receiving the goods. No response, in any case as a nood you either read the forums thoroughly or learn by getting ripped off. I learned by getting ripped off first. So now I know and knowing is half the battle. Oh I did contact SR support about this dude, but seeing as how I FE&#039;d they can&#039;t really do anything for me.
