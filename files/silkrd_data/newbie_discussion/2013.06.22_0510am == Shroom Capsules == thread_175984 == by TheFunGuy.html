				&nbsp;;)<br />If you haven&#039;t tried capsules it really is &quot;THE WAY&quot;. No nasty taste, better disguise, and better dosing. I personally recommend the LEMON TEK which is very easy with capsules. I can take less of a dose, have better visuals for about the length of a movie and still be able to get to sleep without traveling back in time all nights stressing about a &quot;no sleep&quot; work day the day after.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Here is a guide to that tek:<br /><br />1) Pull apart mushroom capsules.<br /><br />2) Dump the powdered shrooms in a glass.<br /><br />3) Cut up 2-3 limes/lemons, squeeze the juice (i just use my hand) into the glass of shrooms.&nbsp; Your goal in this step is to fully submerge the shrooms with lemon juice, so if you need more than 3 limes/lemons, go for it. I recommend cutting the limes/lemons into 4 pieces each, makes it easier to squeeze.&nbsp; Remember, if it a bit of shrooms is sticking out of the juice/isn&#039;t fully submerged, you need more juice.<br /><br />4) Let this concoction sit in the glass for 20 minutes, stir every 5-10 minutes with a spoon.<br /><br />5) Once 20 min is up, drink that stuff down. Your goal here is to drink it as fast as you can without keeping it in your mouth any longer than you have to. <br /><br />6) Trip balls.<br />

				@ CANNA,<br />Are you implying that I am scamming people?&nbsp; &gt;:( Very sad bro. I&#039;m trying to get started up and its sad that you are trying to slow me down. What, may I ask, would be your intentions in doing such a thing. I assure you, the last thing I am wanting to do here is scam anyone. Quite the opposite actually. Like I said I&#039;m just starting up and really aiming to please.

				@ Canna<br />On second thought, Canna, maybe your intentions are not bad either? Is there something I said that would lead you to believe that I am a scammer? Maybe you are just trying to look out for other? That&#039;s cool but if so I would like to know what it is because I really am trying to do fair business. Maybe anyone else reading this thread can tip me in to why Canna would be attacking my character? ::)<br />Thanks for all the help&nbsp;
