				Hey guys really new to this whole site and wow, what an amazingly supportive forum you guys manage to maintain. I&#039;ve been on the odd forum to do with other things and this has got to be one of the most positive, intelligent and supportive communities I&#039;ve come across so I&#039;m honoured to be able to be a very small part of it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading a lot of the recommended reading Newbie threads such as White 0ut&#039;s Guides and the links that are contained in those. And it&#039;s all great information, a bit overwhelming but much appreciated nonetheless. However, some of it can be a bit conflicting and also user-specific. Which brings me to me query: I understand the importance of TOR, PGP, BTC being used..etc.. that is standard process for everyone from what I gather. What I&#039;m confused about is people encrypting their computers, buying secondary computers, using prepaid services, bootable USB&#039;s ..etc.. Linux being used and so fourth. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what each individual&#039;s needs and relationship with SR exactly and this might dictate the level of security and anonymity desired. So my question is: I&#039;m only looking to be a casual buyer. Sr for me represents more or less the only way I can get stuff as street-wise, I can&#039;t seem to find anyone who can help me. So... from your experience, as someone who would probably be making purchases only once every four months maximum if at all that, I&#039;m wondering what your recommended level of security should be.<br /><br />Basically, in a nutshell what are my options? I obviously don&#039;t want to run into any trouble or take shortcuts but buying a secondary computer (I have a laptop I *might* be able to use but last I recall it was terribly slow) unless absolutely necessary wouldn&#039;t be one of my first options.<br /><br />If you could break it down for me into various things I should consider so I can research those, and let me know what I really don&#039;t need to worry about, that would be fantastic. For example- USB or no USB? Secondary computer or not? If my old one isn&#039;t too slow- keep that and work on windows or is Linux preferred? The computer I&#039;m using right now- wipe to get rid of what I have so far on it or don&#039;t worry about it? Any best method you can suggest that would work for someone like me? Worry about using my wireless or learn how to use other people&#039;s? ..etc..<br /><br />Greatly appreciate any and all replies and thanks in advance for the time taken in typing out a reply!

				Easiest way to maintain maximum privacy and security is to download TAILS and burn it to a DVD or USB drive. Its a linux distro designed to run from memory and clears all traces when the media is removed. It comes pre-configured with TOR and a secure browser, etc.&nbsp; You just put in the DVD or USB, restart and boot from it.<br /><br />https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html

				So basically for just personal use which won&#039;t be that often anyways you guys recommend using TAILS with a USB? Sounds good to me, and I would personally rather avoid installing all sorts of encryption stuff onto a computer if I&#039;m not going to need it. I might split the USB into two parts anyways just as a further level of protection in case.<br /><br />I&#039;m slowly learning and I&#039;d like to know what you guys think about buying bitcoins. I&#039;ve read that it&#039;s not a good idea to buy straight from the vendor and put it directly into your SR wallet. I&#039;m curious as to why this is bad and also what other wallets people use in order to &#039;bounce&#039; the bitcoins around.
