				Perhaps it&#039;s a lack of awareness of the Road? The biggest challenge will be to move the scrips to the US/EUR/AUS and getting through customs. You would not be able to request FE and would potentially face some loss (depending on your stealth). I would assume, though I could be wrong, that Pakistani packages would raise a few eyebrows when delivering to &quot;Western&quot; states, especially if you start to move a lot of volume.<br /><br />Just my thoughts<br /><br />-xoxo

				i cannot seem to see any on here, and yes western countrys but i have very many private clients apart from on silk road uk is slightly hard these days but i use TNT all items are declared with this and they fly through usa ems parcel large parcels fly through aswell but i am prepared for some loss on here will take long amassing feedback due to transit times aswell but maybe i will get somewhere on here with some luck

				with ems it takes upto 20 days at worst usually ten is average, but i also use TNT one of the very few pakistan vendors to have this link as most stuff gets stopped outgoing customs here, that takes 3-5 day and deliverd by fedex

				yes true but some may find it hard to belive that from pakistan the current state is very bad ( well mayb not hard to belive) but shipping to europe has become very difficult thus the lack of pakistani items shipping to the usa is much easier with ems but very slow for my liking it has more sucess with larger parcels then the uk once upon a time the uk was the mainland hub for here, i still get sucess there with couriers but the issue being with that they have to declare it all in the paperwork
