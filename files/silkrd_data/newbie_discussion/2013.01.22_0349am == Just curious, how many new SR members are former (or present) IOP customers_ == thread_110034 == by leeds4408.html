				I&#039;m just asking out of sheer curiosity, and to also perhaps assess the myriad pros/cons between ordering from SR versus perhaps their once go-to longtime IOP vendor<br />I myself tried various IOPs over the few years I have been purchasing online as a sole buyer/consumer, before encountering SR out of my fascination and due respect for the relatively sophisticated layers of security, and dedicated members that seek to maintain a strong, accountability-based buyer/seller community, not just any other marketplace.<br /><br />that said, are some of you guys complete converts to SR, or perhaps never even dabbled in IOPs and was always a SR member, or perhaps use a hybrid of both SR vendors and only the most reliable IOPs that you&#039;ve been loyal customers with for a relatively long time? I myself am both a new SR member, and a relatively new member of the IOP marketplace, however from my short experiences from both so far, I have realized that SR is not necessarily the magical &quot;silver bullet&quot;. now don&#039;t get me wrong, reputable SR sellers are amazing (I am speaking on behalf of US residents, and US vendors) with the shipping speed, even outshining those US based OPs that claim overnight shipping at an astronomical fee (my overnight order ended up taking roughly 2 weeks...but didn&#039;t worry too much about it as I thankfully exercised the COD option for that particular order); one last point: I am also beginning to notice that bulk orders are more difficult (and certainly more expensive) than some of the IOPs I am familiar with. Please correct me if I am wrong; furthermore, perhaps bulk purchases are simply not advised in general?<br /><br />Thanks for all your input ahead of time
