				My order disapeard after I finalized, so Im taking the word of the vendor that he shipped it. It was my first order, so I had to FE. I hope I dont get screwed. It would suck to lose $220.

				Once you finalize, the order is gone.&nbsp; There ARE vendors that do not require fe - I have NEVER been asked to fe.&nbsp; I considered voluntarily doing it 1 time with a vendor who is of reputation for free shipping.&nbsp; Then the vendor did/said some things that just flat out did not add up.&nbsp; The vendor canceled the order, thank goodness looking back, but if it requires fe, it is just not worth it to me.&nbsp; One of the things to realize around here, is that vendors come and go, reliable one minute, scamming the next.&nbsp; Beyond that, feedback on sr makes it almost impossible to decipher between reliable vendors and unreliable vendors, so at times, without days and days of research to find the one key post that gives you the real story on the vendor, you dont have a clue how reliable they are.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ordering in smaller quantities will also help avoid being asked to fe.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you did NOT finalize the order, and it is not showing up, it may not have went through.&nbsp; Message the vendor to see if they have the order.

				&nbsp; All&#039;s good. I wasn&#039;t chosing the shipping and updating b4 I sent it..... Got quite the variety&#039;s of goodies coming now!! So excited. And no one asked me to FE, but they were all small orders too.
