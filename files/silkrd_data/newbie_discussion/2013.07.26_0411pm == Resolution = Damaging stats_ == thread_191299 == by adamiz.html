				YES IT FUCKS YOUR STATS IF THE THEY REFUND!&nbsp; I now have vendors who refuse to sell to me because a new vendor had all his packages seized, admitted it was his fault, said not one single customer received their orders and so he agreed to give us all a refund.<br /><br />As a result of that, I&#039;m the one who is now fucked and have vendors refuse to deal with me! Cool eh, don;t you just love SR!!!!

				Yeah its f&#039;ing shit but I wish I&#039;d just lost the cash. It was for over $50 but in the long run it has ended up costing me more than that by not being able to order from the vendors I want. SR need to be able to fix this. If you order a product and think its shit then its your problem to deal the refund issues if you get one. If the vendor admits their problem then it should not show on stats as refund as its not your fault. But next time I will finalize and leave 1/5 write shit feedback and spam the forums instead then the vendors can suffer for the fuck up and not me.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=191299.msg1380300#msg1380300">Quote from: adamiz on July 26, 2013, 05:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well I ordered I free sample of weed 2 weeks ago and it didn&#039;t arrive.<br />Vendor was willing to refund my few btc for the postal but then I said to him I will just finalize in order to keep my stats clean.<br /><br />Don&#039;t want to mess my stats from some sample of weed.<br /><br />Thanks guys for your answers.<br /><br />Adamiz<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
