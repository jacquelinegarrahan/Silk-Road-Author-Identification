				This is my review thread for people who are newbies. If you have exchanged your REloadit packs or Bitcoins with me leave the SR community some feedback on how your transaction went. I would love to hear how you feel about my exchange with you. <br /><br />Here is my other review thread for members with 50 posts: <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=140499.msg961073#msg961073<br /><br /><br />

				I am charging a 3% fee for all REloadit exchanges until May 1st at 12:00AM EST. <br /><br /><br />Get a REloadit pack from your nearest store. Send me the code on the back and you will have your Bitcoins in less than 24 hours after. THAT SIMPLE.<br /><br />Check out my page located in my signature for more information and to place your order.

				CX IS THE MAN@!@!@!!@!@!!@!!@!<br /><br />I have used his ReLoadit to BTC service 4 times now and this is what I have come to expect as standard when dealing with CX:<br /><br />1. Unmatched Quality Customer Service<br /><br />2. Prompt and detailed Communication<br /><br />3. Speedy Coin Delivery, usually within a few hours.<br /><br />4. Fair exchange rates, and the lowest fees around!<br /><br />During my most recent transaction with CX, the road went down, and he still pulled through as soon as he got back on the road. He also messaged me to ask if I still wanted to go through with the transaction.<br /><br />There is not a single more trust worthy BTC vendor on the road, and I say this with complete confidence.<br /><br />This is why CX has a loyal customer in me always.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to use CX&#039;s services!!

				Hi all,<br /><br />Read positive things about CoinXchange on Reddit, and thought this would be a good time to purchase my first Bitcoins.<br /><br />A couple of questions on the process:<br /><br />1) So, what I need to do is purchase a MoneyPak (or similar) with at least $300 on it. The card will have some sort of &quot;code&quot; printed on it. I then send this code to CoinXchange, and shortly after, BitCoins will show up in my SR account -- less any processing fees? Is that all there is to it?<br /><br />2) According to a newbie guide on Reddit, I should be seeing the real $ amount for an item below the BC price. Please see the screen grab at the top of the following page:<br /><br />http://cannabiscorner.net/guide-to-the-silk-road-part-3-making-an-order/<br /><br />For some reason, I&#039;m not seeing the cash info -- only the BC price. Any ideas?<br /><br />thanks in advance!<br /><br />EDIT - Just saw the tutorial, so just need help with item 2 above.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE: Transaction went as smoothly as possible, and have used him since as well. Recommended!

				I&#039;ve been on SR over a year, but don&#039;t post much. Maybe I&#039;m lazy. I definitely think getting btc can blow. Anyone remember when they were around $8? I do. (*sniff*)<br />I&#039;ve been burned by moneypak-to-btc vendors often enough to know better. <br /><br />CoinXChange is fast and gives you the formula used for the conversion. More than fair. There&#039;re a lot of traders out there, but I haven&#039;t seen any with turnaround time or motivation like CoinXchange. Take that SugarMama.<br /><br />Love their service. I&#039;ll be back.

				Posted this in his main review thread; didn&#039;t want to leave the newbies out. ;) <br /><br />Okay, deal is done.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a summary of my experience with CX:<br /><br />Note: replies were really quick. Never more than an hour, usually within a few minutes. Fast talker. :P<br /><br />Exhange with another vendor was 2/3 of the way fulfilled leaving me with 1 vanilla reload pack left and short on coin for an important purchase.<br />Only 3 left. <br />omgwatdo!!<br />Coinxchange!! :D<br />Know his page says 24 hour processing time. <br />A lot of reviews say under an hour-a few hours so,<br />message him to make sure he&#039;s available.<br />Tells me he is, but it will take a couple of hours to process.<br />Tell him that&#039;s exactly what I needed to know, a couple of hours is okay.<br />Place order.<br />&gt;9 hours later message him to get an eta<br />need to stay on top of that order and checking the road every 20 minutes for the past few hours had become tiresome(no, I don&#039;t have SS&#039;s api :P ).<br />He says &quot;a few more hours&quot; and apologizes for taking so long. Nice guy.<br />Message him back, &quot;that&#039;s cool, no big but I need specifics&quot;, even though I understand that it&#039;s just a guess.<br />He messages back: sorry, something came up and can&#039;t process order until 12-2 the next day.<br />Whatevs<br />Shrug my shoulders and go do things.<br />Sleep.<br />Log on around 2pm and my order is processed. Woo-hoo!<br />Took about 21 hours for the order to process fully, so well under the 24 hour mark.<br />Best part: the item is still in stock so I get my goodies. Fuckin eh! :D <br />Vendor was quick to respond, communicative and friendly.<br />Overall, I would do it again<br />but be more specific and more thorough next time if I&#039;m in a hurry.<br /><br />Side note for those who are wondering:&nbsp; Price is pegged to whatever bitcoin is when he processes the order, not when you place the order.&nbsp; Allow for fluctuation.
