				So be patient, and don&#039;t spam. Just make the Newbie section more valuable by posting valuable information.

				I think the more that new users learn this fact, in addition to the fact that long time members also read and post in the Newbie section, the better posts and, consequently, forum communications will become.<br /><br />There is no need to &quot;rush to 50&quot;, because that only wastes valuable public resources. Silk Road Forums is a public resource, in which its users are the contributors--you and me, however anonymous.<br /><br />Good Luck.

				My thinking is who wants to do business with someone with doesn&#039;t of spam posts in the newb section? Post something intelligent and worthwhile and you&#039;ll get some respect.

Be safe, and ask questions. You will always get negative responses, so be patient and keep an open mind. Even positive responses are sometimes loaded with more holes than Swiss cheese. Be careful, and do what makes the most sense.<br /><br />Traffic stop? NEVER SAY ANYTHING THAT CAN BE PROVEN FALSE. When you lie to Johnny Law, then you immediately enter the realm of suspicion. Pay attention to the conversation, and don&#039;t elaborate or go beyond the question(s). Be helpful to the officer, but limit your own exposure. Don&#039;t ask for--or mention the need for--a lawyer unless you are being arrested. It reveals that you are anxious about something that has not been explicitly stated.<br /><br />DUI? Sometimes you have to take a few lumps. If you ever do get charged, then make sure that you don&#039;t carry gear... Friday night... going to a party... Carrying? Carry sober. Party... go home empty handed... DUI? Then it will ONLY be a DUI instead of possession charges, etc....
