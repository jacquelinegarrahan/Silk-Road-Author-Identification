				Be safe on the Internet is not an option. The slightest mistake could be used by a blackmailer undertaking or law enforcement officer to connect your identity Silk Road to your identity online, and then your life will become very complicated very quickly. To this end, there are a number of things you can do to divorce your character Silk Road from your online persona, and it would be a good idea for us all to share a few things. For example, you&#039;ve probably noticed the structure of the sentence in this paragraph is strange - all communication via text or other digital anonymity is important, I use a translation program to translate from English to a another language and back. This eliminates the possibility that someone could link me to secure communications by matching the phrasing I use manners or other texts, because they are all chewed up in the translation. I think it might be a good thread for us all. What tricks do you use to keep your identity a secret?

				You should also avoid basing your user name on the Silk Road on anything that might be related to you - birthdays, food or favorite bands, the places you live or have been to. Even putting a timezone can reveal more information than you think - depending on where you live, your time zone can cover a relatively small area, which with other evidence from your profile or things discussed in the forum of conversation, an intelligent person could reduce your identity down to a profile remarkably accurate. We all want to be friends here and there is nothing wrong with that, but safety must come first. Sometimes a mistake is all it takes. The safer we all as individuals, the safer we all as a community.

				One must assume that any post here is read by law enforcement. Do not say anything on the forum you would not put on a display inside a police station. Be careful when you release the information more personal basis - the person that you say that where you went to college or what city you live close maybe a police officer. Even if they are not, they could be caught by the police and provide all the information they have on so many people they know to try to reduce their sentence. Maintaining absolute anonymity is difficult and tedious, but the gain peace of mind has no price.
