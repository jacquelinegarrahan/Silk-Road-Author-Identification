				Hey SR beauties&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I have an order that I expected to take about 3 weeks to arrive.&nbsp; Tracking said it made it to my country and is slowly making it&#039;s way towards me.&nbsp; I&#039;m convinced it will arrive eventually and I didn&#039;t get ripped off.<br /><br />However, the 17 days since it was marked in transit only has about 3 days left.&nbsp; If I finalize, and it doesn&#039;t show, I can&#039;t undo it.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve also never hit resolve and don&#039;t know what happens if I do.&nbsp; Is there a way to like, buy more time before I have to finalize or ask for a refund? Or should I just FE and update my feedback in two weeks if it doesn&#039;t come? If I did that even though I could shit all over his ratings I wouldn&#039;t be able to get my money back.<br /><br />Any advice would be appreciated!<br /><br />Trellis

				Have you tried messaging the vendor? you would be surprised with how nice some of&nbsp; them actually are.<br /><br />Your package will more than likely arrive though so don&#039;t panic

				Yeah, I mean the tracking is convincing to me, assuming he didn&#039;t ship me a box of used kleenex or whatever. And I&#039;ll probably just finalize on the last day. It&#039;s a small order (~$50) and not something I&#039;m hugely jonesing for so I&#039;m not hugely invested in it emotionally or financially. <br /><br />This might give some context that would explain my uneasiness about finalizing early:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186546.msg1352513#msg1352513

				You can hit the resolve button and request a 7, 10 or 14 day extension, if the vendor agrees. That way you stay in escrow and you allow the package enough time to make its way to you.
