				My first three o/s orders just didn&#039;t show up. As most know customs in Aussie don&#039;t bother writing you a letter to tell you its been confiscated. With all the fucken about trying to get&nbsp; refunds etc I don&#039;t want to take any chances again for now as it gets expensive losing your BTC. With this major hard on the Aussie customs have for SR at the moment it&#039;s a nightmare.<br />My major interests is in opiods, eccies and coke.<br />Any suggestions please?

				Naming the O/S vendors that have success is more likely than not going to mean that they won&#039;t have success for much longer.&nbsp; Personally I think the naming of vendors that do have success should be banned if your going to name countries.&nbsp; Message the vendors and see what they say as to their success rate, don&#039;t FE and be sure they have a refund policy that you agree with.

				suffer for your drugs like the rest of us buddy!<br />Seriously though, if you do your homework and even cop a few no shows, you&#039;ll still end up in front when you consider price and quality.

				They probably got caught up in the recent &quot;customs operation&quot;. Seems that for a month or two there the probability of getting anything through, particularly from certain countries, nosedived.<br /><br />We can only hope that things are back to....ahem...normal now.

				Yeah , I guess naming vendors that are having success getting it thru is kind of like doing the cops jobs for them. Most vendors make it pretty obvious on their profile page how bad their success rate to AU is when they offer no reships and a 25% only refund rate., unfortunately, it seems to be the majority of sellers on here. (Well for the gear i want anyway!)
