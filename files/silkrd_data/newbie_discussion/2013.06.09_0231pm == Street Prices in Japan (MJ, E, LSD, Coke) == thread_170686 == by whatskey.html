				MJ: US$35-$55/gram! That is (assuming premium weed which goes for maybe up to $10-15/gram in the US) up to $US1500/ounce!<br />E: US$30-$40/pill.<br />LSD: US$30$40/hit.<br />Coke (generally very bad quality): $90-$150/gram. US$3000/ounce.<br /><br />All due to the Yakuza controlling most of the drug trade/very strict drug laws. <br />Non-Yakuza people with connections will obviously adopt those prices, why wouldnt they?<br />If one wouldnt go to jail so easily, you could make a killing here. The problem: You can not risk shipping to your own address, because the police do not fuck around and it is not as &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; as in other countries. Last, but not least, the joints here are no joke. It will fuck you up.<br />So, what is the best play here?

				Time again to do some advertisement for my thread Mail Forwarding and Virtual Office Providers - Concept and Thoughts ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143742 )&nbsp; ;)<br />Now Japan has multiple similarities to Australia ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165213.msg1170842#msg1170842 ) but there&#039;s a few key points which makes it different:<br /><br />* Japan has it&#039;s own writing system ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system ) which will draw less attention when used compared to if the western equivalent is used.<br />* According to http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/imports Japan - Main import partners are: China (24 percent of total imports), United States (9 percent), Saudi Arabia (8 percent), Australia (7 percent) and South Korea (5 percent).<br />* The Japanese crime syndicates have largely been integrated into society and are free to handle any agreed activities that have been negotiated with the police. High level syndicate bosses regularly meet with the police equivalent to discuss any abnormalities or changes to these agreements (of which drugs is definitely one of those agreements - they might keep some heavier drugs out as a favor to the police for example).<br />* As mentioned by whatskey if the police find a package with drugs in it you will probably not be able to claim ignorance - the prices are high for reason.<br /><br />The key factor here overall is no individual citizen wants to take the risk of getting caught, so if a package is well packaged or not is kind of taken out of the equation as one can never be really sure. Once the package is inside the system for domestic shipping as far as I&#039;m aware it&#039;s as every other country and the risk is almost non-existant if the packaging is good enough. If one were able to register an account with a fake ID with a Japanese mail forwarder and be able to keep a stockpile the question is still how one would get any japanese customers as they might suspect the vendor would instantly turn over all information to the police (which they probably would). A solution might be if each customer registers their own Mail Forwarder (with fake ID aswell) so it&#039;s essentially a Mail Forwarder sending a package to another Mail Forwarder, then sending it to the final customer (or perhaps some vendor where it&#039;s possible to pick up the package in person). They could technically investigate this too with enough resources but it would be a massive undertaking as it would not be enough to just track the original Mail Forwarder.<br /><br />The crime syndicates would probably have no trouble using this method for getting in bulk amounts as they could lose over 50% of the shipments and still make a big profit with those prices.
