				Just curious if anyone has any tips on getting a good drop address? All the usual suspects require ID - so you might as well use your own address, which leaves friends and relatives houses. Anyone convince relatives to let them use their address? What reason did you come up with why you&#039;re getting stuff sent there?

				I personally use my own hearth as the address. In all honesty If you take all the proper precautions and don&#039;t act a fool on the digital side you have no problem even if you mail is intercepted by LE. But if you don&#039;t it is always going to come back to you no matter where you shipped it... more than likely I should say. Ive learned this from browsing the shipping forum.

				If you can get a fake ID, some places will just keep a photocopy of the ID on hand and not do any sort of checking. That would be crazy safe.<br /><br />Personally I just have a PO box at a small shop far from my house.

				Do not use your home address under any circumstances.<br /><br />Not only do you have to worry about LE but also vendors themselves.<br /><br />How many buyers are going to fight any injustices committed on the part of a vendor if they know they are vulnerable &#039;cos Vendor has their address or relative&#039;s address and fear retaliation.<br /><br />Be upfront with your peeps, they either agree or don&#039;t. <br /><br />

				There&#039;s a guy on SR that sells drop addresses.&nbsp; Good feedback too, but he was in London only. I wish he dealt in other countries also.

				I would have thought most would threaten to do something, or hire people to do something. Living in fear is no way to live.<br />Better safe then sorry.

				wersokd said it best - better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Much easier to not make a mess in the first place than clean it up.

				If you think of it like it&#039;s supposed to appear then there should be no worries. <br /><br />Think of it like you are getting a post office box. Get a big one if you can afford it but most small orders will be folded in half and fit nicely if it comes in a priority envelope<br />Don&#039;t order from overseas so you&#039;ll never have to worry about customs. I&#039;d personally Never use my friends addresses since really all they have to say is that they haven&#039;t seen the package. <br /><br />Most of all. Get your security straight on your end and don&#039;t let anyone (else) know that you buy drugs online. That&#039;s fucking stupid.
