				I want to recommend a way to hide the letter. <br />Recently discovered the postсrossing service on the postcrossing.com<br />Using the PC your Exchange of letters will be less is conspicuous for customs and mail.<br /><br /><br />ABOUT THE PROJECT<br />The goal of this project is to allow people to receive postcards from all over the world, for free. Well, almost free! The main idea is that: if you send a postcard, you will receive one back from a random Postcrosser from somewhere in the world.<br /><br />Why? Because, like the author, there are lots of people who like to receive real mail. <br />The element of surprise of receiving postcards from different places in the world (many of which you probably have never heard of) can turn your mailbox into a box of surprises - and who wouldn&#039;t like that?<br /><br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />First, the short version:<br /><br />request an address from the website<br />mail the postcard to the address<br />wait to receive a postcard<br />register the received postcard in the system<br />The first step is to request to send a postcard. The website will display (and send you an e-mail) with the address of another member and a Postcard ID (e.g.: US-786). You then mail a postcard to that member.<br /><br />The member receives the postcard and registers it using the Postcard ID that is on the postcard. At this point, you are eligible to receive a postcard from another user. You are now in line for the next person that requests to send a postcard. Where the postcard comes from is a surprise!<br /><br />You can have up to 5 postcards traveling at any single time. Every time one of the postcards you send is registered, you can request another address. The number of postcards allowed to travel at any single time goes up the more postcards you send!

				So is the idea that it won&#039;t look suspicious receiving packages from all over the world if you receive postcards from all over the world?

				Yeah, I don&#039;t understand how this would work.&nbsp; It seems like the only way it would would be if you became &quot;pen pals&quot; or whatever with a vendor on here, and good luck trying to explain to a vendor why you need to know their real address.<br /><br />Even if you are just doing it to make it seem like you regularly get mail from random places, postcards are gonna look a lot different from a package with drugs inside it.

				May be adjusted for the fact that it is more used in уeastern Europe.<br />Postkrossing used to increase the incoming mail from Europe, Asia, America, at least in Africa. hence the letters and packages will be less suspicious.<br />Increase the flow of mail in your name)<br /><br /><br />and no need to send in postcards drugs - it is stupid=)

				in this case, use postсrossing getting used to your neighbors\friends\parents\boss\postman the mails from abroad)<br /><br />в таком случае используйте посткроссинг для привыкания ваших соседей\друзей\родителей\начальства\почтальйонов к вашим письмам из-за границы)
