				I&#039;m new to SR. I&#039;m looking to purchase bitcoins rather than going through bitinstant. It seems as though you can no longer use coinapult and i dont trust any of the another sites, as they are not annoynmous.<br /><br />Is it safe to purchase bitcoins via sr? If so, does any of you kind folk have any recomendations on who I could purchase from via history with them? Thank you for your time.

				It depends what country you&#039;re from. I get mine from CaVirtex and it was easy, but I think that is Canadian only. Getting it from SR users I don&#039;t think is as safe as they don&#039;t go through Escrow.

				I&#039;ve used btcmaster several times now and he&#039;s fantastic. You overnight him cash and he has your btc in your acct the minute he gets your cash and you pay no fees other than the $20 for overnight shipping. I think he works with several of the large vendors who need to turn buttloads of btc back into cash. The problem is, he&#039;s so popular it&#039;s kinda hard to catch him when he&#039;s not out of BTC. <br /><br />Admittedly, it&#039;s a little nerve racking sending him cash like that with no escrow, but he&#039;s tried and true and I have friends who have changed upwards of $20,000 with him. <br /><br />Also, the last I checked, his min was $500. It might have gone up because he&#039;s gotten a lot more popular in the last two months or so.
