				I would advise you not to allow your excitement at finding this place cause you to jump in head first without doing a good amount of research on how to keep yourself safe.<br /><br />First, read the wiki (linked from the bottom-right of the main marketplace pages). Many of your newbie questions will be answered there.<br /><br />How you acquire bitcoins will depend on your physical location. Localbitcoins.com is a sound place to start for many people. It hooks you (a private buyer) up with a private seller, and can be a very easy but more importantly, secure, way of getting them.<br /><br />But like I said, don&#039;t get overexcited! You&#039;ve waited this long to get here, another week of proper research won&#039;t hurt will it?!<br />

				There are plenty of &quot;tutorials&quot; here on the forums, you just have to browse about and search a bit. <br /><br />Of course, I would recommend BTCPal or Blue Sky Traders as deposit-method Dark-web sources.&nbsp; But, please please read into how it all works, and truly be safe with what you are doing; and how you are doing it. <br /><br />Educating yourself is very much worth the patience it requires to relax... read... and take it all in.&nbsp; Excitement can work against you here; just as the other poster said.<br /><br />Rule # 4. Take it easy, and you will always get there. The best way to stay on top in the Game.

				<br />Stay AWAY from MtGox.com. They are not a bad place to get a idea of the going rate for bitcoins but do not try to buy from them. Like others have said localbitcoins is a good place to take a look around. They have an escrow system ( I think) and that helps to protect you from scamers. <br /><br />Another piece of advice is that once you are ready to make your first purchase NEVER FE (finalize early) for your product. This is when you buy a product and the vendor wants you to finalize (pay him) before you get your product.<br /><br />The escrow system on SR in designed to help protect both the vendor and the buyer so use it as it is intended and you will have a lesser change of getting scamed. Some vendors will prey on noobies who get wrapped up and just ready to make a deal.<br /><br />Finally, if a deal looks to good to be true or the vendors price is a lot lower then others just don&#039;t do the deal. You will pay more by using a well known vendor but it is worth the investment. If&nbsp; you need anything or have questions PM me and I will try to help.<br /><br />
