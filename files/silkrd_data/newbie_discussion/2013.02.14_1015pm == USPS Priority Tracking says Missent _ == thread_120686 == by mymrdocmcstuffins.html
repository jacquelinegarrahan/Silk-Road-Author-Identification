				I placed an order with a highly rated vendor using my real name and address, it was shipped USPS priority on 02/11/13; vendor provided tracking number.&nbsp; There were no updates until today (not that unusual for USPS), today the status was updated to &quot;out for delivery&quot; to another zip code in my state about 120 miles away, the next status is &quot;Missent&quot;.&nbsp; I have sent the vendor a message, and I am awaiting a reply.&nbsp; Has anyone ever encountered this type of problem? How worried should I be ?&nbsp; <br />

				To me, it just sounds like the post office screwed up.&nbsp; I mean they are government workers and all.<br /><br />I doubt if it was being prepared for a controlled delivery, that they would have updated anything.&nbsp;

				according to a quick google, apparently &#039;missent&#039; means that it was shipped to the wrong post office. whichever post office accidentally got it will be shipping it to the correct one

				A package I sent home from Japan once got missent. Took two extra months for it to arrive. Why? Because they sent it back to Japan FIRST, then reshipped it to my house :S This will probably go smoother, though.

				Glad everything worked for you, thanks for sharing the experience, at least I&#039;ll have an idea of what could be happening if tracking says missent.
