				So, I get comfy with browsing the site, getting to know the venders, etc.<br />I place my first order. I probably made my first mistake by sending them an extra message introducing myself and asking for an extra layer of stealth. I mean, I just let the paranoia get the best of me. Next day - it&#039;s cancelled. Ok, whatever, I&#039;ll try another vender. I go to yet another vender (mind you these guys are the top venders, and multiple posts from first time buyers saying how awesome they are to first timers, etc.) make my second order - figure I probably shouldn&#039;t send a message, but just place the order and be done with it. I figure the chances for my second order getting cancelled by the vender is pretty low. I was wrong. I log back in to see why nothing&#039;s come yet - and it was cancelled a day ago.<br />What the fuck? I&#039;m getting pretty bummed here. I have an account with a pretty pile of BTC stacked up in it - and I&#039;ve been marred from the fucking start. Thoughts? Experiences? Ideas?<br />I&#039;d like to get an order - from a good vender - and build some good relationships.<br />I&#039;m guessing the venders can see cancellations? Or comments from other venders? I mean, am I just fucked? Is this account as good as piss now? What should I do?

				Vendors can&#039;t comment / rate buyers at this point. The only advice I can offer you is to keep trying. You&#039;ve just been extremely unlucky. My first order was successful, and I am in contact with others who have had successful orders. It could be that you&#039;re trying to purchase amounts too large for the vendor to comfortably deal with you having no prior purchasing history. Try dealing with smaller amounts at first, if you have reason to think that is a possibility.

				You may be right. My first order was 1g H and my second was 10 stamps. I guess that might be pushing it? I dunno. I thought that was a pretty low attempt, but I could try for something a bit lower.<br />Should I be comfortable listing the dealers? I don&#039;t want to get them pissed at me. I kinda already feel like I&#039;m walking on thin ice.<br />Do you think it&#039;s safe to list the venders?<br />I really dug their reviews - seem like solid hooks with good product and high ratings in stealth.<br />I mean, I dunno. Is 1g too much for a first purchase?

				Your outcome was what I expected when I was new.<br />I Finalized Early with a vendor who had the product I wanted and allowed newbies if they PMed him.<br /><br />Yeah, you are 0 for 2 BUT you have lost no money, so you are still doing pretty damn good.<br />You will eventually find a dealer, but it may not be the tippy-top dealers since I think they are the ones who get scammed the most and stop catering to newbies.<br />There are many good vendors who aren&#039;t in the top 5%.<br /><br />You just need to spend a bit browsing SR and SRF. A little luck works too. ;)<br />I am guessing heroin is the most scammed product, considering it&#039;s addiction potential.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot, read the ENTIRE vendor page AND order page before making an order. If a vendor sees that you neglected to follow his guidelines AND you have zero stats, you will undoubtedly be cancelled.

				Hey bud i don&#039;t know what you were after but i made 4 orders, 3 with 1 vendor and 1 with another for my first orders and all came through nearly 100%(one mistake was made by a vendor but is being corrected!).&nbsp; On top of that ordered on a sun came on a wednesday.&nbsp; BHO Wax, co2 Oil, Xanax bars.&nbsp; Do alot of research on your vendors, i 100% don&#039;t agree with the guy that says FE, first thing i was told by vets was not to FE on SR.&nbsp; I mean i know some vendors require other despise the idea of finalizing early.Again i do not like this whole FE thing, its a dirty word to me seems the site is designed against it but it is vendors choice... <br /><br />As for first timer ordering,&nbsp; I messaged both my vendors about me being new and some knowledgeable inquiries on the products i was looking to buy.&nbsp; One responded before i ordered the other didn&#039;t but eventually did.<br />Do your research on the forums and mabye you will find like me vendors that are very open to sending to new buyers.&nbsp; And in the one case repeat business and custom orders!!!! I hope to your well schooled in darknet, tor, and pgp.&nbsp; Can really piss off a vendor if you don&#039;t make the process steamline.&nbsp; I always was in communication with seller or people that were via this forum to know if they were in stock and delivering...and if they were cool shipping to a new buyers(not hard to tell).<br /><br />

				Yeah, definitely try to avoid FE.<br />The dealer I chose was the only one selling what I wanted, so I took a chance.<br /><br />Off-topic but I ordered 100mg of pure alprazolam/xanax powder and had questions about the potency so I got 4 grams for free. :D Too bad that vendor went a little psycho and went bye-bye.<br /><br /><br />Recently I have decided that paying for Priority tracking is the best chance of receiving your product. Some vendors are even accused of selectively scamming when you choose First Class.

				I never had any problems with my first purchases, I followed the advice, and thoroughly read the forums, researched the vendors I was interested in. First purchases were a number of the ebooks, which are very cheap, and interesting (although I know you can get many for free on the normal web). This enables you to build up your stats and get 10 purchases under your belt (then, technically, you don&#039;t have to FE).<br />Next step, is to just send a polite message to the vendor, asking if you are OK to score from him. This just shows the vendor that you are polite and &quot;together&quot; enough to not &quot;fuck up&quot;!<br />I started with domestic purchases, I made one, later, to Canada, from the UK. The tension and anticipation and worrying, made the experience so unpleasant, that it put me off for a long time; though I&#039;m glad to say, that as time passes, you tend to get more and more blasé about it, now, I just don&#039;t think about the wait, I know it will come when it&#039;s time for it!<br />Basically, if you are a &quot;halfway decent person&quot;, you will be accepted and grow to love this site, if you are a dick head, expect your choices to rapidly diminish until you are thoroughly fucked off and have to sign up with a different name and address, and probably go through the same process again, because dick heads tend not to learn their lesson, and not gain a bit of humility! lol.

				Hah, good points :)<br />Great idea with purchasing the ebooks. I hadn&#039;t thought of that. Get some cred under you belt.<br />I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m a half-way decent human. I subscribe to the philosophy that we are all here together, nobody knows why or how (and if they do they&#039;re not telling anyone or proving it) and the best we can do is agree to do everything we can to make our limited existence on this weird planet the best it can be for all parties involved. Generally, an agnostic view of reality with an agreement or social contract that I&#039;ll treat others well in exchange for the hope that others will treat me well. I&#039;ll let you do whatever you want to do, so long as it doesn&#039;t harm another in exchange for you letting me do whatever I want to do so long as I don&#039;t hurt anyone in my ventures as well.<br />I would never dick anyone over. I don&#039;t know them, and they don&#039;t know me. There&#039;s a level of trust that must be had upfront, and I understand that. I haven&#039;t made a full purchase yet though, so I&#039;m not sure how the process works in detail. But I thought the escrow service took care of a lot of that?<br />I&#039;m getting a good handle on this forum, and I&#039;ve already had a few exchanges today with some sellers via pgp msg, so I may have just jumped the gun and assumed. I think a bit of the paranoia induced a slightly radical reaction.<br />I appreciate everyone&#039;s input. Thx again.

				That sucks you&#039;ve had problems getting up and running. I&#039;m about to start dropping some serious cash too and I hope I don&#039;t run into the same issues. <br /><br />I saw you in the other thread I started, but for anyone else reading this I&#039;ve started a thread that lists a bunch of vendors that are Newbie friendly and do not require FE.

				Once your first decent sized transaction goes through, you may want to try a few lottos.&nbsp; That way your stats will go from one purchase from one vendor to several from several.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t bother before a regular transaction though, since it looks fishy when you have lots of transactions but very little bitcoin spent.<br /><br />Once you pass 5 transactions &amp; 2+BTC spent then that should lower your chances of having orders canceled.&nbsp; Good luck!

				If you did that the Vendor would simply cancel your order.<br /><br />Best idea is to PM vendors which have the goodies you are after.&nbsp; Have a conversation with them - they are REAL people and will understand your questions / predicament, etc<br /><br />Any Vendor &quot;worth his salt&quot; will be able to AT LEAST come to some compromise of risk without need to FE.<br /><br />If you are after very POTENT DMT for example, we ME&#039;s would definitely do business with you and we provide excellent and constant updates, etc<br /><br /><br />UNLIKE a small minority of (used to be) great Vendors on here who have changed their attitude to avoid the EXCELLENT SR Escrow System.<br /><br />Give us a shout we will happily deal with you - PM us on the main SR Site, link to our profile below.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINEELVES

				I just made my first two orders late Friday night. Wanted to start off really small first so I just ordered some blotter and one MDMA capsule. So far no problems, they&#039;re both marked In Transit. I made sure to read all guidelines, one of the vendors wanted the address in official USPS format with the extra four digits at the end of the zip. I did have a bit of trouble with my PGP encryption but the vendor quickly messaged me to take care of it. I&#039;ll update when I get the orders on how everything goes.<br /><br />I agree that you probably should start off with something besides H as your first order, unless you just get a couple bags. I had planned on doing that myself but decided to opt for more innocuous substances for my first order. I totally agree about making sure you read EVERYTHING you can on the vendor so you can be sure you&#039;re following their specific protocol, starting off small and maybe not bugging them too much. I messaged the MDMA vendor asking for extra stealth as well with no response, but it is marked In Transit now so I guess it was fine. They probably get that all the time from first time buyers, it&#039;s probably a mark of a newbie. Guess we&#039;ve just gotta have faith in the vendors. I specifically checked their reviews for stealth ratings to be sure.
