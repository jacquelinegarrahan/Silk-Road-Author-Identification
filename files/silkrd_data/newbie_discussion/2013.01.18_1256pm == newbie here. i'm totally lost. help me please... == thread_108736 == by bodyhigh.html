				Ya&#039;ll can start with Astor&#039;s PGP tutorial:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/<br /><br />Once you think you&#039;ve got it down you can come back here and ask for someone to practice with.&nbsp; I will help anyone who asks ...<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Just noticed a PGP club for newbies started by one of the mods - that&#039;s a great place to get up to speed on GPG.&nbsp; I will post my key on that thread if anyone wants to practice&nbsp; :)

				Don&#039;t feel like you need to rush yourself. Take time to get familiar the technology. When you feel like your ready start small then work up.<br /><br />This site has a lot of information on it. Like everyone else said read as much as possible. <br /><br />That will give you at least a basic understanding of things so that when you do have a question people can help better because you could ask more narrow question.<br /><br />Is there anything more specific you are struggling with? <br /><br />Just don&#039;t overwhelm yourself. You can&#039;t learn everything in a day. U will get it.&nbsp; <br /><br />
