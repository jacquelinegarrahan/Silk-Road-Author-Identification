				Something I don&#039;t get.&nbsp; Reading many reviews I see people say, &quot;hey this was great blow, I was able to eat and sleep after an hour of doing my gram&quot;.&nbsp; Or &quot;what great stuff, didnt numb my mouth too much, and no jonsing when I was done&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was fortunate enough to live in Colombia as a teenager in the mid to late 80&#039;s, and let me tell you, those are not the signs of good coke.&nbsp; First off I will never forget the smell, it smelled kind of like a hospital, maybe slight ether or something, but very clean.&nbsp; And numbmenss after just a line, your throat, mouth, nose, face, you could probably chop it off and not feel it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eating, forget about it, no change of eating a thing, sleep, forget it, after several hours of jonsing to the max you would eventually fall asleep.&nbsp; The jonsing was probably the worst part of it, but it would fade after a few hours.&nbsp; Another thing I thought of, teeth grinding, man, it could drive you crazy.&nbsp; Lastly you could blow through an 8 ball and your nose would be none the worse for wear, no burning, stuffiness, just clean.&nbsp; As for the buzz, just pure euphoria, not speedy at all, no jitters, just a clean superman like feeling.&nbsp; I have long given up the search for that kind of blow as I guess it just dos not exist anymore (unless you get right down to the source I suppose), but still grateful that there is someplace like this around to get a small taste of the glory days.<br /><br />So to wrap up, I am thinking that most of those people that say those kind of things are the younger generation, never haven been exposed to the real thing.&nbsp; And BTW if you do happen to know where that old school stuff does exist please let me know&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />Just some thoughts.

				I hear ya.&nbsp; In my last few years down there (88,91) I was living the lifestyle, and most of the people in the business were good people.&nbsp; Like the song says, made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast.<br /><br />&nbsp;I guess the real point of my post was that it is kind of comical to hear what some people think good Coke is. Either way, I have accepted that it will never be the same, I still enjoy it though<br /><br />I still remember the days, and people always think I am full of shit, but down there at the time you did not buy it by the gram, more like the sackfull&nbsp; (ounce or so minimum)&nbsp; and no bullshit it would come out to about 3 bucks a gram, I would cut it once, and sell it for 80 bucks a G back here and it was till the best shit most had even had.&nbsp; There was no better feeling that walking through customs in Miami, and heading straight for the bathroom for the victory bump.&nbsp; Those were the days.

				CSF-<br /><br />Funny you should reply, for some reason your ads drew my attention, however your page says 5 orders minimum so I had to pass, I am almost there and look forward to giving it a shot... so can I expect that 80&#039;s feeling again&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; JK

				I know what you are talking about and you are right. I was selling something like this stuff for about five years some years ago and until now I never smelt something like that and never seen nothing so shiny!

				Like I said, you were at the top of my list as I liked what I was reading, but the 5 transaction requirement stopped me, I have 3 under my belt now, so it wont be long.

				I&#039;ve had pure coke in South America and it blew my head off, the tiniest of lines was enough to get you right up there and it lasted quite a while. The trouble with coke is everyone&#039;s perceptions differ, I would hate to be a coke vendor on SR, you could have A1 product and still get complaints from disgruntled customers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been told once too often on SR by vendors that there coke is the real deal, 87% pure with no active cuts blah blah blah. So far in 12 months on SR I can list the vendors who sell the fire on th fingers of one hand, in no particular order they are:<br /><br />* DrPVmd, currently on hiatus, much loved and missed by his customers, consistently sold decent reasonably high quality coke at afordable prices.<br />* Studio54, has the best coke on SR right now by a country mile, very clean and potent.<br />* DrCol has some very nice charlie<br />* Rails, might be giving Studio a run for his money as the crowned king of cocaine on SR, someones opinion who I trust tells me its even better than Studio54&#039;s PDS, I would need to try for myself though to see if that story holds up.<br /><br />There are obviously other solid vendors out there selling good quality stuff, my little list above is based upon my buying experiences.

				Yeah, I was in Panama in the mid eighties and can relate to the OP. 20-40 bucks per gram back in the day. Cocaine was so popular that weed dealers had garbage bags full of weed, really really cheap. I lasted about a year. Being in my early 20&#039;s at the time, moderation was not a concept I had mastered yet. :)<br /><br />Haven&#039;t found anything close in my 9 months here on the road, but every once in a while, I keep trying. Lol<br /><br />I have a gram of Rails on the way, we&#039;ll see what that is like. Some current posts say it is as good or better than Studio54&#039;s PDS, which is the current rage. Never have been able to have bitcoins in my account when the PDS is available, so far. <br /><br />

				Are those US vendors?&nbsp; Don&#039;t recognize those names, but I only browse US vendors.&nbsp; I think Europe at this point has better connections, or so it seems.<br /><br />That comment on the garbage bag made me laugh, near the end of my stint in Colombia, I would go down for two weeks or so at a time, when I would go to buy weed, it only came it large and extra large amounts (just as you describe), we would have smoke fests trying to finish it off, but in the end would just end up throwing it away, it was dirt cheap as well.

				Rails is out of Canada. Studio54 is in the US, but like I said you really have to be ready for his listings. Last time he came out with a batch for sale, it sold out in around 9 minutes, I believe.

				How long does canada mail take to get to US, back a few years ago I used to get stuff from Asia/far east and the wait was just ridiculous.

				I&#039;ve only ordered from Canada a couple of times. The last time it didn&#039;t take much longer than within the states. Around 5 days or so if memory serves me.
