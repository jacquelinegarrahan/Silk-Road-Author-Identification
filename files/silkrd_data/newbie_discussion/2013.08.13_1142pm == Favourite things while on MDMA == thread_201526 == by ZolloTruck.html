				I am interested in this topic as well, more serious answers please!<br /><br />As for me, I love talking and bonding with my friends and will now only roll with certain people who I am close to or at least somewhat close to. I won&#039;t roll with just anyone. I love menthol cigarettes as well. I generally don&#039;t smoke cigarettes but menthols are damn good while you&#039;re rollin.

				Hmm, let&#039;s see...<br />Music, Animation, Fruit, a small booster of MDMA, Pop Rocks, Porn, and my Wife (short and pretty w/big butt, big boobs, long red hair, touchably soft skin, etc), to name a few.<br /><br />Oh, and &#039;shrooms! Take a low dose of &#039;shrooms right after you peak so they hit you when you&#039;re commin&#039; down. Psilocybin synergizes remarkably well with MDMA... I LOVE IT!

				I get some MAD stim dick while on mdma. Then again, it could be due to the fact that i dose .4-.5 at a time... How much do you dose? And does meth have vasoconstriction effects? I would think they would be less as it only takes a 20mg ish dose to get high, at least for someone with no tolerance also varying on the persons weight. Though I have no experience in meth and wouldn&#039;t know. Any way to reduce stim dick? I&#039;m thinking of nitric oxide supplements, such as amino acids (l-arginine, tyrosine, etc).<br />

Not even in the sense of everyone is different, but also that every roll is different. Personal example, rolling several times off the same batch of fire stuff, there were times where I was a cuddle puddle of love, sex didn&#039;t even exist to me as a concept. Then there would be times where I was horny as hell. <br /><br />As far as getting it up on good MDMA, I find it next to impossible while you&#039;re peaking. I&#039;ve managed to get it semi stiff about, say 5 hours into the roll when I&#039;m coming back to earth a bit. But during your peak, best of luck. Much debate about using viagra to fix the problem, that&#039;s been discussed for years, but it is somewhat risky. Some factors are the impact on heart rate and blood pressure, and I read somewhere that both are metabolized with the same enzyme, prolonging your body properly metabolizing each one. <br /><br />Personally I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. With good stuff the experience alone should be amazing. And if anything, pepomaze was on point, eating pussy is amazing.

				Pretty standard stuff, listening to music (electronic based, mostly) and talk utter bollocks at each other for hours, smiling like idiots.<br /><br />I like to get up and wander about as well, and sometimes wander through the local parks if the weather&#039;s good. Amazing feeling.
