				I know this topic has been beaten to death but Ive spent several hours of time trying to figure this out doing research and still really am no better off now than when I started. Ive gone on seen the lab testing and various recommendations but its always ends up at a dead end.<br />Whenever I feel like ive found someone who checks out quality wise it always seems that they either sell in huge quantities which I dont need (im looking for grams and 1/2 grams of either mdma or coke for rec use) or theres some review about them not delivering or doing selective scamming. <br />So that leads me here. I could really some recommendations of some sellers who have quality product (mdma / coke), are reliable, and are located in the US.&nbsp; Would really appreciate any info.&nbsp; Thanks.

				If your looking locally on here, set up a face to face meeting for the first meeting or so,<br />dont transfer the bc until your satisfied, and dont be intimidated,<br />no such thing as an intimidating person as long as your willing to go the distance !

				I know what you mean!!! So fucking annoying and especially tiring. I&#039;m about to make my first order and have been doing extensive research on vendors, so here are a few you might want to look into and research yourself from what I&#039;ve been looking through: Bizarro (read he was super legit and has bomb MDMA and pills for USA), HelloMyNameIsMolly, Love (taking break for this weekend and back selling this Monday), WhiteyFord, Symbiosis, and Cher just to name a few<br />They all sell either a gram, half a gram, or both and seem pretty reputable.<br /><br />PS: If you want a possible MDA vendor, I see deadmaufive is selling LuckyLucianno&#039;s clear crystals for a veeery good price for a gram. He&#039;s pretty legit from what I&#039;ve read on his page and on the subreddit for silkroad. I might have to check him out soon so I could maybe combine a 60/40% type of dose of MDMA and MDA together lol.<br /><br />Hope this helped somewhat!&nbsp; ;D

				Hello, I have had pretty good luck with BestPricePills.&nbsp; There cola is great, they sell in different quantities and usually weigh .5 grams over plus they throw in a special treat.&nbsp; Make sure you look close into the package.&nbsp; Great stealth, communication (will work with you on amounts) and I give the yayo a 9 out of 10.&nbsp; They can be a bit pricey but they do have sales now and then.&nbsp; Usually they will have a 72 hour sale at around $90 per gr.&nbsp; You get what you pay for imho.&nbsp; Good luck

				I heard good things from<br /><br />Hallucinating Horse vendor.<br /><br />I saw some of the pictures of his product and the crystals inside the gelcaps were so shiny it made me cry.<br /><br />He was selling grams for $66 a while back, don&#039;t know if those postings are still up.
