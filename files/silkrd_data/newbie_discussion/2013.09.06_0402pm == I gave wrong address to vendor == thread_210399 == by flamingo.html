				The employee at the PO box company wrote the wrong address on the letter, one digit off. I only figured it out a week after vendors sent package.

				As a vendors, we understand that this happens.&nbsp; The best course of action is to message the vendor as fast as possible, and then try to collect the mail on your own, otherwise it could be returned to a fake return address and cause some serious raised eyebrows.&nbsp; Track these down and clean up the mess.

				Depends on what happens to those letters, they will probably end up in the dead letter room being opened by a postal inspector, if it&#039;s just small amounts they are hardly going to mount an operation on mail im that street. Just use the right address in future.

				Sucks. You just have to eat the loss and take this as a learning experience. You&#039;ll probably be fine to use the address again, since you didn&#039;t actually have the right address on the letter. If you&#039;re really paranoid and it isn&#039;t too much of a hassle then go ahead and change it for your own peace of mind, but you&#039;ll probably be fine.

				my instinct is to call the business to see if they have yet to hand it over, they wouldnt have opened it. its been nearly a week though. Dont want it opened and questions asked,&nbsp; thought the amounts are small.&nbsp; or just be super safe,&nbsp; let it go and write it off.
