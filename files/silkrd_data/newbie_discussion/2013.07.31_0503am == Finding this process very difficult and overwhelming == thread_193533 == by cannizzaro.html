				After reading through posts on this board for a few hours, all I&#039;ve achieved is the realisation that mtgox is shit and I should use localbitcoins instead and I&#039;ve made a silkroad account, a tormail account and an account on localbitcoins using my tormail address. <br /><br />All this PGP/tumbling/fogger stuff has gone straight over my head. I failed to sync tormail to Thunderbird. I don&#039;t know how a bitcoin wallet works or if I even need one on my hard drive. After reading some threads suggesting that for small purchases (personal use amounts) I shouldn&#039;t even worry about all that stuff and send bitcoins from localbitcoins straight to my silkroad wallet, I&#039;m intending to work out how to add my silkroad address to localbitcoins (Bitcoin otc signature? Bitcoin otc nick? #bitcoin-otc?) and just send them straight to silkroad once I work out how to buy bitcoins without being scammed or losing my money somehow in the process. ???<br /><br />This is becoming very frustrating and I&#039;d really appreciate some help or at least some direction as the closest posts I can find to a guide on this forum are posts similar to mine (although I&#039;m probably not looking in the right places).

				I felt that same way. After spending a few nights reading up, installing an OS on a flash drive, getting coins, tumbling coins, etc... I had enough by the time i got to PGP and said fuck it. Fast forward a year and the coins I had originally purchased were worth 10x what I paid for them, even after the price crashing. Decided to learn how to use PGP and was sending messages within like 30 min. It&#039;s like a bunch of free drug money now&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s not hard. It&#039;s just a little time consuming and maybe frustrating getting familiar with it all.<br /><br />The harder you make it to trace anything back to you, the safer you&#039;ll be, but it&#039;s not nearly as critical for personal use buyers as it is vendors.

				Lucky. Yeah... I&#039;m not too worried about protection. I just want to use silkroad. I just need to be confident in making a transaction on localbitcoins and I need to know how to link my silkroad address to localbitcoins. I don&#039;t know if anything else is necessary but it&#039;ll take way too long without help to set myself up properly and I don&#039;t have the time.

				Sorry for the late response.<br /><br />Generally I&#039;m confused about everything. But mainly: on localbitcoins, Bitcoin otc signature should be my silkroad address, right? Or an intermediate? I&#039;ll check out blockchain.info. So use my blockchain.info on localbitcoins address then use my silkroad address on blockchain.info . Is that right? Also, any tips for buying bitcoins? How can I trust someone?<br /><br />If I can manage to get bitcoins to my silkroad account it should be easy from there.

				Im still learning about the bitcoins. I found websites where you can earn them but only in microbits and I have managed to gather 6 cents in usd worth of micro bitcoins. I have found mining contracts and those are very new to me also and im not even sure if they are a scam or not. I have signed up for blockchain and so far they are pretty good as a wallet.

				Thanks for the help zxy. How will I see blockchain confirmations though? I thought I sent bitcoins to blockchain after buying them? Is there some place I put my blockchain address in? And would it be too risky buying online?
