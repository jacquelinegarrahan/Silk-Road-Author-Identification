				This vendor is really good for delivery speed and service!&nbsp; He&#039;s also willing to work problems through very easily, so full marks for UI!<br /><br />I think buyer reports are a particularly good idea here, because there is a LOT of contradictory information on the web about what BTH is and how it should be administered - particularly for injection!&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably this is because the BTH itself probably varies a shitload in composition &amp; properties between different batches, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m on an IV kick now, so I did some reading around in preparation.<br /><br />This stuff doesn&#039;t smell vinegary, and tastes bitter.&nbsp; So, it seems like the acetic acid from the manufacture has been effectively quenched.&nbsp; This is apparently not the case with some mexican BTH, as seen in the west US (according to online forums).&nbsp; This suggested to me that some citric acid might help dissolution (since the H would be in base form in BTH).&nbsp; For BTH with unquenched acetic in it, there may be enough acid in the BTH to promote dissolution (consistent with apparent lack of acid use, according to online forums).<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried two shots of this stuff.&nbsp; It gets me high, but is clearly not as powerful per unit weight as the best #4 on offer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are some notes on my two shooting experiences so far:<br /><br />GET A WHEEL FILTER IF YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT THIS!!!&nbsp; Seriously, anybody who wants to shoot this stuff needs to use a wheel filter.&nbsp; There is a SHITLOAD of apparently insoluble material, of varying size.&nbsp; I recommend 0.2 micron, because its clear from reading around that some nasty bacteria can live just fine in and on BTH.&nbsp; They can be purchased from needle exchanges for ~1 AUD.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried this twice so far, both times shooting, and I have to say it&#039;s bloody hell to work with.&nbsp; Both times I ended up with more water than I wanted (trying to dissolve it), and I&#039;ve had to divide up shots because of this (ended up with &gt;1cc!&nbsp; I don&#039;t like shooting any more volume than 50 units in a shot, normally).&nbsp; <br /><br />The first time I didn&#039;t know what I was doing, and probably ended up wasting half the shot.&nbsp; This is just because I wasn&#039;t patient enough waiting for the shit to dissolve!&nbsp; The second time I heated the mix 3-4 times in cycles, letting it cool each time before reheating.&nbsp; I even put in enough citric acid to make the sourness swamp the bitterness of the gear, but I&#039;m not sure this helped.&nbsp; Before shooting, I added some bicarb of soda to bring the pH back up a bit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want acid-scarred veins!&nbsp; I got the citric (McKenzie&#039;s) at Foodworks, in the baking section.<br /><br />The stuff is effective, but nowhere near like pure #4 in equal amounts.&nbsp; I divided my sample into 8 pieces by rolling into a bar and cutting equal pieces.&nbsp; UI says that the samples are mostly 1-2 points, so the best estimate is ~19mg/piece.&nbsp; This would be a 2-4X standard dose for pure H, according to various sources.&nbsp; I&#039;m high but not nodding right now, some 20 min after injection of one such piece.<br /><br />I will continue to post as I try to continue to work with this stuff to get it into a good shot.&nbsp; Hopefully, this will help my peers.&nbsp; From what I can glean, BTH is not the most common form of H in Oz -- although I&#039;ve heard of homebake being a sometime product of WA, and from what I understand BTH and homebake are essentially the same thing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve done two more shots since the last post, one last night and one today.&nbsp; Yesterday night I took a 1/8 piece of the sampler.&nbsp; Today I did 1/4.&nbsp; In either case it is really, really hard to get the shot volume under 1cc and still get a good solution.&nbsp; Today, with a larger amount, it was pretty hard to assess the solution anyway, because it was concentrated enough to be dark even if transparent, and seeing the particulates was hard.&nbsp; Even though I was very conservative with water at every step, there are just more occasions to add water with this stuff, and in the end I was almost exactly 1cc.&nbsp; I had to heat it one last time to try and evaporate some off.&nbsp; When I did this, I succeeded in getting the shot under 50 units.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m going to do the last bit (about 1/4 of the sampler pack) in a couple of days, in order to reduce any tolerance I&#039;ve built up experimenting so far this week.&nbsp; After that, I&#039;ll weigh in with my final assessment of whether it is worth messing with this stuff for injection.
