				Hullo!<br /><br />So I have been reading everywhere about the horror stories of Tony the H dealer and how you should never under any circumstance FE. It makes sense really. But I just tried to make my first ever SR purch and since I wasn&#039;t willing to FE the seller canceled. The vendor in question even stated on the listing, &quot;All transactions will stay in escrow, even for new buyers&quot;. &quot;Aint that some booty&quot; I though. So before I try again with a different vendor, what are some tips to complete an order-as a newbie-without being forced to FE. <br /><br />Thanks

				Message the vendor ask them a few questions keep the short and see if they are willing to deal with you through escrow dont just place an order as they dont know if you will recieve said product and delete your account which im sad to say is a problem with heroin users especially in my country

				FE is not as bad as people make out, sure you shouldnt do it but to begin with you may not have a choice just order small and do research on the vendor and if you do get scammed fuck it take the hit and you will have some stats so next time you can stay in escrow.

				An important thing to understand is that they&#039;re actually not getting their money until you finalize. Everyone who wants you to FE isn&#039;t necessarily scamming you.<br /><br />It&#039;s just that if you DO FE, you will have no recourse if they DO end up scamming you.<br /><br />Basically, don&#039;t finalize early on any order where you wouldn&#039;t be okay with just losing the money and never getting any product.

				I see. So its like a breaking-in process which I guess I&#039;m okay with. I will do what you said and msg a vendor first but if after like three attempts I guess I will just bite the bullet. <br /><br />While we are on the topic though, at what amount of transactions can you feel relatively confident that a vendor isn&#039;t going to req. a FE?

				LL vendors are different they may ask you to FE just because of where you are from ie lots of people scam from that city country etc I was buying some H this week and one vendor i have used before who requires everyone to FE and another who lets me stay in escrow its all about doing what you feel comfortable with if the FE vendor does rip me im ok with that because i FE&#039;d thats why i hedge my bets using 2 or more vendors
