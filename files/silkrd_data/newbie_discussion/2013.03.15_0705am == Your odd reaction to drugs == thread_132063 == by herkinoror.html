				So I know there have got to be some other people out there like myself that get queer reactions to drugs.&nbsp; Let us share and discuss till 50 posts! :) <br /><br />I personally am what the Shulgins termed a &quot;hard head&quot; much to my chagrin and befuddlement.&nbsp; I need sometimes signifigantly more of whatever substance we are consuming then the people I am with to get to a similar level of effects.&nbsp; For instance;&nbsp; with hatter26s BTH cold shoot most of my cohorts got their rocks off at between 10 - 15mls of the stuff whereas the bottom of my &quot;I&#039;m defenitley pleasantly high curve&quot; started at 20mls and extended all the way up to thirty for a good hard nod.&nbsp; This is with no tolerance mind you.&nbsp; And I love 2C-E.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of my favourite substances.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a pre-illegalization Gram sitting around for going to shows and for combining with other substances.&nbsp; But I pack my caps fat. Typically between 25 - 30mgs.&nbsp; When I give these to other people they lose their shit.&nbsp; Now with psychedelics in general, specifically phenethylamines, I get the same sort of reaction.&nbsp; I feel the threshold at the same level as everyone else; I had a VERY fun trip on just 7 mgs of 2C-I and again on 15 mgs however I vary rarely experience strong visuals.&nbsp; Shrooms though.&nbsp; They seem to get me though.&nbsp; I assume all of this however has to do/come from my child hood and my (probably) odd neurochemistry and phisiology.&nbsp; I&#039;m a type one Diabetic, have been since the age of 2 and I&#039;m apperently an ADHD kid.&nbsp; Thusly on top of the insulin I was prescribed all the powerful ADHD stimulants since ealry childhood.&nbsp; I think I may have been given Desoxyn one time.&nbsp; But I digress.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t seem to &quot;get&quot; the same feeling most people get from some of the most popular drugs.&nbsp; I often wonder if this is just my personal taste or if it hearkens back to my body/brain.&nbsp; I don&#039;t much like the effects of Booze,&nbsp; I used to like weed a little but now I just get really paranoid and loopy from a small amount and I seem to be sensitive to both of these in stark opposition to many other substances.&nbsp; The couple times I&#039;ve gotten my hands on pure MDMA I have not liked it much at all even though I do love other&nbsp; drugs like it (Mephedrone, Methylone, Butylone, Meth, and Amphetamine are all great).&nbsp; When I finally got a full dose all I wanted to do was Zen out.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to think, breathe, experience, or be.&nbsp; I wanted to not.&nbsp; And I certainly did not want to get up and dance, or talk to , or hug my friends.&nbsp; I have however had experiences like those which are from what I understand typical of MDMA on Mephedrone, and felt the awe and raptre of exploring a fresh new world while playing portal 2 on Methylone.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what gives?&nbsp; Do any of ya&#039;ll out there have similar stories to share?&nbsp; POSTPOSTPOST!!! ;D

				I have the ADD&#039;s, and whenever I do psychedelics my attention space becomes that of a pine cone. Nbomes have made me feel as a thought burrows out of my current line of thinking over and over and over until I have finished tripping. LSD give me panic attacks, shrooms have been hit or miss either causing me to panic / black out or experience a blissful self-actualization, mdma causes me to want the sex pretty badly, and amphetamines are boring (yet useful). <br /><br />My DoC is ketamine since it helps me treat depression, but I feel&nbsp; like I am in a different dimension where I can view reality as an interconnected mess whereas my friends feel like they are traveling through time and space while on it.<br /><br /><br />Oh I fucking hate smoking pot. I just dissociate and become paranoid after one hit from a joint. Edibles are a very different high most of the time.<br /><br />ps I accidentally got sent 4-mec from a vendor and thought it was pretty dull. It was like a retarded/light MDMA body high coupled with impaired thinking.

				You see I&#039;m all kinds of hyper but I can never be sure if I really have a neurochemistry issue.&nbsp; Nothing quite that intense happens to me on drugs, nothing like you describe anyways.&nbsp; My problem is the experience is below expectation.&nbsp; Do you figure why your trips are so crazy is because of the ADDs?

				It may sound weird but I like tripping by myself. Its the most calm, unquestionable environment.<br />I suggest to try it..

				Your body may just have a naturally high tolerance to some substances. I think my neurochemistry is definitely a factor for why my psychedelic trips tend to suck. No attention span, the inability to remember what I was thinking/talking about after 3 seconds, and the confusion is due to either ADD or some misc. neurological issue. <br /><br />I have done a lot of DPH as a teenage in order to retard myself, and sadly I think it worked.

				to elmo00:&nbsp; You tried to retard yourself?&nbsp; May I ask why? And I didn&#039;t think you could have a tolerance to just some substances. Or a natural tolerance at all.&nbsp; Is that a thing?<br /><br />to mysteryman:&nbsp; I haven&#039;t done it a lot but tripping by yourself is really awesmoe.&nbsp; A great tool for self exploration!&nbsp; Or even just being away from your group for a small part of the trip.&nbsp; But I also enjoy tripping wit my friends a) for the company in a wierd situation and in case of ANY problem b) for the bonding experience and c)in the hopes of the ellusive shared experience/delusion.

				My odd reaction to anything I take for the first time is that something tells me that life is fake and I am going back where I came from. That really makes me scared for when I die. Salvia was the most frightening, but weed did the same thing to me when I was a teen.

				Once when I did salvia I saw what I was going to do ahead of time and no matter what I did I synced up to what I saw, like I had already made the choice to do so and now I just have to experience why..<br /><br />At least thats what I got out of it

				Ya man I feel like every time I have dejavu its what I saw on Salvia. Salvia is some crazy shit. I&#039;m too scared to try it again, so its just been sitting in a bag since 2010.
