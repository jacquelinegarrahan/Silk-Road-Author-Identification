				Hello guys. As you can see I am TorUser1549 (impossible being more anonymous). I don&#039;t want to spam my whole way to 50 so I want to create interesting threads and posts. This is my first try though.<br /><br />I want you to recommend me drugs I have not tried many and I want to try as many as I can and now that I know the road I believe that trying most of them is possible.<br /><br />I tried extasis pills only twice I loved them, I like to rave but there are not many raves were I live so I don&#039;t have many opportunities of taking party drugs yet I realy liked extasis. I also tried acid I am not sure if it was LSD because it had a funny taste but I liked it I used it twice from the same blotter and both times it was an awesome experience. I also like to smoke weed and chill, but I believe everyone here does :D Hahaha.<br />Summing it up I like to party and rave yet I like to take psycoelics and weed chilling and having a good time. <br /><br />So will you recommend me some drugs or what? <br />Haha. Peace

				I&#039;m with you on not spamming to 50. I mean, by the time I actually get a post to submit through tor, I may as well have written a proper post.<br /><br />I think you already did all the good drugs. LSD can be good in a rave setting, if it&#039;s on the more psychedelic side of things.<br /><br />You&#039;d probably like mushrooms as they are a bit more chilled and weird than LSD in my opinion.T

				Yeah, I know some people who are like that too. It&#039;s relatively safe since it is used as anesthetic, but like anything it can definitely be bad if abused.<br /><br />Let&#039;s see... Adderall (speed) is fun as well, but higher risk for issues if you have an addictive personality. Absolute best experience of my life was a rave on LSD, MXE &amp; Adderall.

				I would recommend 2c-b. It is a great party drug on lower doses, but at higher it very visually intense, yet it leaves you mind quite clear. It has also gotten much praise for its sexual properties.<br /><br />As I understand you don&#039;t NEED to snort Keth, but many prefer it since it is more potent nasally than orally, and is easier to dose/redose.<br /><br />Salvia is also an interesting drug, but very very strange.

				I accidentally snorted 50mg of 2c-b and that was not fun. It would of been fun I was just in the wrong setting. I had a &quot;Fuck it... YOLO&quot; moment before going into a typical night club and snorted 50mg of 2c-b instead of the planned 10mg. By the time I walked in I realized shit was about to get intense. After I used the bathroom the attendant forced soap on me to wash my hands but I could not figure out what it was for and I put it in my hair as a gel and walked out. I started looping around the dance floor when my friends found me and told me I was tripping and ended up just spending the rest of the night chilling inside of the car in the garage freaking out because of how intense it was and the typical &quot;There is no running away from this experience&quot; feeling. It was a terrible night and because of that I don&#039;t think I could ever even attempt to party on 2c-b again! If I was in a rave where people looping out was common I probably would of had a better experience. <br /><br />I want to try 5-meo-mipt. It sounds a lot more promising as a party drug.

Nasally my guesstimate is that it would feel like 70 mg orally. You must have been way out of the atmosphere, perhaps even past Jupiter. I took 23-26 mg orally at a rave, tripped balls and had an amazing night. Would probably not go higher on a party. Live and learn from mistakes, right? :) Thanks for sharing!

				I guess it depends on what you are looking to experience.&nbsp; Some people are looking to just get high.&nbsp; Others are looking for an experience, something life changing.&nbsp; Native Americans go on a walkabout when they come of age and there are several other drugs used for spiritual experiences such as LSD which has been used in the past to help cure alcoholism.&nbsp; DMT is supposed to be another drug that is used for life changing experiences.&nbsp; The answer really depends on you.

				I am a huge fan of opiates, but they are a slippery slope, and super addictive. I&#039;d recommend staying away if you have any kind of addictive personality. <br /><br />GOOD cocaine - there is nothing like it. But buying blow on the street these days is never good, it almost always cut to shit and you most likely are getting any actual cocaine. IF you can find good coke, its an amazing experience. I will tell you though, the first time you do it will be the best and you will want to chase that high... you wont get it! As with all drugs, enjoy responsibly.

				50mg of 2c-b is far too much for first time. I find 25mg is perfect insufflated, 45-50mg oral but waiting 2-3hrs to peak blows. Its well worth the pain and for the record insufflation is half what u need orally.<br /><br />But 2c-b is great, mixed with LSD is awesome.<br /><br />Lots of fun stuff, lots of bad. Regardless you must research things and get proper scale.<br /><br />Happy tripping :)

				Probably the best idea! I wish I could just smoke weed, but it messes with my head. FUCKS me up far worse than any other hard drug ever has. I would never touch LSD, or shrooms, or anything that would make me trip. I like to stay in control of my reality.. lol. <br /><br />Ever thought about mescaline??

If you have under lying mental problems then drugs in general should be avoided. Unless you just tried it once or twice and did it wrong which happens it can make for a bad time and discourage further use. I myself loathed weed to the point I stopped speaking to my druggie friends (15years ago) and I also felt LSD etc was terrible.<br /><br />In proper setting, with a sitter and using correct doses its an amazing life changing experience. <br /><br />Most commonly said by new LSD users from my personal experiences is along lines of &quot;why are people so terrified of doing this, it&#039;s amazing&quot;<br /><br />Lots of drugs are lame and lead you down a bad miserable road. Research research research.
