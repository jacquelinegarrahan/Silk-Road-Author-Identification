				i think my tolerance level has increased but i dnt even snort that often ( once every two weeks a gram maybe) any suggestions to bring it down ???? secondly i noticed after trying many types of cokes with some it feels like serotonin reuptake receptors have been effected by coke n you feel proper euphoric, energetic, talkative and a bit hyper. on the other hand with some types of coke you feel like smooth buzz&nbsp; with a little bit of alertness and feeling of being happy but not intense though. so which one is the true coke and which ones false and what is it exactly then. being a doctor i guess i have this weird habit of going into details.<br />excuse me if i am being annoying lolzz...<br />best vendors doing coke on SR any idea ???????/ i just joined recently

				One word - rocketfuel. <br /><br />I&#039;m not big on coke, in fact I havent had it for years. I remember the best I ever had back in the day though, felt almost like a small dose of MDMA in some ways. So yeah, euphoric, exciting, and no anxiety at all. Also a smooth comedown and not as hard as expected to get to sleep. <br /><br />Other times i&#039;ve had some awful stuff, keeps you talking, you&#039;re literally fighting to speak over people - and your heart is beating out of your chest. That, I believe, is crappy coke.

				Pure cocaine shouldn&#039;t have any speedy edge to it. Should be numbing of face, a little energy mixed with pretty heavy euphoria! If u feel like you want to crawl out of your skin, its cut with an amphetamine of some sort. Whats the road used?

				The samples i&#039;ve had in South America seemed to feel more like an mdma buzz, but alot smoother. Especially with the coming up. <br /><br />What i&#039;ve assumed to be lesser quality in other countries made me feel alot more wired, and more talkative without as much empathy.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never tested any coke before so who knows what the differences in strength, and what they were cut with.<br />

				thanks guys for replying actually i had my first transaction with dispater for coke, delivery and communication was good but not sure about the quality, alot of anxiety, slight euphoria, no energy at all a little bit alert and my heart beating like around 135. was nt much of a fun really and buzz lasted for 15 to 20 minutes, but it was bit better than the street ones nice smell, easy to snort and no inflames nose or sinusitis after.<br />now&nbsp; i have to order again dnt know where from this time. <br />one of my dealers, he used to sell 60 pounds a gram and his coke was very hard on nose n throat but quality wise energy, bursts of euphoria, a little bit speedy, no heart racing, no anxiety at all just wanted to cuddle everyone lolzz dnt know what he used to cut it with and nose used to be runny n blocked for days........now confused where to buy from
