				A guy walks into a sperm donor bank wearing a ski mask and holding a gun. He goes up to the nurse and demands her to open the sperm bank vault. She says &quot;But sir, its just a sperm bank!&quot;, &quot;I don&#039;t care, open it now!!!&quot; he replies. So she opens the door to the vault and inside are all the sperm samples. The guy says &quot;Take one of those sperm samples and drink it!&quot;, she looks at him &quot;BUT, they are sperm samples???&quot; , &quot;DO IT!&quot;. So the nurse sucks it back. &quot;That one there, drink that one as well.&quot;, so the nurse drinks that one as well. Finally after 4 samples the man takes off his ski mask and says, &quot;See honey - its not that hard.&quot;

				A conference speaker asks how often the attendees had sex. He first asks for a show of hands of all the people who had sex almost every night. A modest number of hands were raised. He then asks, how many had sex once a week? This time a larger number of hands were raised. He then asks how many had sex once or twice a month? Again a few hands were raised. After He polled his group several more times he noticed one guy sitting off to the side with this huge beaming grin on his face. He noticed that the guy never raised his hand, so he asked him how often he had sex. <br /><br />The guy said, &quot;Once a year!&quot;<br /><br />The speaker asks, &quot;Why are you so happy getting sex only once a year?&quot;<br /><br />The grinning guy responds, &quot;Tonight&#039;s the night!&quot;

I&#039;m off to Europe in the morning, and if you like, I can stow you away on my ship. I&#039;ll take good care of you and bring you food every day.&quot; Moving closer, he slipped his arm around her shoulder and added, &quot;I&#039;ll keep you happy, and you&#039;ll keep me happy.&quot;<br /><br />The girl nodded yes, after all, what did she have to lose? That night, the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he brought her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit, and they made passionate love until dawn.<br /><br />Three weeks later, during a routine search, she was discovered by the captain. &#039;What are you doing here?&#039; the captain asked.

				A guy is driving out in the middle of nowhere, very lost. Finally he spots 2 houses so he goes up to the first house and looks in the door way. He sees an old lady yanking on her boobs and an old man jerking off. He is so freaked out that he goes to the next house and says &quot;What&#039;s up with your neighbors?&quot; and the owner of the house says &quot;Oh that&#039;s the Robinson&#039;s, they&#039;re both deaf. She&#039;s telling him to go milk the cow and he&#039;s telling her to go fuck herself!&quot;

				Do you know what Rodeo Sex is?<br /><br />It&#039;s when you mount your woman from behind, start going nice and slowly, take her hair and pull her head back slightly and whisper in her ear &quot;Your sister was better than you...&quot;, and try to hold on for 8 seconds!

				A young husband and wife were sunning on a nude beach when a wasp buzzed into the woman&#039;s vagina. The husband covered her with a coat, pulled on his shorts, carried her to the car and made a dash to the hospital.<br /><br />After examining her, the doctor explained that the wasp was too far in to be reached with forceps. He suggested the husband try to entice it out by putting honey on his penis, penetrating her and withdrawing as soon as he felt the wasp.<br /><br />The man agreed to try, but because he was so nervous, he couldn&#039;t rise to the occasion. &quot;if neither of you objects,&quot; the medic said, &quot;I could give it a try.&quot;<br /><br />Under the circumstances, both agreed. The doctor quickly undressed, slathered on some honey and mounted the woman. The husband watched with increasing alarm as the doctor&#039;s thrust continued for several long minutes. &quot;Hey, What the hell is happening?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Change of plans,&quot; The physician panted. &quot; I&#039;m going to drown the little bastard!.&quot;

				Little jimmy went to the red light district to get a hooker holding a dead frog. He told the pimp &quot;I want a hooker with herpes&quot;. The pimp, surprised as one would be, asked why little jimmy specifically wanted a hooker with herpes, and little jimmy answered.<br /><br />&quot;You see, when I get home my babysitter will have sex with me and get herpes, then when he drives the babysitter home she he will pay her with sex. Then when father gets home he will have sex with my mother, which will give her herpes and then when he leaves for work she will fuck the mail man as usual, and that fucker ran over my frog!&quot;
