				In debating making this topic, after searching for a similar one, decided it was best to make it.&nbsp; Obviously the best advice is to never FE but in some cases you may take the risk.&nbsp; I just FE with an order for BaddaBoom because my SR account has no purchase history I figured I would give him a shot and update when necessary.&nbsp; Anyone else, in a similar position, want to add which vendor decided to take your money and run?

				Just get some filthy cheap things to get your rep up. But once it&#039;s up, don&#039;t FE! Escrow is your friend and there to protect you. If you get scammed it is your own fault, IMO.

				You have to understand it from both sides - obviously tracking is problematic, so a lot of the community is still very much based on trust.<br />For sellers that require FE even for established users, yeah... avoid.

				if everybody with good buying stats would just agree to never FE there wouldn&#039;t be so many vendors who request it.<br />Anyways I agree that there is also a scam problem from the vendors point of view. fuckin prisoner&#039;s dilemma...

				Escrow is your best friend. :P<br /><br />Never do anything other than escrow unless you completely trust the vendor.
