				So.......<br />Im pretty new here and still learning the ropes.<br />Last week I bought a few bits just to help get my stats up before any bigger purchases, and just generally get acquainted with everything.<br />Everything turned up apart from a gram of ket - it was a domestic purchase and its been about a week since it was put in transit so im pretty sure its a no show. I have an online business (a legal one!) and I know that packages do go missing from time to time - probably about 1 in every 120 packages go missing with RM. Anyway I have a few questions that the more enlightened might be able to throw some light on<br /><br />1) I&#039;m pretty sure the guy sent it because we have exchanged a few messages - is there now a package floating around the system with ket and my name and postal addy, and what are the consequences?<br />2) If the worst comes to the worst and it ends up in resolution, even if admin find in my favor, my stats will have a massive refund rate - will this show as a proportion of total money spent or transactions refunded?<br />3) Given it was a pretty small purchase might it be best to just finalize to protect my stats, even if I never received? Has anyone else ever done this or am I just being a massive pansy?<br />4)Will they find in my favor anyway? The seller is fairly new but all his other customers seem to be pretty happy and he has 5/5 ratings<br /><br />Any advice?<br />Much appreciated

				lol, no i didnt even think to call them. The package wasnt tracked so im not sure if they would be able to do anything about it anyway. Maybe I will give them a call just to see.<br />If anyone has any advice on the other stuff, would be a help.

				Are you in the UK, by any chance? I know for a fact that Royal Mail have been doing an exercise on sizing issues for mail in transit through their system and are looking to see if there are correct postages being paid on a large selection of mail atm. I know as I had to go collect a package that was deemed incorrectly &#039;postaged up&#039; and pay the difference. Thing is it was the exact same size as I had received previously and looked to be correctly paid to my eyes and also the postmaster that was apologising to me when asking for more money!! You will get a card in a couple of days stating the fact that they are holding mail for you. They&#039;ve gone a bit mental on this over the last couple of weeks.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not in the UK then you&#039;re probably fucked ;)
