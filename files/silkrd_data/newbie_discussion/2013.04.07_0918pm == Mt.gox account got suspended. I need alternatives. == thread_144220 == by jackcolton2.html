				I opened up an account with mt. gox yesterday and without quite doing enough research, I tried to withdraw to my SR wallet while on TOR. This prompted a flag on my account and now I have to wait for the account to be verified which is like 5 to 10 days of waiting. <br /><br />So here&#039;s my question. Can anyone give me advice on how to safely convert USD into BTC that is as fast as mt. gox? Sucks that I have a lot of BTC locked, but I need alternatives. I know there&#039;s a lot of material on the forums about this very same thing, but the search function on the forums is so bad. I have to filter through so much unrelated material. Please, any name of alternative sites or pointing in the right direction will help. <br /><br />JC

				If you are in the US and are near a Bank of America, then BitFloor, in my opinion, is the way to go. Cash deposit at a nearby BofA, your funds show up in 5-10 minutes in your BitFloor account ready to purchase coins.

				Are there any other sites? Bitfloor homepage says they&#039;re &quot;experiencing issues&quot;. Thank you for the suggestion.

				It said the same thing two days ago when I used it and it was fine. I&#039;m not aware of any other sites unfortunately. There is Coinbase (where you can buy coins with a debit/credit card) but it takes a friggin&#039; week for you to get your coins. Bitfloor is by far the best... and don&#039;t quote me on this but I think some of the issues Bitfloor has been having may have something to do with the entire Bitcoin infrastructure as whole. Again, not sure, and I hope someone can lend you more insight. In any case, I know you want to be careful with your funds and stuff but I would suggest maybe just putting through a little amount on Bitfloor. They&#039;ve never failed me. Good luck man.

				Thanks for the input, ozy. I tried doing bitfloor, but bank of america is closed here and i need to get the money asap. They offer wire transfers, but that takes 1-2 days. Do you know any other reliable services? Can anyone else advise?

				As others have stated, use Bitfloor/Localtill for BUYING Bitcoins. The Bitfloor market usually lags behind other markets due to the lower volume but you will have your USD in your account in less than 5minutes! I tested this by hitting the refresh button constantly immediately after my first deposit. I think the actual time was 3.5minutes which is extremely impressive!<br /><br />You can buy from people who advertise Bitcoin sales. There&#039;s a few sites out there where you can accomplish this. I would just say wait till Monday and go to BOA to make a deposit through LocalTill (Using Bitfloor).<br /><br />-CC

I&#039;ve had a situation where I needed to get something ordered by 12pm and made it to BofA when they opened at 9am to deposit into LocalTill/BitFloor, pass coins through a few wallets and finally into my SR wallet. Got it done by 10:30am or so. It may not be typical because I&#039;ve had times where transfers to my SR wallet take a little longer but the point remains that I think waiting til Monday to do Bitfloor is your best bet. Good luck bud.

				Thank you, Ozy. After all the scrambling today, I decided to deposit into bitfloor tomorrow morning as you suggest. I was in the process of opening a new mt.gox account and depositing, but I have a distaste for their site because of all the hoops they made me jump through. Plus, the smaller cut bitfloor takes and the ease of depositing money at bofa is very very appealing. I guess I&#039;ll just have to make up an excuse at work and make a stop at bofa in the morning. Thanks Ozy and Cannabis! <br /><br />JC

				JC,<br /><br />Don&#039;t flip out if you tried Bitfloor today and it didn&#039;t go smoothly. LocalTill (BitFloor&#039;s payment processor) is having some technical difficulties that are being resolved. I deposited some money today a few hours and hasn&#039;t shown up yet but this is def. an anomaly as I&#039;ve made many other deposits with the funds showing up in literally minutes. Bitfloor is 100% legit and I&#039;ve done research to show that this is NOT a security issue. Just a technical issue with LocalTill.<br /><br />ozy

				Both Bitfloor and Bitinstant have been having problems. I used both very recently and nothings shown up at my addresses yet. Sent Bitinstant so many messages on bitcointalk support thread, private messages on bitcointalk to bitinstant customer support, emailed bitinstant, tried calling them but they just have a voicemail so hung up. No acknowledgement at all and I was freaking out<br /><br />They finally responded and now I have a support ticket (whatever that means). I&#039;m not expecting to see btc anytime soon since people on the forum have been complaining for weeks now<br /><br />After that shit, I decided to test bitfloor. Havent got my btc from them either... Lets see what happens

				Dragon Ball, I got bitfloor to work for me today. Other than SR being shutdown for maintenance for a few hours earlier today, I was successful in getting BTC into my SR wallet. I&#039;m sorry you&#039;re having problems. <br /><br />SW, the mt.gox account got put on hold because i was on the site and withdrawing using my TOR browser. I later read on these forums and on the mtgox.com website that they will suspend and require verification on mtgox accounts that are accessed with TOR browsers. Funny thing is, I got one transfer through mtgox to go through, but it was my second withdraw that got me in trouble with mtgox.

But they&#039;re given at the current rate, which is ridiculous!! I&#039;m opening another ticket with Bitinstant to have them honor their guarantee. The CEO of Bitinstant came on the forums and said he&#039;d give the exact rate at the time of the deposit CLEARNET WARNING **** https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128314.msg1776479#msg1776479&nbsp; **** CLEARNET WARNING. So let&#039;s see about that!!!<br /><br />Still waiting on Bitfloor. No response from their email support yet, but their twitter says that LocalTill, their cash deposit processor, is having problems. And seeing how late it is for them, they&#039;ll work on it when its morning there. <br /><br />I think there&#039;s just a ridiculous amount of volume right now that everyone&#039;s shit is getting jammed up the ass. <br />So do tell how this moneypak thing works?
