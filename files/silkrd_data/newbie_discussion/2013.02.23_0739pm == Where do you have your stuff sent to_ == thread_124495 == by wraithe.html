				disclaimer: never made a purchase on SR (not yet anyways...) However, I&#039;ve done a lot of research on these boards and can likely summarize what most will say.<br /><br />&gt; For small amounts used for personal consumption, most on here would likely advise you to send it to your home address. <br />&gt; For larger quantities, or more frequent orders, you may feel safer having it sent to a PO box or a mailbox at a mom &amp; pop shop.<br />&gt; Mom &amp; pop shop mailboxes appear to be what most on here recommend because they usually have less security.<br />&gt; If you go the mailbox/PO box route, don&#039;t use a fake ID because then you could get in trouble for mail fraud or identity fraud, etc.<br />&gt; Most will tell you NOT to have orders shipped to an abandoned house or something like that because the orders are far less likely to arrive.<br />&gt; Though not the majority, quite a few members seem to use a drop-house where they pay someone to accept deliveries for them. This is risky, but appears to work for some. Others believe that doing so is pretty shitty of you because you&#039;re putting others at risk.<br /><br />hope this helps!<br />

				Here is a related question...<br />In the future I am thinking about opening a vendor account and selling on SR.<br />When I send out my packages do I include a return address? Seems like a silly question but I&#039;ve heard post office won&#039;t ship without a return here in the US?<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />Peace

It makes the package/envelope look more legitimate and there really is no harm in using a fake return address. Also don&#039;t forget to use different drop-points around your city and in neighboring towns as well. Makes it harder for them to trace you and plus you don&#039;t want LE to know exactly where you are shipping from. 8)
