				Hi! I&#039;m trappy. I&#039;ve been here a pretty damn long time for a newbie.<br /><br />Rule one: Do not FE<br />Rule two: If you FE, allow the review box to hang there. You will not update your review box after your package arrives. You will give your FIRST review when the package arrives, and your second review after your have enjoyed a portion of it.<br /><br />Note: If you only receive a 50% or less refund... You have been FUCKED. Slightly more subtly, but still fucked. Real vendors offer 96% refunds.<br /><br />I want to hear YOUR stories, fellow and former newbies. Who fucked you over, and who was awesome? Do not hesitate to name names. <br /><br /><br />Absolutely do not hesitate to contact DPR and SR support when abused. They will do whats in their power to help you. Vendors DO get banned, and if we remain vigilant, more will get banned, and SR will be safer for everyone.<br /><br />Few vendors fuck over everyone. Its selective scammers we need to watch out for.

				I have been having some issues with Supertrips. Ordered over a month ago and FE&#039;d like an idiot. He had a pretty good reputation though so I gave him a shot. No package now and very very slow customer service. Finally said he was going to give me a refund several days ago but nothing has shown up yet in my BC account. I am hoping he is just super slammed with orders (not that thats an excuse for poor customer service) and will get me my money back or give me a reship.

				fatcats1234... Its somewhat well known, that Supertrips is an unreliable vendor.<br /><br />I wish you the best, but you may have been fucked. Get your 50 posts and add your story to the rumor mill.
