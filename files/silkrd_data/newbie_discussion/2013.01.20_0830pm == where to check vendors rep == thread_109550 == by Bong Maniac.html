				i placed an order with pinkyandthebrain yesterday and he hasn&#039;t gotten back to me yet.&nbsp; has anyone had dealings with him? it says &quot;has been a member for 2 months<br />was last seen: today<br />ranked in the top 33% of sellers with 100% positive feedback from 70 transactions<br />has 123 fans &quot;<br /><br />is there a place in the forum to check on vendors reputability? i looked around and couldn&#039;t find any such place.<br /><br />also, in my order for shipping i checked &quot;europe&quot; at .14 BTC. is that only for delivering to europe? i need it to come to north america.. i&#039;m worried because there was a &quot;world&quot; option and i chose europe. is this going to be a problem? i&#039;m not worried about it being lost or seized&nbsp; as it&#039;s such a small package and lsd is odorless.<br /><br />can anyone please help ease my concerns?

				A vendor&#039;s page is typically the best place to check their reputation.&nbsp; The information you quoted speaks very well of him, and then you can also find feedback at the bottom of his page.<br /><br />It&#039;s the weekend.&nbsp; Vendor&#039;s aren&#039;t Amazon, and even most small businesses don&#039;t operate over the weekend.&nbsp; Did you send him a message or did you simply place an order?<br /><br />If the only shipping option was Europe then I&#039;m not clear why you went ahead and ordered rather than sending him an inquiry, but I suppose he can always just cancel your order.

The rating scale only works when used in tandem with the forums by buyers.<br /><br />Also be cautious regarding new vendors offering too good to be true prices, one MDMA vendor whose listings were very competitively priced appears to have disappeared over the weekend, don&#039;t know what happened yet but anyone who FE&#039;d can be sure they have lost their coins.

				There are three main ways to evaluate a vendor&#039;s rep all based on the forums and ideally all should be used in conjunction. If noone is posting about them in the forums then they are probably not a good vendor to deal with. <br /><br />1 search for the vendors name in the forum search and read all posts with that vendor&#039;s name in them<br />2 read all the posts in threads about that vendor<br />3 click on the forum profile of the vendor in question and click &quot;show posts&quot; to see all of the posts that vendor has made<br /><br />if the vendor is reputable and cares about the community all of these searches will turn up positive results

				The best way to check the rep of a vendor is looking at their page and numbers such as ranking and feedback percentage, in other words looking at facts not made up rumors with the purpose of slandering a vendor. I know as a fact that people lie about vendors in Rumer Mill forum.<br /><br />The vendor you ordered from sounds legit, he has 100% feedback but he is a newbie (only two months as vendor) which is the only negative I see. However he/she will probably cancel order bc if he only ships to Europe he will only have Europe as a shipping option and you did not message him/her first to find out if he will do an exception for you. You messaged him today and he has not reply yet, all businesses have a standard 48 hour rule to return messages so just be a little patient, I am sure vendor will get back to you as soon as he he can, He/She is probably just really busy.<br /><br />
