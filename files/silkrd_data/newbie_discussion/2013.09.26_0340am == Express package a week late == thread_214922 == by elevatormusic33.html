				I ordered last Thursday, got a tracking number and it stops updating after &quot;acceptance&quot; and &quot; dispatched to sort facility&quot;. There&#039;s about 6 or 7 other people that also haven&#039;t gotten their packages from that day. However, people that have ordered after thurs have been getting theirs. Vendor sent out a message Monday just saying that there is an issue with our packages, that he was&nbsp; inquiring with usps, and that basically we are at their mercy. He hasn&#039;t responded to any other messages after Monday, and all communication is encrypted.<br /><br />Anyone have any experience with an issue like this. His stealth is some of the best I&#039;ve ever seen. He&#039;s a top vendor on SR, so I&#039;m doubting tgere&#039;s a scam going on. If its a usps fuck up then what could possibly be going on. <br /><br />If this goes to resolution, would SR support rule in our favor? I&#039;d like either a refund or a reship, but at this point I&#039;m more concerned for my freedom.

				Just keep checking up on things.<br />Make sure you&#039;re place of res is clean.<br />Clear all of your computers that you&#039;ve used Tor on. Back everything up that you need (that isn&#039;t illegal)<br />wipe all your drives just in case. Make at least 7 passes with a disc shredder to make it impossible to recover any data.<br />Reload your software, and all of your backups.<br />If they come a knockin&#039;, deny deny deny. You never knew anything about the package. For all you know, someone shipped it to you or your friends or whatever, in an attempt to get you in trouble, or in hopes they could come claim it from you.<br />Remember: your name on a package doesn&#039;t mean shit. You don&#039;t know anything about it.<br /><br />Hopefully you did it all for nothing, but it&#039;s better to be safe than sorry.<br />I&#039;d try to continue to get in touch with your seller and only login from coffee shops.

				Sounds like all packages have been seized. Proceed accordingly. Pretty much what the guy above me said.
