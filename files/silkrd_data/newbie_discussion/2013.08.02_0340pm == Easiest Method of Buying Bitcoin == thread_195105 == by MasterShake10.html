				In Canada there is one company (canadianbitcoins.com) which allows cash through Xpresspost. I sent the cash with tracking and required a signature and it only took about 3 business days and it was in my account no problems at all. Not sure, but I assume there are companies that offer a similar service in other countries.

				<br />The coins go into escrow like SR and when you make the payment the seller releases the coins to you but if he doesn&#039;t you will have the details about the payment being made but all this aside the guys with 100% on there don&#039;t mess about in my experience. <br /><br />You can try Dmtrik on there if you&#039;re in the UK. Never had a problem with him and he has never let anyone down thus far. <br /><br />M

				Shake I used MoneyHoney under the money section. Bought Vanilla card (anonymous) and did the deal. It&#039;s always a gamble, but I checked the reviews and took the chance. there percentage is high but seeing what people were charging on Localinstant not killing me but close to their rate. Was quick easy and money straight into my account, already on the road. I JUST WISH BITINSTANT WAS BACK UP!!! Sorry just frustrated with them. Thats the was the way to go!

				www.Bitcoin-brokers.org<br /><br />Cash deposits at either Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank.<br /><br />Bitcoin received the same day.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t get any easier than this.<br /><br />I personally can&#039;t stand localbitcoins.com...maybe I was just unlucky but sitting around waiting to meet a dude who has no respect for my personal time just ticks me off.<br /><br />Bitcoin-Brokers doesn&#039;t make you wait around for the second party.

				cashintocoins.com is pretty great. The guy who runs it is really friendly and responds to emails really quickly. They&#039;ve been a little strained by the increased demand since bitinstant died so he runs out of BTC before the end of the day sometimes but he&#039;s super reliable. <br /><br />To get BTC you make a cash deposit either at Wells Fargo or Chase. Then you take the receipt from that deposit, write the date, your order number and the amount deposited on the receipt, take a picture of it and email the picture to the guy with the wallet address you want to send the BTC to. Usually, the coins show up in my account within a few hours. The longest I&#039;ve had to wait was until the end of the day once when he was really overwhelmed. The main plus to using cashintocoins is how awesome the customer service is. <br /><br />There&#039;s also BTCquick.com. You do have to verify your identity by uploading a picture of a photo ID. You can use credit or debit and it actually is pretty much instant after you get verified.&nbsp;

You have to set up the order through one of the companies on localbitcoins.com to get account info. Once they send it to you, you have a certain amount of time to get to a WellsFargo Bank and you deposit your cash into their bank account. Once you verify the successful transaction, they will send your bitcoins. However, watch their rules, most don&#039;t want to hear that you even talked about bitcoins near the bank.

				If you&#039;re in the UK I&#039;m pretty good to buy bitcoins off if I&#039;m online. Will take as long as walking to your local shop to get the Ukash voucher.<br />Coins transferred straight to your SR account.
