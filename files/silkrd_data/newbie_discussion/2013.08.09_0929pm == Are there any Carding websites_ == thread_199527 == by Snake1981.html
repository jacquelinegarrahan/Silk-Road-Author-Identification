				I know you didn&#039;t ask for advice or anything, but if you want my two cents, you should go jump off a fucking cliff.<br /><br />If you need to make money, get a damn job instead of stealing other peoples&#039; shit.<br /><br />I hope you learn your lesson the hard way, scumbag.

				im just trying to get 50 posts, but in all honesty dont you think that people who card are not stealing from the people, its the banks that have to pay that money that was stolen. I have never stolen any money from credit cards personally, but there was this one time my credit card number was stolen and charged in a different state so the bank new that it wasnt me who charged the carf and refunded back my money. in his defense hes stealing from the banks. the same banks that have put this county thru depression and recession since America filed for bankruptcy since 1913. now if he was stealing someones identity thats a different story cause that causes the people to suffer. but i say fuck the banks and card on...
