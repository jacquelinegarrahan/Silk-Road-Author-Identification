				Character name from a short story I&#039;m writing. I don&#039;t publish, I just write for fun, so no worries about anybody making the connection. Plus, I think it has a nice ring to it, and it&#039;s different to every other alias I use online.

				Good question. I like to dance. That&#039;s about as much relation there is to me. I also was trying to avoid picking anything that was related to me, so I decided to go with something so lame that there was no way I would want to use it on a clear net site where my anonymity wasn&#039;t as important. Thus, I went about choosing a name that a 13 year old might pick for their AIM screenname.

				I just look around whenever I feel like using something that is not habitual.<br />I was with my roommate who happens to be an Asian with a Canadian passport<br />So I guess he&#039;s the one taking the fire when the cops show up at our door :-\&nbsp; :-X<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />&nbsp;::)

				In a desperate struggle to choose an alias I&#039;ve never used before I remembered reading about Heracles when deciding whether or not to read Plato&#039;s Symposium. &quot;Knows&quot; just happened to fit onto the end, I don&#039;t know why - it just popped into my head.<br /><br />Anyhow, it turns out there&#039;s a machine called the &quot;Heracles Nose&quot; which is a laboratory smell analyzer. So...
