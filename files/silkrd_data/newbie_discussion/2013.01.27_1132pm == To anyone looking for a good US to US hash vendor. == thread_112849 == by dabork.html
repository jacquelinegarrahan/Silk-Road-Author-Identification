				Might as well make my first post here something useful.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for domestic hash but don&#039;t feel like dropping 35 bucks a gram check out UndergroundSyndicate&#039;s Moroccan hash.&nbsp; I got a gram for my first purchase on the road and was completely satisfied.&nbsp; I ordered it on a Monday night with priority shipping for about $26 total and had it in my hands (and under a cup) Friday afternoon.&nbsp; Packaging was completely inconspicuous with no smell to speak of until I could actually see the hash.&nbsp; The hash is hard but not brittle and can be sliced or shaved easily with a good razor.&nbsp; It&#039;s also not too sticky, which made it very easy to manage.&nbsp; The smoke is pure white and smooth as butter.&nbsp; Slight hints of spice in the smoke and in the smell.&nbsp; Very mellowing high without any real couch-lock.&nbsp; I smoke about half the gram in small amounts, and will get a chance to smoke a nice chunk of it once my birthday comes around, which was the whole reason I bought it.&nbsp; Overall, I had no complaints at all.&nbsp; I had my insecurities about this site just like most people but if this guy is any example of what to expect from the high rated vendors around here, I will certainly not think twice about ordering again.&nbsp; It&#039;s not the most potent hash here, but it did it&#039;s job just fine for me, it&#039;s also at $22/g right now, so it&#039;s close to the cheapest you can get.<br /><br />10/10 all the way around, from packaging to product.<br />Listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ce3df07568<br />

				Good to know!! Any experience with any of his other products? I know he resells SuperTrips&#039; MDMA which has outstanding reviews, but i&#039;m still a tad hesitant to give him all my business quite yet.

				I&#039;m confused, it sounds from your post this was your first purchase on SR then it sounds like you know all about other hash here.

I&#039;m currently waiting on a 50 g order from him right now.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend him for anyone looking for a reliable hash vendor with good prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I know your talking about US to US vendors, but with the way things from Portugal get into the US, i thought I&#039;d just chip this is.<br /><br />His highest price for morrocan hash is 10 a g, when you wanna only buy two, so his prices are pretty hard to beat, unless you wanna go with a vendor from the netherlands, but those guys all have only bulk offers usually so you gotta spend hundreds to get a really good deal, plus shipping from the netherlands or anywhere around their is watched much more closely by customs, meaning a much higher risk of your orders getting caught. As well as it being believe by a decent amount of people that some vendors are selective scammers. So theirs a much higher risk.<br /><br /><br />
