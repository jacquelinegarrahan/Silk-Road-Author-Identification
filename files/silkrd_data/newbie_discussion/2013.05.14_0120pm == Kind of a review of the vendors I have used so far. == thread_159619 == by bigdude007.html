				These are my observations of using the SR so far.&nbsp; I will update as things happen.<br /><br />I heard about the SR from a friend who&#039;d read an article somewhere, at sometime about the dark web.&nbsp; About how there was a place where you could get whatever you&nbsp; wanted, whenever you wanted.&nbsp; The article continued in the vein of how there will be drugged out zombies murdering people in their homes to get access to the internet, I assumed it was the Daily Mail he had been reading.<br /><br />Anyhow the thought of this magical place had piqued my interest and after a bit of searching gained access to this magical place that is SR.<br />I lurked for a week or so, learned the bits and pieces that I needed to before using them for real, fucking bitcoins was the worst. UK access to them is ridiculous.&nbsp; <br /><br />This was all around the time of bitcoins going up to something like £180 = 1 BTC.&nbsp; <br /><br />While I was waiting for the bitcoin to stabilize I started my research, it&#039;s a long time since I had some high quality drugs.&nbsp; The last time I did MDMA it was reasonably good stuff but the last time I had done pills they had been made from pesticide or something (piperazine) and the comedown (if you can call it that, piperazine doesn&#039;t really take you up) was fucking horrible.<br /><br />The thing that had been getting the lions share of my interest was a listing by&nbsp; &quot;MrAnonymousX&quot; for 2 grams of moon rock MDMA. <br />(Here&#039;s the listing http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1b22d921b0) <br />So I started a little research, his stats seemed impressive, top 37%, people were saying the nicest things about him on the forum.&nbsp; <br />(You can read about it here&nbsp; Topic: MrAnonymousX -&quot;This is SUPERB MDMA - Mr.A is my go-to Molly guy&quot; (NOW WORLDWIDE) - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131127.75 )<br />With a title like that I assumed his gear was reasonable, his promise of &quot;Free next day delivery for all UK buyers&quot; was definitely a plus the price seemed extremely good especially from the claims on the product page.&nbsp; These things had definitely helped sway my decision but the forums and what people were saying and the feedback that he was receiving was the main reason.<br />So I placed the order, used PGP for the first time properly and I didn&#039;t get a message back saying WTF! or any others saying that it was incorrect or my address was missing.&nbsp; I have put that into the success side of things.<br />This was all last Wednesday.&nbsp; As of this moment I am still without the order.&nbsp; Had hoped it had got to me for the weekend, but that can&#039;t be helped from this end.<br />I checked MR A&#039;s vendor page to see when I should start chucking him messages about orders that hadn&#039;t arrived, but lack-of-drug anxiety hit and I messaged him. He responded which is a positive as I only managed to hold off 6 of the 14 days required before missing shipments should be brought to his attention.&nbsp; Nothing was really cleared up, but as I say I&#039;m still in the 14 day zone.<br />I shall update as this progresses<br /><br /><br />As I was on the SR I placed another couple of orders.<br />The first was to a vendor of the name &quot;dispater&quot;.<br />Because of being a new user and not having any stats I was required to FE.&nbsp; It&#039;s not really much of a worry to be honest as it&#039;s a relatively small order and if I was a vendor would I risk ripping off a new customer for a small amount?&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t seem that likely, but others may have their own thoughts on that.<br />I asked him a question and the response was within the hour which I consider to be impressive.&nbsp; <br />The only drawback to this transaction so far was having to use privnote as his PGP key had expired. But looking at the privnote system it seems to be secure enough for our back and forth.&nbsp; Again others may have different thoughts about this.<br />I shall update as this progresses<br /><br />The next order was from a vendor called &quot;mrmerlin25&quot;<br />With this order I had to use privnote again, but luckily the transaction with dispater had prepared me for that.<br />With what I ordered you got another for half the price which was a bonus as it was hiding in the postage options and I hadn&#039;t noticed it until the end.<br />I shall update as this progresses<br /><br />Bigdude007<br />

				I ordered from Mr AnonymousX a couple of weeks ago. Nothing arrived and I had to open a Resolve, I requested a 100% refund and he agreed.<br />Hopefully yours will turn up.<br /><br />Personally I wouldn&#039;t use privnote. I&#039;m not entirely tech savvy, but enough people here have expressed concern with how un-secure it is for me to not want to use it. <br /><br />Oh, and Daily Mail? pffft ... Daily Fail, more like.<br /><br /><br />Interesting post, looking forward to the updates. ★

				Cheers for weighing in Android<br />Re: Mr AnonymousX<br />The good news is you got 100% refund. Just a waste of time really &amp; everyone can do without that.&nbsp; <br />Has this happened to anyone else?<br />It was right at the end of the listing, possibly the last of what he had.&nbsp; Although his listings are back up so he must have had a resupply.<br />Hopefully this will be all sorted by this weekend

				Fingers crossed for ya.<br /><br />Tbh, he was very personable and reasonable. He even offered a 2for1 deal next time. I dunno, things do go missing in the post. Maybe I was just unlucky.<br />Like you said, plenty of people have praised his service so I&#039;m not prepared to call foul-play. <br /><br /><br />Are you here for anything other than MDMA? I joined for the LSD - never been able to source the genuine article in the real world.

				Hey all...<br /><br />Re Mr Anonymous...&nbsp; I have ordered from him twice now and had excellent service and quality product both times, the quality is A1+ (had an amazing night on some of the first order...best ive had in years!)..the second order was overweight too.&nbsp; So i&#039;m a fan, think he is a genuine guy. <br /><br />I have also ordered from k queen who have similarly been really good, helpful and fast for K and just recently for MDMA too again they seem totally genuine.<br /><br />I have just ordered some acid from JoR who seem to have a really solid reputation...will see if the quality is as hoped when it arrives.&nbsp; I agree that in the &quot;real&quot; world there is so much shit acid about (or loads of Nbome)<br /><br />Had no real probs with any of the vendors at all... I bought some &quot;ok&quot; MDMA on the gram as a complete newbie a few months back it was not as good as the stuff from Mr A or KQueen but was still better than I have had &quot;on the street&quot;<br /><br />As someone said elsewhere on the forums, SR is great for those of us with proper jobs who are too busy to hang round in shitty flats with kids cooking ket and smoking weed to score a bit ...and want a quality product for a proper nite out<br /><br />peace<br /><br />

				Cheers appreciate the fingers being crossed.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be pretty miffed if it does go awol because it&#039;s my first experience of the road. Wanted it to be this smooth amazing thing but meh.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious about many different chemicals, not one I&#039;m fixated on more or less than another (MDMA excluded).<br />My first LSD experience was from my brother, sold me a fuck load of trips and I over did it, second time I actually scored some in a smart shop in Amsterdam, had 1 in dam.....I do not recommend this if you are on your own!!&nbsp; Brought some home, many good nights, rather than 1 fuckin horrible 300 hour experience.&nbsp; Less is more sometimes<br />LSD could be some fun for the summer.&nbsp; Going up north for holidays so having some transcendental trip in the highlands Ha!<br />That fucking captcha is a nightmare<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159619.msg1126153#msg1126153">Quote from: Stridulate on May 14, 2013, 02:44 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hey all...<br /><br />Re Mr Anonymous...&nbsp; I have ordered from him twice now and had excellent service and quality product both times, the quality is A1+ (had an amazing night on some of the first order...best ive had in years!)..the second order was overweight too.&nbsp; So i&#039;m a fan, think he is a genuine guy. <br />...<br /><br />peace<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what I have seen everywhere and one of the reasons the order was made.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Amen to the too busy, good job unfortunately not in my ideal location.&nbsp; One day

				<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What was the MDMA like?<br />Did you do a reagent testing?<br /><br /><br />I didnt do any reagent testing but the gear was great....<br /><br />Me and 3 mates did just over a gram between us starting with 120mg bombed (about 11pm) and then bumping lines... all of us agreed that we had one of the best nites we have had in a long time&nbsp; :D <br /><br />We were still high as fuck when the sun came up and the comedown was quite gentle considering how strong the roll was!&nbsp; rounded it off with a few bumps of k....nice....bed by mid afternoon!!<br /><br />so no complaints on quality we are all experienced heads and it definitely made the grade!!<br /><br />I always do a little line of any new delivery (weighed 50mg for molly) and this is usually a good guide...both MrA and KQueens gear passed this fine....probably should get a test kit though.<br /><br />Playing out this weekend at a party so will report back on getting proper high (I Hope) on the second batch from MrA <br /><br />I also keep it very quiet where the gear comes from....or the queue would be round the block!!!<br /><br />

				And a good afternoon to you guys<br />Here&#039;s the news, that&#039;s new and approved by me.<br />Got my first order back from and feeling good.&nbsp; It was the order from mrmerlin and it was overnight delivery so well pleased.<br />MrA has got back to me through the messaging system, bit of a cock up his end but has packaged up and sent today with a little extra.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br />Happy about that.&nbsp; Although if I was a little younger and more impatient I would have been climbing the walls.<br />Dispater goods hasn&#039;t been delivered yet, but it was close to cut off point for next day delivery when I got my order in.<br />So it should be set course for a fucked up weekend.

				Excellent news all round then.<br />My interest in 2-cb has been piqued and I think I may have to drop technohippy a line.<br />If I do order from him I&#039;ll drop him a line saying that you referred me Stridulate, you never know he may chuck something extra in for you next order.&nbsp; Can but try.<br />I&#039;ll be doing a little review on here after the weekend so we will be able to compare notes.&nbsp; [quote Have a safe weekend dude.

				Hey...Time to report back, Had a super awesome time with MrA&#039;s latest delivery of MDMA was super clean and our little group had an awesome nite dancing to some great tunes before chillin as the sun came up ;D .&nbsp; Really nice to feel pretty OK today (considering lack of sleep etc.) so as with the last delivery this is excellent, clean proper molly.<br /><br />Was plied with some nice coke from a friend but they had to go a long way to score and were moaning about the price etc.&nbsp; I kept quiet about SR but felt a little bit smug tho!&nbsp; I shared some molly to salve my guilt!<br /><br />Hope others weekends went good too! ;)

				REPORT<br />-----------<br />Fuckin&#039; great<br /><br />That was good.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have any mixers with it until following day, some soma &amp; oxy to come down.&nbsp; Good clean buzz, bombed some and railed some.&nbsp; The drip was fuckin&#039; nasty<br />No real comedown to speak of, I pre-loaded and have been outside in the sun a lot, I&#039;ve had my marmite &amp; horlicks.&nbsp; So that may have helped, but I don&#039;t ever remember it being this easy.<br />Props to MrA and his gear.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m trying on a tester of some Morrocan hash and I think this has been the most difficult post I&#039;ve ever made.&nbsp; So many re-writes and spelling corrections. <br />It&#039;s good hash.&nbsp; Ages since I&#039;ve had resin it&#039;s a nice change from the weed buzz, bit heavier, more gouchy.<br />

				Another order in with Mr Anonymousx, should be here tomorrow.&nbsp; He had no listings up but sent some of his personal stash.....what a vendor.&nbsp; Above and beyond I think that&#039;s called. <br /><br />Another order went in with &quot;dispater&quot; took too long to get the order processed so I&#039;ll be surprised if that lands on my doorstep tomorrow as advertised.

				So the delivery from &quot;Dispater&quot; arrived Saturday, not 24hr but still a quick delivery....here&#039;s the kicker.&nbsp; Bleeding postman posted it next door....and the neighbour didn&#039;t appear until Sunday.&nbsp; I was very sick by then. When I did finally get the gear it was like heaven in a bag.&nbsp; Bang on weight and decent enough.&nbsp; <br />Big thanks to &quot;Dispater&quot;.&nbsp; Will be trying another vendor this time round, nothing personal to Dispater but you have to play the field to see what&#039;s out there.&nbsp; <br />Although is rocks are winking and calling to me....decisions, decisions.
