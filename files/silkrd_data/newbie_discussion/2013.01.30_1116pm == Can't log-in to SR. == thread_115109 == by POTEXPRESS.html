				Hey guys,<br /><br />For some odd reason I can&#039;t log-in to my SR account. It keeps saying my password is incorrect. But I&#039;m 100% sure I type it in correctly. Anyone knows whats up with that? <br /><br />Also, another question.<br /><br />I took a look at the average prices of high quality weed. Since I live in Holland I am able to ship out top quality bud. (Super Silver Haze, Super Lemon Haze, White Widow, etc) My question is, what would you guys pay (in dollars) for a gram of White Widow or Super Silver Haze? I could be cheaper than most sellers out here.

				Doesn&#039;t sound like Silk Road to me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it tells you when your password is wrong, it just says something about an error occurring if memory serves.&nbsp; Make sure you&#039;re at this URL:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion</code><br />As for your weed... once you login, do a search.&nbsp; That&#039;ll answer you.

I&#039;ve been on the Silk Road before. It&#039;s the same link. When I created this new account I was able to get on the site. But after I logged out, I wasn&#039;t able to log-in again. Keeps saying the password is incorrect, while I know 100% sure it is correct. I also created another account, and I had exactly the same problem. <br /><br />I&#039;ve taken a look at the prices like I said before, but I&#039;m just wondering what YOU guys are wanting to pay. Not what sellers are asking. I&#039;ve seen some ridiculous prices that&#039;s why I&#039;m asking.

				If it&#039;s any consolation... I always have difficulty logging on as well.&nbsp; But eventually I get through.<br /><br />What we want to pay for weed?... well as little as possible.&nbsp; Paying nothing would be ideal, please.&nbsp; :)

				I just checked, and it does NOT say you have the wrong password if you enter a bad one.&nbsp; It says &quot;Login failed, please try again.&quot;&nbsp; And I quote.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re on, but it&#039;s not SR -- that or you&#039;re just not being careful enough when asking people to diagnose your problems.<br /><br />P.S. - I hate weed.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t let you pay me to take it, which is why I a) don&#039;t know what it&#039;s worth and b) have no answer of use to you, hence the reason I provided none.<br />
