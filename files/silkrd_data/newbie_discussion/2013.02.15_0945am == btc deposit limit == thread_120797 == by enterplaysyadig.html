				Good question. I also wonder if you can make them back-to-back in one visit. There are quite a few items that cost more than $500.

				If you&#039;re using Bitinstant, then yeah, if you send 2 transactions within a 24 hour period, the 2nd one will usually get stuck due to their fraud filter, and then you have to get them to push it through manually, which sometimes happens quickly and other times takes days for them to respond.

Blockchain doesn&#039;t really explain everything. I know there&#039;s another thread in which somebody explains on how to go through steps like BitInstant to Mt. Gox to SR, but that seems more expensive, timely, and risky. I&#039;d rather go and make one large deposit and put it into my account than go through the bs more often, or using Mt.Gox. Is it better to open these accounts and make transfers from somewhere other than home? Does Blockchain flag you if you&#039;re using Tor? If anybody can answer these questions, I&#039;m sure it would help most newbies.
