				In true, honest fashion, I&#039;m explaining your karma adjustment so you actually know what it&#039;s for.<br /><br />-1 impkin for being a poor loser. You don&#039;t like this site? Simple solution: piss off.<br />+1 sirius for having a bit of goddamn respect. They&#039;re still working on BMR. It&#039;ll improve with time, I&#039;m sure. Just needs a few kinks sorted out and it&#039;ll be as good as rain. <br />-1 galacticnomad for being a galactic troll. I saw your other posts. You do nothing but bitch and complain.<br />-1 discgolfking for being sooooo fucking unconstructive with that comment. What the hell is YOUR solution to spam? Sorry, what? Can you speak up a bit?<br />+1 livestr0ng, again, for being one of the few to not be a dick on the forum and bitch about something the mods have done to try and improve this place. I can respect respect.<br /><br />This is the first day for godsake! Give it time or go home if you don&#039;t like it. I&#039;m sure the mods will constantly work, often thanklessly and for little to no pay, to improve this site for YOU guys. They&#039;re doing this for YOU, not THEMSELVES, and what do you do but complain. The requirement may come down -- or not -- over time as they are sorting it out, just hold off on your trolling. If you don&#039;t, I&#039;ll karma the fuck out of you for every negative comment till you get the message. You have no idea what goes on behind the scene, this is a very stressful time for Silk Road, most of the hard working people here you wouldn&#039;t know about. They don&#039;t do it for acknowledgment, and it&#039;s just as well because they sure don&#039;t get it. Some mods are in stealth mode for instance, and some aren&#039;t even mods but work in Security fixing YOUR problems. And then there are the spam busters.<br /><br />If you want to help, just hold off on the fucking negative and ungrateful attitudes because the majority of you are starting to piss me off, and generally that is not such a great thing for you to do.<br /><br />I&#039;m just kissing anyone&#039;s ass here. But you have no fucking clue what goes on here. We&#039;re happy to help you out getting set up. But going off what has been posted here, quite frankly I&#039;m a lot less likely after today to give a shit about your problems.<br /><br />Have a great fucking day.<br /><br /><br />@ John F Kennedy: This helps stick one up the behind of would-be scammers. I can&#039;t remember BMR&#039;s account fee, but it is peanuts. It&#039;s either $10, or 10 bitcoins (about 140?). This means it is a lot harder for someone to start up at SR, scam, and leave, only to do it in a continual cycle like what used to happen at BMR. This way, you have to stick it out a little. If you do that, then you will be well compensated.

The idea of having to generate a bunch of meaningless posts just to clear a hurdle is a bit annoying, but I totally understand the concept. That&#039;s why I started a thread to generate alternative ideas that could actually help build the site while still accomplishing the same thing.&nbsp; As for my post about DPR laughing his ass off, come on - he&#039;s gotta be smiling, and the image of us newbs scuttling around the deck of a ship is just fucking funny, no disrespect intended to DPR or anyone else. Furthermore, I have a great deal of humility and knowingly accept my role as a lice-infested newb. I have no problems with that. Honestly, I just think you misunderstood me and were quick to the draw on the -1 karma, but whatever.

				Lol, frankly, DPR is a genius for doing this. <br /><br />What I fantasize about though, is that the coders he hired to design SR left backdoors and weren&#039;t the most professional and left vulnerabilities... if TOR wasn&#039;t so slow, I&#039;d look for deeper holes, but the one I&#039;m sitting on now is pretty comfy. <br /><br />You guys know if there&#039;s a way to contact him personally to let him know of a SQL injection in his code?

If you&#039;re not a vendor, you shouldn&#039;t really give a damn because you can still buy drugs which by far your top priority. You&#039;re a customer who cops don&#039;t really give a damn about most of the time. Additionally, we get sick of newbies asking questions that have been answered 1000 times. UTFSE. I&#039;m not going to explain that because if you don&#039;t know what it means, you should UTFSE, or in other words, common sense. If you&#039;re a vendor, every post you make advertises yourself and your products if you set up your posts correctly. Posting 50 times in one or two days is boring and annoying, but an effective and helpful strategy for all of us. Get over it. <br /><br />As for DPR, this place would not kick so much ass if his ideas were dumb. It takes a lot of damn good thinking and work to get a place like this as good as it is. I&#039;m not going to kiss his ass every post, but he/she/it does a damn good job in my opinion, all things considered.

				I&#039;m pretty sure some vendor said they could post on the regular site, and then another vendor said he couldn&#039;t. I don&#039;t know. Making newbies post 50 times to get on to the main foruns is a lttle frustration, but I too, don&#039;y understand comments like that. I was annotyed that the very first day this policy was implemented the trolling commenced. <br /><br />Whether this is totally effective is not the issue. The issue is, a little curtesy would not go astray. I tire of the comments like, &quot;DPR is a dick&quot; or &quot;THis is a shit idea&quot; or &quot;This doesn&#039;t stop spamming.&quot; I think this idea is a work in progress. And the spam was actually working until today.<br /><br />Rome wasn&#039;t built in a day.

				I don&#039;t get that frustration from the newbie users. They can read in the main forum, they can use the search function and in case there is anything that isn&#039;t answered there is the possibility of writing a PM.<br />On the other hand that some vendors, who can&#039;t access there own vendor threads are pissed is understandable but that&#039;s something the Mods can change.<br /><br />Peace Over-

				about among other things: thank you DPR for the opportunity to safely acquire different substances. This is really a breakthrough in trade. Sure, this was the beginning for the legalization of &quot;drug&quot; in the whole world!<br /><br /><br /><br />про между прочим: спасибо DPR за предоставленную возможность безопасно приобретать разные вещества. Это действительно прорыв в торговле. Уверен, это положило начало для легализации &quot;наркотиков&quot; во всём мире!

				The thing that concerns me with the 50 count requirement is if something terrible happens and someone has to make a throw-away account to warn the forums of impending doom, they will have to post on the newbie forums. Their post will be buried beneath all this spam and will not be seen by the massess like it would be in silk road discussion.
