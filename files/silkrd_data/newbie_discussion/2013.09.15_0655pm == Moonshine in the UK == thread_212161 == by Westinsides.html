				Does anyone currently produce Moonshine that is deliverable to the UK? My mate had some last year and it was awesome stuff. Would be great for a person to set up that knows what he is doing. Could have a whole product range. I think it would be really popular....what do you think?

				Yeah booze is too expensive. As long as we don&#039;t get methanol poisoning it&#039;s all good ;)

				There&#039;s always GBL for cheapness and similar effects. I guess it&#039;s not really a true replacement for booze though.

				Nah no where near the same. Would be great if someone could get thier hands on:<br /><br />Jack Daniels<br />Smirmoff Vodka<br />Danzka Vodka<br />Belvedere Vodka<br />Grey Goose Vodka<br /><br />I would buy every week if the price was right. Someone out there must have access to these products.<br /><br />Back to the first comment though, nothing would beat a nice decent batch of home-made moonshine!

It&#039;s fairly hard to conceal and hide a big vodka or such bottle.<br />~D

				I do get your point but literally thousands of bottles are posted around the UK every single day. What is suspicious about a bottle of booze or even a crate of bottles?<br /><br />They don&#039;t know we got them for a knocked off price....

				I am unsure of the laws of sending alcohol, but as with cigarettes they are often seized and you are required to pay the tax you avoided for them.<br />I expect there is a big difference, I wouldn&#039;t know too well, I suppose vendors just don&#039;t see it being a profitable business.<br />~D

				Alcohol is not considered a prohibited item by royal mail aslong as it is under 70%ABV but how are they going to check..<br /><br />So there would be no problems with domestic postage, maybe just importing.<br /><br /><br />
