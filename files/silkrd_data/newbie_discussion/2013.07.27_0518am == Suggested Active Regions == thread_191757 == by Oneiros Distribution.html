				As I mentioned in one of my older posts in the thread Re: Home country - who uses this ?: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186488.msg1366575#msg1366575 this will be a thread explaining what Regions should be Active in my opinion and why. This thread will base itself on the data in the thread Home Country Setting on Silk Road: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171551 - Silk Road currently has 245 regions while the ISO 3166-1 standard has 249 regions. I will be basing my new suggested list on the ISO 3166-1 standard with 249 regions with the added change of &quot;Viet Nam&quot; being spelled as &quot;Vietnam&quot;.<br /><br />The new Suggested Active Regions will if nothing else be used by me in my Concept/Intelligence/Project Threads as I&#039;ll be able to exclude lot&#039;s of irrelevant Regions. I will exclude all regions with less than 1,000,000 in total population unless it has a valid exception to be on the list. Regions who fulfill the population requirement might be excluded on the basis of instability, it will be mentioned when that is the case. Refined versions of the Removed/Active Regions will be further down.<br /><br />Afghanistan: Remove, population 30,419,928 is sufficient but region is too unstable.<br />Åland Islands: Remove, population 28,355 is too low.<br />Albania: Keep, population 2,821,977 is high enough.<br />Algeria: Keep, population 37,900,000 is high enough.<br />American Samoa: Remove, population 55,519 is too low.<br />Andorra: Remove, population 85,082 is too low.<br />Angola: Keep, population 18,498,000 is high enough.<br />Anguilla: Remove, population 13,600 is too low.<br />Antarctica: Remove, no permanent population and not very likely to be used ever.&nbsp; :P<br />Antigua and Barbuda: Remove, population 81,799 is too low.<br />Argentina: Keep, population 41,660,417 is high enough.<br />Armenia: Keep, population 3,262,200 is high enough.<br />Aruba: Remove, population 102,484 is too low.<br />Australia: Keep, population 23,097,337 is high enough.<br />Austria: Keep, population 8,414,638 is high enough.<br />Azerbaijan: Keep, population 9,356,500 is high enough.<br />Bahamas: Remove, population 353,658 is too low.<br />Bahrain: Keep, population 1,234,571 is high enough.<br />Bangladesh: Keep, population 150,039,000 is high enough.<br />Barbados: Remove, population 274,200 is too low.<br />Belarus: Keep, population 9,457,500 is high enough.<br />Belgium: Keep, population 11,035,948 is high enough.<br />Belize: Remove, population 327,719 is too low.<br />Benin: Keep, population 9,598,787 is high enough.<br />Bermuda: Remove, population 64,268 is too low.<br />Bhutan: Remove, population 742,737 is too low.<br />Bolivia, Plurinational State of: Keep, population 10,389,913 is high enough.<br />Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba: Remove, population 21,133 is too low.<br />Bosnia and Herzegovina: Keep, population 3,839,737 is high enough.<br />Botswana: Keep, population 2,029,307 is high enough.<br />Bouvet Island: Remove, uninhabited subantarctic volcanic island with no population.<br />Brazil: Keep, population 193,946,886 is high enough.<br />British Indian Ocean Territory: Remove, population 3,000 is too low.<br />Brunei Darussalam: Remove, population 408,786 is too low.<br />Bulgaria: Keep, population 7,364,570 is high enough.<br />Burkina Faso: Keep, population 15,730,977 is high enough.<br />Burundi: Keep, population 8,749,000 is high enough.<br />Cambodia: Keep, population 14,952,665 is high enough.<br />Cameroon: Keep, population 19,406,100 is high enough.<br />Canada: Keep, population 33,476,688 is high enough.<br />Cape Verde: Remove, population 499,000 is too low.<br />Cayman Islands: Remove, population 56,732 is too low<br />Central African Republic: Keep, population 4,422,000 is high enough.<br />Chad: Keep, population 10,329,208 is high enough.<br />Chile: Keep, population 17,402,630 is high enough.<br />China: Keep, population 1,353,821,000 is high enough.<br />Christmas Island: Remove, population 2,072 is too low.<br />Cocos (Keeling) Islands: Remove, population 596 is too low.<br />Colombia: Keep, population 47,072,915 is high enough.<br />Comoros: Remove, population 798,000 is too low.<br />Congo: Keep, population 4,366,266 is high enough.<br />Congo, the Democratic Republic of the: Keep, population 75,507,308 is high enough.<br />Cook Islands: Remove, population 19,569 is too low.<br />Costa Rica: Remove, population 4,586,353 is high enough.<br />Côte d&#039;Ivoire: Keep, population 20,617,068 is high enough.<br />Croatia: Keep, population 4,284,889 is high enough.<br />Cuba: Keep, population 11,163,934 is high enough.<br />Curaçao: Remove, population 142,180 is too low.<br />Cyprus: Keep, population 1,117,000 is high enough.<br />Czech Republic: Keep, population 10,513,209 is high enough.<br />Denmark: Keep, population 5,602,536 is high enough.<br />Djibouti: Remove, population 792,198 is too low.<br />Dominica: Remove, population 72,660 is too low.<br />Dominican Republic: Keep, population 9,445,281 is high enough.<br />Ecuador: Keep, population 15,223,680 is high enough.
