				Hi all, I ordered from N1NJ4 PR0 for the first time.&nbsp; He had a bunch of listings, and after I purchased from him $120, a day later he has no listings, his account page is still there, he has a 100% rating, it says that he hasn&#039;t been on for 7days which is how long ago I ordered, I know its not that long of a time frame to worry, but thats me I guess...and btw I never finalized early or anything, but I did send him a general message a few days ago without a reply...just wondering from any of the veterans, or anyone thats ordered from him if I should be worried yet or give it another week or so...how long should I wait before I cancel my order...I just don&#039;t want to get screwed out of my 1btc.&nbsp; Thanks in advance ppl.&nbsp; Oh yeah one more thing, it still says processing in my order details fyi.

				as long as you stay in escrow you arn&#039;t at risk for loosing your btc. worst case you cancel and get your money back. kind of a bad first impression on his part but sometimes things come up and people have to temporally shut down shop for whatever reasons. maybe wait a couple more days to see if he appears online again to message him and if not cancel and buy from someone else. waiting 10 days for processing is plenty of time imo and i don&#039;t think it would be wrong at that point to take your business elsewhere.<br />good luck

				Thanks for the input...yeah I was thinking the same thing on the first impressions....I have ordered a few other things from other people with no problem and it went from processing to shipping within a few days if not that same day.&nbsp; I placed the order on 5/12 and figured it should have shipped by now.&nbsp; What a hassle, thats going to screw up my time frame lol.&nbsp;
