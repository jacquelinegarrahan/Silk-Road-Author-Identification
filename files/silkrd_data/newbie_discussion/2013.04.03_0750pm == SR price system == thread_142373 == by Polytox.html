				Title: <strong>SR price system</strong><br />

				Hello guys<br />This is my first day on the SR forum and one of my first stumbling through SR so please dont be too mean if i understood something wrong. As you may (or may not :-) ) notice while reading this text, my native language is not english but im trying my best to make myself clear.<br />still learning&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Id like to post this in the real forum, but because i dont see the point in spamming and i cant write 50 sensefull comments that fast ill just post it here (hopefully somebody will read it anyway^^)<br /><br />Now to the actual cause of this threat.<br />As i understood SR, the Vendors set a price for their product in BTC. This price stays the same until the vendor decides to delete the offer and make a new one with a new price ( or is it possible to change the price for a product?).&nbsp; That all be perfectly fine if we would pay in a stable currency, but this is not the case with BTC as we all know. This leads to extreme fast rising prices on SR. The price of one BTC almost quadrupled in one MONTH :o . Even if i just look at yesterdays stats I see an increase of nearly 18% a day. This means, that the product prices on SR did the same. I guess with everything being more and more expensive the purchases drop. So the vendors have to delete the old price and set a new one to keep the market flowing. And with 18% a day, Vendors could probably update the prices every hour. Wouldnt it be far more easy for buyers and vendors, if the SR prices where set in USD or EUR and just the payment process would bring the BTC in the up2date BTC/USD value? I would see all prices in $ or â‚¬ and if i want to buy something SR calculates the present BTC price witch i will pay then. <br />At this point i cant think of any method to keep the BTC/USD course accurate. Maybe the average of the last 24H + some small amount (in set BTC or in % of the price) so that the vendor gets the price he would be payed at the open market. Eventually someone with a brighter mind than me has a better idea for the implementation of my idea :)<br />I think i am not the only one who thinks this is a problem with a solution have to be found. <br /><br />I hope you understood what i tried to say here.<br />Please let me know what you think. Why do you think this is (or not) possible. Maybe someone even knows a much better way to keep the value (not the price) of the products on SR more constant. Eventually this is all just big bullshit or just technicallly not possible or even a wanted effect. If I just understood the whole BTC SR thing wrong please just explain it to me and this topic can be closed.<br /><br />Hoping for a nice discussion&nbsp; :)<br />Greez Polytox

				The price the vendors set are to the USD, so as BTC go up you need to spend less BTC to purchase, if you watch the vendor listings for a few days you will see the cost in BTC lower for the listing as the actual BTC price rises.&nbsp; Hope that makes sense.
