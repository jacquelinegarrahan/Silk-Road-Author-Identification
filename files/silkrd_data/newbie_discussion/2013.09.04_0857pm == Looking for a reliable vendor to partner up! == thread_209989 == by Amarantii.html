				Hello!<br /><br />Forgive me if this is against the rules or something but I&#039;m in a tight situation right now. I&#039;m a college student and just started my second year. The problem is that I wasn&#039;t eligible for a loan since I was stupid enough to practically never study which made me fail a lot of courses and thus didn&#039;t meet the criteria to be accepted for a loan. It&#039;s really hard to make ends meet so I was thinking of becoming a vendor on SR but I don&#039;t have much to offer and can&#039;t afford the fee for becoming a vendor. I don&#039;t expect this to generate much cash for me but every buck I earn on the side will make it a little easier in brutal economic times like this.<br /><br />The only thing I can offer is a GREAT GUIDE to drastically improve your memory. It&#039;s a 30-day guide with audio files and it is very detailed and explained so clearly. You will learn numerous techniques to store things in your brain which you need to remember. It is very straightforward and really easy to learn. Information will be stored in your brain even after only hearing/reading it once! It will be stored for a long time and you can easily retrieve information which you need to remember when the occasion calls for it. After 30 days you will learn how to memorize a 20-digit number by only hearing the numbers once and you&#039;ll be able to repeat the numbers forwards, backwards, by skipping every other number etc etc. The information will be stored in your brain and is easily retrievable. By enhancing your memory you will be able to remember names, cellphone numbers, shopping lists and even holding an entire lecture without any notes. It works on so many levels and your life will surely benefit from it.<br /><br />If I can find a trustworthy vendor to sell this awesome product for me it would help me out a lot! I was hoping that a trustworthy vendor can contact me and we shall discuss this further in detail. I will send all the audio files from the memory-training course so you can skim through it and come with opinions. There&#039;s an audio file for each day. They aren&#039;t very long, like 10 minutes each. You can listen through Day 2, 3 or 4 and try the techniques yourself. You will be pleasantly surprised how much better you&#039;ll remember things. After I&#039;ve sent you the audio files you&#039;ll have to decide whether this is a product you&#039;d be willing to sell for me and if yes, we shall come to an agreement on the price and how we shall split the earnings.<br /><br />Regards...

				Why not start a legitimate business from this if you think it will be successful? A little landing page site, with some SEO, a free newsletter, etc you could be making some cash off of an idea like this.

A little landing page site, with some SEO, a free newsletter, etc you could be making some cash off of an idea like this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Those are all great ways to make money but I have tried all of that. I simply don&#039;t have the willpower to put effort into something like this. I&#039;m just a person who gives up easily, that&#039;s why I fail many of my college courses. But trust me, I have tried every way imaginable to make money online. I even spent a month clicking on ads for pennies! You see, if I can find a vendor to partner up with, this vendor probably already has a base of returning customers who are curious to see what new products he has to offer. A vendor like that wouldn&#039;t have a problem selling this product because he has a good rating, many loyal customers and a name that screams out &quot;trustworthy&quot;. People wouldn&#039;t mind purchasing things from a vendor like this and the customers would love the product.<br /><br />So yeah, you could say that I&#039;m trying to leech off the success of a vendor but that really isn&#039;t the case. I just want to partner up with someone who will get this product for free, try it out before putting it out for sale and hopefully we will both make a decent extra income from this little adventure. I don&#039;t want to get rich from this, a few bitcoins a month would do it for me to cover some expenses.<br /><br />So please, if a vendor is willing to partner up with me and is willing to try this product for free, contact me asap!<br /><br /><br />Edit: If some of you think I&#039;m just a troll or simply joking around. I&#039;m not lol. I just finished organizing all the audio files and it&#039;s ready to be shipped out to the first trustworthy vendor who contacts me :)<br /><br />Edit 2: If some of you vendors are wondering, I&#039;d say this product is worth 0.3 - 0.4 bitcoins. And obviously it&#039;s digital so no fiddling around with shipping and packaging. So yeah, we won&#039;t get super rich off of this venture but anything that helps me earn some bitcoins would be a blessing from above.

				Send me a PM if you&#039;re willing to partner with someone who has experience and the willpower to run an SEO campaign like that. I&#039;d be willing to give it a shot. Worst thing that happens is it fails.

Hehehe. But it works! Tried it myself. Always fun to ask a family member to write down 20 - 25 numbers and read them out loud once, and I will repeat the numbers in the correct order both forwards and backwards. ;D
