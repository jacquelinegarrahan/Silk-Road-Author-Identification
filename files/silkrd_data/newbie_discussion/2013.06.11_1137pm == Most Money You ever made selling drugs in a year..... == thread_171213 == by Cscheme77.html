What &quot;rules&quot; did you set yourself? How did you get such a good markup? Tips/stories etc?

				LOL This is a funny thread. <br /><br />Ill throw my hat in the ring, Ive made as little as $100 a month and as much as 100k in the same time. Some times business was bad, some times good, and some times FUCKING GREAT. <br /><br />&nbsp;I am currently FLAT BROKE, working like a dog for a living , 2 jobs. Moral here is. Selling drugs only pays off when you dont acutally NEED to do it...orr, never quit your day job, drug dealer or not.

				I don&#039;t know...<br /><br />I&#039;m calling bullshit on OP.<br /><br />You would have to move an incredible volume with huge markups...a revolving 24/7 door that did not get noticed by LE.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, it is possible, but without any real details I am very skeptical.&nbsp;

				This was during Katrina everything in my city was marked up 3 to 4 times normal and I would make trips to get what i needed and sell only to buyers(no dealers). I also sold DVDs and BBQ plates to account for my traffic....True story
