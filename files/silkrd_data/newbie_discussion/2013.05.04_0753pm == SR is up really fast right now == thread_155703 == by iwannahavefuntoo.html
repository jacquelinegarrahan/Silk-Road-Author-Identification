				SR is up really fast right now... for now...<br /><br />DISABLE IMAGES before logging in. Save bandwidth, do not load all of those images on the main page. DPR should just turn that off for now anyway. It will save bandwidth.

				bandwidth is not the biggest problem but connection counts are. read my post here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0 raising your &#039;keep-alive&#039; timeout will lock your connection in better. and please, please, seriously consider running a non-exit relay on your connection. if we all add some capacity to the tor network (you would not believe how little it&#039;s grown in node count since 6 years ago, only 50%) this will widen the channel and increase the cost of the attack, as well as increasing the odds of peple getting on there.<br /><br />i have finally gotten in after being stuck unable to get in all day. i have a 1 hour keepalive timeout. that is a connection the attacker can&#039;t use, even though i am only using that connection for normal, low demand use.<br /><br />there is other measures that will need to be taken and i have mostly laid out all the short term actions that need to be taken, i hope that mods are reading my posts and seeing the sense of it.

				Connection counts matter as well, disabling images will reduce connection counts (firefox will use up to 4 to the same server I think), and increasing keep-alive like you suggested would keep the one good connection open.

				https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=networksize&amp;start=2006-02-03&amp;end=2013-05-04#networksize<br /><br />ok, so my estimate was a bit wrong. tor network capacity in terms of tor nodes has doubled. IN SEVEN YEARS. ok? this is why SR is so slow. if every SR user ran even a 256kbit (shaped ADSL speed) relay, that number would move sharply up to 3500-4000. that would massively increase availability of SR.

				n/m about the images. I just noticed that the site is using base64 inline encoded images. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a recent change or not. I&#039;m pretty sure it is, and it&#039;s a very good idea.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0<br /><br />I just want to encourage everyone who can, to run a non-exit tor relay. But as I have discovered, raising the HTTP keep-alive timeout helps with the connection, because what it does is keep the connection to the server open instead of closing it and making a new one. This isn&#039;t important for clearnet sites so much, in fact it can be counterproductive, but for tor hidden services, which have much higher latency, and a higher cost of time and processing in establishing new connections (your tor client has to query the tor hidden service introducer node database every time it makes a new connection) it makes sense to reuse connections for hidden services rather than make new ones all the time. It does not have any significant disadvantage for the server itself, although it does lock up one connection per user that can&#039;t be recycled quickly, that is also a connection that can&#039;t be shuttered by a DoS attacker.

				I&#039;ll go ahead and set up a non-exit relay on my 30/30 fibre connection, hopefully that will be of help :)
