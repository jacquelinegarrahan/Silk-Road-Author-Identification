				Hello everyone,<br />I registered here this morning and have been surfing on this webside for this whole day now and i must admit that i am pretty damn impressed! This is bar far the best version of ebay that I&#039;ve ever seen, BUT... just like everyone else, I&#039;m of course careful too so I&#039;ve been checking out all kinds of security stuff and I found a ton too but its all in &quot;computer language&quot;... I read that you need to use PGP and encrypt your stuff and I tried to understand all this stuff but to be honest, I don&#039;t have clue what I need to do to order safely.. So if anyone could tell me the basics what I need to do before I make my first purchase it&#039;d be really nice. And also, I don&#039;t really get this payment system here... How do I buy those bitcoins and use them for my silk road account? So a little &quot; How to use silk road the first time&quot; would be really nice and especially if you could really tell me what to do, not just &quot;get PGP&quot; or whatever because I don&#039;t have a clue what that is..<br />And by the way If anyone is from Germany and knows what you could put as an address and name and be safe that would be helpful too because I&#039;ve no clue where I could send it and what name to use.<br />Thanks in advance<br />

				Have you read the wiki?<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />It should bring you up to speed quickly.

				I would definitely keep reading the forums as much as possible. Use the search feature to look up anything and everything about security, shipping, stealth, drug safety, etc. When you think you finally have a grasp on everything, read a little more. Then figure out how to put bitcoins in your account and order. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t place my first order until 3 weeks after I first made my account. I read these forums for at least 2-3 hours a day after work. This is not a place to half-ass it. Serious consequences wait for people who rush into it too quickly.
