				So I&#039;m going to order from the road pretty soon and was wondering what is consider the norm for your shipping information.&nbsp; Should I use my real name or an alias?&nbsp; I live in an apartment and we still receive mail for past residents, should I use one of those names? What about a slight misspelling of my real name (only changing the last letter of my first name)? Being a newbie, im pretty sketched out about giving my real name...

				I have yet to order myself but here are some things I have to add to the discussion as newbie myself.<br /><br />My first order is going to be from a verified good vendor (One who has been around awhile and has good reviews). Some people I think right now who fall into that category are UndergroundSyndicate, Mushroomgirl, polygamuz, googleeyed. Just depends on what you want.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry about using real information with any vendor because they don&#039;t know if its real or not and in most cases probably don&#039;t care, just trying to make a buck. <br /><br />If you use another persons mailing name and address and they set up a forwarding address for any amount of time, your package will be their package.<br /><br />Misspelling? I am not convinced that mail people give enough shits to do much else then make sure mail for address X ends up in the mailbox for address X (and even then, 4/10 times that seems like a struggle).<br /><br />Alias? Depends on how rigorous your delivery people are. If they are rural carriers, expect them to know more about your address then if they are metropolis deliverers.<br /><br />In the end the quickest way to get product to you would be use your name, and your address, and sit back and wait.<br /><br />The more hands it touches the more chance the package becomes intercepted.

				The usual advice is to use your real name.<br /><br />If you use a previous tenant&#039;s name, what happens to the package if it is too big to fit in your mailbox? Or requires a signature? It could be a red-flag if you go to pick up a previous tenant&#039;s package.

				Thanks for the advice. Also, I thought that you should never sign for packages that contain drugs to avoid incrimination if something happens.&nbsp; Do many sellers require for packages to be signed?

				Never use your real name.<br />First line of denibility<br />Use a previous tenants who cleary isnt having mail forwarded.<br />Always order small amounts ie will fit in your mail box.<br />Altho a newb posting wise I&#039;ve been on the road &gt;year.<br /><br />And yes name address is encrypted

				I use real name and address.&nbsp; The idea is that my one piece of mail should not stand out among the millions of other daily items handled by USPS.<br /><br />I always create a text file to hold my address info and paste a copy of my public key at the bottom of the message.&nbsp; Encrypt that text file and paste into sr address box.<br /><br />I may just be lucky but I have received every order with no issue over the past year and a half.&nbsp; I do spend a lot of time reading forums for general opinions and reviews of vendors prior to ordering.<br /><br />

				The mail received under past residents is usually junk mail, would this still be delivered to my address if they were forwarding their mail? People seem to have conflicting reports about this, any extra input would be appreciated

I can go online and mail you anything I want. <br /><br />This is why investigating a &quot;small user&quot; package if it was seized isn&#039;t worth their time because of the man hours to PROVE that you had those things shipped to you.<br /><br />I said this in my prior post but I feel like it is useful again. If you live in a rural area or a small town, your postal carrier is more likely to know what is going on at each house. Bigger metro areas? You most likely get mail from houses all over the neighborhood because fuck if those guys can even land a sack of mail in the right slots one day out of the month, there is just so much mail.<br /><br />It is up to you how much risk you are willing to take and honestly ordering carries very little risk when done in proper sizes and with proper well vetted vendors.<br /><br />Drugs were being sent in the mail before SR, they will be sent in the mail long after SR. This place just simplifies the process of finding what you want.<br /><br />You do need to find your comfort level with sending your details to someone and remember that for the most part these vendors should be deleting all information after the transaction is complete. They don&#039;t know if the info you put in those boxes is true, and as long as the BTC flows in, probably don&#039;t care.

				i used a fake name but my real address for my first order so we&#039;ll see how it goes. fingers crossed. the vendor sends via regular mail, which in Aust, doesnt require a signiture or ID etc. I didn&#039;t send my address to him using PGP cos im still trying to figure that out as we speak. PGP Newb forums are offering some help. does anyone know of any really good video tutorial links that i could find to take me through the whole process for PGP. i&#039;m pretty sure im almost there, but im probably missing one stupid little step. any help at all would be awesome. cheers.

				the only time i have ever thought about using a fake name would be with a brand new vendor. i usually wait til they are a month old and have a few sales under their belt. but even then i will only order a small amount from them at first until i see alot of people ordering big from them. i really hate replacing my oak door.<br />&nbsp;if they are a really established and well known vendor then feel free to give them ur real name. they are more worried about u being a cop and attempting to investigate them.

				Real name if you&#039;re getting it sent to your own home. <br /><br />Kinda&#039; looks suspicious if the delivery guy sees a package addressed to someone at a house he has never seen before.<br /><br />It probably doesn&#039;t matter that much, but I&#039;ve always used my real name.

				I wouldn&#039;t use a friend&#039;s name and address.&nbsp; You&#039;re putting them at risk.&nbsp; If they understand and are willing to accept the risk, then it&#039;s not as much of an issue but still not something I would do.&nbsp; I would just feel like I was deferring responsibility and consequences for my decisions onto someone I consider a friend.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t feel right to me, even if I give them some of whatever I&#039;m ordering as a sort of payment.&nbsp; A couple hits of acid or half a gram of molly is not enough to outweigh the potential years in court systems and legal costs.<br /><br />I always use my actual information.&nbsp; But I never keep anything illegal at this address.&nbsp; When that package shows up, it contains the only illegal thing in my apartment and I immediately write &quot;return to sender&quot; on it in case anyone comes knocking.&nbsp; And if something feels off, don&#039;t ever accept that package.&nbsp; Go with your gut instincts when the package is being delivered on whether or not the deliverer knows the contents.
