				My forum account is new but only because I could not for my life remember my full member password. Since Bitcoins have become a huge hassle to obtain, I decided to look for a SR vendor selling coin for Greendot MoneyPaks since I had gone that route before. I found CryptoKeeper listing BTC for various reload cards like Greendot, Vanilla, etc.. I have been on SR for a long time now, before you could upload product pictures and I have only been scammed 2 times, luckily for small amounts of $. So I like to think I can sniff out a scam. Because of the nature of a transaction like this, I figured my chances were good because when I searched the forums I only found people speculating that CryptoKeeper might be a scammer. I saw several posts indicating that some transactions with CK fell through, but that he did not take their money and run even though they had sent him their reload codes. This made me feel confident that CryptoKeeper is running a legit operation, so I ran around the corner, got a Greendot pak and placed an order. I was hoping to have the coin earlier today, but everybody here wants instant gratification and things just don&#039;t work like that. Long story short, a little over 24 hours later, the BTC were in my account and the fee he charges isn&#039;t outrageous. I just want to let everyone know from a seasoned SR buyer with literally hundreds of orders and not one non-delivery, just my 2 small FE hits from good vendors gone rogue, that CryptoKeeper is legit and safe to order from. His feedback could have been padded and he easily could have taken my money and ran but thankfully that is not the case. Cryptokeeper is running a legit operation and is NOT a scammer.<br /><br />I suspect that the transaction would have been a bit faster if I used another reload card like Vanilla instead of Greendot because after searching around I found out that Greendot places a limit on how much $ or how many transactions one person can do in a day, but I knew I could get Greendot and didn&#039;t want to bother finding another brand of reload card. So if I am correct you would probably get faster service using a Vanilla or other reload card. I also see that he pulled his Greendot listings (maybe temporary but I&#039;m not sure) but left up his other listings so I think I am correct about Greendot being the bottleneck. Bottom line is that CryptoKeeper really came through for me and I wanted to say that any mention of him possibly being a scammer are purely speculation.<br /><br />Thank you CK!

				Just get rid of him...he&#039;s been scamming on here for quite some time...I&#039;ve never been scammed by him (Knew better), but I know many people who have messaged me saying that he has.<br /><br />His feedback is laughable, his 0% commission is also laughable.<br /><br />Admins, please ban this guy so these newbies stop getting scammed by him.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Anyone have any actual evidence that they have been taken for the $ by CK?&nbsp; All I have really found is people saying that he is a scammer but his reviews don&#039;t reflect that and I have heard that he has come through in the past.&nbsp; I guess he could be baiting people in with a low rate, earning their trust then beating them when they put down a big deposit, but I would think that admins would have banned him by now if that was the case.&nbsp; Plus not to talk shit but anyone who is just talking him up or down could easily be a friend or competitor with higher rates.

				Or the more likely scenario is that he is a selective scammer. Being out over $300 with the dick, I suggest using caution.
