				I&#039;m new to SR, but not to drugs. I&#039;m no kid, been there, done that.. got the t-shirt. But when I discovered this place I was totally amazed. What an awesome place, awesome community and this is exactly what the world needs. If governments don&#039;t understand that we are human, we deserve to enjoy OUR lives the way we want to. I hate how a person can be a regular pot head in high school and one day become president..it obviously did not hurt him or his future. But then have the audacity to say its bad and nobody else should do it. Stay strong SR!!!

				I agree. I&#039;m only 2 purchases in but both are well above the standard local fair and while slightly more expensive we don&#039;t have to drive to the hood to obtain, or worry about driving around with a felony in the vehicle. Granted transportation from the safehouses is risky but they aren&#039;t in drug hoods.<br /><br />Major props to all the legit vendors, especially those who are honest in their descriptions.

				SR has even proven to be quite cost-efficient for me. I live far away from my dealers, and taking gas/time into account, it easily pays off using this site :)

				This place has changed my life for the better. I never would&#039;ve been able to have the experiences I did without SR. And I&#039;ve also learned so much from the people on this forum about a wide variety of topics. Long live SR!!

				SR is an interesting paradigm for me. Once I had access to all it&#039;s glory, I actually became very conservative in purchasing.&nbsp; I have spend most of my life learning all things computing, across different disciplines, so the whole practice of the concept is also endlessly entertaining and informative for me. <br /><br />Also, street level purchases are a thing of the past, thank god.
