				1.&nbsp; Establish a legitimate income base sufficient for &#039;tinkering&#039; or making small investments.<br />2.&nbsp; Become an ordained minister ($60 from any number of online ministries)<br />3.&nbsp; Find a down and out handy man with a drug issue.&nbsp; (make him a sweatheart deal and watch him like a hawk).&nbsp; He will be referred to as #2<br />4.&nbsp; Buy a fixer-upper for under 15k.&nbsp; Must have 2 bathrooms and at least 3 bedroooms.&nbsp; <br />5.&nbsp; Use religious title to apply for grants to fund the opening of your half-way house.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Encourage #2 to seek out a #3 from his residents.<br />7.&nbsp; Accept weekly rent from tenets (should be in excess of $1200 per house) and ensure that&nbsp; any tenants that make the track back to drugs&nbsp; are buying from #3.&nbsp; #3 should be on a hair thin probation and entirely at the mercy of #2.&nbsp; <br />8.&nbsp; #2&#039;s other job is to fix the place up to increase its equity which he has a vested interest in.&nbsp; When it sells #2 and #1 make money and then on to the next place.&nbsp; <br />9.&nbsp; The pyramid might expand to to include multiple locations for male houses / female houses or align to service specific vices with the potential for inter-house commerce.&nbsp; <br /><br />All mail can be directed to these locations (to a locked mailbox to be picked up by #2 or #3) with complete deniablility by the &#039;Owner&#039;&nbsp; which will be hopelessly intertwined with the past records of the clientele involved.&nbsp; With SR it becomes possible to service the needs of your half way house resident regardless of how obscure they&#039;re substance of choice may be.&nbsp; At this point #1 is fully insulated but should strive for good karma.&nbsp; Let those who want to better themselves do so but profit off the low-lifes in every possible way (it is absolutely certain that somebody will).<br /><br /><br />
