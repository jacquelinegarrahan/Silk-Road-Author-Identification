				as the scale might look as a bomb in x-ray...<br /><br />is it critical to travel with a digital scale in checked luggage? would it be better to have it in carry-on to give reason?<br /><br /><br />

				Scales are not illegal, so i don&#039;t understand the problem, they scan it, and if it is as wild as your imagination suggests and they suspect its a bomb they open your luggage and find some scales.

				I don&#039;t think you would have any problem with digital scales going through an airport (as long as there not coated in illicit substances lol)<br /><br />I don&#039;t think they would look anything like a bomb on the xray as they are not remotely similar and will not contain explosive material (which is picked up by xrays)

				well i do not know how bombs look like in xray. however my imagination i assume it is some metal case with electronics inside. maybe the &quot;scale technique&quot; adds additional suspicion to it...<br /><br />the whole story however is about i don&#039;t want to raise attention since i will take some goodies on me during flight...

				I took an extended trip recently and had the same dilemma.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t flown in years and was all sketched out about carrying anything that might make them look twice at my bags. But I came up with a pretty clever solution to ease my fears... I mailed the contraband to myself at my destination! IDK were I got such a fab idea, but there it is! ;)<br />Granted I went through security in Podunk USA, but when I got to my destination I realized that I had in my bag a pill bottle with various vitamins and a couple hydrocodone tabs, and a few wrapped vitamin packs floating around loose, a pocket knife, and I forgot to pull out my bag of mini liquids in their clear bag for inspection.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t bat an eye at the x-ray machine. So my fears where probably a little unfounded.<br />Even though I wasn&#039;t really comfortable mailing it to myself &quot;in care of&quot; the people I was staying with. I&#039;d still probably just mail it to myself in the future. Sure beats the prospect of a negative encounter with TSA.

				Substance &amp; scales means possession with intent to sell at minimum if you get caught or drug trafficking if they don&#039;t like you. Don&#039;t take both with you, why do you even need to scales anyway? If you&#039;re going on holiday you can probably buy scales at a local market in whatever country it is and dump them at the end of the visit.

				scale is needed for portioning mdma<br /><br />what i found helpful from your comments is that i am not the only one worrying and it was good to rethink...<br /><br />i would have the scale in checked luggage... nothing suspicious besides in there... <br /><br />the goodies would be at myself (not in carry-on therefore no xray - we dont have body scanners)...<br /><br />

				Be wary of drug residue on your scales. Digital scales have nooks that can hold drug particles and you cannot find them unless you take the scales apart.<br /><br />Buy brand new scales and take those. If they give you any shit you can say &quot;Whateva! Scales aren&#039;t illegal, no drugs on those!&quot;

				I wouldn&#039;t bring both, whether checked, on your person or in carry on. If they found one (most likely the product) they&#039;d definitely search and find the other. <br /><br />That said, I don&#039;t see any reason a scale would be questionable, as long as it&#039;s clean. I mean hell, you can get a kitchen scale at fucking walmart. Remember, you&#039;re not using it for mdma. It&#039;s for measuring parsley, or chicken breast cuts, or envelopes to get the right postage.<br /><br />Aaaaand finally, if you&#039;re moving any decent quantity of mdma, especially if selling, just pick up a throwaway scale at your destination. They&#039;re not that expensive. <br /><br />Or measure your portions out ahead of time and gel cap &#039;em. yeah, that&#039;s the best option!

				I agree with itsfive, you don&#039;t need scales if you&#039;re just weighing personal doses. Either capsule them before you fly and possibly place them inside a medication bottle in your luggage or just eye it if it&#039;s a small amount (1g goes into 8x125mg amounts by halving 3 times) it&#039;s not like 5-10mg differences will really matter too much, if it was a very low dosage dug sure but MDMA isn&#039;t really that troublesome.

				If you&#039;re worried that the metal plate might look as a &#039;bomb&#039;, then you should pack the scale on it&#039;s side in your suitcase/trolly. They always scan in one direction and I suppose that a scale looks less scary with a scanner from it&#039;s side.
