				Their is a lot about this case on the Australian forum threads. In fact one of the reporters that sat in on the court case is a regular forum member on Silk Road and she reported he got raided because customs intercepted 12 packages containing&nbsp; about 48g of MDMA and 15g of Coke he ordered to his own address in his own name. When they raided his house they found some other stuff (more drugs and 50 stun guns) as well as well as texts and incriminating evidence (Silk Road Forum Post and Pictures of his Drugs he was Selling) of his computer. In Australia the whole Silk Road thing doesn&#039;t really mean much as they would have had enough evidence to charge him with supply regardless and drug importation has been going on for years. Anyway this is definitely not the first Silk Road bust, an Austrian vendor got done last year as well as a Canadian vendor. Moral of the story is just be careful and don&#039;t get careless just because your doing this from behind a computer.

				Thanks for the link. It is interesting to see how these things are reported in the mainstream media.<br /><br />My previous comment was aimed towards the back slapping police propaganda in the article. They made one arrest so they&#039;re cracking the champagne.<br /><br />SR is a serious business with serious consequences if you mess up.

				From memory his vendor name was &#039;Move It Nice&#039;,&nbsp; he also went by MIN. Can&#039;t remember the exact circumstances or the outcome but their were some links posted to newspaper articles at the time.
