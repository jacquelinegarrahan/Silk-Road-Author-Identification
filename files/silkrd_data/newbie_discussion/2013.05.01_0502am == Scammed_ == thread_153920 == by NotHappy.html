				I am a very experienced cannabis smoker, striving to be at a connoisseur level.&nbsp; I have recently received hash that I think has been adulterated.&nbsp; The vendor told me it is &quot;100% plant matter&quot;, no adulterant.&nbsp; Based on this I ordered 200g.&nbsp; Its arrived, but it dissolves in water, turning it a urine-like yellow, it gives a swore throat, makes me feel dizzy rather than stoned.&nbsp; This was meant to be distributed in my country, but I dont feel its safe for human consumption.&nbsp; Thoughts?

				I mean, if you ordered 200gs I&#039;d give smoke up for free two/three people you trust, tell them the situation, and see if they come up with the same results (tell them the situation first obviously).&nbsp; If so, talk to the vendor. Offer to compensate them accordingly.

				I can&#039;t give this to anyone, it would harm my business reputation.&nbsp; There are video&#039;s of people with the same problem on YouTube, they use a process of dissolving the contaminants to clean it, but it still often comes out unsmokable.

With viable proof you could go to your vendor and appeal, if they won&#039;t do anything you could then bring it to the forums for a public verdict.

				The vendor is Djabbar, product is &quot;Commercial Hash (plaque of 200 gram)&quot;, in a when contacted prior to the purchase, Djabbar claimed that hash was not adulterated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hash arrived in good time.&nbsp; The hash looks real and smells pleasant, but is rock hard, very crumbly, lighter burn it black instead of melting it, caused sore throat lasting 30mins, caused dizziness instead of a high or stone and most importantly, dissolved in hot water leaving it a urine like yellow color.&nbsp; Real hash should hardly dissolve if at all, THC is only slightly water soluble.&nbsp; These are all signs of hash adulterated with Henna, used for hair dye.<br /><br />I put up a 100% request in the resolution center.&nbsp; I contacted Djabbar and explained the problem.&nbsp; Djabbar insisted that the hash is not adulterated.&nbsp; I explained the problem to Djabbar again and asked for a full refund.&nbsp; Djabbar refused and offered a 0% refund in the resolution center.<br /><br />Try the test yourself if you&#039;ve ordered &quot;Commercial Hash (plaque of 200 gram)&quot;, take a small piece of hash leave it sitting in a cup of hot water.&nbsp; If it starts dissolving after a few minutes, then its adulterated (cut).<br /><br />This sort of behavior is abusing SR and vendors and we should all be aware of the vendors who mislead and scam us.<br /><br />Pictures to follow.
