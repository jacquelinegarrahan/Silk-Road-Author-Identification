				Last week i ordered some coke off the vendor &quot;dryice&quot;. I was very pleased with how professional the vendor was, communication was spot on and the product was amazing. (I ordered the cut stuff, not the pure).<br /><br />Anyway the vendor contacted me a week later notifying me that I was the lucky winner of the monthly competition. As you can imagine I was over the moon, it&#039;s fantastic to see vendors doing things like this, it keeps things exciting.<br /><br />&nbsp;The prize was for 500mg of cocaine, he notified me as soon as the competition had come to an end and took my details once again. After a few messages had been exchanged between us, he told me that he was sending me the &quot;pure&quot; cocaine, I was in shock. The prize was not meant for the &quot;pure&quot; coke. <br /><br />This just goes to show how honest and professional this vendor, he is always making sure that his customers receive nothing but the best. It&#039;s a shame not all vendors are like this.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t ordered from dryice, than i suggest you do so, because you won&#039;t regret it. I know for a fact that I will be back, and I will be a regular customer. <br /><br />Once again dryice, thank you for the service you provide, I hope you are in for the long haul. <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />MJ11

It&#039;s a shame I cant post in the normal section. Maybe when SR gets back up, post this link on your vendor page so more people can look at it, and also post some of their reviews. <br /><br />Hopefully SR gets back up soon, I can&#039;t imagine how frustrating it must be for all vendors and customers that have money in their accounts. I&#039;m sure everything will be back to normal shortly. <br /><br />
