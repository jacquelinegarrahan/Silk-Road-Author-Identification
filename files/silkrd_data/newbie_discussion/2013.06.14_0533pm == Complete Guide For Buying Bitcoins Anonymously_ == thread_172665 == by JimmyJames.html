				Hey guys! Just found SR a few days ago, and I&#039;ve been greedily taking in all the information I possibly can via the forums. I thought I had a pretty good idea of how to purchase bitcoins anonymously, but honestly it&#039;s been tough to figure it out. After reading through at least a dozen or so different posts relating to the purchasing of bitcoins, I still don&#039;t really have a clear picture of all the steps of the process from finding a good website to buy from, to actually getting the BTC into your Silk Road wallet anonymously. I&#039;d like to make my first purchase, but It&#039;s like I have a bunch of puzzle pieces floating around that I&#039;m not quite sure how to fit together. <br /><br />Out of frustration, I was about to scan my actual real life passport &amp; bill information into mtgox so that I could just get going (it&#039;s been about 5 days since I found the road, and I&#039;ve been itching to buy since I first laid eyes on the site :) ), but I&#039;m not sure whether that&#039;s an acceptable idea or not. I mean, buying bitcoins themselves isn&#039;t illegal or fishy, right? If I were to sign up with my IRL details on mtgox, buy the coins and then tumble them around, would it still be a super bad idea if I wanted my Silk Road activities to remain anonymous?<br /><br />Does anyone have any links to a start-to-finish guide for purchasing bitcoin and then getting it into your wallet? I&#039;ve read the buyers guide on the main site several times as well, but I feel like I didn&#039;t really get a full picture of all the steps that go into purchasing bitcoin anonymously.<br /><br />Thanks for the read! :)

				Hi Jimmy<br /><br />Welcome to the SR forums.<br /><br />Where you are in the world plays a big part in how you get your bitcoin and stay/become anonymous.<br /><br />If you are in America i suggest you read medicine woman&#039;s guide to obtaining bitcoin for Newbs.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />If your in the Uk or europe i can also give advice but this will require more effort and time so i hope your in US.

				I&#039;m really new to BTC too, but I figured it out and it&#039;s very easy! <br /><br />I used Bitinstant, it&#039;s safe and the fastest method out there (if you are in the USA). Second fastest method that I&#039;ve found takes 7-10 days...<br /><br />Pretty much you go to bitinstant.com, From - Local Cash deposit (trust me, it takes 10 min and anonymous), send to - BTC wallet. What you do once you get your zipzap email confirming your order you go to any store that has money-gram. I use walmart, All you do is fill in your info on the form. I used my real name, address, and phone number because buying bitcoins is legal and if anything messes up you can get your money back. There are lots of BTC wallets, I personally don&#039;t like Mt.gox cause of the info you have to send them and of the fee&#039;s. I use Blockchain.com. It&#039;s free and REALLY secure. Just make an account there and send your bitinstant BTC to your blockchain address. After you complete the moneygram at walmart it takes like 5-20 minutes to be in your blockchain/wallet.<br /><br />Then from there you send your BTC from blockchain to SR. It tumbles your coins so there is no way of anyone knowing where your BTC came from. Here is the guide I used, it is easy to follow and explains everything in detail. (FYI the pictures are outdated, just read the text though)<br /><br />http://cannabiscorner.net/guide-to-the-silk-road-part-4-buying-bitcoins/
