				I love my dick!<br /><br />A weird thing happened the other day though.<br /><br />I was banging this girl and I was gonna come but I didn&#039;t want to yet so I slowed it down. They after several more positions and a great deal of enthusiasm on her part, I realized I just couldn&#039;t come.<br /><br />She was even more disappointed than me (good girl).<br /><br />I think it was because she wasn&#039;t trying to come herself and just focused on me.<br /><br />Anyway I didn&#039;t like that very much. I felt let down by Mr. Happy and we had a long talk about it later. Not me and the girl - I mean me and Mr. Happy.<br /><br />Modzi

				Well.. sense you asked. I dont use it much, im not a virgin, but im not a veteran. My hand greets it maybe 3times a week, maybe? Idk. But I kind of do take pride in not feeling like i need to get my dickwet 24/7 as opposed to some people who seem to think thats what life is about..<br /><br />Also im self proclaimed to be socially awkward, so that might have something to do with it.

You have to look at the cool guys and then imitate them until it feels natural. Change your hair, clothes and even the way you walk and talk. make it a project.
