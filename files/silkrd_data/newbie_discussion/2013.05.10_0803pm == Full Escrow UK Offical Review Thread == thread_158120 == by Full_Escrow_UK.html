				Hey Guys,<br /><br />We are new on Silk Road and so decided to make a review forum thread so people that try our products can leave feedback/reviews to show we are legit. We have given out 10 free samples to gain feedback and hopefully get some reviews in this thread to get us started. Hopefully this will give confidence to future buyers. If leaving a review please comment on the entire experience e.g. communication, helpfulness, product quality/value and packaging.<br /><br />We really appreciate every review that is left and we hope we have pleased you all with our service&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br /><br />Full Escrow UK

				Hey FullEsUK! Your sample arrived this afternoon. I will not be able to give a full legit review for a few more days from now, as ive done too much MDMA this past weekend to accurately judge your gear. Few days time and i will get to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;What i can say, is that the letter is pretty genius. Totally feeling your style ;) Be back soon. Much love.
