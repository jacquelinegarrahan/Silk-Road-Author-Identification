				recently purchase something from SR. it arrived to its destination, the person accepting was sketch (with good reason) it wasn&#039;t his same mail man and the package was not in his hand. 5mins later the person accepting walked outside to see the mailman going was this what your roommate was expecting he saids i dont have a clue. The mailman proceeds to ask many question where does he work? when will he be home? gives him youve been missed slipped with a number that isnt the same as the post office number.<br /><br />2days have gone by. we get a bum to go &amp; retrieve the item from that post office he comes out saying that they couldnt find it. what do you guys think

				It sounds to me like you should take the loss. I&#039;d rather lose out on some product, than be prosecuted/incarcerated. But of course, it&#039;s up to you. SR is all about risk mitigation, and that situation sounds all too risky to me

				You should also research if a partial or full refund for detection is possible with your vendor. I recommend reading their terms of service carefully before placing orders.
