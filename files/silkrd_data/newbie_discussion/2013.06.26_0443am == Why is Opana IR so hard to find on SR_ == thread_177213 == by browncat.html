				That&#039;s the one thing I can&#039;t find on this site. Lots of ER posted but none crushable. I would think you could find anything here.

				Yeah high tolerance is my main enemy. Tried all the tricks and can&#039;t get it down. I used to buy on Topix, actually had good success there but once I got scammed for $800 I said no more. Been doing SR since that misfortune, but it&#039;s like finding needle in haystack so far to find the Pandas.

				Just out of curiosity why do you need to Percs to be 10/325? Why not just buy a larger pill (20,30,40 mg etc) and cut it up yourself? If you need it to be crushable, buy the 30mg blues as they are all over the place. Unless you really like the tylenol not sure why you would be restricted to 10mg Percs?

				The Percs 10/325s just seem to work best for me I guess I could buy 20mgs but they tend to be difficult to find too. I&#039;m a bit atypical - using silkroad because my drs. are incompetent and I have annoying family members - I need some way to treat my chronic pain issues and yah it just sucks.

				Do you take all the Percs orally? Or do they need to be crushable? Sounds like if it&#039;s legitimate pain you may only take them in a legitimate fashion.

				ghb - Pain pills make me feel energetic and I can be very productive/get a lot of work done. The one time I did H and felt it, it was like I was super zombie mode, could hardly stay awake and was in a trance. So unless I have not done proper H, I have not felt it was an OK substitute for a pharm high that you can go to work on. Have I just missed good H?<br />
