				Maybe you would be interested in testing ONE international sample in the name of testing stealth shipping? I would be more than happy to use PGP encryption to give you some ideas of how to properly go about this based upon the methods used by other vendors I have gotten packages from internationally? I will of course leave a full review and feedback for the sample as expected! (:<br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />Doctor

				Got one of the charas samples and am glad I did!<br /><br />I did the grit test (chewed a bit between the teeth) and it was smooth as. No gritty bits. Thing is, it was actually tasty! I could&#039;ve eaten the whole lot no problem... but I prefer my smoke ;p<br /><br />At first it did remind me of gold seal. The smell (although it was a bit mintier) and the texture. Once lit up, it was definitely not gold seal. After about 5 mins a slight head rush kicks in. It&#039;s nice, but could cause a little anxiety in those prone to it. I guess sativa is like that? After about 20 or so mins, it dies down into a head stone. Felt like I could go to sleep, but I could also get stuff done. Nice for anything creative for sure... or bedtime ;)<br /><br />A small lick of flame was enough to get it to fluff up and crumble very nicely.<br /><br />Comms.. excellent comms by UK4420. Speedy as hell delivery too - landed within 24 hours of ordering. Stealth was decent. Was overweight by 0.1g.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered another 2g, so hopefully it&#039;s consistently as nice as the sample. Will update my review here.
