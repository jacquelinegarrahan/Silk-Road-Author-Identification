				Can&#039;t post in the threads already started about this so might as well start one.&nbsp; Anyone think he&#039;s coming back?&nbsp; He&#039;s been off seven days now and all his listings are down.&nbsp; He stopped responding to my PM&#039;s about four days before he peaced out.&nbsp; Before that he was really good with a response.&nbsp; I got the MDA guide (god, hindsight is always 20/20 right?) and would be interested in the LSD guide.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a bonus. A review for his MDA from aldehyde guide.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think English is the authors primary language, and judging from DDW&#039;s post style I don&#039;t think he wrote it.&nbsp; Full of misspellings and poorly structured/worded.&nbsp; Several things he suggests are either wrong, outlandish, or will cause a huge fucking mess.&nbsp; Don&#039;t attempt the synthesis unless you have a decent lab, chem experience, and patience for days.

				There&#039;s a 30 page thread where people debate the merits of his MDMA guide and not one non-expert claims to have successfully synthed anything.<br /><br />BTW, does that guide you&#039;re talking about include pictures and it creates 3 grams at the end? Because you can find that on the internet for free.<br />

				No pictures, no three grams, and I don&#039;t know what one you&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; Link to it or PM me the link.&nbsp; I know there&#039;s one very similiar to it on psychonaut and totse2.&nbsp; I know paying for info like this is crazy!, but I got my monies worth. ;)<br /><br />I read that thread and a couple others on the subject.&nbsp; His MDMA guide is apparently better written (haven&#039;t seen it though) but still no one reports success.&nbsp; I mean, the synth he uses is old as hell, nothing new.&nbsp; Unless he has some magic way to get awesome yields on the last step I don&#039;t see it as a good way to synth MDMA.

				I bought the anhydrides for fun and profit list.<br /><br />He always replied to my questions. sometimes overnight sometimes it took him 1-2 weeks.<br />The last answer he gave me was 5 days before going MIA.<br /><br />I dont know why everyone wants to see &quot;one happy customer&quot;. its just not wise for the customer to let others know.<br />Hell i risk my money, risk trying some stuff that i dont understand in my basement and then everybody expects me to tell them to go ahead that it is risk free and that they should try it...<br />Hell no.<br /><br />@ OP:<br />I agree with you. the instructions are poorly writen, some details are vague.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I have tried everything in order to obtain super H, and i dont know what i got in the end...<br />I know it has a really bad smell and know after all this adventure, i jsut dont see anyone trying my super H...<br />It would be just irresponsible.<br /><br />Does anyone know how to verify... <br />I really Hope RON will be back and help us finish.

				@ yeababy :<br />You completed the procedure(s)?&nbsp; Why are you so suspect of the result?&nbsp; Color changes not right?&nbsp; Wrong solubilities?&nbsp; PM me if you don&#039;t feel like splatting it all over the forum.<br /><br />Seems like ol&#039; DDW may indeed be gone.&nbsp; Any one got some claviceps paspali aka Holy Grail?&nbsp;

				I sent you a PM.<br /><br />@ Mods:<br />Given the current situation, are we allowed to publish the information we bought from RP.<br />The idea is to get a conversation going in the hopes of determining how to finish what has been started. <br />Or perhaps to point out the flaws.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Yeababy
