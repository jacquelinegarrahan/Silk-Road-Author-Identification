				I&#039;m in the process of ordering 100mg of 2C-B from vendor &quot;Div&quot;. We&#039;re going to split it up between five people when it gets here. I&#039;ve read tons of online reports that snorting makes the experience much more visual, eliminates the awkward 2 hour come-up period, and is an overall better experience. However, some people say snorting 2C-B hurts like motherfucking hell. Whats your opinion? Keep in mind, I&#039;m getting the HBR salts, which are softer and easier to snort than the other variant iirc. Also, how much should we snort if we do? I&#039;m thinking one 20mg line each.

Seriously!<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t snort it. I&#039;ve played with most of the 2C NBOME class of &quot;designer drugs&quot; and really wouldn&#039;t recommend it. It must be directly absorbed by the bloodstream and ingesting it won&#039;t do anything since your gastric juices will destroy the drug before it gets into your bloodstream.<br /><br />Also, its EXTREMELY easy to OD on the 2C powders so I would take EXTRA precautions when using it. If you overdo it you could be in trouble, especially if you don&#039;t know your tolerance or how you or your friends will react.<br /><br />Measure out 200micrograms (.002 grams) and dab it under your upper-lip. Don&#039;t swish around your mouth with saliva. You&#039;ll feel the area go numb and the effects will start to kick in after 30min. You&#039;ll have fully absorbed the drug through your gums within an hour. When I do it with friends we just watch a movie till it T 00:60 then listen to music and chill for the remaining time. We do this so we&#039;re not talking and wasting the drug to saliva.<br /><br />Be careful and have fun! The visuals will be there trust me.

				Snorting is really going to hurt but you&#039;ll come up quick.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend eating it though especially if its your first time. 2cb can take a while to come up so plan on this and plan some activity where you guys aren&#039;t going to constantly think.....&quot;UH when are we going to feel this&quot;&nbsp; Go out in the woods for a walk or outside to toss a Frisbee, or if the weather isn&#039;t nice throw on a funny movie. Have a drink or two and relax...it will come and it will be awesome.

				id have to agree with jacking off on this one. snorting it is much more effective. if you never tripped before then eat it. if you are an experienced psychonaut then snort it.

				<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to argue with anyone here on the best method for what you&#039;re looking to accomplish. Instead, I will suggest you visit erowid.com, look up the drug and come to your own conclusions.<br /><br />The only thing I can without a doubt say about this class of drugs:<br />1. If you eat it you will be wasting it.<br /><br />Best of luck man.<br /><br />-CC
