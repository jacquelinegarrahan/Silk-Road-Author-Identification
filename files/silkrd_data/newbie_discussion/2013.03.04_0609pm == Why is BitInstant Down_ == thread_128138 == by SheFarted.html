				I used Bitfloor. Super easy- had to go into BoA to make a cash deposit, similar to what I&#039;d do with BitInstant but in a bank instead. Didn&#039;t ask for ID, didn&#039;t need an account there. Deposit had been made by the time I drove a few miles home, waiting for it to transfer to SR account.

				Why doesn&#039;t somebody set up a similar service?&nbsp; All they did was set up an account with some bill transaction proccessing co and then made phony bills for someone to pay once they get your request.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t seem to complex

				I&#039;m at a loss here, too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I finally located the products I wanted to get my grubby fingers on, pulled the funds, and went to make my deposit.&nbsp; BitInstant has been down for about 4 days now.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting frustrated as I want to get this over with.&nbsp; I could have gotten my products in person by this point, though at a higher price (but time is money, thus I&#039;ve technically paid for the extra in waiting time). =/<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to find alternatives, but I don&#039;t want to deal with a single person and trust them to get me my coins.<br /><br />They promised they&#039;d be back up today, but the moneygram services are now closed all over town for today&#039;s business day.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ll recommend Bitcopia.com ... It looks like they (he) is having website issues right now, but I have bought several hundreds of dollars worth of btc at a time from him, always quick to communicate and very quick to deliver.&nbsp; He uses Wells Fargo.
