				Self explanatory. First off why can&#039;t new customers buy without a hastle? I mean everything is in escrow, what can happen? Big deal if a dissatisfied customer leeaves a 1/5.Just allow the silkroad admins to change it, they should implement a feature like that, if the vendor can prove he didn&#039;t deliberately try and fuck over a customer. I just made my first transaction, its shipping right now. This will likely be my only transaction. Most of these vendors are selling over-priced shit, for 170$ I could goto the doctor and say I hurt my arm and get pills. This site sucks.

				Your missing the whole point. Everyone spoke of this site as if it was some type of drug user free market utopia. I find that its nothing but a hastle, vendor&#039;s with fake ratings, vendors who won&#039;t sell to new members, scams abound, prices that are absolutely ridiculous, and don&#039;t even get me started on bitcoins which are a ridiculous impediment too a solid community. I already see a doctor,if I was so inclined I could outsell every vendor here easily. I&#039;m wondering if people actually buy 11$/pill hydrocodone. The only cool things I have seen are the opium, and the india vendors who guarantee their shipments. I&#039;m really disappointed in this site, if I wanted to go through hoops and hurtles, I&#039;d buy shit from an online pharmacy. How many people really buy 10$ a pill vicodin?

				You are paying for the convenience and discreteness of ordering illegal drugs online shipped DIRECTLY to you. What else are you going to complain about? And why shouldn&#039;t vendors be able to deny new users? Even if the money is in Escrow that&#039;s still money the vendor doesn&#039;t have yet. And most of the new user scams involve them trying to wait for the auto-finalize (which is what, almost 20 days?) and say they never received their order blah blah and try to get a refund. That and they can give negative feedback to the vendor, for those out there trying to tarnish other vendors reps to make themselves look better. It happens. Don&#039;t like it? Please leave, I can already tell the type of person you are and this community doesn&#039;t need people like you here.

				The convenience of mail order isn&#039;t worth a 45% premium on products. Also what part of buying bitcoins is convenient? Also there are numerous legit online pharmacies that mail order. I can name 3 that are well reviewed, but I wont. How many new users are really trying to scam a vendor to lower their rating? Why not make it so a new users scores are weighted less, so a new user giving 1/5 isn&#039;t weighed as much as a more established customer leaving a 1/5. I fully plan on leaving my vendor who I am ordering from a 5/5.I am what this community needs. I just plan on ordering a few things that are hard to source.

				Also this site should sell bitcoins with a moneygram deposit. It would make the site more viable, if bitcoins were easy to get people would flock to this site. Vendors and sellers alike. Also there should be a tutorial for buying and transfering money. I figured it out easily, but not everyone would. Every person I spoke too about silk road have been like ohh it is too hard, etc etc. This would make it easier for more people to get it.

				First off, this community is all about trust. It takes a while to build up a reputation and be trusted with being sent very valuable goods upfront. This isn&#039;t ebay, there are no guarantees for anybody, and past behavior is all that really matters. Vendors have to protect themselves from constant scammers, most of whom are using new accounts. It is much easier to scam a vendor than a buyer. You as a newbie just have to relax, take your time, do the research, start small, be polite and patient and not fucking complain and not act all entitled. Just like the rest of us have. I got here not too long ago, was skeptical but went through the process and have had many transactions, virtually all of which went off without a hitch, and were of much higher quality than anything I could get on the street. <br /><br />Maybe you live in a place where you can get premium quality goods of any variety whenever you want for cheap. Good for you, why are you here? The rest of us are stoked to be able to order rare and quality substances and have them delivered to our door, even if at a markup. There is way more than enough information through the forums, feedback, stats etc to find the great sellers and get what you want. If vendor has 98%+ feedback, 300+ orders, has been on the road more than a few months and has tons of fans, you don&#039;t need to worry. Believe it or not, most vendors will cut you a break and let you buy small amounts even as a newcomer if you message them and don&#039;t act like a spoiled child; they might want you to FE, but if they are one of the big reputable sellers you will not get scammed. If they won&#039;t sell to you find someone else.

				Vendors are allowed to have rules like this. It is for their own protection usually. Just look for different vendors, it&#039;s not like it&#039;s the streets here, you can find many similar listings by clicking one thing. <br /><br />As a tip, if you&#039;re asking the vendor if they won&#039;t do business with you because of being new, that may bring suspicion. Just order without asking too many questions :)

				if your here for script pills your here for the wrong reason and yes your going to get charged out the ass for them<br />as for hassles with bitcoins and being a new member everything is set here for a reason everything is perfect for those who will put the little bit of extra effort to find what they are looking for... looking at vendor reviews from feedback and forums shopping around for prices etc.. stop bitching.. if you dont have the cash or the smarts to hang GTFO. the community has enough to worry about other than noobs who want to complain and make things more lax security wise so you dont have to take the 10-20 extra minutes it takes to do your own research on a given product or vendor.

				This site is primarily about relationship-building and if you look at it that way you will do well.&nbsp; Think of each vendor that you do business with as an individual that is a potential long-term partner instead of thinking of them as a name on the screen.&nbsp; Most quality vendors here very much want to build new relationships with honest, reliable customers and most vendors want this new relationship to lost for a long time.&nbsp; I agree with some of the previous statements that it takes time, research, and maybe some cash risked in order to learn more.&nbsp; Just the fact that you are here on the forums means you are open to learning more, so take this chance to read about vendors who sell what you want.<br /><br />SR is frustrating when you are new both as a vendor and as a buyer, but time and patience will be fruitful.

				I for one have never heard of this Group of 7.<br /><br />As for the OP :<br /><br />This is a market, and the vendors fully have the power to pick and choose how they operate and who they take on as potential clients.<br />Just like stores (at least in the US), they reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.<br /><br />I believe the hoops that you have to jump through in order to be a buyer here are needed. Nothing is crazy difficult to achieve, and like anything else, if you do enough research things go pretty smoothly. (lurk moar)<br /><br />Once you have done the proper research, getting BTC is easy peasy, and quick too. Once you do the proper research, you should be able to tell what vendor(s) you would like to do business with. If prices are too high for what you want, then you don&#039;t have to buy them.<br /><br />I have made a few transactions, I keep my purchases small since I am buying for personal use and if I do get ripped off it won&#039;t be too painful. I always assume that any vendor may go rogue at any time and while I will be upset if I get ripped off, it is something I assume will happen at some point. Nature of the beast.<br /><br />There are some vendors here that have a lot of requirements in order to make a purchase. A lot of them get stellar reviews and people love them. I can&#039;t order from them yet, but I can&#039;t be pissed about it. These people are taking on a large risk to provide me a service, they can fully decide who to deal with. When I used to buy in person many many years ago, I couldn&#039;t have forced any of those dealers to sell me shit if they didn&#039;t want to. Same difference.<br /><br />Also, bad attitudes tend to not be well received, and may prevent you from buying from a vendor that would normally sell to you. They provide a service, I treat them with respect.<br /><br />ramble ramble etc and so forth
