Sex on both of them is amazing. I enjoy just taking a couple bumps of k after smoking a fat bowl of Tina. I don&#039;t like going into a k hole because then I won&#039;t be able to have good controlled sex. I don&#039;t like to be a roofied fuck toy. <br /><br />I find that I enjoy the k dissociative hallucinations more than the psychedelic ones. I don&#039;t know if my brain just isn&#039;t stable enough for them but I can set into a ketamine trip much easier. I think its because it comes on so fast. Even though my experience with salvia was the worst trip of my life.

I have slammed meth three times but iving is something I stray from due to the fact that the worst addict I have ever seen are the slammers. I have found a couple responsible.ones but it is rare. And I am not trying to offend iv users, I.am just reporting based off my experiences.<br /><br />I will snort something if I have to but I hate putting shit up my nose. And if speed burns as much as meth I would be even less inclined to do it. I enjoy snortig ketamine because its smooth and its onset is perfect for my body. I have thought about slamming it but I feel it might be too in tense. I fuckig hate k holes!!! Lol<br /><br />So if anyone knows a smoking method I will love u forever!!! And try to +1 you when I cab.

Been there done lots of things in my day, and at the end of my day, I chose cannabis. This was a LONG time ago. The different strains give you different affects, perfect for every occasion. I have MS so the medicinal benefits are nice too, except I don&#039;t live where I can reap the rewards for being disabled. <br />I think you should add Alcohol to your list!!!<br />LOVE the Road

				ahh what a difficult decision to make!<br /><br />i looooove MDMA but try to be responsible with it and only use a few times a year at awesome events. so if I could only do that ever again it would be awesome but I would miss being able to use things more frequently.<br /><br />opiates are my second love. &lt;3 but definitely would be a hardcore addict if this was the only thing i could do ever&nbsp; &nbsp;:-[

				As much as I love my occasional opiates, I get a little cranky after a couple of days without weed, and have even been known to trade off my other drugs in order to not be without pot. So without a doubt, I&#039;d go with weed..<br />I&#039;m just glad coffee isn&#039;t on the list. Not sure what I&#039;d do if I had to choose between weed and coffee!
