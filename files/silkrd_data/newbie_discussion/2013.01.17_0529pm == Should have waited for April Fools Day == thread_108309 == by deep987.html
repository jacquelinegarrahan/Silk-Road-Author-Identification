Any potential &quot;help&quot; an actual newbie is looking for is immediately covered by spam, and no &quot;members&quot; are going to look at it b/c of spam and the perception that newbies only ask stupid questions that have already been answered.

				Newbies should be reading some FAQs and UTFSE here and on the clearnet before posting questions, anyways. I guess this way the dumb questions get sequestered to their own corner of the dark web.

				I seriously don&#039;t see the problem with the 50 posts thing, I think it&#039;s a blindingly obvious thing to do to combat spam and just stuff that we want to avoid. I&#039;ve only been here a couple of weeks (on the forums) and I haven&#039;t posted in any spam threads or went out of my way to rack up posts, and already I&#039;m getting close just by reading the newbie section and posting my thoughts about things or trying to help people if I can... what&#039;s all the rush? We can still read all of the other parts of the forum, why are people so desperate to post there lol. Even for people who are desperate, it would take what... maybe half an hour or 45 minutes to rack up 50 pointless posts and then you are let loose&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />It is a shame that the newbie section gets splattered with spam and bitcoin scams and shit... but that kinda just proves the purpose of the newbie section. These posts would just be all over the place all the time otherwise.
