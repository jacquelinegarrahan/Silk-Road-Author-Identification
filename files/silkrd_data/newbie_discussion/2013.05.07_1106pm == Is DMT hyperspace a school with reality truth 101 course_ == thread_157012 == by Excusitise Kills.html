				Recently I discovered DMT and the more I read about it the more I knew I had to try it for myself. In search of the Spirit Molecule I found SR and now I read this forum every chance I get because I feel like this community consists of real people without any political or any other agenda whatsoever. You guys are what freedom looks like. <br /><br />I have been experimenting with DMT for about 2 months now and had a few amazing breakthroughs. I have come to a conclusion (which is my opinion only of course)that what we are experiencing in hyperspace is a training exercise for how the Universe really works. Terrance Mckenna talked about entities trying to teach him how to speak with objects instead of words, and I had similar experiences on my trips. <br /><br />It reminded me about a few books I read years a go. They are called [The Science Of Getting Rich, Think &amp; Grow Rich, and The Magic Of Thinking Big.] There are many more books on this topic and most of them are pretty old. All of them try to explain that we are capable of creating our own reality by visualizing things we want and believing that they are already yours. Doing so with present you with opportunities to make it true in physical reality on this planet.<br /><br />So my personal conclusion is that something is trying to block us from being able to use this visual language in this reality, but God/nature/Universe whatever you want to call it, is trying very hard remove this block by putting DMT in nearly all living things on this planet. And when people finally put their hands on it and enter the hyperspace, these entities are trying to blow the whistle and show us the truth. <br /><br />Am I completely out of my fucking mind or could there be some truth to my theory?

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s anything external blocking us. It&#039;s merely our own physical limitations. That is, perception is created in the brain which can create permanent limitations. Think us vs creatures that see in the infrared or UV spectrum. We will never with our own eyes see what they see.

				Interesting thoughts. <br /><br />I agree with xtremeDetail, I don&#039;t think there is anything (outside of ourselves) blocking our perceptions. I think our perceptions are meant to strike a balance between survival and (evolutionary) expansion. So, we don&#039;t see the higher dimensions all the time because that would not be conducive for survival in the way our condition exits at the moment.&nbsp; I think that the DMT experience shows us the infinite potential of expansion in order to direct us toward these higher dimensions, but the limits that we experience on a day to day basis help keep us sane, which helps keep our bodies alive. If we stayed too constantly in those higher dimensions, we would lose interest in survival, or perhaps would not be able to function as would be necessary in order to survive.<br /><br />Consider farming for example. Imagine trying to farm for your food while your mind is perceiving the world as DMT shows you. The meticulous and detail-oriented nature of farming would be quite a challenge when you are seeing the world with DMT-like perceptions. <br /><br />Grant it, perhaps a being could be conditioned to experience DMT consciousness while also being able to maintain careful analysis of details and analytical thinking that is required in many aspects of survival. <br />Perhaps that is where (human) consciousness is headed, and the smalls glimpses one gets when one experiences DMT ( or any psychedelic) are the guiding lights towards that development. Maybe they are the way to navigate the unlit paths in the dark wilderness of the mind.

				Yea I agree, I feel you have to continue to evolve yourself from the inside. Begin influencing your ego to pursue higher purposes. You begin trancending paradigms of instinctual survival and primal urges. Expanding to something that greater benefits the whole of creation.
