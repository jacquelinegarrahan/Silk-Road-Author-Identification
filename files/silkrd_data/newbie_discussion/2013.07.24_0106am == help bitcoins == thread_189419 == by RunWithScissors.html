				I signed up for the site, and I was going to meet my person to hand him the cash. If you look there should be two sections: one where you meet in person and one where you do it online.&nbsp; The ones online will have different stipulations as far as what you can use to pay, like Western Union or deposit at a bank or even (I saw only one and with lots of conditions) paypal.&nbsp; From what I understood, I give the person my money and he then releases some code for me to claim through the local bitcoin site then I transfer from my wallet there to SR.<br /><br />INSTEAD...........<br /><br />I am trying something newer yet to me and that is obtaining bitcoin right here from bitmerchant.&nbsp; He is backed by a vendor I trust, and he uses &quot;reloadit&quot; cards and says he will get you bitcoin within the day if not within the hour.&nbsp; Sounded like less hassle to me than going off to meet this person from local bitcoin, PLUS the person I was buying from charged a pretty price for his bitcoin, compared to MtGox.<br /><br />That is all I know.&nbsp; Oh, and there is a forum over at local bitcoin and FAQs if you want to explore further.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Hope

				once you type in the amount you want, you then get the sellers bank details and a reference message. you use those to set up the bank transfer on your online bank account or go into your branch with the details. remember you only get 90 minutes to make the bank transfer and then get back to a computer to click the &#039;mark payment complete&#039; button. its the blue button further down the page.<br /><br />btw you can&#039;t message the seller until you send trade request.

				I too just made a transaction with a vendor online.&nbsp; I just followed the instructions the vendor asked for and within a couple of hours my bitcoins were deposited in my account.&nbsp; :D<br />&nbsp; <br />As far as localbitcoins work (from what I have read), you meet at a place that has WIFI (or a hotspot) and the transaction is either done via computer or smartphone in front of you and I also believe you can do it online.&nbsp; There are literally 1000&#039;s of posts on localbitcoins, it wasn&#039;t an option for me.<br /><br />I was really pleased with the vendor I chose on SR.

				Also, each person on localbitcoins should have reviews/feedback, so you can see who you can trust.<br /><br />I came THIS close to using this service. I decided to go with a merchant here (trying tomorrow).&nbsp; I hope I don&#039;t regret my decision.&nbsp;
