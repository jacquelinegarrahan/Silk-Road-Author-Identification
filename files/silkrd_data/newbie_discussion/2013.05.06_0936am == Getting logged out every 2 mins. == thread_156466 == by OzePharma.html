				Strange. When you get logged out, click back to get the page you were using and log in in a new tab. That way you won&#039;t be put back on the main page and have to navigate back to the lost page since by the time you get there you will most likely get logged out again.

				I am in the same boat with you all. Til SR gets working right again I&#039;m browsing over at Atlantis and checking reviews and feedback. Vendors are giving great deals and free samples because they need more buyers and vendors to get it going.<br /><br />[CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion/login<br /><br />Check it out

				Just a fair warning for any one looking to make a buy on Atlantis, it clearly states in their terms of use, that they can and will if need be, turn any and all information over to the government.

I believe they&#039;re just trying to cover their ass. Now it takes several tries to log in (even though my info&#039;s valid, there&#039;s no error message) so SR is almost unusable. Who needs a DDoS when you can deny your own service? Practically doing the job for them.

				have you guys been rt-clicking the links and &quot;open in new tab&quot; for every everything? then that&#039;s the problem.<br />the moment you have more than 3 tabs open, you get booted.<br />i believe this to be the measure taken to protect against DDoS attacks.<br />As long as i browse the market place in just 2 tabs, i do not get booted.<br /><br />Also, i find the webpages are loading MUCH faster now...

				Came to post a topic about it, glad to know it&#039;s not just me. I am not too concerned as long as DPR is working on it. It&#039;s annoying though because after I get logged out it seems like the first 2 or 3 times I try to log in I ALWAYS fail, and I don&#039;t think I am entering anything wrong.

				As DPR stated, we are not out of the woods yet as far as the attack goes.&nbsp; Until then, yes, there very probably WILL be issues with things taking longer than usual or people being logged out at random.&nbsp; DPR is aware of these specific problems.
