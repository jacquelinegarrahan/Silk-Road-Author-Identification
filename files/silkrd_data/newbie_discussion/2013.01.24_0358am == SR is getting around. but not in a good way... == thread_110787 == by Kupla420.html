				So recently I&#039;m hearing that a lot of people know about SR. Yeah it&#039;s good if people are using this site to keep it going, unfortunately that isn&#039;t the case with all of it... Most of these people that I&#039;m finding out know about this aren&#039;t even using the site and some don&#039;t even do drugs. There&#039;s no need for those kind of people to use the site. It seems like a lot of people are just starting to either brag that their on here or just can&#039;t keep their mouth shut. I even found out from one of my friends that someone he works with knows about the site because her dad uses it. She doesn&#039;t do any sort of drug so what need is there for her to know about it, especially from her dad? This is definitely starting to rise some concern with me that so many non users know about this site... I don&#039;t know why people are going around telling everyone about the site but people need to start keeping this to themselves. If their not going to use the site, don&#039;t tell them about it. If someone is asking for a specific drug just say you can get it. Don&#039;t say oh you do well look at this! The more wrong people that find out, the easier it&#039;s going to be to get this shut down. It seems like there&#039;s way too many careless people out here. One of my friends just straight up told me that a few of his friends are on here and I didn&#039;t even mention anything about this site, none the less none of my friends even know I&#039;m on here. People don&#039;t seem to be having a problem letting everyone know this site exists...

				I don&#039;t know what&#039;s making a lot of users feel the need to just spread the word of this site. I&#039;m guessing you guys agreeing means you&#039;ve heard others talking about it too? I don&#039;t know about you guys but (since we keep our identities secret on here all I will say is) I&#039;m from the midwest states and it seems like a lot of people out here know of it. Another reason why I don&#039;t get why people are spreading it is even if it&#039;s to people who use drugs, why would you want them to know? Then they might want to get on it too and if you&#039;re looking to sell, that just means you lose profit... There&#039;s really no need for anyone but yourself to know.<br /><br />My friend got me on here didn&#039;t even want to get me on here at first cause he&#039;s thinking the same way I am. He got me on here though cause we like an assortment of drugs and he knows it would be stupid if we got everything we wanted sent to him and he knows I sell and have been looking for better quality/ prices. The only person I have told is the guy that I partnered up with so we can spread our goods out even more than that. Besides that, I haven&#039;t told anyone and my friend is very secretive just like me so I know for a fact he didn&#039;t tell anyone, especially since he knows how risky this can be he doesn&#039;t want any extra worries.<br /><br />With word getting around so fast it&#039;s making me seriously reconsider the continued use of this site... All the LE needs is to have a majority of information that drugs are being sent through the mail and within a few months they could easily increase their security watch on the mail and repeated package sending to the same place even over a period of months. This isn&#039;t looking too good for us...

				Yea I came to the realization that all users of SR get very annoyed when hearing about it in real life because they are used to discussing and reading about the road on the forums from the perspective of users but the majority of people in real life just say ignorant comments.

Just because you use drugs a lot or have been for a long time doesn&#039;t mean you have no fear of LE. And if someone who knows of this site who doesn&#039;t use it gets mad at someone who they know uses it and they want some hard core revenge, the cops will go to his house. Say he&#039;s not that tough of a person and he can&#039;t take the pressure and he lets them into his account thinking he&#039;s going to get a better deal. Now even worse, what if he&#039;s a veteran user who has built a good connection with his vendors? A lot of the vendors on here seem to be extremely nice people, even to me (knowing I&#039;m a new user). If that vendor and that guy got busted anyone who he had a good connection with good possibly given even the slightest bit of information that could have them located putting all those people at risk. Sure maybe the whole site may not get busted down but it still wouldn&#039;t be right for those vendors or even other buyers that person connected with to get busted because of a hateful non user who turned someone in. Not everyone has the will to act like an invincible wall to LE.<br /><br />Plus if they have a good connection with a vendor, some vendors might actually put their real address for returns. I&#039;ve actually seen vendors on here say that they always use their real address for returns so they have no problems with returns or get any suspicion put on them from dropping something off and then when it went to be returned the place had nothing to do with them. So that also leaves the possibility of them making purchases of all vendors in the chance they may get one or even multiple active vendor addresses. Even telling a spouse is dangerous. Think of all the crazy revenge shit you hear on the news or radio that a husband or wife did cause they found something out like they cheated or some shit. What would keep them from going to the police as their form of revenge? People really just need to keep this to themselves... You never know what the future holds with your friends or even what kind of person your &quot;friends&quot; truly are.

I&#039;m saying it&#039;s for people who AREN&#039;T using it to know. All it take is one person to blab to the wrong person to cause a problem for a lot of people. Trust me, I would love to be able to brag about the fact that I&#039;m part of pretty much the most illegal black market in existence, but I know that not only is it not necessary for people to know but also it&#039;s easier to make enemies than friends and a huge majority of your friends come and go through out life and all it takes is one really pissed off friend to fuck things up, you know?<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying there&#039;s anything we can do about it and I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s east for everyone involved with this site to get busted. But I definitely do think people should think of the possible consequences that can occur from the word getting around too much and especially to the wrong people. A lot of the people on here seem like they&#039;re good people and all of us are just trying to help each other out. Even if it&#039;s just them who gets busted it still sucks that they have to get taken down just cause they told the wrong person. I&#039;m not worried about my safety because I&#039;m making damn well sure no one knows I&#039;m on here. I&#039;m posting this topic in an attempt to try to help keep others safe. Even though I know literally none of you and more than likely will, it doesn&#039;t mean that I could care less that people are getting arrested just for making a simple mistake in any way. That&#039;s why I look through the forums for help posts and try to give the best advice I can so that someone doesn&#039;t get busted. I&#039;m more than willing to help people stay as safe as possible by giving advice. Especially with my fail proof method for how to not get busted in the instance of a CD.

I can totally understand wanting to tell someone about this awesome secret you know about. I&#039;d love to brag about it but I know that could be a huge mistake, not only for me but for other users on here. So I posted in the hopes that people will see this and reconsider telling others about this site.

				I&nbsp; think DPR has said he likes that more people are hearing about it, he allowed a journalist on the forums to have an interview or write an article about it. This way more people will use and will mean more competition among vendors so better prices.

				I truly think that all of your friends, and many people who know of it (SR) are really just passing on something they &quot;heard through the grapevine&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Most kids think it cool to say they know of something illicit , (and some immature adults as well) So they are just blabbing and soon forget about it....If perhaps, they actually have found a way to access the site, maybe they will ultimately put it to use. In which case, their lips will certainly pucker to protect themselves from criminal recognition? If not, then it is only themselves they put at risk, for they know nothing of anyone here. <br />Ultimately, I agree with keeping SR to yourself and remaining anonymous in your community in regards to your activity here. But, we must remember, as everyone else has said... We are being actively watched daily on here. Media throws it out there every now and then, but it quickly becomes &quot;old news&quot; and the general public forget about it. So, we are a known community. Polygamy is a well known community, illegal in most states. Some are curious, and may bring it up in conversation, however most would never visit a polygamist community unless serious about its practice.<br />LOL, Sorry for rambling, <br />BD

Not only can they not shut it down, they have the added insult of us hijacking the postal systems in order to transport huge amounts of drugs lol.<br /><br />I am always worried when I log in and it takes a while. The thought always goes through my head &quot;is today the day that they&#039;ve managed to get dox on DPR, or break the site&quot; but so far so good. Hopefully as time goes on all that will happen is the site will get harder and harder to fuck with.<br /><br />I tip my hat to Jacob Appelbaum and his fellow geeks for making this all possible with TOR and bitcoins. Fuck the system.

				lot of people don&#039;t even need SR they have CRAIGsLIST, yep go on any craigslist for sale in ANY California city and type in &quot;Prop 215&quot; and you will see over 500 ads on any given day. People are freely selling hash, weed, clones, seeds, growing equipment, renting out space for growing. <br />People sell pills, meth, they are selling and listing their phone numbers right there. COPS can bust people all day if they had the RESOURCES.<br />THAT&#039;s the key they don&#039;t have the resources to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s much more difficult to locate people on SR to bust, at least for weed, then craiglist. <br />A cop can set up a meeting within an hour to personally meet the seller and arrest them.......BUT it rarely happens....if it did there wouldn&#039;t be hundreds of ads. CHeck it out, EVEN ads to ship pounds every day of the weeek.

				I agree - LE and government in general know all about SR, and I assume that there is at least a modest amount of monitoring. I think the only way they can get their hooks into it is through BTC - no way can they make a dent in the package delivery by mail system since there is just too much volume to track it all (assuming everyone uses best practices). I don&#039;t know all the technical details on how Tor works, but I trust and hope that those running it can stay ahead.&nbsp; That leaves BTC, and there&#039;s the part that worries me. The US just passed some sort of money-laundering law to try to get some control, and I&#039;m figuring that there will be a continuing and increasingly strong attempt to get BTC under control (god forbid that they&#039;d expend that effort in getting the Big Banks and the oligarchs under control). Let&#039;s hope they can&#039;t do it - remember, LE and government are a lot dumber and lazier than they want you to think they are - most busts are the result of information dropping into their lap rather than craft and cunning.

				Who cares, really? Law enforcement agencies across the world know all about SR and what is done here. There are tons of videos, articles, and blog posts about it. Adam Kokesh even did a video on YouTube only a couple weeks ago called &quot;How to Buy Drugs Anonymously on Silk Road&quot; (or something similar to that).

				In all honesty, I don´t think the fame matters. It is already at teh forefront of many LE´s agenda, before it started getting popular. <br /><br />The thing is they have to find the server/s, if it operates the same way as tormail, even if one server is found there are 4 or 5 ready to take its place. SO its just an&nbsp; ongoing rat hunt. <br /><br />So although popularity isn´t always good in the media sense, I think it does little to affect our security. <br /><br />ACE

				Yeah SR doesn`t need anymore media attention. I see nothing wrong with adults obtaining substances by mail order. First of all if someone is going to do drugs they`ll get them anyway they can. Personally I would rather order online because it elliminates the danger of buying &quot;on the street&quot;. The gov`t and DEA are just mad cause they can`t control it or charge taxes on items sold.

Yeah it&#039;s good if people are using this site to keep it going, unfortunately that isn&#039;t the case with all of it... Most of these people that I&#039;m finding out know about this aren&#039;t even using the site and some don&#039;t even do drugs. There&#039;s no need for those kind of people to use the site. It seems like a lot of people are just starting to either brag that their on here or just can&#039;t keep their mouth shut. I even found out from one of my friends that someone he works with knows about the site because her dad uses it. She doesn&#039;t do any sort of drug so what need is there for her to know about it, especially from her dad? This is definitely starting to rise some concern with me that so many non users know about this site... I don&#039;t know why people are going around telling everyone about the site but people need to start keeping this to themselves. If their not going to use the site, don&#039;t tell them about it. If someone is asking for a specific drug just say you can get it. Don&#039;t say oh you do well look at this! The more wrong people that find out, the easier it&#039;s going to be to get this shut down. It seems like there&#039;s way too many careless people out here. One of my friends just straight up told me that a few of his friends are on here and I didn&#039;t even mention anything about this site, none the less none of my friends even know I&#039;m on here. People don&#039;t seem to be having a problem letting everyone know this site exists...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />silkroad is an effective way to get people into bitcoin <br />I guess some investor might just talk openly about it for their own benefits<br />

				Many know, but few can access... I was surprised how easily the .onion was PM&#039;d to me on the reddit forums though.... Long time lurker, first time buyer as of today. Hoping for the best! Come on googleyed and brownpurple31!

				I think you all are looking at this wrong.... I think of it as a &quot;Where&#039;s Waldo&quot;.. The more people who get on the site, to use, to browse, or just for pure curiosity, means that there is more activity. In turn making it harder for LE to pinpoint the certain targets. When there is a massive user base, the chances for a single user getting caught up in bullshit gets smaller and smaller. The mass media has already made this market VERY public, so I am not sure why this topic is even on someones mind. I do not wish trouble to fall on any of us Roadies, but as we all know, there are careless users who WILL end up screwing up. Survival of the fittest comes into play here. Stay smart, play safe, and live life to the fullest. 8)

				There were some kids in a class I TA talking about how cool the &quot;dark internet&quot; and how a friend showed them a site that they could buy drugs on called SR. I overheard them, and lied. Put the fear of god, and the FBI in those kids. Some people are just not ready.
