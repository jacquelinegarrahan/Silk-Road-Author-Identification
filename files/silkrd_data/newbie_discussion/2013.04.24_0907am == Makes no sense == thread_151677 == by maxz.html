				How to make a completely anonymous drop spot? If someone could PM me that would be great! I cannot find it as my computer is so slow on Tor today but if someone can help me I would deeply appreciate it!<br /><br />Thanks!

				basically he had a person agree to recieve it for them (this person did not know his real name or even what was being recieved) so when shit hit the fan he just dissapeared, dont know what happened to the person who lived at the address, I would assume they could say they had no clue what that was and it wasnt for them obviously because It didnt have their name on it

It would be helpful if you spent a little more time composing your sentences&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Do you mean someone has snitched on you to LE (law enforcement) about your SR activity?&nbsp; Are you wondering how much credence the LE will give to the snitch&#039;s information?<br /><br />Am I right in thinking the snitch has told the LE that you are expecting an illegal package but they don&#039;t know where it will be delivered?<br /><br /><br /><br />If I am guessing right then I would treat it seriously.&nbsp; Regard you package as lost. Don&#039;t go to collect it in case the LE are watching you. It would seem very unlikely to me unless you are a dealer and are receiving large amounts through the post, but better safe than sorry. Maybe you have previous so teh LE are more likely to keep an eye on you.<br /><br />The best you can do if you know someone has grassed you is stay calm. Clean house, change your drop point, stop ordering for a while and tell NO ONE about your SR activities, where you get your drugs from and how it all works.<br /><br />If you have never been in trouble with LE before, have only been ordering small amounts then I wouldn&#039;t worry too much. Remember say nothing, deny, deny, apart from to call your lawyer.<br /><br />All the best.<br /><br /><br /><br />
