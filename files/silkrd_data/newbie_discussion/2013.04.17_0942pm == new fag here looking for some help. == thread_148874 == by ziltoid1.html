				oh and about domestic ordering, theres something easy u can do.<br />choose a category from the SR-menu, then at the top of the listings there is an &quot;domestic/residental&quot; box.<br />if u tick it, it filter out the listings to the country u specified in your SR-account settings (profile settings)<br /><br />and if using the latest TOR-bundle i cant see a reason why usb should be more unsafe then another way of access undernet. just dont carry the stick around with you :P

				haha :) if its ure first oder i can fully understand.<br />man, back when i first got here i was way to paranoid also.<br />dont get me wrong, being safe is not a failure, but soon ordering here will be nothing to fancy anymore ;)<br />just get a good vendor (check and research before) prepare for fail-situations like a intercepted package (what u gonna say then for example) and keep a clean house if you consider ordering more then usual .... ;)<br />from the wiki the most important part is the &quot;buyers guide&quot; read it with care and you are good to go.<br />start small, getting known to it!

				to be honest no true reason. its something ive done on image/message boards for years and years and just kind of became habbit. cause everytime i go to a new site or something and refer to myself as a nuby some asshole always said new fag. so i started out my post with it to beat people to the punch. i support gays 100% and i dont mean anything by it. its just something ive done for years. and ever since ive started it its stop the slander of me being a newbie when i post haha. anyways fag mean cigarette right?! or a bundle of sticks haha&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;D 8) :-* :-* :-* :-*<br />&nbsp;

				You mean MT Gox and you don&#039;t want them, if you are UK then use localbitcoins.com and a trusted seller, if you US etc then fuck knows..<br />Yes you have to use Bitcoins, its not that hard once your rolling, also have you got a PGP?

				Ziltoid, I am right there with you. I just joined up not too long ago and have read and read...and have figured everything out (I think) except for the pgp thing.&nbsp; I posted this on another newbie thread. I know that it&#039;s some type of encryption, but I cannot figure out to work it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how to de-code or code my own messages. And the one piece of decryption software to downland that I read about gpg4win, is not compatible with my atonomizer.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, if you figure out how to this pgp things works before I do and can post it to me in the simplist of terms, I would really appreciate it!<br />Also, if I figure it out, I&#039;ll do the same for you.
