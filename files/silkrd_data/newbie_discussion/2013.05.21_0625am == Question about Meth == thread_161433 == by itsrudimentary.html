			<dd class="postbody">
				I feel very newbish asking this question but I can&#039;t find a straight answer to it. I am looking to try Meth and I have been looking at vendors that offer them in small quantities (sleepwhenyoudie or xinhai). I am looking to do it to have energy for a music festival for hopefully ~10 or so hours. My question is this, can crystal meth be ingested orally? I know people usually do it in other ways but I would be more comfortable ingesting it (even if it has a lesser effect) for my first time trying it. Any input on this would be appreciated as well as any other recommendations.<br /><br />Thank you!

				Personally my preference is to ingest it; it lasts longer and it&#039;s more of a focused/productive feeling.&nbsp; Definitely effective if you swallow it.&nbsp; Granted, some consider it a waste because less of it gets absorbed into your blood, but the feeling is a little bit different for every route of administration (RoA) -- so if you like the feeling one way more than another, it&#039;s hardly a waste :)<br /><br />You can swallow it just like a pill.&nbsp; Be very careful though, because most of the pills you see are only one tenth the actual medication and mostly inert fillers.&nbsp; If you swallow an aspirin sized chunk of meth you&#039;re going to get a much bigger dose than you mean to.

				Wow thanks everyone for the replies! I will definitely try it then. SelfSovereignty I do have a scale, my next question was going to be regarding dosage. I wouldn&#039;t dare do 0.3 grams! But if I want to be wired for roughly 10 hours would you say ~10mg is a good start? Also - parachute it - as in, put it in a piece of paper and swallow it? If I put in a cap would it take ~1-2 hours to hit me instead then? <br /><br />Thank you all again!

Im 165 when im not a mess, and at that weight 10mg for my first time had me tweeking for 8+ hours lol. <br /><br />Yes, i suggested parachuting. Use a joint paper, or toilet tissue. Ive seen caps take 10 min to kick in, and ive seen them take as long as 3hrs! This i can attest to, for it was my that took three hours to feel a cap.. and it was a bomb, 2cb,mdma,k and meth. <br /><br />&nbsp;I suppose how long a cap takes to melt, depends on A) stomach content, how long prior did you eat and how much, B) stomach acidity content i would imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;Im sure SS will chime in with some more info.

				Awesome.. again, thanks everyone, I wasn&#039;t expecting everyone to be so helpful. I am roughly 180lbs so believe I will do that then (10mgs, bring more just in case). Dirtybiscuitzz718 your combination seems pretty mind blowing, don&#039;t think I could do that yet haha.<br /><br />Since you all are so knowledgable, could you tell me any other recommendations for when I do try it. Eat little before hand or such? Anything that is helpful to take later? Also, anything to do with safety or tolerance I might want to be aware of if I plan on doing (separately) 2c-b and mdma that same weekdend?<br /><br />Thanks everyone

				hello i&#039;m sure by now you have already found a good way for you to take meth. but if you are interested in digesting it another good way i enjoy is taking an amount you would snort in one line and put in a little piece of toilet paper and take that way

Meth is more expensive than even the best cocaine.<br /><br />As far as I am aware, meth is the most expensive drug known to man, except for maybe a few obscure designer drugs (research chemicals, aka RCs).<br /><br />I keep telling people to plug their meth, it&#039;s a fraction of a percent less effective than injecting it directly into your vein (slamming it), but is very easy, and eliminates the icky needle-in-your-arm bit.<br /><br />Some men feel unmanly stuffing drugs up their butt, but you sure can&#039;t beat the convenience and cost-effectiveness.<br /><br />Some men need to grow a pair and stop being a pansy.<br /><br />Real men plug their meth.

				Just a quick reply to everyone who has added to this thread. I did go the oral route with roughly (need a better scale) ~10mg. It was taken around 8:00pm or 8:30pm... partied until ~5:45am... felt like death on the ride back home. Eat some food and finally laid down which felt amazingly better after going non stop for so long. However, it was still difficult to sleep and didn&#039;t fall asleep until maybe 8 or 9 am and did not sleep for that long anyhow. Next time I will opt to do half that amount since I don&#039;t foresee myself going out for that long again.

				Thanks for the update.<br /><br />It&#039;s just so long-acting and most people don&#039;t expect something they take at 8 pm is going to still affect them at 8 am.<br /><br />Without a proper scale, 10 could have been not 10 mg.&nbsp; It could have been up to 15 mg, i think.
