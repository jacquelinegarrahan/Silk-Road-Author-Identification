				I just placed my second order for 300mg DMT with Vatican (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b6022bf906). Doing some looking around, I am pretty sure that he has the lowest price for small quantities of DMT (about 13 US dollars for 100mg, 23 for 200mg). Some vendors sell changa that is more expensive! Great for a personal stash!<br /><br />My experience with him has been one of my absolute best on the road. I don&#039;t have much forum presence (trying to start building it up now), but I have made a fair number of purchases on the actual site in my few months of experience (19 transactions and 5.73btc spent). I have ordered from some very popular vendors like albionessentialols (who is hailed by LSD Avengers as King of SR--this is a well-deserved title, mind you). <br /><br />My point in bringing this up is that Vatican&#039;s professionalism and stealth are 1000% on par with the best around. I don&#039;t want to divulge his stealth methods, but my first order was disguised in a very, very clever way. It is the kind of stealth where if it were to have been opened by customs, it would likely have been closed again and sent on its way. Not to mention that the shipping speed beat several domestic orders that were in transit at the same time. I have noticed that orders from his part of the world (I won&#039;t say where since he has his location listed as &quot;undeclared&quot; and must have some reason for this) arrive strangely quickly to where I am located (east coast US), sometimes even in just 3 or 4 days from placing my order.<br /><br />And lastly, the product itself is divine, and I mean that literally. I have only tried one other source of DMT on SR (DRShrooms 100mg white DMT), and Vatican&#039;s was superior according to my experience, both in quality and in stealth (Vatican&#039;s stealth is infinitely superior; the quality is comparable, but I thought that Vatican&#039;s was a bit whiter and more potent). Superior to the point that once I finished my order from DRShrooms and was looking for more, I pm&#039;d Vatican to ask when he might be restocking. I was happy to hear that it would be soon, and he messaged me without provocation a few days later letting me know that the product was back in stock. I was quick to get some coin together and hit the order button :) Anyone looking for DMT should do so as well!<br /><br />My first order with Vatican was my first DMT experience. I tried dipping my toe in a few times, smoking just a bit at a time to feel what the effects are. I spread it over a few days, and my last experience was the biggest dose I took. After vaporizing about 20-30mg, I saw the surfaces of my room start to shimmer and wave. Patterns on posters and wallpaper became pastel smooth and three-dimensional. It seemed like time to shut my eyes, and immediately I was put into orbit around entity in hyperspace. This was my first experience with feeling the presence of an other-worldly being, and I think that this same being has reappeared to me in other drug experiences since then.<br /><br />I have a difficult time putting into words my spiritual hallucinogenic experiences, and I try to avoid doing so in my everyday life since words limit what can be communicated, but I am attempting to do so for the sake of advocating for Vatican. I can still remember what the being&#039;s face looked like fairly clearly, and it was much like this: http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/456398/456398,1295485581,4/stock-vector-aztec-face-69355114.jpg (forgive my use of stock images). It had several tongues that wiggled around as I orbited. Also in orbit were a number of other strange organisms, some human-like, that when they passed by, I could see intricate detail on their bodies. They were patterned much like an Alex Grey painting (as much as I dislike deferring to &quot;psychedelic art,&quot; his complex aesthetic matches my visions rather closely).<br /><br />It was a little while before these visuals started to fade (perhaps 5 or 10 minutes), and I opened my eyes again and wished that I had more substance to return to that realm and go even deeper. Things still looked a little strange in my room, and I sat for a while on my bed thinking about what I had perceived. It was one of my more powerful and spiritual drug experiences, and I desired to communicate with the being. I since have communicated while entering realms on other drugs, and I am currently processing and integrating the things that I have been told and shown.<br /><br />I am eager to re-enter this realm and to push deeper with my incoming order from Vatican. I thank him heartily for providing this beautiful substance and his great service on SR, and I hope he sticks around to share his product with many of you! Look no further than Vatican for DMT.

				TL;DR: Vatican is a super pro, relatively new vendor for awesome, clean DMT. Buy DMT from him.
