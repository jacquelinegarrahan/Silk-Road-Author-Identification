This thread is for anyone who wishes to review, discuss, or advise concerning this vendor.&nbsp; Please, no flame.<br /><br />Terabithia (who offers Heroin, Flexeril, Seroquel, Zoloft, and Trazodone) has only been on the Road for roughly two months.&nbsp; As a member of about a year (including lost or compromised accounts) and a fair sum spent with many different vendors, I have to say I was blown away by this new addition to the SR Crew.&nbsp; There seem to have been some early complications (DUI delayed several orders) but since, Tera has made up for that honest mistake more than generously.&nbsp; Since then, I&#039;ve read nothing and received nothing but good from this vendor.<br /><br />Now, as an infrequent heroin user, I have to mention the only dope I&#039;ve ever received was from SR.&nbsp; Deezle and deluxedelivery being the most notable vendors I&#039;ve dealt with.&nbsp; All of it has been of fantastic quality.&nbsp; I have no tolerance as my use has been spread out and I don&#039;t take anything that would cause a cross-tolerance.<br /><br />I put in a single stamp order (which, by the way, only runs you about $13+Shipping) of their &quot;Dead Medicine&quot; batch.&nbsp; I was a bit concerned about the reviews claiming they sent &quot;small&quot; stamps.&nbsp; Of course, a stamp is not a specific weight of H, but I&#039;m sure most regular H users have some standard I&#039;m unaware of.&nbsp; Sure enough, a small amount of powder arrived a few days later.&nbsp; Shipping time was on point.&nbsp; The stealth was lacking, and I would have been more concerned about ordering again if the vendor hadn&#039;t already addressed the issue by the time my order was filled. <br /><br />The substance in question was a tan powder, characteristic smell and taste.&nbsp; My partner and I (one large male, one small female-ish person &gt;.&gt;, no tolerance) split the tiny amount of powder, IV.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve nodded off on very few opiates I&#039;ve tried.&nbsp; The past batches of H and the handful of times I did opanas/Dilaudids usually didn&#039;t give me that signature nod. <br /><br />Half a stamp of this H had both my partner and I nodding off for about 3 hours straight.&nbsp; The rush was phenomenal, and there was a very clean come down.<br /><br />But hey, good heroin on the road is a dime a dozen, right?<br /><br />So if that doesn&#039;t have you sold, let me sanctify this vendor for you :P&nbsp; The communication is what did it for me.&nbsp; When I expressed my concerns about shipping, the vendor immediately offered me a resolution that blew me away.&nbsp; Resolutions aside, the speed at which they respond to any (and all) of my messages has made me rank this vendor higher than most old-schoolers here.&nbsp; Not to mention they regularly offer extras depending on mood or under certain conditions.<br /><br />TL;DR- Great Dope, Great communication, improved shipping, and (as they say on their vendor page) Extras for regulars...&nbsp; What are you guys waiting for?&nbsp; Go check out some listings and place an order! :P<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/64e2c294c5&nbsp; (Vendor page)<br /><br /><br />Peace, Love, and Coconuts!<br />~Ali, signing out!

				I ordered four of Terabithia&#039;s stamps, I paid extra for the overnight shipping. Terabithia was very quick to respond to my messages, I had a good feeling about this vendor right away. <br /><br />Less than 24hours later my package arrived...so early in the morning I had yet to shower. <br />I got an extra stamp (nice!) bringing my total to 5...3 EZPass...2 Section Eight....1 True Religion<br />I don&#039;t know if they were different strengths or not, but the True Religion was my favorite, it was also a bit fatter than the rest<br />Very good quality for stamps, I would have thought this h came by the gram.....one stamp to test it and I got a nice rush, I waited an hour before i did the second one. The second one set me str8. Later on I did a third and lost my dinner!! oops, (still felt great, haha)<br /><br />Overall It was a very smooth and pleasurable transaction, I will come back for sure!<br />

				Terabithia is one of the chillest vendors I&#039;ve had the pleasure of doing business with. <br />I had some issues with my transaction, and it&#039;s the manner in which he (or she) handled the situation that is why I like this guy so much (I&#039;m just going to go with male).<br /><br />I placed my order a few weeks ago. As some folks know, he got popped with a DUI, and this caused some problems with his orders. Mine was one of them. I ordered on a Friday, and my package was sent on Monday. This was the day he was released from jail. The package was sent First Class USPS (Which isn&#039;t the best choice, but he was a new vendor. This sort of thing happens with new vendors). Unfortunately, First Class sucks. Two weeks later, I still hadn&#039;t seen anything in my mailbox. I decided to send Terabithia a PM on Silk Road to see what the hell was going on. <br />When this has happened to me in the past, I&#039;ve gotten all sorts of bizarre reactions. One vendor freaked the fuck out on me (called me every name in book, and then started crying about how his son was sick. Very odd), and others have done a variety of other aggressive things. Terabithia was nothing but apologetic. For my troubles, he sent me the original stamp bag I ordered + three extras. Four stamps. I only paid for one. And all of this was because I was inconvenienced. The next package reached my house in three days. <br />I won&#039;t go into too much detail, but I&#039;ve worked in those $500-per-meal restaurants where the service staff went to college just to be a waiter. So, I know a few things about over-the-top customer service. Terabithia acts with a level of professionalism and concern that I&#039;ve only seen in the upper-echelons of the service industry. I&#039;m serious.<br />He is communicative to the point that it seems he must be waiting to reply to my messages. He&#039;s honest, professional (it&#039;s worth mentioning twice), punctual, and seems to be emotionally invested in my satisfaction. I believe that Silk Road is revolutionizing the way the world trades in illicit substances (for the better, safer, and of higher quality) and it&#039;s vendors like Terabithia that are on the vanguard of this evolution. The street corner drug dealer will become a relic of the past, and shady business practices will be taken with them. I, for one, support this change. And a vote for Terabithia is a vote for a better future.<br />[/end rant]<br /><br />That being said, this guy is selling some sweet H at low prices. Two bags of that Miami Heat had me nodding for around 8 hours. I don&#039;t mean sleepy, I mean NODDING. I had to stay on my feet for the entire day. Any time that I sat down, my eyelids started closing on me. I had a really hard time keeping the damn things open. I had some errands to run (I never realized how much I like Ikea), and I really shouldn&#039;t have been driving. Driving in rush-hour traffic while nodding is a really stupid idea, but this gear had me feeling a bit... overconfident. Either way, I still felt fantastic 14 hours after my last shot.<br /><br />Generally, I&#039;m not a fan of promoting any sort of business. But Terabithia&#039;s conduct has really inspired me to be supportive of a quality vendor. We should make sure that the good ones, like Terabithia, have the reputation to overshadow all the shitty ones.<br /><br />Here&#039;s Terabithia&#039;s vendor page:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/64e2c294c5 <br /><br /><br />Check him out!

				My first H order on SR was through Terabithia and the quality was good but the size of the bags was so small compared to other stamp vendors I have never repeated my business. Someday I may, but I buy large quantities and it&#039;s a big risk when you get small stamps.

				Communication- Since I opened this thread, I&#039;ve had to talk a bit extensively with Tera to see what they want mentioned, and to verify claims.&nbsp; Always answers more quickly than I ever expect, sometimes within minutes at different intervals. 20/5<br /><br />Shipping- 5/5 On time, layers were involved.&nbsp; No MBB, but it arrived safely enough.&nbsp; No worries on my end and definitely upped the ante on stealth<br /><br />Product- 5/5 Brilliant quality, was nodding rather hard off of two, and again from a redose of one.&nbsp; Route- IV, mixed cleanly in water without heat.&nbsp; Very clean high and brilliant rush.&nbsp; Much larger than past stamps have been.&nbsp; So all the better :P<br /><br />Overall- Perfect as always.<br /><br />On a subjective, happy note, I ended up sharing with my partner and our brother.&nbsp; Had an amazing, almost therapeutic/romantic experience with my partner, and our brother learned how to love drugs again X3<br /><br />Wonderful work, in point of fact.<br /><br />~Ali

				I&#039;d like to explain some things, mainly why I love buying from Terabithia.<br /><br />With nearly every vendors anywhere, you pay for what you get or get less than what you&#039;ve paid for. Quality comes at a premium price; the more expensive, the better it is. Terabithia has shown me the polar opposite. I ALWAYS get more than what I paid for, in every respect.<br /><br /><br />His prices are the lowest I&#039;ve seen for heroin stamps.<br /><br />The quality is higher than I&#039;ve experience with any other stamp vendor.<br /><br />He always throws in an extra or three.<br /><br />I occasionally get a package in the mail with a few stamps, just because I&#039;m a loyal customer. I pay nothing for them.<br /><br />He usually responds to messages within hours, not days. He&#039;s got TOR on his damn phone, for fuck&#039;s sake.<br /><br />He&#039;s honest, friendly, and pleasure to talk with.<br /><br />The man knows how to keep people happy. Most vendors couldn&#039;t possible care less. It would be hard for Terabithia to care more. He treats me with more generosity than most of the people I&#039;ve dated.<br /><br />I ALWAYS GET MORE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR.<br /><br /><br />This is why I buy from Terabithia, and why I will continue to.<br />

				I thankfully haven&#039;t had the need to buy H on the road much, but when I do, I stay loyal to Terabithia.<br /><br />During a hectic week, Terabithia had some issues and what I ordered got lost in the shuffle; he reshipped, no bullshit, and threw in double the initial order.<br /><br />Quality has always been solid when I get from Terabithia; I know damn well a stamp from where I&#039;d normally get them on the street wouldn&#039;t have me feeling shit unless I did 3 or 4.&nbsp; One of Tera&#039;s and I am set for an evening.<br /><br />Price can&#039;t be beat, obviously, and I respect his willingness to make the situation right when it wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy to see some others who have had good experiences with him and I think he is rather underrated as a vendor.&nbsp;

				Where are there no reviews? You mean in the newbie one? <br /><br />Here&#039;s the regular one, and I&#039;m proudly one of the contributors to the thread. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=163884.msg1261192#msg1261192<br /><br />What do you want to know, I can probably answer it. <br /><br />Just cause you have less than 50 posts, doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t read the forum, you just can&#039;t post. <br /><br />Shit, you don&#039;t even need a SR Forum account, and you don&#039;t even need TOR, though I don&#039;t recommend the clearnet for any of this shit. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be up for a while, hit me up.

My bad! - My guess is, this is a newbie version of the regular thread?<br />Granted, I&#039;m the latest post on the regular thread for TB. That was two nights ago. - Well, there&#039;s an answer to why right there!<br /><br />Terabithia&#039;s profile gives you a current &quot;dated&quot; update as to the vendors legal hassles, something those of us riding the TB train, have accepted, and understand. I mean, otherwise, why complain? <br /><br />So I would say you&#039;ll start seeing reviews at least beginning, if not tonight (MON), than as the week goes on. I know my puny little stamps order didn&#039;t make it out till Monday&#039;s mail, so it MAY come tomorrow, just based on past logistics, but definitely Wed. <br /><br />I received good stamps from Terabithia 2 weeks ago. Just an add on to my regular DOC (not H). I must say, though the amount per stamp, was small, and you&#039;ve probably seen a lot of people saying this, the shit in there was very strong H. I&#039;ve gotten stamps 3X as fat from other well meaning vendors in the whole &quot;stamp race&quot; as it seems lately, and one of them was almost as good as TB&#039;s, the other ones seemed like Brown Sugar mixed with H. ( I don&#039;t mean some Urban dictionary term, I mean, actual Brown Sugar!) I won&#039;t say who, but they were actually trying out some extra&#039;s along with what I payed for, so I really can&#039;t complain. I caught a buzz (smoking), but my room smelled like maple syrup! LoL! - The things we do to get high! :P<br /><br />So there&#039;s a latest review, albeit 2 weeks old, but really, you can&#039;t expect weekly reviews for every vendor, unless their quality, or level of customer service changes. Whether it be for better or for worse. There&#039;s usually nothing to talk about, other than more praise, by those that like it, or more complaints my those who don&#039;t. <br /><br />Sometimes even the best vendors get a lousy batch. Sometimes a physically addicted soul has the unfortunate surprise, that the stamps are low volume, and although high strength, it&#039;s just never enough. You can&#039;t please someone in that state. Though, whatever the case may be, with Terabithia, they always make up for lateness problems, or direct one on one problems, with product replacement. <br /><br />Very rarely have I seen the feedback of &quot;only got amount of stamps ordered, thought I&#039;d get an extra like everybody else&quot;. So far, that hasn&#039;t been the case for me, but I&#039;m prepared to &quot;get&quot; exactly what I &quot;ordered&quot;, anything above that, is extra icing on the cake. That&#039;s my take on it. <br /><br />This probably isn&#039;t your vendor, if you get physically ill in between doses, aka physical addiction. - I&#039;ve been there, and I can sympathize. Not with H itself but with it&#039;s evil cousins located in pharmacies across the globe. <br /><br />The only thing worse than an opiate addiction, is a benzo one. Though Benzo&#039;s are statistically more lethal as far as a &#039;cold turkey&#039; goes. <br /><br />Well I went kind of long there, but felt you guys wanted &#039;something/anything&#039; to gauge your purchasing decisions. <br /><br />I hope I&#039;ve served that purpose. <br /><br />Stay safe, stay healthy, be careful, + keep your place clean of all paraphernalia and traces of drugs. - Just in case. <br /><br />- Chipster

				Well Chip, I&#039;ve actually ordered from Terabithia 3 times now, and even left a nice review in his rumor mill edition. I want more reviews for Terabithia. He/she is just awesome.<br /><br />I have been in legal trouble.. I do sympathize with Tera. And yes some batches (stamps) were on the small side, but Tera always took care of it. Even surprised the hell out of me for no reason! check the rumor mill review.<br /><br />So as you can see, I just want to back this vendor up.

				Just ordered one stamp from terabithia today. Express shipped. Only other vendor on sr i bought stamps from didnt send me anything good. I have almost no tolerance, so i definitely caught a buzz, but had to do the whole stamp. I remember back a few years ago in nyc i could get a stamp and would only do half of it and get a nice rush and nod afterwards. Will post when it arrives and review.

If you check on some of my posts, I&#039;ve said similar things, and it was basically, if you&#039;re in a rush, like you use so often you&#039;ll get sick if you don&#039;t get your order, then perhaps Terabithia is not for you.

				My first few orders with Terabithia went wonderful, but my last one I am still waiting for.&nbsp; Ordered on the 27th and I FE&#039;d because all the other orders went well.&nbsp; I had to report the vendor because I was not getting any replies.&nbsp; After reported I got my reply and was told it would be reshipped.&nbsp; Well I don&#039;t think it ever went out, because I have yet to receive anything.&nbsp; It&#039;s now been two days and I am not getting any replies again, so I had to report the vendor a 2nd time.&nbsp; Sorry to have to do this, but I placed an order with another vendor late Thursday (overnight) and it arrived today.&nbsp; So this makes me upset and wonder what&#039;s going on with Terabithia.&nbsp; I see all the feedback and other people are getting their orders, well where is mine?&nbsp;

				Has anyone heard from T lately? My order is able to go into resolution in 5 days so I&#039;m thinking that&#039;s what I&#039;m going to do if I don&#039;t hear from him. But, by the sounds of things, it seems that when people DO hear from him and he offers to reship, he doesn&#039;t usually get around to it. Kind of disappointing&nbsp; :-\<br />Someone mentioned they reported him; what does that do? How is it different from taking the order into resolution?

				I&#039;ve ordered twice from Tera. <br />Seems like a well intended vendor and has some clean dope. but the sketchy shipping and small quantities left me with mixed feelings.<br />My first order was for one stamp. It took two weeks to get to me. The bag was under 20mg,&nbsp; and I never got any &quot;extras&quot; for the hassle. Nonetheless, I got two nice little bumps that had me feeling good all day and into the night for under $20. So I wasn&#039;t complaining.<br />Second order I contacted the vendor on a Saturday and explained that I wanted to order a couple more, but I was leaving town the following Friday and could only order if I was sure the package was in the mail on Monday. He said it would &quot;for sure&quot; go out on Monday and even mentioned there would be &#039;extras&quot; for the lack of extras in the first order. I was like &quot;wow, what a cool dude&quot;. There were no extras, and It wasn&#039;t mailed until Wednesday. <br />The order did arrive that&nbsp; Saturday. Unfortunately I was suppose to leave on Friday and the delayed departure cost me several hundred dollars. I realize there&#039;s a risk involved in planning a trip around an order, and I don&#039;t blame the vendor one bit for my money loss. But ffs, I couldn&#039;t have been more humble in my request, or clear about my situation if I tried. Still I got the &quot;yeah, yeah, whatever&quot;<br />Out of the three bags I got the second time around, two contained less than 20mg each and one was empty. So from my experience Tara&#039;s dope is far from &quot;cheap&#039; and is actually around twice as much as the most expensive dope listed. <br />I relayed to the vendor that I didn&#039;t feel the transaction merited a 5/5 rating, but if they were fine with an honest review and an overall 4 rating we could just leave it at that and move on. Despite having read my PM,&nbsp; the vendor never responded.

They don&#039;t respond to messages and they NEVER even sign onto their account on Sundays. I guess we will see what happens. <br /><br />Keeping my fingers crossed&nbsp; :-\

				Drago is right. <br /><br />The account may come back, it may not, but for now, contact SR staff. <br /><br />Go to main site. Click on &quot;orders&quot;, copy the order number (tx#) and scroll down to the right corner and click &quot;support&quot;<br /><br />Obviously you want Step 4. &quot;Contact Customer Support&quot; - click that. <br /><br />It brings you to the familiar messaging screen as if you were asking a vendor a question. I&#039;d put &quot;Terabithia Order pending- account gone?&quot;<br /><br />Or something to that effect, as I&#039;m sure they will be on the lookout for that. Include the tx#<br /><br />Hopefully, it&#039;s a glitch or some other issue. Either way. SR will take care of you. That&#039;s what the Vendor Bond is there for. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Chip&nbsp; &nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Good Luck all.

				I opened up a support ticket with SR Support and I got a response within the hour; it said that he had been demoted. Then I got a link to the SR wiki, &quot;what to do if your order does not arrive/is not what I expected,&quot; where it just says wait 10 days then take it to resolution. It also says a refund in a case where a vendor has been demoted will not affect my purchasing stats. Anyways, that&#039;s good news; just a pain I have to wait 5 days to get my money from escrow.. such a waste of time, I didn&#039;t see this coming&nbsp; :-\

				Hey all. I received a message from Tera about an hour ago. It said that s/he had a medical emergency and was hospitalized for several days. They asked what was going on because I sent several messages. S/he also said they would fix the problem today. Thoughts?

Sounds like he&#039;s been going through some tough shit lately. He really was a pretty good vendor. I, too, had ordered from him a bunch of times in the past and they&#039;ve all been perfect.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t heard a peep out of him so I thought he was long gone until I read your post.<br />Please keep us updated if you hear from him again!

				Well I&#039;m glad there are so many caring and forgiving souls here, but personally my heart sank when I read that Tera was keeping addresses and sending out unannounced &quot;extras&quot;. <br />I travel a lot for my job and often place orders off the road from temporary housing when I&#039;m stuck on the road, and it would truly suck if some mystery package showed up in my name after I left. So as much as I would love to get free drugs in the mail. Thanks, but no thanks. I&#039;ll just keep my empty Tera bag as a reminder to stick to the pros in the future. I know &quot;shit happens&quot; but for the most part they don&#039;t want to hear about my pancreas,&nbsp; and i don&#039;t want to know about theirs.

				S/he said they&#039;ll mail my order today and I&#039;ll receive it Monday. Told me the same thing that Juggernog said. That there have been a lot of issues. So, I asked if they would get back to vending once everything calms down. We&#039;ll see what happens.

				I heard from about two hours ago; said he had an emergency and was gone unexpectedly for a few days, but it&#039;s been 2 weeks for me. He said he&#039;d reship today with extras and I accepted his resolution proposal, which extended it for another 3 days (so he has 6 days until the resolution closes and an admin steps in.)<br /><br />What I wanna know is, how is he gonna reship everything? I gave him my address when I ordered, it was marked in transit, then it never showed. Now he&#039;s saying he&#039;ll mail me stuff today but didn&#039;t ask for my address; I wanna know what the deal is, is he keeping peoples&#039; addresses? That&#039;s uncool to say the least..<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;d be sweet if I got a pack from him this week bursting with extras. In that case, I&#039;d be fine with giving him my money that&#039;s been tied up in escrow for two weeks. I wonder if he&#039;ll get his vendors account back and get things sorted out

				I ordered a stamp from her a few weeks back and she sent that with an extra. I have little opiate tolerance. One bag had about 1 anda half the amount of the other. I snorted the smaller one, then hid the other from the old lady. It had such a great rush and i was buzzing so hard that when i had come down and was ready to do the extra stamp she sent i forgot where i put it! Lol Needless to say, i spent at least 2 hours searching through my house trying to recover that missing bag. I finally found it, snorted it, then proceeded to giving in to the &quot;sound reasoning&quot; of &quot;confessing&quot; to my wife because i just &quot;knew that she would be understanding and forgiven&quot;. Man what a buzz to to have actually believed that. Lmfao! All that said, i hadn&#039;t been that high since high school. Thanks for that good shit Terabithia. And as to the order i placed with her the day before her account vanished; it was still in processing, so after contacting SR support i was able to receive btc back into account. I wish her good health. It&#039;s not surprising that she is having health problems, especially if she does the shit too and it&#039;s always as potent as the stuff i got from her was. Hope everybody gets their product or money back.

He has always been quite good in the past and it looks like he even got his vendor account back. <br /><br />Based on what I&#039;ve read on the forums, though, it seems like a number of people have experience with him saying things like &quot;I&#039;ll ship it today/tomorrow with extras,&quot; which doesn&#039;t usually seem to go over well. He said he&#039;d ship mine today with extras, so all I can do is hope that he actually has, despite his past problems with similar promises. Good luck to everyone waiting on the guy

				I heard from him/her about eight hours ago.&nbsp; I ordered from them twice.&nbsp; Both times the packages were shipped out with exactly what I paid for the same day I paid for them and received the very next day.&nbsp; Because of this I left 5/5 reviews and would have given them a 20/5 if I could have.&nbsp; I had some issues with discrepancies between what I was promised and what I got but as I said, I got exactly what I paid for so I really can&#039;t complain.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing, shit happens in life.&nbsp; And in Terabithia&#039;s case, it sounds like there&#039;s a lot of shit happening.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much of it is true and how much of it isn&#039;t and I really don&#039;t care.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they&#039;re trying to scam anyone.&nbsp; I just think they have issues.&nbsp; Issues that are getting in the way of business.&nbsp; Which is unfortunate.&nbsp; Because I like the vendor and I definitely like the product.<br /><br />Sometimes people do things because its what they have to do to get by.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t mean its what they want to do.&nbsp; Just means its what they had to do.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there more than a few times myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure other people here have too.&nbsp; Because lets face it, we&#039;re not buying and selling Girl Scout cookies here.&nbsp; So give him/her a chance to make it right.&nbsp; For myself, I&#039;d order from them again without hesitation.&nbsp; Especially if I knew they were in a bad way.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just stupid that way.<br /><br />:(<br />

				No Sammy i dont believe you expect too much out of people. I mean you buy something and you expect to see it soon that makes perfect sense. <br /><br />I understand that he has and still is going through a shit ton but this is a business transaction thats taken 15 days so far since marked in transit and checked the mail today and still nothing here. This is just a case of bad business. <br /><br />So he lied when he marked it in transit and he lied when he said he was shipping it out on saturday and that it would be here on monday. I know one thing for sure, even if he sends it and it all gets here, Tera has lost my business for good.

				I&#039;d feel slightly better if he at least signed into his account. If he did have surgery, maybe his cut got infected and he ended up back in the hospital. However, one time I was messaging him asking him to track a package for me and he did respond telling me that he was at the post office and would track it when he got home. That leads me to believe that he signs onto his account from his phone. There is nothing stopping him from doing that if he was admitted to the hospital again.<br /><br />All of my ideas are gone. I&#039;m really trying to think the best of this guy but it is really hard for me to do right now.

				Well sammy, what is weird is, I had a mental image myself.. hah<br />What hit me was, what if he was being monitored and we fucked him....<br /><br />He never did come on here and mention his surgery did he?<br />Myself and one other I believe were trying to back him up and keep you all posted why he was delayed. <br />It could have been enough for LE to track him down by city (from recent orders) then hospitals in that city then a specific surgery.<br />would it not? I&#039;m worried. I don&#039;t wish this on anyone, but then I also think what if he OD&#039;d? strong pain killers from a extremely painful and traumatic surgery and whatever else.<br /><br />IDK I hope we did not give out too much information about him..

				I guess so. I hate getting to know someone on the road (vendor especially) and them just up and disappear. It&#039;s happened once already, hope this doesn&#039;t make a second. Always makes me nervous though, cause you never know if they store your addys or still had communications undeleted.

				I don&#039;t think he deleted conversations. When I made my last order, I ended up messaging him our address in PGP and then he disappeared for those few days. When he came back and offered to reship, he asked me if the address in the message I&#039;d sent several days before in PGP was the correct address.&nbsp; :-\

				Don&#039;t you think that if LE busted him there would be some headlines about it? If you&#039;ve ordered from him before, you know what state he&#039;s in. Now don&#039;t go googling all about it, but I haven&#039;t seen anything. Also, if LE caught him, don&#039;t you think that they would&#039;ve done something with the addresses by now? I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the most logical explanation. I think someone made the really good point that, sure, we all want to like this guy. He does seem pretty friendly and he offered a great service. But let&#039;s be honest; he uses his own stuff. A LOT of shit has happened to him within the last few months, and it seems pretty crazy.. even kind of unrealistic. The guy uses his own stuff, what else is there to say? I wish him all the best

				Hey guys, could use some advice.

Go ahead and flame me for the PGP thing, I know; my bad, but I&#039;m working on it!<br /><br />He just asked again for my address after I told him of my dilemma and now it looks like privnote is back up, and there was this other site called certified privnote that never went down.

				He sent me a similar message. His rating has dropped to a (92). Unfortunately, people were giving 1/5 even when they got their $ back. That just seems malicious to me. People seem to only understand giving a 5/5 for a good transaction, and 1/5 if it doesnt go well. There are 3 numbers in between, and i prefer to use them accordingly. I gave a 3/5 cuz I got my money back, but if he makes this up to me ill have no problem changing that to a 5/5. This guy was legit before all this and is clearly trying to make up for it. The rating system is there for a reason, but lets not abuse it and call T a scammer when he didn&#039;t scam anyone. He is losing way more money than any of us making this right and his reputation took a dive. This is probably his job, as it is with many other vendors, or at least a large source of his income. IMO, if u got your money back, u should give higher than a 1/5, but its your decision to make. I just don&#039;t like seeing a good dude get fucked like this because of some unfortunate events. If my stuff comes in ill change my rating and be back here to let all of u know. I wanna see this dude stick around and keep selling to us. I&#039;d also like to see his rating climb back up to a reasonable level. Happy u are back T.

And I can&#039;t speak for the man on that account. But him being a scammer or not isn&#039;t a matter of opinion. It&#039;s fact. He isn&#039;t a scammer. He may have been dishonest, deceitful, and caused alot of trouble for alot of people, but I didn&#039;t see him get any personal gain from the whole mess. He didnt scam anybody out of anything. If he appeared as a scammer before, we are all now well aware that he in fact wasnt scamming anybody, or else he would have had everyone FE and dipped out never to return like we have seen from others. Instead, he is sending us messages and reshipping our packages all at a total loss to try to make up for what happened. While he may not return to his former glory as one of the top h vendors for a while, he is doing what he can to right his wrongs and I think that counts for something. Hopefully he can come to the forums to discuss with all of us what happened and why he was dishonest, and while some of you may be unforgiving and never forget this, some of us are willing to give him a second chance if he is willing to go above and beyond to fix his mistake because I, as well as others I&#039;m sure, enjoy having lots of different options when buying on SR. I think we are past the point of bashing his name, and I didn&#039;t mean to call you out specifically LordEddard, but you were just the most recent one to use the word &quot;scammer.&quot; I really mean u no disrespect and am actually happy for starting this discussion. I&#039;m sorry I came off like such a dick. You have every right to be mad, but he is clearly not here to scam anyone. If he was, then why would be be sending people so many stamps free of charge? Remember that Freeway had a similar experience in May where people were waiting weeks on their orders. I&#039;ve bought from him and quite a few other top vendors (GIA, Subs, SupremeSmoke) and I can say that his customer service is impeccable and he has probably the best dope on the road. Im happy I gave him another chance, but there are still people trying to bash him on the forums when he has a 100 rating. Sometimes it&#039;s worth it to step back, view the situation objectively, and offer forgiveness for a greater reward down the road. I think this is one of those cases, but to each his own. And TB still does have some explaining, or at least owning up, to do.

				I posted this before, however, I feel the need to repost it.&nbsp; Especially considering all the hate being shown this guy...<br /><br />I heard from him/her about eight hours ago.&nbsp; I ordered from them twice.&nbsp; Both times the packages were shipped out with exactly what I paid for the same day I paid for them and received the very next day.&nbsp; Because of this I left 5/5 reviews and would have given them a 20/5 if I could have.&nbsp; I had some issues with discrepancies between what I was promised and what I got but as I said, I got exactly what I paid for so I really can&#039;t complain.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing, shit happens in life.&nbsp; And in Terabithia&#039;s case, it sounds like there&#039;s a lot of shit happening.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how much of it is true and how much of it isn&#039;t and I really don&#039;t care.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they&#039;re trying to scam anyone.&nbsp; I just think they have issues.&nbsp; Issues that are getting in the way of business.&nbsp; Which is unfortunate.&nbsp; Because I like the vendor and I definitely like the product.<br /><br />Sometimes people do things because its what they have to do to get by.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t mean its what they want to do.&nbsp; Just means its what they had to do.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there more than a few times myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure other people here have too.&nbsp; Because lets face it, we&#039;re not buying and selling Girl Scout cookies here.&nbsp; So give him/her a chance to make it right.&nbsp; For myself, I&#039;d order from them again without hesitation.&nbsp; Especially if I knew they were in a bad way.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m just stupid that way.<br /><br />:(<br />

				Hey again; sorry for being so unspecific about what seems off about these stamps. In the past, T&#039;s always sent me really high quality shit but since he was gone I ordered a fourth of a gram from Freeway; it got to me in a timely manner and his communication was really great. His gear was absolutely bomb; a few small bumps got me nodding and it lasted a long time. I&#039;ve just ran out today and so now I&#039;m using T&#039;s stamps he just sent me and they aren&#039;t doing shit for me, they&#039;re just not getting me high. They&#039;re kind of giving me a headache and just not making me feel good at all; the texture is also really off. I snort and when I try to chop it up, it stays clumped together no matter what I do, I can&#039;t even get it into lines..<br /><br />It&#039;s making me super congested like Freeway&#039;s dope didn&#039;t do and it&#039;s like pure white; maybe it&#039;s fentanyl because of the headache and it&#039;s short lasting time? I really don&#039;t know, but whatever it is, it&#039;s some super shitty cut. It&#039;s just really disappointing because T made it up to me and sent me some stamps and they seem like complete bogus. Maybe it&#039;s just me, though.

But he sent me 8 stamps and I&#039;d give you all of them because they&#039;re that bunk. I keep trying them and I&#039;m not getting anywhere. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t Sammy say they got something and that it was good? I&#039;d be curious to know what they got, the stamps that I have are marked &quot;The Majestic&quot; and they&#039;re honestly worthless. It&#039;s like completely cut and giving me lousy headaches, and it&#039;s not getting me high at all. I waited two weeks for this shit product, I&#039;m kinda pissed. I wish he&#039;d just cancelled my order like I asked so I could have just gotten my money back.

				So I had an order get caught up in the whole &quot;account suspension&quot; thing that went to resolution and I got my %100 refund. I hit him up a few days later and told him what happened, said he would send extras to hook me up and I ended up getting 4 stamps of very light brown powder. They were not as strong as I was expecting but being that they were free... I didn&#039;t complain. Since they came through like that out of nowhere, I decided to give them a chance and bought 3 stamps literally a couple hours before he announced that sale. He actually promised to double my order before even announcing that on the vendor page. That was last thursday. I waited until Wednesday to hit him up about not receiving anything and I havent gotten a tracking number or anything. Jugs has the hookup if he is getting tracking from jugs, wish I could get it. But... Since I haven&#039;t been monitoring this thread in a while..... I&#039;ll be updating if anything changes. Good luck all and I hope we all see some bomb ass gear in the very near future!!!!

I hit him up a few days later and told him what happened, said he would send extras to hook me up and I ended up getting 4 stamps of very light brown powder. They were not as strong as I was expecting but being that they were free... I didn&#039;t complain. Since they came through like that out of nowhere, I decided to give them a chance and bought 3 stamps literally a couple hours before he announced that sale. He actually promised to double my order before even announcing that on the vendor page. That was last thursday. I waited until Wednesday to hit him up about not receiving anything and I havent gotten a tracking number or anything. Jugs has the hookup if he is getting tracking from jugs, wish I could get it. But... Since I haven&#039;t been monitoring this thread in a while..... I&#039;ll be updating if anything changes. Good luck all and I hope we all see some bomb ass gear in the very near future!!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually he did send it out, but for some reason there are a few of us that are still waiting including myself. USPS slow week I suppose.<br /><br />Now the tracking thing. I have been dealing with terabithia since he started on the road. I taught him how to use PGP, have spent quite a bit with him, and have a really good friendship. He does not normally give out tracking, but since the beginning I have always requested it, so it&#039;s not even a surprise to him that I still ask for it every order. I am actually waiting for him to get on, My package has yet to arrive and it should have been here today.<br />I&#039;m not to worried about it, as I am stocked up on drugs for the weekend. But still when you expect something to arrive and it doesn&#039;t it is still disappointing.

				Yeah, he also had told me that he shorted my package on accident and put 4 instead of 6 in it and would mail off another one with the rest on Monday. I feel like if something was mailed off Saturday, even Friday, I would have gotten it by now. But idk.... All of my sent msgs are still unread so I&#039;ll give an update when I hear something.

				I&#039;m having the same issues with T. Every order with this vendor has been smooth except this time. I ordered last thursday morning was put in transit the same day. usually takes 3 days priority to the west coast. its now 9 days from it being in transit and no package still. he replied 2 days ago finally on wednesday saying he reshipped on tuesday? reshipped?? how is it that he knew to reship 4-5 days after shipping the initial order? he usually gives me tracking but is refusing by saying its coming. that was yesterday. anyways, just sucks vendors have your btc tied up while you get ignored or just blatant lying of shipping times. this vendor is not being honest when he/she should. customer service is the most important to keep customers coming back. and SR needs to change the resolution rules. shouldnt have to wait 2 weeks or more to get btc back when you know the order didnt go through and there are vendors who will ship in the time frame they state. i could have went with another vendor and have my product in hand. i think im done with SR. just too many options to get scammed or have your btc held in escrow forever. if it comes today i wont change my mind due to T stringing me along. just be honest and do biz as usual. but this time the vendor was not the same on top of it vendor ive come to know. even in his bad times everything went smooth. anybody else having these issues. i see alot of people getting their shit. just cant wait til resolution to be done with this rat race of getting the vendor to reply back with something reassuring. and i have always bought bulk not 1 or 2 stamps. you&#039;d think he would want to keep that coming.

				Just take a look at his discussions. The guy is fucking up and alienating his customers. I have had 2 priority orders in a row that both took over 3 weeks each. After the first time, he sent some extras to make up for it so I gave him another chance. HUGE MISTAKE. DO NOT TRUST THIS MAN WITH YOUR BTC!!! THEY WILL BE IN ESCROW FOR OVER A MONTH BEFORE YOU GET THEM BACK AND HE MAY CLAIM TO HAVE SENT YOU SOMETHING SO HE CAN GET HALF OF YOUR MONEY THROUGH RESOLUTION. BUYERS BEWARE. I will eat my words and take it all back if he makes it right (in a timely manner) but this shit will be legal before I see that happening.

				Well that is disappointing.&nbsp; Tara&#039;s vendor page is gone.&nbsp; All listings are gone.&nbsp; i ordered a few stamps 3 days ago and was wondering why it never changed from processing to shipped.&nbsp; &nbsp;Only issue now is my BTC is still locked up in escro for another 22 hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ordered another few stamps from deluxedelivery a couple days ago and it is still in &quot;processing&quot; as well.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On top of that it looks like deluxedelivery removed the listing for single stamps.&nbsp; only option now is 10 stamps.&nbsp;

				Hello, all. I&#039;m a genuine noob to SR; I lurked and researched et al. for a while before I dove in; pretty standard approach, I imagine. In any event - I&#039;m quite pleased to report that my limited number of transactions to date have been not just positive experiences, but overwhelmingly so. The closest thing I&#039;ve seen to a problem involved - literally - a very minor *clerical error* in one of my orders. I dropped the vendor a note, vendor confirmed my original order [within the hour!] and the rest of my order was in my hands almost before I had time to wait for it. Suffice it to say that the previously mentioned vendor is not only on my preferred list; I also wrote them a stellar feedback to bring down the house. Awesome professionalism on every level. <br /><br />Unfortunately, what finally inspired me to crawl out of the lurker woodwork on the forums was the suspicion that I have run into my first real problem. Yep, think I popped my cherry - huzzah! <br /><br />It being obvious where this is going, I&#039;ll just blurt it out: I placed my first order with T late Sunday evening, opting for overnight shipping. I logged in relatively early this afternoon - roughly 1:30 EST, I believe - and was still able to view both the vendor page and some listings, though it did appear some of the listings had been somehow anonymized or the like. [I.e. Their appearance was outside my limited experience, *snicker*.] At that time, it said that T had last been seen today. I wasn&#039;t pleased to find that my order was still &quot;in processing&quot; but had no reason to expect any issue at that point. I figured I&#039;d give it a few hours and check back...and when I checked back [maybe 3-4 hours later], the listing had disappeared, the vendor page had disappeared, and despite as much intensive searching as a fertile imagination could devise, the only evidence I could find that this vendor ever even existed [outside the memories of other members, &#039;course] was that the identity could still accept a message. <br /><br />Fair enough. I sent a message and a polite one. I&#039;m not inclined to freak out over a problem; we&#039;re engaging in explicitly clandestine activity just being here....let alone actively participating in the commerce side. Problems are *going to happen* from time to time and how they are dealt with separates the pros from the idiots cum sloppy amateurs. Simple enough. I made it expressly clear in my message that I was willing to work with any problems within reason - so long as I wasn&#039;t left out of the loop; I also explicitly requested communication. Well - the grand finish to this cautionary tale is that particular message was sent over 7 hours ago [SR time] and remains unread to the best of my ability to discern. I might be green as wasabi, but all the available facts here seem to add up to the vendor doing a runner.&nbsp; Anyone else have any thoughts on the subject?<br /><br />I have to say that I find it deeply distasteful that my first forum post actually lists concerns about a vendor by identifiable &#039;nym. My inner optimist [to say nothing of my inner child which simply wants my order to arrive in a timely fashion :P] has been holding on to some hope for a positive resolution to this situation for the last few hours. After I found this thread, however, that optimism drained into a well-deserved emotional oubliette. I knew that the vendor had a somewhat spotty history but so far as I could tell from assessing available data, it appeared said vendor had taken acceptable responsibility for those early bobbles in service and the recent feedback record was nothing short of fantastic. [Outside of one complaint regarding inadequate communication, which - apparently - in no way interfered with that particular order being filled in a timely fashion.] I guess I shouldn&#039;t complain; I&#039;m not in danger of losing any money here...but I can&#039;t cancel the order for another 3 days, GRRRR. And I have no real reason to believe it is being filled though it is still listed as &quot;processing.&quot;<br /><br />So, what&#039;s the consensus - if any? Has T done a runner? And if so - is there anything we should do about it? I&#039;m thinking wait and watch for a day or so...I certainly wish no harm or problems to T but perhaps some sort of legitimate issue will indeed explain this irregular behavior...though the disappearance of the vendor page is highly suggestive....

				Addendum to last post - and please forgive me if I have not posted it in the correct thread. Being a forum noob, I&#039;m still limited in where/how I can post and this subject strikes me as relevant to the general discussion in this thread. <br /><br />So - not to put too fine a point on it, but I think it&#039;s fair to say that everyone posting in this thread has some level of interest in the product in which the vendor under discussion specialized. While I realize there is a giant thread elsewhere in the forum - outside of noob reach - does anyone think there might be some benefit to starting a thread - or if possible, a private discussion group [does SR allow that?] - specifically for noobs who wished to share information regarding their experiences with vendors of this particular product? I could wish for such a resource, personally. <br /><br />In the main &quot;non-noob&quot; H-forum, there is a lively discussion of a vendor with whom I had one generally positive transaction and I wish I had the opportunity to add some feedback to a debate that seems to be growing increasingly &quot;lynch-mob&quot; in character. Whether those sentiments are justified or not, I couldn&#039;t say; I simply did not interact with the vendor enough. But I&#039;m a big fan of due process and we have to enact that ourselves here if we want it to operate at all, so...QED. Let&#039;s be fair and try to remember that ethics are all we really have in this kind of a community...a community that we all wish to continue and thrive for our varied personal reasons. Anyway - just a thought. Take care.
