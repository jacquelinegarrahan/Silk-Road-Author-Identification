				A fine country, and I certainly have nothing against it, but being in the US, it would be the last place I&#039;d order from.<br /><br />You might as well just write &quot;Drugs Inside!&quot; in big letters on the package.

				Man, the Netherlands isn&#039;t as sketchy as most people like to think. I mean don&#039;t get me wrong it&#039;s pretty risky but I would venture to say your fine with that Qty. Realize this, even though the Netherlands has drugs legalized this doesn&#039;t mean Americans don&#039;t receive packages from people they know there that are legitimately sending them non-drug items.
