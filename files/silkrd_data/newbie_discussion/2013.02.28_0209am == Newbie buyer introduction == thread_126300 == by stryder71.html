				Hi all,<br />I only recently discovered SR and managed to find my way here all by myself, very proud I am. And absolutely delighted, the choice is endless, where I live I can barely get what I want but on here there&#039;s far more stuff I don&#039;t want than that which I do, and that suits me fine.<br />Took me a while to get things working properly, couldn&#039;t join the forum for the first few days due to an error and I was feeling pretty desperate trying to learn all about and understand BTC and PGP, running Torbrowser and Linux etc. It&#039;s all a brand new world to me, but now I&#039;ve made my first deposit and I&#039;m waiting to receive my first orders tomorrow I&#039;m rather over the moon and feeling really sneaky about the whole thing.<br />It&#039;s a great feeling because for longer than I&#039;ve been around The Man has been trying to control and eliminate the underground market and if they had it their way it would be blinked out of existence in a nanosecond. But they&#039;re wrong to want this type of control, they&#039;re fucking with our freedom to choose, to make our own choices for our own bodies, nobody has the right to take that away from us so I couldn&#039;t be happier that technology finally found a way.<br />It&#039;s a great shame that a vendor was nicked is Australia recently but I can only imagine he got sloppy and let something slip. what ever happened he gave the game away somehow and left them enough to trace back to him (or her, I didn&#039;t read the story so I wouldn&#039;t want to assume). At the end of the day from what I understand every angle is covered on here, no trace of you ever buying anything from here, absolutely no links between the transaction and your bank account, encrypted messages so they&#039;re a one time read only (and if you&#039;re smart and have the option you&#039;ll use a different address that isn&#039;t associated with you) and of course encrypted browsing and a self cleaning OS every time you reboot.<br />Well it&#039;s enough to keep me feeling safe anyway. I thought I&#039;d be nervous about doing something like this and really I&#039;m not. I&#039;m cautious, but not nervous, I feel the internet has done us proud and I couldn&#039;t be happier to have joined such a great society.<br /><br />Peace

				Hey Stryder,<br /><br />Welcome to the SR, it&#039;s unbelievable aint it. I came here looking for good weed/hash and have ended up with all sorts that I wouldn&#039;t normally get. I think it&#039;s just the kid in a candy shop situation and once i get sick of the sugar and the rush wares off i&#039;ll be just using it for weed!! Been toying with the idea of becoming a vendor for when my crop comes in.... but it ain&#039;t a big operation so probably no point. <br /><br />I wish i did a little bit more research as it seems my first order has been a (selective) scam. But subsequent orders and being a little bit more savvy about the whole process have been successful. Rule no.1 i would say is never ever FE regardless, there are plenty of trust worthy vendors who will not ask you to FE even if you a realbrandnew customer ;)<br /><br />Tbh i think we as customers are pretty safe ordering small amounts, I was buying weed from Canada on the clearweb for a year before the quality began too suck big time. <br /><br />Good luck and I hope you have a good experience on the SR<br /><br />

				Hi RBN,<br />thanks for your reply, it feels good to get stuck in with the community. I&#039;m just surfing the forum pages here and getting a feel for the place.<br />Unfortunately I have FE on a few of my first orders, I was sort of going with the flow or more taken by the current and wanted to impress vendors and gain their respect and trust early on. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s no need to worry as I believe I chose my vendors well, ranking quite highly and with many fans and lots of sales under their belts. Still, time will tell.<br />I came here because I overheard a discussion a few weeks ago regarding SR and I was shocked I hadn&#039;t heard of it before. It sort of lay absent in my mind for a week or two then I suddenly remembered and began my research. Within an hour I was signed in, a few days later my account was loaded and now I have some product en route.<br />One big thing I decided to use the market for is good weed because although the stuff we get here is strong there&#039;s almost zero variety but I&#039;ve always been a bit of a connoisseur and had it been wine that became my drug of choice I certainly wouldn&#039;t stick to some 28% Spanish rocketfuel every day so why should I want to smoke the same shit week in and week out. So yeah, this is perfect for me. The prices are a little higher than I pay locally if I buy it by the gram but if I buy a bit more of a stash then it brings the ppg down to a manageable cost. Plus there are some great deals out there as well as samples and freebies, lotteries. It really livens up the drug buying process and adds a little mystery, fun and excitement to it.<br />But the bigger reason I wanted to join was because of the 98% of the drug market I don&#039;t have access to. I&#039;m a bit of a psychonaut myself and although Mary Jane has been my lifelong companion I also discovered early on that I have a taste for the other realms, so I pick shrooms every Autumn (although seasons where I live can be ridiculously unpredictable and not every year is a success) and I&#039;ve dabbled with salvia, mescaline, legal trips, LSA, but I really got into LSD a few years back but that just fell off the market and it&#039;s not like it was before my time when acid was everywhere. People just aren&#039;t interested these days, I know people who want to try and I have a small group of friends who have been looking for her since she went off the market but aside from that it&#039;s all weed and stimulants so, round here there is no supply and no demand. When I heard about this place I was like &quot;Hail all that is good and holy, she&#039;s come home&quot; so I will certainly be getting my fair share of that, but price is tough in small amounts so it looks like me and some friends will be chipping in, buying large and splitting up the stash so we get a good price per tab.<br />For now I&#039;m interested in 25i-nBOME as it&#039;s farrrrr cheaper and seems to have similar effects. I&#039;m a little nervous about trying it (although I&#039;m nervous about taking LSD again after so long a break) but if it makes me feel anywhere near to how LSD makes me feel then I&#039;ll be one happy customer.<br />What I can&#039;t believe is how the mysterious and elusive DMT is finally within my grasp but now I&#039;m staring down the barrel of the loaded gun I&#039;m not sure I want to take the leap. I&#039;ve found out so much more about it in the last week than I ever did. For example I didn&#039;t know that it is practically psilocin just with the part missing which enables it to be ingested and therefore it is described as exactly the same as a very, very, very strong mushroom trip. This is where my fear comes from regarding DMT simply because mushrooms are probably my least favourite psychedelic. A long time ago when I was young and careless me and some friends divided up a mushroom yield from our mornings pickings, instead of dosing we just split it between us and ate it. The effects came on very quickly and I was plunged into a world that on some levels were scary but on others were mystifying and delightful, but I do remember, despite how astonished I was by the overall experience and every little thing within it, there definitely remained a baseline panic and I can imagine me feeling that way but worse (because of the speed of the onset and the power of the drug) a/ if I don&#039;t hit a breakthrough or b/ on the way up to the breakthrough and then I&#039;m scared that I&#039;ll take that fear with me into a place where I don&#039;t even know I exist anymore and the thought of spending what feels like thousands of years or even eternity in that kind of blind panic is just horrifying. I still think I might go ahead, definitely gonna buy it, perhaps test the water first to get a gauge on how it feels, but I do understand that no matter how accustomed you become to the low or sub breakthrough doses nothing can prepare you for a total breakthrough.<br /><br />Anyway, far more information than needed but it&#039;s good to put up my &quot;mission statement&quot; so to speak to kick off my journey along the ole silk road
