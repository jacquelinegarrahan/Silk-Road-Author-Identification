				Hey guys, I have been here a lil over a month and spend ALOT. Needless so say ive have great experiences, And mainly with this vendor.... He&#039;s my domestic coke vendor (AUS). He has beautiful stuff and always comes through for me. I was only ordering grams per time but. Now early thursday arfternoon&nbsp; i ordered a ball.... Needless to say it was triple the amount ive ever spent with him. It usually comes next day after marked in transit... Except once, Once it didnt show up on friday, but surely enough on monday it was here... Ok so he replied telling me my order will be out before 6pm that thursday. I replied asking him if he could send it sooner, he read my message but didnt reply. Of course it was a no show on friday... I kinda expected it. But monday comes..... Nothing..... Tuesday comes..... Nothing.... I message him asking what&#039;s going on as this is first time its gunna take 4 business day&#039;s and i live in next day zone... He finally replies very late that night and says &quot;sorry brother ill look into it i been really busy&quot;. I reply thanks heaps champ and all that shit..... No message back, Waited 4 hours. TODAY (wednesday) NOTHING.... I RECIEVED AN MDMA ORDER I ORDERE&#039;D YESTERDAY FROM A DOMESTIC VENDOR.............&nbsp; Its now been 4-5 working days. He has read some of my messages since telling me he will &quot;look into it&quot; but no reply. I even ordered another 2 grams yesterday with the MDMA...... Should i be worried? I trust him completely and believe he is flat out. So im hoping he just market my order in transit to keep my happy and sent it whenever he had time.... But after today im getting a lil paranoid. Let me know guys.<br />

				Did you FE? If so, you&#039;re at his mercy. <br /><br />Otherwise, just hang tight and try your MDMA and chill for a bit. If he sends it, awesome. If not, you&#039;ll get your refund eventually even if you have to take it to resolution. While it does sound shady, he really may be just super busy with tons of orders or life in general. This ain&#039;t amazon, my brother from down under. <br /><br />Like you said, he probably just marked in transit to try and pacify you for a bit. <br /><br />Good luck!

				actually now it seem&#039;s to say he has only read 1 of my message&#039;s since he told me he would see where my package is... So hopefully he is flat out, Still no answer but !!!
