				Best way I found was putting it on foil, heat it till it glows, you have to get the shit hot, much hotter than heroin. It doesn&#039;t run, just sort of bubbles and goes hard, and just inhale the fumes.<br /><br />I find it a bit like codeine, its quite mild. Nice mixed with Hash I find...<br /><br />Enjoy

				I did the same as you man, a month or so ago I saw the listing for the Spanish raw opium so I ordered .5g too. No stranger to opiates, a recovery heroin addict if i&#039;m honest so should know better really hahaha<br /><br />Anyway, I tried running a bit through my Volcano Vap at 230 degrees first, nothing happened lol I then tried the method of putting it on a pin, heating it red hot, then putting a glass over it and inhaling those, not a great way. I stuck a blob on foil and that seemed the best way! Its still tricky though!<br /><br />I have no tolerance at the moment really, I did the whole .5g in one evening, and was left dying for more. Glad I tried it though, one off the list, personally there are better choices these days, but this is the father of them all really isn&#039;t it, rude not to! Its a pretty mild high if you have taken other opiates, it has nothing on oxyoc man, you went get that level of high smoking it. Its reminded me of taking 100MG of DF118. That warm fuzzy glow!<br /><br />I got some again recently and rolled it into some hash. That was a nice smoke, but expensive hahaha<br /><br />Maybe others with more experience can advise better, an opium pipe from what I read was the prefered way, but even then there is a technique to smoking the stuff, much like H itself :p<br /><br />

				I looked at opium pipes on ebay they were all these 2ft long motherfuckers I thought fuck that!&nbsp; ;D<br />And then there were all these old pictures of China men hundred odd years ago holding similar pipes <br /><br />I love the movie &quot;Once upon a time in America&quot; where he is in an opium den also like you say there are better choices today but they don&#039;t have the history of opium and the history is an attraction to me to try what our forefathers did&nbsp; ;D<br />Chinese people around here need to start reopening opium dens in their food outlets. ;D<br /><br />Well done for controlling your habit and just dabbling now and then too. <br />When I have done an oxy the next day I get a little voice in my head &quot;oh have one today too&quot; but i&#039;m very strict on myself and never do , never done heroin so don&#039;t want those cravings although the fella I knew who had a ten year habit is in good shape now and the ones that went to the booze instead are all looking like shite lol

				Addiction is a complicated issue, what works for me might not worth for someone else. The problem is not the drugs, the problem is me. I&#039;m more than aware of that&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Ive lost over 10 years to addiction for sure, been at rock bottom on H. I cant just take it or leave it, it takes a lot of effort and im always reeling myself back in lol<br /><br />I looked at those pipes too, thought the same ;)

				How hard is it to import opium through Australian Customs? Been told that they&#039;ve recently become more strict, and that plant matter has a really low success rate with the scanners.

The raw opium I got looked a lot like BHO cannabis wax. In fact my girlfriend opened it first and rung me to say some wax had arrived. But it was not wax. :)<br /><br />It does not look like plant matter though that&#039;s for sure! I think you might get away with it

				A few friends and I got our hands on some opium several years ago.&nbsp; I talked to an OG drug user, and got some advice (since it was the first time I had seen opium) and she instructed me to do the following (which worked well.&nbsp; I took a nail with a very flat head on it.&nbsp; Put that on a table sharp&nbsp; side up near the edge of the table.&nbsp; Attach the opium to the sharp end of the nail.&nbsp; I would then light the opium and put a glass above it to catch the smoke.&nbsp; Put the glass on the table, and let the smoke fill the glass.&nbsp; I would then slide the glass to the edge of the table allowing me to insert a bendy straw into the glass without losing the smoke.&nbsp; Then I would simply breath in what I felt like breathing.&nbsp; and not lose the rest of the smoke in the glass.
