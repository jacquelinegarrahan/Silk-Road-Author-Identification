				As I understand it, Tor does not install into Windows like many other kinds of software, as it is designed to be portable. The install file you downloaded would have extracted the program files to a folder, typically in a subfolder named &#039;Tor Browser&#039; in the same location as the installation program you downloaded. For example x:\users\xxxx\downloads\tor browser.<br /><br />You would simply need to delete this folder to remove it from your computer, no additional uninstall is required.<br /><br />But, if you wish to be completely paranoid and hide evidence of it&#039;s ever being on your computer, as some do for safety, you could try using an application called CCleaner, it is a free disk cleanup tool with the option to securely wipe data and wipe free space to make it difficult to recover or find evidence of being present on your disc ;)
