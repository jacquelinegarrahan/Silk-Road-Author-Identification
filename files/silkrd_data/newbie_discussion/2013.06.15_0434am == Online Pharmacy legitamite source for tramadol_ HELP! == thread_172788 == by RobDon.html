				Let me start by saying this does not directly deal with SR but your attention would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I have come to SR forums to ask this question because this forum is full of people who are very knowledgeable about drugs and the internet. <br /><br />Now to explain my situation.&nbsp; I have inflammatory bowel disease and occasionally experience severe pain in my abdomen.&nbsp; This pain comes and goes as my life goes through ups and downs (which seems to be a lot of the time lately.)&nbsp; I have seen doctors, many doctors.&nbsp; I have tried everything they are willing to prescribe. I will not go into detail about this problem but believe me it is a REAL problem. It keeps me from living my life to the fullest.&nbsp; After trying many (atleast 10) different drugs to treat this problem, I have decided that the best answer for me is not to constantly be on drugs, but instead take them only when I need them. <br /><br />After badly burning my foot I received a prescription for tramadol.&nbsp; This is something that I have never been able to get my doctor to prescribe for my IBD pain (I have asked.) The medicine not only took away the pain from my foot, it completely relieved my IBD pain and allowed me to live a more normal life for the 2 weeks worth of pills that I had.&nbsp; While I know tramadol can be addicting, I believe at the frequency in which I would need to take it that it could be the answer to my IBD problems.<br /><br />I want to establish a legal, legitimate source to acquire tramadol so that I am not relying on SR to cope with my problem. I love SR but for this situation I would really like to look for another source. I have heard about online pharmacies that will prescribe and send you drugs. I have also heard about online pharmacies that will send you sugar pills (heard being the key word, I don&#039;t know if this is true.)&nbsp; Does anyone know of an online doctor/pharmacy that can hook me up with a prescription&nbsp; at a reasonable cost? This will be a long term thing. (I live in the US)<br /><br />Any response will be greatly appreciated. Thanks ahead of time.<br /><br />

				Long story short...no.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually shipped from outside the country, and get&#039;s stopped at customs.&nbsp; They don&#039;t try to hide what their shipping.&nbsp; You lose your money and they get their product back.&nbsp; It&#039;s a scam.&nbsp; Why wouldn&#039;t you just buy from SR.&nbsp; Seriously, it&#039;s safer.

				I will buy from SR if I cannot find a legal way to get it. Although my forum account is new I am a long time user of SR and know how truly awesome it is. But I am not giving up on legal alternatives so easily. From what I understand tramadol is not a controlled drug in the US.&nbsp; I have heard about online pharmacies that have doctors who can write prescriptions for drugs that are not controlled. Thanks for the quick response.

				Oh ok, well I guess it&#039;s worth a shot then.&nbsp; Especially if you need it that bad.&nbsp; It&#039;s really up to your better judgement.

				Damn it,&nbsp; I had a shit load of tramadols that I recently that I was doing nothing with.&nbsp; It was one of the worst addictions to get off of so I stayed away.&nbsp; If I find them I&#039;ll give you a custom listing or something if you want.&nbsp; They pass those things out like candy at the V.A.

				Hey, I feel your pain, literally I have been there. Several things come to mind.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to believe that you can not find a doctor for tramadol, but with the way things are going with pains meds maybe it&#039;s more difficult than I realize. Glad I&#039;m not young, for this situation anyway. Have you tried this med that is classified as a &#039;statin&#039; the name is something along the line of this &#039;Chlorestormine&#039; sorry don&#039;t have it in front of me. Point is, it is used in high doses for IBS and has had some great results. It is an inert compound that has no adverse affect on the mind. Anyway if you really do not want the risk of addiction check it out.<br /><br />As for the online pharmacy. Don&#039;t waste your time, because to order the tramadol you will need a prescript and if you find one that does not require it you more likely will be getting something inferior. If you have no other way to obtain it legally then by all means use the &#039;Road&#039;. You will not get fake or adulterated meds and the risk of LE is far less if done properly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck with this I know first hand how devastating obdom pain can be.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Looked around a bit. <br /><br />Try: http://tramadol180rx.com<br /><br />Keep in mind, these companies do not ship to all states. Good luck. And I hope you can find a local dr. to help you out. Saves money and keeps you from pulling hairs out.<br />
