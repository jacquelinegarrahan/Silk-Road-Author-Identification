				You guys know there are other places that buy and sell drugs and gun in the deep web.<br /><br />Here is the Tor directory:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion/<br /><br />You can find people who will sell guns and whatever else in the directory. However, since they don&#039;t have a seller rating or could be a site run by one person the potential for scams are higher.

				Armoury was shut down ages ago. Shipping guns proved itself to be far more difficult than shipping drugs.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;m glad they shut it down, selling drugs to people who want to buy drugs hurts nobody who doesn&#039;t want to get involved. We all know what the guns would be used for though.

				Armory was shut down a long time ago.<br /><br />You can find what you&#039;re looking for on Blackmarket Reloaded though.<br />I warn you though, that place is a steaming pile of shit.

				The Armory was officially closed last year, no doubt about it.&nbsp; The rational was, one platform is enough as it is just to keep it safe and secure and to keep LEO from busting it wide open, so instead of opening up an entirely new &quot;battle-field&quot; or challenge if you will to devote time and resources to, lets just focus on what Silk Road is now and see if we can keep it running along smoothly, as if it&#039;s not already a lot of maintainence in itself already to keep LEO and hackers out.&nbsp; That about sums it up per a posting from Dread Pirate Roberts. <br /><br />Hope that helps. <br /><br />Cheers, <br />Jax
