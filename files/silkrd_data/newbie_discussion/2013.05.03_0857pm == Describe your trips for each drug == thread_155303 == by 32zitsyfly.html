				MDMA=Too good, only a few to couple hours at a time. No one should ever feel that good.<br />Shrooms= Can be great, also can be very scary..eat in moderation, no more than 3-5 grams per trip. Lasts long time.<br />Coke= Silly drug, dont do it. Next to worthless.<br />Heroin= Like MDMA, no one should ever feel that good, only twice as dangerous, and nothing is more addictive. Lasts quite long, if you have light or no tolerance.<br />Oxy&#039;s= meh, for that and that, do Heroin. <br />Tramadol= GARBAGE<br />Morphine= Again, for that, do Heroin.<br />Meth= Dangerous stuff, because, again, its very potent. It gets you very high, for very long, off of very little. Tolerance builds fast, and it can and will easily drag you into a meth addiction.<br /><br />2c-b= Very fun, very mild, quite long lasting.<br />DMT= amazing, very short acting, the FINAL frontier for psychedelics.<br />LSD= KING OF ALL DRUGS, nothing bad, only beautiful goodness, that lasts 8-12 hours. <br />

				Fuck. I had an epic post and lost it. Here&#039;s a shitty version with a lot less drugs and description:<br /><br />Opiates: detached, forced relaxing orgasm feeling. Felt in the body.<br /><br />Benzos: detached forced glee feeling, felt in the heart (my friend felt only homicidal rage, a reaction I looked up later to find was a known symptom of being psychotic)<br /><br />MXE: a cross between booze, opiates and nitrous. Trashed beyond all recognition, but your conscientiousness isn&#039;t clouded, even if you are a bit delerious<br /><br />DXM (4th plateau): you know what it&#039;s like being conscious? Do you know what it&#039;s like being conscious 14 times at once? Well, it&#039;s like that but distinctly dreamy and weirder.<br /><br />2c-b: a forced &quot;holy fuck what an awesome party, i&#039;m having such a blast&quot; feeling. Actually not unlike opiates in some ways, just sort of the other way around. less detached than other drugs I&#039;ve done, but still sort of artificial feeling. Visuals were 100% real, but not of anything interesting. Ripples and stuff in water of my visual field. No little people walking around or anything. less psychedelic than i was led to believe.<br /><br />shrooms (7+ grams): i lost my fucking mind. the world stopped making sense and I have never laughed so long and so hard ever before in my life. My friend would just say something like &quot;reality exists!&quot; and it would be the most fucked-up, absurd idea in the world and it was hilarious. I don&#039;t know if either of us were even making sense or we just couldn&#039;t make sense of what we were hearing.<br /><br />nitrous: you go to nitrous land, kind of like candy land.
