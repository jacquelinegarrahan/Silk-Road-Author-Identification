				buy locally and have deniable plausibility, when you order, take all your illegal things out of your house and hide them at a friends so if it is a Police delivery bust you can say &quot;DRUGS!?! I DONT DO DRUGS!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; and they will search your house, find nothing, and you will have a better chance to fight it in court, also dont be paranoid, dealers have good stealth, and always buy from the high rated vendors so you dont get jacked

				Yeah definitely go with a reputable and established vendor with a good track record, read through his reviews to see what other&#039;s are saying, use your real name. If you can use a friend who&#039;s willing to use his address for a drop off, even better.

				Gioware,<br /><br />It seems you have some worries. Remember, before you do anything, prepare a plan in advance.<br /><br />This plan must include a cover story. The cover story will explain the reason you are receiving mail, and make it sound very innocent. <br /><br />Important, you must rehearse everything you might say if asked by the authorities. Once you have a comfort level and a cover story, you will feel more confident in your abilities.<br /><br />I feel sure you can accomplish this the first time if you prepare and practice.<br /><br />Soon you will be enjoying your order!! Hooray! Enjoy!&nbsp; ;-)-- ~

				Use your real name. You won&#039;t be caught, don&#039;t worry.<br /><br />If you are caught by some freak chance, deny, deny, deny... <br /><br />You don&#039;t know xxxx and you don&#039;t know why they are sending you drugs.<br /><br />Lastly, don&#039;t brag that you ordered from the road, it can be used as evidence later. It Has happened before, and it will happen again.<br /><br />

				To be fair it really is a case of using common sense.<br /><br />There isn&#039;t really much more information anyone can tell you (unless I&#039;m very much mistaken) that&#039;s going to make it safer for you.<br />Do your research on your vendor in the forums, as well as his feedback page.&nbsp; Make sure positive feedback is UP TO DATE - plenty vendors once were good and then turn bad.<br />Dont believe a vendors hype - of course theyre going to tell you their stuff is good and bla bla bla.<br />People say NEVER finalize early and I think that&#039;s a good rule of thumb however some vendors will refuse to sell you without FE if your a noob.&nbsp; So try not to FE (personally there are some vendors Id take a chance on - but for the cautious Id say dont)<br /><br />As has been mentioned, buy locally so customs are cut out.<br />Apart from common sense things like this there really aren&#039;t any magical tips that will guarantee everything goes perfect, but Id say you stand a very good chance of getting what you ordered and not getting busted, buying from a high ranking local vendor with good up to date feed back in forum and on his page. - Good Luck&nbsp; :)

				In the same boat.<br />There has to be an element of trust to get things started.<br />I plan to order very small to start with, a vendir should not ask to FE for a tiny amount, i am sure they can take that risk.<br />I am also reading reviews of any vendor first to see how good their stealth is; that is the best way to stay safe i guess.

				The first thing I might suggest is to never underestimate your adversary. Remember, they are at least as smart as you. The only difference is they have different values and wield a power and authority given them by whichever government you live under. They are on the opposite side of your belief system and will take your freedom. They actually think they are doing a good service. They think they are protecting you and the rest of society by busting you. So take every precaution. I&#039;m fairly confident of the parameters in which I can operate in my country. But I&#039;ve traveled and realize it is much different depending on where you are. There are some countries where drug infractions are punishable by death. And by some of the responses to your question I don&#039;t think members are realizing how serious the consequences can be. So my best advice is to take every precaution. And then you still have to trust the seller. Some countries for example routinely flag anything coming from the U.S. because of cash or political affiliations. So just be careful. Peace.

				found the feedback on vendor not that useful to judge if hte gear is good.<br />Everyone is just posting 5/5 as soon as it arrives, sure they have got their gear, but it could just be crap!<br />If you check the forum then there are usually threads on either hte vendor and their product(s) or general ones like, who has the best ?!?!? now.<br />Also, how do you know the person rating the gear is a first time kid or a 20 year vet?<br /><br />I am planning on using the forum, work out sho the vets are and see where they are buying.<br />just need my post count up before I can contribute to that process!

				That sounds like an idea, only thing you need to do is just wait till both (or whatever count) shipments are at the post office, or somehow otherwise match the delivery dates.
