				Hi guys, just a few beginners questions<br /><br />1) Is using a public computer necessary/recommended when buying the bitcoins from an exchange site (assuming the payment method for the exchange is an anonymous bank $ transfer) ? Or can I do all my bitcoin purchasing, email creation and moving into wallets on my home computer, un-Tor&#039;d?<br />2) Is it necessary/recommended to transfer the bitcoins from wallet to wallet a few times before placing them in your SR wallet to &#039;launder&#039; them in a way? If so, what sites are recommended? I assume I don&#039;t want to transfer directly from the exchange (CAVirtex) to SR. And for what steps should I be on Tor? The wallet switching steps?<br />3) If I&#039;m getting shipments by Canada Post is it likely I will ever have to sign for something? The shipments would likely be a few pills so most likely envelope form.<br /><br />I will only be ordering domestically. <br /><br />Thanks guys. If given the go-ahead I will likely create an account on cavirtex and order some bitcoins, not on Tor, tomorrow.

				1) No it is not necessary to use a public computer to purchase your bitcoins. I mean if you&#039;re using a service such as bitintasnt you&#039;re using you&#039;re real name and going into a store anyways so that extra caution becomes quite redundant.<br /><br />2) You should put them in a wallet like blockchain first just don&#039;t deposit directly into your SR account. You can send your coins to another wallet like instawallet but laundering your bitcoins is kind of unnecessary. You should be more worried about your package getting seized or getting caught with drugs IRL.<br /><br />3) Shipments through the regular mail won&#039;t have to be signed for. You should be informed before ordering if you do have to sign and should only be for priority shipping i.e. next day shipping. And you really should never sign for a package, it&#039;s only going to incriminate you further.
