				Ive had enough of bad quality, cut up drugs around my area so i&#039;ve decided to get on the SR. Problem is i have never done any stealth type transaction before. Is it possible or safe for me to use the local post office&#039;s address for the product to be delivered? or is it safer to deliver to a friends house? Also is it required that i use my real name for it to be delivered to?

				the local post office as an address? do you mean a PO box? if so, a PO box would be safe. a friend&#039;s house would also be okay, but make sure you address it to the person who actually lives there, and make damn sure your friend is ok with you sending drugs to his house first. it isnt required that you give your real name, but getting mail sent to fake names at your address can be a tip-off for the post office that something is not right. many vendors won&#039;t reship or refund if you don&#039;t use your real name and address.

				As long as its a domestic order, ive never heard of anybody getting their packages intercepted. International orders be careful and make sure you research the seller

				Hey 9SCL3. A friends house is definitely the best idea. You don&#039;t really want the staff of the post office seeing you when you go to pick your drugs up. And if you ever get caught having stuff delivered to a real address, you can deny sending for it, anyone can send anyone else anything in the mail. You can&#039;t very well deny all knowledge of the package if you&#039;re picking it up with a huge grin on your face. But good luck with whichever you choose. Also, on purchases, remember, never FE!! Peace man
