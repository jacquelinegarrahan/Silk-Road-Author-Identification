				Was Looking to see who out of the vendors have a product that most closely matches the stuff i have been getting on the street. The Label of my street stuff is escalade and it has an amazing Rush WITH 24hr legs! But i dont wanna be paying the 100$ a bundle that only lasts me a day since i do like 4 shots daily. <br /><br />Now I take 2mg depending on if i have enough heroin of suboxone and when i use i wait 24 hrs.<br />Mindgurus was insanly strong and could make me nod easily BUT i had almost no rush and no euphoria. I would start vomiting and become very very noddy on it. If someone would be able to take the potency of Mindgurus and add the rush/euphoria of BTH you would have a product that would be second to none. Now im not sure what they are puting in the street heroin to make it the way it is. But When compared to mindgurus i could easily tell his was more pure since it was rock and not powder and the fact that 3 bags of my street stuff is about .3 and his was around .05. Im not sure what it is but hopefully this poll will give me an idea and i can test that one out and give a proper review of some #4.<br /><br />Ive learned alot since IV&#039;ing for 8 years. And the heroin that is best is the stuff that is Clear (seethrough) and the darker brown the better. It looks almost like BTH looks when cooked up except this is from #4 powder. <br />This is a poll so i can see who has the best stuff based on IV solution color<br /><br /><br />
