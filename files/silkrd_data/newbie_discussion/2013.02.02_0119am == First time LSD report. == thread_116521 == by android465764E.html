				Tried LSD for the first time&nbsp; few days ago.<br />Thought I&#039;d share how it went.<br /><br /><br />As it was my first time, I bought x2 baby doses (60ug) from a vendor named Subtickle.<br /><br />Did a load of reading first about what to expect. <br /><br />21.30 - Put the blotter under my tongue and kept it there until it started to break apart. Chewed what was left and swallowed it.<br /><br />22.30 - Nothing happened so far.&nbsp; <br /><br />22.45ish - Started to feel some effects. Namely anxiety. Not sure if this is a normal feeling one experiences when using LSD, or due to the fact that I was just nervous.<br /><br />23.15 - Noticing some definite effects now. Anxiety gone, but now feeling some kind of stimulant effect. Maybe some very mild euphoria. Hardly noticible. <br /><br />23.30 - Blinking a lot, for some reason. VERY minor visuals. Put on a Blu-ray to watch.<br /><br />00.00 Definitely peaked at this point. Still feeling a stimulant effect, and now getting some flickering/flashing light effects in my peripheral vision. Focusing on my phone is tricky.<br /><br />00.00 Noticed that my phone appeared to be &#039;breathing&#039;. ie. everso slightly expanding and contracting. Letters on the keys are stretching and shrinking in-time with my breathing rhythm.<br /><br />00.30 - Got up to go to the toilet. Feel VERY useful steady on my feet. Needed to lean on the walls to make it into the bathroom. <br /><br />01.00 - Felt very tired at this point. Patterns on the carpet seems to be exhibiting the same breathing movements. At this point I wasn&#039;t sure if was enjoying it or not. This became a prominent thought in my mind. Sat for a good hour contemplating whether this is fun or just irritating. <br /><br />01.20ish - Blu-ray finished, decided to go to bed.<br /><br />01.30 - Couldn&#039;t sleel, and it didn&#039;t appear to be an option.<br />Closed eye visuals were incredible. In colour, but a bit hazy. As though someone has turned the colour toggle down to like 10%.<br />Listened to Pink Floyd&#039;s The Wall on headphones. This was by far the best part of the whole experience. Closed eye visuals became more vivid while listening to the music. I was seeing kind of ps3 audio visualization type scenes. Pastel colours, swirly patterns, and I was able to almost shape what I saw as it went along. <br /><br />02. 45ish - Winding down now. It seemed that the experience had well and truly peaked. Still felt a bit wobbly on my feet, and now VERY tired. Popped into the bathroom and grabbed 40mg of Diazepam. Was out like a light in no time.<br /><br />11. 00 - Woke up, still felt weird. Not high, but kinda detatched. Opening my post was a laborious and almost depressing event. <br /><br />12. 00 - by midday I felt normal again.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m still unsure as to whether I liked the experience or not. I would maybe like to try a higher does, so I could experience some stronger visuals, but the wobbly motor-skills and on-set anxiety, was something I found rather unpleasant. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				it seems like your trip was pretty short. remember you take higher doses you could be tripping for a long time. you should trip with someone ,go down the woods all day, night something like that. make a fire bring portable&nbsp; radio to listen to some good tunes.

				I agree it was short. But I think the benzos probably had something to do with that...

				Is the on-set anxiety, and the unsteadyness (made up word? lol) a normal thing with LSD? Does it increase with bigger doses?<br /><br />I really disliked feeling unsteady on my feet. It felt like I&#039;d taken a massive dose of diphenhydramine I was so wobbly.

I can imagine how that could also feel like anxiety. But the way LSD works, if you believe it&#039;s anxiety, then it&#039;s anxiety... if you believe you don&#039;t know how to walk, you feel like you don&#039;t know how to walk. If you believe you&#039;re crispy, then you feel crispy, haha.<br /><br />My advice for the next trip: don&#039;t keep track of time.

That does all make sense really. I had no clue what was going to happen, so you&#039;re probably right - I made myself nervous.<br /><br />Convincing myself I couldn&#039;t walk properly, that too sounds right. In-fact, now I think about it, I was so transfixed on my balance that it kinda took over.<br />Mental note made for next time definitely. <br /><br />And finally, yeah... clock-watching now seems like it was a pointless exercise.<br /><br />Ok, thanks folks. Feel better prepared for next time now. ☆
