				You should probably burn down your house, just in case.<br /><br />Pro-tip: Don&#039;t order until you feel comfortable with the process and have properly researched the vendor. It&#039;s OK to PM them with these questions too.

				I mean i did plenty of research and everything and i feel fairly comfortable with everything. I was just looking for some pro-tips just in case if i missed a step or something. From what i&#039;ve seen the vendor has been pretty good, a lot of people have said that the ships within 24 hours and the packages generally arrive with in 48...but i dont know where they live so idk how far they are from the vendor... i was just looking for someones previous expierence so i could know what to expect. P.S. I did PM him he however never responded...but his profile says he has logged in today...is that normal?

				1oz is not really much to worry about - it&#039;s probably going to be fine and arrive 2-4 days after it&#039;s marked in transit. Some vendors mark in transit before actually shipping to throw off LE, others who are trustworthy just do it at night and ship in the morning. USPS priority will be 3 days to almost anywhere in the US, and it it&#039;s more you probably know why already (Alaska, remote location etc). <br /><br />I&#039;ve mailed 1oz before with way less stealth than SR vendors use and a handwritten address. there&#039;s always some luck involved but it&#039;s not really enough to worry about. Keep a clean receiving location &amp; deny deny deny.
