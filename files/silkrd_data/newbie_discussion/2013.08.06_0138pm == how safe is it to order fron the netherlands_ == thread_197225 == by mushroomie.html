				in many posts i read that netherland is a flagged country so i want to ask&nbsp; how safe is it to order some lsd from there?<br />anyone can tell me something?<br /><br />at the beginning of silkroad i orderd many items from nl and everything expect the lsdblotters arrived.i think i got scammed there with the lsd but now there are many star vendors from netherland with very good prices<br />and i want to order from them when its safe.<br />by the way the order where from netherlands to germany.<br />thanks for the replies.<br />greets mushroomie

				Acid is quite easy to conceal IMO... It is a lot easier to conceal than Weed and that still gets through customs&nbsp; &nbsp;a lot of the time! Also, I&#039;ve ordered Coke from the Netherlands in the past and all has been good... A bit of advice though - <br /><br />If you do get a &#039;love letter&#039; from customs, (which is unlikely) do not reply and give them permission to destroy the contents of the package. This is admitting guilt... just ignore it completely. But as I said, this is unlikely... especially with the amount of different methods of stealth shipping drugs.<br /><br />Enjoy.
