				Hey. It&#039;s normal for Vendors to ask First Time Buyers to FE Early. What vendor is this and is his feedback score good?.

				It is normal of vendors to ask to FE but its still risky, you shouldnt because the risk can be getting scammed. hopefully all goes well with you and he/she does have great FB and does send you your order but never FE anymore. good luck. :)<br />

				DONT FE, i dont care if you are a new buyer whatsoever that doesnt mean SHIT! if a vendor makes you FE just go somewhere else i dont give a care in the world if you have zero transactions or a couple thousand you should never FE under any circumstances for no vendors no matter the track record or what.....there are a shit ton of great vendors who will work with new buyers they just ask for you to start with smaller amounts...i rather live with a smaller amount than no amount at all.........and im not trying to scare you at all or anything but that same type of response , please resend your address is one i have seen many of my own buddies get scammed on cause they didnt listen, i hope the order wasnt big and from now on NEVER FE.......i will ask you one more question.....would you ever give lets say $1000 (or you pick an amt) to a total stranger in hopes that they will in return deliver a product, bad idea....and just remember its easy as hell to make buyer accounts too so vendor feedback can be padded with shill accounts and stupid lottery listings.....just a few things i have learned over the time and i want to pass on to all the noobs so you guys dont get screwed cause over the past two weeks there has been a shit ton of scamming and some even by awesome vendors , so nobody is safe, ESPECIALLY once you bypass the escrow system , lol goodluck!

				DON&#039;T FE! NEVER FE! because even in the event that they aren&#039;t trying to scam you, what if you package gets lost or uncovered?....well if its uncovered, you might be kinda screwed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone recently opened a sellers account and their page said &quot;ALWAYS FE&quot; I messaged him and said I like his products but I don&#039;t FE and he said &quot;what do you mean&quot; I said &quot;Your page says Always FE&quot; he said something about a type and change it to &quot;NEVER FE&quot;....i personally don&#039;t know how you can accidentally put &quot;ALWAYS FE&quot; rather than &quot;NEVER FE&quot;, but he changed and I will be giving him a chance. We talked for a while and he seems alright but seeming alright and being alright are two different things.

				Yeh... FE&#039;ing for a top knotch vendor in good faith will even void your refund if the package doesn&#039;t arrive and doesn&#039;t have tracking because they think that people are out to take down their business.&nbsp; The basis is that you FE&#039;d to be able to scam without it affecting your refund rate ::)&nbsp; Don&#039;t FE. There are plenty of vendors who do not require it. Ever...

				So is no &quot;FE&quot; the general consensus on SR? Because I see so many feedbacks saying that they FE&#039;d.

				It is very easy for people like us who have been around SR a long time to scream NEVER FE!!!! at new users, but the reality is there aren&#039;t a lot of vendors who don&#039;t force FE on new users. And those who don&#039;t may not sell what you want, or they may not offer the postage option you want, or [add any number of reasons not to want to use them here].<br /><br />Bottom line is, if I was new here, I would look around for vendors who work with newbs in escrow. If I didn&#039;t find one I wanted to deal with, I would order a small amount of something I wanted, from a vendor I like the look of, and I would FE in the full knowledge that I am risking my money.

				i still wouldnt FE i mean your right i do forget sometimes that people with less than 10 transaction sometimes have it tough with vendors but i mean come on there are vendors out there that work with noobs, there are 5 vendors pages i just read all are able to work with noobs as long as the quantity isnt outrageous, i just would never FE especially with all the scams and if you dont get it but you finalize SR staff cant help you so why take the risk....spend the week or two or whatever it takes to find the vendor that will work with you instead of FE&#039;ing tonight in hopes you get product.....and we all know that noobs get scammed ALOT especially with FE so its such a pain in the ass for them cause they have no real stats or history for the SR staff to take their side especially if you are dealing with an A+ vendor who has been around awhile doing a selective scam to noobs, i just wouldnt do it, but your money is your money , do what you please but if you do get screwed or scammed its not like you werent properly warned
