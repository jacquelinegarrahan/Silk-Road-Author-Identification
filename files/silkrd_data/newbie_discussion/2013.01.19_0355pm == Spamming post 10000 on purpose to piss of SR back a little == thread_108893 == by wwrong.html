				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108854.0<br /><br />We need to get to 50 quickly because asking to forward our thread might take a while or will not be done at all.<br />SR could even simply move that topic to the right subforum to provide some service, instead of deleting post at actual time the chemicals were smoking and we were at the scene.<br />Account creation date is same time. We do not use the forums at all because of sick bastards being on here and having serious doubts about the integrity of SR.<br /><br />We do read. One person posted that ordering from SR is saver than in real life because you actually get what you order and can not be gunned down.<br />Risk on SR is that you can not even see what is really going on/being saved without your consent and (new) vendors have the ability to completely ruin, or even KILL people when and if they want to.<br /><br />After this we feel a lot saver buying on the streets. You can avoid camera&#039;s, come with 2 people and if you feel you need to, search for recording devices. Most dealers are not complete psychopaths though. And taking a lot of risk when selling to new customers. Which is why they sometimes demand introduction by a regular, trusted customer. Advantage is that they get their money immediately. But the prices are fair. On SR people still just list whatever the fuck they want and ask prices that are way too high. And sadly, people are actually so stupid as to buy it, give good feedback and reviews and do not realize they could have gotten 10 times the same amount on the streets.<br /><br />We do not trust SR or vendors anymore at all right now. Hopefully some miracle will happen but chances are 99,99% that will not happen. We will also advice against using SR to buy drugs as it can be very dangerous and lead to people dying.<br />They can raise commission how much they want. Raise vendor prices. They must get a lot of money each day while being untrue to what they claim. They keep a history of past transactions that have been finalized. For a pretty long time.<br />Would be saver to delete them with good deletion software. <br /><br />And maybe, just maybe this has some special forum coding that is required for onion sites. If not then this is the worst forum in dealing with spam that exists. Clear web websites do not have these problems.<br />Perhaps SR pay people to make those spam posts and now take retarded supposedly counter measures in order to seem legit.<br /><br />Fuck this all. Wake up people!
