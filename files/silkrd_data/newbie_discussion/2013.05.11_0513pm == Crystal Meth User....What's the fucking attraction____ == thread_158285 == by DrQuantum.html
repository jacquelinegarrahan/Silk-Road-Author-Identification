				So my missus just showed me a picture of what used to be a girl in the process of giving a blowjob in return for cash for crystal meth. Fuck me, there isn&#039;t enough lager in the world... :o<br /><br />This girl was basically Skeletor in a wig. Fucking horrible. I don&#039;t get it. <br /><br />Maybe some of you living skeletons can educate me?

				Tried meth a few times.&nbsp; Can&#039;t say it was enjoyable, for the most part.&nbsp; Just kind of a tool to stay up for as long as needed.&nbsp; Last time was about 10 years ago, and won&#039;t be doing it again.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t see the attraction in a recreational kind of way.

And I&#039;ve never (yet) used meth, so surprising that your deduction from one forum post was incorrect!<br /><br />I just don&#039;t know how you see one loser and extrapolate that to the entirety of people who use a certain substance. What the hell is your PhD in? Being ridiculously judgmental?

				I asked a former lover the same question. She said &quot;It&#039;s like you&#039;re doing everything that needs to happen yet you aren&#039;t there to suffer the boredom&quot;. To me that says it solves the problem of futile-mindedness and eases the reality of nihilism. In my opinion as a non-user, I think it&#039;s benefits boil down to efficiency and longevity of escapism.

Basically a way to get done what needs to get done without feeling the shameful boredom of your monotonous existence. Feign self-worth by using, if you will, or at least to forget that you actually have little to no worth in the grand scheme of things (nihilism, like the individual above was mentioning). Simply put, it&#039;s a way those individuals found to get through life (likely because they are too weak/too mentally &quot;sick&quot; to do it on their own). Note, I&#039;m talking about junkies here - not the every once in a while type of guy, although methamphetamine isn&#039;t really a once-in-a-while type of drug. You either do it and really like it and eventually get hooked, or you do it and don&#039;t like it and nothing happens. I hope that answers your question. Also, I do agree with the other individual mentioning, &quot;self-righteous potheads.&quot; At the end of the day, you&#039;re all doing the&nbsp; same thing - it&#039;s just that a different drug affects one&#039;s life differently. And you can&#039;t say, if you were in their shoes, that you could have done things differently, because you don&#039;t know their story<br /><br />Hopefully that sheds some light? Although I suspect you already knew and were just asking so you could shoot down any reason one would use to justify methamphetamine use, in the spirit of being a &quot;self-righteous pothead&quot; (if you are one; I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m mainly teasing you).<br />

				Interesting discussion.<br />You cannot use one person as a generalization for all users of a particular substance.<br />However some drugs have stronger physical dependencies than others.<br />Oxcycotin and herion have ravaged my area.<br />Zombied out junkies stealing whatever they can to buy more.<br />Ive never done meth but it seems like a nasty drug.<br />Not judging anybody&#039;s usage though, I believe people have the right to put whatever the fuck they want in their body as long as they are not infringing on anyone else&#039;s right to be free.

				The picture I saw was not the first meth addict I&#039;ve seen and sadly, not the last. The picture did however prompt me to ask why someone would be attracted to dabbling with a drug that can debilitate a person so quickly. I judge no one for taking any drug, however I am of the opinion that if I am curious enough I have a right to ask. And where better than a drug forum?<br /><br />You see, some folks obviously think I&#039;m a cunt for asking, and would rather do poor Tom Tucker impressions or suggest that, because I do different drugs, I&#039;m self righteous. Its easier to attack for some I guess. How dare I, eh? <br /><br />When I started smoking weed, I knew that various smoking related cancers, heart disease, lung disease etc, were all risk factors. I know and understand the risks that come with indulging in my drug of choice. Knowing what meth can do in a relatively short space of time, I simply want to find out what it is about it that for some people it has appeal.<br /><br />And a few contributors to this thread have actually enlightened me with what they understand about meth and its effects. This has helped further my understanding, so thank you for that&nbsp; ;D

Just to elaborate on my interpretation of nihilism - I see it as valid in 2 ways a) it&#039;s acceptance implying unity for all things living and non living and b) as a celebration of the triumphant capacity for achievement in spite of decay.
