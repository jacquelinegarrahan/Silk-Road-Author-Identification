				Trying to get the word out.&nbsp; I placed an order for BTC several days ago using a Reload type card.&nbsp; GGatz confirmed with me beforehand that he could accept my card and that he had he coins.<br /><br />Days later, my order has been cancelled but the Reload card has been activated -- it&#039;s worthless now.&nbsp; This was my first attempt to buy BTC on SR and it will be my last!&nbsp; There was no escrow and therefore I have no other recourse but to out this guy.<br /><br />*IF* this was some kind of mix up and my coins are delivered I will come back and say so.&nbsp; Until then, stay away from GGatz!!!&nbsp; Satisfaction my ass!!<br />

				I almost used this guy but at the last minute I changed my mind and went with Moneyhoney due to the fact that she would accept Moneypaks under $200 without charging a ridiculous rate. I&#039;m glad I did because 12 hours later I had my bitcoins and it seems like this dude is a scammer. Sorry you got ripped by him. Hope you get your money back.

				GGATZ got me for 525. I am in a really bad position now, because that money wasn&#039;t mine, I am piss poor, disabled and trying to put a few dollars in my pocket to cover medical expenses. Now I have a debt I cannot repay.<br />&nbsp;This scum bag needs to be shut down immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;Even if you have not dealt with this character , go to his home page and report him anyway keep SR clean!!

				Almost used him seemed legit just a word to newbies ONLY USE TRUSTED VENDORS!!! If they do not have more than 300+ JUST SAY NO even if they do look around the vendor Walmart is a middle man meaning he takes your money and gets what you need and then send it to you hopefully. Many people have not an will not use him but he has high rating and lots of transactions these are all through his lottery games. I have lost plenty and I will ALWAYS check validity of things before I do them never be in a rush it takes a lot of time to make money but once it&#039;s gone it&#039;s gone for good.

				Apparently even trusted vendors (I think he had over 100 transactions w/ lots of great feedback) will eventually cash in once enough people hand them wads of cash.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty fucked too.&nbsp; Rethinking some options after today...

				For sure he is. I placed an order with him using this user ID, 4 days later nothing. I have messaged him several times I have received no reply.<br />&nbsp;HOWEVER, when I message him using a different used ID he is happy to have me place an order for coin, and replies to my PM immediately.

				My regular bitcoin guy doesn&#039;t take money pak, someone I know had a money pak to exchange so I hunted around for a place to exchange it. GGatz was the only guy who offered to exchange it. Otherwise I would have had my friend use something different

				His VENDOR ACCT needs to be closed ASAP so others don&#039;t get ripped off.<br /><br />Has anyone contacted moneypak? Moneypaks are non transferable and I would assume they could track and freeze funds.<br /><br />IS there any other options besides reporting the vendor?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I hope everyone posting a complaint here, has clicked the &quot;report this vendor&quot; button. <br /><br />20% markup is pretty steep. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been here over a year, and I currently use localbitcoins.com<br /><br />If you have a Bank of America, Citibank, or Well Fargo bank near you, there are sellers there, that have you deposit in their account, and it&#039;s in your wallet within minutes in most cases (FYI)<br /><br />Good Luck all.
