				Hi there, SR!<br /><br />First time caller, Long time listener&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ve been poking around with needles for a short while here (I&#039;ve tried mostly stimulants like MDMA, MDA, Methylone, Cocaine; but have also ventured a Dilaudid or two).&nbsp; I have had marginal success with the point and was hoping to start a &quot;Newbie Needle Support Group&quot;.<br /><br />This is mostly for anyone who can&#039;t talk about needles on the main forums, not necessarily those new to needles.<br /><br />So now that I&#039;ve got a preamble, let me go ahead and get the ball rolling with a question:&nbsp; What&#039;s a fatty with a needle affinity to do?&nbsp; I weigh 210lbs, am 6&#039;1&#039;&#039;, have quite an ample amount of fat and very few visible veins.&nbsp; Are my veins deeper down?&nbsp; What gauge would be best?&nbsp; How should I go about sticking it in? (I know bevel up but from there, I don&#039;t know if it should be up and down, slantwise, from the side of the vein...?&nbsp; How do I know I&#039;ve hit without pulling back on the plunger?)<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a little bit of technical knowledge about needles as well as safety advice and vendors on the road with reliable rigs.&nbsp; If I can pitch in, I&#039;d be happy to but from here, I&#039;m just another Newbie with Needles ;)<br /><br />Thanks, guys, and I hope to see you on the other side of the forums sometime :P<br />~Ali &lt;3

				Everyone has their own preferences as to what kind of pin they like and their technique. I like to use 31g 1 cc short tips, but i&#039;m really skinny. A lot of people like to use a smaller gauge too which would be a thicker needle, but it&#039;s best to try a few to see what you like. Since you said you are a little heavier id go with a longer point. Mine are 8mm or 5/16 in&quot; so id go longer than that. <br /><br />Now technique is just something that will come to you in time, but i guess there are some basics that are universal. Like you said, bevel side up and ALWAYS use a new pin. I used to reuse pins and i regret it now. Not only does it save your veins, but it is SO much easier to hit with a freshie.<br /><br />I think you&#039;re &quot;technically&quot; supposed to go in at a 45 degree angle, but it just depends how long you&#039;re pin is and how deep the veins are. I also try to slide in parallel to the vein and not from the side. Like i said all of this stuff will become so much easier in time and be second nature.<br /><br />You&#039;re going to have to pull back the plunger to make sure you hit there&#039;s really no way around that except when you get experienced you can kind of feel it hit the vein or some times the pressure will allow a tiny bit of blood to register before pulling back. I always pull back to be safe. What some people like to do is pull back right after they break the skin that way when you hit the vein it will automatically register and you don&#039;t have to worry about trying to register while you&#039;re in the vein and sliding out.<br /><br />That&#039;s basically all i can think of off the top of my head to help someone new to IV use. I&#039;m sure i left some stuff out. Oh yeah, rotate sites too. Blowing out your best vein because it&#039;s so easy to hit is such a bummer.

				I have been pondering IVing 4-aco-dmt to see what all the hoopla is about. I&#039;m not too nervous about being able to hit a vein as I&#039;ve had blood drawn nearly all my life some what regularly due to a medical condition and I have quite a few nice big ones at the surface. I am however sketched out about putting a substance I ordered off the internet into my veins directly like that. Any one have any experience IVing 4-aco-dmt? Any IVing tips in general too would be welcome.

It does indeed make your veins &quot;deeper down&quot; since the veins run beneath the fat layer (more or less). If you have a few veins you can hit then treat them very, very well as they don not take long to disappear and you do not want to be poking around through the fat under your skin looking for a vein that hasn&#039;t blown or abscessed. Doing a few push ups or some other vigorous exercise can pump up veins and make them more obvious and easier to use. Also making sure you are in a warm place.<br /><br />When injecting push the needle at about 45 degrees into the top of the vein, the part closest to your skin surface. Make sure the needle is pointing up your arm, towards your heart as this is the way the blood flows in a vein.<br /><br />As for knowing if you have hit the vein or not, just pull back ever so slightly, be very steady when you do this. If you are in, a squirt of blood will enter the barrel and you are good to go.<br /><br />As for size of needle I don&#039;t really know. I just used one size and I can&#039;t remember now.<br /><br />Not many people know this but cooking up drugs, putting them in a syringe without a needle and then squirting it up your anus is JUST as efficient as injecting into a vein. It is a lot quicker and less dangerous too.&nbsp; It may not seem so glamorous or cool but believe me it works damn well and will save you messing up what few veins you can see and wasting your precious drugs.<br /><br />Of course everyone is different and you will find your own method but please be careful.<br /><br />Please be careful. You just don&#039;t know what is in a bag until you inject it and by then it is then too late.<br /><br />There is loads of harm reduction information available on the internet. If your country doesn&#039;t have that look at some UK needle exchange sites where there is all the latest about injecting.<br /><br />My experience: 10 years injecting Heroin and Cocaine.&nbsp; :-\

[no pun intended]<br /><br />I could be completely off on this, so find out what form your 4-AcO-DMT comes in, find out if anyone else is versed in injecting it via erowid experiences and well-trusted forums (like the ones we have here, or bluelight, or drugs-forum.... etc)<br /><br /><br /><br />~~~<br /><br />And to pakchoi and scrolllock,<br /><br />Thank you so much for the advice.&nbsp; Yes, I am going to explore this route further and I&#039;ve gotten over feeling dumb about it (that&#039;s when I made the most mistakes and was no closer to stopping then) and the advice you two have given me has put my mind at ease!&nbsp; I&#039;m&nbsp; going to get to try pure H (trusted vendor, small order, fantastic reviews) and I want to get it right so I don&#039;t make any excuses for myself and get myself hooked on it.&nbsp; One of my vendors is even sending me a rig-kit with all the things I&#039;ve been too stupid to get until now.<br /><br />I have been re-using rigs and it shows (a stick doesn&#039;t hurt until I use an old point, I get more bruises and bumps, I miss more).&nbsp; I haven&#039;t really been worrying about gauge until now but it looks like larger is for me.&nbsp; The small ones just seem to scratch or rip and then I&#039;m left with a false-register or abscess or both.&nbsp; I&#039;m letting my arms heal for now and they should be better by the time my new points come in.<br /><br />Seriously, thanks for the tips, and the biggest one for me was &quot;you&#039;ll get the hang of it with time&quot;.&nbsp; That let&#039;s me know nobody starts off a pro at this and the more I chill out during the act, the more naturally it&#039;ll come to me.<br /><br />Thanks guys ^.^<br /><br />~Ali &lt;3

				Some advice to hit the deep veins easier.<br /><br />Drink lots of water, it increases your blood pressure. Doing some jumping jacks/aerobics to get your heart pumping is a good idea too. <br /><br />Tie off. Use a belt, rubber tubing, bike tire, necktie, whatever... It helps to make your veins more visible. <br /><br />ROTATE! when you find the easy spot, move up and down it a little with each shot. it will make a &#039;track&#039; after a while but it will save your vein. try to be ambidextrous and find that &#039;easy&#039; spot on your other arm.<br /><br />Use the thinnest gauge (higher number) possible. I use 29 or 28 but most people here use 27. Also they have different lengths, i use 1/2&quot; but I think they have longer and shorter. Those are the ones they give at our needle exchange. Oh find out if you have a needle exchange in your city. Here its called Prevention Point (www.preventionpointphilly.org) they should have some links on there and other helpful info.<br /><br />If you&#039;re arms are too fat you can try up by your wrist on the side of your arm or at the base of your thumb joint, where the thumb bone joins the hand bone. Its usually advised to stay out of your hand because of arteries. If you hit an artery when you pull back the blood is bright red instead of deep and dark. With H when you shoot into an artery it burns like hell! but it otherwise didn&#039;t harm me.<br /><br />Um that&#039;s all i can think of for now. Its not a good road to travel when you are a shooter. ALWAYS use new sharp sticks. I&#039;ve reused due to my laziness in going to the exchange and I ruined my &#039;easy&#039; veins, so don&#039;t reuse. If your impartial to shooting over say, snorting, then snort. The more you shoot the easier and more &#039;normal&#039; it becomes and harder it is to stop. I didn&#039;t heed all the warnings i was given and i just wanted to try shooting before i got sober so i wasn&#039;t missing anything and that was 3 years ago! <br /><br />Be safe, be smart, be informed...<br /><br />

				Just make sure that you are safe everyone!&nbsp; You don&#039;t want too fuck yourself up physically.&nbsp; Google Drug Injectors Manual it&#039;s a pdf that&#039;s been put together by a very good harm reduction commitee.&nbsp; You also might want to pick up a vein finder from amazon for a couple hundred bux.&nbsp; And always make sure you filter properly!&nbsp; Have fun everybody! :3
