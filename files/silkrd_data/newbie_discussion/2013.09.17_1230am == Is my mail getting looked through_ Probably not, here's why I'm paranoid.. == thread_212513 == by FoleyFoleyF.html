				I&#039;ve made several purchases here, all domestic. Recently, I made a purchase on Amazon.com that was through a private guy, so it would look identical to the profile of an SR purchase. He claims to have shipped back on the 10th, and provided a tracking number at that time. However, that tracking number has yet to work at all on the USPS website or anything. That makes me paranoid that they&#039;re going through it and checking which is why they&#039;ve delayed the tracking info.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I made a pretty substantial international purchase since that time which has me ever-so-slightly trippin. What do you guys think? Please let me know

				I&#039;ve had tracking numbers not work on the site at all and the package shows up.&nbsp; It&#039;s rare, but I&#039;ve had it happen one or two times, but never domestically, always from a place like India or Pakistan where it shows up on the tracking over there, but then when it crosses over here to the USA it doesnt show up on the usps site for whatever reason.&nbsp;

				if the tracking is for some reason unscannable, ie too much tape or printed incorrectly, you may not receive any tracking information.&nbsp; That&#039;s just one thing out of many it could&#039;ve been.

				Have you tried www.trackitonline.ru? I had a package sent from an obscure European country. Couldn&#039;t find it anywhere on any tracking site but it showed up there.

				&quot;Delivery status information is not available for your item via this web site. A return receipt after mailing may be available through your local Post Office.&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s what it says, btw. No luck on the .ru website either, thanks a ton for the tip though. It&#039;s probably fine considering I&#039;ve never had any problems with shipments before.. I dunno.<br /><br />Has anybody had experiences getting packages from Belgium? That&#039;s what I&#039;m worried about mostly. That this package is arousing their suspicion and then the next one I get, they look at again and then I&#039;m in trouble.<br /><br />Edit: worth noting that this is an all domestic US shipment.

				I think your being unnecessarily paranoid, but than again I guess paranoia is just another word for heightened awareness. I really wouldn&#039;t stress so much though, much worse things have occurred and people got their shit just fine.
