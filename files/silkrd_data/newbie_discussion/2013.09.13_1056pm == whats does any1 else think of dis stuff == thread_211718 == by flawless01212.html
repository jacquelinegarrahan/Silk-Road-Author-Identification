				nBOME is great stuff, incredibly cheap compared to acid and very effective. Was recently made illegal in the uk so now we&#039;ve got AL-LAD and LSZ which are ven better, less side effects and highs indistinguishable from acid!

				It doesn&#039;t have near the safety profile of LSD but, unfortunately, it&#039;s a lot cheaper. Your preference but I&#039;d steer clear

I always get to a point whilst tripping where i think &#039;Thats was nice, but i&#039;d like to be sober now..&#039; and iot just. won&#039;t. end.. nbomes last for ~4-6 hours, bit of a bodyload but still pretty safe when used right

				25i was my first psych and after taking acid, I can see why some people don&#039;t like it.<br /><br />The come up on 25i feels like dying but I find if I eat half a tab, then eat half later into the trip makes it tolerable.&nbsp; While on it, I&#039;ve experienced loss of senses, loss of sense of self--ego death.&nbsp; So imagine when only the consciousness remains while having intense visuals.&nbsp; Then after, you get this euphoric feeling for a few hours.&nbsp; Much more so than acid.&nbsp; Everything is alright with the world.<br /><br />If compared to acid, acid is smooth, gradual, and tapers off.&nbsp; 25i is like a rollercoaster.
