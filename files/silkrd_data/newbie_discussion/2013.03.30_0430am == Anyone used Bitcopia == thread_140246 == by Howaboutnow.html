				I&#039;m curious too, as seems to be the most convenient way for me to buy bitcoins with no written record.

				I just took a look at Bitcopia and it is US domestic only.<br /><br />I think it is more for the sellers so thay can get their profits in cash. So no questions from Tax agencies/Government<br /><br />Does the also exists in the EU?

				&nbsp; I must say with me being new to all this, and not very computer literate Bitcopia is perfect!! I couldn&#039;t figure any of this bitcoin stuff out at first so I used Sugarmama the first time. Then I kept trying to use bitinstant, but it never seemed to work, or was down or something... Don&#039;t have a bank of america in my area.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I tried bitcopia and everything went great!&nbsp; Staff is very helpful too, and very quick response.<br />&nbsp;I used them twice in one day. Strait to my SR address, and BMR address. Coins showed up within an hour both times. I will use/recomend them for now on.<br />&nbsp; Just google the bitcopia &#039;buy BTC page&#039; (that was one confusing part) because if it&#039;s not the &#039;buy&#039; page for bitcopia, it&#039;s just like an idle page you can&#039;t do anything on... Also noticed if you are a slow typer like me you might get your imfo wiped off b4 you can finish the page you need to print because the BTC price changes soo much and wipes out your imfo each time it does.<br />&nbsp;Also, I did pay the .005 btc miner fee for faster service.... Don&#039;t know how much it matters.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But yeah, bitcopia made my day!

				I highly suggest Bitcopia. Very easy and fast depositing of coins. (Only if your near a Wells Fargo) I used to red phone from cvs but bitcopia is my choice as of now.
