				I know one 26 year old white male from Australia and he married a white woman from South Africa. Now, the guy is a good guy and never did anything to harm or hurt her and tried to help her through her psychological issues. She was also suicidal and he talked her out of it. All in all, he was a very good husband to her. She didn&#039;t deserve such a caring husband.<br /><br />So, how does she repay him for his kindness? She leaves him and then tries to ass rape him in divorce court. She just sent him the following letter:<br /><br />Dear Sam,<br /><br /><br />After your refusal to sign the transfer and divorce papers the other day, and your suggestion that I need to hand over the car to you to settle debts, I have consulted with a lawyer from Klimek &amp; Co. Family Lawyers. They have instructed me to write you this letter to outline our options:<br /><br /><br />Option 1:<br /><br /><br />· You will have to disclose all of your assets (Bank statements, Tax returns, Pay slips, investment statements and home contents value) and liabilities (All debts). This needs to be done to estimate your financial situation and capacity to pay me spousal support. Spousal support will continue for the entire time I am studying.<br /><br />· You will also be liable for any and all fees I incur for the time we are settling this matter. This includes all legal, transportation and emotional harm costs.<br /><br />· I will get a court order to get you to sign over the car into my name. (I do not need your consent to do this), you will have to pay the court order fees.<br /><br />· As I fear for my safety since your threats over the last few days I will get a Violence Restraining Order (V.R.O) against you. This will mean that you cannot contact or see me for the specified period of time. The police will also confiscate all of your weapons and ammunition. Violation of this order is considered a criminal offence.<br /><br /><br />Option 2:<br /><br /><br />· You pay me $2000 for psychological distress and fees incurred.<br /><br />· You allow someone to collect the rest of my belongings from your house.<br /><br />· You sign the transfer papers of the car.<br /><br />· You sign the divorce papers.<br /><br /><br />I will appreciate a prompt response. At the advice of my lawyer, you have until Friday of next week (23 August 2013) to take option 2 (this means signed papers, my stuff and the payment). If you do not do this I will commence with Option 1. Starting with the V.R.O.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Leonie

				Time to take out a major cash loan, bury it somewhere, claim you used it all on drugs because of the stress of the break up.<br /><br />Friend of mine was laughing all the way to the bank with that one, the look on her face when she was told the settlement would basically be her owing the bank 36k in shared debt was amazing.

The women who AREN&#039;T BAD are women OUTSIDE of America, in places like Asia, Russia, South America, Africa, etc.<br /><br />The women who ARE BAD are the women in America, Canada, the UK, and Australia. Avoid those women like the plague.

				Oh and by the way. You say it&#039;s &quot;cold hearted&quot; to speak against women and against women&#039;s bad actions.<br /><br />Okay, then it is also cold hearted for you women to DESTROY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEN&#039;S LIVES THROUGH DIVORCE.<br /><br />AND, when I ask women to help me SPEAK OUT against women who destroy men in divorce, not even a single woman will agree to help me.<br /><br />You women are such cold-hearted bitches, that even when tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of MEN KILL THEMSELVES because of how you have treated them in divorce, even THEN you feel absolutely no guilt about it.<br /><br />I have finally arrived at the logical and factual conclusion that women do not possess any sense of conscience, guilt, integrity, character, honesty, or honor, and thus women are the perfect sociopaths.<br /><br />TO all the men reading this? Simply use women for sex and dump them. Women are incredibly evil and will ruin your life if you make the mistake of MARRYING one.
