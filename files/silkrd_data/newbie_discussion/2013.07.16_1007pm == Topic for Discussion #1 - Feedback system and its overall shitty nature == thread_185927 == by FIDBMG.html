				Since I have to keep posting to get to 50, I might as well put out solid topics. <br /><br />First off - how many of you realize and/or agree that the feedback system used is entirely inaccurate and doesn&#039;t allow for buyers to put their honest feedback. <br /><br />If you want to complain about the absolute downswing in vendor quality and precautions, start right here. Giving somebody a 3/5 for using shitty stealth, lying about shipping, and being short by 10% is grounds for blacklisting. How in the name of god do we expect any of the sub 97 ranked vendors to have accurate descriptions of their service? <br /><br />Actually - how many of the vendors period do you think have accurately ranked accounts? I&#039;d love to see the chart showing # of vendors on one axis and the average rank on the other. <br /><br />Most voting systems throw out the bottom and top scores, or at least a majority of them....SR has no option to do anything but give a 1 or a 5. <br />

				More than you know...I&#039;ve had what happens to be 1 confirmed vendor buy to trash my page and what a link someone sends me as another. Both considered to be stand up guys or %100 legit and trustworthy. Definitely need a new rating system.

				Never rely on vendor page feedback. People just mess with shit there. Especially don&#039;t trust those &quot;THIS IS A GOOD QUALITY77!!&quot;&nbsp; product reviews. And don&#039;t mess with trusted vendors&#039; feedback rating. Their fans get really hurt and yell at you. Don&#039;t panic. Don&#039;t do anything. Hide or run away.

				It would be awesome if there were a few standardized ratings for things like stealth, communication, quality etc. in addition to the comment box and we could see a more detailed feedback report than the cluster fuck overall rating. <br /><br />edit:<br /><br />Further thinking: a anonymous weighted overall rating based on number of transactions/money spent the buyer has -- the more you use SR, the more valuable your opinion is. That might make the overall scores a bit more reliable, but would open up new ways to game the ratings.
