				So I transferred around 12 coins to my SR wallet, and right when I had 6 confirmations they were all deducted and sent to another wallet (this particular transaction was around 2,900 total coins from 80+ different wallets including mine)<br /><br />How and why did this happen?&nbsp; I&#039;ve done SR a few times before, but never this.&nbsp; It&#039;s been about 7 hours since I did the transfer, I&#039;ve been hoping that the deduction would not be confirmed or I&#039;d get the coins back...

				Did you see anything strange prior to this happening?&nbsp; Could it be that you&#039;re noticing SR&#039;s coin tumbler feature?&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you saying that an amount went into your wallet, and then were deducted from the total?&nbsp; Or are you just looking at the blockchain info?

				I&#039;m looking at blockchain info, I never even saw the coins on SR itself, I just noticed all the coins I just deposited got transferred out.&nbsp; It&#039;s for the exact number that I transferred into the account as well, leaving the paltry .04 btc I had in there.

				So none of the coins you&#039;re talking about ever actually hit your wallet, correct?&nbsp; How long ago did you initiate the transfer to your wallet?<br /><br />It can take several hours for the coins to show up.

				But have you signed into your account?&nbsp; Have you ever actually SEEN them in your Silk Road wallet?<br /><br />I&#039;m asking to determine whether this is a regular &quot;slow transaction&quot; issue, or if you&#039;re implying that coins were in your wallet and then disappeared from your wallet ...
