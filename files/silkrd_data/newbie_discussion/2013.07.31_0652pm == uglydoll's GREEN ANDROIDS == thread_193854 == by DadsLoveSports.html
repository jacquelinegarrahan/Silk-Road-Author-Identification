				Hi all.&nbsp; I don&#039;t usually post in the forums, but I thought I would keep everyone here updated on my order with uglydoll.&nbsp; His prices for the Androids are the best on SR, but the early finalization is probably scaring most potential buyers away.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been around SR for well over a year now (I rarely use the forums), and I&#039;ve had a great deal of success on plenty of orders, using escrow as well as finalizing early on some when required.&nbsp; uglydoll told me that my order would go out before the weekend, so hopefully I&#039;ll see something within 2 weeks or so.&nbsp; Fortunately, I&#039;ll only be out about $270 if it doesn&#039;t come through, as I only ordered 50 of them to test the waters.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep everyone here updated in case anyone else is interested in one of his listings.

				So, to confirm...you ordered 50 of the most in-demand pills for what amounts to under $6 a piece, which is less than what they cost in bulk amounts directly from the NL, FE&#039;d, and haven&#039;t received anything yet. <br /><br />That doesn&#039;t sound promising.

				I just placed the order 2 days ago.&nbsp; I don&#039;t anticipate on receiving anything for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; uglydoll has a very solid reputation.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t seem like the kind of vendor to run some elaborate scam like, for instance, tony76 did.&nbsp; However, you really never know.&nbsp; Like I said, hopefully everything goes well.&nbsp; I&#039;m just doing this as a favor to everyone so if nothing ends up coming, no one else makes the same mistake.

				Yea, I know it&#039;s definitely a huge risk, but it was one that I was willing to take.&nbsp; Thanks though.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping everything comes through too.&nbsp; I looked around and uglydoll&#039;s prices are unbeatable, that&#039;s the main reason why I went with him/her.

				If the known legitimate vendors with established customer bases can&#039;t sell for close to those prices, why would a vendor without one be able to?<br /><br />Hate to be a hater, but I wouldn&#039;t expect anything.

				HA tony76 wasnt elaborate at all...he simply sold drugs until everyone trusted him and then waited til a sell to really cash in and walked away.&nbsp; That&#039;s scamming 101. The rat bastard still buys drugs surplus and resells them here under another name...make money fast, spend it even faster.<br />Scammers think they are so smart but they just end up being a scammer for life and always trying to hustle with no really peace of mind. It&#039;s easier to just be a straight up drug vendor.

				Uglydoll is a SCAMMER!!!<br /><br />he puts up small H orders to build reputation, and then claims to sell bulk E at low prices. who has actually recieved a package from him?? I ordered 100pieces about 25 days ago and it has not arrived yet, and he claims to &#039;stop selling.&#039; <br /><br />This fool probably cashed out a few G&#039;s from us unsuspecting buyers. Has anyone actually received green androids from him? and what amount?

				People, <br /><br />We&#039;ve noticed Uglydoll has took down his/her listings. This is earlier then he/she said. We from GreenAndroid are here to serve the people who are looking for the genuine Green Androids and future presses. We know it isn&#039;t nice to take away customers but Uglydoll has stated on his Vendor page you should find yourself a new Vendor, we would like to use this opportunity to introduce you with our service and product. We have completed 50 transactions successfully in less then a month and we have 30 transactions in transit. We have also a limited offer: 10 Green Androids for 50 euro.<br /><br />Visit our vendor page, stated in our signature and we&#039;re looking forward doing business with you.<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br /><br />GreenAndroid

We all know drugs in NL are cheaper, because it is made their. Where are you from, another planet? If it is earth, look at your RC prices, everyone can get these RC&#039;s cheaper on the clearnet. Don&#039;t know why you fire at us, we just wanna provide good service and provide the genuine product to interested people. People say they were scammed by UD, we want to show there are still legit vendors on the Road.
