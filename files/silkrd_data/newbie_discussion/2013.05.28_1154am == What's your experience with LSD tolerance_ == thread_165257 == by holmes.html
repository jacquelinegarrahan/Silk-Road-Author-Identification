				My friends and I tripped this weekend. This is like the tenth time I&#039;ve taken LSD and the only time I got extremely ill. I was sick almost the entire time and even ended up throwing up. I think it was because of eating while coming up. I&#039;m not sure what exactly it did, but I just had a feeling it was from that. I never eat and take acid, but one of my friend brought some bread and cheese over and it just looked so god damn good. Anyway... the trip was very disappointing. I rode out the sickness and did feel better about ten hours later and was able to chill, but it still was awful for myself and my friends didn&#039;t have that great of time because of how sick I was.<br /><br />Which brings me to my question. We want to do it again this weekend. That would only be 5 days in-between trips. The reason being is we had been planning it on memorial day weekend for months and it was just hugely disappointing. If we don&#039;t do it this weekend, we have to wait over a month for all our schedules to line up again.<br /><br />What&#039;s your experience with tolerance? Should I take a stronger dose to start? We already usually take a pretty strong one. Three tabs that are supposedly 200 and then a couple later on to boost the trip. Should I take more to start or do you think I&#039;ll have a problem with tolerance from the following weekend? Any advice is appreciated.

				Everyone is going to have a slightly different tolerance, and with the amount that you&#039;re going to take, I doubt you&#039;ll be left disappointed. According to erowid &amp; a casual glance around shroomery.org the tolerance period for LSD is about 3 days, so you should be fine with a week gap. <br /><br />Hopefully next time goes better for you!

				Thanks for the advice. I did do some searches last night on tolerance but I found people said wildly different answers. Some people said 3-4 days others said they should be a month apart. A month apart seems a bit ridiculous, but I&#039;ve never done a trip that wasn&#039;t at least two weeks apart. Five days seems soon, but I&#039;m going to give it a go. Just need to decide to start with 3 tabs again or not. Boosting it by even one tab, seems like a lot!

				If you only take it occasionally you will be fine with 3 days, but if you are going to take it all the time it&#039;s probably best to space it out by a week

				If you&#039;re not sure about it, may as well take the same dose as last time and figure out if you have a tolerance at that stage. It might be handy in the future to know if after 5 days will you still get as tripped out from the same amount.

				Yeah, I definitely don&#039;t plan to do it the very next weekend all the time. Usually, I drop once every month, which works well. I guess my only fear is wasting good acid and not really tripping on it, otherwise it doesn&#039;t really matter.

				Tolerance seems to last about a week for me. I generally wait ten days minimum just to be safe though.

				Yes, eating on LSD is not usually a good bet. Though if you dose on an empty stomach, then hours into the trip need to or want to eat, usually it will be the best thing youve ever tasted,lol.<br /><br />Ive eaten on comes ups or dosed on a very full stomach only to shit or vomit my insides right out. <br /><br />As for tolerance, the grade of LSD you have has a lot to do with it. I notice on very clean, very potent LSD, there is hardly any tolerance build up, though some is always to be expected. Generally though, if your not waiting 10-30 days between doses, its advised that you dose at least double what you typically would from baseline.

				Yeah.... that was my experience as well. Except I couldn&#039;t vomit. I spent six hours of the trip TRYING to. It was a nightmare. After I finally did manage to vomit, I slowly started to feel better and better and then finally recovered totally. Though by that time the trip was over. Ugh. I am going to do it tonight though. I&#039;m eating something light and non-offensive to my stomach at the moment and then I&#039;m fasting for eight hours and no eating until I&#039;ve fully come-up and even though... ehhh I may not tempt fate.

				Judging by your frequency of tripping which seems to be once every while I would say 5 days is ok 7 is better. Ive done so many tests with tolerance and such.&nbsp; I find that tripping multiple times a week you need to at least double your dose.&nbsp; For some reason I trip once a month and my regular body tolerance is so high (idk why, cause I dont take any meds) I end up taking between 1500ug and 2000ug, this is not normal for anybody else, but I guess I am comfortable in that dosage. So in essence, wait a week or double your dose if your going to trip sooner that the week.&nbsp;

				I trip about once monthly. Tripping the very following weekend definitely isn&#039;t normal for me. I came up on 600ug last weekend and then boosted the dose with another 400ug. I really hate to start my trip out on 1,200ug that seems quite strong for most people. Still haven&#039;t decided exactly what I&#039;m going to do.

				Like Lemmy from Motorhead said when he was a roadie for Hendrix &quot;We found out you could trip two nights in a row -you just have to double the dosage&quot; Double down my man- we did it almost every other day one summer ...... But if you are getting sick to your stomach all night , was this everyone or just you ? If more than yourself got sick I would test the stuff, good cid may make you empty your stomach , sick all night doesn&#039;t sound right bro. Sounds adulterated find some family stuff it shows up here once in a while and you wont need three hits of that till week two :)

				I was the only one that got sick, yeah. It was so annoying to my friends, I&#039;m sure. I kept crawling away to the bathroom and laying in the bath tub. For some reason that was the only thing that mildly made me feel any better and I can&#039;t even explain why. This was on Tessellated&#039;s acid which I&#039;ve done many times before, so I don&#039;t think it was the acid. I honestly think it was from eating a ton while coming up. Also, I ate foods that any sober person would probably NEVER mix together. I ate blueberries and goat cheese with chocolate milk. Just no.
