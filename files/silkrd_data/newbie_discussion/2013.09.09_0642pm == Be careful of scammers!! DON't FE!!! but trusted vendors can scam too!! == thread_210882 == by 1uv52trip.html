				I have only been on SR for a few months. I have had 10 transactions with only 2 that had a delivery problem. The first..<br />I ordered a sheet of LSD for a price that seemed to good to be true. The vendor had been in business for over 6 months, which is a factor I used in determining if it was safe. He said to get the sheet, that I would need to FE. I&#039;ve seen everyone say NEVER FE, but the guy made me feel like he was legit..and I did. Well, a good scammer is going to make you want to trust them! Just because someone has been a vendor for months, if they don&#039;t have any recent sales...take caution! I never got the sheet, the vendor kept telling me he would take care of it but now I no longer see his vendor page....$300 down the toilet.<br />Now I was planning a trip to Vegas, and I wanted to trip. So in case i didnt get the sheet, I also placed and order from a highly rated Vendor whom I had a successful order before. The first time I ordered 1 10-strip. This time I doubled the order. Again, first time I had no issues getting a delivery. I copy and paste my home address and name...no fuckup on my side. Well this order never arrived, I got 50% back but when I look at other comments, there were numerous people that never got their order. Now I am out 50% and my stats took a hit for something I wasn&#039;t responsible for...it seemed like they were selectively scamming. I was surprised because this Vendor is HIGHLY rated! There is no magic way to purchase on SR, but right now I am only going to go with a vendor that ships priority or is capable of verifying the order was delivered. I understand there are scammer buyers also! I love Silk Road but you definitely have to be safe and careful or who you trust!
