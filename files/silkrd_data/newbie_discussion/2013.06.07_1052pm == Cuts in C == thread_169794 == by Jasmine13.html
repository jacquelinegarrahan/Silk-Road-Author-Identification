				Question, there is lots of talk about levamisol used to cut C at the manufacturing source. Fuckers. &gt;:(<br />But what is used at street level? I ask bc stuff I got off SR that was &quot;party blo&quot; was decent enough but oh so smooth going up with no burn and very little stuffiness next day.&nbsp; <br />I got some local street stuff and it fkn burns right away, gets stuffy quick and heart is racing. This wasn&#039;t the case w/ SR purchases. So anyone know what might be the cut in my local stuff? I know it could be many different things... but what would cause racing heart, burning and stuffiness? What would be the most likely cut? I wish I could order an EZ test without hassling w/ BC!!! Just run up to corner pharmacy and pick up a testing kit!!

				There is probably some sort of amphetamine in your C, unfortunately there is cut in most all coke these days due to what you said which is that it is added at the manufacturing stage. The only way to have no cut most of the time is to wash with acetone.

				As others mentioned, amphetamine is a likely cut, especially if the coke was very rock-hard. However, it is difficult to determine the exact make-up of your coke without a lab test. <br /><br />Street coke has been likely been stepped on quite a few times, and each hand it&#039;s gone through can add any old &quot;snortable&quot; white powder that resembles coke to add weight.
