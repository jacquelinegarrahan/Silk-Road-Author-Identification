				So I purchased an order on Thursday from a vendor who requires newcomers to finalize early. The order has since been processing and I have yet to see the option to finalize the order. The order was for a special occasion on this coming Friday, so I went ahead and ordered a different product from a different vendor. I have tried to contact the vendor but haven&#039;t gotten a response. Is there any way to cancel this order without having to consult them and if so will I receive full/partial refund? <br /><br />Thank You in Advance&nbsp; :)

				You will get the option to cancel after a certain number of days(I think 4) if the seller has not marked it as shipped by then.<br /><br />If you can contact the seller they may accept the cancellation, but if they ship it within the 4 days then they really do not have to accept a cancellation.<br /><br />That being said most vendors are willing to cancel orders(Even though it happens way more often when the price of bitcoin is going up).

				The option to finalize won&#039;t become available until the vendor marks the order in transit. You will be able to cancel the order if it is still processing after 4 days.
