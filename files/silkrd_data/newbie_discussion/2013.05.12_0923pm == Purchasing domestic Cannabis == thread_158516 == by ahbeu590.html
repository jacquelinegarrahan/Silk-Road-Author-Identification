				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new to the Road. I&#039;ve made 2 orders and have received one. I was wondering how safe domestic Cannabis orders are. The two orders I&#039;ve made were with substances that don&#039;t have a scent. How good is the stealth actually? What do vendors do in order to conceal the smell? I&#039;m just very paranoid of getting caught I guess.<br /><br />Can someone reassure me? :)

				I order all of my bud from the silkroad domestically. I have never lost a package. Just read reviews and see how people feel about their shipping methods. My bud has never been smellable until getting through the first vacc sealed bag

				Different sellers offer different levels of stealth, feedback of seller and transaction history should pretty much give you a hint as to how reliable they are, but I would say that domestic shipping generally has a high percentage of pass rate, so you should not be worried about it much, how many days has it been since it was marked as in shipped?

				What I ask myself all the time is this. &quot;How many times have I had my regular mail confiscated or opened....none&quot; So if I get a regular USPS box why would that one be any more suspicious?<br /><br />I get about a half pound delivered to my PO box every week....no problem

				I actually read one review where the customer was a bit upset ...... the bag was vacuum sealed so tightly that the entire inside of the bag was covered in trichromes and the weed was smashed into a large clump. My point being ...... most vendors selling weed are well aware if the aroma that prevails especially with the high end weed and do their best to ship the safest possible way.&nbsp;
