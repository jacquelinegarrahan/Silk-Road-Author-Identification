				I figured out the SR % from our sales but when you factor in the % from buying bitcoin and all the conversions then withdraws how much do we really make?<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />I make a $100 sale on SR. SR gets $13.50 from my sale. Leaves me with $86.50. Now from this point I assume because there is a fee to ADD bitcoin to accounts there is a fee to WITHDRAW bitcoin? Going off my only known % to add bitcoin it&#039;s 4%. So subtract another 4% from $86.50 = $83.04<br /><br />So if I did this even close to being right after all is said and done for using tor/SR/Bitcoin to move my product I take a 15% ( or so ) lose? I am not complaining and I know prices are much higher for that reason but am i close to doing the math right? Thanks!<br /><br />I also need help with withdraws. I don&#039;t really understand how we get our money/bitcoin from SR account into my pocket.

				There&#039;s no withdrawal fee taken by SR I think so you&#039;re in mistake.<br />Silkroad takes 10% from all purchases so can&#039;t takes 14$ from 100$.<br />You should calculate it once again.

				I was told SR commission was :<br /><br />10% of the first $50<br />8.5% of $50 - 150<br />6% of $150 - 300<br />3% of $300 - 500<br />2% of $500 - 1000<br />1.5% for everything over $1000<br /><br />So my math for $100 should be right because they get $5 for the first $50 then $8.50 for the next $100. I didn&#039;t say SR charged to withdraw but I assume w/e method/ Company you use to get your bitcoin turned back into money and into your pocket they will charge a fee? ( I am assuming this because they charge a fee to turn money into bitcoin ).<br /><br />If you understand this 9 or anyone ) more or se where I am making a mistake can you correct it or give some insight? If i make a $100 sale on SR how much money will be in my pocket when all is said and done and if you have time to explain how to i get the money back? I know how to buy bitcoin i don&#039;t know how to withdraw bitcoin to my bank or a money order?

				It&#039;s not 10% from what i understand. SR gives an example on a $1,016 sale they get $38.74 commission. That&#039;s cheaper than ebay lol

				A few other things to take into account is: <br /><br />Sales on Sr seem to be quite a bit above street $. So you are already getting a premium for your product. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the fees for moving the around are they seem to very depending on the service you use. <br /><br />Of course the benefit you get for anonymous sale is hard to put a price on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just have to research to figure out the best techniques to use.<br /><br />I am sure there are fees as their are with any online service. But I think you will profit ok.

				I agree 100%. The site is amazing and i am not complaining about the commissions at all. i am just trying to do some math to get ready to become a seller. I like to run the numbers so i can set goals and know what to buy and how much ect ect After doing more research ( and your right it may depend on what service you use to withdraw ) on average you lose $20 per $100 each sale. So if you sell $1000 worth on SR you will get back $800 in your pocket when all is said and done. Not bad considering the potential to be anonymous like stated above, move more product than you could unless your sitting on a corner block and even then i think online is prob more and the chances of getting caught are far less if done right. Large dealers launder their money anyway and $800 out of $100 is not bad at all. Thanks for everyone help and if anyone has more feedback please let em know.<br /><br />I did not take into account shipping supplies, Food saver/ vacuum sealer ect ect of course.

				The $13.50 might include/assume BTC hedging.

				What about factoring in the potential from losses by scammers, package loss or interception, etc.
