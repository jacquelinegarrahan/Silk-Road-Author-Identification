				How could DPR use his own name in an email when going under the handle &quot;altoid&quot; what the fuck. Apparently he didn&#039;t even find drugs in his place and he created SR. I am more pissed at this point then disappointed I wonder what he is thinking probably something like &quot;how the fuck could I have been such a n00b&quot; or &quot;maybe I should of consulted someone who knows the meaning of anonymity&quot; . Oh and hi DEA, IRS, Homeland, DOT and DOJ. How you doin? I have a few friends and I that are working on a much safer and secure website atm of coarse it&#039;s in deepnet. Come and catch me if you can hahahah ;)

				And how could SR allow itself to boil down to a single person? If there were a team, one was caught, the others would have back up procedures to ensure we didn&#039;t lose BTC and all other information. Now that DPR has lost, thousands of others have too, and all of the BTC has gone to the US gov. Incredibly sad day for all of us, happy to have the forum to allow others that certain vendors are still around and care enough to look out for their customers I just hope everyone finds a way to the forum okay.<br /><br />Long live this &quot;thing&quot; of ours whatever it is, none of us are going anywhere :)

				yeah man exactly it should be set up like the real DPR that if one is gone it&#039;s passed on. I want it so if I or my cats get caught it will survive as an idea. I am an anon so ideas that live on are my thing. We are legion. :)

				I want something simple and no longer the 8 characters for the title like silk road as it is can easily be abbreviated and remembered. HL(High life) seems perfect it would seem like someone is talking about HL(half-life) easily confused with a game. ;) -DFS&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S. BTW DEA that address I use isn&#039;t the one I am staying at currently it&#039;s my families and they have moved so go ahead and raid it for ordering 25i I dare you.
