				If it was seized by customs how is it entirely the vendors fault? Just wait, claim ignorance if need be, and see what happens.<br /><br />Nothing much else you can do.

And don&#039;t FE until you can work out the issue with the vendor.<br /><br />And depending on which side of the ocean/continent it was seized upon you may want to have a more active approach to how you deal with this. <br /><br />If it was seized on the other side of the ocean/continent then the action you should take obviously won&#039;t be as intense as if it was seized locally.<br />I would clean house until the issue is resolved. Make sure there is nothing at the residence/address you were sending the parcel to that can be used against you in anyway. <br />Also make it so you can remove any ability to have that transaction proven to have originated with you if you have to.<br /><br />If it was seized locally, wait to see if you get a love letter, phone call, knock on the door etc etc...<br />And then its the obvious approach of &quot;Deny,deny,deny..&quot; ; if LE has a warrent they won&#039;t ask your permission to use it.<br />Don&#039;t speak with the police without an attorney present. Don&#039;t give them permission to do anything. Ask them if they have a warrent? if not ask them if you are under arrest, if no, then ask them if you are free to go! You&#039;ve got more important things to do then talk with LE. Say you have a prior engagement that you have to attend and cant sit there and talk all day. It may be a great time to take your gf out on a date, or even do your laundry... ;)<br /><br />Just keep cool, have a healthy dose of paranoia but don&#039;t go overboard. Paranoia isn&#039;t a bad thing in the proper context. Just see how it all plays out. Have steps already planned out for different scenarios. So your not wondering what to do if you get a knock on the door or if you get a phone call from LE...

				For those questioning whether it&#039;s been seized, there was an &quot;EXAMINED&quot; sticker on the outside and a letter from customs inside.<br /><br />And for clarification, the seller&#039;s policy on his page explicitly states &quot;in the event one of my packages gets intercepted, I will offer a 50% refund.&quot;<br /><br />I think I deserve a response after FIVE DAYS of trying to contact him for the 50% refund, especially given that the autofinalize is in three days.<br /><br />Given this additional information, what would the best course of action be?

				You&#039;ll just have to wait and see what his response is. If he&#039;s reputable, and his page states that you&#039;ll get a 50% refund, I see no reason why that won&#039;t happen if you prove to him that it was indeed seized. Some vendors take the weekends off, and most of the top vendors are slammed with messages. I can understand your frustration, but he hasn&#039;t read the messages yet. It&#039;s not like he&#039;s purposely ignoring you.
