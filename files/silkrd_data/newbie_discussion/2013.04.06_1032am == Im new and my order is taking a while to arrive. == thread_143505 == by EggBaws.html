				Hi, this is my first post on the forums. Iv made 5 purchases and waiting on the 6th. What is the first action I take on dealing with my order if it doesnt arrive? Do I ask the vendor to reship? I dont want a refund redlecting badly on my account and would just like the package to arrive. it has been 9 days and still nothing. Tommorow will be the 10th day and they say put your order in resolve after 10 days. Any advice on what to do next will b appreciated. Thanks

				Hi EggBaws, welcome to the joys of SR :) Very glad to hear your five other orders came through, that&#039;s a great start. As to your question it would really depend on a few things; Have you ordered from overseas or domestically? Has this vendor given you a time frame as to when it should arrive? Is it nine days since you ordered, or nine days since it was marked in transit? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Orders can, unfortunately, take weeks to come through. No need to stress right now, I would contact the vendor with your concerns and see what they say. You can place the order in resolution anytime in the seventeen days, and that also includes an option to extend the period in which the funds stay in escrow, but try not to let it auto-finalise. Good luck, AB.<br />

				Thanks for reply, and yes it was overseas. No time frame specified but vendor did message saying holidays for in his region so expect delays. it has been in transit for 9days. I just wasnt sure if Iwas to put my order in resolve after 10 days or I had longer and if i waited longer would it effect outcome of solution. I will wait til monday before I ask vendor for solution. Still hopeful it arrives.&nbsp; Thanks again :)
