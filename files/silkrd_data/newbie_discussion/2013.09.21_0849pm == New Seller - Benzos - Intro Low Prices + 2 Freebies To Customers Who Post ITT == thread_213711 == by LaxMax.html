				I am going to copy/paste my user profile here but here&#039;s a link to the order you can make and earn the freebie on. <br /><br />I am merely trying to build and establish a rep on SR and so will maintain low pricing (I&#039;m basically breaking even) to build some trust here.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/57b9a1084d<br /><br />Hi Guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m Max and am new to SR and came from Atlantis shutting down. As such I will just start out small with low quantity type things, but can fulfill larger orders than are listed with a simple message. Please give me a shot, I&#039;m legit, my product is legit, and my shipping methods are legit. If you have any questions about literally anything just message me. Of course if you have a problem with an order always get in touch with me first to see if we can correct it, I care about building a solid reputation amongst the most elite of sellers here. I want everyone to be happy and everyone to be safe :)<br /><br />- In the beginning I&#039;ll stick to benzos (potent legit ones) and adderall (very limited stock when avail)<br /><br />Here are some rules:<br />- You will never have to FE early with me. If you&#039;re a problematic buyer, then I will refuse the order.<br />- Do not ask for tracking as I will not be providing this.<br />- Since I am sticking to smaller orders in the beginning, my shipping will be stealth USPS 1st class for $3.<br />- I only ship to the US, and have experienced no loss of product so long as the buyer follows the rules.<br />- Refund Policy: I realize problems can occur, but if they are your own fault you aren&#039;t going to get a refund. Otherwise we will take a case by case basis. I want everyone to be happy and so will look to find an amicable solution.<br />- You will NEVER have to sign for any order that arrives from me.<br />- Please keep in mind that shipping times can vary. I will always strive to get any order out within 24 hours, but depending on where you are and how long USPS takes, it can take longer than expected for delivery. Should usually be in 2-3 business day window though once shipped.<br />- When you receive your order please finalize it. No reason to leave orders and coins tied up.<br />- Follow standard address formats. I will literally print the address as I see it.<br />Example:<br />Max Dough<br />1234 Valley Park Lane<br />Beverly Hills, 90210<br /><br />Have fun guys, I hope to provide a solid service and become a trusted seller here.<br />-Max<br /><br />Additionally feel free to comment on my profile/listings/etc. Feedback is always well received even if negative (though I&#039;d appreciate not just randomly being called a scammer because I&#039;m new.)
