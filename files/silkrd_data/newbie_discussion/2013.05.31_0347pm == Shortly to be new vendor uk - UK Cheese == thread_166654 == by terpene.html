				I&#039;ve got some loose ends to tie up in my professional life at the moment with work and shit, but I will ante up the vendor bond sometime soon and we shall test the water.<br /><br />Now I want to be able to gauge the price I charge for my UK Cheese, so I am planning on sending out some samples so that you the buyer can tell me what price you think this weed is worth, I have my own ideas of course and already have some feedback to that effect, both in the &#039;real&#039; world and on alternative marketplaces. I want to be able to take feedback and have some consensus (within reason) on what the stuff is worth.<br /><br />I used to grow for local med clubs here in the UK, but the nature of serious illness means that I have some product available.<br /><br />My question is : <br /><br />Cheese has been hyped to hell and back ever since I can remember and I&#039;ve had this cut since it was sent out from HAZ manor many many years ago. Its a subjective thing, but I do love the smoke. What is the perception of the cheese here on SR. I know some people are selling it (supposedly).<br /><br />Is there a market here for UK cheese?<br /><br />Oh and I&#039;ve never seen clones for sale here or anywhere else - but whilst I&#039;ve known of SR for maybe a couple of years now, I&#039;ve not delved that deeply into the scene. Do thery ever get listed?<br /><br />Enough from me for now : what do people think? Should I limit and send sample to specific people or come one come all?<br /><br />Interested to hear your thoughts.<br /><br />terp

Keep in mind that the $500 vendor bond is fully refundable once the terms of the bond are met making a Silk Road vendor account essentially free.<br /><br />You can read more about the bond here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide#Bond<br /><br />Libertas

				Hi Libertas<br /><br />Yeah I know about the vendor bond, I mentioned it in the first line of the post.<br /><br />I am simply trying to gauge the market.<br /><br />Sorry if I wasn&#039;t clear or was appearing to collect addresses in an underhand way - that will all come soon when I stump up the necessary... ;)<br /><br />terp
