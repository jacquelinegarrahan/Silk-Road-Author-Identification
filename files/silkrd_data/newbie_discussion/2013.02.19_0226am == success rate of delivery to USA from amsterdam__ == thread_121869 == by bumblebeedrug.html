I&#039;ve always stayed away for that reason despite some listings I was interested in.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious to hear from people who have actually tried it as well.

				Don&#039;t know about these days, but 2003-2006 I got quite a few packages from Amsterdam, some very poorly packaged, all of them made it through. I understand customs has tightened up quite a bit on packages from NL.

				I&#039;ve only made one purchase from the NL and it just happened to not show up. <br />I&#039;m pretty sure customs got a hold of it. I would definitely stick to purchasing from <br />vendors from safer countries. All of my orders have been coming out of Germany and<br />I&#039;ve received all of them so far. Then again, when it comes to SR, you win some, you lose some. <br /><br />Good luck with all your purchases.

				Psychoknot speaks truth: when ordering from a domestic source the chances of an intercepted product are almost nil, even with poorly packaged product. I&#039;ve had probably 800-900 domestic packages sent to me over the years without a single lost package, while generally overseas products 1 in 5 were lost, even those with completely legit contents.

				I&#039;ve personally always avoided ordering anything from Amsterdam as in my mind (notice my personal opinion) I just assume that it will be submitted to extra scrutiny or possibly have my address flagged. What are you thinking about ordering? I may be able to help you choose another vendor.

				I had a few orders from the NL come through last year, but the last order from there was seized, and I got a love letter from the Chicago CBP.

				Yeah, what everyone else said. Stuff from NL has a high stoppage rate by customs, and even the FDA. I would not order from there. Interestingly, Belgium, right next door, seems to relatively safe to order from. I prefer not to order from overseas at all, but sometimes, you can&#039;t find what you want domestically, at all.

				From what I&#039;ve heard from others, successful delivery can be pretty spotty. That said, I just placed an order from the NL. I&#039;ll keep you posted.
