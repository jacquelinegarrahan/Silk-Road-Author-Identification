				Hey guys. Another newbie question here.<br /><br />I ordered some coke from an apparently very reputable vendor (100% rating, 300+ transactions) 15 hours ago. I have also sent him 2 private messages.<br /><br />Till now, no reply at all to my messages, and no movement on the order..<br /><br />Could you guys share your experiences and is this considered still to be in normal range for a vendor?<br /><br />Patience is definitely not my strong suite, lol.

				No more than 2 full days usually. Sometimes the same day, most usually the next full one.

				I&#039;ve dealt with vendors who usually respond within a few minutes during working hours, and vendors with whom you have to be patient.&nbsp; Two days should be the most it would take.&nbsp; Does this vendor have a lot of regular traffic?&nbsp; If so, don&#039;t stress, they&#039;ll get to you when they aren&#039;t so busy.&nbsp; This gig can get cumbersome, so vendors do what they can to maximize customer satisfaction (sometimes that means putting off PMs until all orders are taken care of, or limiting how many PMs they will read in a day.)<br /><br />Hope this helped!<br />~ST

				15 hours seems a bit soon to worry and/or send multiple messages...especially if he&#039;s a high-volume vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty new here to, but I imagine that a lot of vendors on the site probably have IRL jobs, lives, etc.&nbsp; Personally, if no mention of response time is given on the listing or on the vendor&#039;s page, I would expect a response time of &lt;3 days.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure a lot of the vendors on here reply much quicker than that, but I can&#039;t see expecting next-day processing from all vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can always check the Vendor&#039;s feedback for &quot;fast processing&quot; or &quot;quick delivery&quot; type comments and get a feel for his average turnaround as well.

				I try to check and respond every 6 hrs, and ship within 24.&nbsp; Lot depends on when the order was made.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/69239ec41b<br /><br />My other offer<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9929148fcd
