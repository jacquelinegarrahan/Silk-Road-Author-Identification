				Go to &quot;Services&quot; on the main SR page.&nbsp; You will find some vendors in there and can check their stats.&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp; :)

				I would just go to localbitcoins to be totally honest. But if you want to do something more anonymous, Id say definitely poke around and look for someone with very good feedback

				Definitely check out local Bitcoins, but if you&#039;re UK I&#039;m selling coins for Ukash vouchers.
