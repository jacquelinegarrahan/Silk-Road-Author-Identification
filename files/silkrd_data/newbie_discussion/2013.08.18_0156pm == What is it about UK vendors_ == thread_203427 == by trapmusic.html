				Hi,<br />I was just wondering why people like UK Vendors better? For example technohippy. His price/quality ratio on tabs is terrible compared to a lot of vendors on SR but still he makes very good business and in general it seemed to me like UK vendors have higher prices... Why is that?

				I believe it&#039;s because most drugs are manufactured outside the UK, so there are more middle-men in the loop by the time it gets to them, so more people taking their cut along the way.<br /><br />Plus the fact the they have already taken the risk of getting the stuff through customs.<br /><br />If you ship from, say, the Netherlands, then the drug may well be shipping directly from the lab/farm/cook-shop so there are fewer mark-ups.<br /><br />That&#039;s my theory, anyway, and I think that&#039;s why the UK dealers do good business with UK customers - there is no risk of customs stopping the package.

				That can&#039;t be it. Obviously that&#039;s why the prices are higher, but I mean why do people buy it then? I mean I&#039;ve had 40+ orders inside EU (most international) and all came so who cares about costums if you live in EU? And Like I said, look at the example of technohippy. He&#039;s definitely also shipping outside UK to many people but his prices are just no good... why do people buy from him? I dont see the point... (the only reason that could make any sense to me is that costums from other countries never check UK packages for some reason, but I wouldnt see why that would be...)

				People see a uk to uk post option as less risk of being intercepted.<br />There is always a bit more risk sent from abroad with customs.<br />
