				As you know as a newbie you can&#039;t post on anywhere on the forum apart from the &#039;Newbies discussion&#039; board until you&#039;ve reached 50 posts. You may wish to post a review to a vendors review page located within the &#039;Rumor mill&#039; discussion board but you can&#039;t as don&#039;t have the privilege to. Some of you have already posted your reviews here, and some vendors have taken the initiative to create their own &#039;newbie review threads&#039; too (which are both great!), however the main source of information of vendors reviews are located within the &#039;Rumor mill&#039;. We feel your frustrations and we want to help you, feel free to post your reviews here and we will transfer them on your behalf to their original vendor review thread within the rumor mill as we believe your reviews deserve to be heard!<br /><br />Here&#039;s the rules:<br /><br />1. Firstly go to the forum homepage and do a search of the vendor to see if they&#039;ve got a review thread, on the rare occasion they may not have one, we can get in touch with the vendor and ask if they&#039;d like one, however if they decline we have to respect their wishes, this would be very rare but it could happen, in 95% of searches you&#039;ll easily locate the vendor&#039;s original review thread.<br />2. You need to write this sentence&nbsp; on your post before you write your review &#039;I give permission for my review of &#039;insert name of vendor&#039;s name here&#039; to be posted to their original review page&#039;.<br />3. We will quote your review to the vendor&#039;s main review thread with a link back to your original post here to prove it&#039;s genuine.<br />4. If you&#039;re a new vendor and would like a review thread to be created in the &#039;Rumor mill&#039; on your behalf please get in touch with one of us via pm with proof you own a SilkRoad vendor account. <br /><br />If you&#039;ve already posted a review here which you would like us to transfer on your behalf please post the link here, and feel free to post your review both in the &#039;vendors newbie review thread&#039; and here if you&#039;d like us to transfer it to &#039;vendors main review thread&#039; as well.<br /><br />That&#039;s it, post your reviews freely (don&#039;t forget to give your permission) and we will take care of the rest. Happy travels everyone :)

				I give permission for my review of LucyDrop to be posted to their original review page<br /><br />there&#039;s been a lot going on in regards to Lucy so I figured I&#039;d give a review of my experience, I started off with a 10 strip order to taste as I was trying out some different acids at the time, arrived in about 10 days, I ate 2 and it was the best trip I&#039;ve ever had, the perfect balance of comfort and intensity, and damn it got intense when it peaked out, my friends that dosed 2 with me agreed, it was by far the best acid any of us had ever eaten, so we got funds together for 50<br /><br />then things got interesting, it took longer than before and people were constantly asking me about it, so I decided to see what I could find out as I was a bit curious myself, allegations of a scam are what I found at first, but found Lucy&#039;s post saying it could take up to 4 weeks and that it will be taken care of if something somehow goes wrong, so I decided to wait it out faithfully, then just today, a few days shy of a month from when marked in transit, it showed up<br /><br />here are some things I took into consideration, there was a bunk batch that had to get sorted out, there was also heinous winter weather during this time so it was probably even worse in canada, I look at it like this...and when I say how good Lucy&#039;s acid is I&#039;m not trying to put down other acid available as there&#039;s some really good stuff out there and everyone reacts to and enjoys different crystals differently...but here is what to me is some really extremely phenomenal acid for more or less like half the price of most of the other stuff being offered, and should something go wrong there is a full reship offered<br /><br />it seems to me that LucyDrop is going above and beyond what they have to and what many others would...again I bring up the more pricey acid that may be of lesser quality with only 50% or less reship, and yeah they require FE, but it makes sense as with such customer confidence incentives there could be scams attempted against Lucy, if they have the confidence in their business and trust in customers to do full reships then customers should have enough confidence and trust in them to FE and not be rude when something relatively simple comes up that needs to get sorted out, not to mention having all those FE funds probably helps those kinds of situations get worked out faster/easier if it&#039;s a matter of restocking<br /><br />I know how easy it is to get antsy about things in the mail, I was really hoping to not have to send Lucy a message saying the 4 weeks was up and still nothing, and I didn&#039;t have to, I suppose they could still be the weak ones but I know what 2 of these should be like and I&#039;ll be testing this weekend

				Thanks for the bump, I was hoping there was a thread like that here.<br />I&#039;m waiting for a visit from Lucy, I&#039;ll be patient before I say anything about it, but thankfully I have something to bide my time and with that...<br /><br />I give permission for my review of Righteous to be posted to their original review page<br /><br />Short review: Great product, great shipping, maybe slightly uneven layering (not significant), and for heaven&#039;s sake only take 1 tab on an empty stomach to start!<br />I got 25 tabs of 25i-NBOMe four days after I ordered them, which is already a good sign.&nbsp; I enlisted one of my friends A to be a &quot;crash test dummy&quot; for the stuff.&nbsp; Friday I gave him a corner tab, then went off to do errands for an hour and come back.&nbsp; When I got back, friends T and D were there as well and A was feeling good.&nbsp; I told them what it was and they both took two tabs.&nbsp; A took a second tab because the first one wasn&#039;t doing much, and I took 1 tab as I&#039;m a lightweight when it comes to substances.&nbsp; We all instantly noticed the foul taste of the chemical.&nbsp; A hadn&#039;t noticed it, so I don&#039;t think his first tab had as much on it, either that or he&#039;s a hardhead.&nbsp; Water later on that night tasted awful.&nbsp; <br />We kept our tabs long enough to take effect (20 minutes) and it took effect hard.&nbsp; D puked twice over the next hour or so; he had eaten a couple hours before.&nbsp; T didn&#039;t eat too much that day, but he still needed to lie down for a bit.&nbsp; A hadn&#039;t eaten nor had I so we were feeling OK.&nbsp; Between pacing around the room, A drank milk to ease his stomach which he says helped.&nbsp; My body temperature dropped so I needed to bury myself in blankets and a jacket.&nbsp; After T&#039;s nap, he came back out and saw intense visual distortions.&nbsp; I saw them too, A to a certain extent, and I&#039;m pretty sure D had no interest in what was going on in front of his eyes.&nbsp; Compared to mushrooms, there was a lot less euphoria, but me and A felt some.&nbsp; We were all able to converse normally, better than on weed.&nbsp; I had a hard time explaining what we took a few hours later to another friend who stopped by.&nbsp; I&#039;m like that on most substances anyway, so it&#039;s no big deal.<br />I expected a lot of visuals with not a lot of mindscrew and that&#039;s just what happened.&nbsp; The body load was more intense than I anticipated, and we all wished we had kept some weed around to ease the load.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do it again alone this weekend, A might, T maybe, D definitely not.&nbsp; &quot;Come back when you get real acid&quot; was the feeling I got from them.&nbsp; Acid isn&#039;t this cheap.&nbsp; For an every-weekend sort of substance, I&#039;d recommend it.&nbsp; <br />Thanks for the service, Righteous!&nbsp; What a great first impression of SR!

				I give permission for my review of&nbsp; Righteous to be posted to their original review page<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95472.45<br /><br /><br />First off if your contemplating the legitimacy of this said fellow quit pondering and make your move his feedback talks for itself! All my orders, placed within the obvious usps time frame, have made it from click to ship to door in 2 days! WITH REGULAR SHIPPING. The level of stealth is unprecedented and very intuitive!! Humm... Quality... no need to speculate on cause its high if i had to guess the 25i-NBOMe is ~99% purity so the minimum is needed if your brain lets it ^_^.&nbsp; By his methods im sensing a bit of oldschool in him so with that being said, to all vendors, SR GET OFF YOUR RUMP AND LEARN FROM THIS PERSON!! His experience speaks for itself!! I just really wish i could shake his hand because Righteous has single handily made this newguys SR experience a pleasant one. Quality, stealth, prompt service, pretty much immediate response to inquiry&#039;s what more could you possibly need?<br /><br />Oh and just recently he posted on seller page of some uneven print we discussed this possible issue and came to the conclusion a reship would be sent. A week was alloted for the blotter to be laid and sent. That was 2 days ago and guess what was in my mail box today! Dunno how he does it or if i even want to know how but damn!<br /><br />Over all 10/5 <br /><br />Nike said it best JUST DO IT!<br /><br /><br />Princess thank you for providing this service most might overlook it but in its own way its very essential to these vendors! GO GAL@!

				I give permission for my review of AlbertHoffman1943 to be posted to their original review page <br /><br />this is a review of my second order from the good doctor, compared to the first time there were some improvements, the shipping was faster and it was vac sealed better, I&#039;d also like to note consistency, these were the tree of life and it was definitely the same acid as the sandoz, however he said this batch was better and I do have to say it came off a bit cleaner/smoother<br /><br />this acid is definitely some really different stuff, but really good stuff, I&#039;ve tried some other acid from the road before and I can see how depending on the head and what they look for in a trip they might prefer some other acid, what I mean by that is that this is some different stuff, there are laughs and good times/feelings but also more of a serious spiritual tone to it, it feels very natural compared to other acid I&#039;ve had, it almost reminds me more of mescaline in some ways, like some mescaline brews I&#039;ve had that were really good and quite acid like, rather than other acid I&#039;ve had that seemed more synthetic in nature that had nice visuals and some mind fuck but mostly just made me want to rave out <br /><br />for me this stuff plays out in waves way more definitively, it comes on and peaks out during the first 4 hours, lets up a bit for a sec and comes back nice and strong for another 2-3 hours, lets up a sec and comes back for another couple hours and then starts to wind down with remaining vibrations/flutters/fractals into hour 12, this acid has also had the most definitive anti-alcohol effects for me, I&#039;ve had acid before where afterwards I didn&#039;t really feel like drinking for a week or so but I&#039;d pick it back up, after the good doctor&#039;s medicine though that stuff is genuinely vile on the taste buds and nervous system<br /><br />I had some kinda funky trips with this stuff before last night, not that they were bad trips but just not as flawlessly smooth as other trips I was having around the same time, but I honestly think a lot of it was my sleep and immune system condition at the time, I also feel like Dr. Albert&#039;s acid had to tune my nervous system a bit before I could fully experience the crystal, I&#039;d say this is probably the most authentic lsd I&#039;ve had in terms of soul cleansing and inducing permanent lifestyle changes, I absolutely love this stuff and gotta say it&#039;s probably the only acid I&#039;m gonna put my money into, based on some other factors too of course<br /><br />Dr. Albert is a righteous dude, not to mention the blotter used is above average quality and the little notes he sends with are lovely :) I highly recommend trying this stuff if you&#039;re thinking about it<br />

				I give permission for my review of AlbertHoffman1943 to be posted to their original review page <br /><br />ate the last of my tree of life on thurs and just wanted give a bump to his thread, I had not tripped for a while...at least compared to the time I was giving between trips before, and it felt even smoother and cleaner this time...I think taking a bit of a break helped tremendously, I have mentioned the waves with this stuff before...well I have realized Dr. Albert&#039;s acid fits that erowid LSD effects/duration chart to a T more than any other acid I have ever eaten<br /><br />there is definitely something special about his stuff, a certain character to it, it seems more worthwhile pre and post peak compared to other stuff I&#039;ve had, like sometimes on other more synthetic feeling stuff it seems like the peak is where it&#039;s at and there&#039;s more of a drop off after it and only feeling like really high on it before it peaks...sometimes I have almost thought I had bunk tabs before it let loose, but Dr. Albert&#039;s acid just keeps climbing in waves as it comes on, there is also more of a constant head space throughout the entire trip<br /><br />now this is only pure speculation...but perhaps the more natural feeling I note with this stuff is because whoever is cooking it is growing their own ergot cultures and doing it completely from scratch vs. the more synthetic feeling stuff starting with the ergot in a more refined state from a chemical supplier, like I said in my last report though...I could see how someone might prefer other acid depending on what they&#039;re looking for, I was a mesc head before I ever touched acid, so that could be why I dig this stuff so much, it&#039;s like when you finally come across a 90%+ sativa authentic old school strain like someone actually took the time and skill to run a 16 week thai haze, you either think it&#039;s the best smoke you&#039;ve ever had or you go back to the kush something or another, I definitely advise trying Dr. Albert&#039;s if you&#039;ve been thinking about it<br /><br />also, I almost pissed myself when I found out he does liquid now
