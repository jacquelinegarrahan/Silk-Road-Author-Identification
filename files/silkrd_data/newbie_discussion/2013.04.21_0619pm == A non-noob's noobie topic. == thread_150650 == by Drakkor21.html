				Though I&#039;m definitely not new to SR or the forums, I have only been a follower of the forums until today. Now I&#039;m a member, trying to get the ball rolling to 50 posts. <br /><br />On another note, has anyone been outside enjoying the lovely weather of the last couple of weeks? I know I&#039;m loving it, and I can attribute at least some of that love back here to SR. I have been a very depressed person my entire life (I&#039;m currently in early my 20&#039;s.) No father, drug-addicted family (i don&#039;t mean users, i mean addicts), suicidal thoughts, blah blah. Not looking for sympathy, just moving toward the point I&#039;m making. Anywho, since joining SR, I have had access to certain substances that changed the way I look at myself. Well not just myself, but everything. I&#039;m sure many can relate to this as well.&nbsp; But I have learned that it is up to me to make myself happy. I must pursue my own life, my own happiness, my own success. No one else will pursue my happiness. Sort of an &quot;eye-opener&quot; in a good way and a bad way. Mostly good, in that I now literally have a new outlook on life, that outlook being that it will be what I make it be for myself. That same truth being true for everyone. I lost my older, and only brother last fall to a lifelong battle with drug addiction, and this is especially hard because I know that his addiction was partly because of the way the people around him viewed him, talked about him, and ridiculed him. &quot;He&#039;s just another junkie, his brain is fried, he&#039;ll never be anything.&quot; He was 36 years old. For the last 7 years of his life, I never told him that I loved him, only to regret that daily now. What I&#039;m getting at, my friends, is that you desperately need to enjoy the things you have in your life while you can. Let another person&#039;s opinion of you change you ONLY if you are bettering yourself, for yourself. And lastly, go outside. Get some sunshine if you have it. It&#039;s beautiful, guys. Have a wonderful day.<br />
