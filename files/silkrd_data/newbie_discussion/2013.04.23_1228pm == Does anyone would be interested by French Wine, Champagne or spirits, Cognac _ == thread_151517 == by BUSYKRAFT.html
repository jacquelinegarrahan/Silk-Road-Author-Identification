				Hi everyone, first of all i apologize if i make some mistakes in english ( not perfect yet (: ) and also if i&#039;m posting in the wrong section..<br /><br />We&#039;d like to know if some people would be interested by French products like Wine ( Margaux, Petrus, Pauillac, or others ) Champagne ( Roederer, Dom Pérignon .. ) or Cognac like for example&nbsp; ( Hennessy, Rémy Martin,&nbsp; Courvoisier, Polignac ... ) or some goods high-taxed in your country. <br /><br />Let us know, and iam pretty sure we could provide you the products at the best price.<br /><br />BK.

				For the moment i cant give you prices, they will depend on many things like quantity, shipping costs ... it&#039;s just a quick &quot;survey&quot; to see if some of you want that kind of product (:<br /><br />Anyway, i can tell you that our prices will be cheapest, cause you won&#039;t pay any duties, but before we have to determine what products are profitable for both sides. then ( i mean soon enough ) we&#039;ll be able to sell on SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />We want to concentrate our efforts on spirits and wine, but if you want other french product high-taxed in your country and you don&#039;t wanna pay any duties and taxes on it ,let us know.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Won&#039;t it be very obvious what is in the package, and customs will seize it until the recipient pays the duty?

				You&#039;re right, that&#039;s why we&#039;re working on it, but one thing is sure, we&#039;ll not sell something who will force the buyer to pay taxes ..<br /><br />There must be a way to send this kind of product without trouble, i&#039;m convinced.

				I am interested in Cognacs.&nbsp; Living in northern Europe.&nbsp; &nbsp;f you simply ship it here, we would have a problem, and customs will surely open my package.&nbsp; You ought to have the russians bring it over because they know how to bring everything here.&nbsp; I dont know how they are doing it though.&nbsp; Im also very interested in the special ones you said you could not get like Hennesy XO.&nbsp; If you are convinced on a way to get your stuff up here, Im sure interested in getting a deal that is cheaper than the tax free boats we have that go in international waters.
