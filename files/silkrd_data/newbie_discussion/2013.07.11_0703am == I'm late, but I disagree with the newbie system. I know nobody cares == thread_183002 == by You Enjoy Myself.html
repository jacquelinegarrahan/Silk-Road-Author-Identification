				I have been a silk road user for over a year and my forum account was made back in October. It&#039;s been months since I logged on to the forums and now I can&#039;t do anything. I can&#039;t even post in topics that I started. <br />I actually agree with the newbie rule, I&#039;m sure it makes sense to everyone. I just wish that some kind of grandfather rule was implemented whenever it happened. Actually I feel stupid for complaining about something that nobody cares about, but I guess I need more posts to make it to the &quot;adult&quot; forums so I might as well.

				I&#039;d rather post 50 times in newbie than have the forums spammed.<br /><br />There is a secondary benefit. Forcing me into the noob area actually forced me to ask my early noob questions here. Now I have a bit more experience I can go to the other forums without asking the same questions all n00bs would be asking.<br /><br />So it keeps the main forums clean of both spam and recurrent noob questions. To be honest I&#039;ve rarely seen forums as &quot;clean&quot; as the ones on this site, so something IS working.<br /><br />Granted it&#039;s annoying... think of it as an investment though.<br />

				well, it does sucks for us below 50 post, but again the 50 posts limits is helping everyone&nbsp; to keep more clean.<br />no worse than tons of spam etc ( i know you say you been member for longer time) but its for everyone anyway, unless it will be changed in the future for some reason

				while i hated it, it did force me to read more posts before pulling the trigger on a purchase, as there were a number of vulnerabilities that hadn&#039;t occurred to me - so many, that i&#039;m going to wait a bit before i do pull that trigger - one thought that occurred from one of the posts, warm weather has got to be worst for generating aromas that dog sniffers will pick up and it is definitely the warm season here north of the equator

				It&#039;s good but as a Vendor I don&#039;t want to have to spam all over the place to get into the main forums.<br /><br />Vendors should be exempt seeing as they&#039;ve already paid to be a Vendor, good money from scammers that way too :)<br /><br />Green Inc

				It does suck. But to avoid phishing/bots I can see how it helps. I don&#039;t feel like spamming a thread to 50 count is the answer though.

				I understand the driver for it, but there must be a better solution. Logging 50 posts here takes forever. I&#039;ve been on here several months and have just passed the half way mark. I have almost as many orders as I do posts, but am still stuck in the newbie pen.
