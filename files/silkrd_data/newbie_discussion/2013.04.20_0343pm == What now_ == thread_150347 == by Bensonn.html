				I just received my order! I don&#039;t wanna open it. I didn&#039;t have to sign for it, and it was my&nbsp; usual mail man. Am i alright to open it today? Or should i wait and write &quot;return to sender&quot; on the package?

				You are likely safe, but you can never be too careful. I would imagine less than 1% of SR buyers go through such precaution, but if you get into the habit of making lots of purchases, then it might be a good idea such as to lower the risk.

				I&#039;ve read about writing &quot;Return to Sender&quot; on the letter/package, but it doesn&#039;t make sense to me. If an item is addressed to you and it&#039;s not open, why would anyone logically write that on something they received in the mail. What am I missing? Maybe this would apply if you had a package sent to another location in someone else&#039;s name and then transported it to your primary location (home).

				The idea with the &quot;return to sender&quot; thing is that if LE comes knocking on your door, you can say, &quot;Yeah, I didnt order this, I was actually going to put it back in the mailbox.&quot;<br /><br />There are lots of precautions you COULD take.&nbsp; Like someone else said, whatever makes you feel good.

				If you&#039;re super paranoid, you could write Return To Sender, then drive towards the post office, and when you get there if no one is following you, you just keep on driving to another location and open it there. But all that is probably not necessary.
