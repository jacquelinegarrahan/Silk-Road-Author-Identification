				^^^^<br /><br />Hey klaunius, glad to hear you&#039;re not too stressed--given that anyone can send anyone else something in the mail--it&#039;s beyond your control.<br /><br />Take BTC4CASH UK&#039;s advice, although, I don&#039;t know whether to ignore the letter part, which is why the reading the forums and getting more advice part is vital.

				of course, of course. Nothing will happen hopefully. But you start to think a lot of weird things, you know?<br />did they track me somehow? i mean, if you think logically they can&#039;t because i always used tor safely and stuff. <br />but maybe i did a fault somewhere somehow?<br />fuck.......still getting kinda paranoid even with my 30yrs. have to laugh about myself a little bit ;)<br /><br />first thought was to ignore it.<br />at the bottom it says something like that my right not to say anything about their blaming doesn&#039;t mean i don&#039;t have to go there.<br /><br />isn&#039;t it maybe better to go there?&nbsp; don&#039;t know if you&#039;re advice is ment to follow in europe or somewhere else. US for example.<br /><br />already checked the forum and read a lot. some questions still come up....<br />thnx for your help so far<br /><br />i mean.....how did they get my name if not from a letter??<br />&nbsp;

				This has to be a joke, or you are the police.<br /><br />If you got a letter from the police, it would clearly state what matter they are writing to you for.<br /><br />They dont just send letters just to check on you and say hello.<br />Government has everyones name&nbsp; (Most)... so that and all your other personal details would not be hard to get.

				Well, I&#039;d certainly be using another address for anything else you may order, but like yourself, I&#039;m new here.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure geography has a fair amount to do with it - if I was in the US, I&#039;d definitely be having a word with a lawyer before hand, and wouldn&#039;t say anything without one regardless of whether you choose to go to them, or in the event they come to you. There&#039;s plenty of great advice here, get your reading and typing chops firing my friend :-)<br /><br />And has been mentioned at least twice before, clean house!

				Yeah FTP! You&#039;re probably safe, especially in EU<br />Asia and America they might have stopped to say hi.<br />Just remember dont give em anything! But if you really want<br />to be cautious just use a different mailing address and/or stop<br />business for a while. Good luck, but i really think you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />The smartest thing you couldve done after getting the letter was come<br />here and talk to people and gather more info!

				I have a lot of experience in dealing with the police, inside and outside of the United States. If they really wanted to get you, they would not send a letter. They know if they scare you, that you will &quot;Clean House&quot; and they will get nothing. They want to get their man, not let him go. The letter is at best, a scare tactic.<br />&nbsp;The police would resort to such a tactic only if they were desperate to make a case and had no evidence otherwise. If they are only sending you a letter, then open it flat, clean your weed on it, grind it down so you can roll one, roll it on the letter, and light up. That is how I would handle it.

				If they had enough evidence to charge you with a crime, you would have gotten a knock at your door and not a letter in your mailbox. I would throw the letter away, clean up my house of goods and not ship anything to that location again.<br /><br />I have heard of people getting a letter saying something was confiscated as contraband. It was always small amounts of drugs though.

				I have received a letter, just get another address. The letter I got was from the US Border Patrol they took a gram of MDMA. No Love from those fuckers. If your having Federal Felonies mailed to you regularly, then they may show up ans serve you a letter from the court called a Search Warrant, and/or Warrant of Arrest, after they catch you with a controlled drop.<br />&nbsp;Just have a super soaker nearby with DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) and Atropine, spray the fuckers down, they will hallucinating in no time, and rendered unable to function for at least 10 hours. Then you can clean house :)
