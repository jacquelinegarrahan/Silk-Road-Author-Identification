				Hello all, before&nbsp; I said PLEASE do not reply with &quot;DONT DO IT&quot; or &quot;YOUR TO YOUNG&quot; and all that bullshit. <br />I am 15 and want to try crystal meth. I have smoked pot, and pot laced with crack a few times. My best friend (also 15) got some meth from a user, she took it from his house. We are looking to smoke it tonight or tomorrow. We asked around on some other non-onion places about how to do it, but all we got was the same old shit, they dont do it talk. We are going to do it but would like to talk to someone that has done it. Talk I mean email (paramoregirl@tormail.com) or here. We are not 100% how to smoke it, Hollie has an idea. Second, we like to know the side effects, what happens when you come down? We plan to do it in her bedroom and her parents are downstairs? Should we go outside? Will it smell up the place? We have lots of questions. Please reply or email. Dont give us &#039;your to young&#039; shit. We know that, its just for kicks, this one time. THANK YOU

				good , clean meth is not horribly bad for you trying it once or twice. it lasts a long time and there is a reasonably uncomfortable coming down which leads to just re-dosing and staying up longer, which becomes a problem and makes coming down even worse when you are out.&nbsp; but after that it becomes a matter of your neurotransmitter levels becoming unbalanced due to the fact that at your age your brain is still developing and learning what &quot;normal&quot; is. <br /><br />Not to say it will ruin your brain forever with a few uses, but extended use WILL ( 100% absolutely will) cause differences in the way your brain processes the chemicals associated with manageable moods, happiness and stress..<br /><br />Its a fun drug, but shit, you have plenty of time to do drugs and trust me, no one will think you are cool for having meth off your bucket list at 15. <br /><br />Good luck either way, just put it on an aluminum&nbsp; foil boat and lightly roast it with a lighter from underneath using a straw or other tube to inhale. <br /><br />

				thanks, ALA, should we do it out of the house? Does it have a strong odor? Again we stole this and changes of us getting more is low so even if we like it, i dont see it getting hooked cause we could only do it once every few months but its more of less try it cause we have it. I dont believe my health teacher, i dont think one time will hook us for life. lol <br /><br />its not really that shocking at my age, i know others that do or done it at school or harder stuff. I think some old people forget what its like being a teen and that is when people try stuff. <br />

				***don&#039;t do it.***<br /><br />sorry I know you said you didn&#039;t want to hear that but you know what it&#039;s great advice.&nbsp; once you do it you&#039;ll be tweaked for 24 hours at least and it will be obvious to those that normally don&#039;t see you high on it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll let others in the forums explain how to do it if you still insist on it.

				The reason you are getting warnings is because of the information you&#039;ve given us so far.&nbsp; Being your age living at home still is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp; Most tweakers that are able to continue doing this drug live with other tweakers or on their own and have time to be high in a secluded environment or with other tweakers.&nbsp; The last thing you want to be doing is tweaking in your parent&#039;s house wondering if they&#039;re outside your bedroom listening to you light your lighter to take your next hit.<br /><br />What will you see?&nbsp; Usually nothing, but some people have described seeing &quot;shadow people&quot;.&nbsp; Google it.&nbsp; What does it feel like?&nbsp; It&#039;s something like coke except it lasts around 12-24 hours and generally you don&#039;t feel the need to smoke it every 5 minutes until you run out.&nbsp; There is a reason people smoke it every day and it&#039;s a big decision to do it your first time.&nbsp; Many people here have probably done it at least once or know someone that has.<br /><br />Sorry for preaching but it&#039;s also apart of the learning process to decide if you want to do it.

				Sounds like a bad idea IMO, there&#039;s a ton of drugs you can try that don&#039;t fuck your brain up as bad. But what the fuck do I know eh? You&#039;re 15 years old and indestructible, immortal, the world is full of idiots and you&#039;ll do whatever the hell you like &#039;cause you&#039;re always right. <br /><br />I remember what it was like before I realised we humans are actually quite delicate, fallible things, and what it felt like to learn that truth.

				I agree with you JohnM but not looking to do it just looking to know what to expect before we do it. Being the high last that long we are going to wait until next weekend when she will have the house alone for 3 days. I have gotten high on crack in pot, and i didnt get hooked. I know meth is stronger but again, we dont even know how to get more. I know i cant say, i want get hooked, like anyone cant say i will. Is it a lot stronger than crack? the pot we did was a wild trip. <br /><br />Crack didn&#039;t hook me and i was told it would, so will METH hook me doing is once? We only plan to do 1/2 hits off it.

				I can tell you this much, I tried coke and crack several times in just out of high school, I went looking for it every once in a while but never did it more than one night in a weekend.&nbsp; One weekend I was looking for more and couldn&#039;t find any, the stuff was just hard to come&nbsp; by and was usually cut to hell anyway.&nbsp; A friend of mine told me not to&nbsp; bother with it, he said meth could get me higher, longer and it was cheaper.&nbsp; Everything he said was true.&nbsp; The problem was I liked it so much I kept seeking it more, a whole week had gone by without me realizing it.&nbsp; I continued to use it for 5 years and took a lot of effort to stop using it regularly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve dabbled in it from time to time after that but it was probably the hardest thing for me to quit doing regularly.<br /><br />If you are dead set on doing it, search the forums for proper methods of smoking it with a glass pipe.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend snorting it as it&#039;s easy to do more than you meant to that way.&nbsp; As always my original opinion stands; think about whether it&#039;s really worth it.&nbsp; I know we&#039;re here on SR and it&#039;s a drug forum/market but it&#039;s always nice to get information before making a decision.

				thanks JohnM, at least you give reasons why not to try it. Who knows, maybe we sell it off lol <br />We decided to at least wait until next week when we are alone. But she has pot,we are about to get high on that. I am sure no one will be upset at that. Life is so much better high ;)

				Do yourself a favor.. sell it, then buy some weed and alcohol. Maybe some LSD if you feel like tripping out for the day.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure everyone else has said this, but I can promise you 10-20 years from now you won&#039;t look back on this and think &quot;shit, I wish I&#039;d have smoked that meth when I had the chance.&quot;<br /><br />Best of luck to you either way.

				very possible scenario that you will tweak out get paranoid and end up freaking out to your parents who will then take you to the hospital. Probably one of the worst chemicals you can put into your body at your age for numerous reasons you do not want to hear. Playing with fire and you will get burned. So many other much more enjoyable drugs to be doing at your age if you must insist on doing them.

You&#039;d be better off taking mdma or something nice. Its more fun, better for your health, and less addictive. <br /><br />Its aaaall fun and games until somebody loses a tooth...

				@railgun.- exactly my thoughts. why would you say im 15 if you dont want people to say youre too young for this shit etc... <br /><br /><br />Paramoregirl -theres better ways to get attention than smoking meth to be honest. why dont you go do some good coke,molly LSD shrooms etc instead from jumping from weed to crystal meth. it really doesnt make you hardcore.

What he said. When a bunch of druggies are telling you it&#039;s a bad fucking idea you can be sure it is. Friend told me he was thinking of trying meth once and I slapped his shit right there.<br /><br />You&#039;re an edgy teen who&#039;s all angsty and rebellious. Why else would you choose the second worst thing I&#039;ve heard of next to krokodil? When people tell you you&#039;re a stupid kid they aren&#039;t just saying it. It&#039;s because you&#039;re acting like one. Buy LSD or some safe shit. You don&#039;t need to kill yourself to get high and have a good time. The fact you don&#039;t know that shows me that you&#039;re doing it to be self destructive. Enjoy your teen pregnancy drug babby from getting knocked up looking for meth money and looking like a 60 year old hooker in 3 years. But what do people who spend their lives around drugs know about them, right?

				Just research it on the clearnet. It&#039;s a lot quicker than asking people, all the questions you asked have been covered heaps of times. If you&#039;re so un educated about such a dangerous drug I really think you should double think it. If you were expecting everyone here to tell you to go for it, you&#039;re stupid. Yes this forum is pretty much all about drugs, a majority of drug users have common sense.

				Im sorry paramoregirl, but 15 is simply too young<br /><br />Im not one to preach, but i started doing drugs very young, i had my first hit off a bong at 11, and my first percocet at 12..its been all down hill from there. Dont get me wrong, im alive, healthy and kind of fortunate, i have a roof, a bed and i dont go hungry, but the past 20 years has been a constant struggle, all due to my love of getting high.<br /><br />&nbsp;None of this is to say you wont get your meth, do it, and move on..maybe youll become a meth junky. Every one is an individual and no two are alike. I just have to tell you, that if by 15 your looking to do meth, i can absolutely PROMISE you, that you will be an addict for as long as you live. I dont mean a meth addict, or maybe not even an addict of any thing really crazy, but rest assure, you will always be looking to get fucked up, some how or another. Be it weed, cigs, alcohol, an occasional rx pill here and there..always something.<br /><br />&nbsp;I suppose what it all boils down to, is over the years, all the different shit youve done, hard drugs like meth or otherwise, will over time have depleted and altered so much of your brain chemistry, that with out some sort of mind stimulating/altering substance in you, you will never achieve true happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;Just my two cents, i wish you the best of luck and safety. Much love.

				And it is such threads that feed the SR trolls/drug warriors.<br />While I am painfully aware that you cannot talk teenies out of their adventures this thread will feed such trolls only as it gives them something where they can point out that SR assists/encourages kids to take drugs.<br />It is a problem because I still feel that the information request about dangerous drugs (yes, Meth is one) is paramount to any moral stance.<br />Honestly I wish these two birds cannot make it work as it will rob them of the capability to enjoy lesser dopamine-creating joys of life.

				Personally, I think 15 is way too young for meth, infact probably most drugs.. I&#039;m in my mid twenties, I&#039;ve tried my fair share of drugs and have been recreational using all sorts for years, and even I wouldn&#039;t try meth, although that&#039;s mainly because it just doesn&#039;t appeal to me at all.. I had a best friend that got in a terrible state from being addicted to it, she lost massive amount of weight, got kicked out her house, nearly ended up on the streets and she seen countless friends fall into harder stuff ruining their lives.<br /><br />That said, if you choose to do it, be responsible and stay safe!

				I really hope she decides to throw that shit away. Even though I had already done a few different drugs by the time I was 15, I do not condone it.<br /><br />I feel like there are so much more, safer, fun things to do. I would rather trip balls on lsd for the day. LSD makes me the happiest I&#039;ve ever been and I never feel like I need to do it. I&#039;m never itchin for some acid hahaha.

				I think its a broken record by now, but I suspect that if you even came to the SR forums to look for the answer you&#039;ve probably been given the same advice every other avenue you took. At 15, if you&#039;re able to find the location to get here, you&#039;ve started somewhere that had the info to begin with.<br /><br />The reality is very simple. There is a reason that down every alley and every search, you find something about how bad meth is. You came here looking for advice, and you&#039;re getting wisdom. Take it from us, if you were around most of us and we were planning on tweaking, you wouldn&#039;t even be in the room much less have access to take any amount of it. Whoever had their stash out that you could find it needs a good informative bonk on the noggin.<br /><br />You have plenty of time to make mistakes, graduate first, at least then your graduation pictures have teeth.
