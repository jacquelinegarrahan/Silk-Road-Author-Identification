				YOU FUCKED UP!&nbsp; When you tried this one http://silkroadvb6piz3r.onion/ you gave your password to a scamming asshole and he logged in the correct one at silkroadvb5piz3r.onion and changed your password and stole all of your coins.&nbsp; Sorry :(

				Thanks alot for your help, much appreciated :)<br /><br />I only had a tiny sum of BTC in the account luckily, but i do have some open orders I&#039;d like to check up on.<br />Just for clarity, I did not enter any PIN at the logon site. You need the pin to transfer BTC no? :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll make another account and do as you have said. Thanks again!

				Sorry to hear that man, I ended up on that site too out of the hidden wiki, except it was when I was trying to register, and I couldn&#039;t figure out what the heck the thing wouldn&#039;t let me register. Then I saw a writeup about the fake sites asking for the pin at login.
