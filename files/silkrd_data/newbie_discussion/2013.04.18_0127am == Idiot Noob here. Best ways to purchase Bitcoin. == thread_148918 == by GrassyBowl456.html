				Ok, so it seems to me that one of the most confusing aspects of SR isn&#039;t so much SR itself. It&#039;s what the best fucking way to buy Bitcoin is. <br /><br />Every time I&#039;m reading someones suggestions, it seems that its outdated, or someone is saying something negative about the method.<br /><br />So I ask, what are some of the current best/safest ways to buy bitcoin, and then get it into my SR account. I&#039;m in the US. It just seems like a big fucking headache.

				I was in your shoes not long ago.<br />So, I&#039;ll be happy to help...First, create a secure wallet...then, you have to decide how you want to obtain bitcoins (find the bitcoin wiki page, it will give you EVERYTHING you need to know, including a super helpful video)<br /><br />Check that out and you should be on the right track!<br /><br />Once you get the bitcoins figured out, just wait until you have to figure out pgp&#039;s...I&#039;m stuck on that right now

				In all honesty, Bitinstant is the go to source for easy, fast, and dam near effortless bitcoin funding. Go to Bitinstant&#039;s website and chose the cash deposit to bitcoin address option. Go to your local Walmart chain and fill out a moneygram slip the way Bitinstant tells you to in your order info. Use a bogus name on the money gram slip to be anonymous as possible because Walmart doesn&#039;t require you to have an ID to do this. I bought some coins a few weeks back and they were basically in my account by the time I got home. Hope this helps !!

				NARK0T1X<br />Have you figured out the pgp encryption yet?<br />I see that you are pretty new on here too and I cannot figure out how to de-code these encrypted messages to be able to make a purchase. Could you please share your knowledge with me if and when you figure it out?....<br /><br />Also, are you on right now? I haven&#039;t been able to log in for hours...

				If you need a wallet apart from SR, I love blockchain.info/wallet, even though they go down every so often like right now. But they have convenient integration with BitInstant for really the easiest anonymous cash to BTC system there is at the moment. But it is expensive, BitInstant takes 3.99%, and ZipZap takes a $3.95 fee. (ZipZap is the go between BitInstant uses with MoneyGram who actually *does not* take a fee, presumably due to an arrangement with ZipZap. When you think about it the chain is fairly long: MoneyGram &gt; ZipZap &gt; BitInstant &gt; Mt Gox &gt; to your wallet of choice.) <br /><br />If you don&#039;t have a need for an external wallet you can use SR as a wallet and direct BitInstant to deposit there. Just, you know, caveat emptor: SR could go poof whenever along with your BTC so, be risk aware.

				Ok I beg you listen to me. Bitinstant has some 25% of all tranactions fucked up, disappear or, take a week or more. The best, safest, and most anonymous way to do it is through a Moneypak to bitcoin service on the road. Some of the vendors on the road will sell you BTC for Moneypaks, which are cash and impossible to connect to you, and even from some vendors on here it is cheaper then any other exchange.<br /><br />Chaos

				Hi, what&#039;s the difference between websites based wallet like blockchain and software based wallet like the bitcoin client? I have installed bitcoin-qt but it&#039;s very slow to connect to the network and I dont have any bitcoin yet. I&#039;m planning to buy a paysafecard (passing trought linden) or Ukash (no linden needed?) and using it to buy bitcoins on virwox and similar, the fees are high but it seems the most secure solution here

				hi all,<br /><br />obvs i&#039;m bit of a newb with this online stuff...<br /><br />i&#039;m finding that acquiring my first bitcoins is a bit of a catch-22 with respect to anonymity... seems to be the &quot;easy&quot; way going to cvs/walmart and then bitinstant via moneygram/zipzap will hit you with a 4% fee -- and then on top of that you got a limit of like 500$ but i suppose for small amounts this would suffice..<br /><br />the &quot;more anonymous&quot; way would seem to buy from a reputable vendor on SR...... however being a new user and having no bitcoins it&#039;s kinda difficult to transact on a bitcoin only marketplace :)<br /><br />SO, this brings me to the million dollar question: wtf do we do? am i limited to these 2 basic options? seems like the methods CONSTANTLY change or get fubar...<br /><br />beyond all that, how necessary is it to launder your coins before and after transacting on SR? i know the blockchain is all public info -- but how far back can a transaction be traced? can you go all the way back to when that particular coin was mined?&nbsp; or would it be sufficient to set up a few dummy wallets and cycle coins between each one in various amounts then to final destination? or is that silly and can be detected? <br /><br />lastly, you all using online wallets or keeping that shit on a usb stick? my intuition would tell me physical usb stick wallet is safer... so is blockchain wallet only for temporary coins? so bloody confusing...<br /><br />any help is greatly appreciated!!<br />-random

				I&#039;ve been looking on the forum for ages now for a definitive answer to a question quite a few others have also asked:<br /><br />What&#039;s the best way for people in the UK to buy bitcoins? <br /><br />So far, the only options I&#039;ve found are: localbitcoins.com (where the sellers are asking way over the average market price) or buying from an SR vendor (dodgy at best). <br /><br />Why aren&#039;t there any reputable places where BTC can be bought with a debit card? I&#039;m less concerned about anonymity than about getting ripped-off, as there are ways to anonymise coins once purchased.
