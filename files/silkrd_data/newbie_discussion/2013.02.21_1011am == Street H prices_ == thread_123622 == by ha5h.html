				Title: <strong>Street H prices?</strong><br />

				Long time lurker, first time poster.<br /><br />Does anyone here also use a street hookup for H? I&#039;m curious about what the current price for say, a bundle or a gram, would go for IRL.<br /><br />I used to use east-coast H on a daily basis in my late teens and was clean for over 10 years until recently. I ordered a bundle from DD for around $180, very good quality #4 dope and great service (supposedly the cheapest US domestic on SR as well). I tried Prejator, which really wasn&#039;t that good. Street dope I used to get was in a rock form, very rarely would it be in envelopes, and if it was it wasn&#039;t as good. I used to be able to get a gram of dope for $80 - $90 and a gram of coke for $30 - $50 (this is the late nineties-early 00&#039;s). I expect everything to be more expensive but I&#039;m curious as to exactly how crazy the markup is on SR in relation to current street prices. It seems to be at least double or triple what I&#039;m used to.

				I&#039;m surprised no one knows this. I have learned not to trust police reports about drug prices, because they always use the highest extreme possible (to help with a conviction I suppose.)

				I find you do pay a bit of a premium for the convenience of Sr but because I am now as close to a straight john as i can get I just can&#039;t hit my smaller town looking for down off of guys i thought may know where i can find some. And even if I do find some the quality will most likely be crap if you don&#039;t have a good relationship with a high up dealer. the coke i have purchased on sr has been dynamite compared to the local shit. The H i got off of Sr was good for fixing but sucked for smoking and that was off tomorrwoman who was an awesome vendor.
