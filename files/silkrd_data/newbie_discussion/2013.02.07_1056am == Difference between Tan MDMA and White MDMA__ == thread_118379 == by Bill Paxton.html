				New to SR but have made a few orders already.&nbsp; Been getting my MDMA from Off The Wagon and its INCREDIBLE!!!&nbsp; (he&#039;s an excellent seller who&#039;s very patient, has SUPER discreet/professional shipping, has an AMAZING product)<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering what the difference is between Tan MDMA and White MDMA ??<br /><br />Also, is it possible to cook up a batch of MDMA that is higher than 84% or is that as good as it gets??<br /><br />Thannk,<br /><br />-Bill Paxton

				How much it has been cleaned afterwards and how it was made affects the colour.

				Could you be a little more specific? I don&#039;t need a text book on the subject.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m just trying to learn more.<br /><br />the 84% I&#039;ve been getting from Off The Wagon is simply off the chain!!<br /><br />When you say clean are you talking about&nbsp; when they &quot;wash&quot; it? In Theory couldn&#039;t you wash it a bunch of times or is there a limit?<br /><br />-Bill

				Anecdotally, if you&#039;re planning on snorting, white crystals is the only way to go.

				I&#039;ve had good luck with tan shards before, just ordered some more. I wondered if it was a different synthesis process that resulted in the different color.

				As mentioned before, the color is due to impurity (which means it&#039;s probably not 84% MDMA, but it&#039;s ok, they all lie). The brown/tan color most likely comes from MDP-2-P, a precursor to MDMA, which was left over from a synthesis that&#039;s was not 100% professional. The THEORETICAL maximum MDMA content of MDMA-HCl is 87%, but 84% is a more reliable number. Pure MDMA-HCl should be white, but this doesn&#039;t always mean that white MDMA = pure, since the impurities might be white as well.

				Thanks for the responses.&nbsp; <br /><br />The recent batch is incredible, I mean this shit is really good. (Again, from Off The Wagon) .... This batch has a purple hue to it.&nbsp; Any idea&#039;s as to what thats about? <br /><br />Its been washed same as usual,&nbsp; 2x ? <br /><br />I&#039;m not concerned at all with the purple hue as the quality of product speaks for itself. Just curious.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s always just a matter of leftovers from the chemical process to make it. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much. Like you said, quality speaks for itself. I&#039;ve had it in every color from pure to to off white, tan, and grey.
