				I think it&#039;s something with security so I&#039;m almost certain the answer is yes. Any seasoned comrades that can give me a clue??

				It&#039;s an operating system on a flash drive so that nothing is ever saved on your hard drive.&nbsp; Even though you may erase something from a hard drive, it&#039;s digital signiture is ALWAYS there and programmers have the equipment necessary to access this -FEDS, LE. Only way to destroy a hard drive is take it out of your computer, beat the shit out of it with a hammer or burn it.&nbsp; So- yes if you are here visiting this forum, then you probably should use it. ESPECIALLY if you&#039;re a vendor.&nbsp; Im just learning about it myself.&nbsp;

				It also pre-configures a lot of applications to use Tor out the box, including web browser (TorBrowser), instant messaging, email, etc. Plus it implements some enhanced anonymity features like stream isolation. It&#039;s an excellent out of the box solution for beginners.<br /><br />The web site is here:&nbsp; https://tails.boum.org<br /><br />And a good guide on setting it up is here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.0

				Hi folks,<br /><br />You should definitely be using TAILS, and can find an excellent setup guide here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=114141.0<br /><br />It only takes a few minutes to set up and the security benefits of running TAILS over the regular Tor Browser through Windows are unquantifiable!<br /><br />Libertas<br /><br />EDIT: Dammit, astor! ;D

				Speaking of security. Does anyone have any experience or feedback on uglysurfer? He sells various flash drives with different levels of security.<br />Tor and the Onion network are new to me and I&#039;m interested in additional security. I need to research &quot;Tails&quot;. I&#039;m not familiar with it and if it&#039;s fairly simple for beginners, that&#039;s what I&#039;m looking for.

				I am a newbie. Comfortable figuring out tech but certainly no expert. I got TAILS up and running on a flash drive without too much trouble and I like it a lot. I even managed to upgrade it without much trouble when the new version came out recently. I recommend giving it a go.<br />-saidanddone

				pencapchew:<br /><br />Yes. The drive has to be 2GB at least I think. There is a nice feature once you have it installed where you can create a password-protected &quot;persistence&quot; partition and you can save some items there, everything else is wiped from memory when you close up. Good for storing pgp keys etc. When I upgraded TAILS there was an option to keep the persistence folder intact.<br /><br />Good luck. <br />-saidanddone
