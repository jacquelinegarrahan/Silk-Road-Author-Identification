				So I&#039;m new to Silk Road. Totally thrilled by it. I have access to tons of replica clothing through suppliers and I really wanna make a go at selling replicas on Silk Road. I&#039;m just curious about how well they sell and if its worth my bond to make a go at it. <br /><br />Before anyone established gets upset I want you guys to know my replicas are of brands that I don&#039;t really see on Silk Road already so I probably won&#039;t steal your business!<br /><br />I&#039;d be super appreciative of some honest info/advice!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Thanks!

				It seems unlikely to be profitable when you factor in the initial vendor fee and comissions.

				Good question, I&#039;d wondered about that myself. It&#039;s a pretty big category but I think I&#039;d be put off buying anything that needed to be in the correct size. I don&#039;t know that SR&#039;s returns policy is too hot &amp; sending stuff back to China might get tricky :) I had a very quick browse the other day, and a lot of designer knock off stuff seemed pretty pricey - not being able to check out the quality beforehand, that would put me off paying a lot. So there&#039;s a tonne of listings, but I&#039;d be surprised if there&#039;s that much turnover - go through the big vendors feedbacks I guess, that might gauge it a bit.

				I imagine that foreign knockoff sites already have the grasp on replica clothing. Then again, I&#039;m no expert on selling apparel on the Road<br /><br />However, I may be interested depending on what you&#039;ve got.

				Thanks for the responses so far!&nbsp; ;D And I would definitely not be worried about my profit margin and not knock anyone out there, but the replicas I would offer would be significantly less expensive then some of the stuff I&#039;ve been seeing. <br /><br />Consider that we get our bonds back if we prove ourselves, I&#039;m not really worried about that, but I don&#039;t really want to get into all of the hassle if I have only a few sales a month. I go for it even if I&#039;d only have a sale a day (30 per month). <br /><br />I guess my ultimate question is is whether anyone knows hard numbers about sale volumes on SR.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; ;D
