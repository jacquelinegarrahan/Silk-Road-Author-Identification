				They are priced way lower than the ones on the street in my area, and I was thinking of ordering. Does anyone else have experience with them?

				I have several times she used to be my go-to for shrooms until she left for a bit. I now use MushroomMafia and will never go to anyone else. They are restocking at the moment but have the best shrooms I have ever had and MushroomGirls weren&#039;t actually that good and normally not dried fully and I like to have chalk dry. Some batches were lots of small ones where as MushroomMafia I&#039;ve had nice full caps and stems. They also have several types of shrooms at times and the penis envy is a must whenever its in stock.

				Yes and her shrooms are very strong. She shipped them out quickly to me, I had them in 2 or 3 days. I received 0.7gr overweight on the 1/4oz. I ordered.=) <br /><br />I tried them out Friday before last. I ate 1.4gr and was surprised to trip with the intensity that I did. Had a wonderful time that night. <br /><br />This Friday that just passed I upped the dose to about 2.4 and WHEWWW!!! it was intense. I again had a great time but this time I had slight visuals, a feeling of time slowing to a near crawl while my mind increased in speed and activity, it felt like a mild DMT trip except I found myself to be aware of the load on my body the shrooms had far more than when I smoke DMT or changa.<br /><br />I will definitely be placing another order some time soon.
