				Nice thread... <br />I love love love when a new album is released and I can review it in fine detail to determine the meaning behind each and every song. For the moment I&#039;m really into this one:<br /><br />Should Be Higher<br />I dream of a day when I dare to believe you&#039;re the answer<br />When the shame and the guilt are removed and the truth appears<br />Oh the touch of your hand, I lose who I am<br />If I want to<br />I try to resist but succumb to the bliss of your kiss<br /><br />You should be Higher<br />I&#039;ll take you higher<br />Don&#039;t be afraid <br />You&#039;ll just have to pray<br /><br />Your lies are more attractive than the truth<br />Love is all I want<br />Your lies are written down in your book <br />Love is all I want<br /><br />Your arms are infected<br />They&#039;re holding the truth<br />Oh stop all your crying<br />This one you&#039;ll lose <br /><br />DM Delta Machine 2013<br /><br />This one has several meanings to me. It&#039;s hard to believe it would have one finite meaning.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d love to hear your opinions on this one...<br /><br />45mypet: you didn&#039;t give us any lyrics... :)

				Meek Mill is the artist? I&#039;d like to look them up. I can tell just by the lyrics they are a completely different genre then mine. The way I read those lyrics it just sounds like pain... constant pain, no? <br /><br />Should be Higher: Dave has this amazing voice that he can manipulate like no other I&#039;ve ever heard before. He makes you feel the desperation and pain with his voice. Damn! I just love this song! They are my favorite band so I&#039;m incredibly passionate about their music. <br /><br />Anyone else?
