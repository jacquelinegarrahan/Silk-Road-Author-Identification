				These are my stats.. nearly a month. Amazing experiences. Nothing left in the mail, I&#039;m all good.<br /><br />Total transactions: 17<br />Total spent: $2421.55<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 27 days<br /><br />Bitcoin was my first challenge. I always buy the coins through my exchange, through tor, with cash in person at the bank (no names/signatures) then on to a tormail.org verified account on CAVirtex.com.. buy the coins as fast as possible so I don&#039;t loose anything with sudden drops... Then I always use bitcoinfog as I feel its an added layer of security for 20 bucks. I can vouch that although the service is sort of slow and a bit pricey, http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ works and is not a scam. I put all my coins through here before the road. (I know SR does coin mixing, but its a nice buffer in my opinion)<br /><br /><br />Amazing experiences so far. I&#039;ve never even had coke I enjoyed before trying a couple vendors here.<br /><br />I also got some God Weed which is something I smoked a couple of years ago visiting BC.. such a unique bud.. so light smoking but such a heady high, amazing taste. Never thought I&#039;d see it again. Now I have a shit load of it.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had 1 single hiccup yet (other than H nausea) with a lot of money and transactions (as far as I can see Im buying lots compared to other people in general when just getting started)<br /><br />Again, all domestic, I couldn&#039;t imagine dealing with the paranoia of waiting on Customs. (I have had a fucking vinyl record take 3 weeks over expected shipping date because they opened the box to see what was there... it was a goddamn Bach album!! 3 weeks! ugg)<br /><br />Here&#039;s hoping these types of reports bring lurking newbies to actually try this out.<br /><br />My advice is READ READ READ .. there are so many valuable resources on these forums for security and also for vendor info. <br /><br />Also, it is my opinion that if some vendor offers &quot;HIGH STEALTH&quot; options or is known to be an amazing packager, always go with this vendor as stealth is MOST important for you as the buyer. All the risk is with you. I feel like packaging should be able to be opened and fiddled around with by a COP without finding the gear. I have seen this stealth and I will never order from a couple of vendors that &quot;hid&quot; my rock of H in a few papers.. not cool and leaving me literately high and dry if my mail lady were to get interested. Packaging should be fucking bulletproof, and scentless. Try mrouid.. and you if you are vendor you should order something from him and start doing what hes doing, its incredible and very safe in my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks SR!<br /><br />Much love<br /><br />namelessmess ;)<br /><br /><br />

I&#039;d be interested to know if there&#039;s a few more gem vendors I haven&#039;t tried yet.

				Wow, you&#039;re really powering ahead there.<br /><br />I thought that&#039;s what my stats would look like before too long, but luckily the substances I enjoy taking are phens and tryptamines and the like, so I&#039;ve only spent about 1k in about a year, as they&#039;re a LOT cheaper (and better quality) than I can get locally. H and C are different stories though.<br /><br />You must be annoyed by the newbie posting limit thing, you could have added a lot of value to review threads with stats like that.<br />I only recently discovered, as I&#039;ve not posted for a while, and was thoroughly pissed off when I couldn&#039;t show my appreciation for some vendors in their review threads.<br /><br />And yeah, I&#039;ve been surprised when I&#039;ve had psychedelics from a different continent arrive in half the time it takes for an LP to arrive from a few hours drive away...

I usually sign Mike Hawk really messy. Never go to the ones near my drop point ..dunno if thats just dumb paranoia as per usual with me.<br /><br />I usually go CAD to CAVirtex account (only ever logged into with tor and registered on tormail address)<br />then I send to blockchain.info wallet that also is clean never logged in other than tor.. no email necessary you will only ever use this wall once (this also may be an unnecessary step but fun i guess as you can dice a few just for shits.. more dumbness on my part)<br />then I send to fog then to SR..<br /><br />

				sorry not to try to make anyone jealous...<br />trying to inspire! lol<br /><br />but ya sorry about any financial troubles or anything like that...ive definitely had my share of cold nights &quot;camping&quot; with a couple of needles in my arm... but... i am a freakish saver and budget masta at my core.., and I was hyper motivated to get a decent job with a way up when I was young and not high as fuck.. now I can sorta do what I want as long as I am super careful.. being 40ish has its benefits over my early empty wallets days<br /><br />but like I said I blew my yearly drug budget in a month so really continuing this way would fucking put some children out of a future of free university in about a year..<br /><br />as far as MDMA i got some from tomorrowman honestly ive had better but it came really fast.<br />i think anything like a gram of a power or pill is pretty impossible to be caught especially domestically.<br />(unless the stealth is a crumbled paper envelope taped shut by the post office)<br /><br />good day!<br />namelessmess<br />

				hello nameslessmess, you mention something about you never near your drop points, but if you think logically, you stand out too much like this to law enforcement, so i would suggest you use the whole town systematically, i dont know but anyone else agree with me?

				Sorry, but what do you mean by drop points? How can you send something to an address that is not your own?<br /><br />I placed my first order today, nothing major, just some Tramadol since it was cheaper here than paying for a doctor visit (about $300) and then paying for the Tramadol at the pharmacy (about $50 or so).<br /><br />I am assuming by &quot;drop point&quot; you mean having the orders sent somewhere other than your own address? <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				Yeah, what&#039;s up with the drop point?&nbsp; I just use my families po box and I don&#039;t worry about too much security with the bitcoin since SR mixes them and I buy them anonymously.&nbsp; Plus I never buy large quantities, the largest thing I bought was a half ounce of diesel and the package was still relatively small.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think people need to be too crazy as long as the vendor has good reviews for packaging.
