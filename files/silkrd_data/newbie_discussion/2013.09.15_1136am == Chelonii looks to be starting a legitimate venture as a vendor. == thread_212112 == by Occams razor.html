				Greetings everyone. As I was browsing the Newbie discussion forums I came upon this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209580.0<br /><br />Chelonii, and any new vendor undergoing unfounded scrutiny, deserves an objective assessment based on facts. So I will do my best to provide this.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />After reading MrJoshua&#039;s entire thread, then reading Chelonii&#039;s profile, his discussion page, and his product listing, I feel I can objectively say that he appears to be starting a legitimate venture.<br /><br />I will go over the finer points of my observations:<br /><br />Pricing:<br />Offers 10g of Allylescaline at 28% cheaper per gram than 1000mg of Allylescaline. 5g at 6% cheaper than 1000mg.<br />Offers 1000mg of 25N-NBOMe at 10% cheaper per gram than 500mg of 25N-NBOMe.<br />Similar pay scales found with other products.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Assessment: Common business practice to scale price down for bulk orders as this moves product more quickly. Reasonable.&gt;<br />For orders outside of the United States, only bulk quantities are offered.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Assessment: Selling smaller quantities internationally may not be economically viable based on shipping costs, à¸¿ to $ conversions, and overhead. This may also be part of a risk assessment analysis where moving multiple small amounts through customs increases risk to his business. Less quantity of bulk orders is more viable than more quantity of small orders when it comes to risk and paying off overhead. Reasonable.&gt;<br /><br />Product listings:<br />The description fields seem to be hit and miss with descriptive details and information about the product.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Assessment: A lack of details and information may dissuade prospective customers and lacks a professional display. Needs improvement.&gt;<br /><br />Reviews on profile:<br />Seven reviews so far out of 10 transactions, a few of which the buyers have 10+/10+/10+ stats. All reviews give 5/5. Review submission times range from 2 days to 1 month old with an average time of 15 days.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Assessment: All customers giving feedback are pleased with the product and service provided by the vendor. This is good.&gt;<br /><br />Profile page:<br />Writes clear and concise sections on policy, shipping, and buying.<br />Includes PGP public key<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Assessment: While some information has a scornful tone, overall it is informative and descriptive . Acceptable.&gt; <br />&quot;Please do not talk about consumption with me whatsoever. Your account will immediately be blacklisted if you do so.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Assessment: This implies that the chemical products being sold are intended for chemical research only or non-consumption implementation. This is usually stated to affirm the legality of their distribution, thus protecting the distributor from legal repercussion due to their effects on plants, animals, and humans. A good example of this are N20 Cream Chargers (whip-its). Reasonable.&gt;<br />&quot;Long time vendor finally bringing my wares to the SR community&quot; <br />&quot;All packages will have tracking, I will not provide tracking unless requested&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;Assessment: These statements contradict other information or are poorly worded. Regarding the first statement, Chelonii has only been a vendor for a month, which does not constitute a &#039;long time&#039; in relation to other SR vendors. Perhaps &#039;long time buyer&#039; was the intended statement? Regarding the second statement, stating that &#039;all packages will have tracking available&#039; would be better suited when preceding the remaining statement. Or omitting the first half entirely would be sufficient. As it stands, the first half contradicts the second. Improvement is needed.&gt;<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Based on this information it appears that Chelonii is earnestly conducting a legitimate business and has room for improvements. This is only based on current information. As transactions between him and buyers are completed over time with subsequent reviews, only then will we know the consistency of his business conduct.<br /><br /><br />I myself plan on purchasing a small amount of Allylescaline in the future to asses his product, review how he conducts business, and to promote a new vendor.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.&nbsp; :)<br />
