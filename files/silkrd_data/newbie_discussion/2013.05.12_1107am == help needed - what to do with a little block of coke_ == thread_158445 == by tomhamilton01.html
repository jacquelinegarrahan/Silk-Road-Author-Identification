				Serious noob here on the forum - this is my first post ever. Just received an order from dmtdoodeelsd for 1g coke - yet to try so product review is not possible atm but I was expecting the coke to arrive in powder form but instead have got a little block of coke. I&#039;ve emailed him a few times but he doesn&#039;t really seem to understand what I&#039;m saying which seems a bit odd seeing as it&#039;s his own product.<br /><br />Has anyone else received their coke from him in this form or is it always in powder form?<br />And do I need to use a razor to shave the coke from the block or can I just crumble it up in my hand?<br /><br />Sorry for the serious noob question. Much appreciated for any help.<br /><br />

				Just crush it - so many ways you can do it.<br /><br />For example, wrap in paper and smash with sledge hammer&nbsp; ;)

				I always prefer my drugs to come in a lump for most of the time its a sign that it hasnt been fkd with.you know its come straight off the block and not mixed with anything.although I do know that you can mix it up and re-press it back to a lump but in general,I like lumps!!<br />In answer to your question-wash it all back and smoke it&nbsp; ;D

				That&#039;s generally a good sign as others have said. You just need to smash it up so you can consume it. Crush it with something heavy and then chop it up with a razor or even a card. But remember, Cocaine is a hell of a drug, sir.

				Ha ha, ya you must be pretty newb.&nbsp; That&#039;s cool though, we&#039;ve all been there.&nbsp; <br /><br />When coke is shipped from it&#039;s country of manufacture like Peru or Columbia it is wrapped into Kilogram sized bricks.&nbsp; This is when the coke is most pure that is why when someone says &quot;it&#039;s straight off the brick&quot; it is suppose to mean it is uncut.<br /><br />As the kilogram gets broken down and sold in smaller portions to other dealers, those dealers may choose to cut the pure coke in order to increase their profits.<br /><br />Now, as far as being in a clump or powder, it doesn&#039;t really matter because a lot of dealers &quot;re-rock&quot; the coke after they cut it so it looks like it&#039;s straight off the brick.&nbsp; If you get powder from the bottom of the kilo it could still be good.&nbsp; Some of the worst coke I&#039;ve had was in a brick form and I&#039;ve also had good coke that was mostly powder.<br /><br />A better judge of quality is just by looking at it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Slightly yellowish, somewhat oily, flakey or a shiney sheen, in my experience, is usually better.&nbsp; Dry and gritty like chalk and pure white is usually more cut.&nbsp; A strong odor is usually a good sign too.&nbsp; Also, if the rock breaks down into powder very easily it has probably been re-rocked.&nbsp; If the chunk just keep breaking into smaller chunks then it might be better.<br /><br />Either way, just break it down into a fine powder and sniff that shit.

				Thanks for all the replies - that answers my questions! Ha, yeah I must sound like such a noob.<br /><br />Whose coke do you recommend? I&#039;ve got orders from Lloydsbrothers and dmtdoodeelsd but yet to try either. So far I&#039;ve based my purchases on the forums / feedback.

Yeah, forum feedback and blind testing threads are here if you look hard enough, thats a good place to start.

				I have to ask, OP.&nbsp; Are you serious, or are you just having fun with us? ;)<br /><br />As everyone has said, crush it up somehow. What you do with it after that is up to you. If it were ME...I&#039;d either sell it to someone else or flush it. Coke is great the first time you do it. After that, it&#039;s just chasing the dragon, man. If there is any substance that can actual contain evil...cocaine is it. I gave it up along time ago, but it was hard to do.&nbsp; If you DO try it....make sure you have a slutty girl with you. They LOVE that shit and they will show their appreciation in ways you never thought possible.<br /><br />Good luck to you, man.

				Even for fishscale, the blow is expensive on the road.&nbsp; The most I paid locally for a ball of fishscale was $200 and I have gotten them as low as $125.&nbsp; Many of the prices here blow me away, no pun intended.&nbsp; I guess if you can&#039;t find it in your area, you&#039;ll pay what ever.

No desire to get too hooked on it - just want a bit of a blow out to celebrate. <br /><br />Which vendors do you recommend for coke on SR? I&#039;ve bought from Lloydsbrothers and dmtdoodeelsd but not tried yet. Anyone with any experience from these vendors?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so you bought it and don&#039;t know what to do with it to the point that you still have the stuff you bought sitting in a drawer????<br /><br />this has got to be a joke thread!!<br /><br />And by the way clumps don&#039;t necessarily mean good, what the hell, 1kg in brick form doesn&#039;t necessarily mean good quality, they get cut and rebricked all the time which makes it a pain in the arse for people like me. gotta go through so many test procedures before I buy anything it&#039;s not even funny.<br /><br />people do realise this, a brick looking batch doesn&#039;t mean shit anymore. needs to be tested properly with all sorts, reagent test, A/B extraction, acetone wash and so on. until that is done there&#039;s no way to know what&#039;s in your hands just from the brick look.<br /><br />I find A/B extraction is the only one that would tell me a rough amount of purity but then again it doesn&#039;t tell me what the brick has been cut with in terms of active cuts, only the nose and experience would &quot;roughly&quot; tell me that.<br /><br />anyway, man, use that stuff you received and then you&#039;ll know what cocaine is! I can say that as you have one of my orders with you ;)<br /><br />LB<br /><br />

				whenever i&#039;m crushing anything i like to use a spoon. cut it into small pieces so it doesnt fly everywhere and then use the curved side of the spoon to roll around on top of whatever your crushing. it works like a mortar and pestel and you will be left with a fine powder.

				Send it to me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll send you back a nice little bag of white powder.&nbsp; ;D Seriously, what IamMulva said. and LloydsBrothers is right.&nbsp; Rocks don&#039;t mean it&#039;s good. Numbing quality doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s good.&nbsp; Should be shiny and scaly, give a smooth high, and not shred your nose.

				Seems like your first time trying out cocaine. If its a slab off a brick than it would be hard, almost like a rock. Should have a shiny appearance, what people call &quot;fish scales.&quot; This coke you got your hands on is most likely going to be A LOT stronger than anything you&#039;ll find on the streets so be careful with how big you make your lines. Hope you enjoy it!...well try not to enjoy it too much though.&nbsp; ;)
