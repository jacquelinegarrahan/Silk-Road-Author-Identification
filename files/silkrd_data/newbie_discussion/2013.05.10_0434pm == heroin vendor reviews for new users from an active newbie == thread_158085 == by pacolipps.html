				this is simple and to the point<br />marlo is a great vendor, fast shipping and good dope...its cut, but its always better than most street gear and its cheaper than most on sr<br /><br />dragoncove is a great vendor, fast shipping and great dope for a fair price<br /><br />supersun is the best! super potent dope bth or powder or whatever he has....u wont regret a purchase ..he is higher priced but worth it<br /><br />purest is okay bth but i would not say its any more potent than cut up street gear<br /><br />seneca is a great vendor but I thought his dope was too weak to even get high at all<br /><br />supremesmoke does not live up to his hype, he shipped extremely slow to me (5 days for express!!) and his dope was weaker than marlo and dragoncove <br /><br />nod4less has NODs dope and its great, but order from nod and get the whole gram....nod4less shorted me (weighed 0.7 with the bag meaning it was about 0.55 or so) and would not even reply for a week to make it right then only offered free shipping<br />UPDATE!!<br />n4l has yet to make this right and its been 2 weeks now, he offered a credit and all I want is what I was shorted...he says he does not want to ship cause it is too much risk?? ISNT THAT WHAT THEY DO HERE?? SHIP DRUGS?? how come he claims he always takes care of his customers and makes it right, yet he shorted me a good part of one of my $65 quarter grams....expensive ass dope and I only ask for a couple points to make up for the couple points I was legitimately shorted on an order of 3/4 a gram and 2 weeks later this is still not resolved......and I even gave him a 5 of 5 feedback and erased all mention of my order being short.....and he is still giving me a hard time??? AT THIS POINT I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ...I like him and he ships fast and he has the best dope....but I was shorted (actually he is the only person that has ever shorted me on silk road) I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING MORE THAN 1/4 GRAM and that is your call....I have to be honest here as I am with my reddit posts and tell it how it is....YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE YOUR FULL ORDER WITH THIS VENDOR AND APPARENTLY HE DOES NOT FIX HIS MISTAKES<br /><br />einstein777 advertises his dope is tested and he admitted never testing it after i got a bad batch ....he does have some fire dope, but not worth the risk because when he sold me some bunk shit he refused to make it right and I basically got ripped off for the first time on the road.....I got a gram that literally took me almost a quarter gram per shot to get me feeling okay and i normally only use 0.05 at a time between me and my wife per dose....he treated me like I dont matter and I was lying to him but there is no way he should be selling something that weak after advertising his dope as tested and the first time I got a half gram from him it was the best i ever had.....so its up you if you want to take the risk<br /><br />dieseltherapy ...the first gram i got from him was very weak, but now that he has some new gear, he sent me a half gram and a xanax mint to make up for it and it was decent dope (powder) ...it was equal to some really good street gear and his price is very low at only $80 a gram.....so give this guy a chance , dont be fooled by the low price...his dope is as good as most other powder on the road that cost twice to 3 times as much!!<br /><br />heavenlyblack ...good bth, but not pure as stated...not even close...it was worth getting though..fast shipping and good vendor, needed about twice my normal dose to get off<br /><br />chemicalcat still never shipped after 3 weeks<br />UPDATE!! I received his package today and he hooked it up, so I can tell you this guy is legit....he was in the hospital for a while and had some problems so he made it up by sending me double the dope and a couple vics...which I dont think he realizes he should have sent something other than vics as I use dope and dont get off on vics????but either way I am happy with the transaction now......<br /><br /><br />...I am going to post another reply here and break it down (as far as my experience with each vendors product)

				I am in the US and I have only gotten from 1 UK vendor, and they are legit...super potent coke and good dope but its #3 and I am not too good with #3...either way its theExchange you should try them out<br />but in all seriousness....the best dope is here in the US and it only takes about 7 days to get some to the UK

I already have posts on reddit and another forum that I will not mention here as there are many of us that have gotten together and started posting experiences with various vendors and we do not want vendors a part of our forum so that it can not be corrupted by phony reviews....anyways, I do have a huge following elsewhere...but I have just begun to post here in the SR forums ;) I CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAVE HAD MANY GREAT EXPERIENCES HERE, BUT IT IS SAD HOW MANY BAD DEALS I HAVE HAD AND I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU AVOID THIS<br /><br />here is the breakdown of the GOOD BAD and UGLY<br />*quality is based off my tolerance and to put that into perspective, my normal IV dose is 0.05-0.1 g of street gear so I am not a heavy user, but I am not a light user either<br /><br />A+ VENDORS!!<br />MARLO...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shipping- superfast!!!
