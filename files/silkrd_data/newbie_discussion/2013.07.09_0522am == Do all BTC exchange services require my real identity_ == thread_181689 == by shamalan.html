				I am trying to remain as anon as possible with this. Are there any verified services (similar to Mt.Gox) I can buy/trade bitcoins without having to post my address information, real name etc? Am I not able to purchase BTC off of prepaid debit cards with USD value?<br /><br />Fuck you - this is the newb forum right?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				Hi, I use bitinstant like I always have. Just had to actually sign up. Did it in fake real name. Just make sure you know there real date of birth. Also you have to answer about 5 questions to confirm you are the person you are saying. Just pick a friend of FB. Normally their DOB is posted. Just make sure you think you can answer the questions. Its normally like what year did you graduate, have you ever lived at this address. All multichoice. I got it done first try with first person I picked. Its easy. Hope that helps.

				If your in the Uk i find Bitbargin a good site you can use the ping it (Barclay phone app even if you don&#039;t have a account with them). Also shows you the Mt.Gox exchange rate so you can compare the rate the seller is putting on top&nbsp; of the actual going rate usually around 5-10 quid more then Mt.Gox.

				No, and it&#039;s probably best that you don&#039;t use your real name or any other potentially identifying details.&nbsp; There is more and more speculation lately that the next &quot;war&quot; the government will start will be against bitcoin...&nbsp; &nbsp;This may or may not be so - I personally figure it probably is true.&nbsp; But regardless, to be on the safe-side, it&#039;s really much better to use fake info and buy BTC from somewhere that accepts cash transfers like Western Union or Money Gram.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure on Money Gram regarding if they ask for your ID at a specific cut-off amount, but am pretty sure that you can transfer up to $999.99 with Western Union and they won&#039;t ask you for an ID.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you use BitInstant, you will have to give them some info - I think they ask for a First and Last name, DOB, address, phone number, email address to make the account with them that they are just as of recent requiring. Idk why htown said you need to steal someone elses identity to use fake info.<br /><br />I made my account with them using info just off the top of my head and doubt that all of it together matches any one person.&nbsp; The only thing you have to make sure of is that when you fill in the MoneyGram payment form, you use the exact same inforrmation that you used when you created your account with BitInstant or it won&#039;t process.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that info doesn&#039;t have to be your real info or anybody elses info.&nbsp; Your account info simply has to match what info you put on your MG payment form. Period.<br /><br />[EDIT]&nbsp; The only thing that needs to be real is the email address because they send you some info you need to your email.&nbsp; I made a new free webmail address with the same info I used to make my BitInstant account and only use that address for that one purpose.

It&#039;s simple enough to do, but it&#039;s not something that would be obvious to just notice on your own.....<br /><br />O.K. so, what you do, is go to where you have your public key posted in the forum thread &quot;Post PGP Keys Here&quot; I think it&#039;s called.&nbsp; And right above the post, you will see what you see above every single post you make anywhere.&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t know where your public key is, I&#039;ll use the info from your post you made here to get you a url that would point to it.&nbsp; The concept works for any post.. including your PGP key.<br /><br />Right above your post here is this bit of info (copied/pasted to here):<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Re: Do all BTC exchange services require my real identity?<br />« Reply #6 on: Today at 03:30 pm »<br /><br />So, you highlight those two short lines, right click, then left-click on&nbsp; &nbsp;View Selection&nbsp; Source.&nbsp; A page like this should open up:<br /><br />&lt;div class=&quot;keyinfo&quot;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class=&quot;messageicon&quot;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/Themes/default/images/post/xx.gif&quot;

When you do this yourself on your PGP key post, you will notice that part of the code is highlighted in blue.&nbsp; When I copy/pasted it to here, it lost the highlighting.&nbsp; (just fyi).<br />Anyway, all you do to get the link to the post, is you go&nbsp; down a couple - three lines to where you see the one that starts with <br /><br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;http://dknxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx...............&quot;<br /><br />this along with some other stuff will be part of what is highlighted in blue..&nbsp; &nbsp;you want the part of that entry that has the beginning I just put above this sentence that starts at http://&nbsp; (without the quote right before it).&nbsp; So, click anywhere on the page to get rid of the highlighting and then begin highlighting where I just said, and here&#039;s all of what you need to highlight .&nbsp; This is what the link to your post here will be (you can test it):<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181689.msg1321676#msg1321676<br /><br />and when you get the link to your PGP key, it will look similar, but will have different numbers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Copy/paste it to your forum profile page in he signature area, and it will be the link to your PGP Key.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope that helped :)
