				i put an order in on thursday, it still says processing and there doesnt seem to be a way for me to cancel my order or finalize it. my bitcoins seem to be in escrow(usd). there is the word cancel in my order section but i cannot click on it, as well i sent the vendor 2 messages but he has not even read them yet. i thought as soon as i placed an order i would have the options to finalize (it just says &quot;auto finalize N/A&quot;) or cancel it. does this only happen when the order status changes from &quot;processing&quot; to &quot;in transit&quot; or should i have those options from the beginning? I just want to know ill be able to save my bitcoins if this guy doesn&#039;t end up mailing the package, he has pretty awesome reviews though don&#039;t really know why he wouldnt wanna make 300 bucks.

				Yes I think you can only finalize once it is in transit, you should be able to cancel after a certain amount of days. 4 if I remember correctly?<br />I also think the waiting times for finalizing are longer for new vendors to prevent scams. <br />You wont be able to save your coins if you finalize, so beware, stay safe, beware of ultimatums and don&#039;t get greedy.

				Finalize option is only available once it&#039;s &quot;in transit&quot; ..Cancel becomes available after the 4 day grace period for the vendor to ship out is done. Put the mouse arrow over &quot; cancel &quot; and it should tell you how many days is left till it&#039;s available.
