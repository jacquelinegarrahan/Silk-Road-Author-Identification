				Along time ago I noticed that drinking milk shortly after dropping L seemed to almost nullify the effects. We started avoiding dairy products until we wanted to come down, Milk also seemed to shorten a trip in progress.<br />Has anyone else ever noticed these effects or were we jusy way off and tripping?

				no you&#039;re right. I&#039;ve been told you want to avoid dairy with lsd and mushrooms. i feel like it had been explained to me at the time.. but I can&#039;t remember the reason. i&#039;m sure the internet might have an answer or two

				Maybe because dairy is more base than acidic? But I thought acidity would only matter in the case of mushrooms and not LSD. I&#039;ve never heard this hypothesis before but it seems to me like dairy wouldn&#039;t change anything unless you&#039;re sensitive to it and it caused some discomfort during the trip. Just my two cents.

				i think it comes down more to the human digestive response to milk and contraindication with the milk fats and the drugs.. not sure though, I&#039;m kind of just fumbling about an old memory
