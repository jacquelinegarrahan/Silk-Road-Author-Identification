				My reason for asking is that I have not seen my package yet and he required all people to FE with a new product he was trying-I have not received and I was wondering if anyone else who ordered--I see approx. 5-has received their order.&nbsp; -I ordered the 28th and it said in transit--Then 4 days later I got a note I needed to FE and everyone had to regardless of status--He has been around 9 months with decent stats--It looked like he was OK by the stats,&nbsp; Now I am concerned by a couple of things....he&#039;s got no more products listed, hasn&#039;t been on in 4 days, and I haven&#039;t received my product.&nbsp; I would have posted this in the H area but I am still a newbie with 30 posts...thanks for your feedback<br /><br />PS...HOW MANY DAYS TILL THE RESOLVE BUTTON WORKS?

				I have had a $1000 order with skippy a couple of months ago, then out of nowhere he was asking me to FE. This guy does send product at times. <br />But I get the feeling he is only there half the time, very flaky. I would not FE and I am glad I didn&#039;t, product never arrived but I got all my money back. Keep in mind that before and during resolution he was telling me he had sent the package, yet he was not providing a tracking number for it, his word meant very little to me after that and I started to choose other vendors.<br /><br />It was a couple of months ago but sounds dodgy to me, be careful.

				When i first started on SR, i wanted to place a bulk order with him and a few days later he told me i would have to FE. I didnt reply to him, because i wasnt going to order anything form him if i had to FE, later he kept messaging me telling me if i was going to order from him, because he made the tabs, and now he needed to sell them. <br /><br />i just found that very sketchy and his rush for me to place an order and FE no matter what. Thats why i never placed it.
