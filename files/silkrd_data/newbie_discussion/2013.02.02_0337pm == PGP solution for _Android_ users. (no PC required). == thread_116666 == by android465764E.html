				So I was informed recently that the online PGP method - igolder, is probably not as secure as one would like. <br />So, I sought out a better method. Can never be too careful. <br /><br />It seems that setting up PGP on a PC is a relatively simple affair. No such luck for people without a computer.<br /><br />I have however, found a method for Android OS users which requires not much stress at all. If you already know how to do this, groovy. If you don&#039;t, read on.<br />I present these instructions in the hope that anyone else who is having Android dilemmas, can benefit. <br /><br /><br /><br />1. Download an app called &quot;APG&quot; by Thialfihar, from the market.<br /><br />2. Download a decent notepad app, one that doesn&#039;t have a character limit. &quot;Jota Text Editor&quot; is a good one.<br /><br />3. Go to the seller&#039;s profile, and copy their PGP key to your clipboard.<br /><br />4. Open Jota, and paste the clipboard contents into a new document.<br /><br />5. Save the document as a *.pgp file. <br /><br />ie, when you hit save, change the extension from .txt to .pgp - so it looks like this..&nbsp; VendorName.pgp (obviously, substitute vendorname for the actual seller&#039;s name). <br /><br />6. Open APG. Click..&nbsp; <br />Menu&gt;Manage Public Keys&gt;Import Keys <br />Next, browse for the file you just saved in Jota, and click it. Then click OK.<br /><br />7. Press the &quot;back&quot; key on your phone, and click &quot;Encrypt Message&quot;. <br /><br />8.&nbsp; Type your address (or whatever info you&#039;re encrypting) into the white box. <br /><br />9.&nbsp; Press the &quot;select&quot; button next to the words &quot;Public Key(s)&quot;. On the next screen, select the vendor&#039;s key, and press OK.<br /><br />10. Next, press &quot;Encrypt to Clipboard&quot;. <br /><br />11. You will see a pop-up with a message saying the encryption was successful.<br />Now go to SR, and dump your clipboard in the appropriate place during checkout. (the bit that asks for your address).&nbsp; <br /><br />Done!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As I&#039;m still new at SR and willing to take advice, I think it&#039;s useful to reciprocate and share methods and techniques. <br /><br />Chances are, if I struggled with something, someone else probably did too.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So there it is.<br /><br />A PGP solution for Android.<br /><br />The APG app is only just out of beta, but I&#039;ve tested it with Android 2.3.4 and above. Seems to work fine. <br />

				Ever heard of CarrierIQ?&nbsp; Look it up.&nbsp; Was a big scandal, almost all the major carriers were using it in the US: it&#039;s just an example of the sort of thing happening on your phone that you have no idea about.<br /><br />The problem with Android is that it&#039;s partially designed to keep control away from you, and in the hands of the carriers.&nbsp; That&#039;s not so good.&nbsp; Is APG better than no encryption?&nbsp; Well, sure, I suppose so.&nbsp; But you&#039;ve got the same problem as iGolder.com, in the end -- a third party can conceivably defeat the encryption with ease if they choose to.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure whether or not they actually have monitoring software intrusive enough to do so depends on the ROM you use, but Android is fundamentally insecure unless you really, really know what you&#039;re doing.

				I do know of CarrierIQ. My phone doesn&#039;t have it. I&#039;m rooted, and beleive me I know how about custom ROMs and that carrier IQ shit.<br />There&#039;s a simple app online that can identify if you have it, and removing (as-well as other system bloatware) is a simple process.<br /><br />But thanks for bringing it up. Every little helps when it comes to security.
