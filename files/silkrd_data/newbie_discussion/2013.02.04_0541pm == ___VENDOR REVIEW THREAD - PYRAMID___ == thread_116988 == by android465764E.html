				UK only vendor. <br /><br />Profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d060276701 <br /><br />Currently selling MDMA crystal.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />I am not Pyramid.<br />I am merely a happy customer, they don&#039;t have a review thread, so thought I&#039;d start one.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Ordered 1g crystal MDMA on a Saturday, product arrived on Monday. Not too shabby!&nbsp; <br /><br />Product is lovely, nice clean high.<br />Took 150mg for breakfast, at about 10am, topped up by 50mg at 3pm.<br />It&#039;s now 5.30pm and I&#039;m still buzzing.<br /><br />Hats off to these folks for a good product and lightning quick delivery. <br /><br />Will definitely be ordering from these chaps again.

				Thanks for the review android! Been debating either getting some from a UK vendor, or getting twice as much for my money from one of the Netherlands vendors (but risking it getting stomped on by Customs). Since it sounds like good stuff, I think I&#039;ll play it safe and go for pyramid this time. Will add my review in a few days when I get it ;)

				The morning after. <br /><br />So, I spent most of yesterday enjoying this crystal. Every couple of hours I&#039;d shave off a few shards and just wash it down with some water. <br /><br />At about 2am I decided it was time for bed.<br />I took 75mg of diphenhydramine (otc sleeper, Nytol etc.. ) And within about an hour, I was ready for sleep. No drama.<br /><br />Woke up at 10am today, feel fine. Certainly some of the crystal is my system, but I don&#039;t feel high, I don&#039;t feel groggy, no E-hangover etc..&nbsp; <br /><br />Great stuff indeed.<br /><br />In the UK? Need domestic-only mdma crystal? Go see this guy.<br /><br /><br />Ok, arse-licking over now, lol. Just wanted to review the whole experience. ★

				Ordered a gram off Pyramid in preparation for last night (Saturday), it came immediately the next day in the morning with the mail, looked very inconspicuous and very nicely packaged inside, was a pleasure to open.<br /><br />There was a chunk of crystal, very little to no powder when opening it, which, in my opinion is very good. Looked very high quality stuff.<br /><br />Made myself a small bomb to start off, around 0.2grams. About 40minutes later it finally hit me, and boy did it hit me. I felt incredibly buzzed, incredibly talkative and in an incredibly loving mood, which normally doesn&#039;t happen to me unless i&#039;ve taken around 0.7-0.8grams, so this was an incredibly refreshing feeling. Almost felt like my first time on MD again.<br /><br />I remember checking the time on my watch, 2:17am, then going off to dance for around 3 hours. Checked the time again since I was pretty beat, 2:27am. Mother of god. It really made time slow down and fast forward at random intervals.<br /><br />I would also highly recommend receiving hugs from people, or if you can manage to convince someone, a head massage. I have never felt such pure bliss, that I did receiving a head massage with Pyramid&#039;s Mandy.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t buying already, then I highly recommend you do!

				Placed an order late tonight and was doing a very quick browse on the road when I realised it had already been marked as in transit. Hoping for it to arrive Friday! Already seems like a very good operation, and this will hopefully lead to a very prosperous future between us! ;) Somebody&#039;s gonna have to sort me out for this summer (and the rest of the years haha) and all the &#039;big names&#039; I&#039;d shortlisted have pulled their stock atm, so I found pyramid and they look to have a very loyal and appreciative fanbase. Decent price, still at least a tenner cheaper than street price and probably a lot cleaner to boot.<br /><br />Looking forward to sampling the product soon and I assure you I will be reporting back!<br /><br />Peace and good vibrations to all! :)

				Ordered from Pyramid last night and received this morning - I can&#039;t believe how fast it showed! The MDMA is white and looks like the picture in the listing. Looks like Reich&#039;s MDMA which I reviewed recently, which was great; hoping this is too! Doesn&#039;t have a smell to it either, so should be quite potent [as far as you can tell from looking/smelling]. Tests positive with a reagent kit.<br /><br />Pyramid has been very friendly as well, which goes a very long way as far as I&#039;m concerned. Definitely recommended!

				Thread has been quiet for a while, but I wanted to put in a word for Pyramid. His MDMA has always come to me as all crystal and in excellent stealth packaging. In comparison to other domestic MDMA sellers, Pyramid&#039;s will always be top. I haven&#039;t got access to lab testing at all, but this is definitely 80-84% pure, with a lovely dutch flavour and no smell. I found that I didn&#039;t tweak on the comedown at all, a problem I had with subtickle and JOR&#039;s MDMA, and a standard vitamin supplement and 5-HTP minimised and mood lows.<br /><br />Pyramid, if you&#039;re reading this, thanks for the love!

				Promised Pyramid I would come back and leave a review of his mandy.&nbsp; So I ordered 1g and it came very quickly after the initial order - next day service and all in rocks, a little overweight and tasted absolutely minging.&nbsp; I was very much looking forward to the weekend so I could bosh it and have a rave with some good friends.<br /><br />Anyways, Saturday came and I dished out a few doses for friends and ate the rest to myself over the course of the evening.&nbsp; The mandy seemed very clean and strong.&nbsp; I came up within half an hour and was feeling very happy, loved up and full of energy.&nbsp; Had a naughty gurn on all night and it had a very smooth come down.&nbsp; This mandy comes recommended, my friends all seemed to enjoy it as well...<br /><br />
