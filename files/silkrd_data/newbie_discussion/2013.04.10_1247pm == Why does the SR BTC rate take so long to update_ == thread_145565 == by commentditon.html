				Do they use the exchange rate of another market besides Mt.Gox or something? Right now my account is being shorted $40, driving the price on the item I want to purchase up to something completely unreasonable. How long will I have to wait before it catches up? Will it ever? I&#039;m already hesitant to spend my coins with the way BTC has been shooting up, and this is further dissuading me.&nbsp;
