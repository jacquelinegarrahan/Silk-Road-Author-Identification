				been using it for a couple of months now.&nbsp; its good if youre domestic (USA).&nbsp; theyre based out of atlanta, so if youre on the east coast or southeast, this could be a great option.<br /><br />pros: if sending $1000 or less/day, no need to do a kyc.<br />money credited in 5-6 days after sending (2-3 days processing)<br />usually below mt.gox prices<br /><br />cons: commission increases price slightly<br />if the coins are very volatile in price at that time, they may fill your order in smaller portions (had an $800 order split into about 10-12 smaller orders and done over 8 hours)<br /><br />if you have any other questions, ask away.<br /><br />peace, love, drugs<br />mixmasterrick

				I almost used them and I heard good things about them but I used Virvox.com. I would strongly advised against using VirVox.com they make you wait 48 hours to transfer funds with new accounts which I think is lame with the high ass fees they charge.

				I think campbx you send a money order. I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re slow though; I mean they would get the money order in 2 days but then take 4 days to give the coin. Maybe making sure the money order is legit; not sure.

				CampBX uses Dwolla, P2P bank Transfers from major banks, Personal Check and Money Orders. Dwolla transfers are instant, the rest I can&#039;t vouch for.

				I&quot;ve used campbx for almost all of my 18 transactions....works well.&nbsp; Like a previous poster said, Dwolla &amp; Campbx have something going on, similar to Spotify &amp; Facebook.&nbsp; Link a dwolla account to your bank account and do a transfaer.&nbsp; It won&#039;t cost anything to add funds.&nbsp; It&#039;s take 4 days (if you&#039;re in the US).&nbsp; I tend to move money on sunday nites, after a party filled weekend, so my dwolla account is funded when I feel the need to indulge.&nbsp; Once in Campbx, when you choose to Fund from Dwolla (cost a quarter) it&#039;ll kick off a Dwolla Interface used to verify your identity.&nbsp; Fund will show up almost instantaneously.&nbsp; Once you have them, you can buy your bitcoins at the market price (which is what I do) as I&#039;m not interested in trying to time my trades.&nbsp; Be sure only to buy bitcoins for exactly what you&#039;re eyeballing on SR.&nbsp; If you move $500.00 cash into Bitcoins but only want to buy $200.00 bucks worth of tomoatoes, you run the risk of your coins losing their value &amp; purchasing power.&nbsp; Conversely you could find that your coins are worth dramatically more than you even began with?&nbsp; Too volatile for my liking.<br /><br />good luck.<br /><br />mojo
