				It can take an hour or two. You must have at least 6 confirmations on your transaction by the bitcoin network before it will appear in your account.<br /><br />You can check this by putting the address into blockchain.info and then looking at the associated transaction. After you have 6 confirmations it should show up in about 15 minutes or so.

				The whole process from trading non-digital-money to bitcoins to your wallet, maybe 2 days.<br /><br />One bitcoin transaction is about 5 to 20 minutes.

				Up to 3 hours once it is sent to your SR account.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fastest I have seen it happen is an hour.&nbsp; It&#039;s best to transfer and do something else for a few hours.&nbsp; &nbsp;It kinda sucks refreshing tor over and over to see if it deposited.&nbsp; &nbsp;ADVICE:&nbsp; Never go into a SR transaction in a hurry.&nbsp; You will only piss off your vendor leave yourself disappointed!&nbsp; I try to order and forget about it, although I&#039;m sure everybody has been guilty of feeling like Christmas morning when you see the mailman coming, LOL!

				A simple guide on how to check your transfer status.<br /><br />* In Tor Browser go to blockchain.info<br />* Put the address you have sent the transfer to in the search box<br />* You should then have a page called &#039;Bitcoin Address&#039;<br />* On that page will be a list of transactions, normally you should only see one (assuming you create a new SR bitcoin address for each transaction, which you should do...). With a green arrow indicating funds were sent TO that address.<br />* Click the transaction id, the really long string of characters. You will then see one of these things:<br />** Estimated confirmation time - This means no-one has yet confirmed the transaction on the network, the estimate is how long it expects for the transaction to receive the first confirmation.<br />** Confirmations - The number of times the transaction has been confirmed on the network. Your SR wallet will update soon after you have received 6 confirmations<br /><br />
