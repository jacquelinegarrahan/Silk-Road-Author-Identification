				Hi there folks I&#039;m a bitcoin vendor and it was suggested by a friend to post in here as it&#039;s not just full of new people, it&#039;s people who have been around a while but don&#039;t spend much time on forums.<br /><br />I sell bitcoins for a very cheap amount, offer not only a postal service but also a direct bank service, done via internet banking or going into the branch and paying into the account. And the coins show up before you can say &quot;lickity-split&quot;, as I send them to your Silk Road username rather than to a wallet address, and this method means that the coins are yours within....oh about 10 seconds tops ? :D<br /><br /><br /><br />My profile says it all really - I also sell a lot of RCs, but this isn&#039;t done by me it&#039;s setup and done after the vendor who put me into business lost his account, so I allow his cousin to work with my account, in exchange I get bitcoins on the cheap, which is why I&#039;m allowed to operate at such low prices!<br /><br /><br />The profile can be seen here http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f76d1ab300 and I&#039;ll also post it below<br />-----------------------<br /><br />Welcome to BitcoinsUK./DrugsUK<br /><br />UPDATES:<br /><br />[ BUKDATE | 28/06/13 ] - Due to an established member conning me, new customers, no matter of the stats, who want to use the postal method WILL NOT receive ANY coins until I receive the cash. If it&#039;s posted before 2pm and you say next day delivery it&#039;ll be less than 24hours you&#039;ll be waiting for the best priced deals on the net!<br />Changes:<br /><br />NO MORE FEES<br /><br />[ BUKDATE | 27/06/13 ] - Ineternet banking is now the preferred mode of cash transfer. BTC is legal and I;m working towards paying taxes etc. If not that, then going into a Natwest branch and paying into the account. You of course can still post if you&#039;d prefer that, just banking methods are quicker and easier for both parties<br /><br />[ DUKDATE | 24/06/13 ] - Ethylphenidate is back in stock<br /><br />[ BUKDATE | 24/06/13 ] - BTC is now available in small amounts (woo just got paid so could buy some bitcoins) and we have all setup for postage of money for coins.<br /><br />[ Both | 23/06/13 ]&nbsp; &nbsp; - Someone brought to my attention that my postage doesn&#039;t include Canada. Sorry, the one that says US should be used, I forgot to include it.<br /><br />[ DUKDATE | 22/06/13 ] - All drugs are now up, and 10g orders of MXE are available but to UK customers only (they&#039;ll be sent as parcels and you don&#039;t need to go into the post office to post UK &gt; UK parcels.<br /><br />[ BUKDATE | 21/06/13 ] - Bitcoins are back up for sale. Only got a few to sell and to existing customers only as will have to be by bank transfer. Repeat customers only as will need to be a bank transfer, maximum £300 as still got 2 people I wanna pay back before BUK becomes &quot;open&quot; to the public<br />PS ALL updates will be signed either DUKdate or BUKdate from now on because I&#039;m so super witty}<br />Rate is whatever weighted average at http://mtgox.com is plus £2 per butcoin<br /><br />20/06/13- This is DrugsUK here. I have added a lot more substances as you can see. They may seem expensive but these are the pure chemicals and hard to get hold of. Please read the listings fully for any added. Also Ethylphenidate has been taken down due to me...losing it. Yep, I can&#039;t find it ANYWHERE! I&#039;ve put another order in for it so I&#039;ll get it up ASAP. Sorry for those orders who were in limbo, I thought I&#039;d find it, but no idea where it is.<br /><br />BitcoinsUK won&#039;t have any bitcoins for general sale for some time, as we have someone who has put it a large order so all profits are going to filling that. Sorry about this.<br /><br />10/06/13 - As a thank you for the support from Tunbear I am now in partnership with the person who took over from his business. I&#039;m still selling bitcoins but all of Tunbear&#039;s stock will be handled by him.<br />This means messages meant for me are to have BUK in the title, and anything for him TB. He will only check his and I&#039;ll only check mine. Sorry been offline so long the...actually nah no more details, it&#039;s one thing I learned from working with him that sharing too much information goes against you. You want coins you can still get them. Any of the drug listings are NOT dealt by me and the partnership works completely anonymously. My same business model will commence as soon as I get access to my old wallets (if I can).<br /><br />Tunbear/his compatriots sent out dozens of orders before his account was closed and it seemed a lot of people decided to take advantage of this. Several deliveries to more dodgy looking people were sent recorded, yet they say they never received them and got 100% feedback, unfortunately due to lack of access it couldn&#039;t be fought.<br /><br />DrugsUK PROFILE:<br /><br />I bought Tunbear&#039;s stock of MXE and legal highs and will be working in partnership with BitcoinsUK as he seemed the only guy Tunbear could trust. Yes we work as a team but we work separate areas, including separate addresses which the other doesn&#039;t know.<br /><br />Apart from the MXE I will also be stocking a variety of legal highs and some cheap buds. I will only be doing small quantities to keep them all fitting into an envelope, no more parcels.<br /><br />My shipping policies are harsh and my reship policies even harsher, please read them fully before ordering!<br />--YOU MUST HAVE 5 PREVIOUS ORDERS ON SILK ROAD OR YOUR ORDER WILL BE CANCELLED! No exceptions, messages will be deleted without being read.<br />--THERE WILL BE ONLY 1 RESHIP ON ANY ITEM, AND WILL ONLY BE SENT AFTER IT IS FINALIZED! This is to stop people holding out on cash<br />BItcoinsUK will run his own business, just label any messages to me with DrugsUK and his with BitcoinsUK in the title.<br /><br />My PGP KEY:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.19 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFG2S5cBCAC0H5Js+b1vLBQeKGvqOKN0RWfIac1PoTSlibY3MFy/oDALjrvP<br />lsJL4AOpDi5/Hci2CKT9rsPCghnpG1doAQRUVG2jwJWrFMO2+zsW9m51czsYyxxa<br />o64SD9N3h1R6vgwtICpafNgJoeFLNtxzSgDQeqE+91MmT60AFimnDac5jyaxYo6z<br />lsLzY2Ff9YQLIh9ewtzbUnefNa/ZCjpLpie0m0YGTHT9zmuNfonxxMYfuwPVsPKH<br />MB6m4pWddPU9h1V5/S7EBNNSQVTlOIfHebShJE3TM35Fm/LPzE1f/hgemCgeIW5D<br />jfZcV8wIn9oir7QgyvcRvs0rtlBGPtjOZcnJABEBAAG0CUJVSy1EcnVnc4kBOAQT<br />AQIAIgUCUbZLlwIbAwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQQRaGePjn<br />Zkcmnwf9E1SvI4lbE7VjrjNscnlGkArSpUSgXQ+ljgOJLrZurz88NBCgp6jbRMUE<br />SSM85TCGyQh3S3Y3/lWDrlifzLwx+u4vQIYWAQdZpfgR534enyka6moGEf5i1tH8<br />9HDIaR7ACpbCWVktHEGAcqs66GKmjyBcIR2/iq5px3DxzYtoJ7+1c0bQuetRNbJs<br />GbrZi7pLm2x7eW8vC43AjVuozPH6DAgfcNyvDlk3jHYlIhNZEukt4LViFsLufA82<br />xg7ecGcZtnHcFWTDmrwRf2NOgaZC6iwXnyzURICoDUw6S96vDXARRM2kTqlcRZbG<br />smO54LFA+ZaCS30FMGe7No7tjAGo+rkBDQRRtkuXAQgAwL9FyqX9YswzQDczJiIb<br />yfzL19vpCEfHYHCyHCvgitUNdWo7TcEblV5FN48Ib2dGl4WxDRBQ85c9c5UKPr9N<br />Pk6fpBKD63FWggfmuZcw3QlS9xyBb7MDlK7IvZyHuAU2GbqwqhPk+t6w0ezXjb2P<br />B/Jy6L15Gcr28aZZVS6FJ3y/BnJVFwxZq979rS0rFdzPdLxUrBfWzkhkYKu+FKOy<br />Xz110gbQwDDENedeInqax0yvyCum6/AhoQgF8nF9yu4+bmTQrQEUoP3eBdl8eR5y<br />FmhYEPYlrSstsODKlKMt9DTrs+iE9ZtuofLhTIO+BSG8oZRM+XPBq7nLiEPzyhoA<br />pwARAQABiQEfBBgBAgAJBQJRtkuXAhsMAAoJEEEWhnj452ZHB1gH/iaBMuGEy+Un<br />8lOQtxhurzSBb9JBACWca/tW4vYgY29B/t5QdBT/1PDtnW4mcgnZr79qoHlGr9NL<br />t0PNF7w+COXqzfVzrcMm0arY9IzpwXgNNslasSzodzwyIY4p/dN28MInJGoBuLg8<br />UzOtvS2Jd2RBK5wYrpcvHbojdgS9YeICXpARE2Tp7TG57k8nQCLmLJMNQj9HC+S1<br />S7iywFe7Gyiupw1jQMeuz9rJZyNeKLPRXR2IixTSepMU6hFQUUhbXbcBMBjRDakN<br />69qltowEe41ccxdQQ++2E2+j1HJT83oZhrINyz0nxf0wZFaPEo+RhROdgMJAC/H/<br />KypRXUYsOTY=<br />=tBQQ<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />====================================================<br /><br />[ Buying and selling bitcoins ]<br /><br /><br />You can purchase bitcoins either through the post or via online bank transfer<br />Bank transfers are completely safe - selling bitcoins is perfectly legal and even if it wasn&#039;t they&#039;re not gonna go through all my different bank details to find ppl buying something from me that is legal!<br /><br />YOU MUST BE A MEMBER FOR AT LEAST 2 MONTHS AND SPENT $200 TO USE MY SERVICE!<br /><br />New Customers, regardless of stats (minimum 2 months membership):<br /><br />To purchase through the post, coins will NOT BE RELEASED until I receive the post. It must still be posted next day delivery with tracking, and I get the tracking number, so if I&#039;m low on coins I know not to sell them to someone else.<br /><br />After 3 transactions (10 transactions if a member for less than 6 months), half the coins (up to a maximum of £200) will be released when I get the tracking number, the rest when I receive the cash<br /><br />In the event that only half the Bitcoins were released to you, the other half will be released at a RECALCULATED RATE. 99% of the time it won&#039;t matter, but the amount outstanding will be recalculated upon when I get the rest of the money.<br /><br />Paying using High Street/Internet banking.<br /><br />What happens is I give you a Sort Code and Account # (and my phone number for quicker communication) and you transfer a test payment of £1. If your online banking suppports what most people&#039;s in the UK then it will show up instantly. The £1 will be reimbursed when you buy coins.<br /><br />You then say how much you are transferring across and I let you know how many BTC you would get.<br />If you&#039;re buying a lot and are a bit wary of me, I am quite happy to do it in chunks of whatever you&#039;re comfortable with, minimum of £100/time. If you&#039;re buying several thousands worth I&#039;m only willing to do it 5 times, so you could do 1 coins worth, then 3, then 10, then 20, then the rest it&#039;s up to you, hell do it 1 4 times but by the 5th you need to send all the cash.<br /><br />If you instead want to it via the counter, you&#039;ll again get the details and you go into your nearest branch of whichever bank I&#039;m using at the time, pay it in (you don&#039;t need to do a test paymentm as long as it&#039;s the right bank it always goes in instantly when paid at the counter NOT AT THE DROP SLOTS!) then either text or ring me to let me know, or message me on SR if you prefer and I&#039;ll move the coins across :)<br /><br />[ Cost Of Bitcoins ]<br /><br /><br />https://mtgox.com/index.html?Currency=GBP look at the top, the last number, the weighted average, that + the fee stated below.<br /><br />The price structure and postal rules are changing. Before reading these remember several things - <br /><br />[1] I don&#039;t charge commission on sales, I don&#039;t charge fees of any kind, be it per bitcoin or per transaction, I don&#039;t charge fees for withdrawing your money like a lot of places do!<br />[2] Your coins arrive within SECONDS of me receiving payment, and if the arrangement is done via online banking, from asking to getting your coins could be done IN LESS THAN A MINUTE! Hell even if your bank isn&#039;t instant the most it takes to show up on my side is 30mins or so.<br />[3] If you pay the money OTC (over the counter), by that point you&#039;ll have my work number so can contact me, and when it&#039;s paid at a counter it shows up instantly so by the time you get home you&#039;ll have your coins...and if you didn&#039;t want to phone me, it&#039;s still only a few seconds of me getting your message<br />[4] If you&#039;re the especially paranoid type and want to go via post, if you pop it in the post before 2pm it has a 99% chance of getting to me the next day! Because of a recent scammer, people will no longer have any coins released before I&#039;ve seen the money; it seems people will destroy their rep over such a small amount of money. And as you have the tracking number too you can feel safe knowing you have proof that it arrived to me! After 5 postal transactions you then have the option to have half the funds up front. This also applies to people who have already established a relationship with me, you still get it. Unfortunately the limit is £200.<br />[5] You know whatever the market is, you won&#039;t pay much more than it; not only is it hard to find people selling at market prices because they want to bring the value up, whilst only finding really low offers as people try to bring it down and/or force high volume sellers to lower their prices, in either case exchanges cost more, but for those who buy in bulk it&#039;s impossible to find anyone who has that many coins selling at anywhere near the market price as they are especially interested in keeping the market price high.<br />[6] If buying/selling large volumes of bitcoins you can get all your money in 1 go, instead of the limits most places set, whilst paying additional withdrawal costs,<br /><br />#5 &amp; 6 are especially important - #5 because it&#039;s getting harder and harder to find coins for a fair price - people are trying to manipulate the prices, to either lower raise the market, and/or force bulk sellers to stop trying to sell for WAY over their value, and bulk buyers are trying to keep the market high,<br />#6 affects how much you pay especially if you&#039;re a high volume customer - say you managed to sell off a load of coins, you&#039;ve paid a boatload in transaction fees, especially if multiple clients were involved, and then you&#039;ve got to withdraw it; most places have not only a daily withdrawal limit, but a monthly limit before they contact authorities and/or ask for ID. And each time you withdraw you pay a fee for that, and if it&#039;s going from say euros to pounds they charge you for that as well!<br /><br />Soooooo with that in mind the prices are gonna change - I was conned out of £300 and it could have ruined my business<br /><br />New prices are set by how much you&#039;re spending instead of per bitcoin:<br /><br /><br />BTC ARE NOW PRICED AS MARKET<br /><br /><br />[Other Information]<br /><br />I will not haggle over the prices, ANY ATTEMPT to haggle over the set prices will mean ANY further messages will be deleted without looking at them. I make very little money per deal so don&#039;t waste my time.<br />You can message me on here or the forums, and once you become a customer you&#039;ll get my telephone number<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.19 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFEPibIBCAC7+aSq984R9PfLNQCXhHnSIDrY1W6CnA/ZR2i87lWDES94DRxZ<br />bsNPQBqk2gN5uKQBBm2L7MVUvjgHEHkY3xPkCLr7KEmvefSOrwacS57cC15ir//6<br />voUjBlEqfc/HMRuaMEDKcG9FIVUUhGZFXANVnJyVa8IXdTncYie9QZiPGWqEyMpG<br />TapeZZ+RAwPC6hmp4peNIWF5Q3R0+UVIV0bl7DbxjufhGSPxNLcwJHk3OX8335Jy<br />LgB3gignijGwaLFlJDyDgckiU2rrRmwKE80GeqrD/mO9ZiML1rU6iwe7vJLKXj6x<br />zj7hyHWL5IlVhCM8YiGBaSSb9Sb6FW/LNCNNABEBAAG0CkJpdGNvaW5zVUuJATgE<br />EwECACIFAlEPibICGwMGCwkIBwMCBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJENxqtLM9<br />4HpxhxoH/3ulujKWBS5WpbZxnOCdw0xeF9ZSK1ItVhYr6E5pbhKlikbI/GCNRrFt<br />lV1nQmS+f2+pDsD32AdYySvBQxCzLllW+5sJVCcJWLVGOnPAmdlS7qr3G4qA6D0J<br />ywVt+lAsk9KBGN1J4wKPpU8guosdL0JuWp9MpbWbJQub23zSOgq1PIXAXJ5qhdJ0<br />TjaxjDe40xiSbdvuYwN8sRrGf/f2q1KtV1Xg2n+IfoMu2sRwE7L53UKBWsv8jvn+<br />4m6y4QksGeANxgFBcYXZpNvcnsgoyf+3Dr0QhMPL7CdqLcbi3QSfcgEj81P2G1Cy<br />ladFrtzQnWoNL9gmgSNgFfWCEuqe86i5AQ0EUQ+JsgEIAMdssIJjvHJx4EUPiUoT<br />o8ukrZAhNhXtNUqvBOFJSkIpNTeywh2K7I/tmJL8kosfxWiIr3q7iKeh2FD3ftpa<br />OJVPh8Fg3HE6NWkZQnsbuamvFTUGN1yylQOmMxhKsm+x985iUxFtqBcWah2Z/WRV<br />TzrsbPLEGp1kszRzNjksYAKkm5LNxqGLgrLKr5UUL327ccLFUaBLQiaXwoxG6k21<br />yEuK0p41Uw/kUQXYWfekvumHZsf3W6wX57JDHklWhqKZdR2Ficng8gNDXW1y0B6K<br />3CcsBbLWc4DV9VRoWIcxNdSAK2kSyEl5mGUJtmsSDvt9a/+jta1T0+QPcu8Vg18n<br />6isAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUCUQ+JsgIbDAAKCRDcarSzPeB6cYbrB/9RBI/DCAxY<br />fVFY6AbGm72tbB++Y2FMvJ6Ne8jpqVD8GVEUb4d0ULQ54fC0tOgqTWUvFO9rHizs<br />srJBlQaLwZSILlnH+s+5CfV/S+p7/YSNh7L2xG2lJVDdTxg8cdUeg8z/vbh2JCzn<br />tCZ0iXAEyJiOEDRrD6n9EfQarIibuN3t12P3iIcZlqeaF/0d10yalRxvKkHubEPY<br />ri1/lXtZARyDC+WzjSMTrVv9xow8g28SxGf6ThAgWik1WMcDpcxbiPMgKcbVHOFr<br />MaSLVQkBKnqSS6f5uDiXF90lwFQVAoLLkfLKkQMqI6jKHtI1Dn1nq7FotsgLuLv+<br />kf4taN3N40Jo<br />=Njei<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />So get shopping people and if you ARE new, welcome to Silk Road :)

				Hi folks, just thought I&#039;d report back on my first experience buying BTC within SR. I can&#039;t recommend BitcoinsUK highly enough. <br />The process:<br />-messaged to find out if BTC available<br />-confirmed, sent through test bank transfer of £2.<br />-(then delay on my part, BTCUK was very accomodating)<br />-transferred rest of money, few mins later 2 BTC sitting in my SR account. Whole thing cost me about £2 over Mt Gox value!! Amazing.
