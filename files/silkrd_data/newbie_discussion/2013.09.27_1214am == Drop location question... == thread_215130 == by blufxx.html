				OK, I don&#039;t want anything shipped to my house- out of the question.&nbsp; What are some good ideas for drop locations? Has anyone ever used houses that are sitting empty for sale? Where I&#039;m at there are a ton of houses/foreclosures sitting empty for ages. These houses don&#039;t seem to get any attention for months at a time.&nbsp; I can&quot;t think of any real problems with this barring the unlikely event your shipment comes during a weekend open house or something. Can anyone think of any problems? Seems less conspicuous to me than an abandoned house or something. Anyone have any other ideas?

				You&#039;ll hear a lot of different things here, but I personally use my own home address and real name. I just feel most comfortable this way and what&#039;s less suspicious than that? I only order small personal amounts and I never order internationally, so I feel pretty safe. Honestly I think it&#039;s gonna look a lot more conspicuous for you to be rummaging around in some other house&#039;s mailbox, whether it&#039;s for sale, abandoned or whatever. Also keep in mind that it&#039;s generally the same mailmen on the same route every day so they know what names should be going to what houses. I just wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable doing that but do what makes you feel safest...<br /><br />I read a post the other day where someone was saying they get their orders delivered to a hotel. They call ahead and be sure they have the package and just act like they&#039;re staying there. Not sure of the details but it seemed to work out for them. Once again, do what makes you feel the most comfortable. This is just what works for me.

				Ooh- I like the hotel idea... I was thinking you could almost fill out one of those mail forwarding cards for the drop house ahead of time so the mailman just thinks someone bought the house. By the time they figure it out you&#039;re gone.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of truth to what you said too about just using your own name and addy- chances are pretty good they aren&#039;t going to give you much notice and it IS a lot less suspicious...

				If you poke around the forums, and trusted vendors page alot of people actually recommend using your real address and your real name. Theres lots of reasons for this because the PI&#039;s actually look for mail out of the norm and thats a good way to have a failed delivery or even a controlled delivery. Honestly SR is pretty damn safe IMO as long as your encrypting your address to the vendor and what not. Do your research first especially about the vendor. As long as you&#039;re not ordering LBS of shit you should be safe you know? Plus vendors are obviously good at what they do, i&#039;ve seen some sneaky shit in my experience ;) Don&#039;t risk not receiving your product, and taking money out of a good vendors pocket by getting a refund for a delivery problem that you created. It takes alot of work for PI&#039;s and piggies to work together to make a CD. They have to first go through millions of things of mail, pick out the fishy ones then they have to then sort through the fishy ones and make a decision based on it manually. On top of that they have to then get a warrant to search the package as its even illegal for them to check your mail, then they have to inform the police who ALSO have to get a warrant and research the address and the person. You&#039;re looking at 1-3 weeks of warrants and shit for them, surely they aren&#039;t going to waste our tax money and their time cracking down on someone who ordered a few grams of a particular substance for their own use IMO. The more paranoid you are, the more likely you are to get caught from my experience think smart, use your heart :)

				I would think a PO Box is the way to go, no?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, for 1/4 &gt;= tree purchases &lt;= 1/2, what size box would be recommended? 3&quot;x5.5&quot;, 5&quot;x5.5&quot;, 11&quot;X5.5&quot;? Thanks in advance.

				P.O. Boxes are supposed to be great although something doesn&#039;t feel right to me walking into a government facility to collect your &quot;goods&quot;, i can see some serious potential to getting trapped you know ;) to be safe i would honestly just get it to your house just make sure you never answer the post man, or sign for ANYTHING. Worst case scenario you have a better chance of running LAWL

The general consensus seems to be that they do have to have a warrant, but only for First Class mail. Supposedly anything else is free game and I hear there are lots of loopholes, something about chemically burning the envelope off or something? Bottom line, for the most part if a cop wants to open your mail, they&#039;re gonna find a way. Once again I&#039;m not totally sure on all the laws but there have been many great, detailed posts about that.<br /><br />In any case, I highly doubt that LE is going to waste their time/resources on anything that&#039;s just small time personal use. They&#039;re mostly looking for packages that are enough to hit you with conspiracy to distribute, etc. rather than simple possession charges.

				Thanks &#039;aghostlyfart&#039; [especially for having me write that&nbsp; :)], and &#039;gnOssos&#039; as well.&nbsp; Although, small town muni post offices seem less like gov&#039;t facilities than do those in cities.&nbsp; I am leaning towards following your advice nonetheless, seeing that at most, I would get delivery but twice a year and a po box seems a waste of money (although, they are surprising super cheap), never mind being an additional hassle.&nbsp; I&#039;m a true casual smoker.&nbsp; Do so only when I&#039;m jamming.&nbsp; Thanks again, sincerely.

				In the shipping section of the forum an intern postal inspector answered lots of questions.<br /><br />PO Boxes you need two forms of ID to set up usually. They can just as easily be used for a CD. Try and stick to personal use amounts. Use a real name, real address. Make it look like regular mail. The smaller, less out of the ordinary it looks the better. You don&#039;t want it to garner ANY extra attention for any reason. Mailmen will notice that a house that hasn&#039;t had mail to it in months suddenly gets packages.<br /><br />Oh, and NEVER, NEVER sign for a package.

				lol not a problem mang :) MOre than happy to help another new member to the community. I would really recommend brushing up on your knowledge of the judicial system and laws for your state. As many others have said before, never sign for a package, or go into the post office for a &quot;lost package&quot; these usually result in a CD. You have the right to DENY anything, if you&#039;re truly still paranoid i would suggest waiting a day or two before you open your package as that fucks their case up even more. If you don&#039;t sign for it, deny having any knowledge about it, and don&#039;t open it it&#039;s going to make things alot easier for you if shit goes south. Make sure when you receive your package to not have any paraphernalia in you&#039;re house if you were to be a victim of CD. LE would have a really hard time proving that you&#039;re even a drug user if you don&#039;t have evidence that you even use the stuff. Just some things to think about :)

				If it clears up any questions I was reading the seller requirements and it says to always ship USPS because they are the only ones who are always required to get a search warrant to open a package. Also it requires sellers to vacuum seal any package that can be detected by canine or otherwise... something like that...
