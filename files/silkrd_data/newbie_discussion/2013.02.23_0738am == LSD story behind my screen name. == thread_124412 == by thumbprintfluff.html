				&nbsp;So back in the early 90&#039;s b4 rainbows were associated with sexuality, I had some friends who were part of the rainbow family. I dropped a 1/4 sheet of acid once b4 and decided I wanted to do a thumbprint= you flip a vial of crystal LSD pressed to ur thumb and rub what sticks into your skin, or mouth.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few of them have done it before.<br />&nbsp; I remember being amazed, and kinda unnerved at how fast it kicked in. It got a little scary at points, but that&#039;s what my fam was there for. The experience was absolutely undescribeable so I won&#039;t bother trying. Religious.<br />&nbsp;Anyay, I had to be babysat for 3 days until I was able to funtion myself. I tripped for about a week total gradually coming back to Earth during that time. It was what they called &#039;fluff&#039; so I knew it was pure/good. Not something you could do in public.<br />&nbsp; Haven&#039;t been able to get it in about 2 years now. And wow did it get expensive! Damb. It would cost me about $50-70 to trip the way I like! Thank goodness those nbomes came out.

				Would you say you are &quot;normal&quot; now?&nbsp; Like, are your cognitive functions the same as before you tried the thumbprint?&nbsp; I have heard accounts of people doing it and never being quite the same afterwards, and not in the good enlightened way.&nbsp; I mean, obviously it would have a deep impact on you and the way you think/feel about things, but was your intelligence, or anything like that effected in anyway?&nbsp;

Seeing walls breathe, trails ect, real spaced out. And yeah had some depression problems. It all completely cleared up after about 5-7 years. I remember having a pain in my head during most of it.<br />&nbsp; Not too long after I stayed clean for quite awhile and became reborn. That lasted a few years and I just had a normal life. The experience itself was very personal. I laughed, cried, begged for my life, learned alot, repented.... It&#039;s not describable so I won&#039;t try.<br />&nbsp; Besides being addicted to opiates now, I&#039;m OK. Back in college with a 3.6 gpa so I guess I&#039;m not too fried. But pretty much since then people say I have a crazy look to me!<br />&nbsp; And who is chinacat? How would I be ripping him off?
