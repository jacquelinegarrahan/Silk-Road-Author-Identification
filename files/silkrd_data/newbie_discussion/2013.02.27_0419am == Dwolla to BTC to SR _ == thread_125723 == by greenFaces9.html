				What&#039;s up everyone. My money should be available in my Dwolla account tomorrow... I was thinking about using BitInstant to send my money to and get BTC from there but apparently the option to send it straight to a BTC Wallet is not available right now, So I was going to use CampBX<br /><br />Is this going to work out ? Can someone correct me on the BitInstant feature and tell me if it is back yet or not ? Do the transfers from Dwolla to your BTC source, then to your SR wallet take more than 24 hours ? <br />Help / suggestions are needed and appreciated thank you !&nbsp; 8)

				I went from Dwolla to Campbx to SR... I heard some bad things about Campbx here and there in regards to when you put in a lot of money, so just be aware of that.<br /><br />But as soon as everything cleared from dwolla, only took about 30 minutes to show up in my campbx account then another 20-30 mins to show up in my SR account. First time doing everything and was super easy. Now I tried coinbase as well so I&#039;ll see how that goes.

				Yes!!! Finally what I have been waiting for !<br />&nbsp;<br />My $$ From Dwolla to CampBX transfered almost instantly, then I used the $$ to purchase BTC, which appeared in my CampBX account almost immediately also.<br /><br />Now I used the address provided in my &quot;Account&quot; tab on SR to send my BTC too, and and it says it is sent and confirmed.<br /><br />So right now I&#039;m waiting for the coins to appear in my SR account !<br />You said 20-30 mins, so I&#039;ll give it a few hours before I start getting worried !
