Especially if they decide to cancel the transaction?<br />4) Why am I being charged for his hedging, on his cancelled order??&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t he be paying for this?!?!

				Your hedging loss went to SR.<br /><br />What happens if vendors does not hedge is this.<br /><br />You put in an order when BTC is $100=1 for .44 BTC, so in essense your .44 BTC is worth $44. If the vendor Hedges then no matter when you release funds or if they cancel you or the vendor would get back $44.00.<br /><br />Now if they are not hedged and when you buy the BTC is $100=1 and you bought for .44 BTC, then if you release funds or they cancel and now the BTC is only worth BTC $50=1 your .44BTC is only worth $22. And same thing with if you went through and finalized.<br /><br />Now you ask why wouldn&#039;t a vendor hedge? Well in the instance that they think BTC&#039;s are going up.<br /><br />If they hedge and when you first bought 1BTC=$100 and you bought .44, then you finalize and 1BTC=$200 then that .44 BTC would give the vendor $88 if they didn&#039;t hedge but if they hedged they would only get $44.<br /><br />Make sense?

				TSCrew, thanks for the response.<br /><br />You stated<br /><br />&quot;If they hedge and when you first bought 1BTC=$100 and you bought .44, then you finalize and 1BTC=$200 then that .44 BTC would give the vendor $88 if they didn&#039;t hedge but if they hedged they would only get $44.&quot;<br /><br />So my hypothetical question is;<br />I place an order for a hedged product for .44btc.&nbsp; The .44btc goes into escrow. While I wait for arrival to finalize, BTC does fluctuate and as in your example above, BTC goes from $100 per to $200 per.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The seller gets .22btc which is $44 , So does SR refund to me .22btc? Or does it keep it for itself?<br /><br /><br />
