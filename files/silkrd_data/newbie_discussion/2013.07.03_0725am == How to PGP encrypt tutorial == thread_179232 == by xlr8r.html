				You see, this is the shit I like. Good stuff, straight up, no bullshit. <br /><br />I always use PGP but especially when I have to talk about the specifics. Oh, wait a minute, this brings back a recent memory ...<br /><br />Strange thing happened to me the other day. I was reading a vendors profile the other day and it said,<br />&quot;I am looking for xxxxx xx xxxxxxxxx&quot;. <br /><br />As it turns out, I happen to have a few lying around plus I have another offer I&#039;d like to speak with the vendor (V) about anyway so I decided to message. But before I did I wanted to read some more of V&#039;s profile. I saw that it said that V wanted &quot;To uphold each and every policy that Silk Road holds it&#039;s users and vendors to.&quot; and so I thought to myself ... I like that. <br /><br />It also said that V wanted, &quot;To maintain the highest level of privacy and anonymity to my customers ...&quot; and so I thought to myself ... I&#039;m really liking this.<br /><br />I read a little more and it said, &quot;Loyalty discipline, reliability and privacy are four things you will always get from me. I do not compromise.&quot; and then I thought to myself ... that&#039;s really cool ... I like the privacy (security too I&#039;m thinking).<br /><br />Then he goes even further to make me like him by stating &quot;If you would like a higher level or privacy when you order put your address in a privnote on privnote.com. It is a special note you write and it gives you a link you can paste in the address area of your order. When you order I will only be able to read the note once then it will self-destruct off of the privnote server. There is also a more secure certified privnote version and can be found here:<br />https://certified.privnote.com/&quot;<br /><br />Almost to the end of V&#039;s profile now and it says, &quot;I do utilize PGP and my key can be found below.&quot;<br /><br />Then, as expected, I see this at the end, &quot;*Make sure I have your public PGP key or this will delay communications. You can send your public key to me separately via message on Silk Road to my inbox so I can have it on hand.&quot;<br /><br />Ok, all that sounds good so I decided to send V a short general message using privnote (which is ok to do per V&#039;s profile) letting V know I want to chat but that I use PGP. I included my public key in the message, copied the privnote link and pasted it in a SR message to V&#039;s box.<br /><br />V wrote me back on SR and said that V doesn&#039;t like to use privnote because it jumbles up the data sometimes and that V doesn&#039;t like to use Tormail because it might be under attack right now and that V also doesn&#039;t like to use PGP right now because V is too busy and that SR messages are good enough because it saves V time.<br /><br />So then I write V back and politely say that I will not use anything but PGP without exception when discussing details of my project I had to offer. I also asked V if V had any proof that Tormail was under attack and if yes then V needed to tell me what it was and also post the info for the community. I also asked V why V&#039;s profile says to use privnote and PGP but then V does not? <br /><br />I never got a response so I deleted the messages and put V on my mental Do Not Contact list.<br /><br />Upon reflection I think to myself ... V was sitting there talking all that shit on V&#039;s profile about &quot;upholding each and every policy&quot; and to maintain the &quot;highest level of privacy and anonymity&quot;&nbsp; and all that bullshit about &quot;loyalty, privacy, blah, blah, blah&quot; and then V craps out and sells out by spitting some kind of blah blah bullshit that V&#039;s too busy for security yippy da doo da day.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about anyone else on here but that stinks and is a wee bit suspect. I don&#039;t care how busy I get ... safety and security will always come first because without that we would not exist.<br /><br />Again, good post. Did I already say I really like it?&nbsp;
