				These cards(moneypak, vanilla reload) are purchased with cash only at ur local Walgreen or CVS and Walt-mart, u buy them with CASH ONLY, just simply tell the people who work at the store to put the amount of money you desire into that care, NOTE ( these cards will have a $5 fee upon purchase so bring extra 5 bucks) then u have a find a trust worthy vendor (my experience MoneyPak Queen and TheMIddleMan are 2 good vendors) u put the MP or the VR code on the shipping address along with the state that you bought the card from into the shipping address, the vendor will process it and then give u the BTC according to the vendors rates.

				ok so sorry for being thick, but if i were to go about using this method i would go to Wal-Mart, CVS, Walgreens etc. etc. and have a sum of money deposited onto one of these re-loadable credit cards. then i would find a trustworthy vendor and then how would they go about processing the money off of it? would i send them the physical card in the mail? sorry completely new to all this

				ok so u got the buying the card part right, after u find a vendor, u have to give them the scratch off code on the back of the card to the vendor, so that they can confirm and process the money on ur card, then they will sent the Bitcoins direct into ur wallet. thats why u must find a trusted vendor to do this.( TheMiddleMan, MoneyPak Queen) these two are my personal to go vendors.
