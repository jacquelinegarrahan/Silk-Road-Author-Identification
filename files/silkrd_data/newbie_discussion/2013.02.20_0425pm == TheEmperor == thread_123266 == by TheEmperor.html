				We have abandoned our previous review thread located in the Rumor Mill in favour of a place where all our customers (even the ones with less then 50 posts) can comment on their experience with us :)<br /><br />Our goal is to provide quality product at a reasonable price with an adequate level of customer service. <br /><br />We welcome constructive criticism or any from of criticism for that matter. Knowing what we may doing wrong or what we could be doing better, will help us improve customer satisfaction in the future.<br /><br />This thread will be checked on frequently by me :) And here is our Vendor page with our current listings - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/06472a4bc0<br /><br />From all the people who are a part of the&nbsp; dedicated team whom make up TheEmperor &amp; co,<br />We wish you all good luck on the lottery....

				Would definitely recommend TheEmperor anyday, good stealth even though it&#039;s just domestic, great shipping times, excellent communication and very helpful with questions. The tabs them selves are also 5/5 me and my mates loved them, so yeah 5/5 on all fronts for TheEmperor setting a good standard indeed.

				Made another order today, was posted within 1 1/2 hours of placing order. <br /><br />Emperor messaged me saying my package might not arrive until thursday due to my postcode being out of the &quot;next day delivery&quot; network, but that doesn&#039;t bother me as I&#039;m in no rush to receive the package.<br /><br />Threw in some extras also<br /><br />5/5 all round - communication, packaging, prices.<br /><br />Goes out of his way to help his customers! More vendors need to be like TheEmperor!

				Gotta echo all the other reviews to date.<br /><br />The Emperor is bringing a new standard in customer service and product quality to the road.<br /><br />I truely believe that it isn&#039;t until things don&#039;t go perfect smoothly that you really see customer service shine. On my first order, the package that arrived didn&#039;t containt the right goods... however, a simple note to The Emporer and immediately the issue was well on it&#039;s way to resolution. (He even gave me a generous bonus for the inconvenience!)<br /><br />The second package arrived the very next day (even though I was out of next day delivery zone) and I was absolutely a happer camper!<br /><br />Communication is a standout with the Emperor, never left wondering what is going on.<br /><br />As for the product.... wow. 1200ug 25i... way better than doubling a 600ug that I got from another vendor.<br /><br />30 mins in and the body load is great. Euphoric, loved up, happy and spirtitually content. Visuals are phenomenal by about the 90 min mark, my tile floor was a bubbling morphing landscape. Find some good textured surface and get ready for full clarrity amazing visuals. The bonus is that you can still hold a great conversation and not be distracted by visuals unless you want them! Fast becoming my favourite high.<br /><br />Emperor - As I said in my review, you are a wonderful human and the service you provide is second to none.<br /><br />People - Add to cart now!<br /><br />

				Forgot to mention then good communication didn&#039;t end once the transaction did.. Emperor took the time to thank me for my feedback and gave me the opportunity to purchase at his outdated discounted rate...<br /><br />And I am now a repeat customer :)<br /><br />Much respect Emperor, keep up the great service!
