				Wow. Yes, I&#039;d click resolve to extend it and contact support, but also contact the vendor.<br /><br />Have you yet? If not, that&#039;s the FIRST place you should be going. Sending you cut could&#039;ve been a COMPLETE mistake. They look the same for a reason. A top 2% vendor will lkely fix that issue and make up for it plus some.

				Yes, but my messages have gone unread.<br />I reported him and asked for a full refund under &quot;resolve&quot; because I got a message from Customer Support saying that this order had been sitting un finalized for too long so I had the option to resolve.<br />If it severs my relationship with this one vendor, I&#039;m okay with that.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t ever trust to order from him again.<br />But I really don&#039;t want this one refund to affect my credibility with other legit vendors.<br />&nbsp; :-\

				Huh, damn. That&#039;s too bad. When was he or she last on? Maybe he or she hasn&#039;t had time to reply yet. It&#039;s very possible. <br /><br />Make sure to redact the name if this is fixed. But yeah, keep it there (and add it to the OP) so people know not to order from that vendor until this is fixed.

				Separately msg SR support explaining the situation and that you want to seek refund/ full compensation but that you do not feel it would be right for your refund rate to be affected given the situation.<br /><br />Also, the vendor might resend without SR having to get involved.<br /><br />Or at the worst you get a refund, shit refund stats and so you can just setup a new buyer account.<br /><br />Please update us with how the vendor responds, the future forum users can decide in the future whether they wish to order from him.<br /><br />Thanks

Or it is an error or the vendor is a complete idiot. S/he risks of compromising his/her reputation for nothing.<br />Go to resolution and report the vendor in case s/he doesn&#039;t reply to you and resolve the problem (but give him/her a chance first).<br /><br />Btw if you can try to have some proof around of the fact that the product is all cut. If the vendor really did this intentionally s/he probably relies on the fact that you are new and support will not believe what you say given his/her stats. So harm yourself appropriately. Also I would post this on the thread of the vendor to let others know (after you are sure it&#039;s a scam).

				I also got 3.5gr of very weak shit, nearly all cut from Chaletta.&nbsp; <br /><br />I made the mistake of finalizing and leaving a good review before taking the time to try enough of the product.<br /><br />Sadly, not the only vendor this has happened with for me.<br /><br />I completely understand wanting to build a reputation as a serious buyer.&nbsp; This has been my goal as well.&nbsp; What then can we do when confronted with this dilemma of being new to the Road, but not new to this product and knowing good stuff from complete garbage?<br /><br />See the newbie thread, &quot;I want my old meth back&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

It is very important you do so others in the same situation as yours can know of this.<br /><br />In all cases you can still report the vendor and explain the situation. Remember: these things are NOT accepted in the SR, so report all vendors that do. It doesn&#039;t matter if you are a newbie and the vendor a top one, you have all the rights to get the product you paid for and SR admins are very attentive on these things (actually the more popular the vendor the more they are severe, and rightly so).

				i&#039;m not sure but i think SR will give you a refund if your package doesnt arrive. i dont think you get refunds on quality. it would be way to time consuming as everyone and their grandma has a different opinion. i cant say for sure as i have never done a resolve before. i would try with the vendor first and see if they have any morals. maybe they will make things right. i&#039;m not sure SR will be able to give you a refund. if enough people are having this experience and they all report the vendor then SR could take away their vendor page.<br />sorry to hear this happened. keep updating on how it goes.

				Just giving you guys an update...<br />Vendor has still not read my messages.&nbsp; Shocker.<br />I have NOT finalized.<br />I reported him AND resolved rather than finalized and requested a 100% refund and explained the entire situation.<br />I still have the entire bag he sent me minus the small amount a tried to dilute in water (to shoot) and the small amount I loaded in a pipe.<br />To clarify:&nbsp; I have been a user for 15 years.&nbsp; I know dope.&nbsp; This is pure cut.&nbsp; Sparkly shake that doesn&#039;t smoke at all.&nbsp; It makes you cough.&nbsp; Really chemical fumes come off of it.&nbsp; And it doesn&#039;t break down in water.&nbsp; At all.&nbsp; It just stays in little flakes in the syringe.<br />It&#039;s totally NOT meth.&nbsp; Not even a little.

				yes, prime example of why you should never FE. atleast this gives you a chance of getting your money back. if you FE&#039;d this prick would be laughing his way to the bank. hopefully enough people will come forward giving SR reasonable assurance that this guy has been screwing people. iLoveTaffy is right, a ball is a lot of money. its not right whether its a ball or a dime bag tho. i understand with illegal drugs theres going to be fluctuations in quality. sometimes it might not be as good as the last time, next time might be the bomb but when its entirely bunk, you know it was probably on purpose.<br />this is why i&#039;m scared to buy off 1 person lol usually i order from 2 people at the same time. 1 order from my main guy and then a small side order from someone else. if i get 1 order thats bad, the next day im in w/d&#039;s and then next day i&#039;m screwed large lol the vendors you can depend on are really amazing. lets weed out the bad ones.

He did either reship the product for free even if he was not required to do so given you had already received a full refund, so I think at this point he doesn&#039;t deserve that people can read through part of this thread and possibly come to a false conclusion (in a perfect world people would read ALL the topic, but this is far from a perfect world). You have deleted the vendor&#039;s name but it can still be found a little later.<br /><br />I think the vendor has earned a little of good publicity in place of the initial bad one he got from the error; now that the error is no more so it should be the bad publicity.

				Blackiris is right, this is an awesome piece of reading for a new user, I&#039;ve never used the resolution center, but I&#039;m glad it works.

				Well, IMHO, you got a huge bunk deal and he wasn&#039;t responsive, right? So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a huge problem. If he WAS screwing people over, people had to know to make sure not to make purchases! It&#039;s only right. <br /><br />If he fixes the shit, edit his name out. Simple as that. There&#039;s a certain time limit that vendors should follow regarding PMs, especially one as important as, &quot;Hey, the meth I just bought from you is 100% cut, no meth whatsoever.&quot; Because that&#039;s BS.<br /><br /><br />Anyway though, how was the meth you got in return? Was it on par to what you were expecting? Was it a good enough high to make it worth this whole fiasco?

				What I don&#039;t quite understand is how the community feel it&#039;s acceptable for the vendor to have *possessed* cut in the first place... surely this indicates that he cuts his product?&nbsp; Granted, it&#039;s a fact of life that drugs are often cut all the way through the chain... but is it acceptable on SR for one of the site&#039;s vendor to be doing so?<br /><br />I guess if his advert is honest, there&#039;s no real comeback.. but I&#039;d have thought one of the (unwritten) goals of this community is to identify and marginalize vendors who cut their products?<br /><br />Perhaps I have it all wrong.

				Before I get into this, a friend of mine ordered significantly often from this vendor so that is THE ONLY reason I gave him a try (the 100 rating helped too). <br /><br />My struggle with Mr. Chaletla (copied from my feedback to him of 1/5 and with some explanatory additions with brackets):<br /><br />&quot;The whole story with my order:<br />Order marked in transit day after. I wait one week checking the mail, everyday after the 3rd day, and nothing. I start sending messages to track it. I get a reply that it&#039;s going to be sent tomorrow (that&#039;s 9 days after marked in transit! [10 days after the order is placed]). I gave the benefit of the doubt. Three days later I receive a bag of stuff that looks like ketamine tiny shards. THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER FINALIZE UPON RECEIPT. I smoked it and I guess if you&#039;re an idiot from a state like mine that doesn&#039;t know too much about tina maybe someone might&#039;ve thought &quot;that&#039;s what crystal must be like.&quot; So I reply that I better get the real stuff and I want it express for the utterly obnoxious wait time. [he replies he&#039;ll send me ten grams for the fuckup]. Two days later I receive a package of 60% big ass beautiful shards. Awesome product [turns out I was even fooled by the shards because the friend who recommended it smoked some and said it&#039;s not what he was sent two months ago]. The other 40% was that same crap from first time. But like a dummy I saw those gigantic beautiful shards and hit the finalize button. As a seller on the streets I figured I have a lot of people who just sniff so I&#039;ll give them that. Two of those people felt sick for two days. Personally after I accidentally mixed some with the big shards to smoke-test it, later in the day my hands, mouth, forehead, and forearms became pockmarked. I have no idea why this seller chose to fuck with me specifically given his amazing reviews and honestly a 5/5 level product [my friend says it&#039;s 2/5 compared to his old stuff]. However I seen forum postings about people with less than 5 transactions getting this fake shit. So if you have less than five be REAL WEARY of this guys shit. So, Chaletla, I hope all the people with low stats that buy from you and never tried tina or just not too good with understanding what REAL meth is wake the fuck up and don&#039;t fall for your &quot;meth.&quot; If you want me to make this a 5/5 review, (and your product was 5/5) then send real shit and not in a ratio of real to fake. JUST REAL&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m not upset about losing money at all. I am upset about losing potential money I could make selling this shit in an area that has a massive demand but the lowest supply imaginable. But if this is being done to &quot;newbies&quot; then that&#039;s a dickhead move like no other because these people are already nervous about how SR works and when I was using my 1st account (which I sold to a close friend because he needed an acct. with high stats to order bulk from another vendor), those first buys to me were exactly like Christmas morning. Had I been ripped off in my first few buys I would never have confidence in SR and would have missed all of these amazing opportunities in money-making, self-discovery through psychedelics I have no access to where I live&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp; Vendor got the message that I was one upset customer. He offered to resend the package, +weight, and express. The package arrived on time and was perhaps the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. GIGANTIC shards and beyond superb quality. My only advice to newbies or buyers with low stats is to message him before buying it and making sure that everything will be on point. Let him know you have heard about it happening to others and will not stand for it if it happens to you. <br /><br />Vendor told me that his packaging person was fired solely because of how I was treated as a customer. Chaletla takes customer satisfaction very seriously and I admire the tremendous effort he undertook to make my transaction satisfactory to me.

				No, I don&#039;t know what is actually was.&nbsp; Maybe that MSG stuff?&nbsp; It didn&#039;t smoke at all.&nbsp; Just melted and evaporated.&nbsp; It also didn&#039;t break down in water.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; So it was absolutely not dope.<br />It resembled shake.&nbsp; No shards at all, so it wasn&#039;t even convincing.

				Well he said he had to fire a packing person and he refunded my bitcoins. He said he was going to send a sample of the good but I have not received the &quot;sample&quot;. BTC is losing value so I cant even reorder with the BTC I have on SR right now because they are not worth what they were when I placed the order. I have not given him feedback yet, I am holding off on that to see what the &quot;sample&quot; is.

				This is surprising... I have been a long time customer with Mr.C and I got some fucked up shit that gave me a headache and actually caused me to puke.<br /><br />I think I have ordered around 15-20 grams from him since he started selling.<br />I tested the shake and it was great, so I finalized... had no reason to expect otherwise given my experience with him. <br /><br />I usually save the big shards for last, so when I got to the midsized ones. I started noticing something was a little off. More testing confirmed it, and resulted in being really sick and nauseated.<br /><br />But I&#039;m hoping this was a mistake as my experience with him has been nothing but stellar in the past....

				Nothing so far... I can confirm definite lingering headache today after a full two days rest though.<br />I&#039;ll take next steps as needed if I don&#039;t get a response. SR vision is focused on harm reduction and this shit should not be sold.
