				&nbsp;:( So I am unable to log into SR right now so i figured I might as well ask my question here. I just received my phentermine in the mail... upon opening them i noticed they didn&#039;t look right they had k 25 on them.. but they didnt look like any k 25&#039;s ive ever seen. <br /><br />They have darker blue specks. and the shape is off. I had been getting them from my doc up until about 3 months ago. I took one and they definitely don&#039;t have an effect. hell they don&#039;t even taste the same.&nbsp; Now, this vendor seems to have recent issues with fake pills being sent out, I&#039;m wondering if i should bother trying to resolve...or just finalize so I don&#039;t hurt my buyer rating. I just don&#039;t want others to think I&#039;m some con artist...hell ill send the dood the 29 pills back...I just want a real product<br /><br />please no flaming or anything kthx. just looking for opinions. <br />

				Don&#039;t finalise. Go to the resolution center and explain your situation and when you can post on the forums post in relevant thread or make one about it. Fake drugs aren&#039;t welcome here

				When you get back onto SR:<br />If you have plenty of time before autofinalize, message the vendor. Tell him/her and ask what they&#039;re willing to do for you.<br />I would hope they don&#039;t ask for the pills back as that would be a major issue with the vendor&#039;s security.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have much time, definitely go into resolution and at least ask for an extension and try to talk to the vendor.<br /><br />Who was the vendor if you are willing to share?

They are really doing a huge favor to some people. I haven&#039;t been able to get phen from my doc for a few months now due to being &#039;a normal weight&#039;&nbsp; But I still have a horrible horrible appetite. There is supposedly nothing else wrong with me that is causing this. Well having been a girl that used to weigh 300lbs and having lost pretty much all of that on my own...I developed a fear of being over weight. at 150 now I only want something to help me out...and the vendors that are offering the legit phen are doing me an unbelievable service. I&#039;d probably have eaten a pallet of chocolate covered pretzels, and a desk of cheez itz by now :D

				I just got a fake pill (OC 80) yesterday. I&#039;m still waiting to see what the vendor has to say before I put him on blast. He told me that half the people who bought them have complained about them. Maybe this is how my brain works but shouldn&#039;t that be a sign that your product is bad?

				I&#039;m hoping for a refund...the replacement will probably just be fake. Though I haven&#039;t finalized yet and I am waiting for a response back from him. He has said himself he doesn&#039;t handle the pills...even when I messaged him about the brand, all he said was &#039;Look at the picture, that should be an indication of the brand&#039; ....That should have been my indication to run far far away and not look back. sigh. I know not to get from him any more.&nbsp; <br /><br />How is a refund processed if you haven&#039;t finalized?<br />Have any of you dealt with peels4u?

				***update***<br /><br />I contacted the vendor yesterday night, I wrote him a long message on SR about the pills, and them being bunk and crumbly and not even bitter.&nbsp; Well he got back to me today with the same generic message as when I first purchased. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />*****hi whythehell<br /><br />your tracking number is (real- tracking -number-edited for personal-security) <br /><br />have a great day****<br /><br />now don&#039;t get me wrong, I appreciate a resend..but the likely hood of these pill being fake too is...well REALLY high up there. I&#039;m a little upset that he didn&#039;t even write me anything about the product, and that it was just so...generic. I&#039;ve got 13 days left before an autofinalize and i think 6 on a resolve. Now I definitely don&#039;t want to hurt my rating, and won&#039;t let it autofinalize. But what are my options if the 2nd sent pills are still fake, I know I could reslove. But what is the likelyhood that the response would be in my favor, since this is only my second purchase?&nbsp; <br /><br />I half feel I should just chalk it up to a loss and finalize since the guy tried. <br /><br />I&#039;ll re update again when the next batch gets here, I even took another of the pills originally sent this morning...still fake. I just really don&#039;t want anything to hurt my purchase stats and sellers thinking im some dishonest asshole. ._. I&#039;m just a regular asshole<br /><br /><br />*Note to self and other newbies, if it looks to good to&nbsp; be true, it probably is. Even with high seller ratings and positive review threads, look a little deeper, ask questions. If you feel the answer you get isn&#039;t enough, move on. I should have thought something was fishy when the phen was being offered at nearly clearance prices compared to other sellers. But the cheap ass in me went for it, also remember don&#039;t go all in on your first few buys or with new sellers. Test the waters. Nothing like crashing thru a frozen lake. Glad I didn&#039;t FE.

				Is the tracking # you got from him the same as your original package or a new one?<br />Did he reship you more without you telling him your address!?<br /><br />Also, just noticed: Don&#039;t chalk it up to a loss and finalize since the guy tried. If he sends you more bunk pills resolve, try to get a refund.<br />Or have him refund you out of escrow (in full, minus SR commission) and then finalize. That way it doesn&#039;t affect your stats.<br /><br />Feedback wise IMO if he sends more bunk and does refund (fully, out of escrow) I&#039;d give a 3. Resolution refund of full amount maybe a 2. Nothing good being returned/received a 1, obviously.<br />If the reship is good, maybe a 4 since he still screwed up in the first place, horribly.

I will do that, I really hope the pills aren&#039;t bunk this time. I just want my pills, I almost feel like having the other ones tested, just to see what EXACTLY is in them.

				If you really want to test them you can burn $120 and send them to ecstasydata. if you google you can find the address and they have submission info available freely.<br />You won&#039;t find out the amount (mg) of whatever is in it but you find out the active ingredient(s) if any and the ratios they are in.

				i did a bit of googling and roaming around that site, I def don&#039;t want to burn 120 over 70 bucks. but I did see a home test kit that would test for amphetamines, not how much, just if they are in there at all. Or if its methamphetamine. I almost see that being worth it for future orders, just for myself really. I didn&#039;t really research whether those test kits were shit or not.&nbsp; Though this throbbing headache is my indicator&nbsp; in and of itself.&nbsp; Hopefully I get the second package before I go onto work today. <br /><br />On a side note, wonder when sellers will start offering some verified doctors notes. I need some time off work. ^_^

				****UPDATE****<br /><br />I received my make up shipment of phentermine today. These are legit. I&#039;m quite happy with these pills. I wish I could have gotten them in the first place. I feel cimicon could be a great vendor if he works with his handlers and gets on top of his product. <br />5/5 ship time. <br />3.5/5 stealth (I ordered low numbers so hopefully his bulk shipments are a bit better in stealth. <br />4/5 speed of communication 3.5/5 informative communication <br />0/5 first product <br />Made good on issue<br />5/5 second product.<br /><br />Overall it wasn&#039;t the worst experience of my life, yeah I got shit pills the first time around, but I didn&#039;t FE. He sent out good stuff after I had contacted him about the bunk pills..I think I waited about a week over all for both. So, he worked with me and made sure I was a satisfied customer, and that is all I really can ask for other than send out good stuff the first time. <br /><br />I feel if he works out the kinks, he can be a good seller. Would I go back? maybe as a last resort. Though he would probably require FE, no thanks on that. No hard feelings and I wish him the best of luck in his business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for all those that offered advice to me regarding the situation.
