				So I live in a very small country and about the only bitcoin seller wants photo id.<br />They have had their accounts frozen and want over the counter payment.<br />Without naming the country, I want a very stealthy place and payment method to buy coins.<br />Maybe some can guess where I am.&nbsp; I am not sure if naming the country is cool?<br />Advice please?

				i would say your best bet is to go onto https://localbitcoins.com and see if you can trade someone for cash.&nbsp; Or if you are not really worried about linking up a bank account to transfer funds and then convert to bitcoins, you can use something like https://coinbase.com<br /><br />Either way you will be moving those bitcoins to your SR address.&nbsp; Once the SR transaction is completely (which can take a few hours), you will be able to change your SR bitcoin address as you already know how to do.&nbsp; I would say these would be the best ways to go about purchasing them.<br /><br />Best of luck to you.
