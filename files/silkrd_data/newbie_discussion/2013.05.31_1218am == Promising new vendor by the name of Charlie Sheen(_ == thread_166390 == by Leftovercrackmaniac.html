				Currently waiting for a 1/4 gram sample&nbsp; of fishscale coke. On top of posting a review to his thread(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=165471.0) upon receiving I plan to update this small thread with the review to get him out there more if he turns out to be a man of his word as well as carry a great product with great stealth. Can&#039;t wait to let you guys know how it goes(:

				he was kind enough to hook me up with a very nice amount of #4..&nbsp; &nbsp;seems like a real nice guy who knows his shit and has spent enough time as a buyer on SR to understand what we, as his customers, really want...<br /><br />and trust me, yall will know when it has landed and what the quality&#039;s like..&nbsp; his prices are very reasonable if it&#039;s good gear.&nbsp; fingers crossed!<br /><br />

				Oh I concur(: I can&#039;t wait to test the quality of his product and observe his stealth(:<br /><br />He certainly does seem to be quite the nice dude, I look forward to doing business with him for sure once he sets his vendor account up.<br /><br />Do let us know how his #4 is((: I&#039;ve never tried that stuff but I may give it a shot sometime and if he has great gear then I will certainly purchase #4 from him if the desire ever comes to try it lol

				No ETA :( But I was told by Mr. Sheen that he would send me a sample on the 28th.. So if if shipped on the 28th and it&#039;s domestic then it shouldn&#039;t be too much longer. I will keep you guys updated for sure(:
