				A customer of me asked me about it, and he got it from some bitcoin mining website<br /><br />so i decided to post here, to get an answer. <br /><br />The reason why I would like to know is, www.blockchain.info stopped with anonymous methods of RECEIVE and also SEND bitcoins.<br /><br />so I was thinking maybe bitcoin-land could be less safe in the future...&nbsp; So it could be that an alternative coin should be added.... <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Interesting idea, but personally I don&#039;t think BitCoin will become more or less &quot;safe&quot; than it is.

				I&#039;ve been using the new 5up3r-53Cr37 digital payment system Hevy-Coin, because I don&#039;t trust bitcoin anymore.&nbsp; Hevycoin (HVC) is better than LiteCoin because HVC is heavier.&nbsp; It weighs more, so it&#039;s obviously harder to rip off from people.

				@ Barney, you can still run to the bank now... coins could go even higher man... if you look at the curve.. there is no serious down yet...&nbsp; personally I bought more coins yesterday just because of that.

				It is what you heard; a rumour. <br /><br />SR is safe as it is, and I&#039;m sure DPR will keep using BTC until he feels they are no longer safe.

				Did anyone watch the Litecoin price last 2 weeks?&nbsp; it has already trippled !! I had just about 100$ litecoins, but they are now worth 330$!! <br /><br />Google trends shows a lot of interest in Litecoin also recently!

				Bitcoin to Litecoin is already easily possible and instant for example here: https://btc-e.com/<br /><br />and I am pretty sure there are more websites already.<br /><br />

				Hevycoin weighs more.&nbsp; Litecoin is another also-ran, like BMR is to SR.&nbsp; When was the last time you bought something from BMR?&nbsp; HVC made me 10 million dollars last year, tax free!&nbsp; I owe my own private island and my own Gulf G6 jet to hvc, because Hevycoin was a ten-banger for me.&nbsp; Invest in Hevycoin!<br /><br />Another thing I noticed, this entry says Litecoin is a pyramid scheme:<br /><br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Litecoin<br /><br />whereas you will hear no such thing about HVC.&nbsp; Seems like the decision is not hard to make at all; invest in hevycoin.

				Hollandma, you sound shady as fuck.&nbsp; Trying to sell your whatever currency and trying to sell illicit substances on this forum.<br /><br />In summary, I&#039;m putting all my funds into hevycoins.
