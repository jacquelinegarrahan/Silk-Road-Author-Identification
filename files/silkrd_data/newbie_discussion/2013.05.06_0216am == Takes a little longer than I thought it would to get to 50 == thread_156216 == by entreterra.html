				I mean, I haven&#039;t been trying THAT hard. But still, it seems like it&#039;s taking awhile. I guess because you have to enter the little &quot;prove you&#039;re not a computer&quot; code. Plus, the loading times for the forums take a little bit; like every time I click on something that takes me to a new page, it takes about 5-10 seconds to load. Does this happen for anyone else? Or do you all get clearnet speed?<br /><br />Also, I tend to write longer posts with only a few one letter/word (spam) posts.<br />AND some of my posts don&#039;t seem to be registering, it seems. Maybe not. Okay. I think I&#039;m on 28.

				yeah its the damn captcha. fortunately, theyll let you post shit like &quot;cvnsanc dsjv dnav&quot; and have it count as a post, so they dont have to be &quot;quality posts&quot; like some other forums require; you can spam.
