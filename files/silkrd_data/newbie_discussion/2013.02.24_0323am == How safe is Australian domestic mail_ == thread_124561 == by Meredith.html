				Recently a friend just got picked up by the AFP (australian federal police) for getting drugs mailed to his house from overseas (Netherlands). Because of this I&#039;ve been a little worried weather or not to buy some domestic drugs. Has anyone in Aus been picked up or had there mail taken while ordering stuff domestically?<br /><br />Also would be great help if anyone could tell me what type of punishment my friend is going to get they found about 100-200ML of GHB/GBL currently he is really worried if weather or not he is going to jail.<br /><br />Thanks.

				google is yout friend, see what shcedule drug ghb is in and how much he had. <br />Don&#039;t order from over seas unless you really want to, even then don&#039;t some on and complain about getting busted as if people did reaserch they would know that aus customs is amongst the best in the world.&#039;<br /><br />Go local

				you ordering LIQUID from NL!!! of course thats risky.. no need to go &#039;local only&#039; as long as you think about your product and how it will be packaged. its not rocket science, communicate with your vendor, ask questions, order small to begin with and be smart... 200ml of ghb/gbl is not an easy thing to get past customs -especially from nederlands! be smart n you should be fine to order from europe!!!

				I only ever order my stuff from domestic vendors -- I&#039;m happy to pay the extra money if it means I don&#039;t run the risk of Customs. I&#039;ve ordered ... 4 or 5 packages over the past month or so, and all of them have come through fine! Weed, speed, MDMA and caps (to put the last two into). I always opt for Express Postage, and get it sent to my home address with a slight variation to the spelling of my name. I&#039;ve also been told that using a previous tenants name (if known) is a great option too, however that was not available to me.<br /><br />Best of luck!

				o/s ordering to australia is risky but it is doable, just do your research....<br /><br />Domestic australian is pretty safe, i&#039;ve done about 10+ orders and they have all arrived.

				Cool story Meredith. TRying to scare people from buying overseas? <br /><br />WHy didnt your friend just deny the package was his? AFP cant prove that he ordered the package unless he said something or was being watched.

How the fuck did you come to that conclusion? Telling ppl to be careful is scaring them? You have some great logic there mate..<br />It&#039;s hard to deny a package when they knock down the door and run into your house...Ofc they can prove it if they have his PC....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for the answers.<br />
