				Hi :)<br /><br />Trying to get to 50 not spamming the forums.. and this question might be of interest for other users around here.<br /><br />A friend of mine have a few blotters she&#039;d like to store for a little while (few month, not that long) and would like to know what would be the best/safest way..<br /><br />Any tips?<br /><br />I&#039;d say that aluminum tinfoil - then plastic - then in a book would be a good way to go, but she did read bad things regarding tinfoil.. can it interact badly with Lucy? <br /><br />If the blotters are in a piece of paper, rather than in tinfoil, couldn&#039;t that absorb the lsd?<br /><br />Thanks :-)

				Yes, there was a big problem with spammers. Especially when the bitcoin was very high in value. Back then I think they had to delete posts one by one after they had banned the spammers account, now it seems like they can delete an account and all their posts which makes the removal of spammers much more efficient.

				I&#039;ve always stored it in tinfoil with clingfilm wrapped around the tinfoil. I then put it in 2 ziplock bags. Seems to work e.g. I can still trip to level 3 after a couple of months storage. But I&#039;m no expert with acid.

				I&#039;ve stored acid wrapped in tin foil, then placed in an airtight bag and kept in a safe in my cupboard for about a month or so, and it definitely had a kick when I used it! I&#039;ve always heard that aluminium tinfoil is good because it&#039;s non-reactive with LSD.

				And again a great answer from Thé Biscuit!!!<br /><br />I personally keep my L in a very tight wooden box (no light, no moisture). The L are put in little plastic zipbag and labeled... that way I&#039;ll still know what is what in 50 years or so...<br />I&#039;ve kept L blotters in this wooden box for almost 10 years or so and when I took them they were still as fresh as could be, no lose of potency...<br /><br />The tricks are: NO light, NO humidity/water/moisture, NO air, STEADY temperature (doesn&#039;t need to be in a freezer, but lower temperatures are preferable).

				The reason keeping weed in the freezer is a bad idea, is it will cause the majority of the trichs to freeze and fall of the bud.<br /><br />The reason its not a good idea (generally) to keep LSD tabs in freezer is to prevent degradation due to the constant temp swings from opening it and closing it all the time, possibly creating condensation in the L container/bag/what ever. <br /><br />Liquid LSD how ever, is best kept in the freezer. As that is the best way to keep the molecule suspended safely in the liquid, what ever it may be...Unless of coarse its some rare occurrence that your L is suspended in distilled water.&nbsp;

I&#039;ve tried a few of his techniques and do believe that the experience of the trip becomes more spiritual and &quot;cleaner&quot; after applying these techniques... <br />but that is probably not something that everyone will agree on nor be open-minded about... even if you&#039;ve &quot;enlightened&quot; yourself before by using L.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s really interesting. It makes sense though. Where did your friend store his/her tourmaline &amp; blotters? In a box? Were the blotters &#039;protected&#039; from air by anything? Was the meditation regularly or just before ingesting the LSD?<br /><br />That&#039;s somehow what worries me about aluminum foil. I mean rationally it sounds rather efficient, foil + plastic + book or freezer, (protects from light + air + temp) - but even if it doesn&#039;t chemically interacts badly with L it can as well interact in a more subtle way, and same goes for the plastic... Sending positive energy might help :)<br /><br />(Edit: Real tin foil might be better than aluminum foil though..)<br /><br />Direct storage in contact of paper would make sense for me, as from a couple of posts in this thread it seems that the paper won&#039;t necessarily absorb the LSD, it might be something interesting to try :)<br /><br />The wooden box sounds good too, and why not adding some crystals or whatever...<br /><br />Great thread, thanks again :)<br />

				Doooood that is fucking awesome, I really like the idea of adding/cleansing the energy of psychadelic drugs! Everytime I grow a batch of mushrooms I am going to bless them in the name of the mushroom gods and meditate&nbsp; on them. Might look into different gemstones and the types of energies they attract as I am sure there are many different thing that can be done. Oh yeah a good pure lookin quartz crystal is supposed to work good with flowing energy and stuff, or so I have heard

				I&#039;ve found put it in a couple of black ziplocks, airtight container of dry rice/preservation packs (not quite sure the name) and into the fridge works well.<br />Tested some of 3Janes white Alphas from mid last year, just as beautiful as when they went in.<br /><br />Not sure if it&#039;s worth putting them in the freezer.

				Great thread. <br /><br />So after reading through it, is the best way to go: <br /><br />1. Wrap tabs tightly in rice rolling paper (instead of foil)<br />2. Place in air-tight opaque ziplock baggy.<br />3. Place in freezer.<br /><br />&nbsp;???<br /><br /><br />

				A wodden box is good, yeah. <br /><br />I&#039;ve stored a few in foil, which was then put in a baggie, then put in a book, and they were just as good 1.5 months later. I don&#039;t know how long it would be before there&#039;s a a loss in potency though.

				Thanks flakesmith. I&#039;ll do that but may try wrapping the tabs in rice rolling paper to protect from moisture, then the foil - based on the comments on this thread.
