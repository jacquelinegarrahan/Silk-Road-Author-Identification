				If you have a drug case in the USA can your local drug task force or the DEA have your mail looked at more closely? Can they get USPS cooperation on that? Also if you pull a package out of a friends mail box cuz thats where u had it sent and lets say the cops alrdy where make a controlled delivery but let you go...why wud they let you go? And can they charge u later for taking that package out of your friends mailbox with them watching? If the package only contained one pill maybe they wud wana see where it wud take them and give it more time for more pills to come to create a bigger case?? Also if you have it mailed to yourself and it gets caught and u get setup can u deny it completely and say u had no knowledge of it coming or what was in the package? If they do this and watch u does that get them enuff PC to get a warrant and take your computer? AND last question, if they get your computer are u completely fucked?!?? Actually heres the best question of all, how many people have been caught out there or at least had some problems getting your packages and ether kno it was cuz of police or suspect that was the case...if you have gotten a package from SR seized or have been setup with it post and lmk what happened please!<br />Thanks,<br />GG

				Holy questions, Batman.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you&#039;re in the middle of a drug case and/or probation, I&#039;d give SR a break.
