				Sorry about that bad joke, I was still in spammin mode. Drug of choice? Gotta be MDMA. I have used weed, LSD, mushrooms, cocaine, speed and ecstacy pills for years when I was younger. All have their own pros and cons. For me, MDMA is the best way to minimise risks of adulterated substances and mental health problems. My mental health wasn&#039;t great to begin with, so some of those other drugs just mess me up too much.

				@Full_Escrow_UK - DMT, no, LSD and shrooms, yes. Psychedelics like that are a completely different experience to stimulants like cocaine or speed. I don&#039;t think you could really appreciate it without doing it. My limited understanding is that DMT is just like a zillion times weirder, but LSD and the like can be weirder than you can handle anyway. The first time we took it as teenagers, my friend thought I was the Devil and I was gonna sacrifice him. He was really freaked out. I was having a great time (&#039;til then) :)

				Mescaline and LSD are the main ones at the moment. Mescaline has always felt quite earthy and in tea/jelly forms one of nature&#039;s challenges to consume. <br /><br />I will smoke weed on the occasional basis but usually it gives me too much anxiety and a racing heart. If used with the right people and waxing lyrical about the nature of the universe or how fantastic peanut butter is, then it&#039;s a winner.

				.. dont you guys think this is totally stupid? I mean having to have 50 posts to be able to use the other boards.<br />Firstly I think 50 posts are way too much, like, its not about if you have anything important to say anymore or about the quality of your posts, it&#039;s now about if you&#039;re able to post 50 shitty one-sentence-posts in order to have writing access to the other boards. <br />Its just like in school.. its not about how intelligent you are, it&#039;s about how long you are able to sit still in a room with 30 idiots without going crazy and how social and motivated (=how good the financial situation of your family is and whether your parents are alcoholics/psychopaths or not, because this is what makes the difference between a motivated, happy child and a sad depressed child) you are.<br /><br />There are other ways to get rid of the spam and as the past has shown, sometimes even the 50-posts-requirement doesn&#039;t help.<br />Some people don&#039;t like chatting all that much and buttin in everywhere. I think this dumb rule impedes the communication too much.. People can&#039;t warn each other (nobody is gonna look at the newbie-section when they&#039;re trying to find out if a certain vendor is a scammer) and people can&#039;t freely share their experiences and knowledge, because before that can happen they&#039;re forced to spam around so they can be a full member of the community... Plus the ignorant idea of some people that users with a small post count are NOOBS and must of course also be new to the road and their statement is therefore not to be taken as seriously and is not as valid as the statement of somebody with a higher post count...<br />PLUS you can&#039;t really communicate in this section as threads get opened and pushed to site 2,3,4 ect so fast..<br />Anyway, that&#039;s just my opinion.<br />(Sorry for my English)

				Oh twelvemonkeys, I think nobody don&#039;t read suggestion from newbies too. But I think it&#039;s still better that way than no limits at all for new users.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind.<br /><br />Anyways. My favorite I think is MDMA. I take it only in summer and in the nature like twice in a year or something. I don&#039;t have much desire for drugs anymore. One interesting thing is that I don&#039;t like weed anymore after acid and DMT trips. DMT could be my second favorite by the way.

				@twelvemonkeys, I think it was a feature to both try and prevent prevalent scammers (hasnt really worked) and to make sure that the people that are contributing, are doing so productively. It&#039;s a hassle, yes, but in the end, you just post and get to 50...then the world is your oyster ;)<br /><br />favorite drugs:<br />weed<br />mdma<br />shrooms

				Although I&#039;m knocking on a bit...a scary 30-something.&nbsp; <br />Finding the SR has been a bit of a bonus, I had given up trying new drugs mid 2000&#039;s, spent most of the early 2000&#039;s fucked up.&nbsp; Now I&#039;ve had a rest, time to get some good MDMA (didn&#039;t think it was possible) &amp; try some new hallucinogens.<br /><br />Peace out

				I found out about it from browsing the web, read more about it spent several months researching, curiously. yet being cautious and too scared to try it. ONce I did I couldnt believe that this was for real. Its what Ive always been looking for, being a nerdy guy who enjoys E and other hard drrugs (or used to) I wasnt able to find it due to losing contact with old friends. My gf left me for being a meth addict, amongst other things I wasnt good enough to her, I see that now. BUT THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT was before we got together I talked up E and the whole scene so much that she got so excited, in the whole ~2 years we were together I never could find any shit nearly as good/strong/pure or clean as I used to get, it was disappointment after disappointment. when she broke up with me around new years I was CRUSHED. I figured what do I have to lose and I ordered from SR the first time. it was fast, secure, convenient. Ive never looked back.&nbsp; <br /><br />now my ex is hanging out with me again... were going to EDC together.. is it me, or the sweet shit I have now? Thanks again SR
