				actually thats a good idea... <br /><br />there are some more extentions to the idea..<br /><br />1. if you have a spokeo (or similar account) search for your address, then it will give you a big list of former residents...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;you can use any of those...<br />2. mail forwarding is usually there for 3-6 months 1 year tops, so older former residents will not get their mail forwarded. <br />3. in your free time choose 1 or more of the former residents name and your address, and mail junk in standard envelopes, <br />and keep mailing them once in a couple of months especially when you travel out of town...&nbsp; you can then verify that the mail reaches you all the time...&nbsp; also Mr NEWMAN will be used to delivering that name to the postbox. (but if it is real NEWMANN he may end up smoking your weed) <br /><br />never tried it but should be a good option...<br /><br />M8

				Yeah, that&#039;s a second question. What about delivery just to &quot;current resident&quot;, or &quot;[former resident] or current resident&quot;? Would that raise suspicion when it&#039;s a package rather than generic mass junk mail?

				If the postman is delivering a single package/envelope addressed to current resident it looks suspicious; your neighbors should be getting similar pieces as well.<br /><br />Above mentioned thread also pointed out if your order is not domestic, is an Australian address really going to get &quot;Current Resident&quot; mail from India?

				I doubt most vendors would even ship to &#039;current resident&#039;.<br /><br />I think some of the thought is an envelope addressed to current resident might be one thing, but a priority mail box would look really suspicious. Envelopes to current resident are usually mass/junk mail type windowed envelopes and it would also look funny to be the only envelope of that type getting delivered in the area, usually you would see at least a few of the same envelope on your route, or sometimes hundreds or thousands.

				I would say it&#039;s a bad idea for a few reasons.<br /><br />If your postman has had the route for a long time, he may know that the old resident doesn&#039;t live there anymore.&nbsp; He still has to deliver junkmail, so he wouldn&#039;t bother with it.&nbsp; A package on the other hand, good postmen would not deliver it to an address they know isn&#039;t correct, and may even get it sent to the former residents new address if they are still local.<br /><br />To be honest it&#039;s a dick move anyway.&nbsp; This is a real person&#039;s name you are putting on your illegal package.&nbsp; How would you feel getting a CD for something you didn&#039;t order?&nbsp;

				Ask the vendor do not take advice from people who write on a newbie forum. <br /><br />The advice on here is plain ol&#039; bad at times.&nbsp; Just because you don&#039;t sign for a package doesn&#039;t mean you can get any size package of any item and play dumb with the LE once they discover it arriving to your address.&nbsp; If you say &quot;see it&#039;s not me&quot; that is not going to work, trust me they will just slap more charges on your for acting like a bonehead.

				I was pondering a very similar question last night whilst on a ketamine binge.&nbsp; The two purchases I have made from SR I have used my correct name.&nbsp; I would worry that the postman would pull letter out, and if a dodgy name do something stupid like use his initative knowing that someone of that name doesnt appear to live there and open it being nosey.<br /><br />I appreciate in their busy working job its very unlikely but if you knew the name of a household residence and saw a small package in your bag with a diff surname would you be tempted to open it if didnt think it regular post.<br /><br />Or maybe I just think too much.....

				I have a rent house, and receive mail for about 5 different people on a regular basis.<br /><br />if the vendor is sending an envelope, then I would say go ahead!&nbsp; if its a package, I would be a little more cautious<br /><br />I used to have a deadbeat roommate, he lives in another state now but never changed his Addy w the post office so I use his name

				Here is one more idea...&nbsp; it takes a long time... this would work if your mailbox is one in a big apartment system... <br /><br />Pick up a Random name... eg here lets pick &quot;john doe&quot; <br /><br />pick out any address random address where there is no &quot;john doe&quot; <br />and start sending some junk mail to john doe to that address from anywhere in your town, send like 2 letters in 1 month for a month. <br />if you want write a love letter just for fun... <br /><br />Next go to a post office and get a address change form, and send in a address change for john doe from that address to your address...<br />next couple of&nbsp; months keep sending mails to the old address and then to the new address as well. Then stop sending mail to the old address<br />and keep sending ones to the new address. <br /><br />There you have then once you are sure you get all the mail you send, then just use that name and your address to order from SR....<br />what you could do is also order normal stuff in that name (just dont use your credit card for such purchases, or link you real name in <br />any way to that name). <br /><br />To convince the postman even further, what you could do is go visit some malls in your area, and fill in those promotional offers with that name and your address and you will get all junk mail also in that name. they have these things where they offer lotto on cars etc... <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Read up on the postal worker note in this forum. It was very insightful. After reading that, I would highly recommend not doing this. It sounds like that&#039;s almost a guarantee to get forwarded. Now that I think about it, after living in 4 houses, 3 of which had previous owners, I&#039;ve never seen a single piece of mail addressed to the previous owners.

				I thought the normal rule of thumb is to use your real information.&nbsp; As long as stealth shipping methods are used, isn&#039;t it highly unlikely for the Post Office to get suspicious?&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand if you&#039;re getting multiple packages from outside the country on a daily basis...but one or two a week?&nbsp; &nbsp;Mailman is too damn busy to be monitoring what people receive that &quot;could&quot; look &quot;suspicious.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, I think the rule of thumb is just to deny requesting the package if LE should somehow get involved...just deny, b/c anybody can send anybody a package, unsolicited.

Not your fault for picking up whatever mail that&#039;s in your mailbox and then, having discovered it&#039;s for someone else, keeping it for a little while so you can write &quot;not at this address&quot; on it and then deposit it in the nearest mailbox.<br /><br />As for forwards, our system also requires a postcard sent to both the to and from addresses when USPS forwarding starts, to detect someone fraudulently forwarding your mail to them. Right now, I&#039;m pretty sure at least a couple former residents do not have forwarding, because I&#039;m getting all sorts of mail for them, a couple times a week.
