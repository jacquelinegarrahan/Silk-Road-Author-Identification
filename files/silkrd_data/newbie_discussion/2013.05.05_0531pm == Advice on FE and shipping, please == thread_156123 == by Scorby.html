				Complete newbie here.<br /><br />Placed my first order, a small one, with MrCronk and it&#039;s &quot;in transit&quot;.&nbsp; Now I&#039;ve noticed he/they requires FE from all and I&#039;m a bit nervous about that (after reading the DPR message, the guide and this forum!)<br /><br />Can anyone tell me if I have to FE before the item is actually shipped, or is it in the post now?<br /><br />I&#039;ll be happy to use FE (with MrCronk) once I&#039;ve had this order.

				FE= Finalize early. Which means releasing (sending) your payment before you physically have the package.<br />F=Finalize. Simply releasing after you got your package.<br />It has been written 100 times to not to. I&#039;d stick to that but i don&#039;t know your circumstances.<br />In transit mean it&#039;s &quot;on the move&quot;. Although at which part of the move only the dealer knows.<br />Beyond escrow lie only tears and never-ending scams.

				I don&#039;t know why you bought from someone without knowing about their reputation to being with. Yes, everyone says constantly don&#039;t finalize early. True if you&#039;ve got a lot of money in escrow. But it mostly just seems to be an excuse for noobs not to do some basic research. Check out the rumor mill. Ask around. Buy small first then buy big. Use common sense. There are legitimate reasons to ask people to finalize early. For instance the never-ending stream of scammers trying to fuck over vendors.

				Never FE - there are plenty of vendors that don&#039;t require new buyers to FE.<br /><br />FE&#039;ing isn&#039;t worth the risk.

				I finalized early on my first purchase. It was a respected vendor (who&#039;s still in business, in fact) who had a policy for first-time customers, and those with &lt; 5 orders, IIRC. It was also a very good deal, and for a small amount (~$15).<br /><br />Still, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d recommend it to another new user. Even with highly-rated vendors, some will selectively scam you. Selective scamming is scamming a noob like yourself who no one will believe when they complain in the forums of a scam. The odds of this happening are slim, but there&#039;s almost always other vendors with comparable deals that won&#039;t require finalizing early.<br /><br />With no orders at all, vendors will be more skeptical than normal, so you might have to bite the bullet and finalize early, especially if you live in a sketchy country, and/or the product is exotic/rare. If this is the case, keep the purchases small (nothing you can&#039;t afford to lose), and trust your gut.<br /><br />Good luck!

Don&#039;t FE, except if you want to take the risk that your order never arrive. I may FE, but only for small quantity when the possible loss of money maybe worth the try, so the risk is somehow minimized. Actually I Finalized Early one time for a small dollar quantity and everything went fine.

				I&#039;ve FE&#039;d two out of four orders because of my newbie stats. I could&#039;ve gone with someone else, but that would have been more expensive. Success rate is about 1/2 so far, with number 2 still in transit (I hope).<br /><br />In general I do not recommend it.

				Fact is that all here say &quot;don&#039;t FE&quot;, but when you are new here there are not many vendors that will thrust you (I can understand it, in fact) and not all products have the luxury of the choice.<br /><br />I have myself a FE in transit; I actually wasn&#039;t requested to FE (even if the vendor usually does for newcomers) and I did it myself because I had problems with my line and at that moment I didn&#039;t know how much it would have taken to restore it and the least I wanted was to cause trouble to the vendor (as in the event of my problem taking so much time that the order would have to auto-finalize).<br /><br />I always think that if you treat people with respect they should have no reason to not do so with you. If then they don&#039;t, they will lose a future customer, and when you are a vendor is that so wise?

				Thanks for the replies, folks.<br /><br />This is a UK to UK shipment for $51.34.&nbsp; MrCronk seems reputable at 97, a vendor for a year with over 300 transactions.&nbsp; The feedback is almost all very positive or FE.&nbsp; There has been some bad feedback, obviously, including on the forums.&nbsp; Some of this may be malicious, of course, but even if it&#039;s all genuine he does send out a large number of orders, so I suppose some problems are to be expected.&nbsp; He does say he hasn&#039;t lost a single UK order, however.<br /><br />cerealbox, you&#039;re quite correct that I should have researched a bit more.&nbsp; Basically, I&#039;d spent a long evening doing a lot of (for me) new stuff: Tor, bitcoins, etc.&nbsp; SR was slow and patchy and I didn&#039;t know about the problems the site had been experiencing (this was Thursday night).&nbsp; It was late and I had work and I wanted to get an order in before I went to bed.&nbsp; I made a decision based on the feedback without reading the whole page properly.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of text on MrCronk&#039;s profile page and the FE thing was somewhat buried in it, although it is made clear in the terms and conditions at the very bottom.&nbsp; He requires ALL customers to FE because of bitcoin value fluctuations - no specific mention of newbies.&nbsp; If I&#039;m reading the page right, this rule came into existence between 26 October and 15 December last year.&nbsp; Looking through the feedback, a large number of customers say they have used FE because he is a trusted vendor.<br /><br />So, does anyone have any idea if it has actually shipped or if it is waiting for an FE from me?&nbsp; Apologies for ignorance and naivety!

				So if it&#039;s &quot;required&quot; I suppose I should take the risk and do it now my money&#039;s in escrow, right?<br /><br />I have to say that it really does seem to run smoothly for almost all customers and feedback is glowing.&nbsp; Just one more thing, am I right in thinking that poor feedback (except the score) can be left after an FE, that it can be edited later if need be?

				Yeah if he wants you to FE then the chances are your parcel is just waiting to be sent as soon as you Finalise.<br /><br />And yes you can go back and edit your feedback, so if nothing turns up and you truly believe he&#039;s had you over you can go back and give him a 1 and let the road know what you think of him!!

				It&#039;s arrived and it&#039;s great!&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br /><br />Something interesting - this has been impossibly fast, because yesterday was a public holiday in the UK and as far as I know the Royal Mail were doing no collections.&nbsp; Either: 1) I&#039;m wrong about that and the seller was able to use a sorting office to place goods into the system; 2) Despite the seller&#039;s rules they did ship before I&#039;d finalised; 3) It was collected and delivered on the same day (seems very unlikely from 1st class post - you have to pay a premium for that service).<br /><br />Either way it was a lovely surprise and I&#039;m a happy chappy!
