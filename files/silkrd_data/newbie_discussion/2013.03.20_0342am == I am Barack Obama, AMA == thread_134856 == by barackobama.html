				Great article about Obama playing the role of Satan in &quot;The Bible&quot;:<br /><br />&nbsp;A History Channel miniseries has caused controversy after viewers saw physical similarities between the actor playing Satan and the US president.<br />Our Coverage<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; St John the Austere considers the life of a boy called Jesus<br /><br />The controversy began after the History Channel aired the latest episode of the popular series on Sunday evening, with Morocco&#039;s Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni playing the part of the devil.<br /><br />Conservative commentator Glenn Beck said on Twitter, &quot;Anyone else think the Devil in #TheBible Sunday on History Channel looks exactly like That Guy?&quot;<br /><br />Other people on Twitter also said they saw a similarity and posted messages such as &quot;Satan looks like Obama – say what?!&quot; and &quot;whoever played Satan looks like Obama ... creepy.&quot;<br /><br />The History Channel said producers of the show, which takes viewers through the stories of the Bible&#039;s Old and New Testaments, had no intent to cast an actor who looks like Obama as Satan, and that any resemblance was coincidental.<br /><br />&quot;This is utter nonsense,&quot; Mark Burnett and Roma Downey, executive producers of The Bible, said in a statement.<br /><br />The actor who played Satan &quot;is a highly acclaimed Moroccan actor,&quot; the producers said. &quot;He has previously played parts in several biblical epics – including satanic characters long before Barack Obama was elected as our president.&quot;<br /><br />Burnett is the Britain-born producer of the reality series Survivor and his wife Downey is best known for playing an angel in the 1990s series Touched by an Angel.<br /><br />The History Channel said The Bible was produced with an &quot;international and diverse&quot; cast and that it was &quot;unfortunate that anyone made this false connection.&quot;<br /><br />A similar controversy broke out last year, when some viewers of the violent HBO drama series Game of Thrones noticed a prosthetic head on a stake shown in one episode bore a resemblance to former President George W Bush.<br /><br />The creators of Game of Thrones apologised and said they did not shoot the scene with that intention.<br /><br />On Sunday, The Bible was the most-watched show between 8pm and 10pm, with 10.8-million total viewers. Over 50-million viewers have seen at least part of the 10-part miniseries since it debuted on March 3. – Reuters<br />
