				So yeah, im gonna be taking LSD for the first time this summer and it will also be my first SR purchase. It will be with 4 or 5 mates at one of their houses. Im used to MD, Ket and weed but this will be my first psychedelic. <br /><br />I was planning on buying 10 of those Hoffman blotters from JoR and taking one each but im not sure if this is enough. What do you guys think? Should i get 10 weaker tabs and take two or go for some stronger ones.<br /><br />Also is it worth ordering from abroad (UK) or just sticking with domestic. <br /><br />If any vendors want to hook up a first timer with a deal and some good info that would be muchly appreciated! <br /><br />Thanks guys!

				I tried LSD for the first time last summer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already experienced shrooms so it&#039;s similar in it&#039;s effect but the actual experience varies from person to person.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always been told to be in the right state of mind; not depressed, sad, troubled, etc.&nbsp; The &quot;trip&quot; from shrooms or LSD has been an unforgettable one.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned alot of things about myself, the positive and the negative.<br /><br />Aside from the spiritual trip, it&#039;s really fun.&nbsp; Make sure you have some mind stimulating things to look at.&nbsp; A colorful poster, a lava lamp, etc. helps aid the visual.&nbsp; Some good music helps too.<br /><br />I took 2 tabs of medium strength LSD, took about 2 hours to hit me and lasted about 10 hours for me and was hazy while coming down for the last 2 hours.<br />I think it&#039;s about the same as taking 1.5-2.5grams of shrooms...at least in my experience.<br /><br />Enjoy your trip!&nbsp; Be prepared to act goofy! lol

				LSD is a great thing.&nbsp; Since it is your first time, I would take two of these per person which I have personally tried:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7a1fbe20b4<br /><br />Taking 1 would be safe, taking 3 would hit you hard, 2 is pretty nice but still intense.<br /><br />They are expensive and there is much cheaper out there, but very potent and pure, and a great vendor.<br /><br />If you are for it, I would also recommend adding some MDMA into the mix at the end or middle of your trip for a nice flip.<br /><br />I would take the L no later than 4 or 5pm because it will definitely keep you up for a while.&nbsp; If you have an ambien or a benzo to help you sleep at the end, that is nice too.&nbsp; All of these things are all over SR and super easy to get.<br /><br />The acid above I mentioned ships from Canada, but there is good stuff everywhere.&nbsp; It is probably the safest drug to mail because it is not scented for dog-sniffing, it is flat, and is mailed via basic standard letter...you can&#039;t go wrong.&nbsp; That vendor also offers some amazing MDMA if you are interested in that as well. He is super cool and will explain anything you need explaining :) His name is DReaMensioN<br /><br />Have a great trip!!!

				One tab should be enough for you guys whove never tripped before. Its gonna be fun though and good choice getting it from SR you might be getting something other than acid on the street.

				I&#039;m also going to be taking LSD for the first time this summer and so am also interested to hear others&#039; thoughts on this subject.&nbsp; Apologies if my post somewhat hijacks your thread.<br /><br />Like you, I&#039;m experienced with MDMA, ketamine and weed; but also coke, speed, G, &#039;drone.. I even tried shrooms in Amsterdam - no idea which but probably not very potent as I didn&#039;t notice any effect.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read a lot of acid &quot;trip reports&quot; so feel that I have a reasonable idea of what sorts of things may be in store.<br /><br />I have already bought 5 tabs from Symbiosis.&nbsp; Interested to hear what others think of his acid, as it seems to be reviewed very rarely on these forums?&nbsp; Like the OP asks, should I try just one of his tabs for my first time or dive straight in with more?<br /><br />Next week I&#039;m off to a music festival to which I&#039;ve been many times before and at which I feel very comfortable... I&#039;m aware of all the advice against experimenting with acid for the first time in such an environment, but given my experience with other drugs and familiarity/comfort with the festival itself, does anyone think that it would be a TERRIBLE idea?&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;ll try one at home beforehand, so I&#039;ll be better prepared when using in a field full of strangers.

				Hey&nbsp; hope you have a good one.&nbsp; I am going to re visit acid this summer for the first time in years (JoR hoffmans too)&nbsp; My past experience included some insane microdots and more gentle blotters.&nbsp; LSD is an amazing drug and despite the similarities not quite shrooms.<br /><br />I like the clarity of good acid it dont feel &quot;high&quot; as such just trippy if that makes any sense!!<br /><br />My hints are:<br /><br />Do it with your best mates<br />Have stuff to drink, but avoid alcohol<br />Do it during daylight and as has been said above start early, I have had my best times starting before noon!<br />go out into nature if you can, especially places where there are not too many people...just look at the beauty of it all.<br /><br />peace...i will be with you in spirit :-)

				oo good luck i still remember my first trip as one of the better days in my life. my friend and i took 2 each and it was really nice. i smoked a ton of pot all throughout the trip and my friend took a pill (cant remember what it was some PK) and we both had a great time. my favorite thing to do is be outside in the woods or on a boat. drinking water after a long bike ride is unbelievable whilst tripping. do it with a friend and respect your first trip and have fun

				Seconding the recommendation for going outside. My first time started out inside playing video games. Moving outside into the snow, building snowmen, having snowball fights and just running around was much more fun than the games. Find a local wooded park where you can sit and have some privacy. One the the best parts of my latest trip was sitting in the trees having a game of crazy eights.

				Hi FuzzyPhase.&nbsp; I HIGHLY recommend getting out and going to the woods or something.&nbsp; The way the trees wave and dance at you is breathtaking, and the patterning is like a shade being lifted from your eyes.&nbsp; Plus, it&#039;s good to just get away from people for your first experience.&nbsp; They can create a sense of paranoia. Always remember that if any feelings of paranoia rear their ugly face that they are all in your head.&nbsp; Psychedelics can create a strong snowball effect in the sense that you latch onto an idea, and then everything around you seemingly feeds into this idea (ie. on your walk in the woods you pass somebody that you think looks at you strange...you start to wonder if that person could tell that you&#039;re intoxicated...you convince yourself that the person knows your intoxicated...you start to think that maybe that person has somehow informed law enforcement or is law enforcement officer themselves...you fear that when you return to your car or home that somehow law enforcement will be there waiting for you.&nbsp; You get the idea.&nbsp; Mind control is of the utmost importance.)&nbsp; What&#039;s the dosage on the Hoffmans again?&nbsp; ~120ug or so?&nbsp; With Lucy, I find underdosing to be a big disappointment, and you may have to wait a week or so to redose to fully eliminate your tolerance.&nbsp; Likewise, you don&#039;t want to be so intoxicated that it frightens you or makes you feel like you&#039;ve lost all control. I recommend anywhere from ~250-350ug for a nice solid trip, so probably about 2-3 doses.&nbsp; 1 will leave you underwhelmed.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp; Love to hear the trip report.

				Have fun!<br />Day trips and nature trips are my favourite acid experiences, and they seem to work best if you can protect yourself from anything negative, threatening or scary. <br />I always try to &quot;prepare&quot; beforehand - as much as possible try to eliminate any risk of interaction with non-tripping people, or circumstances which might get out of control, etc. <br /><br />Timothy Leary (google him if you don&#039;t know who he is) used to say that LSD is best appreciated in an environment &quot;where Buddha would have felt comfortable&quot; and used to stress the importance of:<br /><br />&quot;Set&quot; - the place you take your trip, where you will be when it peaks and where you will come down<br /><br />&quot;Setting&quot; - the context or environment. Have a friendly, familiar atmosphere where you will feel safe and supported. <br /><br />And I forget what the third thing was. <br />But I suspect it had something to do with establishing a support procedure or a person to act as a guide if you start to have a bad trip. <br /><br />If you are gonna be in nature you will almost certainly have an amazing time. <br />It might be worthwhile having someone along who isn&#039;t tripping themselves, but who can help out if anything unexpected happens. <br /><br />Just contributing my two cents

				Seasoned Acid Vet here.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t matter how many you buy. Only, EVER start with one dose. It&#039;s a strange chemical, hard to get right. In the last 10 years I&#039;ve really only seen lucy around like 5 times out of a lot of hits. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve taken a lot of LSA, shit that broke down into ISO, etc. There are entire books that can be written just on how unstable the molecule itself is.<br /><br />Nevertheless, only start with one. If you&#039;re comfortable two hours in, maybe, MAYBE, take another. <br /><br />Once you&#039;re familiar with a vendor and can guesstimate the dosages you&#039;ll need in the strength they offer, you&#039;re all set.<br /><br />All that shit about bad trips...w/e. I&#039;ve had some screamers. Had a friend shot in the head and saw it on the local news while chewing on a 10 strip of sidestrip once. No bueno.<br /><br />It often turns out for the best. She&#039;s a strange girl, lucy. I love it when she&#039;s real with me. That&#039;s not so often the case anymore.

				I highly&nbsp; recommend reading this beforehand - http://www.luminist.org/archives/session.htm - although I do not suggest taking everything in there as gospel, I think it provides a useful framework for thinking about tripping and the ways in which you can turn your trip in an unpleasant direction. Also the effects graph is very useful. It definitely can&#039;t hurt to have read it and it is written in a kind of matter of fact, common-sensey tone that I think is quite reassuring as it grounds the reader. Lots of other material on psychedelics has a more spiritual/metaphysical bent, and while these things are interesting to think about and issues of this sort might be very real and important to you before/during/after tripping, it is also useful to be reminded of other things that might be very real and important to you before/during/after tripping like having a good time and not pissing off your companions and embarrassing yourself.<br /><br />Another thing you might want to think about is what you want to get out of the experience - do you want to connect with nature/meditate and explore your mind/listen to some of your favourite music/listen to some brand new music/hang out with your mates/watch films/watch bill hicks/shatter your ego? Different things may be more or less fun/possible on different doses so you should take that into account when planning your trip. You should also take into account the fact that you might find that what you had planned to do might not be as appealing once you are tripping and so, especially for your first few trips, it would be useful to have contingency options. So, for example, if you are tripping with friends it might be good to have a place where you can go to be on your own for a bit if the mood takes you that way, if you plan to listen to music (definitely a great idea) it would be useful to have a selection of things you can change to if something unnerves you, if you plan to trip indoors it would be useful to be able to go outside into a garden for some fresh air.<br /><br />Anyway, I would say the less control you have over the environment the lower you would want to do dose to begin with. So more people around = lower dose. But I would also say that there can be a disadvantage to dosing too low - the possibility that you will be in a nearly-there state which can lead to anxiety as you are waiting for something to happen and it never quite happens. I think really you have to take at least a full dose and dive into it, as you are kidding yourself if you think you can control the experience precisely by controlling the dosage. Not that that matters as you are always in control anyway&nbsp; ;) Eat as much as you can afford!<br />

				the second time i took lsd me and my gf went to the pub to play poker, was very strange. First hand i got dealt AA and the flop was AA something. Everyone at the table was looking at me thinking i was sick or something because i am tripping out trying not to look different holding four of a kind and going all in, everyone but one person goes all in too and of course i win but it was so hard to act normal with about 50 straight people in the room. and with a huge grin after i won the hand trying not to laugh.<br />After that i tried to lose my chips as fast as possible and got the fark out of there.<br /><br />another time about 5 of us were at my mates tripping and this old as dude walks in like real weird and goes outside to talk to my mate. the rest of us are going wtf who is that starting to get nervous. eventually he comes back in and leaves and the mate tells us its his friend and we were paranoid for nothing.<br /><br />best time was with my gf walking through a gardens up a hill, overlooking the area, didnt see anybody, all the flowers were bright as and moving around just walkijng around laughing at everything trying not to fall off cliffs.<br /><br />took a tab once and started drinking intending to go out to clubs with a group of people, then it kicked in hard and starting tripping balls and decided to go home bymyself. got home and straight into bed with the tv on. few hours go by hallucinating hard at the tv and realise its been informercials for an hour. think to myself i should play some xbox but never got around to getting up to turn it on.<br />need to go for a piss to try to stand up and fall over so crawl towards the door with it going sideways back and forth so squeeze through that and go into the toilet trying to piss into a moving bowl thats glowing birght orange. go back to bed forgetting to change the channel and end up watching informercials for hours then just staring at the wall watching the tv on the wall wtf, kinda like shadows but it was projecting onto the wall was a little scary for a bit but overal was fun.<br /><br />tldr: you just gotta test it out foryourself what situations to do it in

				Crazy to take more than one hit your first time IMHO. It&#039;s like nothing you&#039;ve ever tried before. Hard to explain but life changing for sure.<br /><br />My suggestions- take as early as possible, be somewhere comfortable and safe, outside is beuatiful but maybe not if there&#039;s too many people where you&#039;ll be, have someone with you that is experienced or not tripping if possible, have plenty of weed if you&#039;re a smoker and plenty of drinks...water, gatorade, etc. I always had plenty of beer and did not have any ill effect. <br /><br />Lastly, attitude and environment very important for a nice trip. Be happy, have fun and always remember...it will eventually end!

				No. It means I&#039;ve seen actual legit LSD-25 a few times in the last 10 years. Before that (70&#039;s, 80&#039;s, &amp;90&#039;s cats know), things were a LOT different. The Dead not touring anymore was one thing. The takedown of a few key chemists was another.<br /><br />I used to take some of the best acid on the planet on the regular, and I&#039;m damn sure I&#039;ve forgotten more about LSD than most people here will ever know.<br /><br />The stuff they call acid these days is usually a sad excuse. Either it&#039;s an analogue, or such a low dose/so diluted b/c of greed, that I&#039;m not even into it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it doesn&#039;t exist. I&#039;m just saying the real-deal-Holyfield is rare, and worth a few extra bucks.<br /><br />I remember a few years ago, round Hoffman&#039;s B-day in 06&#039;, some shit came over from Europe that was pretty astounding. I took ONE fat blotter that almost looked like a four way. 8 hours later I was watching a little mold turn into paisley rivers of day glow&nbsp; patterns spirlaling down my shower curtain. <br /><br />That&#039;s usually a pretty good indicator of legitness.<br /><br />Best of luck though OP. Hope you get lucky. Just be safe.

				&nbsp;::) Might want to add a link to your vendor profile in your sig Swanney.<br /><br />The key for your first time is not to sweat it - LSD is just a drug, and the main effects will wear off in 8-12 hours depending on how strong it is.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve already done shrooms, you should be OK, as LSD is quite a bit smoother of a ride.<br /><br />I would say MOST of the LSD being sold here is actually LSD.&nbsp; There are enough veterans around here that they will call them out if they&#039;re selling bunk.&nbsp; Most bunk around here is under-dosed tabs.<br /><br />First time, I would try and get some of those 180ug Mayas.&nbsp; One of those each will help you learn the majesty of LSD. 100ug is fun, but you only have one first time.<br /><br />Also, if one of your friends is difficult to deal with on nights out, leave him out of it.&nbsp; I hate going out with a group of people, when one of them happens to think it&#039;s ok to do stupid shit.&nbsp; No matter how drunk or stoned I am, I know how to act like a person.&nbsp; Those guys that drink six beer in 20 minutes, puke on the rug, grab some random titties and then try to fight with people should just be left at home.&nbsp; Those guys that are going to try to fuck with you when you are tripping (Ever have some try &quot;the box&quot; on you when tripping or just stoned? Annoying as hell).&nbsp; Basically dickhead people with big egos - they need to do 5 hits by themselves so you can wipe out that ego.

				Thanks for all the replies guys! Ive been on holiday so havent tripped or ordered anything yey and while ive been gone Jesus Of Rave closed his shop so now im stuck on what to order. I want 10 tabs suitable for a few first timers but the only domestic UK ones are a bit pricey. <br /><br />Im contemplating getting either the 150ug Flying Dutchman&#039;s or Jannis&#039; 130ug Dolphin ones. <br /><br />Flying Dutchman - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c2560fe600<br />Jannis - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c01ff9f686<br /><br /><br />These also look good albiet a bit weaker. <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1374cb03f1<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				I would stick with 1 or 2 if it&#039;s your first time. It can be an awesome experience if your with friends in a good environment. Simple things can keep you entertained for a long time. Try not to plan on any activities or anything to pass the time. The best trips are had completely unplanned and &quot;willy nilly&quot; for lack of a better term. Some of the funniest/weirdest/ironic experiences I&#039;ve ever had have been with LSD.<br /><br />Smaller dose = LOTS of laughs and a good first time<br /><br />Take a larger dose after you know what to expect from it.

				YOUR FIRST TRIP:<br /><br />LSD is fun and you feel like you have been introduced to a whole extra dimension of society and it deepens your appreciation of the world around you.<br /><br />When taking acid virgins through their first experience I always recommend;<br /><br />- Be in a safe familiar place with people you love and have positive feelings towards<br /><br />- Don&#039;t let your brain think anything negative. I have tripped 50+ times and have never had a bad experience. I have taught my brain that acid land is a place where only positive energy is allowed, and if my brain attempts to think something negative I say &#039;Acid land is a happy place&#039; and think about something else.<br /><br />- LSD is like a magnifying glass for your brain. Don&#039;t take it if you are feeling down or super worried about something as it will just magnify those feelings.<br /><br />- First trip: Take it on a sunny day in the morning or around lunch time, spend time in nature; whether it be in your backyard or a local park, and savior the experience. No trip will ever be as special as your first trip and it is a magical experience.<br /><br />- ENJOY :)

				i&#039; ve been on acid 3-4 times, smaller than the regular dosage (like half a tab of unknown ug&#039;s)<br />so far i haven&#039; t experienced a real trip, no great visuals apart from an occasional blurring of my sight and things looking more &quot;wavy&quot;. but it was pretty cool, i felt very energetic, and it also induced an extraordinary appetite for weed.<br />so i&#039;d say take like half a tab if you have the option and see how that goes

				I used to do lots of acid. When I say lots of acid, I mean I ate it like candy.&nbsp; Five hits would be average for me, and aside from driving or operating heavy machinery or rock climbing, there isn&#039;t a whole lot that I would not or could not do, and do well.<br /><br />But that&#039;s me.<br /><br />As a first timer, my best advice to you would be just to make sure that you are with a small group of trusted friends. Just one really good friend is even better.&nbsp; No outsiders or people you don&#039;t know well, and no unstable types. If you have a friend that&#039;s reckless and does stupid shit, that is not the type of friend you want to have around because he will be prone to doing even dumber (and sometimes just plain weird and disturbing) shit than normal when he&#039;s tripping. Only trip with well grounded individuals, and only trip in an environment that you feel safe in.<br /><br />Make sure that you don&#039;t have some issue on your mind, or that you don&#039;t suffer from any kind of complex when you drop. If you do, you&#039;re gonna have a bad time. Sometimes, when you drop acid even in the best of situations, your mind will go somewhere unpleasant. There&#039;s a reason for that. I found for myself that LSD beats the hell out of talking to a therapist. I&#039;ve seen others though that can&#039;t handle it. LSD is not for everybody. If that happens, just know that the drug will wear off and you will be fine. You are not going to die from it, and your mind will not be eternally fucked from one hit of acid. ;) On that note, one hit is all you need to be doing if you&#039;ve never had it. Wade in, don&#039;t jump straight into the deep end with LSD.&nbsp; There&#039;s always room to add down the road once you&#039;ve gotten the feel for it.<br />&nbsp;<br />STAY AWAY FROM LARGE CROWDS until you have experience. After I got used to tripping, I enjoyed crowds. If you&#039;ve never had acid before, chances are that a crowd is going to make you anxious and paranoid. You don&#039;t want that, especially on LSD.<br /><br />That&#039;s about it. Just research. Set and Setting....that&#039;s the key to having a good time, but there are NEVER any guarantees with LSD. You drop your hit and then you&#039;re on the ride and there&#039;s no getting off of it. Having a valium around might not be a bad idea, but I&#039;ve never needed it.<br /><br />I&#039;m editing to make one more point. A lot of people will tell you to have a &quot;sitter.&quot; That is someone who is not taking LSD to sit around and watch you to make sure you don&#039;t do anything stupid. I don&#039;t like the whole sitter concept. Unless there&#039;s something wrong with you in the first place, LSD is not going to make you dangerous.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Also the effects graph is very useful. It definitely can&#039;t hurt to have read it and it is written in a kind of matter of fact, common-sensey tone that I think is quite reassuring as it grounds the reader. Lots of other material on psychedelics has a more spiritual/metaphysical bent, and while these things are interesting to think about and issues of this sort might be very real and important to you before/during/after tripping, it is also useful to be reminded of other things that might be very real and important to you before/during/after tripping like having a good time and not pissing off your companions and embarrassing yourself.<br /><br />Another thing you might want to think about is what you want to get out of the experience - do you want to connect with nature/meditate and explore your mind/listen to some of your favourite music/listen to some brand new music/hang out with your mates/watch films/watch bill hicks/shatter your ego? Different things may be more or less fun/possible on different doses so you should take that into account when planning your trip. You should also take into account the fact that you might find that what you had planned to do might not be as appealing once you are tripping and so, especially for your first few trips, it would be useful to have contingency options. So, for example, if you are tripping with friends it might be good to have a place where you can go to be on your own for a bit if the mood takes you that way, if you plan to listen to music (definitely a great idea) it would be useful to have a selection of things you can change to if something unnerves you, if you plan to trip indoors it would be useful to be able to go outside into a garden for some fresh air.<br /><br />Anyway, I would say the less control you have over the environment the lower you would want to do dose to begin with. So more people around = lower dose. But I would also say that there can be a disadvantage to dosing too low - the possibility that you will be in a nearly-there state which can lead to anxiety as you are waiting for something to happen and it never quite happens. I think really you have to take at least a full dose and dive into it, as you are kidding yourself if you think you can control the experience precisely by controlling the dosage. Not that that matters as you are always in control anyway&nbsp; ;) Eat as much as you can afford!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />thanks for posting that link.. i just read it and i feel like im ready to take on some problems that might come up<br /><br />great link!!
