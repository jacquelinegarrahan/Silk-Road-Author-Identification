				I am expecting a few packages to be received by buyers. Or at least for them to release escrow. It is understandable why many vendors ask to finalize early.

				Yup. Just some benzos. Not excited really since I&#039;m not out yet, just running low. Little nervous because it&#039;s the first from this vendor.

				Hi fellow SR&#039;iance ;D<br />Ohh man, im a total newbie here and my first order has been place with HalfBaked on Tuesday last week which was 26&#039;th of March. In his description he says next day dispatch. Still havent received it. But ok, let me be unlucky because of the Easter shiat.. <br /><br />Interesting though - he has not been online for the past 3 days and suddenly - all of his listings have gone just today.. while SR says he hasnt been online? I am either following the standard newbie trade and thinking too much or he has done the runner.. <br />Also when i click to go to his page - the fan base has been removed and no option to become a fan......<br />In my order description i have &quot;shipped&quot; as &quot;processing&quot; still till today.. Though the &quot;cancel&quot; button has become available just today as well.. Should I definitely CANCEL?<br />Damn.. apparently he was good for quite some time.<br /><br />Anyone can pat me on a shoulder here? Is this (sometimes) normal for Vendors? =(( Should I cancel or wait till the end of Easter break the piece of shit? hahaha<br /><br />Thank you before hand &lt;3

				How does easter zombie day effect shipping? If yours still shows that it hasn&#039;t shipped then you can cancel it.<br /><br />Message the seller and let them know that if you don&#039;t hear back within 12 hours you are going to cancel your order and go elsewhere. Then follow through.<br /><br />It really should not be hard on either the buying end or the selling. Problem is that people have listings that sit for a long time and then they go on vacation or other real life things come up leaving you waiting. But really there should be no hard feelings if you cancel after waiting five days and no response.

				Hey everyone! Have been on SR for about 3 months now with 9 successful transactions.. so far every single one has been stellar! Read lots and order with confidence from trusted sellers and you should be fine.&nbsp; Products have ranged from mdma, christina, 25i, and m1.&nbsp; Have recently placed my first bulk order from china so fingers crossed (but am confident it will go through as it has for many others :-) )
