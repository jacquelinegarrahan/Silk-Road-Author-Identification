				I was wondering what the main difference is in effects. I know adderall is a combo of amphetamine salts 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, but I was wondering if I measured out certain amounts of Amphetamine sulphate powder(Speed powder) and placed it in capsules would the effects be similar? It seems to me that if you get a gram of high purity Amphetamine sulphate powder for the price of one or two generic 30mg Adderall why wouldn&#039;t you. I&#039;m looking for a good reasonably priced study aid/stimulant for school and those extremely long work days. So I decided to order my first batch of high purity 80+ Speed(Amphetamin Sulphate) powder. Your honest opinion on the two is much appreciated.

				i would be careful dosages are small, over dosing is a safety concern, plus so would abuse imo.&nbsp; having it already snortable eventually id say why swallow it if i get more of an effect snorting it.&nbsp; just my opinion. i couldnt tell u the difference chemical wise.&nbsp; also law wise adderall isnt that hard to get a script for, powder not so much lol

				i am EXTREMELY interested in this topic. i use amphetamine regularly by means of Adderall XR or IR depending on purpose i use small doses and don&#039;t use for high. i been researching over past months and the important things are potency, bio availability. and with amphetamines their is L and D. dopamine is more &quot;happy&quot; but i am defineitly in this thread to discuss and share knowledge

				My doctor who prescribed me my adderall script closed his practice and I don&#039;t feel like spending the time and money doctor shopping for a new prescription. Plus my ADD is a preexisting condition on my insurance so I have to pay full price for my adderall anyway. As far as the legal issue I am a clean cut white guy(not to be a bigot in any way) and have no drug charges on my record so the chances of me or my vehicle being searched are slim to none. Plus all my friends can never tell I&#039;m on drugs unless I tell them what I&#039;m on. I kind of prefer taking them in capsule form so I can properly measure the dose, it also feels like it lasts longer, and I could always open the capsule and snort the powder if I feel like it. Thanks for your input though. I would really like to here from anybody who has done them both to compare the differences.
