				C&amp;H Review for Vendor: Nod<br /><br />H 5/5- Absolutely as good as BT gets; dissolves completely in water without heat, pungent vinegar aroma, no mysterious &#039;floaters&quot; in the spoon, great solid warm rush upon IV, and the buzz has legs. <br /><br />C 5/5- All solid pieces consisting of beautiful pearl scales. Once the packaging was opened, I could smell that this was the real deal. Snorting a bump gives one an instant high with that long-lost numb-face that connoisseurs will recall from the days of C&#039;s heyday. I have been using C since 1986, and during the 90s my upstream connection bought by the key so I know the diff between &quot;off the brick&quot; and &quot;re-rock&quot;, as well as the pollutants and additives that corrupted the C over the past few decades . This is excellent gear. <br /><br />Packaging 5/5- Solid and stealthy packaging that uses double packaging and wrapping throughout such that even an abused package won&#039;t cause a breach. Nothing on the exterior that would cause any suspicion. I have placed two orders on Thursday evening, and received both Saturday morning (using express).<br /><br />Customer Service 5/5- Responsive honest polite. Definitely worth doing biz with again!<br />

				Originally I was going to purchase from NOD, but then I found dragoncove&#039;s page and he sells it by the gram at a significantly lower price. <br /><br />Has anybody tried both? My speculation is that they are close to the same quality but NOD&#039;s prices seem real high. Both have really good reviews on their page.

				I really hope some more people post on NOD&#039;s quality and service. I&#039;ve been eying him but I&#039;ve had such shitty experience with coke vendors (IE: SkippyJif - omg what a waste of air) that I&#039;m afraid to try him out. <br /><br />
