				Instead of writing throwaway post to get to 50, why not open your mind, and wax poetic. It doesn&#039;t have to be good, it&#039;s just funner than writing crap.<br />I&#039;ll start.<br /><br />&quot;CUNT! My chips...&quot;<br />Steve was really smashed.<br />Tom wasn&#039;t,<br />He was enjoying the molly I had washed.<br />My hands were hot,<br />On account of the gravy.<br />I texted home,<br />I don&#039;t think I could drive...

				And the poem I like the most gets karma (+1) once I&#039;m at 100 posts.<br />This is my last poem, as I&#039;m on post 49 now:<br /><br />&quot;Please Mr. Murdoch, have mercy.&quot;<br />Rupert was not pleased with the backbench MP.<br />The magnate&#039;s brow glistened with sweat,<br />His victim kneeling before him.<br />&quot;Policy... Is my decision, boy!&quot;<br />The man from the department of immigration nodded apologetically,<br />His aide standing motionless in the corner of the room.<br /><br />Rupert gasped, as he hauled his considerable weight into a chair.<br />After regaining his breath, the captives were released.<br />The prime minister stood behind Mr. Murdoch, looking uneasy.<br />&quot;Fuck off David. Ask for more wine to be sent in as you leave.&quot;<br />Cameron left swiftly, avoiding Murdoch&#039;s gaze<br /><br />&quot;You can continue now, Sugar&quot;<br />The high class prostitute returned to her knees.<br />Rupert&#039;s brow began to sweat more heavily now.

				In ten thousand years <br />I did what I thought that in seven<br />I could&#039;ve done more<br /><br />and whatever side I lay my head <br />Keeps me on or off the floor. <br /><br />A moment&#039;s time is longer<br />than a life before one&#039;s eyes<br /><br />and whatever side I&#039;m looking at<br />Is reassurance i&#039;m alive. <br />
