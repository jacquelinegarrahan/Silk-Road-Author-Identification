				If I&#039;m not mistaken I think one reason why for the incredible rise in cost for btc is because of shady BTC dealers who constantly seek to raise the price for bitcoins and purchases through them. I myself have encountered one such dealer already and was ripped off nearly half of the btc I paid for!!&nbsp; so there may be a bit of competing amongst bitcoin dealers here.&nbsp; the more one raises the prices for btc by usd the higher the costs sore.&nbsp; ultimately the rip offs will defeat themselves. and their profits will vanish.&nbsp; &nbsp;one thing the btc market needs is like a gold/silver backed standard medium which can set a&nbsp; stabilizing rate at which prices aren&#039;t allowed to raise higher.&nbsp; someone in the btc financial sector will I believe come up with a way to do this and insure some stability and fairness.&nbsp; &nbsp;your input about causes and solutions welcome.&nbsp; 8)

				You&#039;re putting too much faith in the power of a few to change entire trends. The cause for the rise in BTC is (likely) due to the rise in popularity of SR. If there&#039;s more demand for BTC then one of two things has to happen, either BTC will rise in value or more BTC need to enter circulation. Since the latter is relatively fixed, the result is that BTC raises in value. That&#039;s just how the market works, nobody is out to get you by inflating the prices - it&#039;s just what people are willing to pay. If you want to minimize your exposure to the fluctuations in BTC value, use your BTC as soon as possible after buying them. For my method of acquiring BTC, I can spend my BTC within 12 hours of buying them.<br /><br />BTC will likely continue to rise in value until something comes along to disrupt the growth in popularity of SR.

				SR really does play a major rule on the Bitcoin value raise, yet we can&#039;t forget about the speculators that been making use of Bitcoin with the recent big valorization

				I believe you&#039;re very mistaken.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s entirely possible that SR accounts for up to half of the Bitcoin ecosystem, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s at all possible that it accounts for anything more than that.&nbsp; I also think it&#039;s much less than that, myself, but without objective data to point to that&#039;s hard to back up.<br /><br />Let&#039;s look at a few numbers.&nbsp; Today&#039;s trading on MtGox, the largest (but still only one) Bitcoin exchange is 50k.&nbsp; That&#039;s 50,000 bitcoins that have been bought or sold on MtGox alone today.&nbsp; At $45 per BTC, that&#039;s 2,250,000.00 USD that has passed hands on MtGox alone.<br /><br />I seriously doubt more than 100k, or maybe, MAYBE even a million, worth of USD has been bought today on SR.&nbsp; Bitcoin is -- somewhat surprisingly -- becoming a very real, solid form of currency.&nbsp; SR effects it, sure.&nbsp; But not nearly as much as you may think, IMHO.<br />

And stop buying from shady dealers. Bitcoins are legal. Purchase them from legitimate sellers.

				It certainly isn&#039;t SR that totally drives the price.&nbsp; If silk road were to go down, however, I&#039;d bet there&#039;d be a more than minor drop in BTC value...
