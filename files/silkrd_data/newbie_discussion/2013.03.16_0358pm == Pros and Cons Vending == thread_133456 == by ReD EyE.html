				A few minor Cons<br /><br />#1 - Losers<br />buyer: i want a FREE sample so I can never re-order or write a review for you. Be sure to make it really big and no I won&#039;t pay for shipping. If you don&#039;t send me more FREE I will write a bad review about you.<br />buyer: hey i need that FREE sample!<br />buyer: thanks for free sample man! *writes no review*<br />buyer: hey i need another FREE sample for my girl she wants to try your stuff<br />buyer: you fucking asshole you only send 2grams this time fuck off you twat! *cries on forum how mean buyer is*<br />buyer: PAY FOR SHIPPING ON FREE SAMPLE ARE YOU INSANE! I WANT IT 100% FREE BECAUSE MY REVIEW SKILLS ARE SO BOSS. <br />buyer: I never got the FREE sample!!!!!!! Send another ASAP!<br /><br />#2 other vendor posing as customer<br />buyer : Hi I want to order from you. Send me a FREE sample bitch er uh ..great new vendor. When I send out produ... opps I mean I&#039;m new to SR and just want to be a loyal customer of yours.<br />Seller: Ok I guess I&#039;ll eat all the costs and trust you. Here is two grams of my best.<br />buyer to his vendor account/pals: ok I&#039;m going to sink this new fkr now with a bad review. then I&#039;ll write up our vendor account saying we are outstanding. Notice any other new vendors to fk over. yum he shit is really good, lets buy a bunch and resale it after we beat him down some more in the forum and he lowers price.<br />buyer: Sorry man you shit is really bad. I will make you an offer for all of it just because i like you. how about all 4lbs for $1500? <br /><br />#3 limp wrist<br />buyer: afdfdfdfdsaoioi xxxxxx<br />Seller: hi thanks for the purchase! I really appreciate your business and ask me anything you have questions with. This will go in the mail today as soon as I decrypt your PGP message!<br />Seller: I&#039;m unable to decrypt the address you provided <br />Seller: I want to make sure you get this so please send again<br />Seller: Hello please contact me<br />buyer: pvtnote xxxxxxxxxx<br />Seller: Hi sorry I don&#039;t accept pvtnote addresses. Please use PGP again and if you need any help I will supply information and links on correct way to use it<br />Seller: Hi, it&#039;s been 3 days and I&#039;m worried about your order. Please let me know how I can help you.<br />Seller: Hi can I help you? here is link on how to set up and use PGP ***clearnet** dlfkjadlkfjlakdjfaldkjflkdjflajdlakd<br />Seller: Good morning! Just checking in<br />buyer: President Obama 12456 Hollywood, CA USA<br />Seller: Hi, sorry I won&#039;t send package to that name. Also it is not wise to not encrypt address. I&#039;m cancelling your order now and please let me know if I can help you figure out the correct way to purchase on SR. I&#039;m sorry this hasn&#039;t worked out.<br />buyer: fuck you! i&#039;m going on the forum to tell them you are a SCAMMER <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P :P

				Best advice, dont send free samples.<br />Make it clear on vendor page you only accet pgp and not orders with prvtnote or other, plus silly names and addresses will be cancelled
