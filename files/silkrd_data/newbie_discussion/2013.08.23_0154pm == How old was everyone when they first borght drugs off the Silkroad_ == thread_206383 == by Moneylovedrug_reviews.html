				lol i consider tea and coffee sugar as mild drugs so i would say before i was 10. i moved on to other experiments when i got more knowledge and the universe guided m mind and choices by presenting opportunities. when i smoked my first joint i thought nothing of it just like another thing to smoke i hated cigs and never drank. my smoking weed was my own science experiment of curiosity i never died so obviously things came my way in their good time and i had other things that i could and did try happy person indeed to see the world in a wonderful perspective.
