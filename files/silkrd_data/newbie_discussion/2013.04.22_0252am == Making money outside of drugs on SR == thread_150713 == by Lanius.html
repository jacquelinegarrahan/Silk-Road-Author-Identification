				I&#039;m curious to know what ways there are to make money on SR whether it&#039;s by selling on it or by buying from SR and selling somewhere else outside of drugs. Would anyone be kind enough to share?

				Both is doable. I believe some will prefer not using same account to buy something from vendors and use it also to sell to buyer. <br /><br />For dealing or selling what you had bought on SR on the street around I think it will be much safer if you just spread anonymous flyers with your vendor&#039;s link on it, and let them come.<br /><br />Avoid people know you and get busted kikiki

				Really depends on what you can afford. Personally if you live in say Kansas where Marijuana is scarce [i know of many colleges where grams go for upwards of 40-50!] then buying a pound for 3000-3500 would give you a hefty profit. Personally ive been thinking of selling small amounts of bud on SR and just keeping coins as a side bank and cash out when the market is high. No use of continuously transfering btc to cash unless funds are limited. If you want to sell on SR you better have A. Great product B. Great customers and C. Time. The competition here is immense, gotta weed out the scammers, and under par quality bud, no pun intended.

				Thanks for your answers but perhaps I wasn&#039;t clear. I was asking about ways that did not involve drugs. Sorry for the misunderstanding.&nbsp; ;D

Let&#039;s say you want to sell stamps. Seems legal right? Wrong. The USPS police will find some loophole in their laws to go after you. Guaranteed.

Then you&#039;ve got to pull the coins out and into cash, which isn&#039;t that hard, but it isn&#039;t that cheap either. Expect another 10-15% on the way out. And that assumes little volatility in the BTC market. If you don&#039;t get out in time you could have worked for free.<br /><br />Still though, if you find a niche market and use stealth tactics just as a drug vendor would you could make money.

				it&#039;s all gonna be illegal.&nbsp; but you could sell fake ray bans or something.&nbsp; Where I&#039;m from there&#039;s never enough xanax, so I buy that in bulk.&nbsp; No money to be made on opiates really on this site.&nbsp; You could always get a real job.

				If you have e-books of interest you can sell that for a bit of coin. I&#039;ve been thinking about that. I don&#039;t want to be vending though cause I&#039;m new and would rather be a buyer but if you&#039;re interested I can give you some books you can sell. I got books on pretty much any subject. Even some books that I felt, while downloading could get me in serious trouble when caught. For example I have a LARGE folder which contains EVERY U.S. military and special forces training manual. From manuals to jets, to guns, to terrets, to being a army doctor ANYTHING you could think of. Other than that I have basically any book from Maths, to Science, to Philosophy, to Psychology, to Accounting, to Weed growing, to running a clandestine lab, to meth manufacturing, to homemade C4 manufacturing anything one could think of<br /><br />Stuff like that can be worth something to some people<br /><br />Let me know if you&#039;d be interested to sell books. I&#039;d be more than happy to provide some and enter into a partnership (I hate transferring BTC from cash)<br /><br />Regards,

I&#039;ve seen t-shirts and plastic baggies, too (I doubt the bags themselves are illegal). SR is practically designed for illegal trade, so I doubt many people would bother selling legal stuff here (unless they don&#039;t want to be traced for whatever reason).&nbsp; You definitely can&#039;t make serious cash selling legal products.

				Ebooks and fake ID docs seem like the two biggest sellers. Also you could offer a service, like writing essays for slackers&nbsp; :P (although I believe there&#039;s already a vendor who does this)...
