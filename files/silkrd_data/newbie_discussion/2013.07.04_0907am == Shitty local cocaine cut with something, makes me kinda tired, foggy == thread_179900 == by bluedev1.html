				numbs, heart beat is up, but doesnt feel like coke really... smells a little off, kinda sweeter smelling, doesnt have that euphoria rush, doesnt make me wanna keep doing more, little bit more of a bitter drip, more like a foggy headspace, almost sedated, any ideas what that might be?

				oh and it doesn&#039;t numb right away but it numbs a bit &quot;harder&quot; and longer for sure.<br /><br />i know coke can be cut with all kinds of shit but not sure if there have been trends that exhibit similar qualities or anything like that.

				yeah im gonna bring it back to him and tell him to give me somethin else or my money back.&nbsp; itd be one thing if i was some crackhead fool whod take anything, but actually i have a good job, he knows im smart and he knows i know what good coke is and he knows i know all the bullshit dealers pull every time, &quot;yeah i got this new stuff, blah blah blah&quot;, the only reason i even give him business anymore is because SR isnt always convenient for a last minute night out.&nbsp;

				you&#039;re telling me - put an order in from SA over 3 weeks ago because i got a party this saturday to go to, thought it would get here in plenty of time and it&#039;s the first time i&#039;ve actually been this organised for anything. fucking thing still hasn&#039;t shown up so i put another order in with a euro vendor on monday and i&#039;m praying it gets here for the weekend. if i buy any of that shite it&#039;ll just ruin the night for me &gt;:(

				well I tried this:<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.php?ID=3129<br /><br />most likely mine is:<br />Procaine hydrochloride: Melts, producing much white fumes with mild chlorine odor. The molten mass turns yellow, progresses to dark gold and leaves a golden-brown stain. <br /><br />garbage.

				I was replying telling you what it was but I see you already discovered for your own.<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s procaine, total garbage. Some idiot dealers sell it as &quot;coke&quot; but it has nothing to do with it.
