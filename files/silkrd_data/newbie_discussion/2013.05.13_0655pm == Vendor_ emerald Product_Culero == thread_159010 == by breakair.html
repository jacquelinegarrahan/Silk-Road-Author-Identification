				I ordered the 5Gr bullet around the time SR was under attack, April 25th/26th, around that time. Somehow, I managed to log on and place my orders just before the site went down. 4 days of nail biting tension ensued..... I&#039;m sure this is a familiar story for some of you. <br /><br />Communication 10/10<br />When the site finally went back up, you can imagine my glee to find a message from emerald, apologizing for not being in touch due to the site being down and reassuring me that my order had been shipped as normal, the day after it was placed. <br /><br />Delivery and Packaging 10/10<br />Sure enough, the next day, a nice discrete package was deposited on my doormat. No odor, well sealed, printed address label, return address, plain package, a textbook stealth operation.<br /><br />Product 10/10<br />Triple sealed inside I found the bullet. I unwrapped it and it was sticky to the touch and smelled perfect. I couldn&#039;t bend it in my hands but when I put my lighter to it, it bubbles and boils&nbsp; :P<br />I could cut it with a pair of scissors and just leaving a small chunk in a warm place for a few minutes makes it soft enough to roll into impossibly long snakes or even into sheets that are almost translucent, they are so thin. So you get high, and you have playdough!&nbsp; ;D<br />Outside it is black and sticky, when I cut it with the scissors it is green inside and smells great!<br />When I smoked this with my friends, we giggled like we did when we were kids for a few seconds, which was a lot of fun. I haven&#039;t seen hash like this where I live in a long time. <br /><br />It is a little expensive when compared to other hashes out there, but it really is lovely lovely stuff and the vendor can be trusted. I&#039;m reordering today
