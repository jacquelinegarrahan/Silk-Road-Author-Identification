				Hello, I forgot my password it seems although I&#039;m nearly 100% positive I&#039;m tying in the correct pass.<br /><br />Problem is I have two (2) orders pending that are digital and won&#039;t be able to finalize.<br /><br />I also have $600 in cash.&nbsp; Is there any way to have the cash in that account sent back to the wallet it was sent from?

				Hmm..I&#039;m still learning about the whole process.<br /><br />Ultimately right now.. your funds are locked in escrow.<br /><br />There must be a silk road tech support of some sort...

				Your orders will auto-finalize 17 days after they were marked in transit and your coins will sit in your account. There&#039;s no way to verify you are who you say you are so I doubt there&#039;s anything you can do about it other than brainstorm for that password and try over and over again. <br />That&#039;s some shitty luck, hope it works out for you.
