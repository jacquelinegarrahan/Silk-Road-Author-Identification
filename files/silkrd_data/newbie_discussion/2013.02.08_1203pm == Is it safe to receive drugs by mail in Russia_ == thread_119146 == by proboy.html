				if the vendor has good stealth then it&#039;ll get through pretty much anywhere. message the vendor and ask about success rates to your country if you&#039;re not sure. maybe check out the penalties if you get caught. weigh up the risk vs reward. it&#039;s never &#039;safe&#039; while illegal though.

				Play it safe and don&#039;t use your own name, and deliver the package somewhere else.

				When I think Russia, I don&#039;t exactly think Safety... hopefully the vendor reviews will help. Too bad there&#039;s no way to tell if other buyers are in Russia, which would be helpful to see how the shipping there goes.

My friend got caught recieving mdma powder from NL.<br />Do not order from Netherlands - russian customs &#039;like&#039; this country a lot.<br /><br />Just follow these rules &gt;&gt; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18644.0<br />NEVER EVER go to post office - especially if you ordered via NOT registered mail, and suddenly postal notification arrives instead of letter.<br />If caught, KEEP SILENCE. DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING A.C.A.B. WILL FORCE YOU TO SIGN. DO NOT EVEN TAKE A PEN IN YOUR HANDS. It can&#039;t be stressed enough. They will threaten you. Very effectively. Endure it, do not surrender and talk - or they&#039;ll win. It&#039;s very hard to accuse you in possessing unless you are scared pussy and would tell them everything by yourself.<br /><br />

				You know, I read that online guide to using SR that probably everyone&#039;s read, and I think it&#039;s great that he got modafinil from France.&nbsp; But, personally, being in the US, I don&#039;t place orders with anyone outside the US for one simple reason: customs.&nbsp; As a former Army Special Ops, I saw US customs from both sides of the counter, and there seems to be no upward limit of what kind of detection limits might be deployed against packaging.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand, there are almost no detection opportunities within the USPS.&nbsp; If you have to have it and it can only be gotten from Russia, then you just have to weigh the risk vs. reward.&nbsp; But, your best bet is to try to get it domestically.
