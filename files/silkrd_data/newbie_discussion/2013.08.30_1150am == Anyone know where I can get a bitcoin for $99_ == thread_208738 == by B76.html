				You can buy it on the OTC for 99$ when they cost 90$ since people want at least 10% above avg. for PPUSD.&nbsp; ::) But then again why would you want to buy with paypal?

				So i know how you can get BTC for anywhere from6%-10% above MtGox and you get them in about 5min! <br /><br />So i was speaking with the guy i buy BTC from, and after some negotiating he asked me if i would make mention of him. I of course said yes. This guy is extremely fast and professional. He sells through a CLEARNET site in a number of ways. Since i know how good of a guy this man is I would pay you any amounnt lost though dealing with bitman. Check out his website he has a few ways to get in touch with him, and hes available almost 24/7 somehow! Enjoy.<br /><br /><br />***WARNING*CLEARNET*SITE*BELOW***<br />bitman.biz<br /><br />***IM SO SURE THIS GUY IS LEGIT, IF SOMETHING EVER HAPPENS I WILL PAY YOU BACK DOUBLE MAKE IT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT IN BTC OR HEROIN.***<br /><br />***please tell him &quot;the forum guy&quot; told you about him and we both get taken care of! :-) thanks all ttys***

				Check around on localbitcoins on Clearnet&nbsp; &nbsp;if the price drops low enough or maybe someone just needs money fast.&nbsp; All sorts of local sellers in my area in a pretty wide range, usually right around Mt Gox but a few much higher... the real low ones always are too far away to justify the gas.&nbsp; Never mind PP, just give them cash in a wifi zone with yr computer running to make sure everythings legit.&nbsp; It works.

				No, not really unless you know someone who is holding plenty and doesn&#039;t mind losing money. Your best bet is localbitcoins. and look for a straight cash deposit into a bank account. i found some that are 117-125. my usual guy is always 5 over the weighted price unless i buy more than 1000 usd which i neber have. lol. check it out. with the bitcoin rising everyday doesnt seem 99 will be around for months to come. it was just 87 a btc 2 months ago. come back down please. glad SR pegs it to the dollar!!

				well if you contact bitman and ask him to set up a cash deposit with ESCROW on localbitcoins im sure he would gladly do it! please mention the forum guy and he will do even small custom amounts in escrow!<br /><br />clearnet:&nbsp; &nbsp;bitman.biz
