				I have a buyer account on the road and here are the stats:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year<br />total transactions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43<br />total spent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$115.61 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$668.43 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$6,949.20<br />refund rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />auto-finalize rate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%<br />I have been a member for 9months.Christy Nuggs requires an established buyer history of 8 months and i have finally bought some of her famous blue dream haze. Im not leaving the Road. Im merely starting a new buyer account and hoping to get some coins by selling this one to the highest bidder. I will be selling my account to the highest bidder over the next 24hrs, just PM me. If you are accepted then I will send you a message with a bitcoin address to deposit the coins.<br />The coins from your purchase of my buyer account will be funneled back onto the road.<br /><br />Being an established buyer can get you ALOT of things on the road!<br /><br />After the coins are in the account I will PM you the name of my buyer account with the login information and PIN number.<br />Immediately after logging in you need to change the passphrase and PIN number.

				interesting... <br />i wonder if this is allowed. <br />anyway. i second newvendors question. how much are you thinking about? or in other words: what is your minimum price? PM me.<br /><br />extra thought:<br />if this becomes usual business i really hope that vendors don&#039;t start keeping adresses to make sure that account A still is the same person as in the last 20 transactions.

The forums cannot be used for sales, and cannot be used for advertising items unless those items are offered for sale in a listing on the main site.<br /><br />Your buyer account is yours to do with as you please; however, offering an account for sale on a clearnet website (such as Gumtree) when it has a verifiable history of illegal transactions - and presumably accepting payment for it via a relatively traceable method - wouldn&#039;t be the smartest idea.<br /><br />Other vendors could, in theory, list your account for you. However, they would be leaving themselves open to a lot of risk if either party is dissatisfied with the trade as it is the vendor&#039;s feedback that would take the hit.<br /><br />Libertas

				I wouldnt purchase a buyers account for any reason from a brand new forum user that claims to be a long time member with flawless stats. His post also seems weird. I feel like there is a good chance that this is a scam and I advice potential customers against doing business with this shady character.
