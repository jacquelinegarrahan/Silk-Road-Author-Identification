				Always use vacuum seals, multiple even, depending on what you&#039;re shipping. Always use drop boxes, as they&#039;re completely anonymous. Postage doesn&#039;t matter much, just treat it like a regular package, because that&#039;s how you want it to be perceived. No excessive taping or anything else that will draw attention to it. If you&#039;re only shipping domestic, the risk is very low. Thousands of people do the same as you do, only with eBay or something like that.

				Ideally vacuum seal. The bags aren&#039;t expensive.

				Vac it multiple times, use gloves so you have no fingerprints on your packages, print the address instead of writing it, use stamps onto which you don&#039;t have to spit so they hold, put a sender adress onto the package which is nearly located to the box where you drop it into, don&#039;t put everything into one box.<br /><br />That should be enough for domestic packages.

				Most mail is business related, so make it most business looking you can.<br />Use standard envelopes or boxes, always print the name and address.<br />Don&#039;t use all BIG CAPS :)
