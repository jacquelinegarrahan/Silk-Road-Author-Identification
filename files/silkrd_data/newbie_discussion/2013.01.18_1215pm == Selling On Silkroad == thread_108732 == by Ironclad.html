				Okay first of all I&#039;m new. I understand how Bitcoin works, GPG, all of that. I&#039;ve known about them for a while now but this is my first time really using this site. I did read the Wiki but it doesn&#039;t explain how to put things up for sale on the main site. I do not have any bitcoins at the moment, I would like to obtain some by making sales though.<br /><br />Can someone help me out?

				You have to upgrade to a sellers account to be able to put up listings. To do that, click &#039;Account&#039; &gt;&gt;&gt; Go to right hand side of page, see list. Click &#039;become a seller&#039;.<br /><br />It will cost you approx $500 to get a sellers account, and you have to have that in bitcoin to pay for it. There are numerous threads on the forums on how to obtain bitcoin. Just do plenty of research and be sure you know you&#039;re being safe when it comes to getting the coins to SR from the clear web. :)<br /><br />

				In your &#039;account&#039; section there&#039;s a link to becoming a seller. <br /><br />I was thinking of doing a bit of selling on the side but was put off by the rather large deposit required. You can apply to get it back after you hit 30 sales though.

				Some vendors give courses on every aspect of vending. But you&#039;ll get there without them with patience and common sense. The only thing I would need help on is money laundering.

				you have to pay for a sellers account and then start sellinf i think, :). i don&#039;t think it must be fantastic for the sellers though, i mean c&#039;mon, waiting for the money, money in escrow, dealing with criminal underground figures, and then the risk that peeps gonna say they havn&#039;t got it. SR is deffnetly a buyers market and not a seller one. WHERE could you have access to all these different drugs? I don&#039;t think there is any1 out there with contacts to be able to get all the drugs that are avaible on here.....truly a thing of genius and marvel.&nbsp;
