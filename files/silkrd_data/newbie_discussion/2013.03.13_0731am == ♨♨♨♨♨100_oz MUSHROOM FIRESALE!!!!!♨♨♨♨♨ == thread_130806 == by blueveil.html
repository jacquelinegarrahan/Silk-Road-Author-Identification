				********WE CAN NOW TRACK ALL SHIPMENTS********<br /><br />1oz Mushrooms(whole or powdered)-$120-http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/f1f043396b<br /><br />4oz Mushrooms(whole or powdered)-$400-silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c06fee896f<br /><br />Prices are before silk road fees and shipping.<br /><br />Know that when you buy from blueveil, you are supporting REAL job creation in the USA. Profits are going towards REGISTERED 501c charities and not towards some heartless drug cartel or eventually to the government via money launderers or worse through taxes and political funding. Lets show our nation that there are people willing to initiate some real change!<br /><br />First and foremost we are here to serve our customers. If for any reason you would give me less than 5/5 let me know so I can try and correct it. I want happy repeat customers so I tend to load on the heavy side.<br />Come on over and join our tribe! At Blueveil you aren&#039;t just an order number or a username or a dollar sign. With blueveil you are a tribesman/tribeswoman. We are here to serve our tribe and treat them like the royalty they are. If you need trip set and setting advice, dosage recommendations, special orders, or any other service feel free to contact me and I will do my best to return your query ASAP. Anything below this type of customer service is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. We want you around for some time to come and make sure that we are keeping your identity as safe and secure as possible. We encourage everyone to learn to use PGP even if you only want to order once from SR. No one should go to prison for expanding their minds and we would hate for you to lose your freedom. If you have feedback or suggestions we welcome them and take the markets opinion very seriously. Your voice determines how this market operates so support other good vendors out there and lets make this place the premier spot to score our fun of choice.<br /><br /><br />Cast your vote at Tribal Council on me!!<br />(Review Thread)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95294.0<br /><br />Feeling like sharing? Join the Drum Circle and share a mushroom induced trip report here!!<br />(Trip Report Thread)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95295.0<br /><br />*/*/*/*/*IMPORTANT SHIPPING UPDATE*\*\*\*\*<br />By ordering you are agreeing with the following:<br /><br />*****As a vendor I work hard at shipping and I am able to track packages once more!!! I have only had 1 package returned and it was because the buyer used a FAKE NAME. I will not RESHIP or REFUND for ANY reason. Make sure you use an REAL address AND name that will not be an issue. If you are a long time buyer with me we might work something out but I&#039;m talking a LONG TIME buyer.*****<br /><br />New people can order but do realize I track shipments and will not reship or refund for any reason. If I feel a situation is sketchy I reserve the right to cancel the order.<br /><br />I ship out mon-wed for security purposes and am not the vendor to use on short notice. If SR ever goes down I can be contacted at blueveil@tormail.org and I also leave a BMR account open and updated so that if SR goes down you can get your shrooms fast. Note that I will not view that email while SR is up.<br /><br />I only take bitcoins so please do not break the rules and ask me to take something else.<br /><br />Please make sure you get enough coins to buy what I list as I will not be making changes to prices.<br /><br />I feel that with issues like risk, I provide a wonderful value and ease of mind on product handling and quality testing. I periodically have each batch tested by people not on SR and they LOVE them. We only ship out the finest quality mushrooms.<br /><br />Here is my pgp and I suggest you use it when sending shipping info. Please do not encrypt random chit chat.<br /><br /><br />PLEASE SAVE THIS KEY SO WE CAN TALK IF SR EVER GOES DOWN!!!!<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBE/T1yYBCACh0eh5FeExyZL/qKCAPN+F/ZVSVafOOwmhPZADNC7Iln9oqmmf<br />OZrkyfnl0D3HOjJ2n8cdYMoUrJD32YpVt8mpxT0Col2Mhi71y78aMFZ/ER0FLYMJ<br />7hawRiZnqNCQHoVfP2jHHOTBoNLfNmnTuMzfvn6X092DQWgnCWp12U9m7CXt5nr9<br />ySouV7bhQ1bnOr/nEPfvS1cTk0mqMqheD6X/a1p7Wg8xZQPbAa+kXEwGwXPT5/wC<br />6GjsmOq+9YK5hezIJL9gsFKrT3fuVJLwKMqOrSDE7/kydVBoek/kbRnTek9Mg7bT<br />v4w0PqdL6GUdG+55/QwHXk2jyPINrR/j3DLtABEBAAG0Hi9iL2FzZGYgPGJsdWV2<br />ZWlsQHRvcm1haWwub3JnPokBOAQTAQIAIgUCT9PXJgIbDwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoL<br />BBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQLRYGDFT3jvUdFwf9EnfwPqX53fqWZtbxMEct+/+c1oGR<br />D8vPxBDTVzitxusK1krwH1+fP77eIlPnTRfXJFs3g4jXiQL4byvi+91DMxL9kTt3<br />ZCsJzCXLH26t+PeF7oh5IwppvKeyYW/+00BInC8o+5NqopYoWMd4LSQIyNYaUuhG<br />5kTOaSOIPQd47vPtsgxOUCmp8eLxg8/h1xnf79TZABAMb83igTP905UrSXUl6nxw<br />svHCTWzm+wsaJfXACRT9DAGHRwaEErj2106oNwj5lCl5UyVc+0ipW7d6LmsY7kgn<br />c/4jOsAaSR4U3vLryARXNVSi3otuXlTYf57pdAy+0Co3ea0806iQcBSRAw==<br />=G98m<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br /><br /><br />******Bulk Orders******<br />We will be also offering custom orders from 8oz-1lb and beyond.

				What&#039;s the advantage of powdered vs whole? <br /><br />I&#039;d imagine that gelcapping would be tedious at best given the volume you&#039;d need to eat...
