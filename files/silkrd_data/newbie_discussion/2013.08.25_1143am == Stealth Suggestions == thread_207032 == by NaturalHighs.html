				Hi Guys<br /><br />Forgot to ask in the previous post - does anyone have any good suggestions for cost effective stealth? We will be posting marjiuana, already have Moisture Barrier Bags (MBBs), however we noticed that other vendors have suffered bad ratings for only using MBBs.<br /><br />Much Appreciated

				Hey there OP. Unfortunately its unlikely that any one that actually has advice from experience or their own practices will not be likely to share this. Especially not publicly. <br /><br />Typically going into specifics about stealth is a no no here. For obvious reasons. I can say that if I where you, i would make triple vacuum sealing each order a standard. Thats not including the MBB as the fourth layer of packaging. To be extra secure, i would get creative and maybe find a way to obtain bulk amounts of very cheap nicknacks or toys to use for real ninja like packaging. Best of luck.

				Thank you very much your input, as you probably guessed we are new vendors - did not know we were asking an awkward question, we apologise if anyone was offended, was not asking for anyone to reveal their practices.

				The new molecular lasers they want to use in airports soon, may be be used for the postal system too. Then it is important to know how deep they can go through certain material and to enter the molecular-stealth-wars strong and prepared to win<br /><br />
