				So i made a seller account, and i was wondering how long it usually takes before a first costumer arrives. Because the way i see it, no one wants to buy from someone that has no reviews yet.

				As someone new to the road, and someone that researches ALOT before jumping in to anything, I try and avoid new vendors with no reviews, I am sure it is hard to new vendors to get a foot hold, but I would imagine that taking an initial hit in profits by giving away some samples would gather a quick following, I am not saying give away the bank, but offering something up for a few of the veteran buyers would spread the word pretty quick I am sure.&nbsp; With the prices that vendors can charge here you will be sure to make back any losses pretty quickly.&nbsp; And anyone that comes on here selling quality product, and ships quick will have a huge following in no time.&nbsp; Just like any business it takes some up front investment.

				I agree, samples are probably about the only way. I don&#039;t think many people would buy from someone with no reviews. You&#039;ll either have to give a few things away for free or really cheap to get your first few reviews and get started. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll make it back after the initial investment. What are you selling? Link us to your vendor account.

				Yep, take the hit and decide how many samples of whatever you are selling you can give away in exchange for fair reviews...<br /><br />Make a review thread in the newbie forum for your vendor account and when you can in the general forums so folks can review you and keep your name out there. <br /><br />Put a link to your vendor page in your signature so whenever you post, interested prospective buyers can get to your vendor page easily. <br /><br />Good luck.

				hey mate if you have cheap product that&#039;s easy to package 20-30 samples should get you bumpin&#039; if you&#039;re something worth looking at. if its a more costly product for you offer 10-20 samples at a discounted price make sure the samplers are adamant about testing and reviwing your gear and have them post on the forums about it too, do this and I promise you&#039;ll have a bunch of more order&#039;s Im about to start samples on my LSD WoW AGAIN ( I put out samples before but I guess a month is too long for anyone to remember)
