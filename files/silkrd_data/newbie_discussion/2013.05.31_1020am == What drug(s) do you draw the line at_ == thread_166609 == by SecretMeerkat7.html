				For me personally, I&#039;ve always told myself that I would never try heroin, GHB, or DMT.&nbsp; I used to have meth on that list, but I did end up trying it once and had a pleasurable experience, but never had the urge to do it again.&nbsp; I think mostly because I enjoy MDMA so much that I would simply prefer to do it instead.&nbsp;

				GHB is a Tylenol PM in comparison to meth. It&#039;s really mild and pleasant. <br />Heroin is serious shit. But DMT is as serious as shit gets. Although, it only last about 15 minutes if you smoke it. <br /><br />I draw the line at psychedelics with obscenely long half-lives. I would never want to be on anything longer the 6 hours. Especially if we&#039;re talking about a drug that is as far removed from &quot;normal&quot; as a psychedelic.

				Good thread. I&#039;m a pussy and terrified of addiction so I stay away from the big boys. No heroin, crack or any of that scary stuff. I&#039;m quite secure in my drugs of choice and I don&#039;t tend to deviate from my list. I stick to the stuff I know I can control, so mdma, ketamine, weed, lsd, mushrooms, those sorts of things. I&#039;ve got most of the bases covered there and I&#039;m not that inquisitive about other substances. Boring, I know.

				In my case i dont draw the line on the drug but the quality and the dose,and lastly theamount and interval on the dose given . i would never try Krocodile , huffing or Scopolamine or any other drug not intended for humans but other than that ive tried most everything else. not sure i would shoot snake venom either or other stupid methods but then agian many people fail to realize no matter what you do it&#039;s all about as doug stanhope says excess in moderation.

				Crack, meth, heroin. I have too much of an addictive personality, and even if I didn&#039;t, the nutcases I see walking around my town who&#039;re obviously addicted to one of those drugs would be enough to put me off completely.<br /><br />Surprised a couple people have said DMT.

				I love a certain sort of psychedelic drugs, but I stay away from everything else.<br /><br />For me that would be weed, dmt, lsd, shrooms, mdma. I experimented with the psychadelic RC&#039;s but I never enjoyed them as much so I leave them alone now.<br /><br />I think I mostly like that with the exception of weed, I&#039;ve never had the urge to do these with any sort of frequency.

				SecretMeerkat7, I think it depends. For the first experience with any drug I would make sure you are with someone. It&#039;s good to have someone there when you don&#039;t know what to expect.<br /><br />After that first experience though, a solo trip can be very profitable. Make sure you are comfortable with the drug first, if you are alone and can&#039;t handle it, you are in for a bad time.

				there is no line (if there was i&#039;d snort it). cant stand people saying &#039;i&#039;d do this drug...but wouldnt do that one, that ones bad...&#039; you get people who quite happily snort a line of coke at a party but then when asked about crack say its a dirty drug... makes no sense to me. my theory is try it&nbsp; all, its all experience. if you dont like it dont do it again. theory is sound but if, like me, you have a tendency towards dependency you just have to watch your frequency of certain things. was a smack head for 4 years, fucking love the stuff! but cant do it more than once, twice a year now, would be too easy to slip back into old habits! cant go wrong with weed, psychedelics and mdma in my opinion :)

Start off low and its not even that psychedelic, just visual distortions, a massive body high and colors when you close your eyes.
