				Ok,<br />But this then means that the majority of buyers cannot post to the Vendors thread&nbsp; we are unlikely to have the time or inclination to make posts. OTHO, those that do post, are are engaged members of the community... so, I guess that makes sense... :-\<br />&nbsp;<br />(Just increased my post count by one!)
