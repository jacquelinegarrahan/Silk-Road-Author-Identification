				Hi, I´m from Germany and I ordered something in Czech, the seller has 100 points, but the delivery did not arrive until today.<br />Now I have 12 hours for &quot;Auto Finalize&quot;.<br />Although we had contact and he assured me that he makes a new delivery.<br />He said: &quot;Sometimes mail gets lost in the czech post when dropped in the mail box &quot;<br />Next Time hey ask, what did I order, Just for remind him. Is it possible, he don´t know?<br /><br />I have a feeling that he is playing for time, to get to the Auto Finalize.<br />What should I do, I&#039;m new here and don´t want to make him any problems, maybe it´s really is not his fault, but I paid for without receiving anything.<br /><br />What should I do now?

				You need to use the &quot;resolve&quot; link and take it to resolution.&nbsp; There, you and the vendor can negotiate on how to handle it.&nbsp; Make sure you do this BEFORE it auto-finalizes on you!

				^^ go to resolution. Don&#039;t bad mouth the vendor though. He might be right and the package was lost or seized. There&#039;s no point in doing that until you have no recourse and he actually did fuck you over.

				I wrote him that I wait until the last hour. I want him insinuate anything, but I must also protect me.<br />I am correct with each and I also expect.<br />What happens if I click on resolve?<br /><br />Now I see, he has 99 Points. One have the same problem, as me.<br /><br />I don´t want to write vendor´s name here, maybe he have problems.<br /><br />Thanks for the quick response

				Okay, thank you. <br />Is it bad for him, if I resolve now? I don´t want to make him problems.<br />Sorry for asking this, but maybe he have problems. <br /><br />But I think, I have to do it, because if he now write, he will send, it Auto Finalize...<br /><br />Now I understand, thank you very much for your help.
