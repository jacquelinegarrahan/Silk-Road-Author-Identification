				Hi There! We are a new US vendor who is making various candies from RC&#039;s from china. - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/293f9977bf<br />The first sets of samples of the Moxy Rancher Gummy Cubes have gone out this thread is for customers to post replies or trip reports for an of our future products.<br /><br />The gummy cubes have a rather short shelf-life (3 days before mold growth at room temp) after you open the vaccum sealed bag.<br />To prevent this we will be vaccum sealing 5 at time on future orders until we perfect a hard candy equivalent.<br />We suggest you place your package of vaccum sealed gummies into the refrigerator or freezer for 5-10 min to cool them to a solid state if it is rather warm outside. (although you can drink the hot liquid gel as well kiddos)<br />Afterwards, put them in a zip lock bag and keep them cool.<br />Don&#039;t open your gummies untill you are ready to eat them, they will stay fresher in the vaccum bag. :)<br />5-Meo-MiPT is absorbed through the mouth and through the stomach, either way you will feel its effects.<br /><br />Feel free to ask questions!<br /><br />We look forward to your future business,<br />CandyKingdom

				&nbsp;:)<br />i ordered a sample of candykingdom&#039;s &quot;Moxy Rancher Gummy Cubes&quot; last week and it was well worth the money<br /><br />Shipping: 5/5&nbsp; Standard prepaid box with label 400 on it, visual barrier, and secured slightly.<br /><br />Product 6/5 HOLY SHIT THESE BAD BOYS ROCK!! Only needed 1!!! Def a good roll-trip candy-flip type high. WILL BUY AGAIN!<br /><br />I really like MDMA and i&#039;ve had some of supertrips moon rock shit and this euphoric feeling from the gummy bears was comparable.<br /><br />Not really all that trippy, but tons of color enhancements and shifting that made me feel really good.<br /><br />Music SOUNDS AWESOME and even makes the visuals cue.<br /><br />Cant wait to place an order for 50 of these things. They could easily sell for $15-20 around here.<br /><br />------<br /><br />EDIT: UPDATE! OKAY IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN YOU EAT MORE OF THEM THE VISUALS GET MUCH MORE INTENSE!!! SIT DOWN SPACE COWBOY! YOU DONT WANNA JOIN THE 5+ CLUB!!!! LOLOLOLOL<br /><br />

				Product was AWSOME!!!! Wish you could get rid of that bitter chem taste but lets be realistic it prob won&#039;t happen but being in gummy form its super easy to eat and swallow. If you are an average sized person DEFINITELY start with a half gummy, my buddy started with full one and it knocked him on his ass lol. A very MDMA feel to it which is a huge plus, lights were enhanced, very euphoric feeling, I have a rather large tolerance to any chem going into my body so I ate 2 to myself and loved it! PLEASE RESTOCK ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! candykingdom I fucking love you guys

				So i finally got the chance to try out the gummies, and all i can say is wow.&nbsp; This is my first time with moxy and me and my girl had a ton of fun.&nbsp; I took a bit more than half and she took the rest.&nbsp; I really appreciated this chemical being in gummy form as it would of been hard as hell to dose.&nbsp; It made it reall quick and easy.&nbsp; Also cant argue with green apple!&nbsp; Now going in, i was anticipating a bit of a 2cb like experience, what i got was more roll like and less visuals.&nbsp; I felt a bit sped up and stimulated and had a big grin on my face most of the night.&nbsp; We didnt really do much other than watch some shows, talk, listen to music, and of course sex.&nbsp; We usually save actually expanding what we do after we get a feel for a new substances effects.&nbsp; Now sex was definitely enhanced, but not to the point of 2cb in my mind (we actually prefer sex on 2cb to mdma, so it would of been some feat to overtake it).&nbsp; Also something i did not expect was smell and taste to be so enhanced.&nbsp; Was quite a shock when we got out the bold chex mix and the smell almost overpowered us.&nbsp; At the doses we took, we did not get much in the visuals department.&nbsp; Next time we are going to be taking a whole one and have a fantastic time the roll-like feeling will be improved and i hope for a bit more in the visuals.&nbsp; All in all an amazing vendor and an amazing product. Will be coming back for more for sure.

				Hello friend, I am really sorry for not posting this review sooner, but it is very detailed.<br /><br />First off, I&#039;d like to say me and my friends had a splendid time on this compound and I&#039;d like to address it fully in a subjective breakdown using an index that I have used before. This is not simply a copy and paste but rather a thorough and investigative analysis of this substance. As for the vendors general quality, I was very happy with it in every way.<br /><br />Subjective effects:<br /><br />Physical effects:<br /><br />The body high of 5-MeO-MIPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all encompassing glow. There is also a cold, sharp tingling sensation that is manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip but for others it can maintain a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.<br /><br />In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 5-MeO-MIPT can be both sedating and stimulating. The physical energy levels seem to manifest themeselves in waves in an unpredictable pattern. This seems to be partially setting dependant and during physically strenuous situations such as running or dancing it can become stimulating and energetic. In contrast however, in calm environments such as darkened rooms with comfortable seating it can become relaxing, peaceful and even moderately sedating.<br /><br />Negative Physical Effects:<br /><br />As the tripper begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, but passes once this has either happened or the trip begins to fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as psilocin, LSD, and 2C-E, this could actually be very considered very mild in its intensity. In comparison to 5-MeO-DIPT, 5-MeO-MIPT has a much lower tendency to trigger unpleasant physical reactions and has been described as much less physically stimulating.<br /><br />Cognitive effects:<br /><br />The head space of 5-MeO-MIPT is described by many as is described by many as one which is both insightful and moderately relaxing. This manifests itself as two different styles of head space that depend both on the setting and the way in which this drug manifests its self in waves. For example, when taken with others these effects seems to have very strong entactogenic effects, which can become quite stimulating. When taken alone however psychedelic introspection is present. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA but still are prove stronger and more consistent than most other psychedelics of any class, this is capable of providing long lasting therapeutic effects. It contains a large number of typical cognitive effects.<br /><br />The most prominent of these typical effects include,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Introspection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Acceleration of thought<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Increased connectivity of thought<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Enhancement of current mind state<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Removal of cultural filter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Feelings of fascination and awe<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Conceptual thinking<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ego suppression, loss and death<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Time distortion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Communication with the subconscious<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Deja-vu<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Entactogenic effects (increased empathy and sociability) <br /><br />Visual effects:<br /><br />Enhancements:<br /><br />5-MeO-MIPT presents a complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Increased visual acuity<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Enhancement of colours<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Enhanced pattern recognition <br /><br />Distortions:<br /><br />As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Visual drifting (melting, breathing, warping and flowing) - In comparison to other psychedelics this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in their appearance.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tracers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; After images<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Texture repetition<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Colour shifting<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Scenery slicing <br /><br />Geometry:<br /><br />The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of Psilocin than LSD. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. At higher dosages they are significantly more likely to result in states of level 7B visual geometry over level 7A.<br /><br />In terms of their manifestation they are progressive in nature and continuously self complexify in settings with little or no visual input and disturbances. For example, darkness will cause the geometry to progressively intensify but this can immediately be reset back down to base level by simply turning on a bright light or actively performing a physical task which requires any level of concentration.<br />Hallucinatory states<br /><br />5-MeO-MIPT is capable of producing level 1-3 hallucinatory states and has been reported to produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states. These effects include,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Transformations<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Imagery<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hallucinations - this particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively religious, spiritual, mystical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. <br /><br />Auditory effects:<br /><br />The auditory effects of 5-MeO-MIPT are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Auditory enhancements<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Auditory distortions<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Auditory hallucinations <br /><br />In conclusion, 5-MeO-MIPT is an extremely interesting tryptamine psychedelic and reminds me of a strange mix between mushrooms or 4-aco-dmt and 2C-B. It had many ayahuasca like effects including communication with subconcious, induced spiritual effects, and very organic visuals that blended with a strange contradictory mdma like enactogenic feel. I highly reccomend this substance.
