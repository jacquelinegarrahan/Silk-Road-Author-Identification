			<dd class="postbody">
				Looking for fellow newbies opinions on receiving goods from SR. <br /><br />I have posted before my package receiving technique which as I&#039;m overly paranoid- Bank of lockers for postal drops in a supermarket, paid for using a pre paid cash card, under a false name on a pre paid phone so there is no link to me what so ever. This is due to my crazy drug hating girlfriend and my jobs 0% tolerance to any criminal acts.<br /><br />What do you guys do? Do you take the risk and use your home address? or are you as paranoid as me and use a drop address?<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure whether it is worth the hassle for me to keep using the drop (seeing as my purchases will be 4g Coke, 50X 10mg Diazepam and a few grams of skunk once a month) or to just start using the home address?

				Good to know someone else is like me&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />I like you idea and thinking about it I have a neighbor like that down the road, do you have the post addressed to a fake name then? the only problem I have with the plan is what if the day they decide to check the mail is the day your package arrives? Would you knock and ask for it? or call it a day and find a new drop?

				I use a fake name<br /><br />It happened to me once, and he got my letter but since it wasn&#039;t addressed to him he just left it outside his box (i live in a building and all of them boxes are in the same place) <br />The old man probably thought the mailman will take the letter back to the post office<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit risky cause you can lose a package but it&#039;s way better then feds knocking down your door<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks Mcguire39 main thing is as the lockers are in a 24/7 supermarket can also go whenever is convenient and you know it&#039;s going to be empty (which for me is usually 2am with my hood up lol)<br /><br />TheDead I see what you mean, thought you meant it was a on residential street. To be honest that&#039;s perfect then. I need a few more back up ideas just in case my current one fails.<br /><br />I have just ordered five packages at once (got a little carried away) do you guys think there is any difference ordering more/less? Making it more risky etc

				to my knowledge as long as your address ain&#039;t flagged than you&#039;re all good<br /><br />I actually have this new idea I might use but you&#039;ll need a building for that too<br />my friend told me his mailman leaves any package that doesn&#039;t have an apartment number outside the boxes so that anyone who&#039;s the letter belongs to can take it (as if someone just &quot;forgot&quot; to write the apartment number) - I think this is gonna be perfect<br />I have no connection to this building + using different fake names, I will just grab my letters by night

If it too big to go through a letter box, it&#039;s less likely to get a prod from mbb. Another factor is almost certainly account age and usage - new accounts should be &#039;broken in&#039; with non-SR deliveries. Return addresses are also important, again just our thoughts and observations.

If it too big to go through a letter box, it&#039;s less likely to get a prod from mbb.

				The advantage in having it delivered to your house, other than convenience, is you have plausible deniability. Maybe the package was sent you by mistake. Maybe someone sent a decoy package to your house. Maybe someone is trying to get you in trouble. Just because a package arrived at your house isn&#039;t proof you ordered it. If you get caught going to pick up the package, though, that will be a harder sell.<br /><br />If you are worried cops are going to come busting through your door just don&#039;t open the package immediately. Wait a day or two.

I have been told though never to order anything to P.O box addresses as they are usually checked more thoroughly.
