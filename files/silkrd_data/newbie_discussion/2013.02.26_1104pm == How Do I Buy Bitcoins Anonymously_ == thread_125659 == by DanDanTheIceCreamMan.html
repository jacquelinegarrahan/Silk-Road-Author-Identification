				Hey DanDanTheIceCreamMan, some customers of ours have told me they&#039;ve used sites like bitinstant.com, campbx.com or mtgox.com and have stayed anonymous in doing so. Hope those sites helped you out man but if they didn&#039;t I&#039;m sorry I couldn&#039;t of been more help.<br /><br /><br />MMM

				Thank you for the help android, axeman, marley, and monstermash. I think I may start using the moneypaks. I&#039;m currently using mtgox but just using bank transfers. its quick and reliable I just don&#039;t want the nosey IRS(or anyone for that matter) asking why I&#039;m wiring thousands of dollars to a bank in japan.

				With any service that uses Moneygram to accept cash, you give info over the phone, so there&#039;s no way they can check it, and you can give false info. When I did this at CVS, the clerk who rang up the whole thing didn&#039;t ask for info either, she just took my money. The problem, obviously, is that if anything goes haywire with the transaction, you&#039;re screwed, because they&#039;re very likely going to ask for ID, not just the receipt, before they refund your money.<br /><br />Now, what service uses Moneygram? Bitinstant does, but their Moneygram -&gt; BTC-e has been down for a week, and isn&#039;t up at this point. Even if it were, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d trust it for a while. Ziggap uses Moneygram, too. I&#039;ve used them via WU, and it worked great, but not with cash/Moneygram.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

				I should have added: do you really need to do it anonymously? Bitcoin isn&#039;t that traceable to begin with, and if you transfer from your wallet to something like Instawallet, and then to SR, after SR has tumbled them, everything should be fine.

				Thanks for the offer Sapper but seeing as how we met each other on the SR forum its very evident as to what I would be doing with them once I got them. So if PD were to give me that same offer and I met with them I would kind of fuck myself. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re not but I&#039;m not much of a gambling man. And to Ranxerox - Thank you for the advice it&#039;s looking like I might just start using the moneypaks with vendors on SR. But the reason for the anonymity isn&#039;t because of the traceability of the bitcoins, it&#039;s the fact that I&#039;m using the bank transfers to get them and the bank keeps all that info for atleast 3 years. If I continue doing it that way there&#039;s going to be a paper trail of thousands of dollars while I&#039;d have no way of proving income at which point the IRS is taking %30 of whatever I &quot;haven&#039;t claimed&quot;. That&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to avoid.
