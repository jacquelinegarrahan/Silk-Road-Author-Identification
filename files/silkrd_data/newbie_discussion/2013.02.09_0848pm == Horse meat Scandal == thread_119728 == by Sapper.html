				For those not living in the UK, the big news is that horse meat has been found in beef products.<br /><br />Because I am not a girl, a gay, or a vegetarian, I don&#039;t give a toss and readily eat horse when I visit France.<br />Horse meat is delicious, much better than beef and if you have ever been to France, then you&#039;ll know eating it is normal.<br /><br />I am so annoyed that the supermarkets here in the UK are destroying tons of food &#039;contaminated&#039; with horse DNA. Some products labelled beef turned out to be 100% horse.<br />Now being a person on a limited budget, I would just love to intercept such happenings and fill my freezer with as many of these products as possible and eat like a king for free.<br /><br />The only scandal here is the massive waste of perfectly good food.<br />FFS all they need to do is stick a label on the products in question saying &#039;May Contain Horse&#039; <br /><br />Grr<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				It annoyed me too, when the prison service reported that a load of &#039;halal&#039; beef products had been found to be contaminated with pork, and would be destroyed.<br /><br />Um. Why not just feed them to the non-muslim inmates, rather than destroying them? Fuck sake, no common sense in the lot of them.<br /><br />My parents (and grandparents) always taught me to clear my plate, and here&#039;s government departments and supermarkets just throwing away hundreds of tons of perfectly good food because of a bit of pork or horse. Not like the country isn&#039;t reeling from austerity right now, or anything...

From my experience the chickens we purchase in the supermarket compared to the&nbsp; &#039;village chickens&#039; I&#039;ve eaten abroad are entirely different birds, our chickens almost look fake to the natural chickens, but then again we expect our chickens dirt cheap £3 or so, how can you grow and nurture a chicken in the right way, sell it for £3, and expect to make a profit it&#039;s impossible! If you want a proper chicken in the UK you need to spend between £12 to £15 and this is where the problem comes in people don&#039;t want to pay,&nbsp; people want cheap meat without a second thought about where it came from and it&#039;s production, the price of beef is steadily rising in this country, people don&#039;t want to pay anymore than what in their minds they should be &#039;paying&#039;, same applies with this latest horse meat scandal there&#039;s nothing wrong with horse meat, it&#039;s readily available and accepted into the diets of continental europe, I&#039;ve seen it readily available on supermarket shelves in france and italy. The main reason why panic has ensued in the is because there is a miniscule chance the horse meat might contaminated with bute, a drug that is administrated to horses to relieve pain and treat fevers, in very rare circumstance is can trigger a serious blood disorder in humans known as aplastic anaemia which causes an acute loss of red and white blood cells and can be life threatening, this was discovered when bute was administered in humans as an anti gout treatment but was banned for human consumption decades ago. Bute may have made it&#039;s way into the horse meat that has been used in the burgers and lasagna causing fear in those who have unknowingly consumed the contaminated foods, however in reality the dose of bute that is likely to be consumed from eating a horsebuger is about a millionth of that acquired when a person was given a dose of bute as an anti-gout medication, combined with the fact that horse meat is widely eaten in france and italy without issue (meaning it&#039;s also safe for suitable for human consumption by the EU) there is nothing wrong with horse meat, the problem lies with UK consumers lack of education on unfamiliar foods and unfounded fears. Another example of this we have many lovely fishes swimming in our waters but we would rather not eat them as we fear the unknown and would rather opt for a over fished and overpriced fish called cod, but we consider what we know is safe even though it might not be. In reality the real threat to our healths doesn&#039;t come from the horse meat it comes from the high levels of salt and fat that are used in our processed foods. Give me a horse meat steak over a beef steak contaminated with BSE any day!

				like brucey said people just don&#039;t like being lied to. the amount of corruption in huge industries that&#039;s been exposed in recent times is overwhelming. <br />we&#039;ve seen loads of stuff in the media about how over the top EU regulations are causing misshapen vegetables to be wasted rather than sold and that kind of thing so when you find out people are selling horse and calling it cow people are shocked it has been allowed to happen and rightly so. <br />if you paid for some kali mist and got afghan kush you&#039;d probably be unsatisfied because it&#039;s not what you paid for. people assume the regulations mean that the food production industry is being effectively regulated and now they find out it&#039;s not. now they are displeased.

				Hmmm.... horse meat is delicious. But horse meat used to be more expensive than beef. How the hell did they manage to get it so cheap to use it as beef filler/replacement?!<br /><br />My favorite meat is still slaughtermeat, though. All sorts of leftover meat combined to make cheap processed meat products that are low in carbs and calories, and sky-high in proteins. Omnomnom.<br /><br />For the people that don&#039;t know what slaughtermeat is: Ever had Meat Ragout?

				well i assume they&#039;re using horses that haven&#039;t been farmed for food. probably old working horses past their best, or injured ones that&#039;d have to be put down. i think they&#039;ve localised the source to a place in poland. apparently they use these power hose things to get every last bit of meat and offal off the carcass which is used for cheap burgers, sausages and other &#039;minced&#039; meat type products. <br />is ragout different to italian ragu? like bolognese style. i&#039;ve made beef and lamb ragu at a place i used to work.. its just minced meat not like howards abattoir mystery meat if anyone even gets that reference :) from a purely culinary perspective i like to know what i&#039;m getting as different flavours complement each other. beef and a nice bearnaise or salmon and a creamy dill sauce amirite? some people don&#039;t give a shit so much, my ex used to have beef gravy with roast chicken and relentlessly over salt everything before even tasting it. some people have a more refined palate. incidentally they&#039;re not the people buying tesco value burgers and supermarket ready meals. if i started out with a point then i lost it, taken so much diazepam i can barely remember what i&#039;m doing :D
