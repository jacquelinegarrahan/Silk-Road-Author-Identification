				Hiya Guys. Yesterday I received my 2nd package from Miss Demeanor she is not a scammer.<br /><br />For anyone who was there when MD first began shipping almost exclusively to OZ I foolishly after waiting only a week was the first to call her a scammer (SR Acc: Forsaknlife). Swarms of scammer posts ensued and MD took down her page saying she could not deal with these people hurting her reputation and profits etc. MD cancelled my Escrow order for 1 gram and told me that when ever the package arrived it was mine to keep and Free. She was apparently done with SR. Low and behold I received my package and was impressed by all 3 attributes (Speed, Stealth, Product). I was so amazed that I messaged her and thanked her. I even put in another order not 1 day later. 15 days later (Paid for the slow shipping) I received my 2nd package, Just as great stealth and product.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t want to jump the gun as I have done in the past. I honestly think MD will come through for everyone. She is a good vendor and she won&#039;t stick around again if people have nothing but stupid and incorrect information and want to spread it.<br /><br />Regards<br />Forsaknlife
