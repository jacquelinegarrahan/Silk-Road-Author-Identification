				First thing I want to say NEVER FE.&nbsp; But it you&#039;re one of the people who have finalized early and regretted it, you can change your feedback later even if you FE&#039;d.&nbsp; Just go to you account page and click on the view feedback link on that page.&nbsp; From there click edit and you can make any changes you want.&nbsp; Many people don&#039;t know about this feature because it&#039;s hidden on the side of the account page.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve been burned, it&#039;s at least some consolation that you can make the vendor pay for it in his ranking and score.&nbsp; It seems like a lot of bad vendors who require people to FE have great scores just because a lot of people give 5 feedback in the hope that they will get their order, but then don&#039;t change it later when something goes wrong, as it often does with those vendors.<br /><br />If it was a stealth listing your feedback comments may not show up on the bottom of the vendors page, the the score still is included in the calculations of his % rating and ranking.

				I imagine this would also come in handy when you give a 5/5 rating because you received the package and everything was perfect, but you can&#039;t yet use the product... But when you do a few weeks later it turns out not to be as good as advertised.
