				The other day I sent some funds to myself using TheHiddenWiki&#039;s Instawallet, which seemed fine &amp; stable, I created a wallet &amp; saved the URL, then sent the funds to the address. After not receiving the funds for about two days, I realized that every time I refreshed the page or visited it, the wallet URL stayed the same, but, the BTC address changed every fucking time.. Not sure if it&#039;s a site glitch or a scam. I emailed their support email &amp; received no reply (as expected). Anybody have any advice here? I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s not anything I can do, but I figured I&#039;d give it a go.

Again, very sorry to hear you lost your money - take your time in future, read as much as possible and always research the service before sending them money.<br /><br />Glad to hear you&#039;re on the way to making it back though! All the best for the future! :)<br /><br />Libertas
