				really wish i wasn&#039;t a newbie for this post...<br /><br />Anyway, in the town that I live in, silk road has become quite popular. I figured out how to use it from someone about 5 months ago, and I know of two other people in my town who also use the site. So, including me, there are 4 people that I am aware of that&nbsp; order things from silk road. I only use this site for small personal amounts for me and friends, but the other three use it for bulk purchases, mainly MDMA. I live in an average sized town, not a city, and I have only met two of these people personally. Recently my friend who knows all the latest gossip, told me that one of these people was caught by the police with a little bit of molly, and admitted to the cops in my town that he/she used silk road to obtain it. Now, normally I wouldn&#039;t be worried, since the police have no power to shut down silk road ( HAHA IN YOUR FACE PIGS), but shortly after this, I received some more worrisome news: The other two people had both ordered a package from the same mdma vendor, and neither one received their package. idk how much they ordered, or when they ordered, but this is still suspicious to me, because these two people do not know each other, and are not business partners, so it seems very strange to me that BOTH their packages would be confiscated. To my knowledge, however, these two people have not gotten arrested or anything. Is it possible that the police in my town have told the post office to do a more detailed inspection of overseas packages that arrive? I have not ordered anything from here in a few months, but I am worried now that if I do, there is a chance my package might not arrive. I hope I have not revealed any incriminating evidence in this post, and if I have, please take it down. I was just hoping to get some opinions on this situation. I am going to be pissed if I&#039;m unable to use silk road anymore because of one lowly rat.

				P.S: The person who was caught with the MDMA wasn&#039;t caught ordering it in the mail. He/she happened to get pulled over with it in the car or something like that.

				It is not within their power to cross jurisdictional lines, to my knowledge.&nbsp; But it is, I believe, fully within their power to station a dog at the nearest sorting facility.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible they&#039;re taking a &quot;not in our town!&quot; mentality.<br /><br />Just a thought.

				I still can&#039;t understand why if caught in a car do you say Oh I got it off Silk Rd. Seems silly to mention your real supply source so they go digging on their computer to get some more evidence. Absolutely insane.

				I read something about mail getting siezed in some article forgot the name.&nbsp; The person who wrote it said its impossible to link you to the mail using BTC.&nbsp; Also stated that the court wouldnt even go through the process no evidence.&nbsp; Even if you sign something still hard to prosecute, but they&#039;ll look into more because you signed you know what I&#039;m saying.

				those swine won&#039;t do anything.&nbsp; local police especially won&#039;t spend their time on that, if anyone is going to investigating mail stuff it&#039;ll be the fucking dea or whatever, and they def not gonna waste their time on one assholes personal supply.&nbsp; It would probably take some much time/effort/resources to track down just one person (if even possible depending on the amount of security measures you took to &quot;anonymize&quot; yourself) that if they did attempt such a thing, it would be for someone trying to deal who is ordering loads of drugs and still... just unlikely.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t worry about the police in your town, unless your driving around breaking traffic laws with your junk in the car you know

				Don&#039;t overthink things. That&#039;s a one-way ticket to paranoia-town.<br />You/we are buying drugs online. You have to accept that their is *some* risk to all involved. <br /><br />Two people who bought mdma from the same vendor haven&#039;t received their packages? Don&#039;t read into it too much. Maybe the vendor has been arrested, in a car accident, problems with supply, etc.. a multitude of reasons could explain why the goods haven&#039;t arrived. Don&#039;t automatically assume the worst. <br /><br />

				Cops everywhere are onto the road.&nbsp; They know it&#039;s there, they just haven&#039;t been able to stop it.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that they intercepted one, figured out how that vendor is disguising his packages, and were able to use that information to stop another one.&nbsp; Or maybe the vendor himself is having issues.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t suddenly figure out that people get drugs in the mail.&nbsp; This is old news to them.
