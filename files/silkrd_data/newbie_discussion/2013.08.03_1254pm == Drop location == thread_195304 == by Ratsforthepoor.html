				Anyone have any info about using a drop location? I would have been inclined to use a real address if I had not heard people here talking of using drop locations. <br />How would you go about this without just using a friends address and getting them busted instead of you? Obviously I wouldn&#039;t want to put a friend at risk.

				Just use your real address. Don&#039;t get other people involved in your shit. If your vendor is reputable and smart they&#039;ll package it well enough that it won&#039;t be flagged by any dogs. Your chances of that happening are slim if it&#039;s done properly. Mispell your name by a letter or two and when the package arrives don&#039;t get it right away. Sometimes you can even act confused and ask the mail man where it&#039;s from. lol. Just be safe my friend!!<br /><br />Ryno

				This is never advised. Most vendors specifically ask you to use your real name and address. If you choose to used a friend or acquaintance you add extra risk. But, if you do anyway use their real name and address. If you choose to use a drop address or misspell your name or use a fake name, you are accepting the risks involved and should not fault the vendor if your product does not arrive.&nbsp;

				I usually use my own addy, but , if I have a lot of packages arriving in a particular time frame, it sometimes makes me nervous. Like 8 express packages in a week might start to draw attention so I have used a friends name/addy once or twice for this reason.&nbsp; I&#039;m honest with them about it though and either offer to give them a little of whatever I&#039;m getting or ask if they want to straight up share in the deal and kick in some $$$$ themselves/.

				OP- to actually answer your question without making a joke of it, all true professionals use &#039;drops&#039;. <br /><br />The definition of a Drop is a location in which incoming packages full of cash or illicit items can be sent to, without linking those packages directly to the professional who deals with; or traffics those items or cash.<br /><br />Everyone who is anyone in the game that imports goods from overseas or cross-continent, use Drops to receive such imports.&nbsp; A Drop should only be a person whom you trust with your LIFE.&nbsp; As they will most certainly have it in their hands, should something go wrong(ie; snagged package).&nbsp; Make sure this person is well educated on probable-cause, plausible deniability, and their 5th amendment right.&nbsp; Make sure this person would never snitch.&nbsp; Usually, a drop is paid for their participation by the professional, or an associate of the professional if you(the professional) wish to have an indirect relationship with your Drop. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t a joke, nor something to joke about.&nbsp; Once you lose a LB of weed in the mail that had YOUR name on it, coming to YOUR home address.&nbsp; Your days of being the neighborhood pot dealer are over.<br /><br />Not with a Drop, however, because you were smart... and know the consequences of the game.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re just smoking reefer or getting a couple pills... sending to yourself, at home, whatever.&nbsp; But for all those dealers out there shipping shit to themselves.&nbsp; Fucking stop it!&nbsp; Stop being so silly!<br /><br />&lt;/fin/;<br />

				As I&#039;ve stated in multiple threads, I think it&#039;s fucking stupid to use your real name/address. Giving your details to a bunch of drug dealers??? FUCK THAT.

No addresses, no direct face-to-face contact with the supplier, no handshakes. The system worked.<br /><br />I have a drop setup that I&#039;ve successfully used for legal parcels.

				I think you need to have an agreement with the people having the package shipped to, but as with Tor, it&#039;s always a good idea to distance your actual address from where the shipment first arrives.&nbsp; Making things take a circuitous route just seems to make sense as a cautious approach.
