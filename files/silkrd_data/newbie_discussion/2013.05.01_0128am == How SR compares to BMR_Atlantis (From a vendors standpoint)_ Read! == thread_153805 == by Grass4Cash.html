				I just created a Silkroad vendor account a few weeks back, and I have to say there are a few pros, but more cons compared to BMR. Here&#039;s a honest chart of the 3 largest marketplaces out there:<br /><br />Silkroad: <br />Pros: <br />- Very big userbase=lots of sales fast<br />- Pretty good layout<br />- Easy to withdraw from account<br /><br />Black Market Reloaded:<br />- Great layout (Easy to make listings, adjust etc)<br />- SUPER fast! On SR it can take several minutes to load a single PM on its slower days. On BMR, I have never had to wait more than 30 seconds<br />- Cheap fee&#039;s<br />- More freedom on what to sell (True freemarket)<br /><br />Atlantis:<br />- 2 payment options<br />- Cheap fee&#039;s<br />- More freedom on what to sell<br />- Super fast<br />Major con? Next to no userbase. <br /><br />You can all hate on me for posting this, but the honest truth is that Silkroad is just to slow from a vendors view. The amount of time it would take to read the amount of messages I get on BMR to read on SR would be insane, I wouldn&#039;t even do it. Until DPR invests in more server space, SR is doomed to be going offline very often.<br /><br />BMR compared to SR:<br />&nbsp;My personal favorite is BMR currently, I believe Atlantis has potential, but I am going to wait for them to grow for a while. On BMR, the server is blazing fast and is using less than 1/3 of the server space. Its pretty obvious SR is using a very big chunk of theirs. Fee wise: 2-4% on BMR compared to 10% on SR, much nicer. You also have the freedom to sell whatever wares (Not including CP) you want, while some of you disagree with this, its not truly a freemarket unless you are free to sell what you please. SR has a much bigger audience, which means products sell a lot faster on here. BMR has a reputation of &quot;scam city&quot;, while yes there are scam complaints, that is going to go hand in hand with any anonymous market. The main problem is people FE for obvious scam attempts, the FE syndrome going on at SR needs to stop, escrow is there for a reason. Use it! <br /><br />I will be selling prints and commercial bud+some high grade meth on my SR account here, and I sell some various other wares on BMR (Including firearms full escrow, feedback proving success to AUS+UK :)) <br /><br />Send me a PM there if you have any questions, or wait until SR is back. I cant wait for SR to come back, as I need to mark a few orders as shipped but well... Yeah. <br /><br />Cheers,<br />DF (Demonfifa)/Grass4Cash

				from the buyers stand point...silk road all day.&nbsp; The power is from the community.&nbsp; If there is no community there is no reliability.&nbsp; I guarantee these sites have far more scamming than SR.&nbsp; If someone has a question on SR, they can easily find an answer within this strong community.&nbsp; I also feel like these new places are honey pots...but maybe im just paranoid.&nbsp; ill go crawl back in my hole now

				This post seems to be more from a vendors perspective rather than why the buyers should migrate to these markets. I mean sure they might be faster, but as reliable? <br />As great as a &quot;truly&quot; free market sounds, there are plenty of drawbacks too.

				SR is the best of the three. BMR and Atlantis especially have no userbase. While the fees at the latter 2 may be less than SR, no userbase/buyers means no sales, making the commission difference irrelevant. BMR has items that are not sold on SR (i.e. counterfeit bills) but most are from vendors scamming buyers. The 1 or 2 legit sellers of counterfeit bills sell extremely low quality bills that will not fool anybody.

				BMR has been around for nearly 2 years, and their userbase has grown large recently. Its ~40% the size of SR now and growing, every month Backopy releases the details on the site (new users/btc traded/usd value traded etc), and its catching up quickly, 700k+ in deals last month alone. There are not many scams, if you stay in escrow, you will be safe, there are also plenty of trusted sellers there... I dont understand why people FE for vendors, there is no need to. When I purchase anything, I only will FE for 1 or 2 vendors that I have dealt with several times in the past, its always good to stay in escrow. If your looking to buy guns/ammo/counterfeit bills/stolen goods BMR will have it (Stay in escrow no matter what!). Dont get me wrong, SR is great and all, but from a business standpoint, its much to slow, its inconsistent (I remember that 2 week outage, I decided to not buy an account for a while due to that) and its too restricted for some of my goods. Again, this is just my point of view, but it would be great if people learned to use more than one site and not get attached. These sites are made for business, if a site goes down, it is important that there are other sites available. <br /><br />If anyone decides to check out BMR check out these sellers (I personally vouch for them):<br />TooLegit (I ordered some bud from him, best bud I have received off either the road/bmr period, it was his alien rx4)<br />CashOutInc (Cheapest rates on moneypaks/cashing out period, flat $25 fee on cashing out! (For instance $500 costs you $525 in BTC)<br />CherryFlavor (Almost always has firearms in stock, has successfully shipped 40+ firearms with feedback to prove)<br />Grass4Cash/Demonfifa (Yes, myself :D I have 2 vendor accounts there, one is top 3 active sellers, and the other is gaining feedback on firearm sales)<br /><br />Just dont be close minded about your options, its always a good idea to check out both sites as some have things the others dont have. <br />Also, whats really good about BMR: BMXchange, an exchanger built into the site (Prices on site are shown in bottom right, current MtGox average) but you can buy/sell your BTC in ways you want (IE sell BTC for a moneypak/cash in mail/wire transfer etc), which is important considering that cashing out methods are going to get continually harder as more cashflow is spent on SR/BMR. <br /><br />Again, just my 2cents<br />

				I too wish the 10% commission was lower, but it is what it is. I&#039;d rather have the larger market to work with than pay less % commission, because I have the potential to overall do more business on SR. Taking into account regular business patterns on SR

I was the scammer because he sold crap. Poorly grown, it was laughable. The genetics were outstanding. I even posted pictures, and others reported the same. The dude buys, weed in the same place. You can connect his vendor, and buyer account together. Not my security risk. He got scammed by some vendor who moved to SR, scammed, and got popped in both places. <br />So you are either him, or connected, cause that dude acts like a kid. So this should start the shit rolling. I call, BULLSHIT.<br /><br />BMR does work. They charge the buyer fees, and fees to move BTC. What you get on one end, gets made on the other.<br />The scamming is worse only because the forums don&#039;t have enough supporters that give a shit about more than just themselves. That will come with age.<br />The FE game is big time there. At least Toolegit didn&#039;t require it, but most others do, especially if you are new. Newbies are screwed hard on BMR. So run right over, and FE on your first order. Please report back how that worked, lol.<br /><br />Nice to have options, I&#039;ve tried the others. I&#039;ve had my differences in the beginning here, but all in all, it&#039;s a damn good place. I little down time is nothing.<br /><br /><br />Now please tell me I know nothing about weed, and deserve no respect. No worry, I&#039;m use to it ;)<br /><br />I wrote this high 8) on Jackblue, Christy Nugs, Brutusk, and NW Nugs weed. (yes, I smoked them all) Now those are vendors selling top notch weed. Not shit with trim leaves on it. What a joke that was. <br />

				&nbsp;I believe what you said about Toolegit (I saw that bickerment in the forums), but I tried him out anyways because this strain he was offering sounded to good to pass up on (Alien Rx4), I have pictures of its... Its beautiful, covered in trichomes. I was also very drunk when I smoked it but last I remember it was excellent ;) He did me a few favors by cashing out a bunch of my BTC at cost ($1000 in my BTC for $1000 in his cash) so I favor him a bit for that.

So this should start the shit rolling. I call, BULLSHIT.&quot;, again I am not him. Ive sold 4 firearms (5th is enroute to buyer currently) all successfully including UK and AUS... So say what you want, but I am certainly not a child. This is the saddest part of BMR... The most scammed item on the darknet is firearms and what comes with them (Ammo etc), I dont understand why... The profit margins are killer and really isn&#039;t to difficult if you live in the US to acquire them (Shipping is the tough part). <br /><br /><br />Im glad you enjoy SR more, but from a vendors view the fast speed makes BMR much better. I read/respond 100-120 PMs a day on BMR within 30-60 minutes, on SR that would take days. If SR invested in better infrastructure (Which they should) this site would be 10x better.

				Il ask my friend for the pictures (He took them) because he had never seen such beauties before. 3.5g was split up into perfect size nugs. I found out the other guys name, TheHookUp, I left him a review criticizing him because when I opened the package (I tested him out because he was a new vendor, only way to keep vendors at BMR :P) and it reeked (No outside smell, but if there was even a small hole in the package/box it would be smellable a mile away). He has fixed that since supposedly, however my biggest problem was the actual experience... Instead of tasting cheez its using my taste buds, all I had to do was touch them with my hands. Not what I was expecting but alas :/<br /><br />Once again SR is down...

				I would disagree with the &quot;SR vendors killing the compeition&quot;, very good on both sides... If you order with high feedback members on BMR the service is the same which is what I have found. I have used SR many times as a buyer (55+ transactions, 160+ BTC several months), and same with BMR. On SR I have found your likely to get better service on any given vendor however. <br /><br />Also (quick rant :)), I love how I have negative karma for posting this. Everyone here claims to be &quot;Freedom loving&quot; and part of the &quot;Revolution&quot;, well im sorry to say but many of you are hypocrites. I have seen people on here making blacklists of vendors for selling on other sites besides SR. SR is a service offered by DPR (only advantage is the amount of people here. Really, thats the only thing keeping vendors here, which is why DPR doesn&#039;t invest in fixing it, because he knows that they aren&#039;t going anywhere). In order for this revolution to succeed you need more than 1 site. This site is also not a completely freemarket place, yes, there are more options than allowed in current jursidictions, but firearms among other things are banned. If you truly believed in personal freedoms, you would realize that it is anyones right to possess what they please.<br /><br />

				i have 20 transactions on silk road and all flawless. i have bought two things on bmr and got scammed once (even on a supposed to be free sample the guy took my 10$ lol. what a joker market). What market place i do prefer? is obvious. I wouldnt even buy on bmr anymore if silk road would be down for ever. Atlantis some russian geeks who will run as soon as there is enough money to make it profitable (all speculations but i just cant trust these guys. Russians will do almost anything to get ur money - to me it is also pretty obvious Atlantis is behind those ddos attacks). There is nothing but the sr thing :) And im pretty sure there are at least 5 times as many server running silkroad than bmr and atlantis together. Start a ddos attack on one of those sites with half the power and they will go down just as sr. <br /><br />Also u say silkroads layout is a &#039;Pretty good layout&#039; but bmr is a great layout? This sentence make me think you are political and come right from bmr to try and steal customers. Even the vendors on bmr moan about the &#039;add listing&#039; system. and the only admin (backopy or whatever) who could change that doesnt hear what his customers or vendors say and want. <br /><br />With a few very minor and small changes he could make bmr 500% better but he either thinks what he does is better (it is obviously not) which in my book makes him a dumb and/or ignorant Admin, or is simply to lazy. And i dont want lazy people to take care of my security.<br /><br />The &#039;add listing&#039; here on silk road is by FAR the best u can find in my opinion. To me personally silkroad is the only way to go. I gladly pay a few dollars more for a competent and pretty safe service.<br />

If you order with high feedback members on BMR the service is the same which is what I have found. I have used SR many times as a buyer (55+ transactions, 160+ BTC several months), and same with BMR. On SR I have found your likely to get better service on any given vendor however. <br /><br />Also (quick rant :)), I love how I have negative karma for posting this. Everyone here claims to be &quot;Freedom loving&quot; and part of the &quot;Revolution&quot;, well im sorry to say but many of you are hypocrites. I have seen people on here making blacklists of vendors for selling on other sites besides SR. SR is a service offered by DPR (only advantage is the amount of people here. Really, thats the only thing keeping vendors here, which is why DPR doesn&#039;t invest in fixing it, because he knows that they aren&#039;t going anywhere). In order for this revolution to succeed you need more than 1 site. This site is also not a completely freemarket place, yes, there are more options than allowed in current jursidictions, but firearms among other things are banned. If you truly believed in personal freedoms, you would realize that it is anyones right to possess what they please.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m gonna be pedantic here and point out what I think might be a flaw in your logic. Your logic seems to be that one reason BMR is better is that it is a freer market than the one here. But like you say, it&#039;s not truly free because some items are restricted. Does that mean you think BMR would be improved if it lifted its trade restrictions and became a truly free market?<br /><br />Sometimes people agree to draw lines.

Atlantis feels VERY fishy, although I just can&#039;t put my finger on it. The worst is the Sheep Market, which is an even newer black market, which has a similar layout to Atlantis. The reason I don&#039;t use BMR, is because I hear of a lot more scammers on there. SR has a great community, great vendors, and great buyers. There&#039;s really no reason to change at this point.

				BMR actually has a fairly large user base (100k+ users), the problem is that sales haven&#039;t started to pick up until recently. 700k a month is ~35-40% of SR&#039;s estimated monthly intake. The sale rate on SR is much better, but besides having more users, SR is worse in everywhere. More fees for sellers, less options to sell, and actually the ability to make listings on BMR is much easier than on here, I had to rewrite what I put in 3x on SR.<br /><br />Im just giving people other options. I have tried to log into SR for 30 minutes now and I keep getting bounced out. <br /><br />As for scammers, the only reason people get scammed is because they FE, that is entirely their fault. I dont feel bad for people that get scammed who buy from someone with 0 feedback and than FE the amount to them, its just stupid to do so, thats like sending a WU transfer to someone who says you&#039;ve won the lottery and need to pay them to receive your check! <br /><br />I am all for a freemarket, BMR only bans 2 things: CP and hitmen for hire (Only because to many scammers (all required FE)). Personally, I dont stand for CP at all, but as long as its over the age of 13 and has their consent to do so I dont have a problem with it, as everyone has the right to sell their own body out, own what they please, and ingest what they want. ;) <br /><br />Also for fake IDs... on SR they are $150 for the cheapest. On BMR its $80, same quality. Im not sure what happened, I remember when you could get one on SR for $80-100 bucks but oh well :/<br /><br />Again, Im not saying selling on SR is bad. Infact I want to sell on SR. Except I cant log into the site at least 50% of the time. If I cant see incoming orders/questions and can&#039;t access my funds, than its obviously not the best platform to sell on. <br /><br /><br /><br />
