				Feel free to post this in LucyDrop&#039;s main review page plz. <br /><br />I placed my order for 25 sheet 2/8, was marked in transit on 2/11, and received to East US yesterday, 3/4. I received the correct amount that I ordered and all of that.<br /><br />From what I can tell its likely that I missed the bunk batch but have received the relatively weak batch that everyone&#039;s been reporting, with about half of potency advertised. I&#039;m not experienced enough with LSD to be able to guess at dosage, but I will give a general update once I test in the next couple days.<br /><br />Can anyone tell me what my blotter is called? Its got octagonish shapes on each tab, on a blue background, with a little open eye and kaleidoscopish shapes in the background. Is this the alpha centurai? if not... what?<br /><br />Thanks!

				This would be a little bit more reputable if you had more than 1 post. I realize that sounds hypocritical from me, haha but im not giving anyone credit.

				I´ll abuse this thread, perhaps someone likes to copy this to one or both of the LucyDrop threads.<br /><br />I ordered 25 tabs from LD around the 6. of February and received them last Friday. Took two tabs on Sunday, but they were very very weak. Had one of HollandOnlines Hofmann 3 weeks ago, they were tested with 113µg, so I think I can compare. Even the setting was nearly the same, my flat, shitty weather, an exam in the morning, tabs in the early afternoon.<br /><br />I reclaimed it to LD and he/she offered a full reship. I think the reship is going to arrive and LD isn´t a scammer but a nice guy and good vendor, who had bad luck and/or a little to much orders in the last time.

				the ones i received from LD were very weak basically only paper... unfortunately i tried them way too late after received... so i didn&#039;t bother asking for refund but i don&#039;t think i&#039;ll ever buy from him anymore.

				I got lucky and saw the drama coming on just before I ordered, and went with Tess. Keep in mind this is not McDOnalds and sometimes shit gets messed up. I am not ruling LD out as a future vendor once this mess gets straightened out.

				I think LD and Tesselated are the same, and I wouldn&#039;t buy anything from LD ever again.
