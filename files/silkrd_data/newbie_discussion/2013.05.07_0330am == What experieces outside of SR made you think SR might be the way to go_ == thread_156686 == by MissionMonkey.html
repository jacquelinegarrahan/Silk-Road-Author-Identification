				Here&#039;s my weird experience with the road so far. I&#039;ve never purchased anything on here but I do vend outside of the road using the mail. Been doing so for about 3 years now and so far so good. I&#039;ve had my sketchy situations but ultimately I&#039;m more confident than ever that the mail is the way to go. That being said, in the business I float around in, I meet plenty of oddball characters. One person in particular is a big coke and nos user. A total idiot. BUT I&#039;ve seen him go trough 10 packs of outdoors in a week. Sometimes even more. And he exclusively uses SR. So I figure, if this dumbass can make this work, there has to be something to it. I&#039;ll see what happens to me I guess but my experience as a bi-stander in the real world makes me think this SR thing is legit.

				Doses being sold as doses.&nbsp; Except for everyone in the conversation thought that &quot;doses&quot; meant acid, and it actually turned out to be N-BOMe&#039;s.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; So not cool.&nbsp; And using the terminology that everyone knows and distorting it?&nbsp; Honesty is a very good thing.<br />

				I&#039;ve had similar experiences at festies where doses were absolutely not acid. Such a terrible way to meet people in this world; Confusion and/or dishonesty prompts me to immediately bail on a person.

				Finally joined here after tripping repeatedly with my friend who buys on here.&nbsp; The LSD and DMT were WAY more potent than what I can find on the street.&nbsp; And were actually what they say they are! (LSD not LSA, N-BOMe, etc)&nbsp; So I asked him and he told me about SR.&nbsp; Nothing but amazing experiences from it&nbsp; so fuck yeah!

				first.. getting mugged while buying a bundle of heroin... by the &quot;friends&quot; who were taking me downtown to buy it.<br /><br />second... taking 4 hits of &quot;LSD&quot; that i&#039;m pretty sure wasnt LSD, as there was a crazy rushing noise in my head and it felt like my heart was going to explode.

				The mail is where the smart guys go. Face to face is risky, but as a seller all I have to do is drop it in a mail box with a fake return address. As a buyer I just wait and refuse to sign for anything. <br /><br />Who would not use silk road?
