				Always try to remember to read the forums before posting a question - chances are if you have a question, someone else has had the same question themselves, posted it and already had it answered.<br /><br />Yesterday, I posted on the Forum of my experience with theabsolutefinest, who sells fine cannabis and ALSO will turn your spare cash into BitCoins through any Bank of America. I too started an account on M.G, got verified, then was stymied about how to fund it. As I did my research, I found out that it was more complex than I thought it would be, with possible delays and THEN I read a Forbes article about how BitCoins can be tracked if you use one of the popular wallet systems.<br /><br />So on the advice of a SR vendor, I checked out the Money section on the Road and found that one of the more popular sellers here also sells BitCoins! After contacting theabsolutefinest, I was given deposit information, motored straight down to Bank of America and gave the teller the money to deposit into the specified account. I then had to stop at the grocery, grab a bite to eat and when I was finished, I checked my SilkRoad account and my BitCoins were waiting for me here without having to use any wallet or other ways which could be used by LEOs to easily track me. TAF also gave me a couple of freebies as an incentive to order from them, so I honed in on some of their fine shatter and turned right around and gave them most of their coins back in exchange! Oh, almost forgot - TAF even gave me better than market value for my cash! If they keep THIS up, I&#039;ll probably be using their services exclusively for my BC and cannabis needs.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to their vendor page. Remember to &#039;em tell I sent you. They&#039;ll remember me. ;)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/eb95d4d23f<br /><br />Happily,<br />Screwed

				ya I was thinking that. There must be some kind of seperation or you expect he would be busted in a heart beat, unless this shows that authorities aren&#039;t paying any attention to SR which I doubt

				So it looks like for me localbitcoins.com is worth looking at and also buying the Bitcoins from a seller right here on SR, preferably one that I&#039;m interested in doing business with.&nbsp; It looks like 10% for orders less than&nbsp; $1000 is the fee.&nbsp; &nbsp;theabsolutefinest is a seller who has been mentioned.<br /><br />Does anyone have a case for localbitcoins.com vs. buying from an SR seller who would transfer them right into your SR account ?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks, AW

The problem with buying from vendors on here is it isn&#039;t covered by the resolution center, so when/if the bit coin vendor decides to run off with everybody&#039;s moneypaks or whatever, not much can be done about it. <br /><br />If being absolutely anonymous isn&#039;t one of your chief concerns when buying bitcoins, coinbase has been reliable for me in the past. There is a 4 business day wait for your transaction to finalize to begin with but once you hit level 2 it&#039;s about an hour. <br /><br />Like another poster said, plenty of research can be done to give you enough choices to choose a method right for you. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: buyers guide</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Getting Bitcoins<br /><br />Click here for a list of reputable exchangers that will take many different forms of payment for Bitcoins. When they ask for your receiving address, give them the address on your account page that looks something like this:<br /><br />1hRyhPaynHrWBysLx9yeRHqgTHso2Zcod<br /><br />For user&#039;s making their first deposit and for users that haven&#039;t made a deposit in a while, your account page will have a link that says &quot;Click here to make a deposit&quot;. The page that link leads to is where you will find your SR wallet bitcoin address. After your first deposit your address will be displayed right on the Account page itself, and beside it will be a button that will allow you to generate a new wallet address. We recommend using a new address for each deposit.<br /><br />Please note that, while there are many vendors offering to sell Bitcoins directly from this site, we are not set up to facilitate this and it is very easy to get scammed this way. Until we are set up for it, we recommend you get Bitcoins from a third-party exchange. If you do get scammed we will have no way to help you.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: FAQ</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> How can I get Bitcoins?<br /><br />First see what other users are discussing about the latest methods on the security board of the Silk Road forum.

				If you hook it to a bank account just bounce it around a few wallets before you send it to your SR account? I&#039;m new here but I think that&#039;s the way I&#039;m gonna go about it. That or maybe the moneypak option idk yet. I&#039;m new, still deciding
