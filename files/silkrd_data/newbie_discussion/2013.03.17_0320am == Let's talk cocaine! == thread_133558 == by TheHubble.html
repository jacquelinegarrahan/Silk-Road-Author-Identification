				Why is it all these vendors are selling their c for so much when the purity of cocaine doesn&#039;t seem to be so great? <br /><br />Some of the lab results have shown that people are selling as low as 5% cocaine!! Granted not many of them are that low, it seems there isn&#039;t much feedback on the purity of cocaine other than testing by consumption.<br /><br />Also, I have heard people ripping on U.S vendors for cocaine. Which kind of baffles me tbh because U.S is pretty close to sources like Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. I mean a lot closer than places like Europe and Canada at least. <br /><br />Maybe people are just over good quality c these days...idk. What do you guys think<br /><br />

				Eventually I think rumor mill threads will restore some order to the c markets. There have been some threads recently with people posting lab results from random buys. L used to be a problem but the LSD Avengers gained credibility as a trustworthy source of information and review and things have improved. Then again, L has a whole different crowd than C, so that may affect things.

I had saw the lab tests before and was kind of bummed that they couldnt test the American vendors. Some of them have the best prices and fastest shipping. Wish someone could test NOD, Dragoncove, and 10toes stuff. Been thinkin about getting from dragoncove, but he just recently raised prices and I don&#039;t want to spend 130 on product that people say is good but really could be not all that great.<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s just my stubborn American pride haha, looks like I might just have to try non-u.s vendors.
