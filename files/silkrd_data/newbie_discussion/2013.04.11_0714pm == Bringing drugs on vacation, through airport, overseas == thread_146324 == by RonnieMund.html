				Hey everyone, so I did a quick google search just to see other peoples experience with this but I can&#039;t find shit, and I know it is definitely feasible, because when I flew from Los Angeles to New York last month I had about 4 scripts and a bottle of xanax bars in my carry on back pack.<br /><br />But my question is about overseas and harder drugs. I have a quarter oz of coke coming in tomorrow and I&#039;m leaving for the Bahamas tomorrow night. Does anyone have experience or can give me some insight on if I can bring maybe...an eight ball through the airport, through customs, and get to my resort in the Bahamas?<br /><br />

				Gong to Bahamas you will be fine with small amounts of usual prescription drugs - just keep the in your hand luggage.<br /><br />To be honest if you are having to ask how to get an 8ball through customs however my strong advice would be to just forget it and look forward to your goodies when you get back. The risk you&#039;d be taking would far (FAR) outweigh and benefits.<br /><br />Enjoy your holiday

Last week I traveled through several major US airports carrying Coke, MDMA powder, some E&#039;s, Ketamine, 2C-I, 2C-B and some pre-rolled joints. All was in my small carry on case. The airports I used have finished installing full body scanners in all security lanes so I carried nothing on me.<br /><br />So, I&#039;m still here ordering more drugs, what more can I say? Oh, yes I had a rather enjoyable week&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />They didn&#039;t notice anything. As previously mentioned, unless you have huge amounts taking up large amounts of space you should be fine. As Daft Phader mentioned, just pack sensibly e.g. I put the pills and capsules in my vitamin container etc...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This seems unreasonably risky to me.&nbsp; If you must attempt this, I&#039;d suggest trying to find an extremely inconspicuous place in your carry-on, maybe hidden in some food container or deodorant or something.

But with my drug addict mentality, I want to use it on vacation and bring some other stuff as well. I won&#039;t be going through withdrawals or anything, but I just want some extra fun I guess.<br /><br />I mean I don&#039;t know the process on how they check your carry on luggage. All I see is the bag go through the x ray conveyer belt. You pick it up, get on the plane and your good. But I&#039;m not sure how good the technology is if they can see a small ass bag of coke hidden in a stack of cloths and toiletries and if I had to I would get it vacuum sealed, which I think would prevent any smell detection. For gods sake every time I fly I bring packs of cigarettes and a BIC lighter in my carry on backpack....a fire starter...allowed to be inside a plane cabin....?<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m probably way over thinking it, but that would suck for a bag of coke to ruin a whole vacation before you even get there haha

				Never carried through an airport, however I&#039;ve heard that the TSA often doesn&#039;t give a shit about small assorted drugs. <br />In the end, a baggie of pot isn&#039;t gonna bring down a plane. If anything it&#039;ll make it higher.
