				According to the Federal Criminal Code Act 1995 a drug analogue is:<br /><br />301.9&nbsp; Meaning of drug analogue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1)&nbsp; For the purposes of this Part, a substance is a drug analogue of a listed controlled drug, or a listed border controlled drug, if the substance is any of the following in relation to the listed drug (or in relation to a primary analogue of the listed drug), however the substance is obtained:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; one of the following (a primary analogue):<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i)&nbsp; a stereoisomer;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; a structural isomer having the same constituent groups;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; an alkaloid;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp; a structural modification obtained by the addition of one or more of the following groups:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i)&nbsp; alkoxy, cyclic diether, acyl, acyloxy, monoâ€‘amino or dialkylamino groups with up to 6 carbon atoms in any alkyl residue;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl groups with up to 6 carbon atoms in the group, where the group is attached to oxygen (for example, an ester or an ether group), nitrogen, sulphur or carbon;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; halogen, hydroxy, nitro or amino groups;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp; a structural modification obtained in one or more of the following ways:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i)&nbsp; by the replacement of up to 2 carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring structures with different carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring structures;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii)&nbsp; by the addition of hydrogen atoms to one or more unsaturated bonds;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; by the replacement of one or more of the groups specified in paragraph (b) with another such group or groups;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iv)&nbsp; by the conversion of a carboxyl or an ester group into an amide group;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(d)&nbsp; any other homologue, analogue, chemical derivative or substance substantially similar in chemical structure.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2)&nbsp; However, a drug analogue does not include a substance that is itself a listed controlled drug or a listed border controlled drug.<br /><br />Can someone with more brains than I come up with a list of legal RC&#039;s from this......<br /><br />Cheers

				The only ones I can think of were the various &quot;legal highs&quot; being sold through Adult shops but I believe they have been withdrawn. Think you&#039;ll find most RC&#039;s are caught up under this analogue legislation as it basically bans the controlled drugs and any chemical compounds that are similar. In other words, small changes to the chemical structure of controlled drugs does not render them legal.<br /><br />
