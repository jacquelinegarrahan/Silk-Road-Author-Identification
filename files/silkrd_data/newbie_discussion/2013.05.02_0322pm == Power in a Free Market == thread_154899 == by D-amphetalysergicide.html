				One can never forget how power corrupts absolutely;--that is to say, that once power is acquired, there are natural forces both within and outside the power holder. Lord Acton can account for this, as can any political scientist throughout history. Julius Caesar didn&#039;t have a very nice farewell from his peers in the Senate of Rome.<br /><br />If you walk around the mall brandishing a pistol or wielding a knife, then chances are you will be detained, harassed, arrested, beaten, or killed. These are high probability outcomes. Similarly, if you become rich, through good fortune or hard work, then you face certain hostility and challenges from nature, whether it be bad weather, a suffering economy, or others struggling hungrily for power. Silk Road has gained such power, and it now must fight to survive in the current hostile global market. There are those among us that want to arrest the top sellers, put them in cages because they are successful beyond the realm of the Kingdoms: the United States of America, the EU, the Spanish Americas, Asia, and Africa.<br /><br />The current establishment in America holds the key to untold wealth. Space is upon us, like a bloom upon a spring flower, and it beckons us to fly to the next host planet, one that can support life as much as it can new, free ideas, ideas under the blanket of liberty instead of the chains of tyranny. Intelligence and defense communities, however, restrict access to rockets and space for fear of enemies and terrorists. Newly designed space vehicles are classified and redefined as weapons. Nuclear and high energy nitro-compounds are all tucked away in concrete slabs, behind barbed wire and armed guard--with good reason, given the current climate of terrorism--but that isn&#039;t the worst part. The heart of its security is bureaucracy. Governments and corporations are empowered, and simultaneously enslaved, by the legal and social enterprise that has evolved since the days of barter and basic human survival, culturally and physically. Max Weber wrote extensively on the matter, and there are few people that really engage this phenomena beyond exploitation and self-gain.<br /><br />Until the recent Mars exploration, NASA has not been an effective public service engine since the moon landing. Twice in fifty years... given there are satellites and countless Solar System--our cradle within the Galaxy, a glowing spiral twist of gas and rock--listening and measuring devices. NASA is the most important teaching tool in human history, along with European and Japanese space programs, but it is locked away behind bureaucrats and financial institutions mistakenly labeled higher education. How many billions have gone into the Drug War? when those precious dollars could have been put toward space education and extraterrestrial survival. Microphones, wiretaps, priceless optics, and man hours.... Oh the man hours that have gone to sitting and watching other men. <br /><br />&quot;What&#039;s he doing now?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He just dropped a package. Now he&#039;s leaving, the sick fuck.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What package? Was it the drop? Is that a go? Armed and ready, all systems hot.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No, he just came out of the bathroom, and he didn&#039;t even wash his hands!&quot;<br /><br />NSA, FBI, DEA, IRS--don&#039;t forget the Revenuers--, CIA, DoD, JSOC, Seal Teams--private armies of the Senate... How much time and money do these guys spend to keep America safe. Now, imagine if they spent 10% of their down time and resources on community education.<br /><br />&quot;Hey, you don&#039;t have to lock a cannabis dealer up for 5, 10, 15 years. You can re-educate and re-employ them, and instead of the cost of a cage--up to $45k per annum--they benefit their community and the State.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You mean, we don&#039;t get to lock these guys up? Put them in a cage like the animal they are?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Only if they are murders or rapists, violent types.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s beyond my pay grade. I&#039;m just here for the rush from busts. There are rule-breakers out there, and they deserve what&#039;s coming to them.&quot;<br /><br />This is a big problem with LE intellect. They want justice and vengeance, even if the so-called criminal is harming no one. LEOs are committed to a system of punishment--the more wrong you do (in the eyes of the law: prosecutors, judges, politicians, hostile political rhetoric, for the sake of career building and preservation), then the more pain you deserve.<br /><br />What does an abused child learn? A raped girl or woman? A father of a murdered child? Sometimes, the victims of tragedy--after pain and suffering--respond with understanding, with warm hearts and endless love. This is only some of the time. Other times, an abused child is left with social and physical scars that leave a dark seed of hatred and unconscious pain. Social workers have no political power, yet they serve communities with more love and care than any LEO or politician. Medical personnel have suffered a cataclysmic schism in which the large institutions of medicine--the skill and power over healing and life--are primarily financial institutions and secondarily legal institutions, while health is third or fourth, at best. Smaller institutions generally adopt this approach, but there are good medical practitioners out there--just few and far between...<br /><br />So where does that leave us? Ah, yes, the digital Silk Road, no longer an Asian trade route of guns, money, and drugs--power, in other words. We are arbiters of truth, just as the Bush Dynasty were arbiters of power--Iraq, Saudia Arabia, Afghanistan, Central and South America, etc... We have a responsibility to preserve the freedom to buy, trade, and sell what we choose to, while adhering to nonviolence that rarely prevails in what American leaders deems &quot;peacetime&quot;. Let the Senate&#039;s JSOC and the President&#039;s military fight for preservation of its institutions of wealth and power, pain and suffering, political maneuvering and self-defining truth. <br /><br />We now have our answer to the corrupt institutions, so let new ideas flow freely, and let follow the greatest gesture of peace available to the Road: smoking a joint and start enjoying life, instead of trying so hard to destroy it in the name of honor and integrity; violence is as natural as philanthropy, and like violence, philanthropy begets philanthropy.

				To Eminem:<br /><br />It&#039;s time to pay for the spray that you let loose on the mother fuckers that choose to stay,<br /><br />Playing the game that you never played, but only prayed about,<br /><br />Empty dreams that got you rich by CDs--a Middle East import.<br /><br />You went from drinking malt liquor to the finest port,<br /><br />And you lyrics turned into a fermented past, when you tried to foment a van guard of ghosts,<br /><br />So any style that you had is gone in the wind like the world of sin,<br /><br />A day to day change from ketamine to heroin,<br /><br />At last, a drug that works to get the words out of our heads,<br /><br />Until we grow old and free, living fast and never stopping until we dead.<br /><br />The fight for the top has just begun, and you&#039;re an old man, rich and lazy,<br /><br />Because the battles began with the first tools used to murder--twine, sticks, and stones.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is that your as useless as the words you used,<br /><br />As the strawmen that you abused in your words of song,<br /><br />Oh how you got that shit so fucking wrong, see.<br /><br />Your money, your influence? It comes from the dumb mother fuckers that tempt you, pussy,<br /><br />Like a child holding a bone in front of a pitbull, teasing the beast,<br /><br />So don&#039;t expect us to have decency for an 8 mile reject that could have at least<br /><br />Been as real as have the words for which you never fought,<br /><br />As empty as a bag of chips off the shelf--full of air and empty calories--<br /><br />And there&#039;s no help to be found, not even from the poison smoke from your seedless sensimilla trees.<br /><br />You know your nigga 50? His lyrics turned, like the old smoke the room: fucking hazy.<br /><br />G-Unit is old news, dawg, like hurricane Katrina,<br /><br />Too late to save and too poor for whites to help, like it&#039;s straight up Kenya.<br /><br />Weather tries to take your life away, Nola,<br /><br />And you lose lives like gangstas stole &#039;em,<br /><br />Like your whip that got got by five oh when you had the kees of MDM.<br /><br />That&#039;s the MGM of the mind, complete and replete with life without pain,<br /><br />Except the authorities don&#039;t give a fuck about life in the streets, inexorable adversity.<br /><br />God won&#039;t stop bullets or bars from coming your way,<br /><br />Because honest men still rot in a cage when bad ass niggas kill hundreds every hour of any given day.<br /><br />Billions of people on the planet and they got nothing to do but send people to the can,<br /><br />That&#039;s all the can do because their slaves to the man,<br /><br />Whether there&#039;s any god or not, I don&#039;t give a fuck.<br /><br />Tupac got rich long after the Game in streets,<br /><br />Now it&#039;s up to the Cartel, the Spanish, who have been beaten for too long,<br /><br />Ever since Columbus visited the Isle of the Indies<br /><br />And delivered the deadliest weapon in history: an unprecedented biological dialogue<br /><br />Of Death and Disease, like the one Congress is spewing with the greatest of ease.

				An eloquent and educated musing.&nbsp; I would guess a strong political science/sociology background.<br />This reply is in no means meant as a rebuttal to your ideas simply another perspective to view some of them from.<br />While I try my best to avoid delving into politics and the psychology of power it would seem apparent to me that, from an<br />evolutionary stand point, the ideology that embraces forcing their beliefs and systems onto others has a distinct advantage <br />over those which do not.&nbsp; Education is the only possible solution I can see however even this is difficult, as to force <br />education upon the masses would be to adopt the ideology you despise.<br />In regards to NASA, space travel and new technologies I believe the power structure ( we&#039;ll use the US as an example )<br />are usually well behind the eight ball.&nbsp; While they do have significant control over the funding structure, the nature of modern <br />scientific research and the strength of the scientific community mean they tend to become pawns, pushed around by their easily <br />predictable need to control things.&nbsp; Take nuclear fission.&nbsp; Most of the pure science had been completed before the power structure <br />became aware.&nbsp; It was only after specific warnings of the threat that Germany might acquire the technology first (a simple <br />psychological ploy) that they took any notice.&nbsp; At this point a lot of the scientists stepped back in horror as the engineers of <br />the Manhattan Project took over with the well known consequences.&nbsp; I view NASA&nbsp; in a similar light to the Manhattan project.&nbsp; <br />They are simply engineers, directed by the government, who attempt to exploit the current scientific knowledge.;&nbsp; They are unable<br />to develop new theories on their own.&nbsp; As space travel to the new host planets that you suggest requires a massive advance <br />in scientific knowledge, not just further technological development of current theories, it is most likely to come from somewhere <br />such as CERN&#039;s large hadron collider.&nbsp; Surprisingly (or possibly not so surprising) the US provides no funding for this project.&nbsp; If <br />the required knowledge does become available then, as described above the US and it&#039;s proxy NASA will be forced to develop it to <br />it&#039;s full extent in order to maintain &#039;control&#039; of it and preventing the enemy (now most likely China) from getting it first.<br />I feel this is beginning to sound like a rant so i will end here.&nbsp; I would be keen to further this discussion and hear more of your views <br />so please keep posting.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Let -50 be the Boston Marathon. Let 12 be a healthy new born baby.<br /><br />These are estimates for how &quot;good&quot; something is. <br /><br />So let&#039;s consider negatives.<br /><br />It took a lot more energy to plot against America and learn how to make (and test in Russia/Chechnya--Remember Mitt Romney saying RUSSIA was one of our greatest enemies? ? ? ? ?) pressure cooker bombs and willingly take American lives at the expense of their own. Entropy, nothing more.<br /><br />Chaos at its finest hour, and Boston responded with such intense order and discipline, losing fewer lives and preventing extended periods of disorder. This is the new thermodynamic minimum: trained and educated response personnel. These are physical requirements of a developed nation in order to preserve safety and security. How much does it cost? As much as we are willing to spend... whatever it costs to stay safe. Remember that the human mind is the most efficient tool to implement effective security. DPR is performing the same tasks to preserve the Silk Road against digital terrorists and criminal underworlds--the Cartels who stand to lose tremendous amounts of money from this new monopoly of drug distribution--the Banks who stand to lose financial resources due to their inability to protect their clients from corporate tyranny and economic slavery--the Government that usurps power from free markets and leeches energy from private success and private property......<br /><br />This is the Post 9/11 world, where corporate and government interests are so intertwined, that there is no separation between Military and Industry, just as there is no separation from Church and State--other than a public courtesy to make claims to the contrary. Such public lies are regularly conducted and tolerated by governments from all nations. After all, a person is not a government, but a public servant. So how can they be responsible for their actions if their actions were by the people, for the people, and to the people?<br /><br />The positives in this physio-numerical description, like the aforementioned newborn, are just as far reaching as the negatives.<br /><br />A newborn child, that is welcomed into this world--not parasitic abortions, or abandoned (foster care) children that are likely to live a life of crime and entropy--creates so much happiness and extends its family&#039;s love into its own world. The child grows to be a boy or girl, man or woman, and if otherwise healthy, will create so much wealth in the world--material and immaterial, physical and emotional, health and love.<br /><br />This is where we take a turn for the worst, however. Positive things: promotions, career advancements, vacation, health, retirement. So many of these things are generated from negatives. A promotion is sought after, so much so that people lie and cheat and steal in order to gain promotions. If people feel they deserve more, then they may seek private gains, outside of their career. If their career is law enforcement or government, then they have access to resources to which no other civilian has easy access. Career advancements for prosecutors means that you must be punished whether you are innocent or not, and if you are busy living a very private life, then it may be hard to convince a judge you are innocent and harmless. <br /><br />Vacation, health, and retirement--this trinity of developed societies are parasites--much like religions--to a productive, organized society. They are the epitome of selfishness and laziness. Look how much money is wasted on them, collectively, and the cost will far exceed any single defense budget or any single charity. This is a vast economic concern, as well, leading us to insurance, money theory, thermodynamic economics (therm-econ), and governance.<br /><br />If anything, history should have taught us that social evolution is a dangerous and lengthy progress. Writing has been around as long as 10,000 years. Democracy has cropped up here and there for just as long, but democracy and liberty are always out of reach. That&#039;s what evolution is about: an idea or physical state of perfection. The United States gave the world the first ordered democracy of such a vast magnitude, and now Europe is sculpting a better society through public participation and education. Ironically, America is falling into thermodynamic darkness, as the world moves on. The Philippines is a very dangerous place--everyone has a gun--but it is the stepping stone farther on the path away from gun control. Africa, too, faces the harsh reality of gun freedom: gun madness....<br /><br />There is so much to say, that my thoughts are crowding each other. Best I leave it to thought a little while longer before trudging on down this thicket of madness.
