				Hello and welcome!&nbsp; While I&#039;ve been reading around the forums as a guest for quite awhile, today was the day I chose to finally register. I am twice your age but loved that you used the word &quot;fuzz&quot; for the &quot;po po&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I came to the &#039;Road&#039; after a health diagnosis that could be benefited by Ms Mary Jane. It is illegal in my state so I am thrilled to replace the poisonous pharmeceutical meds that the doctors push with the lovely organics of the Emerald Triangle and beyond. I have been tempted by some other drugs like opiates and coke but, alas, know myself well enough to &quot;Just say, no!&quot; 8)

I&#039;ve been a controlled user for over 30 years now. Have you read anything about codependency?&nbsp; I found that the theories behind the treatment for that are without shame and extremely helpful. Hell, it&#039;s what allows me to be controlled! My Mom doesn&#039;t understand how I can do it and I believe it is the depth of spiritual (not religious) understanding that codependency treatment brings.&nbsp; I always said (in regards to the addictions in my family) that the buck stopped here. You are still young, Captain, there is hope for you. See you around the forums and best of luck!
