				Hi,<br /><br />I think it would be a nice idea if the Moderator created ONE stickied &quot;50 Post&quot;-type thread, where everyone could post to get 50 posts if that&#039;s all they are looking to do, instead of half the threads in the Newbie section being &quot;50 Post&quot;-type threads.&nbsp; With ONE stickied &quot;50-Post&quot;-type thread, any new ones created could be deleted by the Moderator.<br /><br />I think the Newbie section is a great place for those Noob questions that would probably just annoy you in other thread categories.&nbsp; But having half the Newbie section be &quot;50-Post&quot;-type threads just seems to clutter it all up.<br /><br />Anyway, just my 2cents.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Mods chime in?<br /><br />Cheers.

				Both the response above mine and my response are really nothing other than glorified &quot;I&#039;m pretending I&#039;m not doing the post to 50&quot; thing while actually doing the post to 50 thing.<br /><br />Any newbie that&#039;s been here long enough to want to be in the other forums knows how to roll their eyes at the post to 50 and is hoping to get the hell out of here as quickly as possible while trying not to look like s/he is spamming to 50.

				We have tried this. The fundemental flaw of this is the whole &quot;THERE HAS BEEN A NEW POST SO FUCK YOUR POST&quot; feature of the simplemachines forum software which I can&#039;t figure out how to turn off. I doubt you can.<br /><br />If there are two noobies on at once trying to use the same thread or even more it is impossible.
