				Hey Guys, New to silk road would like the chance to get some good reviews, Ive added my vendor page, since you all seem to be experienced in SR, please feel free to let me know what you think. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e292c918c4<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for ideas on the most sought after strains.&nbsp; (Please) no lengthy reviews - Just post it, Ill check it out and then start trying to provide them.<br /><br />Ive read some past reviews and I will be getting some green crack seeds soon, my preference is still AK, and White Window (I&#039;m nostalgic what can I say). But let me know if there is a top strain that you just cant say no too.

				Your listings don&#039;t specify the amounts of weed for sale. Or am I missing something? (ÅŒ_o) <br /><br /><br />Regardless, my perfect strain would be Laughing Buddha (Barney&#039;s farm).

				Thanks for the reply, I&#039;ll check it out. As for the listings, I have it listed as 1Unit being available then, in the notes i have one pound. I&#039;m open to other arrangements, but like I said its not a career, not super interested in parting out little bits. More like Costco less like 7-11 :)

				Liberty Haze is a good one. Look for Cannabis Cup winners, and the best picks from Barney&#039;s and Sensi.

				Yes!&nbsp; Big fan of the Haze family, thanks for the suggestion, I&#039;ll add it to the list. I still still have some silver haze hanging around, a very nice sativa based strain.

				If I were you, I&#039;d want the listed strains to be a highlight reel. Sour D, Jack Herer, Blue Dream, OG Kush, but also some more expensive boutique strains like Dr Grinspoon.

				Trainwreck<br />Strawberry Cough<br />GDP<br />Super Lemon Haze<br />Cherry Pie <br />Green Crack <br />Jack Herer <br />all these are good options for you too because I have not seen them on the road yet.&nbsp;
