				A newbie so I posted this review here. Jerseycow microdots are as described around 125 mics clean beautiful LSD. Only ate two to get a feel for them. So didn&#039;t get tooooo far. But was good stuff. Played it safe this time as we were also entertaining guests. But next time ill eat four and should be a solid 500 mics. A decent dose for me anyways.......

				Why would you take that much LSD the day after tripping? That&#039;s seriously just a waste of some of the finest hallucinogens the world has ever known. LSD tolerance builds very very quickly, but also resets very quickly. Wait a week or two between trips for your receptors to reset and you&#039;ll exploit the chemical to its fullest potential.

My &quot;reset&quot; takes about 3 days. I&#039;ve taken 2 tabs&nbsp; ,waited 3 days and still tripped hard on just one of the same tabs. <br />I&#039;ve eaten a ton of acid over this summer...and the trips only got better. I have &quot;acid vision&quot; for weeks after tripping as well. Every body is different.<br />But my rapid rebound is also due to my rigid yoga and running regimen. I actually had a much more intense trip the next day, so I don&#039;t think I wasted any acid, but I&#039;ll try to wait abit longer next time,like you said.&nbsp; These dots are <br />really awesome, get &#039;em while they are around!

But I was also smoking alot of rollies and hit the bong a few times.<br />So that likely was most of the culprit. But I also think some of that tension came from my endless laughing and breathing deeply when I walking with my <br />friends in the trails back where I live. The tension did not detract much from the trip. Stretching also helped. So I think this acid is very clean. Also,<br />to who ever asked NO HANGOVER NEXT DAY, IN FACT I FELT REFRESHED, BLISSED OUT ALL DAY,TOTALLY RELAXED

				I wanted to post a positive review of JerseyCow.&nbsp; I have sang his praises on other threads but it appears this thread is the one I need to post on.&nbsp; Seamless deal across the Atlantic for his sweet little microdots.&nbsp; I&#039;d always heard about microdots but had never seen one.&nbsp; Yes. I also placed a domestic order from chroot, who claimed that he was reselling JerseyCow&#039;s blotter.&nbsp; Did not disappoint.&nbsp; Thank you Jersey Cow.
