				So I just placed a few orders for LSD, weed wax, shake/trim, and 2 diff orders of MDMA.&nbsp; Now Im on to the next.&nbsp; But this next purchase I want to make (which prob wont be done for another week or so) is on something I never really discussed with anyone nor have I really read upon here on the forums, and thats DMT.<br />Would anyone be kind enough to share how much of a dose you started off with? The mins and max and experiences?&nbsp; This drug has been on my list for a while, and now that ive tripped off shrooms, lucy, k, 2ci, 2cb, 2cd I would like to move on to the next drug.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; Thanks everyone!

				i think a good dose for dmt was 30-50 mg for me, i like a better dmt experiance then a weak one but for dmt its really important to smoke it right because it can be easily wasted, i cant even count the times ive seen friends not getting a hit cuz they waste it, dmt is a good personal drug most people cant appriciate it because it only last for a little bit, but its definitly an experiance, maked me question everything about our existance and all that

				Good post by airblaster.<br /><br />You need to vape it.. its hard to smoke it in a bowl with pot, correctly anyway. Either a meth bowl, or any kind of good vape.. <br /><br />30-50mg is about right for the a bowl.. basically you can put as much as you want in a bowl, cause you will literally only be able to take so many hits before your body just wont want it anymore...then blasssstt...hyperspace.<br /><br />&nbsp;DMT is , as i always say, the final frontier for psychedelics

				hey,<br /><br />yes... finding the best way to handle this thing may not be easy, especially if you don&#039;t have any experience with the tools.<br /><br />if you have good hands though, you can build the machine. C: there are plenty of tutorials how to do that, and i also believe there are a few videos on how to use it.

				All my experiences with DMT have been smoke through a bong, but I wasn&#039;t smoking crystal DMT it was the bark like substance I think its called changer or something. I am pretty sure here in Australia our bongs are different to the rest of the world.

				Get a meth pipe, and a torch lighter.&nbsp; Hold below the pipe without touching flame to it.&nbsp; The DMT will start to turn into liquid, then into vapor.&nbsp; SLOWLY but continually hit the pipe at a constant rate.&nbsp; And do that 2-3 times, each time holding it in as long as you can.&nbsp; Make sure someone is with you to take the pipe away from you, because if you do end up blasting, you&#039;ll most likely drop the pipe, burn yourself or cause damage to your surroundings.&nbsp; If you want to fully experience DMT, not just &quot;trip&quot;, put 100-150mg in the pipe.&nbsp; It&#039;s easier to not smoke enough with it there, than to not put enough in the pipe and waist an experience.&nbsp; And you&#039;re not buying DMT just to &quot;set your foot into the door&quot;, so just do as much as you want.

				I will be trying DMT for the first time in the near future as well. Tryptamines is probably the only class of drugs I have not experienced. As it has been said, get a meth pipe or a vaporizer. <br />Here is a link to a pipe suitable for this purpose and costs very little:<br /><br />CLEARNET: http://www.grasscity.com/eu_en/review/product/list/id/4610/

				I&#039;ve never had a true breakthrough experience on DMT myself, but I can tell you about the time I held my friend for 5-10 minutes as he blasted off.&nbsp; He packed the bottom of my bubbler with a little bit of weed and then sprinkled the DMT over it so the DMT wouldn&#039;t fall through the pipe.&nbsp; He used around 200 mg, something I would never do for my first time, but he was somewhat experienced with it.&nbsp; We knew it was better to vaporize it, but drawing in the flame over the bowl still worked wonders.&nbsp; He took three huge slow hits that lasted 15-20 sec and kept taking smaller hits until I took it away, but I could tell he was somewhere else halfway through his second hit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think he even remembered what he was doing with the bowl after the 3rd hit.&nbsp; Definitely have someone there with you, because you will drop the bowl and you might even fall over; I had to hold him and we leaned against a tree because we were in the middle of the woods and he didn&#039;t want to lie down on the ground.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how long he was gone for, but it couldn&#039;t have been longer than 10 minutes.&nbsp; When he came back, he told me he had just spent three days at this huge party with everyone else in the entire world.&nbsp; I can&#039;t possibly do justice to how it must have felt for him, but suffice to say he told me it was one of the most amazing things he&#039;d ever experienced.<br /><br />If you do manage to fully break through - not just trip but truly break through - congratulations! Enjoy the next 5-10 minutes of eternity as your mind deconstructs reality into the wonders of your deepest imaginations.

				DMT can be quite tricky to vaporize correctly. I&#039;ve consistently broken through with 20-40 mg using the glass vapor genie (a glass vaporizer, you can look up online for it). It is quite expensive and it takes some effort to set it up and learn how to use it properly, but once you&#039;ve mastered it you are almost guaranteed breakthroughs all the time.<br /><br />Also, I suggest you visit this webpage: dmt-nexus.me. I found it has the most comprehensive information on DMT, and a very lively forum.<br /><br />Enjoy exploring hyperspace, but treat it with utmost respect, since DMT is not a recreational drug and you may also find things that are not as nice...

				when it comes to DMT smoking, it&#039;s all about purity of the product. i see so many pictures on SR with almost orange (and no, its not changa alkaline in there) stuff. <br /><br />if extracted DMT from mimosa or elsewhere is tan, yellow or orange, that means that there a still plantmaterials (tannis, oils and n,n-DMT oxide, which is already degrading until its a yellow goo) in there and nope, thats no a special form of DMT, its dirt. if you see dirty DMT, you can assume that the extractor didnt do a wash (forget ammonia, use sodium carbonate) and he definitly did not a hot-bath recrystallization.<br /><br />if you heat this yellow stuff in highgrade distilled petroleum ether (naptha, everclear or something less crude from a pharmacy), the solution will under temperature turn clear but yellowish (like piss) and on the bottom of the glass a yellow goo will form. that&#039;s the oils and plantmaterials along with leftover sodium hydroxide from the extraction. these are the reason for harsh smoke that burn your lungs and kill your smoking experience. get rid of them with carefully sucking off all the yellowish clear solution on top of the oillayer and place it in a new glass jar (like a shotglass), cover it with plastic wrap and put it into a dark room for one night. in the morning you will have beautifully GLASS shards and white flowers of DMT crystals.<br /><br />people usually dont give a shit doing one or 2 recrystallization because you obviously loose netweight by getting the junk out. but trust me... its TOTALLY worth it.<br /><br />here is the process in pictures:&nbsp; https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=1266<br />and this is the divice you should use when smoking DMT: wiki.dmt-nexus.me/The_Machine<br /><br />if you have crude (yellow, orange, brown, tan) material you can still plug it or use a MAOI and do a pharmahuasca session.<br /><br />smoking 40-50mg will do if you can get everything down with 2-3 hits without coughing and holing it in long enough.<br /><br />plugging is a bit labile, there is no real dosage rule, you gotta try it yourself, but start low. plugging surpases the MAOI metabolism, so you dont need to swallow a maoi to get DMT active. i&#039;d start with 30mg and make your way up.<br /><br />oral with MAOI requires more prepeation (physically) imho, because unless you have an isolate Harmine or the MAOI as pharmaceutical pill llke Moclobemide, you&#039;ll be bound to syrian rue seeds or a caapi tea, which will most likely induce nausea and vomiting. under ritualistic circumstances you can put it as &quot;part of the journey&quot;, so you might want to eat rice the days up your ayahuasca trip and not quite thai curry or spicy pepper sauces.<br />dosages for oral depend on body weight, but a good average is around 100mg and 150mg harmine isolate (or 2-3g syrian rue seeds)<br /><br />

				I think if you dont have scales to weigh up each hit just try and go for the match head visual, some crystal is more dense and some more flakes and grains but about 2 match heads worth should be enough or just 1 match head for a light smoke(equal to 0.1g). Torch lighters come in handy, DMT can be smoked in bong, pipe or joint but needs some herb material to carry it. Smoking pure freebase works in a glass vaporizer but I prefer to flame it up. If smokin a cone or bowl put the herb in the bottom and crystal on top, I like to put the lighter on the bowl and heat the DMT for a few seconds before starting to puff away. You will see the stuff melt and then catch alight with the herb, sometimes it can put off a bit of a flame but keep toking. The idea is to blaze it as hot as possible take in as much, as deep as you can and hold. Results come on fast, if you want to go as far as possible follow up instantly with second and if necessary third toke.(so you will need a really big bowl for a full 3 tokes or pack a few single hits). I like to have a pre rolled DMT joint ready for after the bong or pipe which is simple to use and can make the experience last a bit longer and also easy to share. I found that if you try a smoke and it was not enough unlikely you will get a positive result by smoking more and I wait until another day to try again, it is like you only go as far as what you ingest in the first toke and immediate tokes after that. I reckon the herbs can effect the trip and find the results differ when smoked with pot or tabaco to damiana. You want a material that is easy on the lungs and doesnt make you cough.

				I grabbed this from another site. Hope it helps. It&#039;s got more than just dosing, and I thought it was pretty good as far as instructions go...<br /><br />1) The Freebase Method:<br />Obtain a &quot;freebase&quot; airpipe. Use with the largest funnel type bowl you can find. Insert the largest fine mesh stainless steel screen that will fit into the bowl. Then sprinkle the DMT uniformly over the center of the mesh screen. Make sure to keep thE DMT away from the edges of the screen so that when it melts it does not run over the edge of the screen. Hold a match or torch above the screen and inhale deeply and slowly. Do not let the flame touch the DMT as this will destroy much of the drug. DMT melts and vaporizes easily so the point is to let the hot air rushing by the flame into the pipe vaporize the DMT. It is quite easy to vaporize the DMT and end up with the airchamber full of white DMT vapor.<br /><br />The Classic Psychedelic Ranger Method:<br />Load the DMT into the glass reaction chamber and heat the outside bottom of the chamber with a flame.<br />When the white vapor appears, breathe in deeply and slowly. If you inhale too soon or too quickly, the powdered DMT will be blown down your throat. It is not active that way. Make sure that all of the DMT is vaporized. In the absence of a classic DMT pipe, some people use a regular &quot;hash oil&quot; pipe heated from the outside. We find this too tricky to be reliable. You are just as likely to end up with boiling liquid DMT in your mouth. (That&#039;s why the classic pipe has a &quot;V&quot; shaped stem.) Freebasing is the preferred method by most.<br /><br />In either case...<br /><br />The smoke is very harsh. It tastes like burning plastic. It isn&#039;t particularly hot, but you will have a tendency to cough. On each toke try to hold your breath for as long as possible. Exhale and immediately take a second toke. The physical effects, a buzzing or vibration throughout your whole body, come on first. The intensity of these effects is not a reliable guide to the dosage of DMT that you have consumed. Keep taking lungfuls and holding them until all of the premeasured DMT is consumed. Gracie suggests that the best way to smoke DMT is to try to smoke as much as you can before you inevitablly fall into a trance. While not recommended for beginners, it does capture the approach you should take towards smoking your premeasured dose.<br /><br />One advantage of the &quot;freebase&quot; method is that the 50mg of DMT can be divided into three toke sized piles. The smaller amount can be easily vaporized and inhaled in one breath with the screen being reloaded with DMT after each toke.<br /><br />Just as you feel yourself &quot;going over the top&quot;, exhale. Breathe normally, close your eyes and enjoy the visions.<br /><br />Your companions should be instructed to take the pipe from you when you close your eyes because you will have poor motor control. Since you will be in a trance for 4-8 minutes, you should also have told them not to disturb you. To them you will look like you are asleep. This is not a social drug or one to be taken casually; you will be entranced.<br /><br />When you come our of the trance, remain seated for about 10 more minutes as you will still have only shaky control of your limbs.<br /><br />In 30 minutes from the time you started you will be pretty much down, but still euphoric. You will be completely down after a total of about one hour.<br /><br />We do not recommend that DMT be combined with other drugs. It should be done on a clean head. Marijuana fogs the effects. It is not a party drug: the effects are most entertaining experienced in a quiet room. When DMT is smoked at the peak of a mushroom or LSD trip, the effects are spectacular, but only recsmmended for the experienced, most brave (or some might say, most foolhardy) of investigators. The effects used at the peak of another psychedelic can last for several hours.<br /><br />

				If you follow these instructions, you may be able to avoid plugging the DMT, which I think might be a good idea since there isn&#039;t really a good dosage calculator for that (at least that I have found). Also, electronic gram scales can be purchased pretty inexpensively. Probably a good investment since eyeballing can be a total fail for most of us.
