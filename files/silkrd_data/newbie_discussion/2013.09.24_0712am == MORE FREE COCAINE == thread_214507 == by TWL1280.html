				I added a few more free cocaine samples. This stuff was done in Germany. It is flaky and oily and you don&#039;t know what cocaine is, until you have seen mine.<br /><br />Buy the free sample now. We are running out - get them while they are hot.<br /><br />But one thing more: buy my 1g - testing listing today - full escrow. I say it is the best coke you ever had. <br />Buy the item &quot;Ultra Pure Cocaine | MADE IN GERMANY test it! 1g&quot;. d.<br /><br />The &quot;test it!&quot; after Germany is important. Cuz I&#039;m so sure of myself. I&#039;m sure I have the best coke out there. If you don&#039;t like it, I give you 50% back. No questions aske<br /><br />`thanks, I forgot the link;<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/366529fdc9

				just searched for TWL1280 on the main site and it&#039;s come up with zero results :-\ you&#039;re not making it easy for your potential customers to find you!<br /><br />the search bar will only take &quot;Ultra Pure Cocaine | MADE IN GE&quot; before it runs out of space, which comes up with zero results as well

				another tip for you - if you want access to the vendors roundtable your forum name needs to be the same as your SR name, and you need a link to your vendor page in your signature :)

				I don&#039;t risk ordering from overseas... Also how is this free? You specifically say on your vendor page you don&#039;t do free samples. Just a heads up to the newbies: this vendor is paying more reputable forum members to post ads for them. Not a big deal, but still something to consider...<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=214477.0<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=214476.0

				Dear gn0ssos,<br /><br />I gave out a lot of free 0.5g Cocaine samples. Obviously, the number was limited and was sold out within on hour.<br /><br />And yes, I paid another member to post for me in the vendor forum. You can think of that what you want, but I am trying to market and to draw attention as good as I can.<br /><br />We used to have an &quot;offline-market&quot;, which we gave up. Thus, I try to accelerate things on SR.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />TheWhiteLady<br /><br />https://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/silkroad/user/366529fdc9

				I perfectly understand you. It seems a bit &quot;fishy&quot;.<br /><br />However, I was notified that the first orders arrived and I&#039;m hoping for some good reviews.<br /><br />Perhaps I was a bit inpatient. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/366529fdc9
