				Hello friends,<br /><br />I recently made my first purchase (like 4 hours ago) , and as I tell my friend that I am splitting the goods with that I have finally placed the order, he tells me he was just forced to take a drug test.<br /><br />Long story short, i had just confirmed the buy under his address. I promptly messaged my vendor letting him know that something &quot;dire&quot; has happened, and sent a new message with my address.<br /><br />My question is: What are the chances that it still sends to the original address? It says that the vendor has not read my messages and the product is not marked in-transit, so I am hopeful. Is there anything else I can do? Is it all in the vendor&#039;s hands now?

				Message the vendor once or twice, put EMERGENCY or something similar in the subject to get their attention, they likely will be able to accommodate you.&nbsp; I trust most vendors to do the right thing, and be responsive to client needs, so I don&#039;t see why you would have any problems.<br /><br />But I wouldn&#039;t anticipate any problem even if it was delivered to your friend&#039;s place.&nbsp; Just don&#039;t open it for a while (like a day or 2) just in case it&#039;s hot, and as always be aware of your surroundings.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t say getting something shipped there is a nail in the coffin or anything so grim.&nbsp; But I&#039;m an optimist, good things keep happening so why not ? :D<br /><br />

Only problem is that I forgot to put a subject line :/ . However this vendor I bought from has had great reviews regarding customer service so I, too, am hoping for the best, and I guess thats all I really can do

				I think they will check for anything as far as messages from the buyer are conerned before they mark the item &#039;shipped&#039; so you should be fine as long as you&#039;re clear in what you&#039;re asking.&nbsp; Give the vendor time to reply, remember the road is down right now and usually it takes a few hours at least to get a reply...<br /><br />But seriously I doubt that anything would happen if it was sent to your friend&#039;s house unless there&#039;s parentals or others filling the same role there...&nbsp; Unless it just is a giant box from Jamaica or somewhere that reeks of weed lol
