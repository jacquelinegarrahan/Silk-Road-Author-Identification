				Well it seems like a retard question but really.... If lea doesn&#039;t like Sr, and knows its clearly only used for one purpose, what is stopping them from just simply deleting/ shutting it down? Isn&#039;t their some fat rich fuck out there that could just say &quot; Yea go ahaid and delete it&quot; ?

				They don&#039;t &quot;crack&quot; ToR because it is the Government itself that funds ToR (there was even a post sometime ago explaining this).<br /><br />They did know much too well that ToR could be used for illegal activities but the anonymity it guarantee far outweighs these little drawbacks in comparison.

				Because it&#039;s servers are on TOR which is by definition not traceable. The police cannot close down SR but there are ways in which it can damage or slow down the site:<br /><br />1. They can perform ddos attack.<br />2. They can try and ban the medium in which people purchase products (bitcoins, but this is difficult because in order to ban bitcoins they would need coorperation of every single country in the world which won&#039;t happen)-<br />3. They can legalise all drugs.<br /><br />Personally I would like the third one&nbsp; ;D

				Well...the government wants to have their cake and eat it too...which is quite a trick...but when you think you are all-powefrul you tend to think that way...<br /><br />The government originally set up Tor as a way to encourage subversive activities in &quot;unfriendly&quot; countries...like Iran and China...that way they can prop up anti-government activists in that country and enable them to communicate in online communities...without the host government being able to shut them down...like they can with facebook and google etc...<br /><br />Of course the same tool that let&#039;s people in Iran and China do things that their government doesn&#039;t want them to do...well the same is true for folks in the US and the rest of the so-called &quot;free&quot; world...what&#039;s sauce for the goose...is sauce for the gander...

				I cannot see why the front line of LEA&#039;s would want to shut down SR. They know they cannot win the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. No SR or other such sites would drive a large of amount of people back onto the streets in search of drugs and ultimately this is where so much of the &quot;war&quot; is being fought. <br /><br />I know a customs officer who buys her weed on here, I shit you not. Loads of them are at it. We have people on the inside, we&#039;ll be fine&nbsp; ;)

				First off, some fat rich fuck can&#039;t do whatever he wants. Money can buy a lot of things, but it doesn&#039;t give you the kill switch on anything and everything.<br /><br />To answer the original question, SR is far to distributed for LE to make a legitimate effort to shut down. LE is good at busting cartels who are moving millions of dollars in cash and drugs. SR is mostly made up of people buying/selling amounts in $500 or less. Tor helps to anonymize who you are due to the distributed nature. It isn&#039;t perfect (unless you&#039;re EXTREMELY careful and actually know the individual you are communicating with), but it is so easy to set up a good enough tor connection that it isn&#039;t worth LE&#039;s time to track you down. Conceivably, I believe that they could take down SR or make it impractical to use. However, the expertise and time it would take to do this would far outweigh the time and effort it takes to fight cartels and make large busts with huge media draws. You think that the public would be impressed if LE told the media that they made took down SR? The public doesn&#039;t even know what SR is, and LE has little interest in spending hundreds of hours tracking down that little crook who bought an eighth of weed.

				Just think in terms of ulterior motives.&nbsp; Perhaps there is an incentive for the government to actually look the other way.&nbsp; USPS is hurting financially and so is the country.&nbsp; Since drugs aren&#039;t legalized under federal law, SR is no competition to the US in terms of sales.&nbsp; Perhaps they realize that SR is providing a huge boost to USPS.&nbsp; Perhaps if all vendors used UPS and FedEx they would work harder to shut it down.&nbsp; Perhaps they realize that SR takes away demand for Mexican cartel drugs that one would buy on the streets if we didn&#039;t have SR.&nbsp; All these things should be taken into consideration.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically comes down to one thing: money.&nbsp; And the SR provides a lot of that to the USPS.&nbsp;

				hi<br /><br />so long as all the activity does not cause a nuisance to society it would not really matter for LE or any government...<br /><br />its when people become irresponsible or extremist the problem starts.<br /><br />imagine a world of growers who always grow in small quantities, and consumers who consume responsibly in small quantities, there will be no problem at all. Its only when &quot;business interests&quot; peek into the trade and few or more of the traders grows into greediness, there starts competition, and grow and grow .. which in turn leads to murder rape etc etc... <br /><br />There is that episode about the pot growers in the emerald triangle... and how the mendocino county economy is booming with pot etc... but say all the US counties were legally growing POT, then there would be enough supply to fulfill the demand, pot prices will drop and the crime will distribute all over but will come down substantially.... <br /><br />I believe they should legalize pot, may be have licenses to use pot, have pot-ed on how to use pot, and make sure psychologically ill people have no access to it, and also TAX pot.. that will solve every ones problem... They also should have some sort of too-big restrictions and limit pot growers to only small sizes... <br /><br />M8<br /><br /><br />

The issue is that it&#039;s such a small part of the drug trade. LE wants to bust 10 kilos of cocaine, not 2 grams of it. Maybe once SR gets big enough or LE gets enough funding (not in this economy) we will start to see concerted efforts to take SR down. But for now, they&#039;d be better off finding a needle in a haystack.

				To the above posters:&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t suggesting that law enforcement doesn&#039;t care about SR or want it shut down.&nbsp; I completely agree and they&#039;ve made that clear.&nbsp; I was simply trying to suggest reasons why they wouldn&#039;t want to wage an all out war against SR in trying to shut it down.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure of the exact numbers, but you&#039;re probably correct that out of all the mail USPS handles, mail from SR is a small percentage.&nbsp; However, neither you nor I can be certain on what that percentage is.&nbsp; And when the USPS is on life support for lack of a better analogy you can bet that the extra thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of even millions in revenue from SR isn&#039;t a bad thing for them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lots of people have different feelings on bitcoins.&nbsp; I completely disagree that bitcoin is going to save us and is the future of currency or can&#039;t be touched.&nbsp; Here&#039;s why.&nbsp; Bitcoin is a much larger threat to the government (and I&#039;m speaking in regards to the US government) than SR itself.&nbsp; It&#039;s top priority for the government and those in power to get rid of bitcoin.&nbsp; SR is a distant second.&nbsp; I believe bitcoin can exist for some time.&nbsp; But it won&#039;t last forever and it isn&#039;t the future of currency.<br /><br />The future of currency is the end of paper money.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t some pie in the sky idea.&nbsp; This is also being taken very seriously and discussed amongst top officials.&nbsp; As we&#039;ve seen in the news recently, the government is mighty powerful and has been over stepping lines set by our constitution and prying into our personal lives.&nbsp; Ever since 9/11 our personal freedoms have been disappearing at an exponential rate.&nbsp; If the government can eliminate and phase out paper money 100%, they will have complete control.&nbsp; Imagine all your money is now digital.&nbsp; Bank accounts and credit cards only.&nbsp; There is even talk of implanting chips into us where everyone would scan their arm when making a purchase.&nbsp; Every purchase you make will be tracked and recorded.&nbsp; Officials will be able to see exactly what you&#039;ve purchased.&nbsp; And if bitcoin is around at that point in time how is one to even acquire a bitcoin if there is no cash?&nbsp; How can we exchange cash for bitcoin or bitcoin for cash?&nbsp; We can&#039;t.&nbsp; We won&#039;t.&nbsp; And bitcoin will fail if it hadn&#039;t up until that point.&nbsp; Recently we&#039;ve seen how difficult it is to cash in by having to provide ID and paper work with many sources.&nbsp; Some speculate this is why bitcoin has been dropping in value over the past month.<br /><br />Just think about that for a minute.&nbsp; If money goes 100% digital someone could just flip a switch and when you go to buy gas, food or whatever you&#039;re cut off.&nbsp; Transaction declined.&nbsp; You&#039;re accounts are frozen.&nbsp; You are under complete control of the government.&nbsp; You want to talk about power?&nbsp; That&#039;s the ultimate in power.&nbsp; It&#039;s harder than ever to remain anonymous and this is how they want it.&nbsp; They want complete control.&nbsp;

				1. Technologically, you can&#039;t shut down SR without shutting down Tor. The US government sponsors Tor; US spies and assets use it in hostile countries.<br /><br />Plus, the Tor team is pretty savvy about waits to circumvent attempts to shut it down (like Iran has repeatedly tried). It wouldn&#039;t work.<br /><br />2. Nobody gives a shit about the tiny amount of money SR sales give to the USPS.<br /><br />3. The US Government is not anti bitcoin. Read http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html - their official position is that bitcoin is fine but people converting to/from fiat currencies have to be registered money services business, i.e. they have to collect customer info etc to prevent money laundering. That might change in the future, but at the moment, that&#039;s the deal.<br /><br />4. SR is tiny compared to their major targets, and it&#039;s not a sexy target because it doesn&#039;t have a lot of centralization. No big drug bust, no guns, (I hope) no major cartel connections, just a bunch of small time dealers.<br /><br />That depends of course on where the vendors are sourcing; if it&#039;s coming from one of the major cartels, then that&#039;ll definitely perk up some DEA agents&#039; ears. But the feds don&#039;t bother with small stuff, and state police don&#039;t have the resources to attack SR (though they can and do attack individual vendors who fuck up opsec).<br /><br /><br />Be a bit more realistic with the speculation. ;-)

				The same thing that&#039;s not stopping p2p file sharing and illegal movie downloads. They may be able to take down Silk Road, but Silk Road 2 will appear. The internet is too big for anyone to control, even if the CIA/NSA is collecting data about users...There are plenty of internet providers that are NOT providing them information. As long as there is nothing linking you to your SR account what do they have to go after. How do you fight something you cant see and as much as they hate it, our government does not have the money to chase down users that order small amounts of drugs for themselves. In a perfect world everything here would be legal. You could go to CVS and the pharmacist could say, you need 200ug of LSD but your lady friend only needs 100ug. We would be getting true LSD that is measured and paying taxes that would benefit the worlds economy. I really love this site because I don&#039;t have to go on the street. I have options to what i&#039;m looking for and the community is respectable. We all want the same, our own decisions on how we live our life. I don&#039;t want violence or harm to anyone.

				i dont know how SR is implemented but having it as just one hidden server is probably a bad idea. <br /><br />May be the tor guys have a better system of having hosting services like a rat, where they migrate from one hidden server to another <br />once in a while...&nbsp; or hopefully the SR operator host this of various nodes and keep the data moving from one hidden node to another so say event it got busted, for some reason it could get automatically rehosted from another site...<br /><br />look at the way pirate bay is still working... <br /><br /><br />

				This is an interesting topic. I feel like we&#039;ve definitely pissed them off to the point that their trying to actively do something about, and probably eventually will, but I&#039;m sure other sites like SR will pop up and become just as if not more popular. SR definitely represent a revolution of sorts which we will win unless the implement heavy regulation on the internet, digital currency, etc...idk it looks like were winning and I&#039;m hope this changes things as far as what&#039;s &quot;illegal&quot; etc....

Exactly man. We need more people to have this point of view. It&#039;s about moderation. Drugs are not inherently bad, but they are all poison when taken at certain doses and frequencies.
