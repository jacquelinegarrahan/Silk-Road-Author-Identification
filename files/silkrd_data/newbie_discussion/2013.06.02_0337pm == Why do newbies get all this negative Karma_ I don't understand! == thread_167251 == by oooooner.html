				I haven&#039;t picked any fights on here, and even when I write posts instead of doing the &quot;spamming&quot; to get to 50 or to 100, I still get negative Karma.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Is there a way to see who gives you the bad Karma?&nbsp; All newbies get this negative Karma and to all of you that do not know, it is important, especially if you&#039;re a vendor, to have more positive Karma than negative.&nbsp; Anyone more experienced have any answers out there for me?&nbsp; That would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Is this just like high school and people are mean to the new kids or what?&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t understand the Karma system at all so if someone could explain why it is important, or at the very least agree with me that they don&#039;t get it so this post can get some traction, that would be great...&nbsp; thanks!<br /><br />And I appreciate anyone who comments!<br />Thank you all very much.<br /><br />-o

				There&#039;s no way to see who gives it to you. Generally if you make a post that someone else thinks contains incorrect information you will receive a downvote. I know people do also just downvote posts they don&#039;t personally like. There&#039;s also always the chance you really pissed somebody off with something you posted and they downvote whatever they see you posting after that.

				Personally I feel it is much more respectable to just be dead honest with people not to insult them not to lie to em but not to beat around the bush either. I know with me I appreciate it with friends and I consider this friendly conversation being dead honest with me. If I tick you tell me again not insulting someone if I hit the nail on the head and you think so that&#039;s fine too. The point being if I&#039;m getting on your nerves of hopefully am doing the opposite I&#039;m aware of that instead of just guessing. Live by the golden rule and don&#039;t worry so much about the karma numbers they should take care of themselves that&#039;s my belief. That&#039;s just me!

				I think it would be great if the Karma system included the ability to see which votes garnered the up/down votes.&nbsp; That is, even though the voter would remain anonymous the posts that (dis)pleased the masses would be indicated accordingly.&nbsp; It would create a sort of positive / negative behavioral reinforcement system.&nbsp; It would just be cool to see how people feel about particular opinions or forms of expression.<br /><br />Plus, if we all know what (dis)pleases everyone we can all strive to post in a manner pleasing to the the masses thereby creating a homogenous community of drug fueled, like thinking, like posting lemmings.&nbsp; It&#039;s a win-win proposition!<br />&nbsp;;)

				I think you got most of your bad karma from the drama you&#039;ve had when you first posted on the forums... People get bad karma if they&#039;re exposing themselves at risk and disclose personal information, not always when they&#039;re pissing people off. And in your first first post, you showed that you weren&#039;t very secure so you got bad karma (because of the drama). And also for some reason haters give bad karma in the newbie section, but maybe that&#039;s also because newbies misinform? I don&#039;t know exactly.

				Hi Oooooer,<br /><br />I received -14 karma&#039;s overnight and I&#039;m not a vendor, but I was a little hurt because I am an honest and nice person and I am not the type of person who get&#039;s involved with heated debates or insults someone. I took the issue to a moderator, and he/she said its probably some person with 14 accounts that&#039;s given you the 14 negative Karma&#039;s. I now it has to be since I barely posted anything one day and came back the next day to find -14? Some people with no lives enjoy doing that.&nbsp; Why? We&#039;ll never know.&nbsp; Ok, let me give you Karma for your business diligence Ooooner, anyone reading this, PLEASE SEE Ooooner&#039;s Vendor page.&nbsp; She/He is a wonderful Vendor, will go out of their way for you.&nbsp; To all Newbies, let Ooooner be your 1st, start small, and make it good experience.&nbsp; Please read all policies for any Vendor so you are not unpleasantly surprised.&nbsp; <br /><br />Luv to All...

				Sclerogal, a lot of people have received -14 at once lately... Razorspyne addressed the issue but mods always locked his threads. You&#039;re already the third one to which it has happened... Razorsyne thinks it&#039;s one of the mods but if you weren&#039;t involved with mods when you got that -14 then it could prove him wrong. That whole mass negging is pretty weird.

Weird.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh I wasn&#039;t implying that at all, tree, I was just stating that we&#039;re all getting it too.<br /><br />No idea why someone would want to do this (perhaps it&#039;s even to cause a rift, like it seems to have succeeded in doing for some outrageous reason), but none of us have any way to know who it is so accusations can only be presented as pure speculation. It couldn&#039;t actually be a moderator seeing as we&#039;re all getting it and you can&#039;t give yourself karma so the only other possibility is that it&#039;s somebody else / a group doing it to see how much of a ruckus they can cause. Outrageous that people are falling for it though on a revolutionary forum such as this given that they&#039;re just anonymous internet points but what can ya do! :o<br /><br />Libertas

				Maybe it&#039;s a bot? I don&#039;t think some people would get together as a group to get -14 karma in 30 seconds. One single person would require a lot of VMs and a big screen to give so much karma in so little time. In both cases, it would a lot of effort just to slightly annoy some people..

				In my experience I&#039;ve found out that yes, the first times are the more problematic for what it concerns Karma. Until you don&#039;t have a solid + or - figure anything can give you one or the other, sometimes without either you understanding why.<br /><br />One thing I can advice you to get you started on getting more good karma is to try help others in a field you think you know a little about. For example when I was new as soon as I got my 50 posts I tried to reply to concerns about psychedelics and similar because this is the field where I have more knowledge about. Others do the same for what it concerns security or shipping, or either other drugs; the choice is yours.<br /><br />If then you really see you are in trouble with the Karma and you really cannot get some how much you try, go in off topic and post in the Karma thread. If you spread the love you will also receive a lot there.<br /><br />As a last thing don&#039;t worry too much at beginning either if you get bad Karma for nothing. It happened to me also. You cannot do nothing about it anyway. Whatever motivation (either the most out of this world) can make you get bad Karma as a newcomer. That&#039;s how it works, sadly.

				Listen guys I feel we are missing the point here. Is karma important well yes but you know whats more important? Acting in a manner that is respectful of the other members and helpful towards voicing accurate and helpful information on the threads. Honesty plays a role too but if you go in to this with the soul intention of receiving only good karma and never reviving bad karma that&#039;s just not helpful to anyone here including yourself. <br /><br />Sometimes members are going to disagree with you, your gonna make mistakes it&#039;s gonna happen.If I disagree with someone I do so in as respectful and mature manner as possible That&#039;s my 2 cents. But this mentality of posting for the soul purpose of karma gains is just gonna drive you to madness. That&#039;s not fun!<br /><br />B.T.W How do I give karma their are some great points brought up here as well as some excellent questions that I feel need to be rewarded???

It is more than understandable.<br /><br />Also if the karma system is not perfect as it is, anyway it is very difficult that a person with much more + than - is a troll, and the same being true for the contrary. It is just at beginning, until you pass a certain threshold so as to have a karma figure more established, that it&#039;s like riding a roller-coaster.

				From what I understand their is nothing to karma besides reputation on the boards. To some people that may not mean much and to me personally I feel my name as you get to know me better and see my post will bring its own karma despite what any negative or positive numbers may indicate. So in that respect I lend very little weight to karma and very high weight to reputation on the board. Actions speak louder than words or in this case numbers. See you guys around and be safe.

				Its not just newbs.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only just started posting after months of reading posts. There is a thread in the rumor mill for UK cannabis buyers experiences. Seems anyone in that thread leaves a good review for a vendor who is not flavor of the month you will get negative karma. It is a very clique group who don&#039;t like outsiders saying something good about someone they hate. They must be working for that vendor or something. <br /><br />Mostly I think they&#039;re all as paranoid as fuck. Good karma bad karma. I think most of us have other things to be worrying about.

				After reading through this post it seems that positive Karma is dished out fairly while negative is, at times, dumped on people with little justification.&nbsp; If someone has a high positive number that&#039;s about all I need to see and I&#039;ll assume that they have probably been active and helpful on the board.&nbsp; A negative number I&#039;m aware of but really don&#039;t give it much credit.<br /><br />
