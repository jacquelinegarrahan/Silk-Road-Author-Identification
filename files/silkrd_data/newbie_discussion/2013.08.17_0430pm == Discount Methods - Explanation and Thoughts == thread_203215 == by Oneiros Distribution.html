				Title: <strong>Discount Methods - Explanation and Thoughts</strong><br />

				Creating this thread as sort of a complementary to the thread Upgraded Listing Options: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182090<br /><br />I would say there are four Discount Methods here on Silk Road, they are as follows:<br /><br />A) Static Listing Discount<br />B) Static Amount Discount<br />C) Progressive Discount<br />D) Unit Based Discount<br /><br />A) Static Listing Discount<br /><br />This is the most common method utilized here on Silk Road and it simply amounts to creating separate listings for each amount of product, highly ineffective in terms of keeping track of quantity, separates feedback from the same products and creates clutter in the Silk Road Listings. Currently the Top 10 Vendors on Silk Road for Drug Products are the following sorted by popularity: Sukey, NorCalKing, FrankMatthews, Lloydsbrothers, dispater, SydneysFinest, atlas2012, FASTWAYS, deezletime and alaska. Of these 10 currently 9 of them are using Static Listing Discount except NorCalKing which seems to offer no Quantity Discounts.<br /><br />B) Static Amount Discount<br /><br />This method is when a Vendor states certain ranges and the buyer gets a specific Discount based on that range. Here&#039;s an example on how it could look like:<br /><br />1-5 gram: Price per gram + 20,00 % = 81,60 kr ( 81,60 kr - 408,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 1 ]<br />5-15 gram: Price per gram ± 0,00 % = 68,00 kr ( 340,00 kr - 1020,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />15-30 gram: Price per gram - 10,00 % = 61,20 kr ( 918,00 kr - 1836,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />30-50 gram: Price per gram - 20,00 % = 54,40 kr ( 1632,00 kr - 2720,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />50-75 gram: Price per gram - 30,00 % = 47,60 kr ( 2380,00 kr - 3570,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 3 ]<br />75-200 gram: Price per gram - 40,00 % = 40,80 kr ( 3060,00 kr - 8160,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 4 ]<br /><br />The main drawback with this system is the Vendor has to create a Custom Order for all orders which takes roughly a minute, on top of deciphering the message from the buyer. With a Static Discount per Range some strange situations occur when ordering 30 grams is cheaper than ordering 29 grams as 30 grams is in a higher Range. Some benefits are having very good overview of how much product is left assuming one is editing the Main Listing after each Custom Order, another one is not bringing unnecessary clutter to the Silk Road Listings.<br /><br />C) Progressive Discount<br /><br />An Upgrade to Static Amount Discount which solves the Range problem by giving a set Discount based on Range and a Bonus Discount for each additional gram or unit. Here&#039;s an example on how it could look like:<br /><br />1-4 gram: Price per gram + 20,00 % = 96,00 kr ( 96,00 kr - 384,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 1 ]<br />5-15 gram: Price per gram ± 0,00 % = 80,00 kr ( 400,00 kr - 1200,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />20-60 gram: Price Reduced 12,00 % + 0,20 % Discount per gram beyond 20 gram ( 1408,00 kr - 3840,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 3 ]<br />100-200 gram: Price Reduced 24,00 % + 0,16 % Discount per gram beyond 100 gram ( 6080,00 kr - 9600,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 4 ]<br /><br />( Some examples on how much Discount a couple of ranges would give: 20 ( 12 % ), 25 ( 13 % ), 45 ( 17 % ), 100 ( 24 % ), 144 ( 31,04 %), 200 ( 40 % ) )<br /><br />This is technically one of the fairest and most efficient way of deciding the Discount, it is also unfortunately one of the most Time Consuming as each Listing has to be calculated manually and the buyer could potentially order a very peculiar amount of Product.<br /><br />D) Unit Based Discount<br /><br />The intention is taking the strengths of all previous Discount Systems and combining them into one. The Unit Based Discount works more or less exactly like a Static Listing Discount but with less clutter on the Silk Road Listings, more control on Inventory and the possibility of setting a max amount of product bought per order. Here&#039;s an example how it could look like:<br /><br />10 gram: Price Reduction 18,00 % ( 10,00*0,82*64,00=524,80 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />15 gram: Price Reduction 22,00 % ( 15,00*0,78*64,00=748,80 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />20 gram: Price Reduction 26,00 % ( 20,00*0,74*64,00=947,20 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />25 gram: Price Reduction 30,00 % ( 25,00*0,70*64,00=1120,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />40 gram: Price Reduction 32,00 % ( 40,00*0,68*64,00=1740,80 kr ) [ Shipping Class 2 ]<br />60 gram: Price Reduction 40,00 % ( 60,00*0,60*64,00=2304,00 kr ) [ Shipping Class 3 ]<br />----------<br />Now the main point of this thread is no matter what Discount System is chosen in the end it all revolves around the fact one is trying to fix a problem Silk Road could theoretically solve on their end, as I&#039;ve described in the thread Upgraded Listing Options: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182090<br /><br />The current System works but it&#039;s inefficient and the more Products are listed the worse it works, with a standardized Upgraded Listing Option System these problems could be solved permanently along with the added bonus of being able to filter products perfectly based on amount and pricing. This is not just a technical solution but a mindset which would have to be adopted by every single Vendor after it&#039;s been implemented. I would strongly recommend implementing a System similar to this before Silk Road gets so big a change like this wouldn&#039;t be possibly any longer due to its scale. Hopefully anyone who read this far found some of this interesting enough to read. :)

				Took me awhile to figure out what the hell this guy was talking about, but whatever it is, I stand behind it as it seems like it would be an improvement to the Road.<br /><br />Fuck yeah to this guy and +1 Karma for working all this out. This is some tough shit to wade through, thank you.
