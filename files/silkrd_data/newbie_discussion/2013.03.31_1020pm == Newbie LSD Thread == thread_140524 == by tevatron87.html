				Hey, This could turn out to be a spam zone to 50, or this could be a relevant place for Newbies to post some very basic information about their LSD order. <br /><br />I just purchased from Flying Dutchman, with my questions answered immediately, I am now awaiting delivery. I will post in the official Avengers LSD Forum once I hit 50 posts, and have tested my product. With all the LD stuff recently coming about and everybody being on their heels with this product, I was hoping to hear more people speak about Flying Dutchman, even if I hear about it in the Avengers forum.<br /><br />Have a great trip all!

				I personally have only ever tried LucyDrop&#039;s acid from SR<br />infact they were so popular around me for a while that they were <br />starting to be called &quot;lucydrop&#039;s&quot; and even non-SR trippers were calling them that haha<br /><br />but i have also tried two different tabs from IRL from friends i knew.<br />the first time i ever tried it, was one tab and it was pretty much bunk and that was from a friend<br />then i tried 3 LD (good batch) and tripped very nicely to say the least hahaha<br /><br />i tried LD a few more times and all trips were pretty good depending on some other factors but <br />overall a good product<br />my most recent trip was acid from street and it was by far the best ive ever had (2 tabs) tripped extremely well <br />and i haven&#039;t come across any since (that was about 3 weeks ago)<br /><br />It sucks bc a lot of vendors (LSD and otherwise) wont ship to America...meanwhile <br />the streets are flooded with RC&#039;s and bunk sheets<br />I have some intrest in Nevita&#039;s bulk order(s)<br />as well as Haisenberg&#039;s <br /><br />and i eventually would like to getting around to try a few other vendors as well<br />once i get the time and money and reach 50 ill be on the avenger thread for a week strait haha

				So is the LSD sold on SR generally actual LSD or is it a various assortment of research chemicals being sold as &quot;LSD&quot;?<br /><br />I ask because most &quot;LSD&quot; sold in my experience is actually nbome or something similar.

				I ordered from mahakala here on SR. Ordered 5 and got 6, so that was very nice of him (or her)&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I ate the acid at about 13:00. And after about 30min I could feel something was beginning to happen in my mind. And after 30-60min talking was a little bit difficult, like stuttering the words on my tongue like I was not sober. Probably took til +90minutes or more until visuals slowly appeared from the hidden dimension of the LSD...<br /><br />I took one tab of 100ug to start with, and my brother and I split on another one like after 2 - 2.5h. So the effects lasted to around 22:00 and afterglow that ended quite fast, but I couldn&#039;t sleep until around 02:00.<br /><br />But goddamn did I feel good on that acid, I just couldn&#039;t sit still. I danced to the rhytm of the music all day and I when I sat down or layed down I touched my skin on my arms and my head non stop, I really felt ecstatic and the rush of serotonin like on mdma. That lasted almost 4-5 days afterwards that I felt completely rejuvenated and more happy than usual. I often feel down and not having energy to do things or meet people at all nowadays so it was really refreshing.<br /><br />In my experience those tabs definitely was 100mics as promised. I did much shrooms acid and mdma when I was younger and between 17-23. But now I&#039;m 32 and almost felt like a grown apart from the psychedelics, but now I have been reminded of them and will be placing a new order soon.<br /><br />So I recommend mahakala&#039;s product. Peace out!

				I recently dropped some of Fartbombers Avatar lsd and it was incredible!!! Best acid I`ve had since the mid 90`s. I`m not sure if he has any listings right now, but I would highly recommend his hits! Jerseycow is also a very good and trustworthy vendor. I`ll be ordering some of his stars soon:)

				Trying LSD is the reason I signed up to SR. Always wanted to try it never had the opportunity and I&#039;ve seen people messed up by using something they thought was LSD and getting fucked up. SR seems nice and safe way to acquire good LSD.

				Are you asking where to drop LSD?&nbsp; I happen to think that the outdoors is the best place to be.. Try the beach, the mountains, somewhere where you can get in touch with nature...<br /><br />Then again I have dropped acid or eaten shrooms on a bus, on the trolley, anyplace... My favorite thing to do is find a willing candidate or two and turn them on and gift them the knowledge.... people kind of trip out on that I have found... try giving the guy asking for change a hit of acid instead of money... last time I did this I saw the guy a week later sitting under a tree reading a book and not asking for money... ha.<br /><br />mm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :P

I think that&#039;d be much better than a hotel tbh.

				For the first time(s) LSD should be done in a place where you feel safe and comfortable, and where you have been many times. Taking the first trip in a forest you don&#039;t hang around in a lot is like going to a random point beside a pool and jumping. Might fuck you up bad as you jump to shallow, might jump off the far end. So just keep it safe.<br /><br />I ordered some of the Scurvy Crew&#039;s double sided Hoffmans, and they&#039;re going to arrive some time soon. I&#039;ll report back here with a review once I get to tripping.

				Hey all, just wanted to put a mention in for &#039;Haizenburg&#039; i bought 5 tabs off him @ 100mcg a hit. Arrived within one week to mainland Europe with clever packaging. I took two tabs and had a very visual, meaningful&nbsp; long lasting trip. Felt rather clean and a nice euphoric come up, took three tabs a week or so following and a was nice intense trip, these are deffo acid(avengers tested) and deffo 100mcg min.<br />Just about to place an order for a ten strip.<br />Really nice guy to deal with and&nbsp; this acid is cheap! great price per hit and one should have you trippin.<br /><br />Also shout out to DMTNEXUS for his brilliant advice skills and his super strong dmt. Order away this guy really knows his shit!<br />Be safe kids!<br />
