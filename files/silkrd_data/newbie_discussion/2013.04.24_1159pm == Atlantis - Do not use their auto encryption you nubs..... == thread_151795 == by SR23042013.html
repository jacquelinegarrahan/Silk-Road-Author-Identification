				I was very surprised when they offered this &quot;feature&quot; as they are either completely ignorant of the whole point of encryption or it is indeed a massive honey pot. <br /><br />Messaging via plain text that is auto encrypted by the server is well..... facepalm worthy. The whole point of encrypting a message is so even if the server is compromised all they will get is a bunch of gibberish. You can never be sure that they are not storing the unencrypted messages in the database somewhere. <br /><br />This is one thing I think DPR is probably well aware of which is why he never bothered to implement it. I&#039;m sure there will be plenty of noobs writing their life story into atlantis thinking their message will be encrypted by the server and &quot;safe&quot;.<br /><br />tl;dr<br />don&#039;t use the encryption feature on atlantis.

				I haven&#039;t gotten far enough through Atlantis&#039;s checkout mechanism to tell, since I haven&#039;t funded my account, but,<br />couldn&#039;t you just paste a PGP-encrypted message into their address box, whether they claim to encrypt it or not? <br />IIRC SR also encrypts the contents of the address box, but doing it yourself is just good sense. If they don&#039;t allow <br />that then no one should use them.

				I hope Atlantis is legit because it is a nice design and set up, takes litecoins, and would relieve some of the traffic / pressure on Silk.&nbsp; But just as a precaution I would only use your own PGP software for encryption. If Atlantis is for real, and it gains some good vendors in the coming months, I think it will do very well. We&#039;re just at the beginning, anon markets are here to STAY.<br /><br />Has anyone succesfully used Atlantis, or SheepMarket? SheepMarket has a nice design but literally like 20 listings of weed and random prescription stuff. I don&#039;t even know if they use escrow. I think time will flesh out concerns/bugs/honeypots
