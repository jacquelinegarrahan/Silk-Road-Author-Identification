			<dd class="postbody">
				So Last week I&#039;ve ordered from 3 vendors<br /><br />I live in a pineapple under the sea------- This was my fist time ordering from the road so I was quite worried and since my country is a real strict one, (They had barnacle stones) I made sure to inform the vendors about it, but since they all were small amounts, stealthily packed in regular mail wouldnt be a problem. I found out that otters have bowls. <br /><br />I was so happy, literally heart racing when I saw my first mail on gloop of the afternoon. following day (wednesday) I got my DMT from jetlag&nbsp; And not its Saturday in my country and still no mail from aluwanda. To be honest I was looking forward to the Ecstasy so much, If I didnt have the hash or it came late, I wouldnt be so tensed, same with the DMT. But Its been as shrekulous experience<br /><br />Waiting for the mailman is a fucking bitch though, He comes at irregular times, sometimes mailing in the afternoon, Its annoying since my jeep needs his soup for the day.I stay in the swamp<br /><br /><br />Im looking forward to this and getting myself disappointed. Any tips? Its frustrating when you check your mail and theres nothing there. onionrings

				I know all to well how disappointing it is to not receive your mail when you are expecting it!<br />I have been waiting quite some time for my package, and it was domestic :O lets just say, resolve is now available.<br />I&#039;m trying to give my vendor the benefit of a doubt, but if it does not show up by tomorrow afternoon, I&#039;m requesting a refund and giving a shit review. I&#039;m a pretty broke fellow so a vendor keeping my coin tied up for so long sucks, I could have used that coin and ordered from a vendor I know would have already got my order to me.<br /><br />At least you got some of your stuff :)

				Ain&#039;t that the damn truth!&nbsp; I know waiting for an alprazolam order to come in the mail when I have none to take is agonizing, a total double whammy.&nbsp; The only comfort I get while waiting is thinking about how happy I&#039;ll be when it does show up, power of positive thinking and all that heh.

				if it makes you feel any better, i used to vend a year or so ago before retiring...... and one of my good customers was located in malaysia.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;ve mailed there about 10-12 times.&nbsp; had really good results using private carriers there since there aren&#039;t a lot of advantages to using USPS into malaysia (or anywhere&nbsp; else) except for volume.&nbsp; &nbsp;it cost 90USD for UPS/DHL etc to deliver, but the tracking.... omg, after dealing with USPS for international shipping, its fucking unbelievable.&nbsp; they update you at every stop, sometimes twice.<br /><br />mailing to australia would ALWAYS go to juneau first.&nbsp; then it would did some strange routes like juneau, taiwan, singapore, korea, perth.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />however there is something to be said for lack of good tracking.&nbsp; its kind of like fcm&nbsp; &nbsp;eventually, you stop thinking bout it since there are no updates.... and then one day you check the mail and its there.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />i actually have one problem.&nbsp; many countries don&#039;t require declaration for documents.&nbsp; &nbsp;malaysia apparently does, and i got a very scary call one day from the post office to my burner phone.&nbsp; they needed me to come down there and FILL OUT&nbsp; A DECLARATION.&nbsp; &nbsp;after a bit of a freakout, i could tell this was not an LE operation because of the way the USPS lady was acting.&nbsp; &nbsp;i didn&#039;t want to abandon it since it had the customer&#039;s address on it.... so after much discussion i went up in that bitch and filled out a declaration.

				Right there with you guys. Waiting is the worste. Absolute worste. <br /><br />I ordered express usps domestic 3 days ago and STILL nothing. This is supposed to be a damn overnight delivery and having to wait like this is killing me. I paid a pretty penny for express too. UHG.

				I don&#039;t buy huge amounts at a time because it&#039;s drugs on the internet lol. If something doesn&#039;t show up I let the vendor know but I consider that the price of doing business. If they offer a refund or reship that&#039;s great. If they sent it and it has a tracking number that shows a delivery that&#039;s just my tough luck. The mailman can be kind of a fuck up where I live anyway. I came here expecting that a certain amount of people here are nothing but scammers. I think I got taken by one, but all the rest have been fine. It wasn&#039;t a big enough amount to lose sleep over or anything so I just move on and don&#039;t care. I just spend a lot of time checking out vendors and you can easily see who the pros are if you look long enough. I don&#039;t think I would ever do three orders at once though. Plausible deniability of one package is one thing, but if they catch the first one and then start looking and get the other two from different vendors that deniability goes way down. I do one order at a time, wait to receive, then place the next like a week later. Slow and patient wins.

				Well, I finally got word from the long shipping delay vendor, He says tracking says it will arrive tomorrow. I&#039;m quite excited. Even though It should have arrived last monday, It works out. I have much to do this week, so the timing will be perfect if it shows up tomorrow. WooHoo!

				I like what AbuNazir said.&nbsp; Patience is Key.&nbsp; When I first started buying I was always cutting it close... Usually ordering 2 weeks before an event and praying that the order arrived on time.&nbsp; Usually the order would arrive just in the nic of time, but every once in a while it wouldn&#039;t arrive in time.&nbsp; Moral of the story.&nbsp; Plan ahead.&nbsp; I think most people think ahead but they may not have the fiscal resources to order a month before they actually need the product.&nbsp; If that&#039;s you there are ways around this obstacle.&nbsp; PM me if you&#039;d like to know how I got around cash flow issues.&nbsp;

				UHHH I hate waiting for the mail man. A few days ago on a coke binge up all night waiting for the mail I got the most paranoid ive ever gotten in my entire life. My mail usually gets here at 11-12pm the latest. So when 1pm came rolling around I was freaking out. To the point of waiting by my window looking out. Started to think people stole my mail, or that I was gonna get some LE at my door with a package. Long story short it got here late at 2:30pm... don&#039;t stay up on coke and wait for your mail it might just well drive you cray.

				I get paranoid EVERYTIME I order.. Sometimes theres nothing really you can do about that aside from ordering from someone with extremely positive &quot;Stealth&quot; reviews.. Someone with &gt;300 transactions and ~+/- 99 Feedback score.

I had ordered 100mg of DMT from Italy, 1g of hash from Netherlands and 2 Mortal Kombat pills (ecstasy) from Netherlands as well. The hash and DMT were on transit on tuesday, and the Ecstasy on wednesday. (Last week 18th and 19th June)<br /><br />I live in South east Asia, This was my fist time ordering from the road so I was quite worried and since my country is a strict one, I made sure to inform the vendors about it, but since they all were small amounts, stealthily packed in regular mail wouldnt be a problem. I found out that from Netherlands, it should take 8 days to receive the mail. <br /><br />I was so happy, literally heart racing when I saw my first mail on tuesday, It was from the Netherlands and was the Hash, the following day (wednesday) I got my DMT from Italy... And not its Saturday in my country and still no mail from Netherlands for my ecstasy pills. To be honest I was looking forward to the Ecstasy so much, If I didnt have the hash or it came late, I wouldnt be so tensed, same with the DMT. But Its been 10 days.. It should arrive the following days.. I hope.<br /><br />Waiting for the mailman is a fucking bitch though, He comes at irregular times, sometimes mailing in the afternoon, Its annoying since some of my family stays with me and they receive mail too so I have to always make sure to check often. I live in a kind of apartment, its only 4 levels and there are like 5 other buildings with the same levels...<br /><br />Im looking forward to this and getting myself disappointed. Any tips? Its frustrating when you check your mail and theres nothing there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I feel you man. <br /><br />I spend most of my time in a strict country as well, but its nothing compared to yours.<br /><br />It is difficult not knowing when to expect the package, especially when some one sharing the address is best to not know about the mail from random countries. Here the mail man comes anywhere from 12-17. Thats a long time to make sure no one else gets to the mail first. And impossible if Im working.<br /><br />My advice would be to order with tracking. In that way You can follow the package through its journey to you :)<br /><br />Also, doing more research before buying takes away some of the stress.<br /><br />Otherwise its something that goes away with time. My first time sure as hell was scary&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Regards,<br />bluehorn

It sucks because I don&#039;t understand why it would take so long, I google flight times between other countries and mine, estimate the sorting time (i watched several documentaries and videos about a &#039;journey of a letter&#039;, how it goes through electronic sorters, all the conveyer belts etc), I don&#039;t see why It should take this long... Well I guess i&#039;m being a dick and underestimating the amount they have to sort, or my postal service is just shit :\<br /><br />

				I made the newb mistake of getting worried when your package takes longer than you expect it too. It just ends up that way sometimes. There is just a ton of mail and packages being delivered all around the world and some of them end up getting sorted the wrong way and heading the opposite direction. After you place an order and it is marked in transit, just don&#039;t expect anything in particular and know you&#039;re gonna be in for a great surprise one day. Or instead of thinking about how long a package is taking to arrive, think about how amazing it is to get drugs delivered right to your doorstep. It&#039;s almost as amazing as the original silk road.

				The best way to get over the wait time is to have a set date for you and your friends to consume said &quot;products&quot; this makes it so that, at least for me, in your head you&#039;re not waiting on the mail, you are waiting and looking forward to a good time. ;)

So I&#039;ll have to try that out later as well. I&#039;ll update when the mailman arrives!

				Got my first order today! Super fast delivery, so no waiting for me on that, arrived within 1 business day.<br /><br />Now the longest waiting begins, although some of the anxiety is gone now, since I&#039;m getting closer.<br /><br />But I&#039;m sure in a few days it&#039;ll be back haha!

				Damn, this is the only downside to getting drugs off the internet. It&#039;s the worst thing ever to have to wait 3+ days for your goodies to come in the mail. I hate the fact that my mail isn&#039;t delivered until late afternoon as well. It should be a crime to have to wait until 4 PM to receive your mail. The day I&#039;m expecting my packages, I&#039;m always sitting on my bed staring out my window at my mailbox like a fucking crackhead looking out for police. The worst is when there&#039;s a delay in the shipping for whatever reason and it takes a day longer than what it should be. I almost flipped shit when I waited around all day on the 4th of July only to find out that no mail was fucking being delivered that day. Man, talk about crushed hopes.

				I don&#039;t think I get mail on saturday or sundays in my country (I&#039;m not sure)... Probably because I only get my mail on weekdays as I&#039;ve noticed... Best bet is keep in touch with vendor and hope for monday. I usually have to wait 8-12 days for packages so meh :\

				Oh man its 12/13 days in, i&#039;m getting pretty worried actually... If it doesn&#039;t come tomorrow, I have another weekend long wait for monday.. I&#039;m actually getting really suspicious that the postal services noticed or are suspicious about several international letters within a month going to one location.. I may be over thinking but Its really bugging me... Whats the longest you&#039;ve guys waited? and have you ordered over 5 letters/packages within a month with no problem?<br />I&#039;m waiting from 2 different orders right now... one of them shouldn&#039;t take this long and the other was marked in transit 2 days before being sent...

Not sure about you guys but in Aus there&#039;s no such thing as mail delivery on Saturday/Sundays and public holidays, so if your package doesnt arrive friday and its a public holiday monday its close to devastating... happened to me in June. &gt;:(&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily I dont get my weed from the road so I smoked and drunk for 3 days.. And on the tuesday 3 packages arrived, the third I didnt expect for a week or so cause it was from a far away magical place.

				yeah i know the problem with the mail man too.<br />i hate to go to the mail box to find nothing.<br />so i had orderd 25 dalailamas from fartbomber and 1g amphetamin from a german vendor.(i live in germany).<br />so the amphetamin arrived next day as expectet but the lsd tabs still on their way since friday.the came from nl.i really hope they made it.the last time orders from nl need 5 days so the date of arriving the tabs shoud be tomorrow.and i really hope there comming.<br /><br />im very long on silkroad ordering stuff but when something get lost and you check your mailbox every day a few times for weeks and theres nothing i want to shot my mailman^^ but i must say from 43 orders ive done the last year only 7 dosent show up....but the packages were only lsd so im a bit worried that they dont arrive....<br /><br />i know my first weed order from nl arrived in 4 days and the emplove was damaged.when the mailman put it in my pobox it began to stink very hard.but it arrived.i saw how the mailman put the damaged emplove in my box.so i think when a package is damaged and smells very heavy after weed and it still arrive the tabs will do so too.

Hash, DMT and Ecstasy.<br /><br />I live in South east Asia ------- This was my fist time ordering from the road so I was quite worried and since my country is a real strict one, I made sure to inform the vendors about it, but since they all were small amounts, stealthily packed in regular mail wouldnt be a problem. I found out that from Netherlands, it should take 8 days to receive the mail. <br /><br />I was so happy, literally heart racing when I saw my first mail on tuesday, It was from the Netherlands and was the Hash, the following day (wednesday) I got my DMT from Italy... And not its Saturday in my country and still no mail from Netherlands for my ecstasy pills. To be honest I was looking forward to the Ecstasy so much, If I didnt have the hash or it came late, I wouldnt be so tensed, same with the DMT. But Its been 10 days.. It should arrive the following days.. I hope.<br /><br />Waiting for the mailman is a fucking bitch though, He comes at irregular times, sometimes mailing in the afternoon, Its annoying since some of my family stays with me and they receive mail too so I have to always make sure to check often. I live in a kind of apartment, its only 4 levels and there are like 5 other buildings with the same levels...<br /><br />Im looking forward to this and getting myself disappointed. Any tips? Its frustrating when you check your mail and theres nothing there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good luck with ur orders bro, im sure they will come, some of the people here really know what they are doing.

You can say no MMM today, did an all nighter with 25i and weed and felt almost like I was on ecstasy, just in bliss listening to amazing tracks! I didn&#039;t even wake up late and I&#039;m having a nice afterglow!<br /><br />@Totalplay, hahahahhaa buddy that was quite some time back! but I did recieve my orders though thank you very much :D<br /><br />@Jugg My hopes are on monday for me jugg, got something for the weekend I suppose? 8) I&#039;m almost out of weed and I&#039;m waiting for some small hash and my pipe to come! then another small bag of weed.. The thing about ordering for me now is that I might be moving to another town sometime either late this month or next month, so I&#039;m worried that if I order something now, I might be gone when it gets here :S So I think I gotta take a break from the Road unfortunately... i&#039;ll be active on forums, for all I know i might even place one last order for the time being haha
