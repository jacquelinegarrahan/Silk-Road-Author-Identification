				Check out his listings...&nbsp; I placed an order, he says he shipped and wants me to finalize early.&nbsp; I have MORE than enough stats to qualify not to finalize early.&nbsp; <br /><br />My instinct is telling me something may be fishy.&nbsp; Or not!&nbsp; I&#039;ll update this once I receive.<br /><br />Anyone else order??<br />&nbsp; <br />15 roxys for à¸¿3.80 bitcoins???&nbsp; I get these are &quot;introductory specials&quot; to draw attention, but still.&nbsp; Too good to be true??&nbsp; I don&#039;t want the feds knockin at my door tmrw, ya know?<br /><br />His profile:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/72f8c0b9e4<br /><br />Am I just being overly paranoid?

				I actually attempted ordering 10 roxy 15&#039;s from this vendor and the next day I got on to check the status of it and the vendor seemed to have canceled the order, for which reason I do not know...<br /><br />I have well over 15 orders and no refunds, so I&#039;d assume the vendor may have ran out.<br /><br />Seems legit... but not 100% sure<br /><br />

Roxies fly out the door as is, and i feel it&#039;s better to build long-standing relationships with happy returning established customers than to entertain any and all possible scam buyer accounts with no $ stats.&nbsp; <br /><br />best wishes on the road!!<br />xoxo<br />-mb

				NOLUV22 let my order sit.&nbsp; I sent him a message on the third day and he wrote back asking me for my transaction number.&nbsp; Sent him my transaction number then asked him to just cancel my order after reading in these forums that people received half fake pills from him.&nbsp; He let my order sit two more days until I was able to cancel on my own.&nbsp; He then wrote me that they are overbooked and can only serve 25-30 customers.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t get that.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t provide what you&#039;re selling, take down your listings and cancel the orders you aren&#039;t going to be able to get to.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked with some GREAT vendors on SR and NOLUV22 is not one of them.

				Yep noluv sucks.&nbsp; Of the 10 oxies I ordered, only 5 were real!&nbsp; I am in resolution with him now, because he refused to make it right with me. Don&#039;t buy from noluv, unless you like taking chances with your money!

				ROFL Really? Same with me bro. I got 10 and 5 were fake. I got a 70% refund from the resolution team. He tried to say that I was being difficult and that the pills weren&#039;t fake but I took pictures of the bad pills so he was screwed. I also know of other people besides you he is scamming. Btw, NEVER FE!!! I am lucky that I didn&#039;t.

				Man sp3, I shouldve asked for more than 50%, but oh well I got what I asked for!&nbsp; He was a complete moron from the get go.&nbsp; He asked me to finalize before I even had a chance to look at the pills.&nbsp; Of course I didnt, but I knew then something wasnt right.&nbsp; I checked them and yep half were fake.&nbsp; It was a pain in the ass messaging with him after that, as he lied and bullshitted me quite a bit, but it got him no where. It was quite pathetic really, all his stupid lies and antics he tried to pull with me through PM, and then through resolution. He actually thought I would buy more from him to somehow solve him selling me fake pills!&nbsp; WTF!&nbsp; Anyways, thanks SR staff for making right for me.&nbsp; Screw noluv, that scamming, lying shit stain. I got to leave him a 1 feedback and bad review for his page too, which was very satisfying.&nbsp; Although I cant see it cuz he either blocked me or he got booted by SR.
