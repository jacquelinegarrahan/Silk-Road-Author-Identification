Ever. <br /><br />We Choose To, IF We Choose To.<br /><br />We take weeks/months/forever off if &amp; when we choose. <br /><br />Even if you have no pubes, You should not have all your eggs in one basket, go &amp; ask grandma what she would do.<br /><br />I guarantee she&#039;d have/has a half dozen reliable, verified suppliers for whatever her needs be.<br /><br />Come &amp; Buy Some Weed &amp; Have A Think About It.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 gave it to you<br /><br />REALY REALLY WELL SAID...<br /><br /><br /><br />To the OP (opening poster aka the person who starts a thread)<br /><br />I get this is is a section for newbies on the road..but that does not mean you are idiots..yet with your post you have proven that not only are you new....but you are dumb. And that is the worst combo for someone on SR as a buyer...you will be a vendors worst nightmare... How you don&#039;t understand it and had to make a post is unreal. <br /><br />But another reason weekends are easy for us vendors to take off is that we 100% depend on the mail. And there is only mail on Saturday. It is an early cutoff and soon will be no more..so there really is not a need for weekends. Also not only do some vendors take weekends off...you ready for this....we take weeks off sometimes!! Yes you read that correct..weeks! Now it all depends on the vendor and what he is selling..but a lot of us at some point will either be reloading on the goods or just need to take a week off to get everything straight. Or something will come up IRL. Also being&nbsp; a vendor takes a lot of time. As we are constantly answering questions from idiots like you. We have to answer all the messages from buyers that refuse to read the listings where their questions are already answered.. Or the questions where they ask about shipping and if you ship on Sundays, or they ask everything that is answered on your vendor page...again they don&#039;t like to read. Or they will reads where you say your cutoff time is 2pm PST...so they will then message you and say &quot; it is 1:30pm pst...I know your cutoff says 2pm but I am just checking if I out an order in now,,,will it still get sent out?&quot;&nbsp; The, with them being new...you waste your time and say yes it will be...and they will come back with &quot; Oh ok... I need to get coins then... I am not sure how long it will take to get them to my wallet...but I will probably just order tomorrow..thanks&quot; And in between those we have the legit questions (very few) and we have to deal with customers, orders, packaging,shipping, account maintenance ect. So as not to get burned out...or just to in general take a week off because we can...then a lot of us do. <br /><br />What is important for newbies to understand is that you need to read the vendors page. On it most vendors post daily updates and will give ALL the info you will need. I would say that 98% of ALL your questions are answered on the vendors page. So always go there. It is best that when you find a vendor you like that you &quot;become a fan&quot; why that is important is that it allows you to when you&nbsp; log in..to be able to see all the vendors that are your favorites(you became a fan) and you can just click on there name and you will be taking to their vendor page. You can find that option on their vendor page where it will say &quot;become a fan&quot; You just click it and you are then able to also see them if they go into stealth mode. If you are not a fan....then you will not see them. I suggest you read the Wiki page to learn more about that.<br /><br />Good luck!

				i slightly misspoke seems saturday delivery will be limited to some sort<br /><br />&quot;<br /><br />If the U.S. Postal Service stops delivering mail on Saturday, it will bring a small inconvenience to its business and residential customers but little real change to commerce and personal lives.<br /><br />We see the discontuation of Saturday mail service as being preferable to the agency’s making up the same ground by more drastic measures elsewhere.<br /><br />The USPS said its research shows nearly 70 percent of its customers agree with cutting back to five-day delivery as a way of reducing costs for the struggling postal service.<br /><br />Older readers may remember the days when residential mail deliveries were made twice a day — a practice that ended in 1950, according to Congress’ Government Accountability Office.<br /><br />We have no doubt postal customers in 1950 would have preferred to continue to receive two mail deliveries a day — but were able to adapt to the change. In the same way, 2013 postal customers should be able to adapt easily to losing Saturday mail deliveries.<br /><br />Much of today’s business — everything from bill-paying to job applications to income tax filing and much more — can be conducted by computer. Bills also are paid by many Lubbock residents over the telephone or by automatic drafts from their bank accounts.<br /><br />Personal communication among family members, friends and acquaintances is made by email, text messages, Facebook, Twitter, cell phone calls and other methods. The country is not going to come to a standstill if people stop getting mail on Saturday.<br /><br />And Saturday delivery will continue, to some degree, under the USPS plan. Packages will continue to be delivered six days a week, and Saturday mail will still be delivered to post office boxes.<br /><br />The USPS is a federal agency that gets no funding with tax dollars for day-to-day operations. Nonetheless, it is subject to congressional control.<br /><br />Congress has repeatedly declined to give its blessing for five-day mail delivery in recent years and has a ban on it in its appropriations bill. Postmaster General and CEO Patrick R. Donahoe said the USPS is making the interpretation it can make the change on its own because the federal government is operating under a temporary spending measure rather than an appropriations bill, according to The Associated Press. It will be interesting to see if Congress will allow that.<br /><br />In any case, the USPS needs much more than just cutting back on Saturday mail delivery to make ends meet.<br /><br />Donahoe estimates five-day mail delivery will save $2 billion a year. The USPS annual loss for its last budget year was $15.9 billion, and the loss was $5.1 billion the year before that.<br /><br />The postal service has little choice but to make some big changes, and cutting back on Saturday mail is an obvious place to begin.<br /><br />Because it is self-funded, the USPS has to live within its means, and that requires honest self-examinations and realistic adjustments. Congress and the rest of the federal government should take note.<br />&quot;

				Wow..So I hope you are high on your own supply and you are just replying so you too can get to 50! All these people come in here and just send stupid shit to get to 50 post so they can then not post in the next forums..or post there stupid shit?<br /><br />The funniest thing about all this is the forums are absolutely total shit! They went to shit a few months ago. There is more bad information in there then anywhere else. SO racing to get in there is pointless...there is no need to post anything..<br /><br />I actually left another message but I deleted it as it looked like I was taking a shot at you and the guy who was making the point about the USPS. When in fact I was not.. I went ahead and gave you all +1&nbsp; Good luck to all of you!!

				First you are from England or somewhere over there so I will give you a pass not knowing the definition of stalker.. or sarcasim&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Also as to why someone &quot; if&quot; you are deep in the game?&nbsp; If? Again it is your britt humor as I am not sure what you mean by &quot;deep in the game&quot; but if you meant &quot; Since clearly you are big time&nbsp; and have the best feedback, I have ever read, of any vendor on the road, why is it you are posting in here if you say the forums are so shitty and it is even worse in this forum&quot; Well if that is what you meant... it is because I was asked to make a few post for a moderator...So I did..then I saw the OP and I had to comment..then I saw that you were trying to just get to 50 post and you happen to be in the thread that I was asked to post in also..(I assume that&#039;s what you were trying to get across in your humor about a stalker) that I then responded, to your attempt, to not so much defend the OP but trying to get to 50 post...so I thought better of it and actually deleted my post and then made another post where I told you guys that I am the one who in fact gave all of you your first Plus Karma.. And then I was done..but then I refreshed and again I saw your post so I am here for the last time to address your last post and to give you yet another opportunity to not only show your great sense of humor but to also get that much closer to 50.<br /><br />Also you should be thanking me...because if I didn&#039;t come into this forum, to lay down some factual knowledge then you would have no clue that you indeed have to have your SR address in your signature so you can then, once you get to 50, go to the big boy forums to spam (I mean advertise) them with all your home made goods...as if you tried with out that..you would not only get your post locked..you could get suspended from posting for 2 weeks..that would not be good for someone like you that needs to get in there and spam/advertise so you can get business and actually sell some of your goods. I was sincere when I said good luck in that game... even harder for you not being in America.<br /><br />Also realize that no one cares about the use of their/there,they&#039;re (that one is NEVER used) though I appreciate it because I too hate when people don&#039;t use the right one :)<br /><br />And I do not look at these people as smoothcrothes, but again I will assume that across the pond that is HIGHlarious :)&nbsp; I just look at them the same way&nbsp; I do the&nbsp; 90% of posters in the shitty regular forums.....they do not know a thing about SR.... but act like&nbsp; and repeat the shit they read over in the big boy forums.. that in fact less then 5% of actual buyers post in the forums... Think about that number again...5%..that is the real number of actual customers that post in the forums.. when you log on next or even now..go to the bottom of the forums opening page and see the members that are actually in here.... you will see it is the same guys...and all they do is repeate there bullshit to each other...as a group they are totally crazy and paranoid....Also look at how small that number is(like 140 at best but usually less then 80)..Compared to all the buyers that are actually on SR(10,000). The truth is that the posters in the forums are not actually buying shit..yet they all claim to be EXPERTS on SR. What they are experts in is total bullshit and paranoia! As a whole they love to be paranoid..and they will make claims to things that are 100% not true...but they sound good..so they will then repeat it..<br /><br />But also there are some very smart people in here that really know their shit.. But I am only in here for the vendor only forum..and then I was asked to make a post in here...I did it..then I looked at a few other threads.. And in doing so I feel sorry for the newbs that actually are in here thinking they are getting good advice..when in fact it is total shit. They will learn soon enough.<br /><br />So I think I addressed all your questions..also you will soon learn that this is a small community..a and the vendors is even smaller....and the one thing we do is stick together as vendors.. So welcome.. I was totally talking shit in this post..but I was just kidding.. It&#039;s good that you do all that work yourself with your product you sell.... I do not partake in weed..but it seems you are completely organic...and I think you should market it that way...also take my advice from the other thread..do not give samples! It is a HUGE waste of time and energy and it does nothing for you ...even if you were doing so...so that you can then just charge them for shipping and this way they can then leave you feedback..it is a total waste..the feedback will not count..your % will still be shit..those people will NEVER buy form you. The point of giving samples away is to get business and to get feedback is the completely wrong way to go..And you can ask any vendor that is established and they will tell you the same thing.. Or you can listen the the number 1 marketing guy on SilkRoad as&nbsp; a vendor.. You just have to find him first. They call him one name..KING<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				this is a terrible thread. i assumed by drug dealers he meant irl who should be busiest at the weekend when everyone&#039;s partying not vendors on here who work similarly to ebay sellers. just don&#039;t think of vendors on here as dealers but maybe that&#039;s just me. <br />but yes self employed/criminals can work as many or few hours as they please ::) no employment contracts stipulating hours on here corrr blimey

				weird you say that, if you look through my past posts you can see i identified my dad as a sociopath and psychological abuser so i&#039;d have to disagree with you there from my personal experience. he didn&#039;t treat the dog well he just over fed her and locked her outside on a chain :&#039;(<br />still +karma to you if i didn&#039;t already for being a good dad!! make sure your kids know they&#039;re loved no matter what :)

				Good first post for me after about a year of lurking. Me personally I operate in a small town with little competition and plenty of addicts. I live about 7 hours away from where I do my dirt. I have a wife and two kids to be there for, I can&#039;t fuck around and serve all day everyday anymore and don&#039;t even plan to hustle much longer. I&#039;ve been going there in cycles for a few months now. For me the money is always there. I just keep up a good rapport with my heads (a lot of them are friends), and keep in touch with them while I&#039;m away and let them know I&#039;ll be back soon (never specify when exactly), that way I can get new phone numbers, updates on LE activity, snitches, and overall activity.&nbsp; I also read the news of the town religiously (politics, drug busts, etc.) to always keep myself informed even while away. I&#039;ve come to find that if you treat the custies like humans and show a certain level of respect and decency they&#039;ll always fuck with you (provided the product is still fire, even still I&#039;ve had plenty of my heads move straight up trash because they didn&#039;t wanna see me fall.). Basically take your breaks when you need them. Do not let the money or the addicts run you, you&#039;re already risking so much you deserve the breaks in between doing dirt. It also helps take the heat off of you. I&#039;d recommend not taking weekends off though if you don&#039;t have to, those are $$$$$ days.

				It is nice to put in a message they are gone or to go stealth but i don&#039;t blame them for taking time off. As long as they don&#039;t mark things in transit and sit on your order for a week, it&#039;s all good with me.

				Actually this was a hotly debated issue at the last annual conference of the IDDU (International Drug Dealers Union.)<br />Participants in a workshop that aims to Standardize Trading Drugs (STD) on a global basis voted for the following code of conduct in order to structure their workload with a special regard on various health issues ranging from <br />* lack of sleep due to long hours at all-weekend raves, <br />* strong headaches stemming from beatings during a raid by the local SWAT team and <br />* a deficit of fresh air because they were sentenced to the usual mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years because police could prove they had possessed 51 MDMA pills at one time.<br /><br />1) Written orders will be processed in the DMT (Dealer Morning Time) between the first line of breakfast coke and a good lunchtime helping of magic mushrooms.<br />2) LSD (Listing, Stocking, Deliveries) will only be done in the 2.5 hours before and after the daily 5&#039;o&#039;clock poppy tea as dealers have to pick up their kids from kindergarten like everybody else.<br />3) The conference also agreed on the MDMA rule which translates into &quot;More Dealing - More Assets&quot; and will allow STP (Super Trippy Purchases) in afterhours if the volume of the trade surpasses TMA (Two Million Afghanis.)&nbsp; <br />4) Rule 3, however can be extended to any hour if there is any involvement of 2CB (2 Cute Birds/Boys) since IDDU members have to use up all the generic Indian Viagra they cannot sell before the date of expiration.<br />5) A last special rule was introduced by the official association of SR vendors campagning for a 30-hour week (AoSRVC30H) due to the rapidly growing client base on SR: DOC (Discharge of Clients) if they think their 0.5g weed order will result in the same efforts during a dealers time off as if it were a multi-pound order.<br /><br />If you appreciated this piece - please Karma me&nbsp; ;D

				People like me come from nothing, we are what we&#039;re build and create. Without work and effort, we&#039;re nothing, and that&#039;s legit truth.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe in days off personally. I believe in supportive friends, loyalty and respect. If you call me at 2AM Monday morning example, don&#039;t excpect me to answer the phone, even though I always do. After months of working like this, if you use drugs, you&#039;ll burn out. The key is treat your drug dealing like a business, a trade, work. So maintain a healthy diet, get sleep when you can, and what I do is I lend out bud to good friends. When I need a good sleep, I take money off their bill and they run my business for a night.<br /><br />YOU can take days off. But in my opinion, your BUSINESS shouldn&#039;t :-) . Get workers, share the load :-)

				every day is a weekend if you have things set up the right way. <br />if you are risking life in prison by selling and STILL busting&nbsp; your ass working a 9-5 then you are wasting time. <br /><br />as far as taking days off from sales? absolutely not. <br />unless it is for a vacation, then someone else fills in for that week<br /><br />it depends on how motivated you are and what you are attempting to accomplish, i would say that more than half of those involved in the drug game have no business in it to begin with, but to each their own<br />

				Drug dealing is a business just like any other.<br />Think of it like this:<br />The government operates the public sector of the criminal industry, while we operate in the private sector.<br /><br />It is simple- In order to deal drugs, you need a business plan.<br /><br />I have one, and I assume most other vendors do as well.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />The Andromeda Group
