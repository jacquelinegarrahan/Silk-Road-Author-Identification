				It&#039;s been 2 days since received product from a vendor, which was massively underweight. Either he thought i was stupid and didn&#039;t have a scale, or sent me the wrong package. Regardless, he is not replying to my messages. I didn&#039;t FE thankfully, and there&#039;s 6 days til resolution, so what happens next if he continues to ignore me? Can I get all my money back?<br />Do I get the benefit of the doubt? I took pics as proof in case i need to. What happens in resolution?<br /><br />Sorry for all the questions guys, this is really pissing me off. I&#039;ve made over 15 purchases and this is the first large order I&#039;ve made, and the dude tries to fuck me over. I just wanna make sure this is gonna end up fine. Like I said, I didn&#039;t FE, so hopefully this turns out OK

				If you have not FE&#039;d I don&#039;t think you have anything to worry about. I would wait a couple of more days, maybe the vendor is flooded with messages and hasn&#039;t reached yours yet. If he does not respond you&#039;ll just go into resolution and I&#039;m sure the guys in charge will help you out and you&#039;ll have your money back. It still sucks that you didn&#039;t receive what you asked for but there are tons of other honest and helpful vendors in the road you can get what you want from.

				yeah, i heard this guy could be really unprofessional (and has pulled the same shit on other people), but my first experience went fine. <br />i should just stick with more trustworthy vendors, because not being in control of my money for 6 more days possibly sucks. <br />ah well, i&#039;m lucky to have not gotten scammed when i was basically required to FE on everything as a newbie.
