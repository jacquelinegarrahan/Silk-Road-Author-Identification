				<br />i like to roll blunts if im like 3 or 4 folk deep or riding around<br /><br />but any other time bho is the only way to go, all i&#039;ve smoked for quite a while now and all i really care to smoke.&nbsp; i love the ritual of dabbing and its the only shit that actually medicates me anymore, if i can&#039;t dab i can&#039;t eat, sleep, function in public, etc. due to various physical/mental issues.&nbsp; <br /><br />the only thing that i don&#039;t like about bho is that my friends and other people often can&#039;t handle it, it either puts them to sleep or they feel too high, which nobody likes lol..&nbsp; i only have one friend that can go glob-for-glob for me and we&#039;ll drop some serious loogies like the kind that make yr ass SWEAT b2b all nite, the kind that sink your battleship ya kno<br /><br />if you grow and you arent making bho w/ yr trim you are seriously missing out, i extract with a old topo chico bottle with the bottom cracked off and a hole in the cap, 20 bucks says you have something in your house right now that you could use to do it, just throw down for a can of tane and get down to business.. once again, i love the ritual of making bho as well.&nbsp; everything about it is just fun to me ya<br /><br />btw the captcha for this post was &quot;gaybbw&quot;

				I&#039;ve personally stayed from bho since the last time I smoked it. I coughed up blood, no joke. This was straight from the cannabis club &quot;medical grade&quot; and I don&#039;t think it was purged correctly. So my experiece is that while the high is typically much stronger, there&#039;s not much consistency with the extraction process that even the club vendors use so I don&#039;t trust like I trust some quality indoor. Personally, I&#039;ve totally bought into all the hype around Girl Scout Cookies, that&#039;s my preferred smoke for sure! Second to that is a quality OG cross.

				There was one place that used to sell super bomb CO2 extracts. The SkyJack was my favorite. It was a sativa dominant hybrid and contained 92% THC. Smelled like jack buds and hit super clean unlike some other extracts (likely due to butane purging) But now I have a connect for &gt;93% THC &quot;hash&quot; for only $35 grams. The reason i say &quot;hash&quot; is because its actually wax but the way the guy makes it puts it under the hash category (it isnt gas extracted but rather refined using many many different processes)

				I can&#039;t wait until CO2 becomes more common. No one seems to know how to purge the butane effectively. At least in my experience anyway. Has anyone heard of Ice-wax by the way? Not refined bubble hash but actual wax that uses an ice extraction process? A friend of mine picked this up recently and swears by it. I haven&#039;t seen it though so I can&#039;t verify...

They actually smell like the buds they were made from, and they dont have that heavy/harsh butane grab! Ive heard of this but im not sure if ive had it (my friends and I dab/smoke/vape a lot of different things so its fairly likely that i have) ill keep a keen eye out though&nbsp; ;)

				Also I stopped consuming butane extracts because a lot of recent research has been saying that it may contribute to heart problems, lung conditions, etc. I developed a gnarly cough for a bit when i was dabbing a lot for a good month, but after i eliminated butane extracts it improved significantly (im slightly athsmetic so ingesting any inhalants always leaves me with a slight case of smokers cough)

				wow tbh yall it sounds like what you got was badly purged iso, not bho..&nbsp; i know a lot of &quot;medical&quot; clubs sell qwiso as bho and just sell horrible concentrates in general, most of the worst bho ive had has been from dispensaries.&nbsp; i have also seen people cough up black/grey shit/bits of blood when smoking terrible qwiso..&nbsp; its kinda sickening really because bho, when purged properly (this is not something you need a vacuum to do btw you can purge EASILY using just heat), is very smooth and while it might get you coughin/sweatin it&#039;s actually much better for your lungs (from what i understand, i dont like to spread misinformation so if i&#039;m wrong call it out).&nbsp; really the worst that i&#039;ve seen happen due to a bad purge was a fat dab making crazy fireworks shot hot oil into my friend&#039;s eye..<br /><br />ice-wax, which is just real full-melt btw (no matter what anyone says, it IS bubble hash), is not going to be as potent as it would be if you&#039;d solvent-extracted the same material.&nbsp; that being said, it can still be very potent, but it won&#039;t hold its own against a real good oil.&nbsp; <br /><br />as far as co2, i&#039;ve had plenty of shit that people called co2 oil but i&#039;ve never seen anyone make it nor ever really been convinced that people are doing it a lot.&nbsp; the fact is, if you can get ahold of some n-butane and a nice extractor with a recovery system, what comes out is just as clean as any co2 oil would be (again my understanding), and co2 is much much more expensive and difficult to work with.&nbsp; i make my own concentrates all the time and the only special thing i do is use a micron filter instead of coffee filters, i have a friend who washes hers in denatured alcohol to get the last of the waxes out afterwards but i&#039;ve never really done this step because i don&#039;t like waiting for it to freeze, seperate out, etc before you can just drop a bhomb.&nbsp; and i get ooey gooey sap consistently that is smooth and dabbable all day long.&nbsp; <br /><br />its a bummer that yall have had such bad experiences with it.&nbsp; like i said, when done properly, there will be virtually no butane left in your extract, and doing it properly doesn&#039;t require anything special..&nbsp; you inhale more combusted butane when you smoke a bowl id think than you ever would dabbing and that butane in your bic is FAR nastier..&nbsp; i think there&#039;s a lot of misinformation out there about butane extracts, and extracts in general, and a lot of is fear-based because ppl think it&#039;s some wild new thing.. i know folk who&#039;ve been dabbing many times daily for 8 or 9 years and many, many others have been doing it much longer out on the coast.. and we&#039;re all doing just fine&nbsp; :)&nbsp; ymmv
