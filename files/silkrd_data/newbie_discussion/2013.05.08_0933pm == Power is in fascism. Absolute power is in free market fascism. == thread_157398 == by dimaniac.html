				Free market capitalism provides fastest economic growth possible. However free market capitalism is &quot;unfair&quot;, leads to extreme income inequality and destroys jobs through automation. Economic cycles produce unemployment which can lead to revolution, or redistribution of capital by the democratic government to create demand for excess human supply (e.g. The Great Depression). If being poor and unemployed was a crime then revolutions/redistribution of capital wouldn&#039;t happen. The first country to adopt free market fascism will experience huge economic growth because the bourgeoisie will be able to accumulate capital exponentially, and replace obsolete human workers with machines without any government intervention to protect the proletariat. In the end, such an economy will attain 90-95% of the world GDP. Everyone else will become mere natural resource exporters because keynesian/socialist/marxist economies won&#039;t be able to compete with free market fascism.<br /><br />Free market fascism comprises 3 social classes:<br />&nbsp;The 1st class(fascists) consists of people who guard and regulate the system, and protect the capitalists from jealous proletarians (the artificially created middle class in the USA). If there are elections within this system, then only members of this class can vote. Though consulting the capitalist class is still possible. 1 to 10 million people are needed for this class. Tax revenue (approximately 10% of the GDP) from exploitation of capitalists is distributed more or less equally among members of the ruling class. They are the shareholders.<br />&nbsp;2nd class(&quot;haves&quot;): capitalists, entrepreneurs, investors, speculators, lenders, rentiers, etc. Up to 1 million people.<br />&nbsp;3rd class(&quot;have-nots&quot;): proletarians, including highly skilled workers, scientists and intellectuals. They are needed in the beginning, but most of them will eventually be replaced with machines and AI. Up to 100 million people.<br /><br />&nbsp;Japan and Germany have huge economies, yet relatively small territories (less than 400,000 km2). In free market fascism a large population won&#039;t be needed either. A territory of similar size can be created (sea platform/artificial island), or the population of a country that nobody cares about can be displaced (Somalia, Colombia, Uganda, etc.)

				Any ideology that starts out: so there is this one group of people and then this other group of people....<br /><br />is not a good one in my book.

				I&#039;m pretty sure that anything that starts with &#039;Free Market&#039; but ends with some distinction of political bias (such as fascism) is not really a Free Market at all. It just means those in power are free to make whatever associations they like and force their decisions on the rest of us. Any truly Free system must be completely removed from politics and left to the individual to decide where/when/how they exchange with each other.<br /><br />As far as I&#039;m aware a system like that has never exited in my time. People are indoctrinated about the horrors of the free market but no one has actually operated in one - except underground. SR is a free market economy with no special favors provided from upon high. Exchanges are P2P and it&#039;s no one elses fucking business.<br /><br />If all private human exchanges could work like that *then* we&#039;d be closer to a free market. Whatever guise you hear about it today is anything but.
