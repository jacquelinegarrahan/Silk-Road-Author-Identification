				Over 2 weeks ago I ordered 3 items to my address, none of them came. I was under the impression that my post was now being monitored, and expected a police visit any time soon. I recently ordered another item which came! No signs of inspection or tampering, the package arrived perfectly and one day after being ordered. <br /><br />It seems my post probably isn&#039;t being monitored, as the package would no doubt be delayed if it was to undergo inspection. I know there has been striking action recently, which may have upset the flow of packages; my earlier packages my yet arrive soon. <br /><br />My advice is to order from vendors with maximum attention to stealth. Pm if you&#039;re not 100% sure. MrAnonymousX has excellent stealth, the kind all vendors should endorse here on SR. <br /><br />Be diligent, your address PROBABLY isn&#039;t flagged.

				All different. One was a legal RC address to my own name, which lead me to the idea that perhaps all my items got lost, as there WAS a large amount of striking that week. In 2009 a strike of the same nature cause millions of lost post.

				If they were all internal UK post it is highly unlikely they were intercepted, Royal Mail doesn&#039;t have the resources for that kind of surveillance.&nbsp; I reckon either the strike has delayed your post or the RM has delivered to the wrong address.&nbsp; My flats keep getting post meant for a similar address round the corner.

It depends on the evidence -- or lack thereof -- collated at the time. You cannot assume you&#039;ll get a cheery little letter each time your package is intercepted. If a package does not arrive then you&#039;d best investigate it and for fuck sake cease ordering till you find out. Could be a number of reasons, vendor OR 5-0. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Must be an issue with your address details or them not sending it. I&#039;ve not heard of any postal strikes.

				Maybe your postie has sticky fingers? No offense to the majority of postal workers who are straight and honest but there are a few rogue ones who&#039;ve been known to steal the mail.<br /><br />I&#039;m also UK but order my bud from overseas. Can get it from overseas vendors cheaper than in the UK online / offline. <br /><br />Woohoo my big five-zero post!

				I&#039;m in the UK but we don&#039;t have everything. For example THAT coke. If there is a quality one (I will try some of the UK vendors soon), then the price is stupidly expensive, and it&#039;s not worth the money, because the same quality (or even better) is cheaper from overseas. <br />And considering the fact, that the UK coke used to be crap, if somebody try a 40%-50% &quot;pure&quot; one, they think that now they have the real deal.<br />(Touch the wood I always received my orders without any problem:))

Look into it from your end, try and at what point it got held up (sometimes it is easy), why, and ascertain to best of your ability whose fault it was, yours, the vendor, or customs. And for pete&#039;s sake, don&#039;t re-order until you have figured it out and know what is going on. If your address is compromised you need to know as soon as possible, and no, it isn&#039;t always like tv where they proudly announce what they have on you the moment they have it. They often hold off to build a stronger case so bear that in mind.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
