				i think atlantis and BMR etc are just new players to the market. buyers will determine how much share of the market they get. it will depend on how dedicated to service they are. I don&#039;t fawn over DPR and her crew like many here do, but i invested a lot in becoming a vendor at SR. so what happens to SR, happens to me. so i defend SR not by promoting it or prosetylising, but looking for real solutions. What has happened to SR could happen to BMR or atlastis or any of the others. The weakness is not in their capability to provide secure and reliable service, it&#039;s the Tor software that the weakness exists. SR is just a tall poppy. I didn&#039;t have another option when i started up as a vendor, and it is in my interests that SR continues.<br /><br />so go use the other sites if you want to. there is no SR religion despite the way some folks talk. SR is just serious about the business and there is no viable alternative to Tor presently. This will change. and, as i say in my post here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155667.0<br /><br />these are the things you as an individual can do to support tor weathering this storm. take it or leave it.

				I happen to like the layout and speed of Atlantis , and I love that It always loads the first time BUT!!!!,, almost everything on there is more than SR!!, even from the same vendors?? i dont get it.. i do like that there is some type of alternative to SR with all the down time.. But i will always be a SR guy till its gone... 8)

				Atlantis is a very well-designed site. I hope it does well.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why people here don&#039;t maintain concurrent accounts on Atlantis and BMR, as well as the default of SR. The reason why SR is in constant jeopardy is because it&#039;s a single point of failure. An easy target. That also has a consequence of not providing enough of an incentive for the developers of Tor to prevent DDoS attacks using the protocol. But if there were multiple, large sites on Tor affected, then they would have to do something. Attacks would be much more difficult to launch because multiple targets are always a pain in the ass.

				by the end of the day, its all about business. One person wants to sell and another wants to buy. If you cannot do business here, it will go elsewhere. Ideals are good and loyalty too, but in the end of the day: everybody needs to do their part (sell, buy).

				I like SR because DPR is an anarcho-capitalist libertarian agorist voluntaryist type. I would rather stay here than go some other place where people don&#039;t fully understand why it&#039;s so important to create marketplaces that cannot be regulated by anyone other than the people who are in it and have a rightful stake in it. Such ignorance of the reasons for this marketplace as a social activism action will also mean they are possibly more pliable if they get caught and end up giving up the server database to LE.

				There is always a need for new innovations in any marketplace. Right now I would not feel comfortable anywhere else. But I&#039;m old, and set in my ways. Get the fuck off my lawn!
