				I was a bit weary when I received this vague response from someone who has great, awesome feedback.<br /><br />Considering that she has USPS priority shipping (two days to me on west coast) I figured it would be here in no time--regardless of any delay from tax season.&nbsp; I ordered at 4:45PM PST on Tuesday, April 10th, and it was marked as shipped by 10:45pm on Wednesday, April 11th.&nbsp; This is a 2-day postal service to me--has been ALL of my entire life. <br /><br />It is now seven days later from the day it was shipped (time enough for USPS media mail to have made it)--eight days from he day I first ordered.&nbsp; On her site it says that it could normally take 6-8 business days from the time ordered, which by my calculations would be this Friday at the latest. <br /><br />But if they were shipped last Wednesday, even Thursday, then by all means they should have arrived on Saturday.&nbsp; When I inquired into this, asking about when it was shipped, and how it was shipped, this was the vague answer I received:&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; Tax season is prolonging everything my dear . I am trying to make everyone happy but at the same time<br />&nbsp; we have also been closed down for maintenance as well.. Vendors have 17 days to reach you . In U.S that<br />&nbsp; is usually more than enough time. Just not lately.. my apologies . But this part is out of my hands. Read up<br />&nbsp; on Vendors and buyers handbook so you do have some worries eased. Many of vendors are all dealing <br />&nbsp; with issues lately.. But doing best we can. <br /><br />That seems pretty vague to me; does it to anyone else?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; I told her that her answer made me feel like my package hasn&#039;t even been shipped as of yet.&nbsp; Am I overreacting when someone tells me they shipped last Wednesday, meaning it would be here no later than Saturday-- of which never happened?<br /><br />She said she has 17 days for vendors to reach me--that&#039;s the SR &quot;law&quot;.&nbsp; I would think that if you say I send 2 day mail, then by the time you mark it as shipped, I have 2, maybe 3, days before it is here.&nbsp; And that is not what her information screen said, and it is not what I signed up for.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was willing to settle for 6-8 business days as a maximum.&nbsp; That&#039;s what she proclaimed.&nbsp; She is blaming it on tax season, yet today I received a priority mail package which was just sent Monday.<br /><br />Should I take this to resolve?&nbsp; Give it until Friday?&nbsp; Ask for her ability to make it right?&nbsp; A refund is the last place I want to go.&nbsp; I just figured, by her information available, that it would certainly be here by now--and if not now, then by Friday this week at the latest.<br /><br />I will keep you posted friends.&nbsp; And I would LOVE any feedback you can offer.<br />I appreciate your time in reading this.<br /><br />Warm Regards-<br />Dapper<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Later message I sent:<br /><br />I understand tax season, and I read all available information when I first joined years back. I&#039;m not looking for miracles, just honesty.<br />I guess I was hoping for (and yet didn&#039;t ask for) a more explicit response, such as:<br /><br />Your package was shipped via USPS _____ on the afternoon of April ___. If it has not showed yet, it is probably because USPS is overwhelmed right now. Keep me posted so we both know what is going on.<br /><br />Your answer makes me wonder if my package has even been shipped yet.<br /><br />-----------24-hours later-------------<br /><br />Just to note: package was a no show today either, although another priority package ordered just monday off of amazon arrived today without problem. Perhaps you haven&#039;t sent yet; I know you say 6-8 business days, which I was ok with when ordering, but knowing that mail seems to be running just fine, and reading that it was shipped as of last wednesday--well, perhaps you can see why I am concerned.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t shipped just yet, please reverify address before you do ship.<br />If you have shipped, please let me know when, if it wss indeed usps priority, and to what address.<br /><br />I feel like I just need to say, I am not angry. <br />I just like CLEAR, CONCISE communications, as I want to know what to expect.<br />These are the personality traits you claim to live by on your information page.<br /><br />As of now, I am happy to simply trust in your feedback and professionalism.<br /><br />Hope that you understand; I don&#039;t need a long reply--just the facts.<br /><br />With much respect and appreciation-<br />-adjunct

				Oh Cobia--please expound; I am really so, so curious to hear your input.<br />Of course no one is perfect--I certainly don&#039;t claim to be, any grounded person wouldn&#039;t, but I think we can all be upfront and civilized no matter what circumstances we are presented with.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on this situation?&nbsp; And just curious, what part of the world do you live in-- I&#039;m a sociologist and am just interested in your culture.<br /><br />Regards,<br />-adjunct
