				Was looking at the QP listing he has up for $750 and wanted to know if it was too good to be true (a scam) or too true to be good (mids/reg bud).... ANYBODY who has dealt with BudCentral before that could put me at ease will be repped (or given karma whatever u guys call it)<br /><br />Also the 50posts to get out of the newbie section is ridiculous given the verification letters that I have to put into a new tab every god damn post.... they should really lower it to about 15-20 posts, but that&#039;s just my opinion

				Do it, sir.&nbsp; I just received a lb from him and it was DANK.&nbsp; Also came in a reasonable time.&nbsp; He is certainly a legit vendor.<br /><br /><br />Some advice-&nbsp; order Trainwreck. The Cherryberry and Chemdawg are both getting a little bit of a bad rap because they are only in popcorn nugs (the Trainwreck has fat nugs). Also, the PK tends to be leafy but the FI is okay but it is grown outdoor I beleive.&nbsp; The Trainwreck is indoor and there are trichomes and the whole deal.&nbsp; Good weed.&nbsp; I have a review that I just put up earlier today and there are other reviews (one by Metaphoe, who has a very good reputation for weed reviews)<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160065.0;topicseen
