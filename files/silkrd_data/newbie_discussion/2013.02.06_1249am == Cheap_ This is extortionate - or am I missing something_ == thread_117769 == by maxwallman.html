				Hi all,<br /><br />Newbie here with a query. Having looked at some vendors pages, it seems the average price for a gram of weed is around 1.5 - 2.5 bitcoins. According to MtGox, a bitcoin is currently around £12 each. So 1 gram is costing around £18 - £30. This is NOT good value as far as&nbsp; I am concerned. The most I have ever paid for weed/hash is £7 a gram and that was for hand rolled Manali cream. Best quality bud is usually £5 - £6 a gram round here, and I can get good quality Thai on the street in Brixton for £4 a gram.<br /><br />My query is this... Am I missing something here? Is the current bitcoin exchange rate for 10 coins or something? I would love to use the services of SR, but if these are the prices then I can&#039;t afford to!<br /><br />Any comments welcome, and I hope I&#039;m not being a total dunce!! :-)<br /><br />maxwallman

				Prices are generally a little higher on SR and one must consider if the added anonymity and quality control is worth the premium....<br />

				buy more than 1 gram, u can get a oz of some stuff people would consider loud for 225 and a qp of the same quality bud from the same vendor for 720, im not giving any names cuz i want him all to myself but if you look around a lil more you can def find him. like you wanted lower prices so u could buy a qp from him,resell it a 10 a gram and make 400 profit,of course i always charge 15 a g and it gets gone quick as fuck in my town.of course diff vendors have diff prices,shop around,u can even get lbs for a few stacks of some nice ass dank.

				The prices seem on point for my area, but maybe a bit more due to the shipping and convenience. This is the price we pay for a marketplace that allows such a vast variety of things we want with ease. I cant knock it really.

				Ordering psychedelics is safer since they are odourless and a lot lighter. They also seem to be at or below street prices, especially when you consider quality control via feedback etc

				If you buy weed by the gram, then you must be okay with being extorted. If you are concerned about it, buy larger amounts and the price point drops.

				During high school I&#039;d pay 15-20 bucks a gram for hydro, but I was buying by the gram.<br />As people are saying, buy more for cheaper rates.<br />Weed is a difficult market to compete in.&nbsp; Everyone has it already, so you need either killer weed, or killer prices.<br />I like to think we have killer weed.

				Hi mate! When first I came in to the Silk road world, I though the same, but after some research I found fare prices,<br />just check the Lafuente vendor, he offer a 1/4 kilo for 250 and is good quality, just check, send messages to the vendors asking for bulk prices, MOVE!!!

				Well, thanks for all the replies. I realise that buying by the gram is going to be more expensive, but as a newbie everything says to start off with a small amount! I appreciate all the comments and will take a look at some of your suggestions. Having said that, I still think it is generally more expensive than what I can and have bought recently, but I accept that the quality is probably better and I am guessing that there won&#039;t be anywhere near as many sticks and seeds in the mix (well, I hope so anyway!). Personally, I smoke a LOT of weed, and have done so for 20 years, and I have had access to some fantastic stuff at well below these prices. Sadly though, that is npt the case any more and so I will just have to suck it see!!<br />Thanks again for the responses.<br /><br />maxwallman

				I guess the cool thing about the road is that you have access to strains that are not commonly available.<br /><br />Ive recently in my area come in contact with a supply of frequent high quality various strain buds, but it doesnt mean I wont order online from time to time.<br /><br />Feel it out man!
