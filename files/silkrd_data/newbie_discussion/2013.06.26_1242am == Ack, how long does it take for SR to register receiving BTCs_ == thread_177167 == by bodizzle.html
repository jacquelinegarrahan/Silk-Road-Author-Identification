				Once you have transferred them to your SR bitcoin address, go to blockchain.info and key in your SR bitcoin address and do a search, once there has been between 6 and 8 confirmations, it will appear in your SR account, takes roughly an hour.

				Does the admin have to manually send out bitcoins, or is there an autoscript? This is relevant to my interests.

				Ah thank goodness! I just bought bitcoins today for the first time and I&#039;m so nervous because I feel like so many things can go wrong! I buy drugs in real life all the time and this is so much more stressful haha.

				Keep checking blockchain.info (search your wallet address). If it&#039;s been a few hours there should be at least a couple confirmations. It seems like SR accepts bitcoins transactions at around 8-10 confirmations.

Some other websites similar to silk road show an &quot;unconfirmed balance&quot; and a &quot;confirmed balance&quot;. I wish silk road used this feature to give us some peace of mind that we didn&#039;t type the wrong address and lose $500.
