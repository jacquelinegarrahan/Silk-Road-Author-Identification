				Paypal is a terrible service, please never use them for anything! They are not a bank, and so is not regulated like one (read no FDIC backing). Instead they are regulated as a &#039;money transmitter&#039; and so you have much less protection as a customer. Paypal has many instances of seizing funds and accounts outright, just look at what happened to the wikileak donations. Also they have a long history of rolling over to the feds and are not to be trusted. Plus a 3.5% fee per transaction is fucking terrible. Just avoid using paypal all together.

Paypal is not to be trusted under any circumstances. The US govt lets them get away with much more than they should, so its likely they have an arrangement worked out. <br /><br />Plus paypal chargebacks SUCK!

				paypal is borderline, if not completely evil. they have identification requirements for registration, which would be necessary for at least the vendor for them to be able to accept payments. they are suspicious of various types of activity and thus turn over lots of info to the feds. they are bastards about chargebacks, holding the payee responsible when a chargeback has been requested by the credit card cos. (they did this to me when i sold a tuba on ebay. a few months later, paypal says i owe $600 because the CC co. suspected a fraudulent card was used.) and on top of all that, they seem to be easily hacked, judgeing by the number of stolen paypal accounts available on the black market.<br />so if your only problem is that you had a hard time buying BTC, then you should shop around a little more. BTC is not difficult at all to buy. if you have cash, try using a service like bitinstant, where you place an order, and go to an agent in person with your cash. an hour later you have BTC&#039;s in your wallet or your account or wherever you asked them to be sent when you placed your order. or you could register for an account at a currency exchange like mt. gox. you can fund your account from your bank and then buy BTC&#039;s on the open market, which is kind of cool i guess.<br />anyway, paypal is not good.

				LoL I do know this is BM. I just thought it would be easier to have immediate access to bitcoins especially due to the fluctuation of value. I know Paypal would be a no go option but I was venting when I posted. Did the whole BTC transfer thing and all worked ok. Just time consuming.

				And I agree that the easiest way is not the best way. I just use my PP account&nbsp;very rarely. Was thinking of eventually getting rid of it, but I need it for my Ebay.
