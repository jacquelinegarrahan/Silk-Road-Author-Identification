				Hey samcrow, I don&#039;t know if you are having a laugh or not. I agree all this post looks suspicious but I am really keen on selling very good products and build myself a reputation.<br />Yes Mate the cocaine comes from containers in southern Italy in paste just after getting washed with ammonia,very good to produce oxi<br /><br />
