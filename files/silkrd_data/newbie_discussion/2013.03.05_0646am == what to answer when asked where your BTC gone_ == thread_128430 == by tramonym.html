				how do they know that the transfer came from bitcoinfog?&nbsp; or instawallet, for that matter?&nbsp; they just see transactions from one btc address to another ... but those addresses aren&#039;t labeled as belonging to a specific service, as far as I&#039;m aware ...<br /><br />also, I don&#039;t think LE has any reason to ask you where you are spending your bitcoins, unless they are asking you due to intercepting a package or something.

				You should not say anything. Don&#039;t make it easier for them to bust you. Don&#039;t listen to their threats just SHUT UP. Never incriminate yourself, when they&#039;ll have enough evidence they could land you in jail without needing to question you. If they question you, that just means they know what you&#039;re doing but don&#039;t have enough evidence.

				Buying bitcoins is legal.<br />What you do with it is none of their concern.<br />Besides transferring bitcoins to SR tumbles them, they will not trace it.

				Lost it gambling online, fucked up my wallet password, owed a friend money and they wanted it in BTC.<br /><br />But as someone said earlier - DON&#039;T say anything but your name, address &amp; birthday. <br />Only go with the police if they arrest you on the spot.<br />&nbsp;Otherwise (if they insist) make an appointment to meet with you at the police station,with at least 24 hours notice. Once there respectfully decline to answer any questions and ask if you are currently being arrested for any crime? If they say yes, ask for a court appointed Lawyer. <br /><br />Only speak to the lawyer to say that you have nothing to contribute and when you are brought in front of the magistrate, do not make a plea of any sort and ask to have the police prosecutor release all documents and evidence to you regarding the case and sufficient time to personally review the case and seek further professional help.<br />If the crime is not violent and your not considered a flight risk, you should get a small bail and be able to drag out the proceedings for at least 12-18 months. During that time spend as much time researching every little inconsistency in the police evidence and make absolutely no comments to the police or the court appointed lawyer. The court appointed lawyer will usually try to get you to confess to something or plead guilty. So be careful and don&#039;t admit or deny anything until you have thoroughly researched every bit of evidence and your story corresponds with their valid evidence.<br />And remember - the only direction is misdirection :)<br /><br />If you talk to the police they do the exact thing to you and try and trick you to say things that will strengthen their evidence and give inconsistent statements, proving you to be unreliable and trying to cover up your crimes. <br />
