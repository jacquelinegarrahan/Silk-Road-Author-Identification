				I&#039;m wondering if you guys are finding it cheaper on SR than IRL. Obviously it will be easier to get better quality thanks to reviews and the forum, but how does the pricing stack up?<br /><br />I used to have a good connect to a grower where I used to live, he&#039;s sell me decent weed for about half off the regular marked price. But since I moved, all I can get it crappy low-quality hash that feel like it&#039;s been cut with petrol...<br /><br />Therefore&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I found SR; I am currently waiting on my first order :D<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty amazing, this world we live in, that we can order any drug from all over the world :O

				Phenomenally cheaper. The majority of things I find around here I can sell for double or more on the street and it still be considered cheap.

				Since the explosion of MDMA the quality has gone to complete shit. Everyone scoring whatever the hell they can find and paying 50-80 a gram. My guess is methylone. Haven&#039;t had anything decent in over a year. Few years back I could score fire for anywhere between 100-130 (considering I never bought more than say 5 grams at a time). I&#039;ve seen EU sellers as low as 20 or so a gram when you REALLY step up the scale of your purchase. Have an order right now at 60 a gram, reasonable considering the rave reviews are endless for this product.

				Depends on the product.&nbsp; Weed is much cheaper on SR than locally for me, whereas strangely, hash is not, I can pick up hash cheaper locally.&nbsp; Coke prices are also way more expensive on SR than IRL, and the quality I get locally isn&#039;t that bad, so I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on there.&nbsp; Molly is about half the price on SR as what I can pickup off the street, plus I at least have some idea what I&#039;m actually getting, so really it just seems to depend.

				Weed is $45 for 1/8 in my neighborhood. You get whatever the guy has. There&#039;s no such thing as picking strains.<br /><br />SR generally has higher quality weed at a higher price. That&#039;s cool with me.<br /><br />

				The prices around here for weed are about the same, but the quality is just a tiny bit better on SR. MDMA is WAY more expensive in my area than on SR or even compared to other areas in my country.

				Hash is around the same price here, but the quality on the SR is so much better!<br />MDMA is more expensive on the road and blotters are around the same price (except that I know it really is LSD when ordering)

				for me SR has waaaaaayyyyy lower prices for weed than IRL, the best value you get for weed in Ireland is 1000-1100euro for a QP which is like 1500usd, pretty crazy prices, hash is cheaper IRL though but the quality isn&#039;t as good (generally, can be some serious stuff around for pretty cheap at times), chemicals-wise the only one i really do anymore is ketamine, which goes at 50euro a gram IRL and 30euro on SR (and thats expensive as it goes on SR but whopper k, try out marcelketman&#039;s s+ K, its soooo good)

				Before I moved to this new city I could get high grade weed pretty cheap and molly a little cheaper than the road.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind the expensive prices on SR as long as it means I can get high
