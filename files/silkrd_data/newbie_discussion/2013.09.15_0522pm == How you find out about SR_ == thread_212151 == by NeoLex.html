				I looked for a completely anonymous browser (tor) and found it from the Hidden Wiki. It all started from there I suppose, I&#039;ve been lurking for a few weeks and decided to make an account ;D<br />~D

				I think I read a mention of this place in a news article early this year or late last. I found the URL quite easily, set up the Tor Browser and started researching Bitcoin and price fluctuations but didn&#039;t actually take the plunge before last week.
