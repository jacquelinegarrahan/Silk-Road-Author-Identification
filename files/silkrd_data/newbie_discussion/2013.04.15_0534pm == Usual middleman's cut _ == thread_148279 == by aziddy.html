				Here is the situation. I&#039;m one of the 2 persons but it&#039;s irrelevant and I&#039;ll try to stay objective explaining the situation.<br /><br />Person A lives in Europe, he buys weed on SR with his own money and have the weed shipped to his adress. A doesn&#039;t know much about the drug business and doesn&#039;t have many contacts who could buy him more than 2 grams at the time.<br /><br />Person B lives oversea, is good friend of A. He knows contacts where A lives who could buy in bulk/semi bulk. He doesn&#039;t have any money invested and is at no risk. His role would be to put A and dealers in touch.<br /><br />What B&#039;s cut should be on the profit ?

				Nothing? B is only referring A to a hookup. Aren&#039;t mates meant to do that? A is ordering from SR anyway. If he wanted bulk could he just not get it from here, no?

				this is one of those things I wish I learned from The Wire. they didnt explain the whole division of profits in the chain of commands with the street crews. i myself have a problem with this. situation completely different but i was wondering how to give someone referral money for a sale while still making a profit to not break even

				depends if you want to make money from your friend or not. could he not just *owe* you a favor? maybe repay you in kindness / booze / drugs whatever the next they see each other?

				You shouldn&#039;t be given anything IMO; You are just helping a friend out, by telling someone that they should go buy from this guy.<br /><br />Friends help friends out, if you don&#039;t be a greedy bastard and ask for something in return, your friend will probably help you out in one way or another.
