				i don&#039;t know where else to put this post, i&#039;m new to forums, but here goes, this was my nighttime experience with Lucydrop&#039;s mystical papers<br /><br /><br />10:20pm placed 2 alphas under tongue, very little taste<br />10:55 increase in general disorientation, my teeth feel smooth, music sounds more alive<br />11:10 feeling very clean, friendly acid<br />11:25 the giggles begin, colors appearing more excited, a bit of visual lag <br />11:40 butterflies forming in my stomach, metallic taste slightly apparent, happy headspace, trying to figure out how to turn on iTunes visualizer xD<br />12:25 colors have become much creamier. i mean creaamiieer<br />12:25 - 2:25&nbsp; contemplations on life<br />3:45 - 5:15am playing a point and shoot video game, laughing a ton<br /><br />all in all very clean lucy, very little nausea throughout, easy sleep afterwards. thank you lucydrop.

				Thanks for reporting your experience. I am planning on shopping from this vendor myself. Question: Would you say you tripped hard with two hits, or could you have gone for more? I like to trip pretty hard, so... Also, how long did it take for you to receive it? Was it overall a smooth experience, would you recommend it? Thanks in advance.

It&#039;s hard to define &quot;tripping hard&quot; as it is different for everyone. Two hits provided a really fun psychedelic time, but I was by no means &quot;in another plane of reality&quot; or &quot;becoming one with the universe&quot; xD. If you want something more that speed, &gt;300ug is often needed, but since this was my first time with Lucydrop&#039;s product, it is smart to first get your feet wet and see how you personally like it.<br />...As for shipping, it was 10 days to the southwest US, Lucydrop answered all my questions and came through beautifully. If you can handle the added stress of finalizing early, I would highly recommend.

				Lucydrop lsd is very good, their dosage is accurate, i have shopped from that seller a few times, my girl tried lsd for the first time , first drug she ever took, and i first gave her half a tab, and she did fine, laughed&nbsp; a lot, a little euphoria, and very light visuales. A week ago we took 1 tab each and we had such a great night, visuals were present for almost 5 hours.<br /><br />I would recommend those tabs for real.

This reduces the risk that the vendor will not be paid by a buyer claiming that they didn&#039;t receive the product. With less chance of being scammed by a buyer, a vendor is then able to keep prices lower for the customer. However, there is always the chance that the vendor will leave town with your money and not ship the product. That is why many people advocate not using FE and instead remaining in the silkroad escrow system throughout the entirety of the transaction. It&#039;s a bit of a balancing act on how much you trust your vendor and their track record.

				Thanks for your review Billiken. It is much appreciated. Did you guys trip hard with the one tab, or was it just enough for minor visuals and stuff?

I think FE makes sense in that case. So many people that are looking for a quick fix or whatever would just get the drugs and not pay (unless they&#039;re planning on returning). However if the vendor gets paid but doesn&#039;t send the product, they will get negative feedback and therefore hurt their business big time.

				We where 3 people who did 7 hits each, put up a projektor and watched dredd...<br /><br />I tell you this my friends, it was the single most awesomme experience of my life, sitting there scremming at the screen as images changed due to lsd or visual effects and my mind blown, the only bad side is that all other movies are NOT dredd and you are not on lsd while watching them&nbsp; !<br /><br /><br />It is a lot to take, but if you are experienced and around good people there really is no worries, i am getting more as soon as the bitcoin price drops a little :D<br /><br />Good luck to you all, and lucydrop, who ever you are you are one cool banana !!<br /><br />

				I took 3 3/4 tabs and didn&#039;t get any visuals :|.&nbsp; It was a good experience but I&#039;ve had way better acid.&nbsp; Overall I&#039;d recommend Lucydrop as he&#039;s a good vendor with good prices.&nbsp; If I had weed I probably would have tripped harder.

				Do you have a high tolerance, perhaps? Cause LD&#039;s tabs were tested and they really are around 100ug. Taking as many as you did technically should have given you visuals.

				Body high fer sure, but mostly it&#039;s a headspace. In the right set and setting, I open up to the universe and feel love for everybody and anything, like a spiritual orgasm. An overall electricity that massages my body mind and soul all at once. I don&#039;t know, I&#039;ve never really described tripping before...<br />I use to wonder if maybe I was interpreting my visuals wrong, or something. Then I smoked DMT and had my first fullblown visual activity on a psychedelic. I&#039;ve never even come close to anything like that on shrooms or Acid.

				Delivery: (10/10) I ordered 25 hits of Lucydrop&#039;s alpha centauri LSD and received them in about 6 days, which is pretty good considering it was Canada to Northeast US. <br /><br />Service: (10/10) Service was great. I talked to Lucydrop before ordering and he seemed like a nice dude with a good cause. He was very helpful.<br /><br />Stealth: (10/10) Couldn&#039;t see anything going wrong with the letter. Stealth was great. <br /><br />Product: (9/10) The first time I took a tab of Lucy Drop&#039;s LSD I had a tolerance from doing 25i-nBOME earlier in the week so I can&#039;t comment on the strength. I gave a tab to a friend, and two more friends split a tab in half. It was definitely good clean L, my friend who took a whole tab said it was pretty potent from his past experience. As for the other two, they had a good time on half a hit. No real visuals, but what can you expect from one hit? I don&#039;t feel like going in depth on it&#039;s effects. If you&#039;ve taken LSD, you know what it does. The friend who took one hit wanted to buy two tabs from me, but I just gave them to him for his birthday. He was very happy about it. <br /><br />One week later I took another tab before going to a Shigeto show. It was definitely more effective this time around but I think I still had some tolerance from tripping three times the previous week. Still, I connected to the music to the point of pure ecstasy at times. It was at an art exhibit, so the visuals mostly consisted of added depth and texture on paintings which I enjoyed a lot. <br /><br />Next weekend I will be taking 3 of his tabs, this time with 0 tolerance. I will update after this time.
