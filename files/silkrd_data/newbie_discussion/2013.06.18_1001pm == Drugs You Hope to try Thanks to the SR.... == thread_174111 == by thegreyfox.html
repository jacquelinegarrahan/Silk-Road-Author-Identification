				The name says it all... we&#039;re (presumably) all SR newbies here; so, what do you hope to try that isn&#039;t around your hometown?<br /><br />I never have had ethly ether or tried GHB (I am not a rapist... i&#039;ve heard GHB is a hell of a drug... I also want to try a Roofie... I&#039;m going to stop before I get labeled &quot;thegreyrapist&quot;. Ha. There is actually Rx GHB... it&#039;s called Xyrem and is used to treat narcolepsy, I know for sure, and other things most likely too). Speaking of Rx pills... I would love to try a Desoxyn and if they still exist, a Q&#039;Lude. Speaking of ether, despite living in the south, I&#039;ve never had moonshine. I also want to FOR SURE have plain PCP (done 3-MeO-PCP plenty, and had laced weed when I was 16... only logical explanation for the effects and the appearance of the weed was PCP). Other than that, I&#039;ll be trying all the different RCs that are out there thanks to &quot;TIHKAL&quot; and &quot;PIHKAL&quot;; I should print the table of contents from each book and start striking off things I have done. Why was no &quot;Arylcyclohexylamine I Have Known and Loved&quot; ever published. I love me some dissociative bliss....<br /><br />So, let us get our post counts up and inspire some vendors to fill holes in the supply of the SR!!!<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				Marijuana mostly, it&#039;s something I know I like, isn&#039;t overly expensive, is completely natural, and I know I can pretty much handle without getting in too deep. Beyond that might like to try some shrooms some time. Interested in coke possibly but at this point I just think it would be a bad idea; I might like it too much.

				2C-B!<br /><br />I smoke pot every day, and I&#039;m currently growing some Koh Sumoi &#039;shrooms right now. My wife and I both think that MDMA is what drugs were intended to be like, and we&#039;re looking forward to finding some REAL MDMA, but of all the phenelymines he synthesized, Shulgin&#039;s favorite was 2C-B... so I&#039;ve been lookin&#039; for it on and off for many, many years.<br /><br />Bless SR for allowing me that opportunity!

				50th post, hurray. I came here for cannabis mainly, as I wouldn&#039;t wipe my ass with most of the shit on the street here in Ireland. Also interested in trying some psychedelic&#039;s, namely shrooms, lucy and 2cb possibly. Also, recently came across a vendor selling peyote which would be interesting to try and something I would definitely never get to try if not for this wonderful place.

				i spent more than 15yrs trying to try every drug i could get my hands on, uppers, downers, laughers, screamers, etc. and there are only a few left i haven;t sampled... GHB and Ether are 2 of them. after the first 10yrs or so i realized uppers just arent my thing, perhaps as my personality calmed down some, so there are a very small handful of other drugs (mostly RCs) i havent tried, like methylone, that i dont have much interest in.<br /><br />but yeah.

				Why is it that many people are so aversive to psychedelics but would take much more lethal drugs in a heartbeat. If you have never tried psychedelics I suggest that you do. Its not nearly as scary as it seems. Perhaps start with mescaline, very few people have a bad trip on mescaline, at a low dose it feels like a much cleaner version of MDMA.

Stuff has to be above 70% pure. I&#039;m Rx&#039;ed 20mg of OxyMorphone a day and IV it. Local BTH from the &quot;Mexicans&quot; is a waste of money. I&#039;ve shot a gram of dope in my neck trying to OD and lived (fuck, had to go get a haircut 30 minutes after, so my lawyer could work his magic in court)... that&#039;s the level of tolerance we&#039;re talking about. &quot;subsrgood&quot; begged me not to shoot 100mgs at once. Luckily, he sent me 160mgs when I only ordered 100mgs. So, I tried 25mgs. Whoa... I felt it. I thought I was like immune to dope except for Oxymorphone honestly. I had said if god came down and said, &quot;Foxy, tomorrow I will erase either OxyM or H forever. You choose which one stays...&quot; that I would instantly pick the OxyM to survive. Now, the fact the OxyM is legal is the only thing that makes it different from H (at least the H &quot;subsrgood&quot; has). Trust me, I&#039;m the Junkie King....<br /><br />DMT= Ringo Deathstarr<br />Heroin= subsrgood<br />Phenatylamines/Tryptamines/Arylcyclohexamines= silo (well, soon... his expanded product line is coming out soon)<br /><br />I used &quot;bcpltd&quot; for Coke... but he lacks the customer service the above vendors have... I got frustrated waiting (FE&#039;ed early on Friday AM... didn&#039;t ship until Monday AM), and took too many Klonopin and Somas (like 10mg and 1.75g at once, then kept going...) so I was gone when the stuff showed up. Can&#039;t comment honestly...<br /><br />I need &quot;bellringer&quot; quality Coke. Anyone have any suggestions?<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy
