THIS is your attempt at busting someone?! ;D I&#039;m not normally one to taunt the enemy but your stupidity and blatant lack of pride in your work is offensive. I don&#039;t agree with what you do but fuck, if you&#039;re going to do something do it right! You should be ashamed to call yourselves police - the kid next door could do better, and he&#039;s 4 years old.<br /><br />Now go away, or I will taunt you a second time.<br /><br />Libertas

I think you are a human being, albeit a particularly dull one that works as a government thug and interferes with people&#039;s natural right to put whatever they wish into their own bodies. You are, perhaps, socially conditioned to think that what you are doing is &#039;right&#039; and &#039;just&#039;, but the law of man CANNOT supercede the law of nature. Try controlling the elements to see just how futile that is.<br /><br />If you wish to search for domestic weed vendors in your country, set your location to &#039;Israel&#039; and tick the &#039;domestic only&#039; box. The tactics you are employing are LAUGHABLE. I really hope your supervising officer doesn&#039;t see this. I mean I really, really do; demotion is on the cards for you, and possibly a bulletin put out to all members of your agency letting them know that you gave yourself up within two (yes, read it: TWO!) posts on this forum. Better luck next time.<br /><br />Locking this as an answer to the OP&#039;s query has been given.<br /><br />Libertas
