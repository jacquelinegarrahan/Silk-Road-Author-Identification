				Two weeks ago I went on SR looking for some decent bud from a respected seller. I thought I found it but ended up having the worst buying experience I&#039;ve had so far. I read through here, SR forums, and his seller profile and it seemed pretty good. People say they get their bud within 2-3 days of shipping. His profile says processing takes about 1-2 days. Everything seemed legit so I put in my order for a HP of blue dream. This begins the shitty past week.<br /><br />I put my order in on Wednesday. Thursday and Friday pass and it&#039;s still in processing, haven&#039;t heard from him but I thought I&#039;d give him some time. Half way through Saturday still nothing so I send him a message asking when it&#039;d be shipped. No reply at all, he logs on every day and doesn&#039;t read his messages. Monday comes and I can finally cancel my order, I try logging on and Tor and SR are being weird but I finally get on after about 15 minutes to find my order marked in transit. Shit, but that&#039;s better than nothing I guess. So I send him more messages asking for a response and when I could expect to receive my package, still nothing. The week goes by and I&#039;m just being hopeful that I&#039;ll receive it soon but nothing comes. I keep messaging him and he doesn&#039;t bother to read it. Until finally today, 9 days after I put in my order, I get one message: &quot;im send ing out ord4r today&quot;<br /><br />This means a few things: 1. He marked it in transit to keep me from cancelling my order. 2. He kept my information for a week and a half!! That is a huge NO in my book. 3. Either he kept my information or he just lied about sending the order. Either way he is in the wrong.<br />He offered no explanations or anything, I can only assume that he ran out and made me wait until he got more.<br /><br />BUT, this shit keeps going. I think whatever, I&#039;ll just leave him a bad review when I finally get my bud. Days pass and still no package. I send more messages without receiving any replies, even though he still logs in. It is now Wednesday, 2 weeks after I put in my order, 9 days after marked in transit, and 5 days since I was told that he was actually shipping it, and still no package.. <br /><br />Fuck this guy, for real. I asked to cancel my order and he told me that he was too busy. I don&#039;t know why he&#039;s even selling if he doesn&#039;t have time for it. There&#039;s so many things wrong with this guy and he needs to be kicked off of here for forcing me to be stuck with him and storing my information for almost 2 weeks!<br /><br />I don&#039;t want anything to do with this guy anymore, I&#039;m kinda glad my package has not come because I just want my money back. Apparently his &quot;Indoor&quot; Blue Dream, is full of seeds and was grown outdoors. I don&#039;t know why people are still buying from him, he&#039;s lost all my respect and I&#039;m pretty sure many more will follow.<br /><br />I have been out $1500 for 2 weeks now because of this guy and I wish I could make him pay for all the time he&#039;s wasted, but honestly I just want my money back now. I will be resolving my order once SR is back online.<br /><br />To anyone even considering buying from this guy DO NOT DO IT! Unless you like overpriced bad quality weed, next to 0 communcation, and have 2 weeks to waste, I would strongly advise you buy from someone else!<br />
