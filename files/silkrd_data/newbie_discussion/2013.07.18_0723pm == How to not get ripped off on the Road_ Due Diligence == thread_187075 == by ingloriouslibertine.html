				Cross-posting this here because new users are the ones targeted by FE scammers:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187068.0<br /><br />At a glance, there doesn&#039;t appear to be too much to raise suspicion, other than the length of time this guys has been on the road for.&nbsp; As you start to look deeper, the prospect of doing business with this vendor seems to become more and more risky.<br /><br />Take your time and assess all information available before deciding to go with a vendor you haven&#039;t used before, particularly ones that require any kind of FE.&nbsp; There are plenty of vendors on the road with a lot of good feedback who don&#039;t require FE, and it is well worth the little bit of extra coin to go with them.&nbsp; If you do find yourself considering a vendor who looks somewhat sketch, do every bit of digging you can, and under no circumstances should you ever order from somebody whose name yields no results when searched on the forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is also a great example of how little the current feedback system matters.&nbsp; Feedback alone is never enough to place your trust in a vendor, it is just one of several methods you have to try to gauge the risk factor in dealing with a particular vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the off-chance that this very sketchy looking new vendor does turn out to be legit, this is still a good example of how a few minutes of scrutiny can potentially save you money on your travels down the Road.&nbsp; Best of luck!
