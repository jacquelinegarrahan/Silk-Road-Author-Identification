				Newbie in more ways than one I guess...<br /><br />So I haven&#039;t been on the scene for a few years in Australia. Wanting to dip my toe back in the water and there&#039;s a lot fewer pills floating around than before. On SR I see that the majority of vendors are selling crystal MDMA rather than pills - not that this is a problem, I&#039;m sure crystal MDMA is a better bet than a dodgy pill that could contain god knows what. Still, got no idea about this stuff. The most reputable vendors sell a gram of crystal MDMA (80% purity) for about 1.5 bitcoins. Questions: <br /><br />How much mileage do you get out of a gram of 80%+ crystal MDMA? A big night out for how many people? I understand that YMMV but approximates are welcome<br /><br />How to take the shit? Crush and snort? Bomb it? Stick it up your arse or shoot it up (not really interested in these last two options)? How much would you hit to get you started?<br /><br />Cheers for the guidance folks

				Hey meta,<br /><br />I like to take 150 mg of crystal to start, and possible another 50 mg 1.5 hours in to extend the experience.<br /><br />One gram of crystal should be a hell of a night out for 5 people.<br /><br />Normally the crystal is crushed into a fine powder, and rolled up in thin paper or rolling paper to be swallowed. When I was in OZ we called these paper pingers.<br /><br />If you want to be brave you can stick it up the bum, this would extend the gram into ten doses since your arse absorbs it much better. You would have to crush it, put it in warm water, put that in a syringe with no needle, and squirt it up your brown eye while you lay on your belly.

				The proper safe dosage for mdma is 1.5mg per kg of your weight. So that will tell you how far it will go.<br /><br />As far as ROA, You can plug if your cool wit that, ive heard it prob the most effective ROA. Not my thing persoanlly.<br /><br />You can parachute it, with a joint paper, or tissue paper. <br /><br />You can theoretically snort it, but its not recommended, its not as effective and hurts like a bitch.. Its like you only trip in your face,lol.<br /><br />Last but not least, the most common ROA, oral ingestion. Some people can handle the taste and eat it raw, if thats not you, than cap it in a gel capsule. <br /><br />Hope that helped.

				Hey,<br />I would not recommend redosing. Take what the trip gives you and accept it. I would drop between 100 and max 200 mg. To get it in your body I would roll it into a little piece of cig rolling paper and swallow it with a bit of water.<br />If you wonder how you dose it properly, put the gram you have on a card and devide it into 6-7 almost similar pieces. By that way you should obtain probably 100-200mg trips. Greetings

				Well, then calculate your dose dependant on your weight. I did it for 100kg since it is my weight. Anyways measuring it with your eye is possible. If you do need .1g because your weight is about 60-70kg then you just do 10 or 11 equal parts. Take a mirror and a few cards and after 10-20 mins the lines you made should be almost equal.

				Oh and a gram should be enough for about 5-8 people dependant on their weight. I usually trip with .5 with 3-4 friends.

				Nice. Sounds fun. I reckon I could swallow it raw. And a mate of mine from London (where he reckons it&#039;s all liquid MDMA) says the worse it tastes, the better it is. Even if that&#039;s bollocks (and there&#039;s a fairly good chance it is), it&#039;s probably worth putting stock into anyway. Good to be in a positive frame of mind when you&#039;re waiting for the high to kick in.

Anyways, read a bit about MDMA in the drug safety area and use the search function feeding it with &quot;neurotoxic&quot; as search term. You will find a lot information by that. Good luck and stay safe.

				You can crush it up and put it into a drink of water if you don&#039;t like the taste. Personally I can handle the horrible taste, so I&#039;ll just rub it into my gums and under my tongue. Not sure if that&#039;s healthy for my gums or not :/

				Mate if you are dilluting in water and taking it oral, you are only expanding the volume of nasty taste!<br /><br />Put it in some strong fruit drink!<br /><br />If you could dissolve it in a shotglass, you wont taste it to much.
