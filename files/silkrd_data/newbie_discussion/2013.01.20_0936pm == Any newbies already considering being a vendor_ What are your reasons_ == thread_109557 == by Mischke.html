				Just give a list of why you are thinking of becoming a vendor. I&#039;ll start.<br /><br />1. I find it absolutely criminal to outlaw the exploration of consciousness. Any way I can to help others understand existence better is effort well spent.<br /><br />2. I find the entire SR process incredibly interesting - cryptography, infosec, fighting the man.<br /><br />3. Learning to protect your information and privacy is something that will become increasingly salient as the 21st century progresses, especially if the shit ever hits the fan.<br /><br />4. Earning a bit of money is always fun.

				It would be really nice to quit the day job and run a lucrative mail order company from home, but I don&#039;t think I have the balls to get involved with large amounts of drugs or selling stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;d be lying if I said I wasn&#039;t tempted though.

				Yeah, I hear you. But the thing is it&#039;s probably easier to get a stable, well-paying job with lower risk to your freedom.

				1. I am unemployed, and post-secondary education is exorbitantly expensive. I&#039;m a math major, in case you were curious.<br /><br />2. I&#039;m bored, and have a lot of time on my hands. What better thing to do than stick it to the Man?<br /><br />3. I object to the mainstream culture pushed by my country&#039;s elites, that unprovoked war against smaller countries is somehow just, yet enjoying life as I see fit in the privacy of my own home, on my own land, harming no one, is the business of the State. Fuck the police!<br /><br />4. Drugs are expensive, and vending allows me to afford buying drugs by the kilogram, which makes them more affordable.

				I have access to an excess of certain things that are less desired amongst my people which I&#039;d be willing to share with others elsewhere.<br /><br />But honestly, I don&#039;t trust my attention to detail to keep things safe enough for potential customers, and I could see getting greedy really quickly.

				I am a vendor and my sig shows the link.&nbsp; I get a rush offering financial services because the punishment is fierce and yet it doesn&#039;t bother my conscience. The combination gives me a sense of satisfaction.&nbsp; I love hearing the words &quot;Not Guilty&quot; in the courtroom.&nbsp; Music to my ears.&nbsp; I get to hear this sweet music every fucking day.&nbsp; I love my job.

				I feel that the thought of selling is tempting but, I figure being a middle man for your friends is good enough, skimming 10 bucks here and there to help build funds.

				Me. Selling shards of high-grade Crystal Methamphetamine. It took a loooong time but I believe I&#039;m plugged in to the &#039;heavy weight players&#039; now and I can buy a ball and start selling it by the point. {100 mg bags}.

				It is a nice idea, but it is of concern to me that a trail might be left when converting bitcoins to money, hard as I would try to conceal it!
