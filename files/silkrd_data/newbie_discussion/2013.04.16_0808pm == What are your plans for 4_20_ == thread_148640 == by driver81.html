				Howdy guys, I&#039;m driver81. The name&#039;s pretty ironic considering I can&#039;t drive for shit and I wasn&#039;t born in &#039;81.<br /><br />I&#039;m making my first thread to ask you all what your plans are for National Pot Smoking Day, the 20th of April. This year in particular I&#039;ve noticed a drive for public smoke-ups to highlight the pro-cannabis agenda, especially since the legalization of weed in Colorado and Washington. In the capital city of my home country, there is a massive smoke-up and walk-about planned, bigger than any others.<br /><br />Any of you guys thinking of attending one of these events? Or are you just gonna get high?<br /><br />I myself am planning a little camping trip in the woods with lots of hash brownies, a nice variety of herbal strains, and about 10 mates. Perfect as far as I&#039;m concerned.<br /><br />Safe&nbsp; 8)

You don&#039;t need anything other than mates and some quality bud. That said, papers and a lighter helps&nbsp; :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148640.msg1022274#msg1022274">Quote from: Dreamwolf on April 16, 2013, 08:12 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Don&#039;t smoke often.

I had this great time playing Dragon Age: Origins just eating loads of left-over cannabutter birthday cake, managed to crack through almost all the dwarven missions (including the deep roads). If you haven&#039;t played it, it&#039;s normally so long and boring, but in the place I was - pure fantasy beauty&nbsp; :)

				Going to a friend&#039;s birthday party, getting drunk, and hopefully fucking a busgirl. Which, in my opinion, would be an adequate alternative.

Male-female attraction has some general rules, but no specific algorithm that if done will guarantee one having sex.<br /><br />Personally, I read a book called The Game by Neil Strauss and read around the Seduction section of Reddit, but the only thing that will make anyone better with seduction (or any skill for that matter) is practice.
