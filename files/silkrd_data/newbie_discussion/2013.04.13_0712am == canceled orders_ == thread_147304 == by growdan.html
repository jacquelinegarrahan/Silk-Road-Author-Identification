				Yes, there are some vendors who have been cancelling orders due to the fluctuating value of BTC. Not much you can do really; hope you didn&#039;t lose too much. :(

				Well there were some serious questions about his MDMA recently, so if that&#039;s what you were ordering it might be a good thing that he cancelled.

				Don&#039;t feel too bad, I have a vendor who has decided to not cancel my order, but also refuses to accept it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just hanging there so even though he still has live auctions and logs in every day.&nbsp; I suspect since Bitcoins were worth $230 when I placed my order he is simply going to leave it there for 4 days before I&#039;m allowed to cancel it myself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Very, very dirty.

				Vendors who have their orders &quot;unhedged&quot; are cancelling them after the BTC exchange rate plummeted because they would take a loss if they shipped product worth less than the BTC they receive. Thus, the buyer takes the loss by receiving the lower valued BTC back. I personally lost half of what was in my account because a vendor did this.
