				If you want to sell your pills please present them in an acceptable manner. I don&#039;t believe many people will be buying your pills when they&#039;ve been poured out for display on a filthy piss-stained couch cushion. Yes, I actually saw this. It&#039;s also not cool to hold them in your sweaty hand and snap a photo of it. Basic hygiene matters.

				I 2nd that emotion. <br /><br />While we&#039;re at it, might as well cover the lackluster out of focus ones, with bad lighting. Some look like they were taken with a Palm Centro, or some other low mp camera/phone. - Especially when the pills are in blisters from overseas, where I, the customer, would want to actually see what it says. <br />Especially if your ad makes no mention of the brand. (usually means paki&#039;s &gt;:()<br /><br />Also, is it just me, or do all the pictures on Atlantis seem like they&#039;re higher resolution? <br /><br />One last thing? If you&#039;re using a stock photo, at least say so. Say, &quot;exactly like the ones in the picture&quot;. <br /><br />No picture? - I move on.

				That is the beauty of the road. The sheer number of vendors gives the buyer the ability to to be picky and reward those sellers who know what the people want. Its a buyers market, not the other way around.

I don&#039;t know if it was truly piss stained but it was filthy and you could see where liquids had been spilled on it. Like I&#039;m going to put THOSE pills in my mouth.

				A buddy is a pro photographer and his advice for anyone is to take the photo in natural light! Also, use some nice clean A4 paper to carefully lay the product on. Write your vendors name also.<br /><br />A lot of people take photos of products indoors leading to some grainy photo in which you could not tell a xanax from an MDMA tablet. <br /><br />Traders should make the effort to get a decent product image sorted out.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to strip the meta data before you upload.<br /><br />Here is an onion image uploading site so you can upload photos (vendors can upload via SR but buyers need an alternative) ....<br /><br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/<br /><br />

				If your product is white, try laying it on a (clean) wooden table. There&#039;s something slightly charming about vendors who go the extra mile to make their photos look nice!

				Just borrow an I-Phone or one of the newer droids.? HTC/Samsung etc. Some photos I see from those cameras look pro. <br /><br />(also helps to wipe the lens!) ;)<br /><br />
