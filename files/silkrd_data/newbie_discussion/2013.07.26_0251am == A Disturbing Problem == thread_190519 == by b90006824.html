				&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi Everyone, I know this is my first post on the forums, however I have the same name as a buyer on SR and I&#039;ve completed just shy of 30 purchases successfully, all around 1btc each in the past 9 months. So I&#039;m not quite a newbie to the marketplace.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Among my orders are, many for MDMA, a few for MDPV, some Xanax, NBOME, and MXE. I have a good idea of what good product is, and I&#039;m not some newbie that&#039;s trying MDMA for the first time and just freaking out about the roll.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;here&#039;s the problem. I ordered a gram of MDMA about 2 weeks ago to split with a very good friend of mine, who is far more experience with MDMA than myself. She has rolled a few dozen times, where I have only rolled on about 6 occasions. Her usual dose, as I&#039;ve seen before, is 600mg. 2 days ago my friend rolled on her half a gram. Shortly into her roll we found her on the bathroom floor, she was passed out running an insane temperature and had a racing pulse. We tried to wake her, and cool her down, but with little success.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It was eventually called that we needed to take her to the hospital, as this looked like a Meth overdose. So That&#039;s what we did. The remainder of the product was also taken to the hospital. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The product was tested, and did in fact contain methamphetamine as reported by the hospital lab. My good friend has been in the hospital, in a controlled coma for 2 days now.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;When I personally get my hands on the report, I&#039;ll take a photo and post it (of course blocking any identifying info), I know it&#039;s hard to believe a first time poster, I&#039;m not sure I would believe myself if I read this.<br /><br />I would like to post this in the seller&#039;s review thread, but I need 50 posts to do that, so I&#039;m here instead. <br /><br />The seller was Endemic. <br /><br />I honestly believe this was not personally Endemic&#039;s fault. Maybe his supplier sneaked some meth in because he was running low on molly, something. I don&#039;t want to bash Endemic too much, as the remainder of my experience with him has been wonderful, just got bad product this time around.<br /><br />I&#039;ve messaged Endemic with my concern, and also submitted a report to SR. If there&#039;s anything else I should do, I appreciate the input.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sincerely, and Much Love,<br />-b

				Wow! I am sorry to hear about your friend which landed her in the hospital due to the split meth/mdma overdose. One bad sale can ruin that dealers value. <br /><br />Were his reviews good at the moment of your purchase? Its sad to see some meth mixed with MDMA, it just makes other buyers be more cautious before buying something like MDMA. But then again this shows you that you cant ever be ready for something like this. <br /><br />Did you consume the other half and did it affect you? It seems that it didnt from what ive read but just curious to know what else happened.

				7Kz2: Not quite powder, but very highly crushed. Came to a mostly tan color, but also mostly too white and crushed to tell. <br /><br />And aussiepp: That&#039;s slightly less than her usual dose of 600mg. She&#039;s had a LOT more molly than I have and has rolled MANY more times than myself (I&#039;ve only rolled half a dozen times or so). I&#039;m also aware of the drug test showing a false positive. Though to the best of my knowledge, this is only for bodily fluid tests, and unlikely for testing the actual substance before it is ingested.<br /><br />pearlygates: No I didn&#039;t consume the other half. I had planned on doing so this weekend. Also, yes, his reviews were only outstanding. However, at the time, none had claimed to have actually tried the product yet. But that&#039;s also why I don&#039;t want to bash Endemic too much, It is a VERY strange reaction to JUST MDMA (and I very well believe that&#039;s all she had taken that night, I was there).<br /><br /><br />thank you so much everyone for the kind thoughts. The doctors are apparently going to try and wake her tomorrow morning. I&#039;ll update if I have anything noteworthy.

MDMA is usually not cut, because it is not.&nbsp; Different sellers have MDMA that is of slight different purity, but it it usually above 70% and a 500mg dosage from a usual dose of 600mg is insanely unlikely to be just a dosage mistake.

				Wow, .5g of molly, without checking purity, is just fucking stupid! <br /><br />Two good points were made that you completely overlooked.<br /><br />1. The A in MDMA is amphetamine sooooo, it&#039;s easy to understand why it came up positive.<br />2. The heroin analogy was spot on... Let me elaborate.. A .5g of 42% molly = .25 84%<br /><br />Sorry to hear bout your friend, but to take the whole half G was just fucking stupid, and you should feel like a world class d-bag for not giving her heads up.

Problems come in when someone finds something pure, like 84% MDMA. They might do what they think is a normal dose, but .5 of that would actually be 420mg MDMA. Make sense?

				One thing you have to think of aswell,is the lab.You can have pure MDMA from 2 diferent labs will affect you alil differently..5g is way to much especialy if youve never tried that specific batch.I&#039;ve been rolling since X pils were the size of rolaids Ive had the same pills from same dealer one night needing 2 for fun and one night floored by just one.Now i do Molly every now and again but no where nere that dose and I&#039;ve rolled hundreds of times.With that said I&#039;m very sorry for your friend.I wish you and her all the best.

				MDMA is most certainly often cut or just shit quality when it comes from street dealers, can easily be less than 50% purity, not so much on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;d call 600mg of pure MDMA an overdose regardless of how experienced you are. That said, I wouldn&#039;t expect to end up in a coma from an overdose of pure MDMA. It is possible that it contained something else, but also that she just had a bad reaction to an OD.<br /><br />An important point: Did the hospital say, it contains meth in addition to MDMA, or just it contains meth? And did they provide a hard copy of the test results or just tell you that? The hospital may or may not have the ability to distinguish between them depending on the type of test they&#039;re running. Considering the general stupidity of everyone who works in the healthcare industry regarding drugs I wouldn&#039;t put calling pure MDMA &quot;methamphetamine&quot; past them.&nbsp; Unless other buyers are saying that, you have a hard copy of test results from the hospital, or you send it into a lab yourself for testing there&#039;s no way to tell for sure, so I wouldn&#039;t take it out on the seller. I&#039;d give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe ask him if anyone else complained about the batch, and if anyone did and he&#039;s honest, he&#039;ll tell you. and most sellers i&#039;ve run into on SR are in fact honest because the dishonest ones don&#039;t stay in business long<br /><br />If you do have a copy of test results from the hospital I encourage you to post it on a secure tor image host because that will be a valuable insight on the whole matter

				500mg is a huge dose of MDMA, even if she is regular user. Lots of other things to factor in, was she taking any prescribed medicine / other recreational drugs a time? Combinations of drugs can sometimes have severe neurotoxic effects , all dependent on the individual persons metabolism / allergies / tolerance levels etc.<br />Regardless, hope she gets better soon.

That said, I wouldn&#039;t expect to end up in a coma from an overdose of pure MDMA. It is possible that it contained something else, but also that she just had a bad reaction to an OD.<br /><br />An important point: Did the hospital say, it contains meth in addition to MDMA, or just it contains meth? And did they provide a hard copy of the test results or just tell you that? The hospital may or may not have the ability to distinguish between them depending on the type of test they&#039;re running. Considering the general stupidity of everyone who works in the healthcare industry regarding drugs I wouldn&#039;t put calling pure MDMA &quot;methamphetamine&quot; past them.&nbsp; Unless other buyers are saying that, you have a hard copy of test results from the hospital, or you send it into a lab yourself for testing there&#039;s no way to tell for sure, so I wouldn&#039;t take it out on the seller. I&#039;d give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe ask him if anyone else complained about the batch, and if anyone did and he&#039;s honest, he&#039;ll tell you. and most sellers i&#039;ve run into on SR are in fact honest because the dishonest ones don&#039;t stay in business long<br /><br />If you do have a copy of test results from the hospital I encourage you to post it on a secure tor image host because that will be a valuable insight on the whole matter<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />agreed couldnt have said it any better myself....but starting out taking a dose of 600mg its stupid why not start at 190-200mg and gauge the reaction i mean even the most experienced molly users i know start out small to gauge the product first, and i hope it all comes out for the best but like this guy said check around with other people on the forums and what not and see if reactions are similar or not with the vendor and def. read that TOX. report to try to find any clues! keep us up to date on your friend!

				Sorry to hear about what happened to your friend. I certainly hope she comes out of it okay.<br /><br />As most everyone else has stated in this thread, that is an insanely high dose of MDMA regardless of purity. With that said, I believe that everyone should make the small investment to get a good test kit and always test any new product you get. I purchased one for $60 around two years ago and I still have plenty of reagent left. And the $60 one is actually one of the more expensive kits that tests for virtually any kind of adulterant that could be present. There are cheaper ones available for like $20. But just think about it this way -- for a very small investment, you know exactly what you are ingesting. Not only is it great for safety, but I also find that it puts me at ease mentally going into the experience, because I know the substance I just ingested is pure and free of nasty stuff that could harm my body.<br /><br />A good milligram scale and a test kit are well worth the investment for anyone who consumes MDMA or other such things on a regular basis.<br /><br />I got mine from here: (warning - clearnet link) http://dancesafe.org/products/complete-screening-kit<br /><br />Best of luck and be safe.<br /><br />Peace.

				OP, I hope your friend makes a quick and complete recovery.<br /><br />It shows there is decision making to do even when taking a journey to anahata. I remember my first mdma trip in 1972, in my college dorm. When I started coming down nice and easy, for some reason I picked up a bible in the drawer and started reading it. Then something happened, I got this sense of peace and comfort out of nowhere, all blissed out for a few hours. Back then the stuff was very pure. Nowadays things are much different.<br /><br />Everyone makes mistakes. She made the ultimate decision to take the stuff. It is not your fault, OP. You have done the right thing by her, and by sharing this here, it helps us all to be more aware of our decisions.<br /><br />Lesson learned. We play,we be safe, we watch out for each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Wikipedia</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Purity and dosage of &quot;ecstasy&quot;<br />MDMA powder<br /><br />Another concern associated with MDMA use is toxicity from chemicals other than MDMA in ecstasy tablets. Due to its near-universal illegality, the purity of a substance sold as ecstasy is unknown to the typical user. The MDMA content of tablets varies widely between regions and different brands of pills and fluctuates somewhat each year. Pills may contain other active substances meant to stimulate in a way similar to MDMA, such as amphetamine, mephedrone, methamphetamine, ephedrine, caffeine, all of which may be comparatively cheap to produce and can help to boost overall profits. In some cases, tablets sold as ecstasy do not even contain any MDMA. Instead they may contain an assortment of undesirable drugs and substances, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, talcum powder, etc.[85]<br /><br />A number of deaths have been attributed to para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), a hallucinogenic amphetamine, being sold as ecstasy.[86][87] PMA is unique in its ability to quickly elevate body temperature and heart rate at relatively low doses, especially in comparison to MDMA. Hence, users believing they are consuming two 120-mg pills of MDMA could actually be consuming a dose of PMA that is potentially lethal, depending on the purity of the pill. Not only does PMA cause the release of serotonin, but it also acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. When combined with an MDMA or an MDMA-like substance, serotonin syndrome can result.[88] Combining MAO inhibitors with certain legal prescription and over-the-counter medications can also lead to (potentially fatal) serotonin syndrome.<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA#Purity_and_dosage_of_&quot;ecstasy&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				If she was used to doing .6 of molly she probably wasn&#039;t doing pure molly or has developed some serious holes in her brain from doing so.<br /><br />SR molly is all pretty potent and should be treated as such - you should have tested it BEFORE ingesting as well as starting small. Even experienced users should only dose 150-200mg for pure molly. Hope your friend is okay and hope you learned a lesson.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read a few reviews about Endemic&#039;s mdma and people said it was good stuff - granted they only took 100-200 mg.

				Don&#039;t think it was an OD from the product being cut with meth btw as I&#039;m sure pure mdma will test positive for meth as well. Sounded like she got serotonin syndrome -<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome<br /><br />5 points at once sounds like an easy way to get serotonin syndrome dude.

				I&#039;m sorry that it&#039;s taken so long to make an appearance in this thread. I&#039;d been searching the rumor mill and hadn&#039;t found anything.<br /><br />First, let me offer my sincerest sympathies and concern for this poor girl. It certainly sounds like serotonin syndrome to me. This situation has my stomach in absolute knots. More than LE, I worry about things like this.<br /><br />I won&#039;t beat a dead horse here, but 500-600mg is overdose territory, plain and simple. Big or small, male or female. Experience counts for naught at these levels. Someone who has always done pressed pills may not understand that a 600mg pill is 500mg filler and binder, with only 100mg active MDMA.<br /><br />Also, this MDMA was not cut with meth. Anyone wishing to know the (extremely reputable) source, feel free to PM as I don&#039;t have explicit permission to reference their name with regard to my resale. Once you know where this last batch came from, you&#039;ll understand that we&#039;re dealing with MDMA of very high purity.<br /><br />I never, ever trust reputation alone, however. I always reagent test every new batch, and this one was no different. The Marquis test went straight to purple/black with no other colors or strange reactions. I&#039;ve also roll tested it and it was very clean MDMA. If cut with meth, I&#039;d have been up for 8-10hrs, which was not the case. Effects start to tail off at 3-4hrs, and past 6hrs or so, it&#039;s getting to be bedtime. <br /><br />In the USA, at least, meth is at least 2x more $/g than MDMA, which makes it a pretty unlikely cut for the same reason that opium isn&#039;t usually cut with heroin. It&#039;s even spendier I believe in the countries that I source from. I don&#039;t know what else I can say on this point, except that (which others have pointed out) MDMA is a member of the amphetamine drug class and will test positive as such in many analysis results.<br /><br />Again, I&#039;m very sorry to hear about this girl and her trouble. I hope she will make a full recovery.<br /><br />I&#039;m disappointed, however, to see my name dragged out here in addition to an amended 1/5 feedback rating because of the misuse of my product. Any harm reduction thread or website out there will advise against going too far beyond 150-200mg. I realize that street X can be of such a terrible purity that 600mg might be necessary to get off, but I&#039;m not so sure that my reputation should take a hit when I supply the real deal and someone goes overboard with it. I&#039;m just being straight here, but my primary concern is the safety of my customers, not my feedback score. I do understand that this thread was started with the best intentions and out of concern for a friend and for others, and I completely respect and commend that attitude.<br /><br />FWIW, I&#039;ve been getting very good roll reports from some of the other buyers of the last batch.<br /><br />To the OP: I&#039;ve responded to your message and will continue to be here for your support. All the best.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Endemic

				sounds fair enough to me endemic. if somebody cut their wrists with a knife they wouldn&#039;t go after the hardware store that sold it to them. so why the fuck should they make a big deal when someone fucks themselves up with drugs. even if somebody od&#039;d on paracetamol(tylenol) they wouldn&#039;t go after the pharmacist that supplied it. because it would be the persons own stupid fault for being so reckless with it in the first place, nothing else.
