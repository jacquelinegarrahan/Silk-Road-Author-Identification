				I started a thread the other day here, everyone and his dog had put their 2 cents in. Then the above mentioned comes in and states that, quote&quot; And this community is looked up to by people&quot; or some bullshit along them lines. Listen wake up you are on a drug forum with smackheads, meth heads, crack heads, and you&#039;re worried about what outsiders think of a comical thread.<br />Newsflash not everyone thinks debating the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of partial physics and whatever boring shit your going on about today, is going to bring the road into disrepute, Do you actually think people respect that your buying drugs and god knows what. some one needs to give their head a long wobble.

				Yeah, I actually think the Road deserves a lot of respect. Honestly I think the potential for harm from drugs purchased off of SR is so much lower than those purchased from the street.<br /><br />That guy you barely know that sells &#039;meth&#039;. Yeah, you probably enjoy it and who knows what it&#039;s cut with. Here though you can be reasonably certain you&#039;re getting what you pay for (if you do your research, which all the information is here to find, unlike on the street). <br /><br />To me that&#039;s a very respectable thing to be doing.

The atmosphere is one of a revolutionary anonymous open market for almost anything. Hell, the lack of firearms is the only complaint I have about SR. It&#039;s simply the &quot;black market&quot;, and to be a part of that is something more than using, buying, or selling drugs. It&#039;s saying &quot;No.&quot; to economic standards. It&#039;s saying &quot;No.&quot; to regulations, laws, and bans.<br /><br />IMO, the SR community promotes a spirit of partying, professionalism (for it&#039;s products, that is), and none of the macho-gangster-bullshit that comes with the territory on the streets. With the chill, anonymous, and infinitely spaced realm of SR, a vendor (or customer) can use the Road without the worries of the Game. <br /><br />Just my two cents.
