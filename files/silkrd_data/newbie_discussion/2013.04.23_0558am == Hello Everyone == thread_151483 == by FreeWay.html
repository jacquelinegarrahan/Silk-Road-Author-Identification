				thanks for the welcome. it definitely grabs u by the balls but i balance it out by using other drugs as well lol so it gets a smaller grasp on my balls. ima be offering oxys in bulk and small orders as well as coke and crack in bulk in small orders. i got a shitload of really great H so after i get a good amount off ima purchase the other items. im extremely generous also i know the good feeling u get when u get more then what you paid for. im just happy i can give that feeling to others now.

				I don&#039;t use &quot;H&quot; as you call it because of all the horrible things I&#039;ve heard about it.<br /><br />Do you feel like the dangers of heroin are overplayed by the media and it can be taken safely?<br /><br />I just hope all the Silk Road users are keepin it real with this stuff.

				no the dangers are real i would never recomend anyone to try it that hasnt. its a dangerous drug if not used properly. i use myself so i definitely dont judge but if youve been avoiding it for this long you shouldnt try it. its a hard drug to control it takes alot of will power and strenth and once it gets a hold of you its hard to release its grip. it provides a good feeling tho i must say but it comes at a cost.

				+1 FreeWay. I like the way you operate. <br /><br />Ive been teetering on getting a stamp or two, just havnt made the dive yet. <br /><br />I snorted a few mgs years ago, and it made me sick. That was long before i began to love opiates. I love my roxis, and any other pain killer i get my mitts on, Im just afraid that i will like it way too much lol. <br /><br />&nbsp;Though i have never been an addict, of any sort, other than just drugs in general, hehe. I have enough will power to kick anything at any given time, just more times that not, i find myself, not actually wanting to kick anything. Lots of times, id rather suffer and regret it later, for the goodness in the moment ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;Chances are, ill be getting a stamp or three some time or another.. LOL i just lOve too feeel goood hehehe

				thanks for the karma. and yah i have the same issue. u want to stop but then you think about how good you feel and all that goes out the window. remember my first 100 are getting hooked up no matter which listing you chose. i sent out alot of stuff im just waiting for the feedback to come in. i know u cant trust every vendor so i cant wait until everyone reports on how good and how well ive been hooking them up. my first 100 im not worried about profit so im trying to make everyone more then happy.

				After some 5 or 6 years of use I havent used it for more than 10 years now... and just seeing the listings still gives me a bit of that old chilling-nausea feeling...<br /><br />But I know some day, no hurry, when I can get away from the family for a weekend, I&#039;ll order a bit of it, and some good white flakes, to enjoy a speedball weekend, just for the old times!!! I still havent tried anything barely like that, when it&#039;s good. And I&#039;ve tried lots of things!<br /><br />But I have to agree with the opinions told here, its not something to take lightly. <br /><br />(Sorry, just couldnt hold myself from posting. All the best to the new seller!)

				hey freeway! As I said in a private SR messege, I am usually a customer of Marlo but he didn&#039;t have a listing up so I figured I&#039;d give you a shot. <br /><br />On SUNDAY 4-28-13 I placed an order for the Gram of H DPR Respect Special, I managed to get on that night and the order still said processing. I am wondering if you managed to get my address and happen to ship my order even with all this going on?<br /><br />Ill PM you as well, but I will be on here all night!<br /><br />Thanks Bud

				I&#039;ve seen lives ruined by H so I&#039;ll never touch it myself but I cant knock the hustle because when theres a demand there needs to be a supplier to meet that demand. Enter in you lol. So i wish you the best here on SR and if I could +1 I would.

				Good luck FreeWay always need another H vendor on here with decent prices to lower the competitors prices most vendors prices are fairly steep i guess that&#039;s the cost of convenience.not complaining. Also to anyone wanting to try H If you haven&#039;t already don&#039;t. It is a HELL of a drug its took me to hell and back quite a few times not to mention burnt bridges,jail etc.Thankfully ive been clean since i was released from my last incarceration although i have been clean for 4 months the addiction will always stay with you.&nbsp; Ive lost quite a few friends/family to it whether they died are they are incarcerated.The feelings great if you have strong will power to know when to quit.If you have an addictive personality an you try it i promise nothing good will come from it so be smart and be safe.
