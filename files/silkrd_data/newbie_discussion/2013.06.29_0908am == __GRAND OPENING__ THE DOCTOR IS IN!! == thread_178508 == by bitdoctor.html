				Ordered some of bitdoctor&#039;s MDMA and cocaine.&nbsp; It arrived to my part in the US in four days, in a discretely wrapped parcel.&nbsp; Reagent tests on the MDMA were all straight to black with a quick response to the testing agents.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a test kit for the cocaine, but my test subjects all exclaimed that it was the best coke that they had enjoyed in a very long time.&nbsp; Bitdoctor was quick to respond to all of my messages with all replies happening within 4 hours.&nbsp; Bit doctor will be added to my list of trusted vendors.

Thats what we always called the top o the line pure shit back in the day. Now everything is fishscale this and fishscale that. That word is used so much that it&#039;s lost it;s meaning . I think I&#039;m gonna havta sample your SHALE...,.. :)

				Sorry if this comes as bad news...Bitdoctor is getting OUT of the coke game. My product was excellant quality, I just cant find it cheap enough to be competitive. Its a very expensive product here and I am not comfortable putting something in the mail for only a few dollars in my pocket.
