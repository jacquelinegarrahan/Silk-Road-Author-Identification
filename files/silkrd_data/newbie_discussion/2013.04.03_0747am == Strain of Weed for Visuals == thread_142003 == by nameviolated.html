				I had a different strain of weed last year and after smoking it I had visuals for at least a couple of hours.&nbsp; Would this have been a strain (If so what was it?), or was it mixed with something?

				I can remember a time I was given weed that had been cut with bleach. I had low grade hallucinations (I can&#039;t remember most of it but I do remember seeing a white elephant!) for around half an hour I&#039;d say.&nbsp; It probably doesn&#039;t help you but since the memory of it popped into my mind, I just thought I&#039;d share

				You were probably just really, really high. I&#039;ve gotten some visuals when I&#039;ve taken epic hits after not smoking weed for a while. Take a gravity bong hit to the face of some nice bud after a tolerance break, and report back sir!

				Sounds like it was laced.<br /><br />Some weed is more psychedelic than others though..&nbsp; NCK&#039;s THC Snow for example had me feeling like I was tripping first time I smoked it.<br /><br />edit: just remembered, also got visuals on hash from NorCal40Hookup (first time I had smoked hash in years)
