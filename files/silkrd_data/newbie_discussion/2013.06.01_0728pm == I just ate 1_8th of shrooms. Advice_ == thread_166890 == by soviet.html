				This will be my first time tripping. I took about a whole 1/8th of cubes to myself, so in about an hour ill be trippin&#039; pretty hard...wish me luck!&nbsp; ;D<br />They fucking tasted like dried cat food.&nbsp; I&#039;m by myself in my house. I know a trip sitter is recommended for first timers but I strongly felt that I should do this by myself, and if anything I can call my friends over.<br />I have good music on, trippy Youtube videos ready, and even Adventure Time open in one tab lol. <br />Anybody have any recommended activities for me? Or any other advice? Remember, keep the vibes positive!

				Best advise is like you said, stay positive.&nbsp; Keep doing fun shit, whatever u enjoy doing!&nbsp; If things start to get scary just remind yourself that its all in your mind.&nbsp; Being indoors sometimes causes bad trips, if you feel crammed up, just go outside, take a walk to straighten yourself out.&nbsp; Have fun man, enjoy the trip!

				Stay positive, don&#039;t fight whatever comes your way and make sure you are in an adequate set and setting. Depending on the potency of the shrooms, it can get VERY intense. I recall ordering an 1/8th of shrooms from a past vendor named Rocker. She was kind enough to hook it up with an extra gram so I dosed 4.5g of her potent texan strain solo. It easily changed my life and perspective on the divine having had an ego death experience and found myself in union with the godhead. Very powerful stuff.

				What most people fail to mention is the come-up. You may feel sick and like you want to puke for an hour or so. During this stage, relax, lie down, close your eyes, and stay perfectly still. Putting any stress on your body (even just walking around) may cause you to puke, which you don&#039;t want. The come-up sucks, but it WILL pass, completely.<br /><br />Once the come-up is over, you will start to get high on shrooms :) and the nausea will lift.<br /><br />At this point, if possible, smoke a bunch of weed. Weed activates and enhances shrooms IME.<br /><br />Keep the beats going !!!! Music is your friend on shrooms, but stay away from TV and video games. You want to go into your mind, and the latter are distractions.<br /><br />And the most important advice of all ... ENJOY :D<br /><br />Your mind is a very interesting place, as you will find.<br />

Basically stating that they are allowed to profile any one, and if they deem it fit, they have the authority to basically harass any one they think looks suspect.. for anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;They will pull up, jump out on you, and just begin to run your pockets and shit. Shit once, many moons ago, i was walking over to a friends house, tripping balls on pcp and k (thank the lord it was mushys or L, i would have bugged out and jammed my self up good), it was about 1am, so not too late, still plenty of people walking around, I hit a corner, unmarked car jumps the curb in front of me hits me with the spot lights, and over the PA speaker &quot;stop!, lift up your sweater! Hold it up! Spin around!&quot;...<br /><br />&nbsp;After i complied with out question, as they backed off the side walk, i asked what the fuck the problem was, they replied &quot; you looked like you where packing heat&quot;. LMAO, My goodness, talk about shit a brick..not just cause i was all shitty on a smorgasboard of drugs, but mainly because at that time i wad dealing blow, and had like $700 in $50 bags in my balls, lol. <br /><br />&nbsp;Moral is, do what you think is best. Maybe just chill in your yard, on the porch or on your roof. In or on YOUR property.. This of coarse does not apply if you live in a suburban/quiet/nice good neighborhood.

				lots of times when coming up on shrooms, you feel like you&#039;re going to be way higher than you feel comfortable being.&nbsp; this feeling will probably pass, don&#039;t worry.&nbsp; if it doesn&#039;t, you won&#039;t die, don&#039;t worry.

				The visuals on mushrooms are excellent... better than acid.<br />close your eyes.. and watch the Kaleidoscope on the back of your eye-lids.<br />It&#039;s a special experience, don&#039;t miss it.<br /><br />You might find yourself having really deep, or really special, imaginative ideas.<br />My recommendation is that you write these down... why ?<br />Because tomorrow, or next week, or next month, you can read these ideas <br />and realise, ... they&#039;re all complete bollocks. :-)<br /><br />

				As I type this it&#039;s been about 8 hours after I came down. I&#039;ll write a full trip report sooner or later but here&#039;s most of it:<br /><br />I came up with minimal nausea, which was pleasant. I sat back down at the computer to check your suggestions and then I looked down at the computer desk and i&#039;m all like &quot;holy shit when did this table become so cool?&quot;. The lines and growth rings on the desk became rivers of flowing, pulsating, breathing brownness. I began smiling because I knew the trip had started, and then I started laughing because I pictured how funny I must have looked sitting there fuckin&#039; smiling at a wooden table. This went on for a little while. As a matter of fact I&#039;m sitting at the same table right now, looking at the magical lines trying to get them to flow again but it won&#039;t work :(<br /><br />I saw breathtaking patterns and impossible colors in many things, but there were two noteworthy ones. The first of these was my own face. Shortly after the table became magical I went over to my mirror. I noticed that my pupils were dilated as fuck and started cracking up again. Then I focused more on my face and began seeing scaly-like reptilian patterns there. This got me laughing more. The other noteworthy visuals I got were on my cat. I just laid down next to him on the carpet and pet him for like an hour or two. His fur was so mind-bogglingly soft that it was like running my hands through a fluffy fog. The fur also produced ice-crystal like patterns that pulsated beautifully along with the cat&#039;s breathing, and turned to a light hue of purple occasionally. <br /><br />After laughing and happily tripping for I don&#039;t know how long things got weird. The laughing went away. I sort of went from actively enjoying the experience to just riding the high as the trip became more intense on my mind. After a little bit of this I really wanted to go back to the euphoria and the laughter, but changing the music or setting didn&#039;t work. As I realized that nothing was working I asked myself whether I was starting to have a bad trip, but all sense of pleasant and unpleasant escaped my perceptive ability, if that makes sense. The only &quot;unpleasant&quot; thing I felt were a kind of urge to go back to the laughing stage and some confusion, but these were pretty minor. I remember going back to this post and reading a few replies and the post of &quot;dirtybiscuitzz718&quot; probably ended up saving me from some really scary shit. <br /><br />I rode the laughless trip for who knows how long, and then BAM my fucking my mom comes home early. I begin panicking a little and hastily turn off the music, shut down tor and go to my room. I laid there pretending to sleep, all the while worrying that I had left something awry in the house and that it would give away that I was tripping. Luckily nothing was wrong and nobody came in my room, but I was still buggin&#039; the fuck out. When I closed my eyes to pretend to sleep I got a brand-new set of visuals. These weren&#039;t open-eyed visuals or closed-eye visuals, but rather they felt like I was seeing them from my frontal lobe or the inside of my forehead. These were very intense. They were pretty much fractals, but fractals of really weird shit (i.e. hands). So imagine a spiraling column of hands and/or equally strange and random things that would twist and turn and dive and turn inside out and REPLICATE in impossible directions. This is where I began telling myself repeatedly to &quot;embrace the madness&quot; as biscuitzz said. Coincidentally, I had my &quot;revelation&quot;, if you will, in this panic maddened state. When I was watching the fractals I noticed that they lived, they reproduced, and they evolved. I saw them as a representation of the nature of life. Live. Reproduce. Evolve. I concluded that humans were no different than things like DNA or cells, in that we&#039;re just extremely complex chemical systems that are meant to replicate and survive. Being a very rational person I was pretty aware of this before the trip, but this really drove it in. The moment of clarity only lasted a moment though. The rest of the time I was buggin out in my bed.<br /><br />After about an hour and a half of silently freaking out I began coming down. My friend called me to check on me, and I had a pretty solid grasp on reality but was still high (pupils still very dilated), so I asked him to give me a ride to my other friend&#039;s house. I was completely down about an hour later. The whole thing lasted about 6.5 hours. <br /><br />Notes: Music/sound contributed greatly to the visuals and to my state of mind. Shortly after my laughing stage stopped I accidentally changed the music to something heavier and that added a bit of harshness to the trip. During some point when I was pretending to sleep I opened my eyes and, seeing as to how there was no music anymore, absorbed all of the other sounds. For about 10 minutes all of the sounds combined and formed a kaleidoscope of interesting nonsensical noise that actually sounded pretty cool. I was pretty surprised to find that trippy videos/pictures/lava lamps were really uninteresting. They seemed to cheapen the experience. I&#039;m pretty sure I dosed about 1 gram too much, but I don&#039;t regret it. Next time i&#039;ll take a little bit less and go watch stars and hug trees and shit =D<br /><br />Thanks to everybody who offered suggestions, and thanks especially to dirtybiscuit for probably saving my mind from a thrashing. If my ventures on the road go well i&#039;ll post a few more psychedelic first-times in the future. Thanks for reading comrades, and remember to embrace the madness!<br />

Sucks your mom got home early I could definitely see that freaking me out my first few times tripping. <br /><br />One thing that is also good to keep in mind is that, I believe, all bad trips are trying to teach you something. It might be extremely scary at the time, but you need to really think about it and figure out what it&#039;s trying to tell you and take the good out of it. I had an extremely bad trip one time and it ended up helping me cope with the death of a family member. <br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to ask!<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Every time I trip on shrooms all I can think about is how shitty my life has been going and how big of an ass I have been. I feel really helpless and drained I can&#039;t get comfortable and I feel like I&#039;m being tormented.

				I had a 3.5g trip on mushies locally picked by myself and went on a lone nature trek. No music, no friends, completely out in the wilderness and I freaked the fuck out. It was just too intense and I had completely landed on an alien planet and nothing was familiar or real. Id taken psychedelics many times before this but 3.5g of our local strain growing here, Psilocybe subaeruginosa, which from what Ive read are reasonably high potency mushroom, was too much at that time and setting. It wasnt till I got back to my car and put some music on that I started to enjoy it and relax a little. <br />Im not really one for psychedelics. I have too much stress and anxiety when Im sober without and mushie madness to it all. I cant really embrace the madness either. I just like to feel like I must have control of my sanity or I freak out thinking Ive lost my mind for eternity. Comes down to personality and mind set. That adventure was not the last time Ive done shrooms but it is by far the most memorable and intense. Ill probably do it again some day but not again in time soon. Mushie season where I am has just finished for the year. I prefer to find my own than rely on others judgement. We have a look a like that can grow side by side with the real ones called a death cap. You eat one of them accidently its game over. You can tell them apart but if you know how but fuck trusting anyone else to. <br />There is a great book called &quot;Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World&quot; by Paul Stamets. Its got some great information and identification and background on Magic Mushrooms from all over the world. You may not even know you have them growing in your front garden. If any are interested I recommend this book and it should be easy to find online.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				For those of you that have had at least moderate experience with psychedelics, which drug should I try next: LSD or DMT? Would it be unwise of me to jump straight into DMT given my inexperience? Also, what are the similarities and differences between an LSD vs Shroom trip? I&#039;ve read that on LSD the trip is less mental and you have more control over yourself. Thoughts?

				LSD is more euphoric and last much longer. The dangers are about the same (mentally) and neither will be toxic if you source clean product. LSD just seems to go on forever when you dont enjoy it. A 12 hour experience can feel like days if you want to snap out of it and come back to earth. But then LSD seems to be more clear and less groggy than shrooms. Take LSD somewhere where there are positive vibes, good music and nice people and you should find its better than mushrooms which dont really give you energy or the same euphoric high as LSD. <br />DMT Ive never tried but Ive read alot about it. It would be a very overwhelming experience if you take a &quot;break through&quot; dose to experience an out of world/body experience. I dont really know what to recommend but maybe buy an acid tab and take half wait till it kicks in then dump the next half. DMT is a fairly large leap in the realm of psychedelics for inexperienced users. But then everyone is different and sees everything in their own perspective. Id do some reading on others experiences on erowid or elsewhere on the web to find out what you are in for. Like I said in the last post Im not big on psychedelics myself but Im in no way against anyone else trying them. You just got to know yourself and what you can handle. Im not keen on trying DMT myself but Im still curious how it would go. Tried Salvia a few times and that shit is not fun. Completely different drug and works in a completely different way. <br />Id go the LSD route first if I were you. If the Mushie experience experience was good I cant see why you would not enjoy LSD. Probably even better if anything.&nbsp;
