				as another user pointed out in one of the other threads, might as well have a bit of conversation to get to 50.<br /><br />have any of you played any of the lottos on here?&nbsp; just curious.&nbsp; i was flipping through the reviews for some of them and thought it was funny &quot;1 in 8 wins&quot; and then there&#039;s 30 reviews in a row &quot;damn, i lost&quot;&nbsp; i never did find one that claimed to win, but i quickly got bored and stopped reading.&nbsp; any of you ever play?&nbsp; are there any legitimate ones?&nbsp; not planning on playing, just curious.

				I know for a fact the 50/50 pays out. Ive won up to 10$ a chance. I don&#039;t bet much either. &amp; You actually double your money. The 1 in 8 is real as well as the 1 in16

				Any newbie volunteers want to step up and see if this lotto stuff is legit? Im too much of a puss to waste my seldom bitcoins.... If someone tried and reported their experience back here that would be pretty rad

				I think I&#039;ll avoid them, seems to be no way of verifying the integrity should someone indulge in a little selective scamming.

				This is a great question. I have come very close a couple of times to giving up some coin for a chance to win some product. I have yet to see a post from a trusted member that has won or talks about the lotteries be legit. I plan to stay away, besides having rotten luck..lol

				I have played multiple times and have pretty much just broken even here on sr. The only one I use and like is http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/349d01f73c I have played and won enough to buy PLs coupons and other digital things oh and shrooms. :) I still play every now and then I have tried their other ones also but have yet to win on those. They reply pretty fast also pay real quick without having to send them any messages like the others require. Its like the old saying you cant win if you dont play.
