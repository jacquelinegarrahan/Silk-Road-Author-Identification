				That is easy.&nbsp; Use a pyrex beaker.&nbsp; Heat the cocaine in some water until it turns into oil and add about 25% baking soda slowly while whipping it and stretching it across the bottom.&nbsp; I always used a metal pot with water and a cloth in the bottom and put the beaker inside the pot of water.&nbsp; When it combines on the bottom and is spread nicely then put it on a flat surface in the freezer.&nbsp; After it hardens in the bottom you can dump it out on a coffee filter.<br /><br />If it is for personals then you can just put some ammonia in a shot glass and add a gram of cocaine.&nbsp; Filter with a coffee filter.

				I used to use a large test tube and add C and soda into the tube and add water. Heat it and slowly swirl until it rocks up. but I keep hearing about whipping it and have no idea what that is? It that like stiring it? forgive my ignorance. So ammonia acts as a solvent and removes the impurities and leaves the coke as a freebase? i could Google all this but I&#039;m trying to get my 50 without spamming too much.

				The most simple way I ever cooked it up for personal use:<br /><br /><br />Get a small pyrex glass bowl.&nbsp; Put in about a cup of ammonia (about 1/4 bowl full) in the bottom.&nbsp; Throw a couple grams - a 8ball in the ammonia.&nbsp; Stir it up in the ammonia for 10-15 seconds..&nbsp; Stick it in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds (DO NOT LET IT BOIL - This will make it splatter all over your microwave!).&nbsp; You just need the ammonia hot enough to melt the coke.&nbsp; Check it.&nbsp; Keep zapping it for another 10-15 seconds till all the coke turns into OIL on the surface of the ammonia. <br /><br />THEN - Take out the bowl and slowly swish it around for several minutes.&nbsp; As it cools you will slowly start to see those oil slicks start to turn into white rocks.&nbsp; JUST KEEP SWISHING!&nbsp; The oil will start attaching to the stones that are starting to form.&nbsp; Swish til there is NO OIL left.&nbsp; Stick the bowl into the freezer for about 5-10 minutes and make sure the ammonia has completely cooled.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then take a coffee filter and filter out all the rocks!<br /><br />You are going to want to rinse the shit out of these rocks to get all the ammonia off.&nbsp; That stuff is nasty.<br /><br />Ammonia crack doesn&#039;t taste as good as baking soda crack, but it&#039;s so easy and fool proof.&nbsp; SUPER EASY for anyone to do.&nbsp; Good luck and be careful.&nbsp; I ended up addicted to crack for 3 years because someone taught me how to do this with my coke one day.&nbsp; It ruined my life.<br /><br />You&#039;ve been warned about this stone so sweet.

				Stick to soda.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to smoke that ammonia.&nbsp; It tastes nasty and it CANT be good for you.<br /><br />But on the bright side, you only need like 4 more posts to 50.&nbsp; What happens when you get 50 posts?

				This is for personal use. I might just try both methods to give them a try. I saw a post in a different forum about shroom vendor and wanted to post because i am one, but had to get my 50 posts first. I think this is my 50th post yay!!
