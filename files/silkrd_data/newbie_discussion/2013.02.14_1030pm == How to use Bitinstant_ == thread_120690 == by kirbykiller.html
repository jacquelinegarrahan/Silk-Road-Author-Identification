				How do I use bit instant? <br /><br />I am using the guide here: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2012/04/how-to-buy-bitcoins-anonymously-in-the-us-instantly/<br /><br />and once I get to Step 5. Follow the instructions on Bitinstant to make your cash deposit, and have your Bitcoins sent to your new Tormail account.<br />No ID is needed.<br /><br />It takes me to zip zap. What do I do with zip zap?

				You&#039;re fucked. ONLY USE CASH. <br />Im sure you will be fine but if someone wanted to trace the transaction they could easily trace it back to you because you used your credit card. get off the road if you dont understand anonymity

				You do not need a Tormail account or TOR to buy BTC. Purchasing BTC is legal. At some point, if the US does decide to go for internet control legislation again and somehow succeeds, then you may want to consider using TOR to access bitinstant, but you still would not need a Tormail address. <br /><br />I use bitinstant&#039;s direct to BTC address, via Moneygram. <br /><br />Once you fill out all of your information, you should be taken to a page where you can select your payment location and receive a zipzap payment slip. Zipzap is the company that processes the actual USD transaction for bitinstant. <br /><br />You can choose whichever payment method you want, but I use the cash deposit as I find it easiest. From there, I head to the nearest Moneygram location and make the deposit. The coins usually show up within an hour or so. I get it sent to a personal address, then move it on to SR, and just change my SR address every few deposits. <br /><br />If you need additional clarification on any of that, feel free to ask!

				My advice is just do Cash Deposit (Walmart/CVS) to your SR BTC Wallet address - it&#039;ll save you a lot of time. <br /><br />My other advice would be to QUIT WASTING TIME, BTC is going up by the minute, so hopefully your purchase you&#039;re looking to make is tied to dollars, not BTC, cuz you&#039;re screwing yourself.&nbsp; Remember, like has been said several times, buying BTC is LEGAL 100%, so there&#039;s nothing wrong with what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; It&#039;s only if you decide to make a transaction that may be illegal - but even then - whatever transaction you&#039;re doing, SR&#039;s tumbler is going to help mask the origin of the BTC - so not much risk (especially if you&#039;re buying a personal amount - not many LE agencies are truly interested in busting addicts for use (maybe other crimes, etc..).<br /><br />Your real risk is the shipping/receiving of said product - but even then, there is minimal risk - that&#039;s why SR works.&nbsp; Unless you&#039;re Tony Montana and getting some weight shipped to you, it isn&#039;t a big worry.<br /><br />Best of luck!

				One other thing about using the &#039;red phone&#039; at CVS/Wal-Mart - they ask you for a moneygram rewards number or phone # -- use one you can remember, because when you go back to get more, it can save you a lot of time because it &#039;remembers&#039; the merchant you want to pay (Z-I-P-Z-A-P) lol...&nbsp; Also, remember the charge for zipzap to process is $3.95, so I usually deposit $X96.05 so that way I can give them an even amount at the register.&nbsp; It just shuts down the opportunity for fail at the register.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I know all of the prompts by heart so I can do the transaction in about 3 minutes.<br /><br />Let me know if you have any other questions!!

				Thanks guys. I made one transaction through BitMe (Chase) so far, and it went smoothly. I saved more than I would&#039;ve paid elsewhere, but had to wait a few hours for that seller to come along and give me a deal. I&#039;m going to look into Blue Sky Traders (.onion site), but don&#039;t have any more worries about going through BitInstant, either.
