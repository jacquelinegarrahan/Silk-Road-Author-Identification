				So I&#039;m at the &#039;complete newbie&#039; stage right now, got the PGP sussed and now on to the bitcoins. So, do I need to get my own wallet from somewhere like blockchain or easywallet, if I&#039;m going to buy BTC from Mt Gox for example? <br />Is a wallet something I need or do my BTC just hang around my Mt Gox account until I send them on their way to SR?<br />Am I obsessed with Mt Gox, and might there be a better way for a UK dweller who is able to do bank transfers, etc?<br />This is really a question for the security forum I suppose but I&#039;m stuck in newbie-limbo-probation for now - besides, this is a VERY newbish question so it kinda belongs here&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\

				I know nothing of getting coin in the UK, but I do advise you open a couple ewallets..and probably a desktop wallet as well.

				Cool, will look into the ewallets. <br /><br />Right now the process is looking like; <br />1)Fund my Mt Gox account with money from bank transfer, <br />2)Buy some BTC on MtGox marketplace,<br />(I&#039;m a bit confused as to where the BTC will be sitting between steps 2 and 3...I think it may be possible, if inadvisable, to skip step 3 - I will not skip it!)<br />3)Remove the BTC to my ewallet or desktop wallet,<br />4)Do stuff with my BTC.

				As of today though, Mt. Gox requires ID verification for anyone transferring paper currency to/from them. You may want to buy your BTC another way.

				Don&#039;t use MtGox - it&#039;s already too big. You should use (if you&#039;re in the UK) a SEPA transfer to your IBAN / SWIFT code. It&#039;s a pan-European no-fees fast transfer method. Oh and I suggest Bitstamp or Intersango.<br /><br />My account was verified within one day, I cashed out bitcoins at $130 each and then did a SEPA transfer to my own bank.<br /><br />Perfect, no fees, goes in as GBP into my account.<br /><br />There&#039;s also Intersango (I think used to be Britcoin?) but they kinda suck. They have little activity so it&#039;s really hard to buy/sell at anything near the current rates and it takes way longer for them to authorize a withdrawal.

				And so the saga continues...intersango don&#039;t seem to be doing gbp any more and my bank seem a bit clueless as to how to do a SEPA transfer anyway...<br />There&#039;s a seller on localbitcoins with 100% feedback, 750 trades...takes normal regular bank deposit. That seems like it might be the easiest way to do this - not gonna have the cash for a while anyway but I shall be prepared when the time comes!&nbsp; 8)

				localbitcoins.com is the best I have used. Takes a day for the payment to go through via SEPA, but it is by far the most straight forward. And, you can meet people locally, and pay cash. I would recommend it.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />
