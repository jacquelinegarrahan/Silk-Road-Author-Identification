				my friend seems to believe that because of where i and live and the very small post office my packages will be moving through might have the risk of being caught, hes only concerned about cannabis, he doesnt believe in mylar bags, i mean the smallest hole can ruin a perfect package, and from where its coming im sure it goes through 100 machines being thrown around. Does the community think im safe? he seems to believe that high quality cannabis will smell no matter what. I think different but i always like the communitys opinion&nbsp;

				If you use an established trusted vendor you will be fine.&nbsp; The smell can pass through the bags over time, but you have to have faith that these guys are pros.&nbsp; Small post office, or large post office shouldn&#039;t make a difference.&nbsp; Mail goes to a forward sorting area, shipping facility, processed close to you, and then off for delivery.&nbsp; The process shouldn&#039;t change that much for a small time.<br /><br />Order a small test if you are really concerned.&nbsp; Once you get a feel for the stealth involved you might feel more comfortable.

				Most of the vendors will double vacuum the product prior to delivery. Some will even work with you on a one on one case basis. If you are getting more than an ounce you could probably work some thing out with the vendor to have them use mylar and double vacuum ..... In any case I would say that the VAST majority of the weed dealers appreciate repeat business and it isn&#039;t in their best interest to put their customers at risk.&nbsp; Not to mention they don&#039;t want to look like amateurs when their customers give them a 4/5 feedback or stealth. Check the vendor page ......they almost always give details on shipping and stealth.

				Thats always a good thing to have drops, i like to have 3 or 4 at any time... and also, these trusted vendors are professional, i have tried ForeverJung, EastCoastCollective, Cearus, NoStress.&nbsp; and out of all of them, it was always double vacuum sealed, and could not be smelled through the package.&nbsp; &nbsp;i was very worried at first too, verrrrrry worried!! But i came on the forums, as you are, and was reassured.&nbsp; Just remember to use trusted vendors as someone else said, because indeed they are pros!!!&nbsp; The only one i wont use for bud again is nostress, the others were flawless!!

				Tell your friend to use the MBB bags or else he is risking you and himself. If he doesn&#039;t do that he is playing with your life.
