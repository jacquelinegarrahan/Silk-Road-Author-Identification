				Hi all,<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a noob question and that it&#039;ll probably piss some people off (sorry).<br /><br />But considering I buy my g of coke for approximately 45€ here (&quot;irl&quot;) and a pill of xtc exactly 5€ (whatever type I buy), why the heck is it so expensive here?<br /><br />Do you know any &quot;cheaper&quot; (for same quality) place than SK?

				That&#039;s because pill prices are cheap in the UK &amp; ROI. Where I live they cost less than £1 each. That&#039;s six or seven times cheaper than on SR. However pill prices in other countries may be higher than on SR which creates business for the vendors. <br /><br />People in the UK with no access to street price XTC will obviously order too. In some cases there&#039;s also drugs of better quality available here on SR than locally. Regardless of what street contacts you may have in some cases.

				I have to admit that it is pretty incredible to be able to know so much about the product you&#039;re buying on SK (name, quality, feedback from others, even lab tests) - info you usually don&#039;t have IRL.<br />And from where I&#039;m from (Belgium), SK prices for MDMA are also rather cheap (20-30€ vs. 40€ in clubs).<br /><br />But still, for CC and pills, it&#039;s ridiculously expensive... Even if you have guarantee for quality. Though I understand the reasons why now. But I guess SK is simply not interesting in my POV then... Too bad :(<br /><br />Also I wonder if there&#039;s a web-based forum for drug deals in your regions ! If such thing exist (that must exist...) please let us know =)<br /><br />Oh and what about the SK vendors that offer a g of CC for let&#039;s say 0,52BTC (e.g. from user http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/d45414deec ), is that &quot;possible&quot; or is it scam for sure?

				I got a shitty message from a guy in Australia bitching about the price I&#039;m charging for GBL.....<br /><br />He told me he could buy it for 1/3rd the price locally.&nbsp; So I told him, GREAT, go do that.&nbsp; Got flamed a bit afterwards.....<br /><br />Then I sent him a link to a recent news article outlining the price on the streets in various cities; and told him he&#039;s welcome to try and import the shit from china if he would like; followed by ANOTHER article of the 80% capture rate of Australian Customs with drug importation....<br /><br />There&#039;s still risk for SR vendors selling their wares. And with risk comes price.

				I&#039;ll not make it a secret, I&#039;ve set the prices about 100% more than I do on private forums with members that I know.<br /><br />Two reasons for that, the first is that I have competition on the other forums and because it&#039;s private I have mutual trust (and have met people from the forum) but yes reason 1. there is competition with others offering the same product at the same price and the same quality.<br />2. Because you will pay it! I only sell pharmacy grade quality, the best that I&#039;ve found (as I use it myself) and you&#039;re getting what I had to go through years of scammers and shit to find a reliable source, then I had to go through financial hardship for years and now, finally, I can afford to buy in bulk and I&#039;ll sell on to you - at the quality you expect, with the privacy you require.<br /><br />That&#039;s it really. But I like the formula.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had experience on public forums and it&#039;s a disaster, it&#039;s the most scammer filled hell-hole in existence. Plus you&#039;re competing with people offering (or claiming to offer) the same product at a cheaper price. There&#039;s certainly interest, yes, I&#039;ve found a few people on there that will pay a higher rate but in general I don&#039;t touch the place because it&#039;s horrendous.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had experience on private forums. They&#039;re places where everybody knows everybody else, everybody is dealing pure / best quality, you know what you&#039;re getting, it costs a bit more but it&#039;s brilliant. If you ever need sorted out and you&#039;re in financial hardship then the guy that&#039;s been dealing to you for 6-7 years online is going to know you&#039;re good for the money and front you the drugs until you&#039;re in good shape.<br /><br />Here is different again, I love SR because it has everything I want in terms of quality and privacy, I can GPG my address up, send it to somebody random and expect a delivery through the post soon (well one of the worse things is the delivery times I&#039;ve found on SR - I&#039;ll be posting everything same day). It has basically everything, while the private forums don&#039;t - and I know that when I buy something that I&#039;m going to get what I ordered and not something crap. Quality matters! Privacy matters! And SR simply provides the mechanism for feedback (so you can trust the buyers / sellers) and privacy (by being on Tor) and the people deliver the quality because they&#039;ll get bad feedback if they sell you a baggie of kitchen powder or ecstasy that proves to have no MD* on it on a test.<br /><br />The prices are fine, you&#039;re willing to pay them (I&#039;m willing to as well) and if you weren&#039;t willing to pay them then we would lower the prices.<br /><br />Also it&#039;s like $500 to just become a vendor, christ almighty!

				One needs to consider the silkroad fee, vendor fee, the cost of shipping, the cost of packaging, as well as the man hours sent responding to messages, printing labels, sending orders, and paying back refunds from scammers/people who legitimately didn&#039;t receive their product, as these are all going to be part of the price of drugs on this site. <br /><br />Even after all this, I, for one, don&#039;t mind paying a little extra for the luxury of choice (one can pick from different suppliers and different countries, rather than just the two locals numbers you have for that item who probably have the same supplier) and the ease of having products delivered to the door like a spoon off Amazon. <br /><br />I ask myself: &quot;Would I pay a little extra for a phone book of drug dealers from around the world?&quot; Most certainly.
