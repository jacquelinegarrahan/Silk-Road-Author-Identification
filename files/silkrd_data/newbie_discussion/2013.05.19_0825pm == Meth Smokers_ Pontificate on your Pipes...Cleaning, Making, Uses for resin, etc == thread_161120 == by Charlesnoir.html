				Hi and Thanks for your Interest, <br /><br />Thanks to SR, I have been able to purchase my supply from the safety and comfort of my own home and avoid the unsavory element of meth dealers and their hangers-on in my area.<br /><br />As such, I have not been able to &#039;compare notes&#039; as to any new ideas regarding the manufacture and maintenance of my equipment.&nbsp; <br /><br />I learned how to make my own pipes with glass test tubes and a blow torch.&nbsp; I initially learned this technique by someone instructing me to purchase the liquid air fresheners for cars found in most gas stations, dump the liquid and clean the glass tube making sure to remove of all traces of the air freshener.<br />From what I was told, it is widely known that blowing pipes from these is pretty much the only reason anyone buys them.&nbsp; Not wanting to draw any attention to myself, I decided that buying plain glass test tubes via e-Bay or Amazon was a more discreet way to go.&nbsp; <br /><br />My questions to anyone who would like to comment are:&nbsp; <br /><br />How often do you replace your pipe?<br />Do you clean it/them and with what method?<br />Have you found any uses for the burnt residue that accumulates?&nbsp; <br /><br />I have always been rather fastidious about my pipes and cannot stand to use them when they develop much residue.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I make new pipes for new batches and don&#039;t mix different varieties as I was told long ago that this could have unknown negative consequences.&nbsp; <br />I believed this at the time as I was a novice, and have not challenged this belief ever since. True or False?&nbsp; <br />I have occasionally soaked the old pipes in water, or boiled them in water, and then make ice cubes with the resulting liquid. These can either really pack a punch in coffee, or be just &#039;meh&#039;. <br /><br />Any comments/ideas would be really appreciated!<br />
