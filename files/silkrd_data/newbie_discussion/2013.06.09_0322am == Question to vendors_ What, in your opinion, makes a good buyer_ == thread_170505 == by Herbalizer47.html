				I am curious what, from a vendor&#039;s perspective, makes a good buyer. Or, at least, things to avoid to be considered a bad buyer. What I have gathered so far:<br /><br />-Provide a real name &amp; address to avoid shipping complications<br />-Finalize and leave feedback promptly after receiving the goods<br />-Don&#039;t leave less than 5/5 feedback unless there was a major issue with the shipment<br />-If issues do arise, always contact the vendor first before leaving feedback, making a passive-aggressive forum post about the issue<br />-Don&#039;t pester the vendor with frequent requests for updates due to slow shipping, etc. (within reason)<br /><br />What else should I keep in mind? What unusual/unexpected situations have you seen come up that are sometimes handled poorly by buyers, and how would you suggest handling them?<br /><br />In particular, I&#039;ve seen some conflicting opinions on FE. Personally I would never feel comfortable finalizing early even with reputable vendors, but I&#039;ve seen at least a couple vendors that request or even require it. How common is this? The general consensus on the buyers&#039; end seems to be that FE is a bad idea, but I&#039;m unsure what the general opinion is on the vendors&#039; end.

				Read their vendor page as well as the listing page completely . . .&nbsp; many more don&#039;t bother reading the pages than do.<br /><br />You had it pretty well covered &amp; then with the added; finalize within a day or so of receiving the order . . .&nbsp; vendors usually try to bust it to get your order out to you in a timely fashion, have the courtesy to get them their money in a timely fashion.<br /><br />NCK

				Sure, I&#039;ll definitely do that. I just placed one of my first orders from you, by the way, and I&#039;m super stoked for it!
