				People - be vigiliant and intelligent. There are many forum members who post here regularly, who have a wealth of information, who are eager with advice, and want to be our best friends. They claim they are privy to so much LE knowledge because they are &quot;former LE&quot;. Think about that for a second. Then think about that again. Former LEOs will NEVER admit, let alone repeat ad nauseam that they ARE former LEOs because they&#039;ll want to keep the nature of their drug habits/darknet activities as far away from their past lives as possible because they know the consequences more then anyone.<br />If they are former LEO&#039;s, who in good faith just want to hang on these forums and indulge in drugs etc, they will do everything they can to AVOID any reference to that part of their life (for fear of not being trusted by vendors or other forum members etc). But instead, to brazenly hammer it home that they are &quot;former LE&quot;, and then provide with a wealth of knowledge about everything under the sun from how CD&#039;s are done, how SWAT teams operate, how narcs operate, etc.. they gain trust and seem &quot;cool&quot;. They went from &quot;them&quot; to &quot;us&quot;, and describe Jason Bourne-esque escapadades. They develop cred. They&#039;re friendly. Even make a few buys. But occasionally they slip. Here&#039;s an exercise class : find one of these, click on &quot;View Posts&quot; and then go through their posts. Go through them looking at it from a removed point of view.&nbsp; Assume a little birdie told you they are not &quot;former&quot; at all and then read their posts.. and objectives become clear. Mistakes seem more obvious. Things that sound too good/cool to be true.. BECOME MORE APPARENT. Don&#039;t be stupid. Myself and my team are proud we blew the lid off the price-fixing scandal that got tacit aknowledgement from DPR.&nbsp; (Regardless of what your views on that were). There&#039;s a reason we are privy to things others aren&#039;t and have friends in high places (or the 7 Seas ;)) around this place. <br /><br />Go through their posts, and it makes more sense then you&#039;d like. Then go back to being vigilant.. complacency will be how they bring this place down. It wont be the technology, it will be the weakest link - humans.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen them post up in the other sections, offering that explanation on why they know so much and why you should listen to them.<br /><br />Perhaps post up a list of as many of the usernames as you can find, and the community can keep them under an additional level of &quot;scrutiny.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;d read through their posts but don&#039;t care to go looking that hard. Post up some links!

				SleepyEyes2k2.<br /><br />^Absolutely active LEO. Read his posts (hacking his way into LE-only forum and seeing SR forum usernames, having knowledge about everything to do with how LE operates, 12 years in the army then LE then suffered and injury and flipped his POV overnight and joined the other team, was SWAT Team but also street detective, said he had a few bullet proof vests for sale, very interested in TorChat/ICQ, etc). See where this is going? Read all of his posts from this logical perspective.<br />He becomes the cool guy on campus. We&#039;re calling this one. And so have people up the food chain :)<br /><br />Be vigiliant. PLEASE.

Just wait till he responds to this post.<br /><br />Modzi<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sorry Modzi.. did I do something to ruffle your feathers? Oh, perhaps I brought to DPR&#039;s attention what you and RxKing were attempting to do with an upcoming vendor who wanted to sell Oxydone at a discount price and you guys not only decided to price-fix, but you also tried to buy him out privately to keep the prices of Oxy artificially inflated? Are you still mad about that, and how DPR (in addition to his private response to me.. which out of respect I will NOT reproduce here) addressed the issue and verified that you idiots were trying to price fix the price of painpills and Nod and his band of jews were trying to pricefix coke? Dont be mad at that. I am trying to do this community a service by calling out someone &quot;SleepyEyes2k2&quot; who claims to be former LEO, but is still active LEO and has been making some extremely bizarre overtures towards vendors via PM. Suffice it to say I am &quot;in the know&quot; and act in this community&#039;s best interest. <br />Now, go back to selling your $36 Oxycodones (LOL, might as well charge $50. Fellow vendors giggle at how you must think your pills are hand crafted by Purdue Pharma and have traces of #TigerBlood in them, either that or you&#039;re a dumbass vendor paying retail and flipping them for $6 profit. Sucker. Those prices are a steal buddy. Great business model you have. Other vendors are making a killing while you&#039;re moving 100 blues a month, and then have the gall to try to buy out a new guy offering up $18 dollar pills).<br /><br />Anyways I digress. Be VIGILANT. There are cops here and they want to be everyones best friend. Do not speak to them on PM, do NOT SPEAK TOTHEM on TorChat, and DO NOT talk to them about vendors&#039; stealth! That includes pricks like Modzi! Just be vigilant.<br /><br />Btw Modzi, Nod, RxKing - how&#039;d that price fixing scandal work out for you?<br />Modzi - How&#039;s the Dungeons and Dragons going? And your 40 dollar, stained ol pills work for ya?<br />Nod - How&#039;s the $400 dollar gram of coke thats adulterated with 15% levamisole going?<br />RxKing - How&#039;s having your tongue buried up DPR&#039;s ass going for you? I understand Asians have a hard time seeing IRL.. but atleast have the foresight online to realize that bragging about &quot;being a vendor for ova a year and 300 customo&#039;z can&#039;t be wong!&quot; does not mean you have to constantly prostate yourself before DPR&#039;s nuts any chance u get! He no love you long time! He find it annoying!<br /><br />Anywayz, back 2 the point. People - be vigiliant. These are trying times.

				I would not be surprised to learn there are not only LE operatives on the forums, but also LE posing as bulk sellers trying to mail to dealers buying stock. If you&#039;re buying lots of bulk, I hope for your sake you have more a more sophisticated system going on than a home address, a secure linux build, tor and PGP.
