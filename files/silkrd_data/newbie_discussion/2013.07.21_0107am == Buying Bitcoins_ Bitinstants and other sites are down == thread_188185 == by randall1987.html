				BitInstant and all the other web sites I know of are not taking buy orders right now. They all have messages about being temporarily down or having legal troubles. <br /><br />Anyone know of a way to buy coins right now?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				There are an assload of listings on SR where you can exchange MoneyPaks for bitcoins, and vice versa. Just look under the &quot;Money&quot; category.

				I used localbitcoins last night for the first time.&nbsp; I paid a little more than I would have with Bitinstant, but it was quick and safe with the escrow system in place.

				If you&#039;re trying to sell BTC to people, you&#039;re going to need to do it on SR, with a vendor account.<br /><br />There&#039;s a reason they make you put down a deposit.<br /><br />It provides security to the buyers.

				I wound up trying coinbase.com. Just a small order of less than 10 coins, even though it seems like a legit service.<br /><br />

				Best thing to do is establish a relationship with someone who has a good supply of coins.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up two methods for anonymously buying bitcoins and moving them to the Road.<br /><br />You do not have to order the guide; the information is contained directly in the listing itself, which is at:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting the info in my listing rather than here in the forums is that methods of obtaining <br />bitcoins change from day-to-day. <br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />I&#039;ve used the procedures outlined in this guide--in the USA--many times with no problems.<br /><br />Peace,<br />MedicineWoman<br /><br />
