				I&#039;ve been an active member of SR for almost a year now, with substantial buyers stats. I&#039;ve trawled the forums regularly, looking for advice, information and general entertainment, but never felt like registering.<br />Now I have a question that I&#039;m hoping some of you might be able to help me with.<br />I&#039;ve always enjoyed taking codeine-based pain meds in the past and started extracting the good stuff regularly last year, to the point where I noticed withdrawal symptoms coming on when I had a break.&nbsp; <br />I managed to get some Oxycodone (Endone 5mg tabs) from a Dr and then started shopping around for more scripts. I had nothing wrong with me, but a good knowledge of medicine, coupled with some great performances made it almost too easy to get. I have what many would describe as a high-profile job, which earns good money and certainly doesn&#039;t put me in the classic drug-seeking stereotype - which, I have come to realise is a great load of shit.<br />Of course 5mg oxy&#039;s quickly become totally unsatisfactory and I was taking 15-20 tabs at a time, so I started buying 40 and 80mg OxyContins and munching those each day. I stole blank prescriptions from the Dr and crafted ways of getting them without much problem.<br />Fast forward to last month and I started ordering No4 H off SR from a very reputable seller that clients assure me sells some of the best H around.&nbsp; I only snort it, but right from the start was taking up to 50mg a go, up to 8 times a day. <br />Why is my tolerance so high?&nbsp; It&#039;s costing me $1000 per week just to keep steady, while long term IV addicts claim a 15-25mg shot of the same gear gets them nodding and 1g lasts a few days?<br /><br />I&#039;ve only been taking Oxy and H for 5 months, so WTF?<br /><br />Any ideas welcome.<br /><br />My gratitude to you all.<br />

				Truth be told, I never used drugs, but I would guess that you are affected by one of two things:<br />1. Your body simply &#039;got used&#039; to the drugs. Kind of like how some bugs grow more resistant to pesticide, your body might have found a way to &#039;fight&#039; off the effects of the drug (the chemicals of the drug, after all, do all kinds of fucked up things to our internal system which causes us to get high. we might like it but to our bodies, its a big no-no). <br />2. You&#039;re just naturally tolerant to that drug. For example, the first time I attempted to get drunk, it took me 6 back to back shots of vodka to make me even feel remotely tipsy. Not even absinth does anything substantial. Maybe you should try a different drug?<br /><br />Again, I have no idea what I&#039;m talking about, it just sounds logical to me

				Are you serious??? You are addicted my friend, that&#039;s it. Your tolerance goes up naturally the more you do, the more it takes.&nbsp; I had a hell of a habit myself back in the OC days, B4 they changed them to those OP pieces of shit. I was doing 12-15 80&#039;s a day. I wound up going to a clinic and getting on suboxone . That stuff works pretty good but I would advise using it for no more than like a month and then getting off them. I was on subs for about 3 years and holy shit are they hard to get off , especially after that long. For me anyway, suboxone was INCREDIBLY hard to kick, I should have just dealt with the oxy withdrawals because I think the sub WD&#039;s are much worse and they last a lot longer.&nbsp; I now do opiates again but just here and there, I try not to let myself do them more than like 3 days in a row. Opiate addiction is a real bitch...be careful.
