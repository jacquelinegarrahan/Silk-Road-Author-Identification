				You weren&#039;t looking hard enough... Just joined yesterday and found all the great info already :)<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ &lt;--- buy them via transfer, or cash money, I think sometimes they even accept paypal. Needless to say, only cash can be anonymous enough.<br /><br />Optionally clean them through Bitcoinfog http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/ , though it&#039;s not really necessary if you bought it for cash I guess.<br /><br />Deposit to your SR account.

				Go to https://blockchain.info/ and create a wallet. Save your bitcoin address. You could search online for your local bitcoin seller. There are BTC seller who online sell online (you could pay using paypal, prepaid visa, etc), and there are sellers who actually have physical shops where you could just go there and pay with cash. There are many methods to be anonymous, just read the topic in the forum. If you go to a shop, just bring your BTC address barcode, and the seller will transfer the BTC and print you the proof of transfer. Then go to your wallet and transfer to your appointed SR BTC address. You could tumble it first if you&#039;re paranoid.

				It would be cool if a mod made a detailed thread about this for beginners. This was the only thing I had questions about when I started and it&#039;s hard to find good answers. Most of the typical ways people buy bitcoin are shit for one reason or another. Like Bitinstant for example. That service is horrible and slowly but surely is compromising anonymity. Using any exchange compromises anonymity as well since you have to link a bank account or provide ID.

				Agree, I had the most problem with these steps too.<br /><br />But still, I don&#039;t think buying via bank transfer is all that bad, you just have to tumble the coins enough before they get to SR.

				I just read about this site called local bitcoins where you meet someone locally to buy bitcoin. Yet another shit way to buy bitcoin since it compromises anonymity for both parties.

				local bitcoin seems ok but one day you&#039;re going to be meeting LE somewhere somehow...<br /><br />Whats up with bitinstant? I used them for about 3-4k worth of deposits and now I&#039;m hearing they are not good to use because they ask for all this personal information and shit? <br /><br />What a bunch of assholes. <br /><br />Bitfloor was awesome but they are now shut down as well.&nbsp; There&#039;s no more good quick BTC exchanges like bitinstant or bitfloor that are realitively cheap and quick? <br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing moneypak/REloadiit with SR venders but the % rates are so damn high + if you send them your pack code and they just take your money, there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.&nbsp;

				And what happens if you meet LE IRL, or if you see someone&#039;s face?<br /><br />Bitcoins are legal. Lots of these people selling and buying are serious traders, who just make some extra with overpriced local transactions. I know a guy like this, goes all around buying and selling coins, and he doesn&#039;t even do drugs, doesn&#039;t care about SR and won&#039;t even install TOR.

				Profiling? What the hell, man? You think they have the resources to randomly try to pick on average bitcoin buyers? :)<br /><br />As the OP just wants to make some purchases, I don&#039;t think he&#039;s buying coins for like thousands of dollars, but I can be wrong of course.<br /><br />But I would literally buy small amounts like 5 coins from a police officer in uniform.

				Well, you replied to my post regarding an IRL meeting, that&#039;s why... :)<br /><br />Now, I get what you&#039;re saying. But from a small time buyer&#039;s perspective... I don&#039;t think there&#039;s ever going to be a problem because someone somewhere has seen my bank account. The coins went to a 3rd party wallet, then to Bitcoinfog, then divided into multiple transactions before arriving to SR. And we&#039;re talking about 100 bucks here.<br /><br />I wish them good luck for their profiling :)

				With localbitcoins you can just do cash deposit at a bank. They keep your coins in escrow and when you make the deposit the seller releases your coins. Just did this a few days ago. It was very easy and had my coins about ten minutes after I got back from the bank.

				The whole purpose of using bitcoin as the currency on SR is to keep the transactions 100% anonymous. Anything you do that compromises that anonymity is counter intuitive and should be avoided. The owner of that website has access to and is responsible for all of the transaction data. A hacker could gain access to that data too. Also, have you heard about PRISM? Also, have you heard about FBI profiles? Also, have you heard about LE profiles? Another thing you may not have thought about is local competition.

				it is pretty unsettling to see how much effort the people in charge are going to just to keep detailes about people, there are plenty of things to do with bitcoins but i have to wonder if that matters since one of the big things to do with it is a international drug trade and gov agencies like to keep as close to a monopoly on importing as they can from what i hear. i expect interesting tax issues to come from all this

It&#039;s unfortunate that news headlines don&#039;t read things like &quot;Enjoy loosing your 5th amendment rights? How about your 4th? Your 3rd?&quot;. Then it would be more clear to the people who seem to not be paying attention. Everyone starts out in the newbie forum to ask questions and to build up enough posts to be able to post in the other sections. Even the drug dealers buying hundreds in coins.

				Well, not everyone is from the land of the free.<br /><br />I worked for a cell provider for years, and believe me: when LE contacts the provider for cell details in connection to a serious crime, there is usually none (but yes, they do store your location and call details for up to 2 years). Cause people know this stuff and don&#039;t take their cells with them on shady deals :D<br /><br />And make up your mind already, in the other topic, you were stating &quot;You don&#039;t need to clean your transaction chain.&quot;... Believe me, doing this through bitcoinfog way more beneficial than were you&#039;re getting your perfectly legal bitcoins, before anonymizing and tainting them ;)<br /><br />If a (wannabe) drug dealer is buying coins for the first time, yet he is not aware of the most fundamental basics, he&#039;s a liability, he&#039;s compromising the community and should know better.

What I said in that other topic was that you do not need to tumble your coins before you send them to your SR bitcoin wallet because SR already tumbles transactions that go in and out of SR. That&#039;s not related though, because when you buy your coins 100% anonymously and use a new bitcoin address, you don&#039;t need to worry about tumbling them. My point is to remain anonymous. A lot of the posts about how to buy bitcoin suggest you compromise your anonymity in one way or another. Under informed and misinformed posts about stuff that is important like how to buy bitcoins, that&#039;s a danger to the community. The whole purpose of using bitcoin as the currency on SR is to keep the transactions 100% anonymous. Anything you do that compromises that anonymity is counter intuitive and should be avoided. Even a wannabe drug dealer would still need to ask questions in these topics and read these topics to learn the basics.
