				Been waiting 15 days (13 after processing) for a local bulk order that I was told should take no more than 7. After ten, I grew concerned of interception and PMd the vendor, asking when they sent it, and instead of answering my question, they (falsely) assured me it would be on my doorstep in 24-48 hours, aka, no later than yesterday, AKA, &quot;I&#039;m sending the shit as I type this message.&quot; <br /><br />Assuming it even gets here (I still believe it will based on vendors rating, but doubt it&#039;ll even be here by tomorrow, day 16), and assuming it is in tact, does this vendor deserve a pristine rating (5/5)? If the product ultimately arrives as advertised and in good health but just takes what could only be described as &quot;WAAAAY TOO LONG&quot; to be delivered, should that not weigh on the feedback?? What are MY moral obligations as an honest buyer to both the vendor and the community??? Feedback is appreciated. <br /><br />~DFG~

				Just give honest feedback. If you think it deserves a 4/5 so be it.<br />It might be out of the vendor his hands though...

				this is what i dont really like about the rating system. 5/5 is good and everything else is considered bad in the eye of vendors. 4/5 is still a very good rating, its just not perfect. it sounds like your experience hasnt been perfect but assuming you get your product and its as described you will be happy. a 4/5 sounds fair to me. does it say in the vendor profile you must contact them before leaving anything besides a 5/5 so they have a chance to &quot;fix&quot; the problem? you risk the chance of a vendor not dealing with you again because you left something besides a 5/5 which i consider bullshit. <br />i leave the feedback i think fairly describes my experience. if i leave less then 5/5 i always include why in the comments as well as the positive aspects.&nbsp; &nbsp;keep in mind that this gig is usually the way a vendor pays his bills and eats and ratings/feedback should be taken seriously as it can &quot;make or break&quot; a vendor. that being said, if we are not honest, rating out of fear or intimidation, the entire system goes to shit.

				If the vender legitimately sent it on the right day really you shouldn&#039;t really give bad f/b because it was done on time and a problem in the postal system. But this always happens meaning shit cunts fucking up good venders stats.
