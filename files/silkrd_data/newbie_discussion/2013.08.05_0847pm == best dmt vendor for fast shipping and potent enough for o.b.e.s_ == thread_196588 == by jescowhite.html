				Looking for replies from people who have bought dmt, not vendors, actual experience. They wanna make this shit blasts them into other dimensions. last dmt i had i wasnt very impressed at all, very weak visuals, obe was outta the question.<br />Some of my buddies are looking to take a final voyage soon and one of them is a artist. He really wants to get the best dmt experience possible, leave body, entity communitation,&nbsp; enter uncharted dimensions, etc, the best possible for art inspiration, he thinks this is gonna take his art to the next level, and i dont doubt it as dmt is a great tool for this. So if anyone can help recommend me which vendor gets it to you the fastest who has the best quality and some decent prices. note: dont worry, i already know not to buy from a vendor account. if your into heroin, im looking for a dmt dealer that is as reliable and is as good as gotsitall for heroin, if youve went through him youd know what i mean, basically anyone that ships fast and reliable and has bomb dmt, any help would be appreciated as i wanna get my friends the best asap, If i get replies, ill look over them in a bit and make a choice from there as im bouncing on and off the computer making some mashing up some corn whiskey, thanks to anyone that helps me find what im looking for~

				DeemzBeemz ... Hands down one of the best DMT vendors I&#039;ve ordered from.&nbsp; His product is of the highest quality and his shipping is stupid quick.&nbsp; Takes 1-2 days to get to east coast for me.&nbsp; You want hyper space?&nbsp; It&#039;ll get you there in a quickness.

				Awesome thanks for the advice, Im tempted to take the journey with my buddies also but im currently on the methadone program, i used to love hallucinogens before i got dependent on opiates due to getting on probation for marijuana possession, opes were the easiest to get away with n i got hooked back in the day, now im not sure how id react to hallucinogens, being on methadone, not sure if id get the full experience or not and not sure if it may antagonize or metabolize the methadone faster/put me in a bad place. Ill have to do some research before I decide, anyway thanks for the tip.

				The best vender is yourself, your mental frame containing the omnipresent is the most potent
