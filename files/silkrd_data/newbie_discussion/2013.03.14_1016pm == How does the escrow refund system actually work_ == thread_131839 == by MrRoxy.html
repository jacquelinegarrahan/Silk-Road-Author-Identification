				Thankfully I have yet to have an issue in 15 - 20 or so odd buys. Though how does the refund system actually work? If a package is sent with a tracking number and marked as delivered but you never received it (maybe delivered elseware?) are you completely screwed out of a refund? How about items with no tracking number, it seems to be a &#039;your word against his&#039; issue, in which, how is the matter resolved then?<br /><br />Thanks!

				This is a good question that I hope someone will answer. While one never hopes for there to be a problem its all ways nice to know how it will be handled if there is one.

				If you look at sellers policies it usually says 50% refund if you have good buying stats. If you can&#039;t come to a resolution with the seller you have to talk to the SR staff I think let them decide what to do as they still have control of your coins. I don&#039;t have first hand experience of this however.

				it&#039;s done on a case by case basis. you and the vendor will try and reach an amicable decision through resolution but if you can&#039;t then sr support step in and make a decision for you.
