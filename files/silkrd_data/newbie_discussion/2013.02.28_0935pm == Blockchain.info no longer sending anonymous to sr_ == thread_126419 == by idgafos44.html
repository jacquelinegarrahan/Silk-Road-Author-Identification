				Blockinfo was using Bitinstant and ZipZap for anonymous transactions,&nbsp; but that has stopped.<br /><br />These companies now seem to&nbsp; requiring and logging email, name and dob,&nbsp; ad this seems to be<br />subjected to ID check.&nbsp; Some people seem to pass without problem but some people have received <br />ID error on small ( $100-250) transactions in spite of no obvious risk factors.&nbsp; Their website <br />indicates they may run background checks or check name against &quot;Lists&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fucking nuts to<br />do business with them.&nbsp; Using site gives right them the right to validate you ID,&nbsp; keep reports of <br />your activity, analyze it for indications of illegal activity,&nbsp; &nbsp;and sell info to others.&nbsp; I&#039;d just as soon go <br />to my bank and tell them to wire $500 -$1000 to someone like MtGox&nbsp; for investment in Bitcoin.<br /><br />Note that most people do not get the ID error,&nbsp; but they are still logging transactions.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From Bitinstant.com website.<br /><br />In order for you to make a Transaction payment, we need from you your: (i) first name; (ii) last name; (iii) mobile telephone number, together with an SMS confirmation of the same; and (iv) the last four digits of your social security number. If you wish to make a Transaction that is in excess of $1,000.00 or Transactions that, in a single day, exceed $1,000.00 in the aggregate, then we will also need from you: (v) a copy of government-issued photo ID; and (vi) a copy of a utility bill. The purpose for collecting this information is to maintain BitInstant compliance with applicable laws that require BitInstant to verify that its Services are not being used for illegal purposes to, for example, facilitate in money laundering or the funding of terrorism.<br /><br />While we will accept Transaction payments for only those Merchants and in those amounts designated by you, from time to time, we want to be sure that you have a pre-existing relationship (i.e. the Customer Merchant Agreement) with the Merchant from whom we are taking a payment. To that end, you allow us to obtain all information that a Merchant may maintain concerning you, so that we can be sure that you (i) have a relationship with the Merchant; and (ii) your identification information provided to us matches that that you have provided to the Merchant. We need this ability to protect you, us and Merchants from fraud and in order to comply with applicable laws.<br /><br />YOU EXPRESSLY GRANT THE RIGHT TO COLLECT, STORE AND DISCLOSE ALL NON-PUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION IDENTIFIED ABOVE, TOGETHER WITH TRANSACTION AMOUNTS AND MERCHANT IDENTIFICATION AS WELL AS INFORMATION IN POSSESION OF MERCHANTS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE IN BITINSTANT&#039;S SUPPLY OF THE SERVICES AND IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.<br /><br />BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU REPRESENT THAT BITINSTANT IS AUTHORIZED COLLECT, STORE AND DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IN THIS APPLICATION AND INFORMATION ABOUT YOU PERSONALLY, INCLUDING BY REQUESTING REPORTS FROM CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES IN ORDER TO ASSESS YOUR SUITABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES AND THE ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH BITINSTANT.<br /><br />BitInstant reserves the right to carry out a background check on you.<br /><br />Its gone from Anonymous for small amounts, to We collect your information,&nbsp; may run background checks <br />and will disclose this info to unknown agencies.&nbsp; I suspect that even if you pass the ID test, they still keep info on you<br />that could be disclosed for no reason.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;This seems very invasive to me,&nbsp; and I can think of no reason do business with them.

				Just buy bitcoins with your ID or whatever and send them to an online wallet or two that is from a different site than the one you had to give out personal info to. From that wallet send the money to a new account on bitcoinfog. From bitcoinfog send the BTC to SR. Use a proxy/tor for as much of this process as you can. Getting anonymous coins on SR is still trivially easy.

				My concern is them looking for illegal usage patterns in purchases to acquire Bitcoins,&nbsp; but think Spain and other market forces will provide cover, esp f you can buy $1000 in bitcoins instead of a series of $200 purchases.<br /><br />After you but them,&nbsp; it will be very difficult to track your usage.&nbsp; You can always lose your money gambling..<br /><br />42

				I sent almost $500.00 to bitinstant the monday after they got hacked a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I knew their website had been down all weekend but I didn&#039;t know why.&nbsp; Had I known they had been hacked I would have never sent my money to them.&nbsp; LOOOOONG story short, I got my BTC finally after emailing them a new BTC address... <br /><br />I thought if I say, put an order in with binstant right now and gave them my btc address, than go put another 500.00 order in with another company or whatever, I should be able to change my BTC address and still have transaction(s) go through yes? OR do you we have to keep the address the same until funds are deposited??<br /><br />**I came this close to spreading bad press/contacting press/bloggers about Bitinstant since I felt that would be more damaging to them than filing some crap in small claims court.&nbsp; In the end I did loose out on a bunch of money. I mean they had about half my investment money for SR and it took FOREVER for me to get my BTC... Thank god I had established a relationhip with a great seller who kept cutting me the same breaks even though I wasn&#039;t getting usual quantity...<br /><br />I USE BITFLOOR.COM now and they&#039;re great!&nbsp; I deposit cash into any bank O amerika (I think if its under $1000.00 they do not ask for ID but I&#039;m not sure about that).&nbsp; I&#039;ve had no problems at all, they&#039;ve never once asked me for an ID.<br /><br />Just this last time she asked me for a name and I gave my usual go-to fake name but I think I saw her filling it in in a little box that I missed or something. Will pay closer attention next time, will go to a different bank, and will set up a whole new account on bitfloor.&nbsp; I&#039;m using ALL fake information the whole way with @MailInator.com / tor browsers.&nbsp; I do have to go to public wi-fi spots to access bitfloor. Even when I allow scripts some things (alot of things) don&#039;t show up.&nbsp; the ONLY problem and tricky part with BitFloor is the trading of your USD for BTC .. the USD shows up in&nbsp; your account on bitfloor very very quickly and you can trade for BTC as soon as you want but you want to MAKE SURE you put a limit on what you&#039;re willing to spend on BTC... I didn&#039;t set a limit my first time because I was in a huge hurry (was running like 2 weeks late) and I lost about $54.00 in literally seconds... If you don&#039;t set a limit it will charge you whatever the most expensive bitcoin has sold for at that time.&nbsp; I just look to see what the last group of BTC sold for and set my limit to that number or like a penny more... I don&#039;t want to wait around to see if somebody will accept my offer, I want my BTC ASAP so I&#039;ll spend a hair more than other people I guess.&nbsp; After you&#039;ve traded and you own x amount of btc on bitfloor you can then send them where ever you want; you can wash them multiple times, send them to a wallet etc.. Because I use ALL fake names etc.. I send them straight to SR and change accounts (with bitfloor) every 1000.00 or so... Does anybody see a problem with this? I am I playing it too loose? <br /><br />In the near future I will have person I pay to deposit money<br />Person receives items already gets money<br />I handle all online stuff and $$ via tor browsers and public internet spots like hotel parking lots, starbucks etc..&nbsp;

				Sorry, I should have clarified - I was using blockchain&#039;s &quot;send shared&quot; service to transfer to a 3rd party wallet. The transfer from that wallet into SR only took a couple of hours.

				Oh, okay.&nbsp; Yeah, my understanding is that with send shared, your coins go into a pool which may or may not be large enough to mix your coins.&nbsp; If there aren&#039;t enough other coins in the pool, then you have to wait until there are before the transaction(s) go through.

				Yeah, from what I&#039;ve read that&#039;s exactly how it works...&nbsp; I was just a little surprised how long it took because I was only sending a small amount (&lt;3 BCT). <br /><br />

				That&#039;s pretty surprising!&nbsp; Then again, blockchain.info has been having a lot of technical issues recently -- nothing with btc missing or anything, but trouble with the website, the servers, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that it took that long for your transaction due to one of those errors.&nbsp; Who knows!&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s always best to send btc a day or two before you know you&#039;ll be needing them.
