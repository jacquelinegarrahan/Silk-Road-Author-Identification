				ya get the coke and put it it a pot and then put in da pot some ammonia and heat the mixture to 100 degrees celcius ....and after a few mins keep stirrin it around and along the edges you will see some sludge and then its nearley ready then just mix it aroung for a few more mins and then strain the mixture in a sieve and then there will be crystals ( CRACK )

				Its the simplest drug to cook up, Just remember always use the unperfumed ammonia, never the perfumed one or bicarb thats just makes shit. <br /><br />I use a large ladel and camping stove, but that depends on how much coke you got to cook up really, its always advisable to start small and only cook it up half gram at the time if ya donno what your doing. <br /><br />Anyways, always add the ammonia first, enough to comfortably cover the amount of coke you wanna cook, it wont hurt to have too much, you just got more liquid to evap off and fish through <br /><br />add your coke to the ammonia, some people heat a lot others dont, My advice is that you don´t need a lot of heat at all you´ll see the reaction happening in front of ya so you can be the judge really. <br /><br />So what you have so far, is a spoon with ammonia in it and some coke (small amount remember) floating around in it. the whole thing will go a milky color, then you add heat, (think heating up heroin style) so heat up the spoon from underneath till its just under simmering. then youll see like lines of clear goo forming, thats your crackalack being born. heat a little bit more. Then let it cool and its fishing time, go find your big crackalack rocks in the sludge. The art to making humungous yellow rocks is not to move the mixture whilst heating and always a gentle heat. <br /><br />then your got a choice, either keep cooking up in the same ammonia so you dont waste the tiiiny little rocks you cant fish out. or dump the ammonia onto tinfoil each time and let it evap, either way you´ll get all the little bits out, in my opinion the baby ones taste better. <br /><br />Go forth and prosper, you just mastered the art of breeding crack rocks.
