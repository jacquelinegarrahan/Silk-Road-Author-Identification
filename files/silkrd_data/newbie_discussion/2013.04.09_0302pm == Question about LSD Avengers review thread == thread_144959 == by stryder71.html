				Hi everyone.<br />I love the idea of the avengers thread because it&#039;s too easy to get burned over your LSD orders, especially regarding dosage vs price. I&#039;m finding it a very useful thread and I&#039;m using it to whittle down my shortlist of vendors to do business with.<br />My question is though, for anybody who knows, what is the scoring system used on this thread? <br />For example on jerseycow&#039;s review they have put:<br />Trip Test Gandalf 3/10: ~150ug<br />Lab Test Gandalf 4/4: 141ug and 146ug<br />And for Subtickle they have put:<br />Chem Test 2/25:<br />Trip Test 2/25: ~160ug<br /><br />Now I&#039;m assuming that the trip test refers to someone who has tripped using these tabs and made an estimate based on their level of experience but what is the 3/10, 4/4 and 2/25 score? I can&#039;t figure it out but I&#039;m sure it will help me to make my choices.<br /><br />Such a shame that none of the STAR vendors have any in stock at the moment, but that gives me extra faith in them if they sell so quickly.<br /><br />Anyway guys, thanks for reading this and I hope you can help to clear this up for me.<br />I got burned by premium dutch with around 50mc&#039;s sold as 150&#039;s. It&#039;s so hard to get the correct strength LSD for the right price on SR. I used to get 100mc&#039;s for 2 pounds in 2008 but that was the only time I ever knew someone selling, shame times have changed so dramatically.<br /><br />Here&#039;s to more efficient shopping on the old silk road

				Yes those are the dates tested.<br /><br />I know the lure of ordering from STAR vendors gets the best of lots of people looking to place last minute or un planed orders, buts LOTS, of the OK vendors are just as good in many ways.<br /><br />&nbsp;If your set on only ordering with the STARS, youll have to load your coin, and keep up to date with their vendor profiles in order to catch the Love. <br /><br />Shit, 3Jane and Albion, ive seen sell out thousands of hits, in mere minutes. Best of luck friend.
