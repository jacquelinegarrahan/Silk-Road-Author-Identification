				I haven&#039;t taken solid mdma in 10 years. I think I&#039;m gonna grab half a gram and split it with a friend or two. <br /><br />So I don&#039;t want to stay up all night, and from what I remember of E I cannot sleep for shit if taken late in the evening. I was thinking about getting either a) some ghb, b) some lorazepam, c) something advised by the community, and taking it an hour or two before I want to try to call it a night. I understand the risks of mixing depressants/&quot;downers&quot; with MDMA, but I&#039;m only talking about a small dose at the end of the night. <br /><br />I&#039;m guessing that I&#039;ll get a lot of advice just to ride it out, but I was hoping someone would have a counterargument to that.

				I take some vitamin c, a, and other anti oxidants pre-roll. I also take them when I get home from rolling. 5-HTP is another supplement I take after I roll. If i have trouble sleeping, i just roll up a joint. Happy rolling!

				Nah dude, the E pills your remembering where prob loaded with other goodies, most of which keep you from sleeping. Raw mdma, is almost a downer in it self, well with all the yawns and eye fluttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;Keep a benzo handy IF you for some reason can not sleep at the end of your night. idk if you take benzos as is, but if you dont, 1mg xanax should put you right out. <br /><br />Shit when i roll, on the rare occasion, im ready to hit the sheets for a night of mdma dreams just as soon as im done peaking. Also lots and lots of weed helps sooo much, less is needed if its two hit shit, Much love dude.

				Yeah, I definitely second the benzo idea and the pot one.&nbsp; The other thing that I try to do is to take a bit earlier than normal.&nbsp; So if you start at 10 instead of midnight, you can sleep by about 4 instead of 6, which doesn&#039;t sound like much, but it&#039;s the difference between the sun coming up and not!&nbsp;

				I would personally advise valium as its got a long half life and will keep you asleep. I find mdma tends to stop me from sleeping even if it is pure, however the speed and meth its sometimes cut with makes it 10x worse, and also when i do wake up at about 12pm i still cant sleep and i end up feeling like shit the whole day. <br />This is from experience of taking pills and mandy over the span of 4 years, and let me tell you i dont go out of my way to take it anymore for the fact of how badly it fucks me up and the buzz in my opinion isn&#039;t worth it. <br />But you&#039;ve got a fun loved up night a head so have fun!

				Cool, thanks for the responses. I took quite a lot of different &quot;ecstasy&quot; presses and capsules, but I have no idea which were pure MDMA (if any). I&#039;ve had some nights that seemed never ending and some that weren&#039;t SO bad. I ended up quitting it because of the hangovers and cumulative effect of just doing it too much. <br /><br />This time I plan on putting a little more thought into supplements and whatnot. I&#039;m pretty experienced with benzos, and I would probably choose valium over xanax for a variety of reasons. My routine back in my MDMA days was always to power through the nights and load up on whatever opiate i could find the next day. It got me hooked on opiates, and I always associated opiates with alleviating any sort of negative feeling after that routine.

				Take vitamin C before (during if you can) and after. I usually take at least 1000mg several times a day before rolling and after. This is due to the fact that antioxidants can exit your system fairly quickly so it doesnt hurt to be careful. If your molly is clean and you dont take an absurd amount, you should sleep fairly well. If you feel tweaky or restless after, go ahead and take some 5htp (dont take it during because some forms of 5htp can kill your roll) and you should sleep just fine.

				Good cannabis. I actually prefer it the day after more than the comedown. After I&#039;ve slept and eaten a good amount the next day, weed is so feel good for the 24 hours post roll.<br /><br />I have heard very positive things about GHB on the mdma comedown, but have not tried it myself.

				1: Any Drug that hits your GABA receptors: Alcohol/benzos/GHx etc<br />2: Weed.<br />3: Strong antihistamines like Serqual or Mirtazapine.<br />4: Good herbs are Valerian, Passion flower, Licorice and lavender.<br />There&#039;s clearly more but those are the most effective, and of course your vitamins and especially magnesium for the jaw and muscles.<br />ALLWAYS PRELOAD. Your high is better, the comedown more pleasant and less damage done to your body.

				Weed is good but it usually doesn&#039;t relieve the anxiety and antsy-ness. It actually makes it worse. IF your coming off of the molly and haven&#039;t slept since you dosed, your headspace is still already altered so weed won&#039;t get you much high.&nbsp; A solid dose of opiates will definately bring on a different kind of euphoria different from mdma and will help you relax and not feel so &#039;blue&#039;. A solid dose of benzos, however, is the cure all for any drug.<br />Can&#039;t offer any imput on ghb for mdma comedowns as I&#039;ve only taken it on its own. It never made me sleep for any substantial period of time.
