				unfortunately, i can&#039;t help you out with any personal experience<br />i considered ordering with BoyMaster, because he seems to be the only one who&#039;s actually selling amphetamine sulphate - compared to all those vendors, that sell paste<br />if your health is any consideration for you, i wouldn&#039;t touch that last one<br />i decided to wait, until someone is going to sell dextroamphetamine for a reasonable price, but for now BM seemed to be a legit vendor...

				amphetamine paste is nothing more but adulterants that are being added to toxic &amp; uncleaned amphetamine base. <br />you can identify it easily by it&#039;s moist &amp; clumpy appearance, as well by it&#039;s penetrating smell of cleaning agent. <br />also it is drying in nothing more but a few minutes (if the paste were pure unadulterated amph base it would never dry that fast). <br />And when paste dries, a lot of the amph base material is evaporating along with the adulterants. just let some dried paste sit for a few days, and you would see it having almost no effect anymore - compared to amphetamine salt, which is pretty stable material.<br /><br />real amphetamine for &quot;consumption&quot; (like in pharmaceuticals) has to be finished by making it into a sulfate, that is, the salt of sulfuric acid.<br />that&#039;s an important cleaning step, that is not being done with base, and can also not be done afterwards because the base is already suspended in those adulterants - so this stuff most certainly is not being sold by accident where someone just forgot to do the final process, but quite deliberately.<br /><br />i guess most vendors may not even know this themselves, and are just selling whatever they can stock - the problem are the manufacturers who try to make easy money at the expense of our health - and unfortunately it seems their plan is working out well, as some people seem to be snorting almost every shit they can get their hands on without thinking twice.<br />something has got to be done about this stuff!!

				Boymaster seems to have the most and best reviews, but he&#039;s a little expensive, I&#039;ve used Best Dutch Drugs a few times, great speed, fast EU delivery and good value.

				Feedback isn&#039;t all that matters, as I&#039;ve found out: there&#039;s plenty of vendors with great feedback that are trashed here in the forums -- and jägermeister&#039;s input was really valuable in deciding.

				I&#039;ve tried several vendors in the EU. Here&#039;s what they&#039;re like (this is just about the speed. not considering service/price/packaging)<br /><br />Amsterdope (Netherlands): 10 grams Dutch Ampetamine/Speed. It was a lot stronger than expected! As a result I was fucked up for a very long time. I liked it a lot because it had a low bodyload but powerful effects on the brain. Smelled super strong and burned my nose up like a motherfucker. Was a little wet when it arrived.<br /><br />FrankMatthews (Netherlands): 5 grams Speed PASTE 60/65%. Had quite a heavy bodyload, reeked, very wet because it was speed paste, after all, it was strong and okay but not great like his heroin.<br /><br />Budworx UK (UK) 5 grams HIGH GRADE SPEED Ampetamine Pretty mild, had to do a lot to get the proper effects but when they came they were very pleasant. good for occasional users/low-tolerance<br /><br />Boymaster (Spain) 1g of Speed I&#039;m on it right now why do you think I&#039;m typing all this up??? Crap I oughtta be working right now. This speed is very high purity so keep doses small. Yes I&#039;m finding it very enjoyable. Upsides of high purity include: less nose damage, no burn, no/little drip, no smell, smaller packages (so less suspicious) and fewer chemicals doing who knows what to your body. Hooray!
