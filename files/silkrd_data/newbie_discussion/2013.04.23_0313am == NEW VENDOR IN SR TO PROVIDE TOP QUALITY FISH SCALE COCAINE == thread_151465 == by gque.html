				Okay, Im going to start this review off with&nbsp; 8) ;D :D haha as good as it was.<br /><br />So it is 10:28pm and I have had 6 drinks. I am a big guy as well I am 6&#039;4&quot; 230lbs. and it takes me about 10 drinks to feel really buzzed. <br />I got the sample earlier today (5 days to US) (Fast from canada). Been eyeballing it all day, however, saving it for this evening so I can write up a good review. <br /><br />It is now 11:15pm with a few more drinks down I am feeling very good and ready to sample GQUE&#039;s product!<br /><br />Oh. My. God. that was it! That moment when I did it, I knew why that this has always been &#039;my&#039; drug of choice. I began using it prior to performances as I am a guitar player turned DJ. &amp; I would mellow out the coke with a shot or two of Jack Daniel&#039;s before a set.<br /><br />Well this coke had a STRONG and I mean Strong smell however surprisingly was smooth going down.<br /><br />First of all, a couple things I know about good coke. One, It shouldn&#039;t burn on the drip. Just numb the shit out of your throat. It should smell like ether, to a point. Also, it should &quot;rock up&quot; or clump in humidity. It did ALL of the above. No burn, smooth, not incredibly speedy, however very numbing and euphoric as fishscale coke should. I think anyone can agree with me that has tried GQUE&#039;s product knows exactly what I am talking about. Tho, short the answers of the others sample &quot;obtainiees&quot; they still knew it was A+ shit, as it is.<br /><br />I also want to make a point about the &#039;euphoric&#039; state of the gque&#039;s product. It is the, I guess you would say, honest true form of quality cocaine. Me being in my profession, I have tried all different types of cocaine, including Nod&#039;s &quot;infamous&quot; cocaine. Sorry to say but this easily compares to his with half the price. Don&#039;t believe me? Try about a small order of gque&#039;s and let it prove itself.<br /><br />I probably got .1 to .15 of his coke and it is now 2am and I have still half of it left. This was based off a small line. AMAZING. Thank you gque!!!<br /><br />10/5 Vendor<br />6/5 Product<br />5/5 shipping time<br />5/5 communication<br />and another 5/5 for just a genuinely nice guy!<br /><br />Thanks again for a great evening thru the road!!!<br /><br />Long Live SR! and we all know based upon recent &#039;attacks&#039; we all can hope and pray SR will prevail!<br /><br />-RUSH<br />

				I am much appreciated to all great reviews, this has been an amazing run for me on the road. I have been on the road for less than a month, and i am trying my very best to climb my way up to the top. I have since been promoting my samples, waiting on feedback and reviews, and its finally paying off. I put full trust on my gear as my product speaks on its behalf , the quality is definitely top scale and it really changes other peoples thoughts about quality products. I am really happy that people are really liking my gear and that my product is being compared to other vendors, seems like competition is about to rise. I am definitely ready to encounter all ups and downs on my journey to provide the best service to all, I am not going to just continue doing what i am doing, but i will for sure improve my services as i grow on the road. Thanks to all support on the road<br /><br /><br />APPRECIATED GQUE

				Received my order from gque today, domestic shipping was very fast.&nbsp; Communication was excellent as well, gque was very cordial and prompt with replies.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done coke a few times in this life, pretty much all from different sources.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m just a recreational user but since joining SR I&#039;ve tried MIMMs HH coke as well, I would say it&#039;s at least on par with his high heat gear although I found MIMMs to be much more &quot;aromatic&quot; (ether smell?) than gque&#039;s.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s at all an indication of a superior product, just different products, the first bump smelled and tasted like what I expected from good coke, from both vendors.<br /><br />All in all, I&#039;m very happy with gque&#039;s product, seems slightly more speedy than MIMMs but definitely on par for quality and at a cheaper price.&nbsp; Stealth could use some improvement but this was a quick domestic shipment and I&#039;ve communicated my concerns with gque.&nbsp;
