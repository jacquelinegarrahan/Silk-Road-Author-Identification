				This is inspired by the excellent &quot;note from a postal worker&quot; thread (awesome first post, that guy&#039;s a champ)<br /><br />He said that a postal worker&#039;s usually only going to check a package if there&#039;s a strong (I guess skunk) smell coming from it. Do they pick up on any other clues? Eg I bought a bottle of restricted pharma pills recently from a local vendor. The gear was delivered to my door in a factory sealed bottle in a large plastic postage bag. Fucking pills rattled like hell! The several postal workers who would&#039;ve handled the package over the course of its delivery would surely have been able to figure out what was inside due to the sound of the pills rattling around and the shape of the bottle inside the package - pretty clear to anyone with half a brain it&#039;s a bottle of pills. Wouldn&#039;t this be the kind of thing that would arouse suspicion? Sure they don&#039;t know what kind of pills they are but pretty weird to be mailing a bottle of pills to someone...

				Your postal workers are obviously less curious and more honest than me.&nbsp; ;D

				You&#039;d probably be surprised, after all look how many pharmacists have websites now. Bottles of pills aren&#039;t that rare. I think country of origin and quality of packaging probably matter the most. If you got a pill bottle from some dodgy part of Asia with a hand written address and it held together with string it&#039;s probably going to raise flags.
