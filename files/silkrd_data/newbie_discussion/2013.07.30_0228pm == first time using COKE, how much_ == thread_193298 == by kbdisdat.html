				Coke is a neverending hole in your pocket. If you want the best out of it don&#039;t do it you just will never be satisfied because you will always want more immediatly. I&#039;d recomenddoing 2 quick 50mg bumbs really quick to get a good high but really you will be down again in an hour. I&#039;d recomend meph if you want the coke feel and it gives more euphoria

				It&#039;s for my birthday so I want to have a good time.<br /><br />I dunno about meth. Seems abit strong for someone whos hardest drug tried thus far is MDMA.<br /><br />Speed is meth right? In powder form?<br /><br />How long would a bump of speed last anyway? Might consider it to be honest.

				Meph is mephedrone sory didn&#039;t specify. Its described as a coke and mdma mix. And its prety awsome. You are on edge like coke and like almost rolling on mdma it feels really good actually<br /><br />But I mean happy birthday and have fun!<br /><br />&nbsp;And no meth is methamphetamates. And speed is amphetamine I think dont quote me but there is a difference. Im not to into stimulants. speed is pretty much really strong add meds when I do it. Feels like I took adderal also pointless in my opinion that&#039;s why&nbsp; speed is not as common now a days because there is stuff with more euphoria.<br /><br />Speed is really good with mdma tho as long as you find the ratio. I like 100mg mdma for every 10mg speed. It will make you just want to dance till you fall over lol!

				Sounds fun.<br /><br />I&#039;m rolling the week before my birthday, so unless meph doesn&#039;t release shit loads of serotonin like MDMA, i&#039;d probably be up for trying it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t wanna cook my brain two weeks in a row, haha.<br /><br />What other drugs are fun for special occasions?

				I think SR is probably the best place to get coke, especially for the first time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Because when you are out, you are out.&nbsp; No calling dealers to wake up at 7 or 8 am...

				I&#039;d do a line about an inch long and quart inch wide.&nbsp; (2.5cm x .5cm)<br /><br />If you&#039;ve never done it before, start small.&nbsp; If you wanna do more, do more.&nbsp; <br /><br />Coke on SR is much, much better than you can get any where on the street in most places.

Its always cool to try different ones. But I&#039;m still in love with my psychedelics compared to others. <br /><br />About once a month me and a bunch of my friends anywhere from 4-15 or so people try to decide which psychedelic we are going todo. 2cb is absolutly amazing with a bunch of people. The only problwm with that is I normally get powder from nawlins and have to weigh it out on a precise scale which i have but for 12 people sucks. We normally just pick 25i or mushies <br /><br />
