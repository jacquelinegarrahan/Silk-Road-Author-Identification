				Title: <strong>Standardized rating system ?</strong><br />

				Hi !<br /><br />I always wondered why buyers reviews seemed so incomplete or useless. While I don&#039;t pretend i got a better idea than the current system (which is not used as intended), I do think some people would like to provide a better feedback on their order. <br /><br />In order to do so, I was thinking of a standardized format published over the forum until a better system is implemented. This would be of course an unofficial tool provided as it is to SR users.<br />But before that, the purpose of this topic is actually to discuss such a rating system.<br /><br />What should we rate and how ? How can we display our rating in a compact and standardized format ?<br /><br />I think such a rating system should be :<br /><br />- Easy to memorize and read.<br />- As neutral as possible.<br />- Only rating what&#039;s essential.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s CRUCIAL to rate the packaging too. And reviewing such aspect must be done very carefully since we don&#039;t want to give too much details about it. That&#039;s why i think a &quot;numbered&quot; grade (I.E. X/5 or X/10) is perfect for this. It gives a hint about the stealthiness of the package while keeping specific details confidential.<br /><br />Also i really don&#039;t get why products are usually not really reviewed... Even if a review is subjective and highly inaccurate, that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s worthless.<br /><br />The best option would be in my humble opinion, a compact standardized format that can easily be added at the end of your review:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">(V-/S-/P-)</code><br />V -&gt; Vendor rated out of 10 (Responsiveness, professionalism, reliability)<br />S -&gt; Stealthiness rated out of 10. How stealth was the package in your opinion ? 10 being an allegedly undetectable package and 0 being a package with &quot;I CONTAIN ILLEGAL STUFF&quot; written on it.<br />P -&gt; Product quality as advertised out of 10. I know this is hard to rate. A good way to do so would be to grade how close the vendor was to what was advertised. If a product is advertised as low quality and is just like that, then it&#039;s cool and a bad grade would be bad for everyone. <br /><br />Example :<br /><br />(V-9/S-7/P-9)<br />Very good vendor ... Quite stealth Package ... Quality as described.<br /><br />What do you guys think about that ?
