				Can you not browse the information in the other sections?<br />I don&#039;t see how you are doing more than you would usually, though many of you are going about this in a really labor driven manner that is unneeded.<br />You can either ask your question here or search the forum for topics on your question that will provide answers and if you cant find the answers come ask here again.<br />I promise if you guys ask questions instead of spamming up posts count you&#039;ll get much more direct answers to your questions from moderators than you might in the open forum because this section is much smaller and easier to manage and get to everyone&#039;s questions.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				The fears might be overblown, but then they might not be.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a good idea to think twice before you post anything on here. Threads like what music do you listen to whilst on XTC? seem pretty innocent but post in a thousand threads like that and LE can build up a pretty good profile of you.<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s pretty unlikely for most of us that LE will ever end up investigating us in that much detail, but what if they do?<br /><br />Anyway, the worst part about the newbie forum is that is is full of newbies who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing giving advice to other newbies who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing. There is a guy on the main forum posting links to clearnet websites telling people to access them outside of TOR..... !? The worst part is, I think he actually believes that is the correct thing to do. Then again, he might be LE? Who knows. But post stuff like that in this forum and there won&#039;t necessarily be people to come along and correct it...

				The thread is more about what you post on this forum though.<br /><br />If I post my name and address here, LE will probably be able to track me down... whether I&#039;m using TOR or not!<br /><br />If I post my home town, the school I went to, and what I do for a living, LE may well be able to track me down...<br /><br />If I post my country, favourite music, favourite drugs, whether I received a package today or not, etc.... can LE track me down? Probably not. But the longer that list gets, and more likely it is my clearnet activity will correlate with all the info about me........ who knows?

				When I said LE can&#039;t find you thru TOR is very true.&nbsp; Because how much will the gov pay for a computer person maybe 80 or so.&nbsp; When I said other people can if they wanted to, because a criminal interprise that recruits only&nbsp; the best.&nbsp; Money is no object so if they really wanted to find you they would be payed lots of cash.&nbsp; It would not that easy but if they wanted they fuckin could, but only if it was fuckin neccesary, now do you understand my fuckin point of&nbsp; view

				Actually, not to get too noided out here, but small details about personal tastes are clues to identity. Things like that also establish behavior patterns which can lead to uncovering someones identity. These are the things that the fed monsters use to track anons. Just don&#039;t offer up any specifics about your own habits, and don&#039;t use any nicks, sigs, or related digital tidbits that draw parallels to your actual identity. Chaos is your friend! ;D

				Yes, until an investigation goes public, every possible technique is a statistical possibility. It could be a paradigm shift as to how LE and the public responds to SR. If it becomes a public safety issue, then it could spell serious trouble ahead. There are responsible men and women on the forum that have taken public safety seriously. SR allows entrepreneurs to develop credible business relations via an anonymous marketplace. Granted that it is &quot;illegal&quot;, I believe that SR will be more easily accepted as a permanent facet of society than street corner thugs and gangsters. <br /><br />Drugs can now be bought/sold with discretion and relative safety--with the exception of the rampant number of synthetic drugs, especially in the THC market which dominates the Road. This is an incredible change to how the Drug War of the Nixon Era will operate. Roughly, 40 years of changes, and we can finally move away from the violent War on Drugs to a more European model of tolerance and legalization. This new model, if it is adopted, will at least remove the stigma and hardship of using drugs so that people that want to break uncontrollable habits (meth, coke, heroin, i.e. hard drugs), will have the resources to get clean. A USPS rate increase could dramatically shape public health and safety, instead of violent capture methods by SWAT storm troopers and CIA-like plain clothes detectives... <br /><br />hopefully... hopefully there will be enough honest LEOs with hearts and minds, open and more intelligent than a foot soldier awaiting orders. Cops don&#039;t want to be shot at. They want to finish the day with their wife and kids. Who doesn&#039;t wanna go home and fuck their partner senseless at the end of the day? Or maybe just some spray some knucklechildren all over their favorite magazine--or nowadays, their keyboard. Fuck more, fight less.

I maintain that there is no way that LE will track you down because of what you write here - the resources required could never be marshaled to apply to an individual user. It&#039;s conceivable that LE could get to what I write here AFTER they&#039;ve already tracked me down (due to whatever fuck-up which we all need to realize is not 100% guaranteed not to happen), but I&#039;m probably already fucked by that time, and if I&#039;m smart I&#039;ll take the steps needed to keep my SR presence out of LE sight if they do happen to bust down my door one morning.&nbsp; As a matter of principle and good practices, I&#039;m not going to give out all kinds of identifying information, but I&#039;m not going to be all paranoid and worry about totally sanitizing every sentence.&nbsp; If I was one of the major vendors, I&#039;d have a different attitude and be more serious about making sure I didn&#039;t say anything that wasn&#039;t necessary for carrying on business.<br />
