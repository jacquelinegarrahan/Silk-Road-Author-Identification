				anyone else agree? That rush feeling you get when ordering from SR, the agonizing pain of waiting, and then the joyous moment when you open your mailbox to see a very stealthy package with your name on it? Because I&#039;m still pretty new to the site I always think to myself wtf are you serious it actually worked!? Then running back inside and doing all my drugs in 5minutes so i can start the process all over again haha!<br />thanks SR, the process of ordering and receiving is ALMOST as good as doing the drugs&nbsp; ;D

				Oh yeah! Only made one purchase but remember waiting for the bitcoin transfer to hit my SR Wallet thinking something is gonna go wrong as took a few hours.<br /><br />Had quite a sabbatical from the drug I ordered as locally it went dry.&nbsp; When that envelope came couldnt describe the happiness!!&nbsp; What was meant for the weekend disappeared Wednesday night!

				I know that feeling. Its a rush when you click the button to place the order then the wait. Its like christmas morning when you open your mailbox and see that plain piece of mail that would never stick out if you didn&#039;t already know&nbsp; what was in it.

				so true i was extremely worried when i transferred my bitcoins for the first time. I think i did like 1 dollar the first transaction then when i saw it did the whole thing...such a scary moment though especially after jumping through all the hoops to turn money into bitcoins! <br /><br />i remember my first piece of mail i was thinking wait are you serious there&#039;s really shit in that? So well packaged took me about 10 minutes just to unpack my gear haha! definitely some creative vendors here and I&#039;m certainly thankful for them!

				I just spend 20 minutes looking through perfectly innocent fucking mail.<br /><br />...<br />...<br />...<br /><br />I found my LSD, though. And it Ehrlich tested positive!<br /><br />So yeah, there is definitely a high. It&#039;s pretty awesome living in the future, ordering drugs on the internet and being able to intentionally not deal with, well, dealers.

				I&#039;m not sure which is worse, waiting for a package to arrive or not having a package in transit.<br /><br />The high isn&#039;t a good thing though.&nbsp; Ideally I&#039;d leave things in the mailbox for a day or more, not rip the packages open ASAP when I get them, etc.

				True.<br /><br />But anybody ever got the reverse feelings of just KNOWING your package Is In there, but when you open your mailbox/p.o. box It&#039;s completely empty?<br /><br />That feeling generally sends me Into a deep depression for the rest of the day :(

				I used to spend forever and a day scouring the silk road for the best deals, and it always paid off greatly. I always had the right substances for the right events. <br /><br />Now I have access to an employee discount. I smoke on the cheap! There is definitely a thrill when I open up such a big package at such a little dent to my wallet.
