				Tessellated has hands down the best acid me or my friends have ever tried. When it says 200ug I didn&#039;t quite believe him until I tried it for myself. I took 2 tabs. EVERYTHING was moving like crazy. I saw pathways of colors connecting me and my friends. I&#039;m not even sure if they were open or closed eye visuals. I could not stop laughing the entire time. My eyes kept watering because of it. <br /><br />At one point I had such long tracers that I said, &quot;it&#039;s like a windows 95 freezing up!&quot;. The tracers filled up my &quot;screen&quot; or line of vision to where I couldn&#039;t see straight. So yeah, i had really strong visuals.<br /><br />my friends screamed, &quot;when will the peak end!!&quot; about 4 hours after taking the acid. We all peaked for a very long time and the comedown was very very slow and gradual. <br /><br />I took molly about 7 hours after dropping the tabs. At this point I was still tripping balls, but the molly sent my trip into a nice direction. <br /><br />Fastforward to 15 hours after taking the tabs and I was still tripping pretty hard. I still saw objects breathing. This worried me because I had to drive back home shortly. It felt as if the trip would never end. However, once I finally got some sleep the trip ended, and I felt back to normal!<br /><br />Great acid and hope to get more soon

				Swell man. Is this your first foray into S.R. acid? Or have you had other vendors&#039;?

				Im interested in getting some acid. But have never experimented with anything other then weed and maybe a few pills. Would you recommend 200ug tabs for a first time trip? Or should I try mushrooms first like everyone keeps telling me

Personally I recommend LSD, as it will be easier to control your dose. If you have ~200µg tabs, for example, you can easily just cut the paper to take a smaller hit. For your first time, I recommend you stay at or under 150µg, possibly even under 100. This will get your mind&#039;s feet wet, help you acclimate to the weirdness of tripping, and will probably get you really excited to trip balls later. Make sure to wait a couple weeks between your mini-dose and your first big trip, otherwise you&#039;re just wasting good acid.
