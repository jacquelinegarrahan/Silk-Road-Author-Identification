				I have experience with DMT.&nbsp; Definitely had some phosphene visuals going on with that.&nbsp; My GF has done salvia. She says it&#039;s very unpleasant.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve tended to stay away from it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like disassociation, or anything like that,&nbsp; but I&#039;ll check out that 2ct-2 stuff.&nbsp; Never even heard it.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;

				OK,&nbsp; yeah I&#039;ve been scoping out the 2C family quite a bit.&nbsp; Honestly I&#039;m not very familiar with it.&nbsp; Definitely gotta try it now.&nbsp; I saw a trip report where somebody took 2C-B and 4-Aco-DMT, and it seemed pretty amazing.&nbsp; Thanks for the recommendation!

				2cb is a good start, to phenethylamines as is 2ci.&nbsp; 2ce gets more intense and introspective with almost a spiritual aspect its a defiantly good, but not for people who haven&#039;t had much experience in mho.&nbsp;

				Take a larger dose of DMT. Hands down the most visual drug. Also, try smoking it at the peak of an acid or shroom trip for an intense experience. Or, take an MAOI like Syrian Rue an hour before smoking DMT and it will last much longer. Don&#039;t fuck with salvia, that shit sucks (although definitely heavy visuals.

				I think people expect some experience of pink elephants dancing around a fire or something. I never see things like this, just see stuff out of the corner of my eye or tracers or confuse things, or see high detail. If I actually got some serious hallucinations like that, I would probably not be okay with that haha.

				2cb, 2ce, lsd, shroom, and dmt have been experienced. it&#039;s hard to separate what&#039;s most visual. visual in what sense? sight? sound? balance? greatest change in object or most flow of textures? <br /><br />regardless, it&#039;s all individual. so your question falls deep into a fallacious pit from the beginning.

				OK,&nbsp; yeah.&nbsp; didn&#039;t mean to take you down a fallacious pit like that.&nbsp; :/&nbsp; Guess I just mean visual, like fractals and what not.&nbsp; Less body high if you know what I mean.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking like yellow submarine visuals.&nbsp; Waves of vivid colors and visions.

				You guys who are saying DMT are close, as it&#039;s a clear second I think, but a big bowl of 40x Salvia with a high heat torch or lighter<br />is BY FAR the most intense experience. It is truly a difference universe, like a K-Hole but 10x more bizarre. However, your mind is totally lost too.<br /><br />For a strong one where you&#039;ll probably remember everything I&#039;d say 20-40mg of 2CB is your best bet. SNORTED, not swallowed. Just prepare for 10minutes of agony first!

				Honestly a strong solid LSD dose gives amazing visuals.&nbsp; 2c&#039;s are great too. DMT is next level--very spiritual.<br /><br />Leave salvia alone.&nbsp; That&#039;s a dark place and is anything but fun.

				I totally agree, Salvia is a dark dark place and can send you temporarily mad. But it is literally the answer to the question posed.<br /><br />Personally a powerful K-Hole is my fave, a 300-500mg line and an episode of South Park.<br /><br />Strong LSD or good quality 2CB are nice in that they aren&#039;t too overpowering (as in you still have most of your wits about you).<br /><br />DMT is more like Salvia in that it really is an altered state of mind and perception. It&#039;s the most horrible to smoke though. Tastes<br />like a chemical arms factory in your lungs and mouth.<br /><br />Mushrooms can go wrong so easily that you have to be careful leading into the harder end, some people have really bad trips (like anything I guess) on mushrooms that put them&nbsp; off psychedelics for life. I love some great mushrooms if you put em in a shake (so horrible to chew (AND YOU HAVE TO CHEW, SUCH A COMMON MISTAKE) but like anything I guess, be careful!<br /><br />If you can get it, drink some reindeer piss!
