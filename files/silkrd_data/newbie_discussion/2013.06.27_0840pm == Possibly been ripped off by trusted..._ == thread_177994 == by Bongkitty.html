				I think I&#039;ve been victim of a trusted vendor I&#039;ve worked with for many moons now, simply running with my money.... O.o<br />I still haven&#039;t got any solid proof, however every time I try to contact on tor chat, they delete me as a contact and ignore messages... Also, they haven&#039;t responded to messages on the road in a couple days, and it&#039;s been almost an entire MONTH since funds were released to this person, and I&#039;m still waiting to see if they even show up on point... What can I do?

				Never...ever....F.E.<br />But now since it&#039;s all said and done it couldn&#039;t hurt to tell us the vendors name. Did you order domestically or...?

				Never FE....I mean how many times have you read that here??&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry for your shitty deal, but we&#039;re dealing with drug dealers here, not upstanding citizens.&nbsp; There&#039;s no real honor anymore, not on SR, not in RL, nowhere.<br /><br />If it&#039;s been that long...pull their card...let us all know who it is so one of us doesn&#039;t get taken by the pos.&nbsp; At the least, call em&#039; out and see if they reply to the accusations on your thread.&nbsp; Good luck man.

				I&#039;ve been working with this vendor for months, and until I am POSITIVE that I&#039;ve been scammed I will not say word of his name, so as to no cast a shadow of unnecessary doubt upon his name. I&#039;ve been going through him since I was to say early april, maybe late march. ALWAYS came through previously, due to my situation we&#039;ve always worked out of escrow, we had a significant level of trust developed, to the point when my last order came through, I had to leave town for a couple weeks, and I left him with 500 USD. I return from business, and he has yet to send the order, claims to have sent monday, (normaly arrives within 2/3 days due to geography),&nbsp; says it should be there wednesday NO PROBLEMS. Wednesday comes, he deletes contact from torchat, and ignore all my messages on the road... At this point I still have some faith, since why would anyone cut and run on such a small amount perceptually... For now I&#039;m biding my time, I refuse to slander not only his name, but my own as well over stupid paranoia which is OVERLY abundant in this part of the universe. In my experience, I have seen MANY vendors slack in some way for just a moment, and then come through in the end. Leaving the customer to look dumb as fuck, or like a straight up liar. Either way I&#039;m down to give it a week, before I even consider mentioning his name. All I WILL say, is dude is grade AAA, and comes through like magic. However these things are worthless it if they don&#039;t actually arrive :/

				Well if he&#039;s ignoring you and he went out of his way to delete you off of torchat then it does indeed sound like you&#039;ve gotten scammed. I mean, it&#039;s no problem giving it a week or so just to wait it out, no customer wants to look like the impatient boob lol. But people can do anything over the net, it&#039;s not unheard of that a reputable vendor decides to tell everyone to fuck off take the money and run.

				Indeed indeed, quite a shame if this is indeed the route he took, however only time will tell, and while my words in particular may have little to no effect, if I&#039;m given enough reason to believe he did just that, I&#039;ll do my best to make sure his deeds are known on both of his review threads.... But I&#039;m SINCERELY hoping that won&#039;t be necessary, since his BK was straight up out of this world, as was pretty much anything else I ever received from him....

				Sounds like you got scammed. You don&#039;t need to wait that long to call him out. Just my 2 cents. good luck!
