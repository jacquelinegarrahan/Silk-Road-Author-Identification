				Hello, I am interested in buying some fake credit cards. Hopefully someone will clarify something with me. The ones that I have found on the site I think are saying that I need to deposit money into the cards and then I can use it anywhere? How can I get a card in a fake name with credit on it, use it online and then burn it.

				those are for anonymous loading and then you can spend it without it being traced to you, they are prepaid debit cards not ones that come with money on them, I could have one send to free dont pay for it.. what you want is one that has money on it and you get he card numbers , names expires etc etc that have loot to spend on it right? the ones your talking of have zero money and they are like the pre=paid visas you buy at the gas station, but this way they do not have you on cam, pretty much stupid waste of money if you sk me,, i got two in my name today thing is they need a real SS number to get it to you so these peeps are making pre-paids with other people information so that you can load and spend without having purchases tracked bck to you, hope this helps ya brother<br /><br />K

				So you&#039;re looking for an anonymous credit card that you can use on line? If you&#039;re in the United States or Canada, you can purchase fixed amount credit cards from any gas station, grocery store, etc. (wear a hoodie, pay with cash - that&#039;s important) and then use them anywhere they accept master card/visa. They probably sell them in other countries, but I&#039;m not 100% sure. <br /><br />You could also just buy stolen credit card #&#039;s and use that (obviously don&#039;t get anything shipped to your real address).<br /><br />Hope this helps :)

				Yeah, I want a Credit Card, that has money on Credit. Use it to buy online currency and then trasfer the online currency into a paypal account. I dont want one that I have to load money onto unless I can say load $5 onto and overdraw it for hundreds or thousands. Can I buy those credit cards here? Or can I overdraw these other cards?

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be able to find a credit card that you can over draw without registering your personal information. When I started carding the HackBB wiki and forums were a phenomenal resource (wiki: clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page | forums: http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/).<br /><br />I also suggest you avoid PayPal all together as your account will get &quot;limited&quot; very quickly.

				So I would have to get a fake name and ID and sign up for one with that name? Or do I need a stolen real ID. How could I get the money into my account from the virtual currency without it tracing to me?
