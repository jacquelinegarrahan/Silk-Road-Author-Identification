				Im sorry mate, I don&#039;t guess I understand your question. I have never sent BTC out of my SR wallet unless it was to another SR address. I can however say that deposits can be made from any working BTC address outside of SR, for instance MTGOX &amp; Bitfloor.

				You can receive bitcoins into your SR wallet from any other wallet .... likewise, you can send bitcoins out of your SR wallet and INTO any other wallet as well.

				I face the same issue in terms of the sending/receiving address when I cash out.<br />To solve it, I personally use the BlockChain.info online wallet. Transfer from SR to BlockChain and from there, the send address is the same as the receive address. <br />:)

SR should send out from a new address from their mixer (this is a good thing for anonymity, but bad for you in this case). You may be able to message support, tell them the address and transaction number and try to convince them that those incoming coins are supposed to be yours (explain the betting situation), and maybe you&#039;ll get them credited to your account. Hopefully sending addresses are not deleted by SR after use, but they may be. Good luck, I hope I&#039;m wrong!
