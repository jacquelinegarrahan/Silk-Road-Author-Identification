				I just tried to do PGP code for two different vendors, one I was able to decode and put my info in easily and order but for some reason with southern humboldts pgp key on his main profile page <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to call you out SouthernHumboldt I just assume posting here will get a response from someone faster who may of had this issue or maybe I&#039;m doing something wrong but I did the other PGP the same way and it worked perfectly.

				Sorry to bump this but I still can solve other vendors pgp key easily with an online website that encypts and decodes but with this specific PGP key it doesnt work? Is anybody having luck trying to decode this pgp key?

				You shouldn&#039;t be using websites for PGP anyways.&nbsp; That is very insecure.

				Well all the guides on pgp I have read seem very confusing and focus more on encrypting your own messages and sending them so there set to where me(the user) can give my pgp code to other people and I am trying to do the opposite. Is there any really simple guides that work with pgp keychain?
