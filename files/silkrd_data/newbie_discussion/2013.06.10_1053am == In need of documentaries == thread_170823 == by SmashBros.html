				Hey dude, just coz no ones replied Ill point you in the right direction. <br />Best journalist-visiting-gang docos are done by Ross Kemp and Louis Theroux. Look them up. Both have long series and always go to the craziest places. <br /><br />This was 50% to get to 50 posts and 50% to help you out coz no one else has. Hope that gives you some entertainment man.

				These aren&#039;t torrents but Youtube has some great docu&#039;s on just about whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />This is a good BBC one, The Truth About Smoking Cannabis http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Z-ApiwgY0<br /><br />And another from CNBC http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHKGJfhsFa0<br /><br />If you are looking for torrents specifically I recommend IPTorrents.com

				OK Smashbros, this is what you need: Introducing Stream Transport!<br /><br />http://www.streamtransport.com/<br /><br />Once you download the software, open it up, copy/paste the Youtube URL and it will download instantly. You can use VLC player to watch the downloads or you can convert the video file to something you prefer.<br /><br />Another advantage with Stream Transport is that it will rip any video from a web page, so you can fill your boots at DailyMotion, Meta Cafe etc.<br /><br />Hope you find it helpful!&nbsp; :D

				As i was making a reply to your request (delivering a list of documentaries), i realized that this would be one hell of a long post, so i decided thatit would be much better if i created a new topic.<br /><br />But if you are looking for some interesting documentaries (They are all about drugs, one way or another), i encourage you to take a glance at this thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172947.0<br /><br />
