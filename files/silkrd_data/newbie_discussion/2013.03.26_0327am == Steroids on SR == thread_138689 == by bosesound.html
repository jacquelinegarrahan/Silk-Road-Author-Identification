				I wanted to post on some anabolic steroids I purchased from BigBuff. Pretty sure this stuff is not legit. I&#039;ve taken testosterone before, and my balls shrink. This stuff, nothing. I&#039;m going to get blood levels of testosterone tested ASAP, but I&#039;m annoyed about this. If in fact my levels are super human (as they should be while taking exogenous Testosterone), then I owe him an apology, but I think I need some proof, because as of now I&#039;m very skeptical.

				Ya, I did a cycle with some gear I got IRL from a trusted source about 6 months ago. Shit was strong enough to make my balls suck into my stomach at before I blew a load, at around week 3.&nbsp; My sex drive was crazy too, so I&#039;m familiar with what is expected. I&#039;m getting a Testosterone draw next week to see if this is legit. I&#039;ll update everyone after I get the results.<br /><br />Anyone know about hypniticstatez gear?

				I&#039;m certainly not the only one to feel his stuff is weak. I was looking for other people&#039;s opinion. I will vouch for his product when I get the results back, and eat crow for sure if I have to. I wanted people to hold off on any purchases because after 5 weeks of running 500mg/week I should have some very noticeable effects, side effects at least. So you&#039;ve used his stuff and got huge, great. What is your dosage? Was Enanthate&nbsp; spelled wrong on your bottles too? No real feedback from his customer&#039;s count, as they seem to be unaware that you can release funds without commenting, so people are only commenting that they received this oil. We&#039;ll wait on the results, and I will certainly apologize if I have to. I hope I&#039;m wrong. <br /><br />And suddenly there is feedback on his page saying that someone had their testosterone levels tested and it was legit? What great timing!

				Buying pre made steroid is such a waste of money. I decided to start importing all my raws from China. Some get through, some don&#039;t. A 10ml bottle of Test Enth cots about $8 to make. Compare that to what you are paying now.

Run something like enanthate or cypionate. Workout regularly and diet right, you will put on size/strength pretty quickly. If your test levels are low, you may want to stay on at least a therapeutic dose. I&#039;ve been using/selling steroids for many years. If you have questions, fell free to ask.

It is an oral steroid so you wont need needles and alcohol swabs, but unlike other oral steroids it is known to be much more gentle on your liver. Doctors prescribe it to HIV patients to prevent wasting, and in the bodybuilding community it is felt to have such few side effects that women can take small doses without any problems. It won&#039;t make you huge, but you will gain a couple pounds of muscle in a few months even if you don&#039;t work out. You won&#039;t get all bloated with water, and you won&#039;t get gynecomastia. I recommend you investigate it for yourself, but I think that would be a good steroid to start with.

				Also, the vendor Jakeyblues1987 sells anavar, and although I haven&#039;t tried his anavar, I did try is dbol a few months ago. I don&#039;t have much experience with oral steroids, but within 3 weeks my bench went up about 40% and my friends and family were commenting on how good I looked. I would say that the dbol he had was good, but it&#039;s my only dbol experience. I would buy them again though, as it was a fun 4 weeks. Because the Test E I got was crap, I ended up doing a dbol only cycle, which was hell on my HPA.

				Anyone who has used Testosterone E before knows that it can take up to 6-8 weeks to take effect and have noticeable results. Look it up in steroid forums. I welcome you to test the product at a lab or have your blood level tested after 6 weeks. To this date, I dont have one bad feedback on steroid sales over 3000 vials sold on SR and my repeat business is through the roof. Check out the large number of feedback on my products. No other steroid seller sales more or has the sane feedback. <br /><br />If you have tested and its garbage I will give you a full refund and anything else you would like to make ammends. <br /><br />So please before talking shit about me, please know for sure. <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Buff

				FAKE, FAKE, FAKE. Good reviews don&#039;t turn oil into Testosterone. I got my blood work back, and after 7 weeks of bigbuff&#039;s Test E the conclusion is that my test levels are at a normal level for a man of my age and health. They are 10x lower than what would be expected from 7 weeks of 500mg/week of test E. They should be above 1000, as the test is specific for testosterone, whether natural or injected. Stay away from his Test E, it is oil. If anyone has any questions please feel free to PM me. Many people have written me with similar concerns, this guys is scamming people.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll make a new account, and order some gear from Bigbuff, and pay, just to leave some real feedback to warm people away from this. I&#039;ve have MANY transactions here. and this is the first time I have been scammed. I have no ulterior motive, other than to warn people about not wasting their hard earned money, and their TIME!! Why not just rob from people on the street? This is very upsetting, and anyone that feels scammed should speak up. If there is any question whether your gear is real, then it is FAKE. Testosterone results are DRAMATIC, and you will know after a few weeks.<br /><br />I recommend you respond to my messages, or I will continue to spread the word, and get SR involved. What reason could someone have to sell oil? It is illegal for the feds to sell drugs, but sending oil is a sweet honeypot for addresses and names of people looking to buy steroids, am I right?
