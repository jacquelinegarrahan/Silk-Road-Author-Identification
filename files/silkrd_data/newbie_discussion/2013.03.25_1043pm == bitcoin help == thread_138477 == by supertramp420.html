				I don&#039;t use the SR vendors anymore, some are good, but the bunch that suck, like Googleye and BitcoinBillionaires, will deter you from wanting to go back for another experience.<br />&nbsp;Here is how I do it:<br />&nbsp;New Cell phone, the beginning of establishing an anonymous ID, a no contract phone. Establish the phone account in the name and address that you will be using for the transactions. An alias, not your real name or address<br />&nbsp;Use Tor or Anonymox to establish a new email address, your IP is recorded when you sign in so you want to hide behind a proxy every time you use the email.<br />&nbsp;Go to Blockchain, and get behind a proxy, then establish an anonymous account there. At Blockchain.com you can buy Bitcoins through Bitinstant.<br />&nbsp;I use Bitinstant now, I pay for the coins by means of bill pay with MoneyGram, using the Alias I created, and the coins are in my account at blockchain before I get home. <br />&nbsp;For extra security you can send the coins to a second wallet, then off to SR or BMR or wherever.&nbsp; That easy, no waiting for coin.<br />&nbsp;It takes some time for the coin to appear in your account here, about 2 hours, but they will show up.<br />&nbsp;The entire Bitcoin purchase is done using an alias, I just made up,&nbsp; so it is pretty much anonymous.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;I have&nbsp; a second SR account that I use just to receive the money in, I do nothing illegal with this account, maybe buy a ebook or something, and I send my bitcoin directly from Blockchain to my clean account. From there I send the coin to the account I use for making purchases with. After I receive the coins I just change the Bitcoin Wallet address, then send the coins to my other account to spend them.

				Going this route is cheaper, easier and faster than buying coin on the Road.

				instead of making a new thread can you explain the money orders as far as what you say or do when you get to a cvs or another authorized place?<br /><br />Also on the money order do you put the encrypted address on the sheet or is it something different when you have to print out the confirmation&gt;?<br /><br />Thanks
