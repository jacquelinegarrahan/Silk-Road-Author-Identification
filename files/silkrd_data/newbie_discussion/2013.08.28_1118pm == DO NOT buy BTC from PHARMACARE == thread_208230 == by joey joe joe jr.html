				As some of you may know, Pharmacare started selling international quality products domestically months back before he disappeared. I ordered some, and wanted to get more. His feedback is perfect, and my most hated part about the road is obtaining BTC, so I inquired about buying some. Over several messages he was very friendly and helpful. He explained how to do it all with a greendot pack. I do it, send him the code, and nothing. hours go by. he went from responding to all my messages very promptly, to not at all. I should have canceled the card that day, but i was giving the benefit of the doubt. Next day I wake up and he closed up shop. He was no longer selling anything anymore on sr, and that was the last time he signed in. I called up greendot, and they said yea the money was got, around 30 minutes after i sent him the message with the code. <br />I wasnt sure what to do since it was not a recorded SR transaction, i didn&#039;t know how to post in this forum, and he had closed up shop. <br />Well, 20 days ago he sends me a message to his opium listing. i hardly ever come on SR anymore since that last ripoff, but i did a few days ago. At first, i was kind of excited, because he is back, maybe he will be a stand up guy and make things right. I messaged him 2 times since with no reply, and he has updated his thread since, and SR says he has been on today. I&#039;ve once again come to the conclusion i will not get the btc at this point, but if i can prevent this from happening to anybody else, it is well worth it. <br />BE FOREWARNED!!!! I would stick to only escrowed transactions with him, never ever finalize early, and would NOT risk getting BTC from him.<br /><br />also, if anyone can shed light onto how i can become a full member and post this in his feedback and BTC threads, that would be great<br /><br />this is his btc thread on here<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195341.msg1478935#msg1478935

				I exchange BTC when I have some in stock if you are looking for someone honest, although I have a hard time keeping BTC in stock. Hopefully someday my USD cash out listing will see some business and I will be able to keep this project working on both sides, but for now keep an eye out for my listings.

				I just wanna jump in and give a recommendation for localbitcoins.&nbsp; Tor friendly site, and it lets you trade with people all over the place, with pretty much any method.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got their own escrow system, and they take no fees, so the price listed is the price you get.&nbsp; The only fees you&#039;ll incur are via your trade method (moneypak, moneygram, western union, etc).&nbsp; Lots of great BTC brokers there that are worth checking out.&nbsp; As great as SR is, it&#039;s not the best place to trade cash for coin.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not really set up for that.

				Damn... thanks for the warning! I opted for Coinbase instant, but obviously that requires not having the luxury of anonymity. I actually considered going the Moneypak route a couple months ago and I&#039;m very glad I decided against it.&nbsp; :-\ I definitely second the recommendation for localbitcoins though. Good luck next time, man.. <br /><br />Thanks again for the heads up.

I can&#039;t understand why people are willing to buy BTC from random vendors they find on SR forums, without any escrow or rating system. Localbitcoins is IT! Buy with confidence, with cash, any payment service you can name, anonymously, at lightning speed and some of the lowest prices anywhere. What&#039;s not to like??

				While there is no way on SR to do escrow when buying Bitcoin, there is a rating system. All my customers are required to buy a free listing and it serves as some protection for them as they can leave me less than perfect feedback if I do not deliver as promised. Localbitcoins sounds like a great service. Mine is here and it is also great.
