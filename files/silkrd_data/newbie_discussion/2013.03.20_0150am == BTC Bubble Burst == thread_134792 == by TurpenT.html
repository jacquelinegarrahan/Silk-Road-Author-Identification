				yea, it wouldn&#039;t be good. It would actually be awful.I would be among the many losing money :-\<br /><br />Luckily, the very opposite could in this instance. Our BTC&#039;s could be gaining value right now (or losing value in opposite conditions).<br /><br />I&#039;m just bored and playing over here since the main site&#039;s down. I guess this gives us more time to watch our BTC&#039;s value go up up up (knock knock)

				From what I have read and from what I understand, there seems to be many people who have invested into BTC.&nbsp; They will most likely cash out sooner than later.&nbsp; When this happens, BTC cost will drop significantly.

				With the considerable turmoil in Europe and Brussels hell bent on levying a tax on Cypriot CD&#039;s, BTC&#039;s value will hit 100.The currency&#039;s anonymity could solve the problem of&nbsp; banking&#039;s strangulation of the business transaction market. The inability to tax BTC also helps to counter the significant austerity measures which have been imposed.

So when something like a site outage happens, the Vendor isn&#039;t affected by whatever happens in the BTC climate during that time. The order has already been paid for and the BTC&#039;s or $$ doesn&#039;t change once the order is in escrow. (Hedging is a safeguard for Vendors, and Escrow is a safeguard for Buyers). This is much more relavent for Vendor&#039;s, as they are more likely to have large sums of BTC sitting in their wallets. But with hedging, regardless of what happens to the BTC climate, they won&#039;t be effected.<br /><br />For us measly buyers that have BTC in our wallets on SR, well we&#039;re not protected and don&#039;t have an option of hedging. Depending on the BTC climate we are at risk of either gaining or losing $. We&#039;re just lucky that BTC prices are still increasing for now.

				I should have been able to get my bitcoins about 8 hours earlier, but for some reaosn the place never gave me a coupon code to enter, and the bitcoin price went up by almost 10 dollars, costing me about 50 bucks, just for their mistake. Oh well. =/
