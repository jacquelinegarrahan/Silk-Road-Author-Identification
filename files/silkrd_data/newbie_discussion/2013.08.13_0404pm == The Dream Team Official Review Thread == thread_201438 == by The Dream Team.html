				This is a review for the needlepoint 200ug LSD quality and potency only.<br /><br />I was amazed at how clean this L was. No body ache, no mental fuck (some people like that, but I cant stand it), and some pretty amazing visuals.<br /><br />T - 0 I had some friends over and we all dosed.<br />T - 1hr Start getting slight tracers and vivid colors<br />T - 1.5hrs Become impatient and several of us decided to double up while some decided to hold off.<br />T - 2.5hrs Finally start to get some amazing visuals. Extremely vivid color effects and with kaleidoscope vision and what seemed like hundreds of tracers crossing my eye sight.<br />T - 3 hrs Feel the second hit coming in and decide that the quality is amazing. To see what I was seeing and not have any mental fuck at all or body load was perfect for me. <br />T - 6 or 7 hrs The trip starts to wind down, but the party continues to go through the night.<br /><br />I continued to eat more, which may sound a little crazy, but I felt confident enough that I would not get any anxiety or get lost in my head due its cleanliness. On the flip side of the coin, I should have only NEEDED 1 - 2 , in my opinion.<br /><br />We all felt that the L was a major creeper and that it did not feel like 200ug L since many of us had to double up. None of us mixed anything else in our bodies until we felt the trip was winding down.<br /><br />I have had JackieChan&#039;s L and Tesselated too. I would say that neither of theirs was as clean/pure feeling as this (they had WOW Fluff), but were definitely on point with the amount per hit. The Dream Team&#039;s is a bit over shot with how much you get per hit and I would say its closer to the 120ug area. 150ug at the MAX.<br />
