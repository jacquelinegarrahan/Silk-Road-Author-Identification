				SO, to get what I wanted I had to FE. I chose 4 vendors that operated in my country to avoid customs aggro.<br />Pleased to say that all 4 packages arrived safely!<br />It&#039;s going&nbsp; to be a fun weekend!

				Could you say which vendors? Im about to plunge into the dangers of FE due to being new (and the better prices offered with those vendors). I feel rather confident since their review thread looks pretty promising:<br /><br />LucyDrop - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=59440.msg774604#msg774604<br /><br />MarijuanaIsMyMuse - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=41902.0<br /><br />Maybe not so much on MJisMyMuse...<br />

				Glad it worked for you mate. <br /><br />Note to others<br />Buying something might be worth a chance if losing that amount is no big loss for you. Just no crying when you get fucked, we don&#039;t want to hear it!

				do not FE for nipplesuckcanuck. He&#039;s definitely scamming. Offering 10% bonus for FE just to cash in quick it seems. Before he ripped me off I had FEd 8 or 9 times without issues. I like to think of it as an act of good faith. Til I got ripped.... no more FE for me. I won&#039;t do business with them if they require it.

				just to add to the FE talk....i&#039;v had to FE due to being new.......I now have 10 transactions after buying ebooks and digital goods....some vendors have a 10 minimum but some are now 15 minimum succesful tranactions before you dont need to FE its a joke! 15 especially <br />iv had one tranaction that I FE not show yet- ordered 10th January from FM he has a good rep so should get a reship or something sorted but comms are really bad<br />iv got one tranaction ordered from last weekend not arrived FE <br />but in fairness FE from Sonicdrone arrived no bother in good time-<br />all three were 1g coke <br />now ordered cheaper goods to boost my transactions to try and avoid having to risk a FE...........which if FE lets the vendor dispatch at his pleasure, if proper escrow used dispatch times would be quicker I&#039;d imagine

				i like the mindset of &quot;don&#039;t spend what you aren&#039;t willing to lose&quot; or similar, because theres always a risk involved

				Personally I think it&#039;s criminal for vendors to be asking FE from domestic buyers with tracking. International orders without tracking&nbsp; custom issues yeah I have no dramas with that.
