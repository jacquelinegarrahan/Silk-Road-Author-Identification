				I am not a moderator or hero member, However, I believe both of them would agree with what I have to say.<br /><br />DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR ADDRESS/DROP-POINT INFORMATION TO ALLEGED NEW VENDORS OFFERING &quot;FREE SAMPLES&quot;!!!<br /><br />This could cause you much more trouble than you could possibly imagine.. If you want to submit reviews for free samples then please do so with someone who actually has a vendor account. I cannot stress how important it is to avoid making any type of transaction through the forums. <br /><br />Offering and Requesting free samples of anything and exchanging your BTC for the shipping is completely unethical on the forums and should only take place on SilkRoadvb5piz3r.Onion Where ESCROW is in place to protect you from possible scams. <br /><br />Also, One of the worse things that could happen on the forums when you have provided your &quot;Drop&quot; address to someone you believe could be a potential new and trustworthy vendor is blackmailing you for BTC. Remember if you&#039;ve provided a &quot;New Vendor&quot; who hasn&#039;t set up a Vendor account yet then you may very well be subject to this scam. I hope that most of you understand not to do this. <br /><br />This is for your protection and anonymity&#039;s sake. <br /><br />Please use Silk Road the way it was intended and most of all have fun :D

				Hey Baggie.&nbsp; I noticed you added an avatar of a very tiny baggie of weed.&nbsp; I just wanted to upload some other choices of nice avatars that fit your name well.&nbsp; I have a selection of five for you.<br /><br />My favorite.&nbsp; A baggie of two juicy eyeballs http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/UHbj.png<br />An animated ziplock baggie http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/IqJr.gif<br />Another animated baggie http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/4ihL.jpg<br />The top of a real ziplock baggie http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/YT41.gif<br />And four generic weed baggies of various sizes http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/nopx.png<br /><br />They all have transparent backgrounds so that they will blend in nice on the forum without having that square background look.&nbsp; Of course you do not have to take any of my suggestions.&nbsp; I&#039;m just throwing them out there. 8)
