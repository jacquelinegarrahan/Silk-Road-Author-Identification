				Hello,<br /><br />my package got lost or it is being seized! Im in paranoia! I ordered 14 days ago, domestic. I put in the wrong address I guess, which was really painfully stupid! i had checked multiple times if all was right and also contacted the vendor to see if everything is correct. Everything seemed ok. After 5 days of waiting and having to FE i got worried. I checked tracking and found that the package that arrived in my city got send back to the senders address! I made some inquires about it with tor. I contacted DHL and asked what happened and they said the receiving address is unknown and they have already sent it back to the sender, which can in return check it for redelivery. This is not going to happen because the senders address does not exist. So the package is lost in transition and i think it is only a matter of time when they inspect upon it! LE will start to find out about that! My P.O. Box ID will be unmasked and they will find out about my location!!!<br /><br />I NEED HELP!!!!

				One more thing, the p o box that i am using is under a different name but the box in itself is linked to the place i live. The name that i am using belongs to the person that used to live in this place. Also i was there once at the box to empty it and also to check. This was the only time i have been there... If LE do start to inspect they will presumably ask for footage of the last weeks or months of the post office, where they can see me open that shit up! The person that used to live here is a different gender.

				I guess it depends on how much you ordered, vendor stealth and the way he operates.<br /><br />If the recieving address was unknown, causing a RTS, then they can&#039;t connect that to your correct PO Box address or am I missing somthing?<br /><br />Anyway try to chill. Nobody likes to loose a package. What&#039;s your vendor say?<br />

				what does the DHL do with lost packages? If no more inquires about it? I shouldn&#039;t have done the p o box thing because of the ultimate link to my location. First off it was difficult finding the right name and identification for the box because if you activate one all the recipients letters will automatically get sent to the p o address, this was the perfect match for one stint only. I felt more comfortable doing this because of also not finding a trustable friend to receive. I don&#039;t directly want to eat where I shit, but in this case this is the fact! What are my options, am I totally fucked or am I overreacting on the situation? I guess as long as the address was incorrect and me not having a contract with DHL about the package, I should be out if they don&#039;t further ask about who the owner of this box is?

				I ordered a amount that is enough to get me in trouble, thats for sure. I actually did use the right address but it was presumably put in wrong, because of the confusion of this fucking address. The postal code was switched in the process or some shit.. The postal code of the p o box is different from the postal code of the building the p o box is being kept at. This might be a factor. However this thing is floating in a grey area and could be opened at any time...

				They may keep it for weeks to months. Then open it to try to get a clue about where to deliver it. So a lot will depend on what return address system your vendor uses. If it&#039;s well stealthed it may get destroyed.

				Try to relax. This package isn&#039;t connected to you, doesn&#039;t have your fingerprints on it. If by some chance they can get it to correct PO box, then you haven&#039;t heard of that person, and you never ordered from there. Plain and simple, nothing else they can prove. <br />I would suggest getting a different delivery setup. <br /><br /><br />WRONG name ( Not YOU, or related to you)<br />WRONG address(if they couldn&#039;t deliver initially, and no one at senders address to correct it, then it will likely not be sent out a 2nd time)<br />If it sits in limbo somewhere and is opened, it is just another undeliverable package they dispose of.<br />Please, when we panic we make mistakes. Read the security thread, there are some good advice on receiving also. Make a better plan, and move on. After all----THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU RIGHT?!<br />

				Chill out man. You made a really unfortunate error that is definitely going to cost you your order and probably get you banned from ever doing business with that seller again. But if you put the wrong address on the package, how could they ever trace it back to you? It wasn&#039;t your address on the package... Shipping companies deal with mislabeled packages all the time. They will try sending it back to the shipper, when that doesn&#039;t work it will probably end up in a giant pile of unclaimed packages and eventually get thrown away. It&#039;s not something I would lose much sleep over. You lost your money and got yourself banned by that seller. The DEA isn&#039;t going to be kicking your door in tonight. Learn from it and move on.
