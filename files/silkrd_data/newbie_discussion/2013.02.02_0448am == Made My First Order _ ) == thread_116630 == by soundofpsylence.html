				I&#039;m just trying to increase my post count without spamming. So, just wanted to say, I am very excited about this first order. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been waiting for the 1st of Feb. I&#039;ve been looking at all of the opportunities available. I wanted to get some ganj, dmt. I saw the Spirit Molecule movie after I heard Joe Rogan and wanted to check it out. Trying to find it in my area is a joke. People will laugh at you for asking about it and then ask you to let them know if you ever find some. Nevertheless, I have a friend who offered me salvia, or whatever its called, but then couldn&#039;t find his stash. Whatever, after watching the youtube videos, I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t get a chance to try it. <br /><br />DMT, though, I&#039;ve been thinking about. It is definitely something I want to do alone. So far, I have plans of making a vaporizer from a 3Liter bottle, so that I can safely break through without risking burning down the place. I was interested in the weed because of the price/quality ratio. I know someone who sells a gram of shwag for 20, but the stuff I have an order for looks righteous.<br /><br />BTW, its real simple to go through BitInstant to BlockChain.info...they have a way to chop up and further anonymize your coins for an extra 1%. <br /><br />Whatever. I need to reach 50 posts so that I can leave good reviews for the stuff I am going to get in the next week, but I didn&#039;t want to lower myself to spamming all over the place.

				Yes I&#039;m fighting the temptations of joining those spam threads as well. I too, just made my first order about 2 months ago. Unfortunately, not being educated about which vendors were reliable and not doing vendor research or anything at that, it resulted in a failed transaction for me. Hope all goes well for your first though!

				Yeah I&#039;m also on that noblesque quest to make it to 50 posts without spamming. A bit of ranting maybe, but I&#039;m trying to contribute intelligent content overall. Congrats on your first order! <br /><br />Ahhh DMT. I remember the nice white snowglobes...ahem. <br /><br />It sounds like you are setup for a nice time with the vape. I&#039;ve found that DMT produces a markedly different experience when vaporized vs. smoked with an open flame. Probably due to oxides of the molecule being psychoactive as well. If you get the pure crystalline compound (white/colorless) then its actually kind of hard to heat without destroying somewhat unless you have a good vape. I think this is why a lot of people have good experiences with the yellow/orange DMT extracts. They tend to have higher boiling points and are easier to smoke. Unless you buy into that &quot;jungle spice&quot; and &quot;full spectrum&quot; jazz. <br /><br />To each his own.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. Enjoy!

				Exciting stuff indeed. Keep us informed of how you find it :). I&#039;m looking forwards to jumping in and making my first order, mdma and some cocaine. Just reading lots of stuff on forum here and coming up to speed. What a cool site.<br /><br />
