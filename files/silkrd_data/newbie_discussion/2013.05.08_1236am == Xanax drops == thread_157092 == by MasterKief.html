				Ive been looking into buying about 100 xanax bars for this summers festivities. I saw that its significantly cheaper if you buy it in powder for. I also saw it available in liquid form. My question for you fine people is if I purchase powder form xanax, could it be mixed with water to make a dropable solution? Or would i have to mix it with some other nonreactive liquid?

				Well my friend, unless you have a 0.001mg precision scale i wouldnt even attempt taking alprazolam powder due to the fact you only want about 2mgs in one go and you cant do it by eye with such a potent CNS. Believe me you drown in your own mucus depressed on the lungs on an overdose. Not nice.<br /><br />I would advise to just buy the bars man, much safer, reliable quality, and a general ease. Well worth the extra 50 bucks or however much if you ask me, but then that&#039;s my opinion.<br /><br />Have fun and safe partying!<br /><br />Astrona<br />

				Yea i&#039;m aware of the low thresh dosages of the substance, not to worry. Im also a chem major and have access/can purchase a micro measurement scale. My concern is in the solution. I want to say i can just use water and mix a .5mg per drop solution but at the same time i feel like thats a horrible idea because water might ruin the substance or something. IDK.<br /><br />Thank you for the advice and the well wishes though&nbsp; ;D

And a lot that is other stuff, like phenazapam, or even ground up bars, I got some from Costco, and it is pretty good. I really like it, it just seems to last too long. Maybe I am taking too much (probably 4-5 mg sometimes). But I would recommend them, if they&#039;re in stock.

				I agree with Astrona, unless you have precision measure tools and know<br />exactly how much powder, I would stick to bars as well...<br />better safe than sorry!
