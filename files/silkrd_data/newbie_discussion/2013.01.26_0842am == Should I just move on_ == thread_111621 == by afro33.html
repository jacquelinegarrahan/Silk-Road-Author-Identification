				Hello all.<br /><br />I just performed my first purchase from a vendor named HardWired. His reputation was 100, and he has been selling Adderall for over 8 months. <br />I FEd, and reviewed well.<br /><br />The day after I purchased, he went in to Stealth mode, and I haven&#039;t heard anything from him. I&#039;m on day 3, no response, and no Adderall :(<br /><br />Should I rate him down, report him, and move on?<br />

				Since you finalized early, it&#039;s unlikely that you&#039;ll get your money back if he did indeed scam you.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Definitely report it to SR Support so they can look into it!

				So sorry to hear that, afro33.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; The only thing I can recommend is reporting the vendor and contacting SR Support.&nbsp; Hopefully if enough people report the vendor, they&#039;ll ban him before he can scam anyone else.

				I think there is no other way to move on. On the other hand if you only waited 3 days, you might aswell wait a little more until you contact the staff.

				In future you can leave the &#039;post feedback&#039; comment until later on, which has the advantage of placing your comment at the top of the vendor&#039;s/item&#039;s first page, much more effective if you&#039;ve been scammed and are encountering a non communicative vendor.<br />

				Same sit for me but I&#039;m in escrow - 9 days for a domestic small order. Definitely will not buy from this guy again even if it shows... tells me he is too busy, leaves listings up regardless of supply or time to ship, or says fk u to someone with few or no transactions.

I knew it was likely that I&#039;d get scammed since I had read a lot of the forums and warnings about NEVER FINALIZE EARLY, unless of course you know they guy and have done business with him before. The seller that took me also had a very high rating and I had also read some positive reviews of his product on this forum, so apparently he doesn&#039;t ALWAYS scam...maybe just creates a new account, sells some product, then scams some people before moving onto another account. Oh well, I knew what I was getting into. Found another seller that while not domestic didn&#039;t require FE, so I went with that and had a nice and easy transaction. About to sample the product for the first time today. Yippee! Hopefully your purchase wasn&#039;t too expensive. I lost about $40-50 in mine. Not the end of the world, but still stings.

				You should move on from all vendors that require fe.<br />FE is an easy way to selective scam members.<br />In two years i&#039;ve never allowed a vendor make up his own rules to have the privilege of my business and it has only hurt the vendor not me because there is always an alternative to the vendor in question.<br />Maybe not that particuklar hour but products are listed ina 24/7 fashion and what might not be listing this hour might be half the price by another vendor just hours later.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad<br />

				I got taken in by HardWired as well, so don&#039;t feel too bad.&nbsp; That transaction was my 4th here and the first time I ever FEed and it will most certainly be my last.<br /><br />The reason he went down to 89 just before he went into stealth mode is because a couple of reviewers dropped him from 5/5 to 1/5.&nbsp; I would recommend you go in and change your rating, as I did, just in case he ever comes back and tries to scam more people.&nbsp; It&#039;s unlikely, but just maybe we can stop some people in the future from making a horrible mistake.<br /><br />I&#039;ve decided to just move on and look at it as a learning experience.

				Thanks everyone for the feedback.<br /><br />I did lose about $50, definitely not the end of the world, but yeah it stings :(<br /><br /><br />However, I haven&#039;t lost motivation and I have definitely learned a lesson: Avoid vendors that require me to FE. <br /><br />Also I am reporting HardWired. Anyone who searches his name should do likewise as well I guess.<br />

				Theres definately things you only properly learn when youve made a few orders. Iv spent quite a reasonable amount on sr but im still a noob. I just recently lost $250 to the Heineken buying 40 pills. I didnt fe until 5 days in when I still hadnt received the package but I was coming up on some green question marks and as im checking his vendor page (as I do every 5 minutes when im waiting for a parcel) I read how he appreciates if peeps do fe. Well at this point im feeling pretty empathetic to the guy I mean what do I have to worry about? A guy that sells these god candies why wouldnt I trust him? Anyway I fucked myself up. Once you fe any refund u get is outside the sr system which immediately makes it look like your trying to scam yet protect your stats. Add to that he know even if I change my feedback it wont go to the top where people read it. So when my fails to show after a LONG time I request a reship. Now I have to be careful what I say here because I could be just unlucky but 2 in a row to 2 different addresses is a little suspicious with no customs letters (but do they always send them?) Im not calling him a scammer because i dont think he is but theres very little motivating him to send the reship other than pure honesty (plus he had to believe I wasnt lying)<br />Long story short iv lost out on $250 iv come to terms with that (just about) but in future im going to give them every motivation to get my shizzle to me like not FE&#039;ing and not leaving feedback till you get it else nobody flicks to page 7 when they read feedback<br /><br />Worst part was I sent him an extra 2.3 btc I had lying around wen I asked for the reship In order that he might give me extra stealth as well as to cover some of his costs of a resend. I really should stay off sr wen im rolling...<br /><br />
