				I just popped into this section to say the same thing. <br /><br />I won&#039;t count him out yet - but this is looking an awful lot like PlanetExpress. I hope he&#039;s legit. I really, really do...<br /><br />But sweet jesus, mother of mary god - don&#039;t FE to this guy. <br /><br />DO NOT FE EVER!

				I saw him too.&nbsp; Products are way under-priced and he seems stocked with everything and in large amounts.&nbsp; I wrote Libertas about it and asked if there was a was SR could monitor this guys.&nbsp; No reply yet as I just wrote him.&nbsp; And then there is Emporium Express which for all I know could be Planet Express under a new account.&nbsp; Both vendors merit close attention&nbsp; until they prove themselves.

				I totally agree! However, I bet tomorrow we&#039;ll see pages and pages of &quot;FE for trusted vendor!&quot; Hope my shit comes! <br /><br />Although with the new feedback system that&#039;s not possible to change your feedback anymore.&nbsp; I really hope the new feedback system doesn&#039;t help scammers stay up longer because nobody can see all the FE&#039;s.

				Emporium Express looks questionable as well.&nbsp; After reading his discussion thread, he&#039;s definitely a douche. Just don&#039;t know if he&#039;s a scammer yet.&nbsp; Still every instinct tells me to stay away.

				KO definitely looks like some more Planet Express bullshit.<br />As for Emporium Express, his reviews seem to be decent, and my bud ordered a sample off of him and it came through after about a week. He just doesn&#039;t seem very experienced with any of this.

				All this &quot;DONT FE EVER&quot; sounds just about right, but vendors that only sell in Rashka after you FE + 5/5 are just about everywhere, and I can understand them, no one wants their reputation be spoiled by a shitty Rashkian VodkaPost.<br />So, sometimes you have to FE. You just need to be careful.<br />I once trusted a man with almost 1k$, and he didn&#039;t let me down. But I felt like a retard for almost a month that was spent waiting for package.<br />And in 2007 when I was working as a teacher, I ordered 17 Kubuntu CDs, and they never came. <br />Them odds.<br />Sorry for off-topic.

				^^^^ NEVER FE.<br />That honestly can&#039;t be stressed enough. <br />If you don&#039;t FE, you can very easily avoid a scammer.

				For what it&#039;s worth I bought a listing from EmporiumExpress for 8 free Redbox movie promo codes. Well only 2 of the 8 worked and I messaged him about it. Got a vague apology and he said it could be maybe they just don&#039;t work where I live. My opinion is stay away.

				FUCK the damned &#039;if it&#039;s too good to be true it is rule&#039;<br /><br />Was hovering over ordering some roxies because his price on them is insane by comparison to other vendor&#039;s, but I knew that meant some shit was up.<br /><br />Glad I found this thread.<br /><br />I might order off him, and contact SR from my vendor account as soon as I do, and no matter what he tries to do i&#039;ll refuse FE.&nbsp; Then when he takes it to SR they already know all about it, and perhap&#039;s catch a fuckbag (scammer).<br /><br />Anyone know a roxy vendor who&#039;ll ship to Canada and not ask me for my left nut in payment? heh

				I am pretty sure we cnanot cancel it. I read this in the FAQ:<br /><br />&nbsp;My order hasn&#039;t arrived or it&#039;s not what I expected.<br /><br />If your order hasn&#039;t come after waiting 10 days, you should click &quot;resolve&quot; next to it on your orders page. This will put the order into resolution. Read all of the instructions in the Resolution Center, and try to come to an agreeable resolution with your vendor. <br /><br />So, come back after 10 days of him marking it &quot;in transit&quot; and the resolve link should be clickable.<br /><br />I may or may not also post in the customer support forum. If after a while nothing happens with that post, I will contact SR support through the website (click the support link in the bottom right of SR).<br /><br />you will probably want to do the same so SR support can see that this KetamineOcean fucker is a fucker.
