				Hey, <br /><br />I placed an order with this vendor yesterday, as it was my first time he asked me to FE so i did (probably stupdily) and now it appears all of his listings are gone and when I clock his username it just takes me to our messages not his store/homepage. <br /><br />Anyone else experienced this?<br /><br />I think i did get scammed but im hoping not!<br /><br />Cheers

				Dunno what to tell you that was Real Dumb. It&#039;s only money, and lesson learned. Never FE early, especially never for new vendors.

There have been a few &#039;established&#039; vendors have started requesting FEs and then just run off with the cash.<br /><br />Plenty of people work inside the escrow system, why take the risk?

				Others may not agree with me but I say don&#039;t finalize until you not only have the package in hand but have made sure that it is indeed the actual product you ordered. It would suck to pay for flour when you wanted coke.

If I buy E, i can&#039;t be expected to put my life on hold and roll the day the package comes. I know you can edit feedback, but I dont think its fair to not leave anything for a week+ until you can use the stuff. Some drugs last a very long time.

				I&#039;d say never FE until you&#039;re positive you got what you paid for. It helps to have some test strips around or a friend who doesn&#039;t have a life and likes to take drugs to guinea pig it.
