				Title: <strong>Controlled delivery</strong><br />

				I just received my first package, and everything was fine. I didn&#039;t have to sign; it was just on my doorstep. <br />My question is: do controlled deliveries exist wherein there is no one delivering it? Instead could they be waiting for me to open it and will come knocking in a day or two?<br />I&#039;m probably just being paranoid, but it&#039;s better safe than sorry.<br />Thanks!

				Not likely.&nbsp; If they thought you had it there now, they would move right away knowing that even a hour later and it could be.... GONE.&nbsp; Good to think scenarios.&nbsp; But don&#039;t sweat this one.&nbsp; Not impossible mind you but highly unlikely. 8)

				That&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking, I can&#039;t find any actual occurrences of that happening.<br />Some people just mentioned it on a forum I was reading, but no one actually had any evidence. <br />Also, after reading up on how the USPS handles that kind of stuff, it doesn&#039;t seem in their procedure to handle things like that.<br />I still want to see if anyone here has an example of this happening, or can confirm it even does.

				Yeah, you&#039;ll be cool, man. The only thing you DO NOT DO is sign for anything. Once you do that, and say LE is waiting for you, you&#039;re fucked. <br />I wouldn&#039;t worry, though. USPS has no interest in the contents of your package at all...
