				Ever since I&#039;ve been on SR I&#039;ve noticed the only method available is crystal meth. Now I&#039;m not complaining or anything but I do have 1, maybe two questions. When people I know would get meth, 90% of the time it was the white rocky/powdery stuff, locally made by some hillbilly which usually was awesome but a lot dirtier than ice. Rougher comedown, more side effects, but more rush and energy. Is there a specific name for that type of meth because I&#039;ve seen vendors listing &quot;methamphetamine&quot; but it was crystal?&nbsp; Also why is no one selling it??

				I think meth is meth. It&#039;s varying on grades of purity. From what I&#039;ve seen the most desirable forms are<br /><br />1. Desoxyn prescription meth<br /><br />2. Ice<br /><br />3. Powder<br /><br />But it&#039;s all meth and it all gets you high. Ice is more desrable because people get a hard on for a big humk of something but it does not indicate much about quality. Powder meth is just as good if it&#039;s not cut and doesn&#039;t need crushed/cut up.

				the hillbillies down here call that dirty power meth &quot;crank&quot;, it ain&#039;t as pure as crystal or ice and it makes fuckers hell of crazy but there is a strange sector of trashy MF&#039;s who prefer that shit and if you are one of them, more power to you. hit up the trailer parks where you live and you might find some. I can&#039;t imagine anyone selling that dirty shit on the road, but if vending prices went way the fuck down maybe some hillbilly folk would sling their wares up here for shits and giggles. who knows? oh and dont get me wrong, i know plenty of crazy hillbillies that sell only the purest fuckin shards, but when mama makes it in the bathtub thats when shit gets hairy.

				I have seen several types of meth. The most common is the &quot;one pot recipe.&quot; That&#039; the regular powdery crystal. I have seen what we call &quot;shards&quot; here. Which is bigger solid crystals with a almost clear appearance. The clearer the crystal, USUALLY the more pure, some will have a yellowish tint to it. The clear clear clearest is Ice, or really pure shards. Then you have what we call &quot;shooters speed&quot; which is solid yellow, almost waxy looking chunks. Hurts like a fucker to snort, worse than any other type. Sometimes it will have little curly q looking strands in it. Some guys call it &quot;bathtub batch,&quot; but I haven&#039;t seen it since the 90&#039;s. <br /><br />Once I was with a friend in a bar a few towns away, and his buddy had some &quot;purple puffs.&quot; Really clean crystal type high, but purple, jagged looking balls in the bag. Looked like it was a fucked up batch, but the guy swore he&#039;d been getting it the same way for years.

				Dirt unfiltered shakenbake crank is what you describe as hillbilly meth and the reason it&#039;s not listed here is most meth users would never choose dirty cut to shit crank over crystal.<br />So to answer your question there is no market for bullshit methamphetamine.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				Lol something about OP&#039;s post tells me that you shouldn&#039;t even be messing with meth. Even you described that the &quot;hillbillie powdered meth&quot; to have a harsher comedown. What does that mean to you? It&#039;s either unfiltered or cut or both. I don&#039;t even get why people bother with meth, I mean I admit, its quite good if its very low dose and taken orally...and even then you still get that post-tweaking stimulant induced psychosis no matter what. Not my type of thing when the party is long dead and you haven&#039;t slept for 12+ hrs, while scavenging your medicine cabinet for any downers to bring you down. I learnt thru the hard way that only hypnotics like seroquel can truly bring you down from over-doing meth after been trying every benzo known to man and smoking copious amount of pot which only added to more paranoia and produce vivid hallucinations.

Crystal meth.....well there really isn&#039;t any other substances to compare with, I mean there are cheap RCs out there and analogs that may try to mimic some qualities of it, but nothing comes close.

				Well this is how it goes in Australia and pretty sure America, people cant seem to understand the chemistry or logic behind it..<br />We have &quot;SPEED&quot; which is brown/yellow crystalline powder.. This is not actually Amphetamine as everyone believes.<br />It is actually an unfinished stage of making meth, a byproduct i guess?<br /><br />It is not amphetamine but part levo-methamphetamine, part dextro-methamphetamine and usually part MSM(Cutters).<br />The levo(-) part doesn&#039;t do much except a real eyes peeled back frustrated high followed by a yuk comedown usually insomnia psychosis...<br /><br />Essentially &quot;ICE,CRYSTAL METH&quot; is solely pure dextro-methamphetamine...<br /><br />These are both METH Hcl, we knows this cause you can smoke it in a glass pipe.. Methamphetamine Hcl is basically the only salt stable enough at room temperature that can be vaporized..<br /><br />Why do people call it &quot;SPEED-Amphetamine?&quot; Because Amphetamine is harder and more expensive to make. Meth is cheap and easy and stronger..<br />Amphetamine is basically on stable at room temp as a Sulfate, Phosphate or Fumarate, These salts burn and do not vaporize<br /><br />No one really makes Amp-Sulfate anymore except Europe, but they also don&#039;t have nearly as much ICE-Meth Hcl Amp-Sulfate is too expensive and not as easy to manufacture.<br /><br />Meth Hcl is easy stronger and you get more bang for your buck cutting unfinished ice with MSM and selling it as &quot;SPEED-AMPHETAMINE&quot;.<br />And from my experience its generally stronger than Europe&#039;s Amp-sulfate.<br /><br />Knowledge is Power..

				Meth is generally always clear.<br />If its cloudy it has MSM in it.<br />If its red it probably has DYE from the pills it was make with, It is not a cause of red phosphorus, that should have been removed by now.<br />If its blue, it has food color in it not different..<br /><br />Hot Tip-- If you wanna be a dodgy cunt put RED, Orange, Pink Food dye in your meth (ICE or Aus Speed) or MDMA people pay more for it cause they thinks it&#039;s better, a mate of mine did it..

				Methamphetamine is methamphetamine.&nbsp; What do you mean by &quot;types&quot; of meth?<br /><br />Crystallized methamphetamine is just a salt of methamphetamine - such as methamphetamine HCl or methamphetamine phosphate, whatever.<br /><br />When the acid is removed, you&#039;ll have the free-base of methamphetamine - that is, just methamphetamine itself, which probably doesn&#039;t crystallize too well.<br /><br />While nice looking crystals are often a good indication that a product is of high quality, it&#039;s not true that poor crystal quality (or no crystals at all) indicates low quality.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t expect methamphetamine itself (or &quot;freebase meth&quot; if you will) to crystallize.&nbsp; It may seem counterintuitive, but that would technically mean that non-crystalline methamphetamine (existing as the free base) could actually be more pure than a nice crystal of methamphetamine salt (because the HCl adds weight to the product).

I&#039;m wondering whether you are a user of methamphetamine. You obviously have a grasp on the chemistry and I&#039;ve been wondering lately if there might be some new precursors making their way into the market as it seems the end product is changing even within it&#039;s own &quot;class&quot;. Meaning... &quot;ice&quot; from XYZ guy is NOT &quot;ice&quot; from Kush (mmm) even tho they look alike, have the same texture, vaporize at similar temps, smell the same, etc. <br />Now, on the other hand, crank is crank and that can be a good time once in a blue moon.&nbsp; ;) Thoughts? <br />

				Yeah dude i know MSM wont get you high.<br />&nbsp;Basically what im saying is you cant smoke/vaporize Amphetamine cause it is only a powder form as a salt which will burn before vaporize (sulphate/phosphate..)<br />Meth on the other hand can be vaporized because it&#039;s that tiny bit bigger and its stable as a HCL salt which happens to be the only salt that can vaporize with certain chemicals. (Not entirely true..)<br /><br />Amphetamine is an oil in a freebase form and im pretty sure meth is liquid as freebase too, (Not sure about meth&#039;s freebase form any idea&#039;s yell out).<br /><br />If you can smoke it it&#039;s meth, maybe its shit, dirty, unfinished meth but it is meth..<br />You just cant smoke Amp salts and Amp base is oil..

				The amount of judgement being passed through this thread is disheartening to say the least.<br /><br />Really, a forum based on the sale of pretty much every drug over the internet and people want to judge someone for preferring a certain drug?<br /><br />Get real.
