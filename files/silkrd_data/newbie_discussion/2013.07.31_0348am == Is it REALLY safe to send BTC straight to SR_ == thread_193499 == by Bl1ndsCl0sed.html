				Hey Guys,<br /><br />Looking for a little adult supervision here&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Two Questions:<br /><br />1) I&#039;ve read that is really is *totally* unnecessary to &quot;tumble&quot; coins through different wallets before landing them on the SR.&nbsp; Is that true?<br /><br />2) Say I&#039;m going directly from coinbase &gt; SilkRoad.&nbsp; Is it safe to type my Silkroad wallet Address into coinbase while I&#039;m on the clearnet?&nbsp; Conversely, is it safe to go onto coinbase.com while on Tor?&nbsp; (I know some websites will &quot;reveal&quot; you, like facebook etc).<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />

				I asked a similar question a few days ago and the answer I picked up from the replies is that YES it is .... unless you plan on spending large (and selling) and are just buying for personal use you shouldn&#039;t have trouble.<br /><br />The question to ask yourself is &quot;will the LE actually be bothered to try and track my bitcoins as proof?&quot; if the answer is no then use your real name etc if the answer is yes than tumble them yourself or use a &quot;fogger&quot;

				Have to say that since Bitinstant went into revamp mode I was thrown for a loop. Needed coin quick, so I started looking around. I have a Dwolla account already in place, but the time restraint was a bitch. Couldn&#039;t find anybody on the local trade sight. So I went with MoneyHoney, under the money section. Bought a Vanilla reload card, (totally anonymous) and was fairly pleased with the transaction. Had to wait overnight, but you can&#039;t expect someone to camp on their site. I figured if the coin is already in SR, The anonimity is already there. Cost is a little higher but a hell of alot less muss and fuss!

				you can CB to a tumbler then to an exchange then spit it to the road... the reason to use the exchange is to keep changing addresses but you can still have a nice stash there.....&nbsp; &nbsp;etc....
