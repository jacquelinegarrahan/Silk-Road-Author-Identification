				Hello,<br /><br />i myself smoke cannabinoids (weed, hash) more than twenty years by now. I never experienced any trouble with my mind or body.<br />But now i get regularly a realy annoying dizziness after i&#039;ve smoked my pipe.<br />It is hard to examine where the problems come from because sometimes it comes, other times it doesn&#039;t....<br /><br />i do not know what it could be and want to ask you if any of you had ever experienced such problems.<br />The dizziness gets sometimes really hard, sometimes it feels like an fast, upcoming attack<br /><br />i&#039;m really disturbed and don&#039;t know how to face the problem.<br /><br />greetz

				Once in a while when i used to smoke way to much pot i would start to get dizzy and all sweaty. about 30 minutes of not being able to walk or talk and being soaked in sweat not to mention being mind fucked i would puke. After that i would feel okay and my normal high would come back. It was really weird.

				Smoking weed and hash, if I remember correctly, lowers you blood sugar and that may be a cause of the dizziness but I&#039;m no doctor just giving you my two cents off of personal experience. I&#039;m pre-diabetic and have to be a little careful about how much I smoke and the munchies I eat when I do. Instead of sweets and junk food I go for fresh fruits and juice smoothies, etc.

				@musichighlife: Thanks for the tip, i will observe that <br /><br />@PanMan123: The amount is not the thing with me, it&#039;s not like i could stop it by smoking less, it can happen after my first pipe that day
