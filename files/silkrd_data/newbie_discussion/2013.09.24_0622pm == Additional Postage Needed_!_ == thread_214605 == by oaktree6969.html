				Title: <strong>Additional Postage Needed?!?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I placed an order for an ounce of weed from a established vendor, and 3 days after it was shipped, I received a letter from the PO requesting additional postage. Of course, I would need to go to the PO to pay it. <br /><br />Why would the USPS wait until the package was at the closest PO to me to request additional postage? How could the package even be shipped without it? The additional amount requested is unusual, meaning it couldn&#039;t have been from a stamp falling off. And if it is from a stamp falling off, as the vendor claims, how is that charged to me? Why wouldn&#039;t the package be returned to sender?<br /><br />Any ideas?

				Actually, it&#039;s not mine until I receive it. I haven&#039;t received it, just a notice. It&#039;s the responsibility of the vendor to ensure the package arrives. How can the buyer have any control over what happens to the package until it arrives?<br /><br />How can I be sure it&#039;s not LE, waiting for me to show up at the PO?

				hes got a point. i think its risk vs reward. <br /><br />If it were an 8th of pot then i would go get it. If it were a kilo of coke...i wouldnt risk it. Work with the vendor and they will take care of you. If not find a new vendor

				The package was likely shipped using stamps and thats how they came up short.<br /><br />They dropped it off in a mailbox short and it wasnt noticed until it reached its destination. Its not uncommon

				They willl always ship it and inforn the reciever that additional postage is required either pay it or dont but the fact is the vendor sent it and you have admited it on the forums so you will have to release the money from escrow orlet it auto finalize either way your money is going to the vendor <br /><br />If LE were trying to catch you they would deliver it and arrest you on the spot not give you a chance not to come pick it up use your brain

The main reason for selecting the shipping I did was NOT to go to the PO. It&#039;s the vendors responsibility to make sure that the package has the required postage to reach its destination, not the buyers.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Then dont pick it up but good luck with that at resolution dick head as I said and slyguy was smart enough to pick up (you clearly weren&#039;t) they have better ways of catching you/wasting money then sitting day after day at a PO waiting in the hope you will turn up

				Doesn&#039;t sound like LE, if they have your address trust me they would rather nab you there than at a post office. Just go pay the extra few dollars and ask the vendor to hook it up a bit next time
