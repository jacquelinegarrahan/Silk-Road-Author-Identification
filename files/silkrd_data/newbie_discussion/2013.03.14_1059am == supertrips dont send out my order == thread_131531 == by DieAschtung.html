				I placed a order 2 days ago and it is still being processed (status:processing). And it clearly states on his page that he sends out the orders the same day.. Anyone else made a order from him in the last 2 days? Did he send yours out or is it also being processed?<br /><br />

				I ordered from him about a week ago (7 days).&nbsp; He marked it as in transit about 2 days after I placed the order.&nbsp; I was checking religiously so that I could finalize early.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t yet received it.. so fingers crossed!<br />

				It is required by him for orders under $1,000. <br /><br />His feedback has been amazing until the last couple of months where many people didn&#039;t seem to get their orders.&nbsp; Many thought he was stealing their money; he has updated his profile saying that his shipping methods weren&#039;t stealth enough and were being compromised.&nbsp; He updated his shipping/packaging methods and people have been receiving their product again.&nbsp; Those who haven&#039;t, for the most part, received 100% refunds or reships that came successfully. <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking my order is probably in my box by now.&nbsp; I&#039;m just out of town and won&#039;t be able to check until Saturday.

				Remember guys, try not to deal with vendors that want to FE early. Been reading the FAQ and Rules, and the nature of this business will always allow bad people to try to come around. Even reputable vendors can go south. Be smart and think before making any purchases. Especially with newish vendors or vendors that want to FE early. Most are probably good, but there&#039;s always gonna be some bad apples.
