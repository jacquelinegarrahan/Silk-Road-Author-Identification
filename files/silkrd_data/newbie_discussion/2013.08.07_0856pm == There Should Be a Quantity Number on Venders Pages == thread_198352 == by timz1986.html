				I think SR should have a quantity number available for buyers to see how much is left of a&nbsp; product they want to buy, i just recently was gonna buy sumthing from a vender and usually i will ask if they still have it but i just ordered cus i wanted it out the same day and it was approaching the cut off time and im sure we have all done that, so with that being said i ordered, well i get a message back an hour later they sold out of that item i was like ok no biggie send my coin back and cancel the order they didnt do it for over 3 hrs, and i noticed they kept the listing up for like 2 hrs i think that is dead wrong to do its just a pain in the ass to get a funds back from a vender who is busy with orders, i wont name names but still and also sum of the top venders will not answer any questions about anything or it takes them 12 plus hours to answer and by then ive moved on, so now i find myself asking vendors if they still have ect ect, and i get wise ass remarks if the listing is up i have it, that may be tru but how am i the buyer to know this i think it would save alot time for the buyer if we knew Joe Doe have 10 grams of dope of left, and an hour later he has 0 so you cant place an order unless the vender updates his profile that he got more ect ect you know what im getting at but do you think sumthing like this could ever happen?????? it could be very beneficial for both parties .

				I think this is a genius idea! And allow vendors to opt-out, or select &#039;infinite&#039; if they are uncomfortable with that system. I really think this should get implemented!<br /><br />(btw, try to use paragraphs - you made my head hurt a little reading that)

				Hi.<br /><br />There is a quantity number displayed, to see it add the item to your cart, on the next page it will display a default quantity ordered of 1, and next to that the number of that item available. If you go back from there, it will show an order in your cart, but if you were just checking then clear your order quantity down to 0, and update. Your cart will then be empty. But things move pretty quickly so if there is little available of the item and you don&#039;t order there and then, it may be gone when you go back.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />Take care.

				Ah, I did not know this. I still think it should be right by the listings on the vendor page tbh

				It&#039;s a good idea but:<br /><br />I&#039;m a vendor on SR and we need to give a quantity when making a listing. <br />I&#039;m a new vendor and don&#039;t know what will happen if it counts to 0. <br />It would be logical that the listing goes into stealth until vendor adds quantity.<br />Only when a vendor give a bigger quantity then he actually haves it can be sold out before the listing is sold out.

				yes i know but sumtimes theres like an infinite&nbsp; number there and that makes no sense like stated above i ordered and it said they had over 100 so i thought i was good come to find out they had none and kept the posting up so what the heck is the point of that ya know and instead of having to go and put that item in ur cart and leave that page it should just be displayed on the venders page

				With vendors who keep on top of their inventory, they will list a few less than they have on hand so when it runs out &amp; the listing automatically comes down they still have the option to add a few more, rather than saying they have more than they do, &amp; overselling &amp; having to contact all of the customers that ordered the extra orders.<br /><br />NCK
