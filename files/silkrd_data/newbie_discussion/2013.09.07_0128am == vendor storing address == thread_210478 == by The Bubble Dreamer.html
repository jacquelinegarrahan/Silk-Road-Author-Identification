				Title: <strong>vendor storing address</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>The Bubble Dreamer</strong> on <strong>September 07, 2013, 01:28 am</strong>

				<br />I recently had a package not arrive within the expected time frame, so I contacted the vendor. He asked for my address to verify. Once I gave him the address he knew exactly the date he shipped on. I find this a bit worrying, I don&#039;t like the idea that a vendor has my address stored, for example in case LE searches his house or computer. Maybe the vendor took appropriate measures, like encrypting the addresses (I of course provided the address encrypted to start with), but still, I expect the vendor to delete the address right after printing it on a label. Or am I being paranoid?

				Did you already finalize. I though most vendors destroy after you finalize. Maybe he waited for you to finalize and leave feedback before destroying address.

				pongeddie: No, I didn&#039;t finalize yet.<br /><br />cryngie: You&#039;re right, and I will take this up with the vendor. (He is well rated and trusted and communicated well).<br /><br />JackJarvisEsq: that might be true, but it could result in LE keeping an eye on my mailbox and intercept other shipments or in LE searching the address (I try not to keep any product at the address but it occasionally happens)<br />

				Yes i believe your address stored in a vendors house is proof who knows they might have product etc as well next to name and addy

				He might not be saving the whole thing. Some vendors only match the zip or the address numbers.<br /><br />But he should not be saving the whole address. <br /><br /><br />And you are saying the vendor straight out asked for your whole address?

				Yep NO vendor that is worth there salt should be saving any complete information regarding a buyers address.<br /><br />Only a snippet at the most for reference incase something goes bad. If you are worried I would honestly ask the vendor this question. Since this does pertain to your personal security as well. So being safe for you is a priority and a peace of mind.

				Maybe the vendor generates some hash value from certain blocks of your address (by using a specific algorithm). This should be safe as well and you don&#039;t have to worry. <br />For example the vendor just have to copy your address; then insert it as it is in a self-made tool, which will print your label and save this hash value connected to the shipping date at the same time. It&#039;s much faster than write down anything manually.<br /><br />SmoothUp

				Vendors shouldn&#039;t store addys... But they do. Be careful, look at what happened to BlufGiraffe...
