				HO has done some great service for me so I&#039;d like to return the favor with this trip report. <br /><br />J, N and I took 1.5 of HollandOnline&#039;s tabs each at around 3pm. The taste was slightly bitter but not unusual. We decided to play some board games for a while until it kicked in. Within 30 minutes I was beginning to feel slightly off. This feeling built up unexpectedly fast and it was becoming increasingly difficult to play the game, as the letters on the cards began shifting around. All of us were rather surprised in how fast it was kicking in. <br />Since it was a beautiful day out, we decided to walk around town. By this time the trip was in nearly full swing, or so I had thought. Colors on everything were bright and fantastic. As we were walking by shops and the busy streets, I got the familiar sense of disconnection from the real world. We were all quiet, lost in our own worlds, although sometimes briefly exchanging current thoughts. &quot;Videogame.&quot; J exclaimed to me, which I took to mean how &quot;fake&quot; and &quot;scripted&quot; everything seemed. In my eyes it feels more like a movie set... all the shops so meticulously decorated yet felt like they were cardboard cutouts if more closely inspected. Meanwhile, J&#039;s attention was drawn to the trunk of a tree, entranced by the liquid-like flow and breathing of the bark. I stared at it for a while as well..until I realized we were still on the sidewalk of a busy street and passerbys were looking at us curiously.&nbsp; <br /><br />We decided to leave the streets and take a short hike up to the top of a well-known lookout point. The mind-effects of the trip were actually still increasing at this point. During the tedious hike I felt the strangest disconnect of mind and body. I had the feeling that I was a seeing, observing mind trapped in an out of shape physical container. I could only see the steep trail in front and I intensely desired to float up and away without the burden of my physical self. By the time we reached the top of the hill at the end of the trail, the sun was beginning to go down. Only then I realized the trip was not yet at its plateau. We sat down and stared at the city, bathed in orange light from the setting sun. The visual aspects of the trip were really starting to take hold at this point. Fantastic kaleidoscopic patterns were lightly transposed upon the vision of the city. It was as if my vision was made up of tiny glass crystals, each reflecting a small band of rainbow color. The city itself was alive and dancing. Buildings were waving back and forth crazily. N, who had never taken this much before, constantly kept glancing from the scene of the city back to us. She told us that she was afraid that her mind would get lost in the chaotic view of the city and had to look over to us to &quot;ground&quot; herself to reality. <br /><br />When the sun finally set the city lights were incredible, but we made our way back down to get some fast food. I found that I was so entranced by the visuals on the hill I forgot that I was tripping (which sounds strange but on acid your mind can really fixate on something such that you lose track of everything else). I started getting a few negative thoughts, uncomfortable with the strange sense of touch and began to get the dreaded thought loops and recursion. I was however able to control myself such that it would not turn into a bad trip. When we reached the restaurant, I confirmed with J and N that I was in no mental state to place an order on food. J, a more experienced tripper than I, decided to order for us. <br /><br />After finally getting food and making it back home, the trip was starting to wind down. We relaxed to some good EDM and watched the Milkdrop visualizer on winamp (highly recommended). As we usually do at the end of trips we put on a film to end the night. This film, &quot;Redline&quot; (animated movie) turned out to be the next best part of the trip for me other than the sunset. As we were still getting color enhancement and breathing, it really complemented the extraordinary animations and was a truly stellar experience (download and watch it! seriously!). At 2am the movie ended but I still had some residual effects of the trip - there still was some wall breathing. This lasted for about another hour or so, and I finally pass out, enjoying a very restful sleep.<br /><br />So all in all this was a fantastic evening... I&#039;d like to give thanks to HO&#039;s amazing product responsible for my great time. I hope this satisfies the curiosity of anyone still on the fence to buy his LSD.<br /><br />sraver
