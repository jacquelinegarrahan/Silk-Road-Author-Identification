				Hi all<br /><br />I&#039;ve been one of the many who made a deposit hours ago and has not seen the funds be credited yet.&nbsp; It was my first bitcoin deposit, done through bitbargain using the address provided by SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been keeping an eye on Blockchain, and up until a short while ago the confirmations had got to 107.&nbsp; Next to the transaction address it has said &#039;unspent&#039; all day....but now shows as &#039;spent&#039; and yet the money is still not in my SR account.&nbsp; Should I be worried at this point??<br /><br />Thanks for any help/advice<br />

				Hi!<br /><br />I am having the same problem as you but with a different service so in my opinion the only party that could be responsible for scamming us would be silk road which seems highly unprobable.<br /><br />I did my deposit about 15 hours ago and still have seen nothing in my account.<br /><br />Please update if/when yours shows up and I will do the same...<br /><br />Like you said, this is a known problem so as long as we have the blockchain info to prove it, I don&#039;t see why we wouldn&#039;t get our money (it&#039;s just a matter of when... I hope)
