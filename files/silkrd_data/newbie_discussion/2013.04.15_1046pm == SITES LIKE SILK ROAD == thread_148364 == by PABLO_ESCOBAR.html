				Watch out for Black Market Reloaded (BMR) they have a different system over there and a lot of the feedback&#039;s are made up or generated to look real. There are &quot;vendors&quot; there who make a &quot;living&quot; off these multiple accounts switching in between them when one goes bad. Its not hard to see when you start researching&nbsp; the feedback. It becomes obvious that the feedback is from a group of the same users all leaving each other positive feedback. like a giant circle of vendors leaving each other positive feedback for transactions that never happened. Sprinkled in between those are a few forced ratings (and forced FE -&gt;Finalized Early thus releasing the funds to them) from real customers. The key is they all want you to FE. No scammer will take escrow. I have seen a &quot;vendor&quot; who ONLY asked for the shipping to be FE and they ONLY robbed that. I guess when you add up a ton of shipping charges it can be a small fortune to a scammer. I have found only 1 person on there of any worth (enki) who also has a SR vendors account here but I dont what name they use and they do escrow. That is the only vendor in my experience that was honest. All the rest that I thought for sure was legit robbed me for more then I want to admit to anyone. Bottom line dont assume other sites work like SR!

				im keeping atlantis in my bookmarks because its the most safest feeling place to go to if sr gets shut down.. the stories of bmr turn me off i hope everybody goes to atlantis instead if sr goes down.. we gotta think of atlantis as an ally at this time rather than a competitor.. so i wont diss them unless they are leo or it gains a nasty bmr reputation. if sr has downtime and the forum goes out id rather find out whats happening about sr by using the atlantis forum so i hope it does well.

				When SR went down last time I was there in the forums and saw the craziness. A lot of people like me learned from just reading the posts during that time that SR can go crazy but it aint going nowhere. Those that took a chance at BMR last time learned their lesson. When SR is down you wait. Hang out in the forums but you dont take a chance elsewhere.<br />Also going down like it did and doing a little maintenance is a huge difference. <br />Now is a good time to brush up on your security. Read the forums and make sure you know what you are doing.<br />
