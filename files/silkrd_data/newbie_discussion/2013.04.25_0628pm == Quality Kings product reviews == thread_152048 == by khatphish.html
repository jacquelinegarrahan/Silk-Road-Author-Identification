				So for like the last hour I&#039;ve been trying to post in the rumor mill for quality kings and give them a solid review until I realized I could only post here which is lame but oh well guess I just need to post more in order to not be a &quot;newbie&quot; lol <br /><br />any who I&#039;ve received 2 orders from QK so far and I&#039;ll go into detail about each one.<br /><br />order 1- Atmos Thermo vape pen with free pre rolled doobie. <br /><br />I received the pen 3 days after ordering Qk was quick with processing and communication was great. The package was vac sealed 2 times for sure and the stinky little doob had an extra vac seal which made me happy. I was very happy with packaging and the product looked exactly how it should. After I blazed the doob I charged up the pen and did as the manual told me. After going through the charging process and doing everything correctly my pen just wouldnt work and I was baffled as to how this could be. Well turns out that the battery keeps flashing telling me that its not charging so I PM&#039;d QK asking him if he could just help me figure out whats wrong and he was quick to ask for my info to make sure I got a working pen. A week later I received my working pen and I couldnt be happier. I read on other forums that some of the thermos come defective from the distributors so this wasnt QK&#039;s fault in any way.<br /><br />order 2- 2g&#039;s of OG wax<br /><br />This shit is the dankest wax I&#039;ve smoked yet. 100% top shelf and im being super jew with it hahaha the taste is unreal It taste like the bud it was made with and the high is very powerful. I woke up and took a huge dab and this shit had me sweating after I coughed my lungs out. The packaging was double vac sealed and even came with a free medicated jolly rancher which was delicious and also potent. I think the whole order from time it was placed to when i received it was about 10 days but this was all due to that bitcoin mishap and the 4/20 overload. Im sure my next order will arrive in 3 days again since im pretty sure he&#039;s all caught up now.<br /><br />My experience with Quality Kings has been great so far and I will def be doing more business sooon :D<br /><br />Post your experience with Quality Kings here as well!!!!!
