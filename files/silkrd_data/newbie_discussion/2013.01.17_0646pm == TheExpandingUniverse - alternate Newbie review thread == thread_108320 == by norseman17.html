				I want to start a review page here for all the Newbies who&#039;ve received samples and can&#039;t post on the normal thread!<br /><br />TheExpandingUniverse hooked me up with a sample of their sour diesel which was shipped Saturday and arrived Thursday (today).&nbsp; <br /><br />Shipping/Packaging:&nbsp; Shipping took about two days longer than other vendors I&#039;ve received from recently but was top notch in quality.&nbsp; The package was inside several layers of packaging, vacuum seal, heat seal, and mylar lining, you couldn&#039;t ask for better packaging!<br /><br />Looks/Smell:&nbsp; The bud came in two nugs and for a .5 g sample it weighed in at just over .64 g.&nbsp; The smell was overwhelming even for this small amount as soon as I opened the bag.&nbsp; There were aromas of super sour lemons and that gasoline like smell you always get with good sour d!&nbsp; Both nugs were covered in trichomes and sticky as fuck! <br /><br />Smoke/Taste:&nbsp; Smoke is typical of a very high grade cannabis with a high thc content.&nbsp; There&#039;s a very sharp feeling in the lungs when you take a deep rip from the bong but the taste of the smoke of pleasant and lemony.&nbsp; <br /><br />High:&nbsp; Intense high that hits you quick and lasts all afternoon, I&#039;ll definitely be buying from TEU again soon!&nbsp; I want to try their pineapple!<br /><br />

				Good idea. I suspect there will be multiple vendors with alternative review pages in the newbie forum soon. :)

				I also received a sample from TheExpandingUniverse of .5g of bud.<br /><br />Strain: Pineapple Kush<br />Weight: Bag was overweight<br />Packaging: Stealthy. Couldn&#039;t smell anything from the outside. Different packaging material (wont go into details). Bud was a little crushed due to soft packaging material.<br />Shipping: It took four days to arrive to the east coast. Package was shipped First Class Mail.<br />Appearance: Frosty dark green nugs. Many orange hairs. Well-trimmed with little to no leaf. Crystals were a mix of cloudy/amber trichomes with intact heads. Nugs are small, tight, dense buds that are coated in trichomes. Bud is well-dried and cured.<br />Smell: Fruity/Sweet/Skunky. More berry/minty than citrus flavors. Distinct pineapple after-smell. Smell is evident but not overwhelming.<br />Taste: Sweet fruity taste similar to smell. Has a distinct kush smell to it. <br />Effect: Strong body buzz. Overall good medicine for a good price.<br />Overall, good bud. Appears to be quality indoor bud with a tight trim. Bud are small, but that is probably due to a small sample order. 4/5<br /><br />Thanks TheExpandingUniverse!

				Yeah, but it seems that the newbie threads are disappearing after a month or so...&nbsp; :-[
