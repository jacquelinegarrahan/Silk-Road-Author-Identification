				I just made my 3rd purchase on the road recently and it&#039;s been 4-days since I made my order for my most recent purchase. The seller has not marked it to in-transit yet, nor responded to my private message. In 5hours I will have the option to &quot;Cancel&quot; my order. <br /><br />If I use the &quot;Cancel&quot; option when it becomes available (before the product has been marked to in-transit as it still says &quot;Processing&quot;. Will that be displayed as a Refund/Refund-Rate% on my purchase stats that other vendors are allowed to view when I purchase from them?<br /><br />Thanks for the time spent to read my question.

				Hope somebody can answer this for me. I paid for expedited/express shipping as well as it&#039;s been processing for about 4-days now. I don&#039;t want to use the &quot;Cancel&quot; option if it&#039;s going to add negative statistics to my purchase stats that are viewable by vendors though (Refund Rate%)

				No it is not a refund is never shows as anything as the transaction was cancelled <br /><br />Just msg the vendor a hour or two before you cancel telling them you will in xhrs&nbsp; blahblahblah so they dont claim they sent it then you canceled before they could mark it in transit

As cryngie said above, send a message to your vendor telling him that you are going to cancel your order. Seeing a vendor not responding for some days can be strange or very simple something happens to his personal life. If you can find another vendor then cancel your order. I myself have been in your place couple of times but I prefer to wait some days because you never know why the vendor is away and usually waiting pays off. <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Adamiz
