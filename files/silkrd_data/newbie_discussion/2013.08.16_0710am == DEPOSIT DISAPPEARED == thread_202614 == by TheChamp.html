				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t stress, deposits can take a long time unfortunately. This is partly due to SR security precautions, they tumble all the coins coming in and going out. I&#039;ve waited longer than 6 hours, on rare occasions 24+. Usually support requests you wait at least 12 hours before contacting them about slow withdrawals/deposits. Fear not, though, I&#039;ve heard of lots of people waiting ages, myself included, but I&#039;ve never heard of SR losing anyone&#039;s coins. They always come through eventually.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Just make sure you sent them to the correct wallet address. If you copy pasted then you&#039;re fine, just got to wait it out :(

				yep they are credited to my silkroad account. Looks like there is honour amongst pirates.<br />Took a few hours, so maybe not a bad idea to warn new guys like me on the deposit link .<br />I had assumed I was ripped off and said to myself-lesson learnt, buy my drugs through the usual blackmarket.<br />But alls well that ends well.<br />Good luck to the other guys with the same issues.<br />

Each Confirmation takes 8-12 minutes, so about an hour in most cases.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard of it taking upwards of 20+ confirmations for people&#039;s SR accounts to be credited with the funds. You can simply check the blockchain address you applied the credit to(the address you deposited to) via https://blockchain.info&nbsp; and it will tell you how many Confirmations it has, and how much money was credited to that address from your deposit.&nbsp; <br /><br />:P&nbsp;

				It has never been &quot;instant&quot;.<br /><br />There usually has to be at least 7 or 8 conformations on the blockchain before it shows up.

				congrats on your BTC! =)<br /><br />However depositing here was just the start, remember to always look from whom you buy and see their feedback. Also make sure to first spam to 50 posts before you buy something in order to report a scammer in the correct forum..

				So glad I found this thread. Though I haven&#039;t experienced what the OP has, I am about to perform the same transaction and would have been very worried if I hadn&#039;t found this. So, thank you folks for posting and helping out another noob.
