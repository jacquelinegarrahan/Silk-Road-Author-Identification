				The seller &#039;MR Money&#039; has 94 feedback rating and many successful transactions, but he has asked me to finalize before he dispatches. Most of his feedback is drugs, but now he is only selling hardware.<br /><br />Since I&#039;m new here, I presume FE stands for finalize early, am I right? I thought it meant &#039;full escrow&#039;.<br /><br />Anyway, much of his recent feedback has been for preorders of Butterfly Labs hardware, and all these people have finalized early and given good feedback. These devices are rather pricey, so the buyers seem to be taking quite a risk. He has also sold older BFL devices which have been delivered and have good feedback. Also, for the laptop I ordered, the image doesn&#039;t match with the model the listing says (and he only sells this laptop model, so it isn&#039;t a simple mix up).<br /><br />Actually, the last feedback from someone who has received their order was 12 days ago, with 16 feedbacks of early finalisers since that one (including the aforementioned preorders which he probably wouldn&#039;t have received yet, but also including recent orders of the &#039;BFL singles&#039; which he already possesses). I genuinely suspect he has either bought this account (or hacked it), or decided to wind up his operation and give himself a golden handshake as it were.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/06b4755b22<br /><br />Does anyone have opinions? I sent him a message explaining my concerns, and I hope he will reconsider his demand for early finalizing.

				not been on forums long but been kicking around silkroad for a bit. To answer you question yes it means finalize early. most people would say never finalize early but i&#039;v had to take the gamble a few times but that&#039;s me iv always took risks and most of the time it pays off but iv also been scammed a few times. it all comes down to you and how you fell if he seems legit and all his feedback is good why not give him a mail for some to see he could put your mind at rest. and if not walk away.

				I just reported him. I believe he has made fake feedback reporting delivery of BFL singles, when in fact only 1 (actually, not sure about that one) out of about 20 feedback of the listing report delivery. The rest are still waiting after up to 14 days. And that&#039;s not even getting to the preorders, which no doubt no-one will see.

				You know, some vendors have policies like, FE for newbs or FE for outside USA or EU. You&#039;ll see it all the time and here&#039;s how it works.<br /><br />The vendor is taking the majority of the risks in this transaction. You can deny a package sent to you—you could also send anyone anything, right?<br /><br />So much of this is built on trust and respect. This is the BM remember. That&#039;s how it is. Like &quot;Street &#039;cred&quot; or whatever. It&#039;s all the same.<br /><br />FYI: you can always CHANGE your feedback. For example, you are told to FE for an order before it&#039;s sent &#039;cause you&#039;re a newbie. You do and are told to leave a 5/5. If your package never arrives, message the vendor. If you hear nothing, you can change your feedback and their rating falls and falls. Eventually, vendors that aren&#039;t credible do get dropped you know…<br /><br />Just so you know! I&#039;ve FEd a couple times now. And now there&#039;s also a mutual trust between vendor and buyer. Dig?<br /><br />SRG

				One more thing:<br /><br />Being the basis of the whole being of the Silk Road, the SR wants your confidence also. You can message DPR or the SR staff. The will often FORCE a vendor to transfer you some sort of refund. I&#039;ve even heard of SR covering the refund themselves. I love the road…<br /><br />SRG<br /><br />—lookin&#039; good

				The laptop he was selling he has now admitted wasn&#039;t the model he said it was, rather than the X230, it was a E535 (worth much less). I&#039;ve told him I don&#039;t want it.<br /><br />Anyway, regarding the FE, it wasn&#039;t just me , in fact he told me &quot;it isn&#039;t personal&quot;. All his items have a policy of FE, including the preorders I was talking about. I his feedback definately has people saying they got their &#039;singles&#039;, but when you look at the singles listing, all the feedback there is people still waiting for them after FEing. Right back to 15 days ago, many of these people saying they will update when the item arrives (none have done so yet). For example<br /><br />&quot;I FE&#039;d, but seller has refused to provide tracking after making 3 promises even before DDOS attacks started. It&#039;s been 10 days and no tracking and no product.&quot;<br /><br />My judgement is that he is a scammer. Where are all his drugs listing gone? He doesn&#039;t even mention them in this profile page, even though most of his feedback has been build from those sales. I&#039;ve seen Silkroad profiles with good feedback on sale.

				It seems to be that this seller has finally been rumbled with help from my reporting http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/06b4755b22/<br /><br />What did I say about a plan coming together?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m still devastated that he was able to scam so much before this happened. From my quick calculations based on numbers of legitimate feedback and current prices when I looked a few hours ago, it totals around 48BTC, that&#039;s over $6000. I think they were all charmed by his &#039;good communication&#039;, though mainly his huge positive feedback which was clearly from the previous account owner.
