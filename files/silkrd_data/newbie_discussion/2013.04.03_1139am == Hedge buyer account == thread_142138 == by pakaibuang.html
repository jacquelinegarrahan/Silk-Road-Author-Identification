				I think SR should give option for buyer to hedge their account to usd. I&#039;m scared shitless that a few week ahead, bitcoin value will depreciate and we will see increase in price in bitcoin for stuff sells here. I cant buy any shit in SR now because of several reason.&nbsp; anyone think this is a good idea?

				I would love for that to happen. Unfortunately, it probably exposes SR capital to too much volatility.

				what i mean is, if i transfer 50usd worth of bitcoin into SR. it will stay 50 usd. and i like that to happen because it is more stable for the buyer.&nbsp; why is that bad for SR capital?

				If BTC crashes, then SR would have to provide its users with more BitCoins in order to maintain the value of their accounts. This would open up their capital reserves to a large amount of volatility. I mean, the compensation for lost value has to come from somewhere. If SR hedges its buyers accounts, then SR has to pay for it when a crash comes. The only way to really make it worthwhile would be to charge a very large premium for the service.

				I don&#039;t understand the rants in reply to a reasonable question ...<br />My understanding of the question is why not allow users to have a USD balance as well as a BTC balance.<br />Give users the option of converting BTC to USD at whatever the prevailing rate is, in a similar fashion to that used by hedged orders.<br /><br />If this can be done for vendors why not for buyers ?<br /><br />In fact this sounds like a decent business opportunity for DPR !

				Smokecrack ... Nothing wrong with my genes<br /><br />When I make a hedged purchase my bit coins ARE converted to USD ... Nothing to do with vendors having BTC<br />Which is why a refund after a failed transaction may result in fewer BTC being returned than the original amount.<br />SR do not have a BTC exposure and do in fact charge a commission which is borne by the vendor on successful completion.<br /><br />Please feel free to correct me ... No need to cast aspersions on my genetic background unless you are feeling really insecure about yourself !
