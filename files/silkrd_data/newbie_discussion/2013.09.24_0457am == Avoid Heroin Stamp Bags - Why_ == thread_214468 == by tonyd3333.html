				I&#039;ve noticed a few people say that heroin stamp bags should be avoided, and I&#039;m wondering what the reason is? I&#039;d assume it&#039;s just because you aren&#039;t getting as much product for your buck this way, as compared to buying a gram or more... But is there a quality issue some people have come across with stamp bags? Seems to me that it&#039;s standard #3 or #4, or whatever is described usually, and sells for roughly what a tenth of a gram should sell for... No? <br /><br />I guess these &quot;stamp bags&quot; are an East coast thing mostly, and I&#039;d never heard of them until I saw them on SR... on the West coast, we do balloons for a quarter gram usually, and it&#039;s BTH 99% of the time when you ask for a &quot;balloon&quot;. At least in my experience.

				I&#039;ve never heard of balloons. Good to know. And yeah from my experience, stamp bags are generally not as good in terms of quality. Honestly it&#039;s pretty much all I&#039;d be able to afford to deal with. It does the job but you get what you pay for. There are decent stamps out there, but if I had the BTC I&#039;d definitely go with BTH/deal in grams.

I don&#039;t ever weight my stuff out, I just go by instinct... Probably not good to advertise that bit publicly since my username here is the same as on SR... haha. But yes, if I remember right, they are supposed to be around 50mg. Enough for one decent &quot;round&quot;.

Balloons is pretty much the only universal term used where I come from when discussing heroin. That, and &quot;black&quot;. Nobody calls it &quot;gear&quot; or &quot;dope&quot; here. It&#039;s either &quot;black&quot; or &quot;baloons&quot;... And a balloon is exactly what it sounds like, it&#039;s a piece of rubber balloon wrapped around a ball of BTH that&#039;s wrapped in wax paper. <br /><br />Anyways, if you ever go to Phoenix, Vegas, and probably a good chunk of California, those are the terms you&#039;ll hear the local users saying... <br /><br />Now you know! ;)<br /><br />And I agree, dealing in any form of heroin, half a gram is the lowest amount I&quot;ll mess with. Too many quality issues with small amounts, and the prices are astronomical when you buy in smaller batches. Just received my first order of stamps in the mail, and I won&#039;t be ordering those again. Half gram or nothing, in my opinion.

				Twenty stamps to a gram so yeah 50mgs.&nbsp; I think you were told to avoid them because if you buy it by the g you are getting a much better price typically.&nbsp; Stamps are almost always guaranteed to be street level cut up shit too as it is obviously meant for the end user not another distributor.&nbsp; However there are exceptions to every rule and I would take a stamp bag over some nasty tar any day.
