				Hey guys, I&#039;m new here on the forums, but I&#039;ve been around the road for over a year now. Why is THC acetate not available as a product for purchase? BHO is available, and someone has the capabilities, why is no one making It and selling it for $250 a gram or whatever the fuck? <br /><br />THC Acetate is talked about in DEA writings as well as other sources, and for those unfamiliar it is the same process that turns morphine into heroin. From my limited chemical knowledge, considering the sheer number of people on here and the resources some of them must possess, why is this stuff of legends just that - still a legend?<br /><br />I want to fucking smoke some.<br /><br />-Badgerz

				Acetic anhydride is a List I chemical. Fairly difficult to obtain.<br />THC is not super easy and super cheap to purify from hash oil.<br />Too few reports about THC acetate&#039;s effects. Most drug chemists probably don&#039;t know anything about it.<br />Hash oil and bud are cheap enough. The market demands them, but not THC acetate.<br /><br />Why aren&#039;t you making it and selling it for $250 a gram or whatever the fuck?

				I hadn&#039;t actually heard about this until now, very interesting. From a quick read it seems to be quite difficult and volatile to produce with very little documentation regarding the effects, you&#039;d also need a pretty decent lab set up to produce it.<br /><br />I can&#039;t find anything regarding potential medicinal uses and I would assume that many beneficial cannabinoids, alkaloids and terpenes are lost through the chemical process. In which case, it&#039;d be far more cost effective for both vendors and buyers to stick with properly purged BHO type concentrates, and choose other drugs such as mushrooms or lsd if more psychedelic effects are desired.<br /><br />Thanks for teaching me something new, though!<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf
