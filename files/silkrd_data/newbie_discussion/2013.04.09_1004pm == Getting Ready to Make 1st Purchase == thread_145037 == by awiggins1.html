				Hello all!<br />New user here and I&#039;m getting ready to make my 1st SR purchase. Being a newbie, I was wondering if I should clear anything on my computer before I start. I&#039;ve looked at SR on my normal browser using the onion.to extension, so I want to be sure nothing can be traced. I know there is a miniscule chance I will be caught, especially since I will be using a different username than the one I logged in with on my browser, but you can never be too careful. So any tips are welcome.<br />Thanks

Don&#039;t use onion.to if you think it&#039;s risky.

				I wouldn&#039;t bother. It&#039;s not illegal to look at SR and having it in your history through a public browser isn&#039;t evidence. Clear your history and such, but they&#039;re not going to get forensic on your HD to figure out you visited SR a few times via the clearnet.<br /><br />In general it&#039;s a good idea to keep your receiving location clean of all SR/drug stuff, but I&#039;m sure loads of people violate that all the time (you can&#039;t tell me *everyone* buying weed here doesn&#039;t have some weed and a pipe/papers in the house)

				I think you should be ok. As a buyer, the amount of resources required to back-trace your IP address through the onion network means it&#039;s not worth LEs effort.<br /><br />If you want to go super stealth you can do things like buy a &#039;burner&#039; laptop &amp; only log in from internet connections away from your house (coffee shops etc) but IMO that&#039;s overkill unless you&#039;re vending. Just don&#039;t view regular (&quot;clearnet&quot;) sites through ToR as it makes it very slightly easier to trace you &amp; there&#039;s no reason to.

				Also, forgot to ask this originally, is there some sort of Tor-based email service? Because I don&#039;t want to use any email service that regular Internet has to offer if I ever need to use an email for SR-related services. And anyone have any idea what&#039;s going on with the search on SR or any idea when it will be back up?

Your IP is still hidden. <br /><br />That being said, if someone on TOR gives you a clearnet link, ONLY open it in TOR, otherwise they can correlate the two events.

				If your on SR then you are hidden, as long as you dont send any sensitive info unencrypted or log onto any personal accounts on the same platform you are using. And keep any deliveries to your house to a minimum personal amount. I have made over 10 successful transactions now. It is fun :)

				I&#039;ve made over 20 transactions here without issue. 1 transaction was bad because they sent me fake product and i made the mistake of not posting a negative review out of fear of being labeled a liar myself. I recommend you post accurate reviews regardless and get your post count to 50 so that you can post in the rumor mill. I have not learned or used PGP encryption yet but i think i a going to. I understand that makes things safer for you when putting in your address. Also the key to everything here is mass amounts of research. Find other reputable members and even pm them for help or suggestions on good vendors. Click on a vendor page on &quot;become a fan&quot; also to make a shortcut to them on your SR homepage for easier referencing too.

				Made my first order earlier and have to echo what was said about PGP. It takes ten minutes to learn, so there isn&#039;t any excuse not to use it really!
