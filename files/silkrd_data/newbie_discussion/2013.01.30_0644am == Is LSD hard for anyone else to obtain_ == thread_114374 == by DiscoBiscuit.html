				I live somewhere in the US, and frankly I just don&#039;t understand why LSD isn&#039;t more prevalent. I&#039;m no chemist or an expert, but when the stuff is made, is it not made in relatively large batches? I feel like 8/10 times the shit around where i live isnt even cid (either it&#039;s really weak or just something else entirely). <br /><br />Basically, I need more posts, and I wanted to bitch about the lack of LSD. Even on the Road, LSD isn&#039;t all too popular (or cheap, for that matter). Look at how many listings there are for LSD compared to other psychs......... what happened to the Granddaddy of pyschedelics? WHAT HAPPENED TO LUCY!!!?? <br /><br />haha

				Yea I feel ya man, it&#039;s amazing when you get your hands on it but I&#039;ve only tripped on LSD about 4 times in my life. And that&#039;s saying something, since I&#039;ve literally tripped on some sort of psychedelic an estimated total of about 300-500 times. Yea it&#039;s a big range, but you kind of lose track when you do it that many times, and you take into consideration that my first trip was only 4 years ago. Throw in (sometimes constant) use of a lot of other types of drugs, especially ones that fuck with memory, and that&#039;s why I&#039;m not quite sure. Hell it could even be a much bigger number. ANYWAYS, the point is that LSD is literally the only important drug I&#039;ve done that I can count the times I&#039;ve done it on one hand.<br /><br />I think a lot of the problem is the profit margins for most dealers, not to mention selling LSD these days is a lot less about &quot;spreading the love&quot; than it was in the past. For example, my mother told me that when she was young, which was right about the time that cocaine started to be widely available on the black market, an eight ball used to cost something like $20, and it was PURE! These days you&#039;re lucky to get any cocaine at all and have to pay at least $50 a gram. Same kind of thing with acid. What you get is expensive, even when you buy bulk, and usually not even that potent. My first acid experience was with stuff so weak that my friend gave me 6 &quot;hits&quot; for free because he thought it was probably fake. I took all 6 and barely felt anything at all (until I smoked some salvia, and what an experience that was!) <br /><br />Especially with the RC market these days. Someone can easily go online and buy like 10 grams of NBOMe&#039;s for like $500 or even less sometimes, lay it onto blotter to make 10,000 to 15,000 hits, and still sell them for 15-20 bucks a tab on the streets. That many hits of LSD would probably cost at least 10 grand, even if you had good connections. If you were just in it for the money, what would you do?

				Yeah I getchya on the $$$$ part haha. But damn, you&#039;d figure there&#039;s someone in the US who&#039;d be willing to supply the country some quality LSD. While my trip-count isn&#039;t quiet 300 (still, i&#039;m over 100 for sure), I can also say that acid is something I&#039;ve had a very limited number of times. And even some of those, I can&#039;t be positive that what I had was acid ( :( shit like that should never be an issue. ever.). <br /><br />I&#039;ve honestly only had one BALLS TO THE WALL trip on lsd, and that trip very well could have been stimulated/enhanced to the max due to my environment (first music festival ever, I quiet literally stumbled upon Big Gigantic&#039;s show, who are now my favorite dubstep artists ever... just listen to that saxophone!).<br /><br />It&#039;s unbelievable how cheap the RCs are compared to LSD. 2ce and 25i are the main two I&#039;ve dealt with, and I must say I rather enjoy them :)&nbsp; .... still want more lsd though lol

				There are still legit families producing quality stuff out on the west coast.&nbsp; I can surely attest to that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of the quality and quantity left us after the big Pickard bust in 2000.<br /><br />It&#039;s there you just have to have the right mindset when searching for it.

				Yea man, this is why I love SR so much. Pretty much anything is available here, and prices are naturally competitive. Plus, if a vendor is selling something that isn&#039;t what he says it is, someone is gonna end up reagent testing is and finding out. So illegitimate vendors don&#039;t do too well on here, which is awesome.<br /><br />I actually do thoroughly enjoy a lot of&nbsp; &quot;RC&#039;s&quot; out there, mainly the now illegal 2C&#039;s (United States, some places they&#039;re still legal). They are fun and some even better for some situations than acid, but what I absolutely crave is some good ol&#039; LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually probably gonna buy a ten strip in a couple days when I have some extra cash. 10 hits for about $80? Hell yea! Even if I have to take two hits to trip properly it&#039;s definitely better than anything I&#039;ve gotten in the past. And more than I&#039;ve ever had in my life too lol&nbsp; ;D

				LSD is just too difficult/dangerous to make. I&#039;ve never personally done an LSD cook, but I&#039;ve researched it extensively and it is not a simple process. The 2C research chemicals are much (I can&#039;t say much with enough emphasis) easier to both source precursors and then produce. You might find a few straggling chemists who stick to LSD manufacture out of tradition. Unless the chemist has a person connection or motivation to cook LSD, why take the riskier more difficult road? The 2C compounds are (probably) going to net much larger profits because of the ease of manufacturing. You might be able to make a ton of LSD in a single cook, but I feel like even a single cook is going to attract a lot of attention from LE. Far more than cooking a 2C anyways.<br /><br />It sucks, but not many people with the knowledge and access to LSD precursors are going to risk federal prison to relive a past that doesn&#039;t exist anymore. I wish I had been of age during the era of LSD, but it&#039;s gone now and I don&#039;t think anything is going to bring it back. Not even all the LSD in the world would change our culture back to what it was when LSD was king.

				When I was in high school you could get LSD anywhere and anytime you needed it. Seemed like every shady character had a vial ready to drop some lucy on whatever foodstuffs you had on you. Then in 2000 William Leonard Pickard got busted and everything went away all at once, never to be seen again in these parts. I&#039;ve been trying to score ever since, over 10 years of hoping and wishing. Then comes Silk Road and BAM! LSD for everyone! SO grateful.

				Yea I was getting tired of not being able to find a reliable source...and ended up finding about the silk road.&nbsp; I hope with time, the LSD market will grow and become more dependable.&nbsp; All it takes is those few who aren&#039;t in it for the money and know the potential of having a worldwide distribution network for clean acid.&nbsp; It won&#039;t solve all the problems in the world...but I feel that with most people, acid changes a person for the better and the more people that have this experience will help continually nudge humans toward a positive, more compassionate direction.&nbsp; Then again, there is always that line that people cross who just want to get high and are still assholes either way.&nbsp; So idk. but yea lsd is hard to obtain lol, especially when a lot of people pass off rcs as acid.&nbsp; Ecstasy is beyond popular with most people my age so there is not a lot of money to be made with the &quot;masses&quot; when it comes to acid.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />edit:Disco Biscuit! First time I dropped acid was at one of their shows...good times!&nbsp; I am assuming you named your handle after the band....not the drug slang lol

I disagree - if you think of how long an acid trip lasts (8 - 12 hours, sometimes more), it is pretty cheap compared to the cost of how much MDMA or alcohol you would need to use to stay high or drunk for the same period of time. Acid is always worth the money in my opinion :)

				The great LSD families of the USA have either scaled down their production or distribution significantly with the end of the greatful dead tours and phish tours in addition to the UNGODLY amount of people passing off unlaid blotter or RC&#039;s as &quot;family fluff&quot; or other slanderous terms misrepresenting the family. <br /><br />I feel like they&#039;re just either stockpiling lots of crystal and are about to flood the US and don&#039;t want an operational lab at the time of the distribution or are waiting until fools that are GDF&#039;d out with 50 pins on their hat stop bunking people.<br /><br />The scene in the USA is a sad sad place, but from what I hear Canada is the place to be.

				I also had this epiphany that LSD is the hardest drug to keep stocked on the road because if you treat it like a business and always try to keep your supply equal to your demand this will maximize your profits but will keep the price high. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most acid gurus are distributing their product to spread the love and are not about the big business side of it. This means that the vendors with the fair prices sell out almost instantly. <br /><br />Yeah its a very strange balance but take some L some day and contemplate it because it&#039;s definitely not like any other drug. <br /><br />On another note if anyone has a source for an unlimited amount of LSD, they could stand to make an UNLIMITED amount of money.&nbsp; There is no vendor on the road right now that stays stocked with the fire for decent prices. <br /><br />Like someone has to have realized this and is currently setting up a lab and setting up connections for precursors and a front metal plating company and all the goods to just churn out fat batches of L specifically for the road.<br /><br />We can only dream ::)

				Man reading this thread got me thinking about how LSD was everywhere way back when I was in High School in the 80&#039;s. We used to pay 4 bucks a hit. I knew some guys who would make a road trip and pick up 2-5000 hits a weekend for .50 to a dollar each hit and turn around and sell them for 4-5 bucks each. <br /><br />Those 17 year olds made a ton of dough back then, doing 1-2 resupplies a month. They supplied half the schools in the city. Remember we&#039;re talking the 80&#039;s when a gallon of premium gas was less than a buck.

				I think its simply a supply and demand thing and it really boils down to simple economics.&nbsp; If there was a higher demand for LSD there&#039;d be more of it being produced or shipped into the country.&nbsp; As it stands, people would rather spend their money on mdma, meth, weed, coke, etc., so thats why those drugs are easier to find.

				Take a look at the original patent to Sandoz for LSD manufacture.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically a three step process, with the most &quot;complicated&quot; steps being two-phase extraction of raw ergot alkaloids (no, you don&#039;t need pure ergotamine tartrate to manufacture high quality LSD); refluxing with nitric acid followed by hydrazine; after extraction, this is followed by mix and stir with diethylamine; the last step is either precipitation with a specific tartaric acid isomer or column chromatography.<br /><br />Yes, hydrazine can be dangerous.&nbsp; The hard part is getting a hold of stuff like diethylamine and hydrazine.<br /><br />Contrary to popular myth, ergot itself isn&#039;t all that dangerous.&nbsp; You CAN hold it in bare hands without danger.&nbsp; As long as you&#039;re not dumb enough to eat it, you&#039;re fine.<br /><br />Even more modern, stereoselective LSD synthesis (such as Gabrecht, 1959) are not particularly difficult, though they still involve potentially dangerous reagents (as converting a carboxylic acid to an amide requires reactive reagents).<br /><br />LSD was first synthesized in 1938.&nbsp; The techniques involved in LSD synthesis were introduced to chemistry students taking 2nd year organic chemistry where I went to school.&nbsp; I used diethylamine in 2nd year and hydrazine in 4th year.&nbsp; A competent 3rd year student should easily be able to look up the synthesis of LSD and understand it well enough that they&#039;d feel competent carrying it out as an undergraduate lab experiment.<br /><br />Gabrecht WL. 1959. Synthesis of Amides of Lysergic Acid. J Org Chem. 24: 368 - 372.<br /><br />See, for example:<br /><br />GB patent 463936 from 1937.<br />Stoll, A. et al.&nbsp; US Patent 2809920, 1953<br />GB patent 579484. Process for preparation of Diethylamide of d-Lysergic Acid. 1943.<br /><br />The last patent is only 3 pages long.<br /><br />Why LSD seems so difficult to find and why it&#039;s so expensive is a mystery to me.&nbsp; Sure, hydrazine and diethylamine aren&#039;t the easiest things to get, but LSD is so potent that one wouldn&#039;t need much.&nbsp; I suspect that, despite the ubiquity of ergot, most &#039;field ergot&#039; is simply unsuitable for LSD manufacture due to low concentration of alkaloids.

				&quot;Yeah its a very strange balance but take some L some day and contemplate it because it&#039;s definitely not like any other drug.&quot;<br /><br />It really baffles me how people can say this because it seems very obviously to be very similar to psilocin, mescaline and even the active alkaloids in morning glory seeds.<br /><br />Yes, I do see differences between LSD and mescaline and LSD and psilocin.&nbsp; Some of the differences are obvious and some are quite subtle.&nbsp; I often wonder how much the role of expectation plays into creating these differences.&nbsp; When I see people say things like &quot;psilocin feels more natural and LSD more analytical,&quot; I think it&#039;s way more likely that one&#039;s beliefs about the differences between &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot; compounds plays far more of a role in such statements than any intrinsic differences between the drugs.<br /><br />What I&#039;d really like to see are drug discrimination studies on humans with psychedelic drugs, to see how often people might confuse LSD and psilocin or mescaline.&nbsp; Many psychedelic drug users insist that it&#039;s virtually impossible to confuse such drugs, but I remain skeptical.&nbsp; Take a look at drug discrimination studies and some of the drugs people have confused are astonishing (and people are trained to recognize one drug before getting to the second phase of the experiment where they&#039;re asked to try differentiating the training drug from the test drug or placebo - they have to be able to recognize the training drug very reliably before getting to the second phase).&nbsp; I was shocked by the results of such studies when I first saw them but once you understand how they work it&#039;s not so surprising.<br /><br />Psilocin, LSD and mescaline all have 5HT2A agonist activity.&nbsp; Yes, they have activity at other receptors and their own unique pharmacology, but their overlapping action does suggest it&#039;s possible people could confuse them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done plenty of psychedelic drugs and even though I&#039;m pretty sure I could tell LSD apart from psilocin (largely due to some really obvious differences, such as: psilocin makes me yawn a lot whereas LSD is very stimulating and the difference in duration of effect).&nbsp; However, it still seems really obvious to me that the differences in many effects are quite subtle and nebulous.&nbsp; I even suspect that if I were dosed while sleeping with either psilocin or LSD and woken during the peak, then told I have 30 minutes to properly identify which drug I&#039;ve taken that I might not be able to do so.<br /><br />Many people vehemently respond to me by telling me that I must be a moron if I think it&#039;s even possible to confuse the two, but I&#039;ve never known anyone who&#039;s seriously tried to do a double-blind experiment with willing volunteers.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be that hard to design an experiment where people are dosed with psilocin or LSD then asked to differentiate between the two.&nbsp; I suspect that most people would reliably identify either drug, but I still think there&#039;s potential for confusion (especially upto the peak - by the time the experiences are over the differences in time course would make it quite obvious).&nbsp; The only difficult part of such an experiment would be how to make it so it&#039;s not obvious which drug one had received simply based on the dosing itself and how to ensure that the conditions are double blind.<br /><br />I do recall seeing some references in the scientific literature about volunteers describing the effects of LSD and psilocin being virtually identical, but the articles don&#039;t usually publish the actual descriptions of such experiments.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall ever seeing any actual drug descrimination experiments with LSD on humans but I&#039;ll check again.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />first of all I am totally new here but my main interest is in acquiring LSD.<br /><br />I have been looking over various (local) vendors and at the discussion threads on LSD.&nbsp; I have a number of comments I&#039;d like to make.<br /><br />The first thing about a number of the sellers that bothers me is the claim that their LSD is &quot;lab tested.&quot;&nbsp; I have a very, very difficult time believing such a thing.&nbsp; It would be easy to believe someone did a presumptive test, but a number of LSD vendors simply say something like &quot;200 ug LSD - lab tested.&quot;&nbsp; What kind of test was it?&nbsp; IR spectroscopy?&nbsp; Combination gc/ms (gas chromatography / mass spectrometry)?&nbsp; A presumptive test based on reagents?&nbsp; Observation of UV fluorescence?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see actual data (i.e. evidence) from the lab test because I have a very diffucult time believing such claims.&nbsp; Getting access to NMR spectroscope or a mass spectrometer is not particularly easy and even if you can get access to such a machine, you still need someone who knows how to use it.&nbsp; Being able to use an NMR spectroscope isn&#039;t uncommon, though I&#039;d be nervous about taking a sample of illegal drugs to the NMR spectroscope and risk having the spectra saved on computer, thus leaving fantastic evidence of the crime on a computer.&nbsp; <br /><br />A mass spectrometer is such a specialized piece of equipment that the majority of PhD-holding professors of chemistry don&#039;t know how to actually operate the equipment (unlike NMR, which I&#039;d expect the majority of people with BSc degrees in chemistry could operate).&nbsp; Whereas you could, conceivably sneak your sample to the NMR and wipe the data afterwards, with something like GC/MS, you&#039;d have to submit your sample to someone who actually knows how to operate the equipment.&nbsp; They might not bother trying to interpret the results, but still, you&#039;d better be able to trust them.&nbsp; <br /><br />The point is that in such cases of actual lab tests, I find it hard to accept that any vendor who actually went through the trouble of obtaining an NMR spectrum or mass spectrum of their product wouldn&#039;t post an image for all to see. Of course, that naturally leads me to wonder why a vendor wouldn&#039;t do such a thing if they did a simple presumptive test based on something like UV fluorescence or a reagent based one like that done with p-DMAB.&nbsp; If you actually did any kind of lab test, why not post the data?<br /><br />That being said, there are a few presumptive tests for LSD that buyers can make.&nbsp; The simplest is to observe UV fluorescence.&nbsp; I&#039;ll come back and post a reference to papers describing the test for those interested.&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit hesitant to mention it simply because most vendors probably have no clue what I&#039;m talking about and wouldn&#039;t know what compounds would provide false positives with UV fluorescence nor how to find such a thing out (there are advantages to being scientifically literate).&nbsp; UV fluorescence would at least tell you if your blotter has a compound with a 9,10-didehydroergoline ring present or not.<br /><br />Next, about comments by purchasers.&nbsp; I am stunned by the number of users who seem to think that they not only can tell that what they have is *definitely* LSD, how pure it may be and the quantity of it.&nbsp; I doubt any of us have actually made our own LSD or had any real physical evidence that what you took was, really and genuinely pure LSD.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t misunderstand: I believe I&#039;ve taken LSD 35 - 40 times, but admittedly that&#039;s all based on what I&#039;ve read about the experience (and the fact that my experiences were consistent with the effects reported in the literature).&nbsp; I can&#039;t say for sure that I&#039;ve taken LSD or that it was pure or what the doses were, but I am comfortable concluding I have taken LSD (though many are often confused by my own admission of skepticism).<br /><br />The only physical evidence I have is that I&#039;ve only used blotters and most of the time when I was using LSD, the potent phenethylamines weren&#039;t as commonly found as they are on blotter these days (though it&#039;s hard to get a sense of what proportion is counterfeit these days).<br /><br />I&#039;ve grown my own psilocybe cubensis (which contain psilocin); mescaline bearing cactuses are legal where I live and I&#039;ve used Morning Glory seeds numerous times. Given the relative similarity in mechanism of action of psilocin, mescaline, ergotamine / ergometrine and LSD, I&#039;m quite confident that whatever was on those blotters I used was, at the very least, a 5HT2A agonist or had 5HT2A agonist activity.<br /><br />That might seem to be a very bizarre conclusion, but it&#039;s largely based on my understanding of the drug discrimination paradigm.&nbsp; Based on my understanding of how drug discrimination works and the results of drug discrimination experiments in humans, when others claim to know they&#039;ve taken LSD, I&#039;m generally happy to assume they&#039;ve come to the correct conclusion provided they offer a few clues such as the length of the experience, a description of some of the effects, other drugs that I can probably believe they&#039;ve tried and so forth.<br /><br />However, when it comes to claims of purity, I don&#039;t believe any of those for a second.&nbsp; Largely because it relies on the belief that some kind of effect (usually an undesireable one) must be due to some adulterant or product of decomposition - even though we&#039;re talking about psychedelic drugs and nobody can really identify what adulterant or product of decomposition may be present.&nbsp; <br /><br />Plus, there really is a lot of complete gibberish on the internet about LSD synthesis.&nbsp; For example, crystal quality, colour and morphology don&#039;t necessarily tell you about the purity of your product, so all this stuff about &quot;fluff&quot; and whatnot is gibberish.&nbsp; While well formed crystals often result from a regular, pure product, the converse in not correct.&nbsp; Poorly formed crystals, even discoloured product, doesn&#039;t necessarily mean the quality is particulary poor (or poor at all).&nbsp; Ergot alkaloids can dimerize and even a 1% impurity of dimer can lead to a product which looks black (thanks to those conjugated pi systems).<br /><br />One last thing are the claims by those who say things like &quot;it&#039;s probably not 200 ug, but more like 160 ug.&quot;&nbsp; Such claims have little credibility.&nbsp; I might believe people could estimate LSD doses to within 100 or 50 ug, so maybe one could say &quot;I doubt it&#039;s 0.2 mg, but maybe 0.1 mg&quot; or similarly &quot;I doubt 0.20 mg, more like 0.15 mg&quot; though I guess I&#039;m asking too much by nitpicking over the use of significant figures. ;-P<br /><br />I really wanted to be able to add references to this post because I can back up what I&#039;ve said with published evidence.&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit too tired to do lookup and cite the journal articles now (also, experience has often shown me that many drug users don&#039;t seem to care what the scientific evidence has to say, despite the fact that you can find thousands of research articles published about the results of experiments with pure LSD - many of which are very much in line with what users of &#039;street&#039; LSD experience).&nbsp; I will come back and add references.<br /><br />Sorry for the 3 posts in a row. This was originally intended for the LSD vendor discussion but I&#039;m a newbie, plus I tend to get sucked into forums because I enjoy arguing.

Convert the hydrazide to LSD by adding the hydrazide to a solution of diethylamine.&nbsp; Extract racemic LSD and isolate d-LSD using a silica or alumina filled chromatography column.<br /><br />Please, if you don&#039;t know anything about chemistry, then don&#039;t contribute to this myth that LSD is soooooooooooo hard to synthesize.&nbsp; It was first synthesized in 1938.&nbsp; The techniques are familiar to 2nd year undergraduate students in chemistry.&nbsp; It&#039;s a relatively simple 3 step process. <br /><br />The hard part is going to be getting enough ergot and getting your hands on diethylamine and hydrazine.<br /><br />I know that people want to see LSD as being so incredibly special but the 3 common myths are hear are not true.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a PhD in chemistry to&nbsp; figure out how to make LSD.&nbsp; A 3rd year student could look it up, figure it out, understand it and be capable of carrying it out EASILY (if they had the reagents and precursors, they would have no problem manufacturing high quality LSD).&nbsp; Refluxing is just boiling under a condenser.&nbsp; Anyone can do that.&nbsp; Anyone can mix and stir.&nbsp; Column chromatography requires a bit of skill but not much.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need pure starting materials.&nbsp; You can start with a CRUDE mixture of ergot alkaloids.&nbsp; Conversion to the hydrazide of lysergic acid essentially separates a solution of pure lysergic acid hydrazide from crude alkaloids.&nbsp; You could do it with less than $1000 of lab equipment.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done synthetic organic chemistry where I tried and have synthesized compounds which nobody else had ever made before.&nbsp; That kind of thing is a bit of a trial and error process and involves some thinking.&nbsp; There are a number of published syntheses of LSD and those starting from ergot are not complicated.&nbsp; Looking up published synthesis from as long as 75 years ago and carrying them out when they&#039;re basically 3 step processes that are basically 2 phase extractions followed by adding a reagent and stirring isn&#039;t complicated.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend it to non-chemists, but ask an organic chemist to look at the patent to Sandoz or the J Org Chem reference I posted above and they&#039;ll tell you it&#039;s quite straightforward.<br /><br />The other irony is that ergot alkaloids can be considered run of the mill precursors.&nbsp; Ergot is one of the most medicinally important plants and ergot alkaloids are produced in huge quantities for the chemical industry.&nbsp; The problem comes down to obtaining them.&nbsp; These chemicals are regulated.&nbsp; A lot of chemical supply companies wouldn&#039;t sell you a bottle of purified water unless you&#039;re a registered customer.&nbsp; Good luck getting a precursor which everyone knows can be used to manufacture LSD.&nbsp; On the other hand, ergot grows around the globe and isn&#039;t all that hard to find.&nbsp; I suspect most ergot in the fields simply don&#039;t have high enough concentrations of ergot alkaloids to be practical for manufacture.&nbsp; Diethylamine is a relatively run of the mill reagent (though how you define &quot;run of the mill&quot; reagent when there are so many is a bit confusing).&nbsp; Hydrazine is probably not quite as commonly used but it&#039;s available.&nbsp; The problem is obtaining these things.<br /><br />Just because methamphetamine can be synthesized from ingredients that are relatively easy to obtain whereas the ingredients required for LSD are much more difficult to obtain doesn&#039;t mean that the chemistry involved in synthesizing LSD is complicated or difficult.&nbsp; Get it?
