				I&#039;m interested in setting up a thread where people can report the qualitative aspects of their Heroin experiences with different varieties of Heroin available from various vendors.&nbsp; In other words, when giving an account of a particular type of heroin, rather than simply stating &quot;Fire!&quot; or &quot;Powerful&quot; or &quot;put me on the nod&quot; we could describe at length, as well as possible, all the features of the experience.&nbsp; What did you like most about it?&nbsp; Was there anything you didn&#039;t like about it?&nbsp; Did it make you euphoric and happy, or sober and indrawn?&nbsp; Was the experience accompanied by physical pleasure and warmth?&nbsp; Or did it simply put you on the nod without much else.&nbsp; Was it an upper or downer primarily. What did it smell like, taste like?&nbsp; Did it&#039;s aroma give you deja-vu experiences?&nbsp; &nbsp;I am hoping that such a thread could be THE place for long reviews of particular varieties of H and where to source them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Our answer to wine reviews, but far superior!<br /><br />Let me give an example:&nbsp; I recently bought a gram of gositall&#039;s Afghanistan dope due to the excellent reviews.&nbsp; But imagine how I felt a couple days later after shelling out around $250.00 for the dope plus shipping and discovering that it had practically none of the euphoria which is one of the features that I look for in dope.&nbsp; Ditto bodily pleasure:&nbsp; I found practically no pleasureable feelings from using it.&nbsp; Little if any warmth either.&nbsp; What it did have is potency.&nbsp; I did a little too much initially and started nodding out to the point that I just went to bed and slept for 3 hours.&nbsp; I was bummed.&nbsp; I had done extensive research on gotsitall&#039;s status and everyone seemed to love his dope (and his communication; he is a rather nice fellow).&nbsp; But clearly something wasn&#039;t working if I was reading all these superlatives and I felt that the dope was missing all the qualities which I do dope to achieve!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(I understand that for now gotsitall is selling a better variety of Heroin so these complaints are not necessarily accurate currently).&nbsp; The problems are manifold, but one simple one is that most people don&#039;t describe their subjective feelings; instead they report &#039;fire&#039;, &#039;strong&#039;, deep nod, powerful, etc. which don&#039;t disclose the actual experience.&nbsp; Also some users are reluctant to talk about vendors products if they have have critical feedback they feel they need to make for the benefit of community and which ultimately would be valueable for the vendor to hear as well..&nbsp; (they don&#039;t want to anger their suppliers).&nbsp; &nbsp;So, let&#039;s strive for as detailed an experience report of whatever Heroin you will be exploring next.&nbsp; I&#039;ll offer a review of subsrgood new #4 Afghani in a couple of days, which I am told, is &#039;fire!&quot;.&nbsp; Orpheus

				The problem is that everyone will have a different experience due to tolerance and things like maintenance programs. I only use forum reviews to get a general idea of what vendors are considered the best-- then i will order from each of them until I find one I would want to continue business with.
