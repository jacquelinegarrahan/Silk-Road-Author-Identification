				Just getting familiar with the site, I added something to my cart and to complete the order, it just asks me to enter in my name/address as it would appear on a letter with a little green ? and a popup saying to check the buyers guide. There&#039;s no mention of encryption at all. Is it automatically done through the site? How safe is it to just enter my info in there without a PGP key?<br /><br />I&#039;ve had some bitcoin for close to a year now and not made a purchase, mostly because PGP might as well be Chinese to me and haven&#039;t taken to time to get familiar with it. Is it a must?

				You can put your unencrypted address in the shipping field. It will remain unencrypted.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to fool with PGP many users use privnote.com - you will create a self-destructing link that contains your address- Post the link in the address field on SR and the vendor will know what to do. <br /><br />

				get gpg4usb. preferably run it from your usb drive, although that is not necessary.<br /><br />This is inbcredibly easy to use, there are lots of senior members who will help you learn it...<br /><br />do not put your real name and address in the place where it says to do so, only send it in an encrypted message to the vendor.

				Also easy to use is &quot;portablepgp&quot;.<br />These are the steps:<br /><br />-&nbsp; install the little prog.<br />-&nbsp; copy the public pgp key from your vendor into a text file (f.e. notepad.exe)<br />-&nbsp; import to prog&nbsp; (&quot;import from file&quot;)<br />-&nbsp; klick on the key you want to use in the &quot;target&quot; field (if you imported more than 1 already)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the second field take option: &quot;No signature just encrypt&quot;<br />- type your address<br />-&nbsp; press the green arrow &quot;encrypt&quot; <br />- copy and paste the encrypted address to the address field in your order --&gt; you&#039;re done with it.<br /><br />Hth,<br />pathfinder13<br />

				<br />Also- using PGP may instill a bit more confidence in your vendors.&nbsp; At least you went that tiny extra step to be safe.
