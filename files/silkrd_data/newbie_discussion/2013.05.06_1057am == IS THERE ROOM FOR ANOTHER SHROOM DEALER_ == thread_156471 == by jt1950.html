				I see there are a lot of shroom dealers on SR.&nbsp; I wonder if trying to sell shrooms on SR would even be worth the vendor deposit.<br />If I were to do this, I suppose I would want to start out beating everyone&#039;s price?&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about good business.&nbsp; Not being on here for a couple months with two dozen sales.<br />I&#039;d like to send out at least a dozen packages a week.<br />Maybe sell at&nbsp; &nbsp;$25 a 1/4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$100 an ounce<br /><br />To come in at that price and get a decent clientele within the first month.<br />Would that be a reasonable expectation?&nbsp; <br />

				Do you see many people on Ebay asking this type of question? No, they log on, put the lowest price they can do, make a loss or break even and take it from there.<br /><br />SR is like any other online trading site, the best price and the most reliable vendors always win.<br /><br />But no, go away, I want to sell shrooms within a month too, so you are my competition&nbsp; :P

				There are some out of this world, amazing shroomers on here. Some people probably have professional mycologists growing some of this stuff. Maybe you could make a name for yourself if you managed to sell one of the lesser known psilocybes. Despite the fact that it&#039;s all just psilocin and psilocybin (which just turns into psilocin in the body anyway), I&#039;m sure a lot of people would want to buy new strains.
