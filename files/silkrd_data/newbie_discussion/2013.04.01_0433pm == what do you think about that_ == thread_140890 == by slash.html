				hi everyone<br /><br />I ve contacted a dutch&nbsp; cocaine seller recently and told him that I want to buy bulk amount without taking any risk with postal customs.<br />He told me he has a private courier that can deliver to my mailbox using his car.<br />We will of course be using escrow for this transaction.<br />He doesnt want me to FE but he said he wont give any refund as the driver is his mate and the package will be delivered 100% sure<br />So at the moment im not feeling safe about that wich is normal due to the no refund thing(what if the car get stopped by customs?wich proof do i have the package has been delivered?)<br />The vendor is open to any suggestions regarding the safety of my money and has a good rep<br />But the thing is I have no idea what kind of agreement we could make up?<br />ANY HELP will&nbsp; really be appreciate<br />thank you all<br />ps:the transaction is for 100 gram of cocaine@4000 euros<br />Im 7 hours drive away from the vendor (france)

				netherlands&gt;belgium&gt;france sorry but where would this hypothetical car encounter customs? those countries are all in the schengen borderless zone, oui? <br />if a seller will use escrow but says no refunds then that&#039;s basically the same as finalising early. and btw this seems like a really bad idea if you didn&#039;t get that from crackheads LOLLL i&#039;d steer well clear! no smart legit vendor would send his mate as opposed to using the postal system as there is so much more risk and less anonymity if you happened to be LE.

				first you said&nbsp; there is no risk for the car to encounter customs<br /><br />and then you said there is much more risk using a car than postal<br /><br />isnt that a bit paradoxical?<br /><br />anyway I didnt post this to get some moral about whats good and whats bad<br />I need a genious idea to protect my money thats it<br /><br />

				ok ignoring the fact that you&#039;re being flat out rude when i&#039;m trying to help you... i&#039;m just saying that there is no customs because there is no border control between those countries as far as i&#039;m aware in response to your worries about the car getting stopped at customs. <br />then this second part is completely unrelated but for all the vendor knows YOU could be the police, in which case why would he send someone who knows who he is to traffic drugs for him as opposed to posting them? think about it. there is no logic behind it. it just sounds like a blatant scam, i&#039;m not trying to be a dick, i&#039;m trying to save you getting scammed! if you want to do it go ahead i can&#039;t stop you but don&#039;t come crying back here when you lose all your money.

				you could&nbsp; leave a notice with a code&nbsp; on your letterbox like 496754<br />and then give the code to silkroad support and tell them that the vendor needs this code to get his money(if the vendor cant provide this code the transaction will be cancelled)<br />now obviously the vendor and silkroadsupport have to agree with that!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				hey <br /><br />your idea is good<br />Ill talk to the vendor about it and see<br />Actually if he really want to scam me there is no way he ll accept this<br /><br />as you said not too sure if silkroad accept this kind of agreement<br />but I think that they might do because of the large amount of money<br /><br />thanks for the idea belly!!
