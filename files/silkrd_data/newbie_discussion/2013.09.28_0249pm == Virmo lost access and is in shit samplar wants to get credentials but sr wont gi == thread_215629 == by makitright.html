				Virmo lost access and is in shit samplar wants to get credentials but sr wont give the credentials while he is willing to fix at least the dexamphetamine problems...<br /><br />People are also bringing down virmo. Reasonable on the one hand, but not on the other. How can they see their orders/addresses amounts etc. without access? And without a buyer getting credentials?<br /><br />He needs desposit/withdrawal wallet numbers. But those can only be seen after logging in to virmo. And that is the problem. So it&#039;s not retrievable and both virmo and the customers have to suffer all the consequences?<br /><br />Weird.<br /><br />Spam to 50 is full with messages whenever I try to post so hereby this is also to spam to 50. Sorry SR for the mess...

				Another option would be to donate money to samplar so he can buy a vendor account and deal with the problems according to SR rules. But as I remember, SR vendor accounts are really expensive now :(<br /><br />Perhaps he can give people who donate some free diazepams or whatever...<br />

				samplar is even willing to lower prices on the dexamphetamine&nbsp; 8)<br />But without a vendor account it&#039;s not allowed or safe to sell.<br /><br />Hopefully SR will realize soon that virmo did not log in for over a week, not because they love to not log in everyday and ship orders, but because they can NOT LOG IN.<br /><br />Faq states, make a new account.. samplar is pretty new and now needs to reply to questions that only virmo could answer if they could log in...<br /><br />Such a shame if virmo is off the road, with open orders.. not being able to fix anything and lost btc&#039;s as well...<br /><br />sigh...

				Yeah, I, samplar, can log in now. Shipped valiums and some extra to make up for it...<br /><br />But the vendor options are gone which makes making the fe thing impossible to fix.<br /><br />But 4 people I think I can still give what they want, and others got a 100% refund so the damage is not so big on the SR side of life...
