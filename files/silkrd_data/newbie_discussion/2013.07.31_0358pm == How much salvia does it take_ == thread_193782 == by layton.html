				Just ordered a gram of 30x salvia from FeedTheNeed. He isn&#039;t replying to his emails so I need some outside info about the product.<br />My friends and I intend to quid, but I dont know how much is necessary with this potency. Is a gram enough for three people? Is it possible to quid the extracts?

				sounds like a decent dose for the three of you. We use to get the 15x or 20x and a couple of hits was good for one person. However, if you really want to get a good experience forget the salvia and try some DMT. I tried salvia because I was trying to get to that DMT realm but I kept missing. First experience wasn&#039;t bad but other experiences were not &quot;bad&quot; but not satisfying.<br /><br />First experience: I was sitting in a room with a candle on the floor. Some shaman recordings were playing in the background. Suddenly a pressure hit me like gravity was enhanced, pushing me downwards. The room started to spin vertically and suddenly all of these eyes appears like peacock feathers. Then the candle turned into a fire and I was sitting in dirt in a tent. As things started spinning, (well, I wouldn&#039;t say &quot;spinning&quot; it was more like tilting because it didn&#039;t spin 360 degrees), everything got really weird, the music started sounding like &quot;woow, woow, woow&quot;, just sounds, nothing recognizable.. then a few minutes later everything stopped. <br /><br />DMT on the other hand, HOOOOLY SHIT. You are blasted off into another fucking dimension! I&#039;ve encountered many beings on DMT from grey aliens to elves and being of energy who communicate with you. I have to admit even though I&#039;ve done DMT for years it&#039;s still an anxious experience every single time. Just don&#039;t choke on either (salvia or DMT). The thing about short acting hallucinogens is that it&#039;s so short, if you make the mistake of coughing you muddy up the entire experience. I&#039;ve choked on DMT and OMG, it felt like I was dying. I was thrusted into the middle of an alien spacecraft with a white light shining down on me and these beings were just watching me. It was actually pretty horrifying because of the disassociation from the body. Then when I came out of it I realized I was coughing my lungs out the entire time which added to the feeling of dying since I was gasping for oxygen.

				I must say with 20x salvia, I did not have as intense trips as are often described, and I never &#039;broke through&#039; really until after a fair few trips (which left me just feeling quite mentally uncomfortable), and when I did I could not even remember the most intense part of those trips, however what I do remember was strongly visual in which I had no idea I had just smoked the salvia.&nbsp; Definitely the more you do it, the more susceptible you are to the effects of it, and it&#039;s nice because, where I live anyway, you can just nip out and get some.
