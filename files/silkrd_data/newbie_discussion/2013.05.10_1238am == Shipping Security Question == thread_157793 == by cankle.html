				Hello SR,<br /><br />I recently purchased some LSD from the EU -&gt; US.<br />I used a name of a person that had lived in my house previously, since I get <br />their mail from time to time so it seemed like a safe bet. I have previously bought 1<br />pill of MDMA using this name and it worked fine. Here&#039;s where I&#039;m worried.<br />My order was supposedly shipped almost 30 days ago by a reputable (100) vendor, and it has<br />still not arrived. I am worried about the package. The vendor is offering me a re ship but I am very nervous<br />that I might get a knock on my door now because of that last order. Are my fears justified or am<br />I just being a paranoid stoner?

				its not suggested to go that route but i know a hand full of ppl still do it. One thing id be concerned about is if the previous tenant set there mail to be forwarded.. in this case you know what happens. hopefully this is not the case tho. good luck

				...&nbsp; if the person who lived there before you filed with the post office for mail forwarding, you&#039;re fucked, as it will be sent to their new address. when did they live there?

				I don&#039;t know when they lived there but I moved in about 10 months ago. &quot;you&#039;re fucked&#039; meaning I just lost out on my drugs, or &quot;youre fucked&quot; meaning I should ditch all my stash and hope LE doesn&#039;t come knocking?<br /><br />EDIT: also my MDMA purchase using that name was made at the same time as the LSD, but since the MDMA was domestic, it was here in about a week. LSD is going on 3-4 now...&nbsp; :-\

				mail forwarding lasts for one year, but you can reapply for a dollar. by &#039;youre fucked&#039; i meant just fucked out of your drugs, there shouldnt be a way to tie you to the package.

				My next concern would be if the acid is forwarded to this person, and the person reports it to the police,<br />is there any way I could get busted for it or have my house searched? I have some growing supplies and if I got busted with those it would be jail time for me, so I would obviously find a place to hide them or just trash them if need be

				It&#039;s also possible that they realize something was amiss since when previous tenants receive mail, it&#039;s not usually in the form of a personal shipment / parcel.&nbsp; Usually, the mail for previous tenants consists of junk mail, previous subscriptions, bills, etc. - so when a priority mail or whatever other shipping service has a package addressed to the previous tenants, it&#039;s a bit sketchy looking.&nbsp; It&#039;s much better simply to use your real name and address.&nbsp; What you&#039;re trying to do is make the package look as normal and boring as possible so it doesn&#039;t stand out.&nbsp; Ordering with your real name and address ALSO provides you the benefit of plausible deniability because anyone can order drugs and have them shipped to you.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little harder to argue when it&#039;s in the form of a random package addressed to the previous tenant!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, most vendors will not agree to reship or refund UNLESS you have used your correct information - including your real name and real address.

				I guess ordering from the same vendor but having it re shipped under my name would be insanely risky?

				Id just write it off as a loss and re-order with your real name.
