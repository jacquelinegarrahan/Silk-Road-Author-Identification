				So I&#039;m hopelessly frustrated with wrapping my head around the buying and transferring process of BTC and maybe some other newbies are too so here goes. I signed up for Mt.Gox and Dwolla but I&#039;m not giving them all that crushing info. A bank of America is about 20mins from me and I want to do this safely. Never used moneygram before, wouldn&#039;t even know where to start. <br /><br />So what do you use? What&#039;s safe and the process? I assume no one bothers using their bank account to buy BTC. Is that safe to do?What about the wallet thing? Or your real identity?

				I actually bought some bitcoins for the first time today. Since you have a BoA relatively close to you I recommend using bitfloor. I used it today, All they ask is for an email, you then type in how much USD you wan to deposit and they give you the info to fill out a deposit slip. Didn&#039;t ask for an ID at BoA and the money was in my account really quickly

				Listen buddy here&#039;s what I do very easy. Blockchain.info for your wallet to be anonymous so you don&#039;t just transfer to sr or anywhere like that. And maybe use bitinstant, moneygram is so simple! It&#039;s cash to btc wallet withing hours. Try those. I would never give them all that super info ill go far as my bank account

				Bitfloor doesn&#039;t ask for any info either, you just deposit cash into the account Bitfloor gives you, they never get so much as your name

				This is kind of off topic but I was trying to pm a vendor for btc exchange and it looks like my messages have been unread for the past 5 days. If I delete the message, will it be like i never sent the message in the first place? Will he never see the unread message?
