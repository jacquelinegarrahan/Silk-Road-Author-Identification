				The original news is here for those of you who understand Finnish (CLEARWEB): http://www.aamulehti.fi/Kotimaa/1194792831049/artikkeli/mustanaamion+huumetilauksille+piste+poste+restanten+kaytto+vaatii+pian+oikean+nimen.html<br /><br />Translation of the article follows.<br /><br />The Phantom&#039;s drug orders are coming to an end - poste restante soon requires a real name<br /><br />During this spring Itella [Finland&#039;s postal service]&nbsp; will quit it&#039;s anonymous poste restante -service, for the use of the service for criminal intentions has skyrocketed.<br /><br />- The customer will have to provide a real name and an ID when they pick up an order, says Itella&#039;s security- and risk management executive Markku Rajamäki.<br /><br />Until now anyone could have sent poste restante mail, take for example to the address The Phantom, poste restante, 33100 Tampere. The letter can then be collected from Tampere&#039;s main postal office by anyone just by saying they came to get The Phantom&#039;s mail. If the delivery in question is a letter, no ID is required.<br /><br />Customs&#039; crime prevention executive Hannu Sinkkonen says that poste restante mail is the number one problem in crime prevention in customs. It is very usual that a drug user or a dealer orders illict substances from abroad using poste restante.<br /><br />Besides The Phantom, customs has come across many peculiar poste restante -nicknames, that have been used when ordering drugs. Sinkkonen remembers nicknames such as Tsar the Great, Machinery Fan [as in the thing that blows air], Albino Polar Bear and Mopedboy 15. It is not rare to use another person&#039;s name either. Even the president Sauli Niinistö&#039;s name has been used in poste restante according to Sinkkonen.<br /><br />The postal service has not advertised the possibility of using poste restante anonymously. However there are a lot of drug-related Internet forums that advise how to use poste restante. One can also find information on this in Wikipedia.<br /><br />Poste restante is used legally by thousands of finns. Poste restante will continue to function so that the arrival of a delivery will not cause a notice to be sent to the customer&#039;s home address.<br /><br />End of article.<br /><br /><br />I must say that it was almost too easy for us to get drugs until now :P<br /><br />P.S. I would have posted this to Shipping, but apparently I don&#039;t have enough posts to do that.

				I would&#039;ve never wanted to use that anyway, you could still be seen on Camera walking into the post office and picking up the package.

				First post to forum!<br /><br />You can order in anyone mailbox, just wait postman and collect your letter after he go and before real owner comes. Restante has been great, but outside streets are no cameras.
