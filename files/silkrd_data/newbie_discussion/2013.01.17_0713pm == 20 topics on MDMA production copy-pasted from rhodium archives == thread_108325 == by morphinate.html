				yeah for sure. The one tricky bit is the sassafras oil. The price on silk road is insane. You could make it yourself in theory, but I&#039;m not sure what would be involved with that.

				The price of meth on SR really confuses me. It&#039;s so cheap and easy to make and people are paying 100/g? <br /><br />I actually considered selling it myself here, but I have no interest in trying meth and I wouldn&#039;t want to sell a product without testing it first.
