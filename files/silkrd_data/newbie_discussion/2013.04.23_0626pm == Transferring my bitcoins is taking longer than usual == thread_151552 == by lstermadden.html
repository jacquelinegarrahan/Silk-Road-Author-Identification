				Hey guys, I have been using the road for going on 4 months now. Today I needed to get an order in by the end of the day, so I did a cash deposit using moneygram with bitinstant. After some other precautions I transferred my coins to my SR account. <br /><br />So the moment I clicked Send to my SR account, was about 9:45 AM EST.&nbsp; The process usually takes 2 hours give or take before the coins appear in my account. It is now 2:30 pm EST.. That is 4 and a half hours and still no coins..<br /><br />Anyone else getting a longer transfer time today? or am i the only one.<br /><br />FYI I used bitinstant and did a Cash deposit ---&gt;&gt;&gt; Bitcoin Address Option.

				Chill, and all will be well. If you&#039;ve been on 4 months and paying attention to these forums, then you will have noticed a steady flow of posts where people freak out because of a few hour delay in bitcoin transfers. The system is fucked up and overloaded (and by &#039;system&#039; I think we could safely be talking about either SR or the BTC system).&nbsp; Sucks if you need to get an order in, but based on my experience this morning, getting an order in today is a challenge with or without bitcoins already in your account.<br /><br />Eventually everything will smooth out, and it&#039;s still better than the street.

				Go to blockchain.info and put your SR address into the search field ... if Bitinstant has sent the coins, it should show up on blockchain.info.

				... Lol @ Godness420... Dude YOU need to chill out, I&#039;ve probably put more money through the road then you have ever earned in your lifetime.<br /><br />I am not paranoid, I know my coins will get there, it has everytime before this. As you can see, I only have 20 posts, which means that I DO NOT come on here and bitch when anything and everything takes a little longer then it should. Anyone that has been constantly ordering twice a week for months off silkroad I think is a little past the &#039;paranoid&#039; stage.<br /><br />So THANK YOU scout, I really didn&#039;t know you can follow the coin trail through blockchain. I guess it should be coming any minute now.<br /><br />And cantharidin, things have changed a lot since you came on in the morning. It was slow earlier, but then it was running smoothly, then silkroad had to go down for a short maintenance and then it is back up. <br /><br />All I need is my coins and then I can click &#039;Check Out&#039;, I already put my items into my cart, got my privnote link for my addy, and then boom, order complete. <br /><br />So thanks to you guys for being really disrespectful, I had an honest question, and scout, thank you, for giving me an answer without calling names.

				No problem!&nbsp; I take it you were able to verify on blockchain.info that Bitinstant has indeed sent the coins to the address you gave them?&nbsp; If so, then it&#039;s just a matter of waiting for the transaction to go through on SR&#039;s end.&nbsp; As mentioned, if you don&#039;t see them in 12 hours or so, send a message to SR Support here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/help<br /><br />^^ at the bottom of that page, there is a link to send them a message.&nbsp; :)

You come on the newbie forum and start a total newbieish thread and you got more respect than you deserve. If you&#039;ve been ordering twice week for months, then this can&#039;t be the first time your bitcoins have been delayed for a few hours. Can&#039;t be.&nbsp; Are you totally unaware of the issues Bitinstant&#039;s been having since the big run-up? You admit that you&#039;ve followed the ups and downs of SR today, so I don&#039;t really understand why you&#039;d be surprised that your coins didn&#039;t show up in a flash.

				who are you to say that there is NO WAY that over the course of 4 months of using silk road that my transfer has ever taken more then two hours to transfer?<br /><br />As a matter of fact, EVERY time I transferred coins to the road, I can time it to almost exactly 2 hours on the dot. <br /><br />FYI I got my coins by the end of the night. But I sent a second round of coins in yesterday afternoon and they have yet hit my account and its 2:15 EST. Thankfully my preferred vender is the man and was able to get my order out.<br /><br />You know why I posted a thread in the newbie discussion? cause i never &quot;SPAMMED TO 50&quot;, yea crucify me for still having under 50 posts but being legitimate about it.<br /><br />This thread is CLOSED.
