				I mean, to each his own as an adult, but i worry and try to be careful about what i say because it&#039;s highly likely that there are literally kids looking through these forums it seems. I don&#039;t wanna contribute to helping a kid learn about how to do drugs. Not even with the tiniest bit of info. I&#039;d feel bad if i knew something like that. Really bad. Anybody else have thoughts on that? All are welcome. Thanks

				Well, just my opinion, but if a kid was gonna do drugs I&#039;d rather they have the info to do them safely or at least give them a better idea whether they should do a certain drug or not. If the kid realizes how addictive substances like opiates are then maybe they&#039;d avoid taking them. Having the information at least gives them a more informed decision. On the other hand we just have to hope that the kids are smart enough to research before doing anything too stupid. I worry about the same thing you&#039;re worrying about but it&#039;s really not on us to stop them, it&#039;s their parents duty. Unfortunately many parents don&#039;t talk about those types of things with their kids.

				much more worried about the same kids buying from street dealers without a detailed review system letting them know exactly what it is that they&#039;re buying and alerting them when it isn&#039;t. that&#039;s how people die when they get sold shit like PMA like I did once. I&#039;m an experienced user of MDMA, I tasted it before buying and they even fooled me, it tastes very similar to MDMA but more sour than bitter and more numbing. Even after taking it I didn&#039;t realize what it was until much later. I could be dead if I&#039;d had any real MDMA at the time and I was 27 and very experienced with drugs. Thank you prohibition. Sometimes they MIX the two together in the perfect death pill so that you&#039;d never know even with a test kit:<br /><br />Fake ecstasy pills claim TWENTIETH victim as teenager Demi Campbell dies<br />http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/green-rolex-fake-ecstasy-pills-2043831<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fake ecstasy pills flooding the UK have killed a 20th young victim.<br /><br />Demi Campbell, 18, died after taking the pills, called Green Rolex, at a house party on Monday night.<br /><br />She was the seventh death in Scotland linked to the drugs over the past two months.<br /><br />It is also feared another eight youngsters have died over the past month after taking the rogue pills in Northern Ireland.<br /><br />Another batch of fake ecstasy, known as Dr Death, killed five young people in Merseyside and Derbyshire in England.<br /><br />Yesterday police warned 80,000 fans heading for this weekend’s T in the Park music festival near Perth to beware of the green pills which have a distinctive Rolex crown stamped on them.<br /><br />And in Northern Ireland, there are fears that Loyalist paramilitaries are trafficking the pills that have caused the spate of deaths.<br /><br />Pastor Paul Burns, who knew one of the victims, called on police to act.<br /><br />He said: “These people are selling death and lining their pockets. I would call on community leaders to get this stuff off the street.<br /><br />“We don’t want to see any more young people dying.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, Demi’s mum Anne-Marie and brother Lorne, 21, and sister Chloe, 14, were being comforted by family at their home in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire.<br /><br />Her devastated uncle, David McChesney, said: “You can’t stop kids being kids and they always think they are invincible but I’d like to think that Demi’s death will make a difference.<br /><br />&quot;She was just your average teenager – a very outgoing, happy and friendly girl who was enjoying her life.<br /><br />&quot;This has destroyed the family. Everyone should learn from what has happened.”<br /><br />Supt Grahame Clarke, from Police Scotland said: “Public warnings have been issued recently in relation to the dangers of taking ecstasy, or tablets being passed off as ecstasy.<br /><br />&quot;They are illegal and could contain a cocktail of toxic ingredients.<br /><br />“The exact contents of the pills are unknown but they could contain dangerous chemicals and users need to be aware of the dangers and understand the devastating effect they can have.”<br /><br />Police say some of the Green Rolex pills have been found to contain a dangerous stimulant methoxyamphetamine, known as PMA.<br /><br />They are also warning of a white pill with the Mitsubishi logo imprinted on it, found to contain other lethal chemicals, and a yellow tablet with a star logo.<br /><br />Officers also recovered fake ecstasy pills from a house in Aberdeen yesterday.<br /><br />Richard Stevenson, a doctor in emergency medicine at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, warned the fake pills could give victims a high temperature and hallucinations.<br /><br />He said: “These symptoms are treatable if help is sought early.<br /><br />&quot;I would urge anyone who begins to feel unwell or feels a more intense high than usual after taking any drug to seek immediate medical help.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				My belief is that abstinence-only education simply does not work. For example, teaching kids that they should never, ever have sex is not going to stop them from having sex. It&#039;s simply going to cause them to get pregnant and get STDs. So while a lot of people may not be comfortable with the idea of their kids having sex, them having sex safely is way better than their kids getting knocked up or given the life-long gift of genital herpes. So as a result, we have sex education.<br /><br />In my opinion it should also be the same thing with drugs. When I was in school, all drugs were demonized by the school, especially marijuana because it was the most common drug done locally. They taught us all drugs would kill us and to never do them, despite the fact that we all knew it wasn&#039;t true. I was told weed is a gateway drug, that it is very dangerous, and that I should never do it. So when I smoked weed for the first time and all that I felt was being giggly and getting the munchies, I realized my teachers were dead wrong. This led me to start trying other drugs (which I guess proved their point about marijuana being a gateway drug, haha). And so while I took my safety very seriously and researched all the drugs I tried on Erowid and got them from reputable sources such as SR, a lot of my peers went around trying drugs having no idea what they were doing. For example, a bunch of people I graduated with now take what they think is MDMA weekly (around here anyone selling you MDMA is actually giving you methylone), so who knows what kind of damage they&#039;re doing to their brains. Whereas after educating myself on how to use drugs, I learned not to take MDMA more than once every few months, test it, take it with supplements, etc. and so now I can consider myself a very responsible MDMA user.<br /><br />So ultimately you aren&#039;t going to stop kids from doing drugs. They&#039;re going to do drugs regardless of what you tell them. So you might as well teach them how to do drugs safely. And for that reason I have no problem with kids posting here or on other drug forums, or using SR. Ordering to your parent&#039;s house is kind of a dick move but that&#039;s for another discussion.<br /><br />(I&#039;m also probably a bit biased because I&#039;m pretty young as well, but I digress.)

				I&#039;m probably in the &quot;older guys/gals&quot; bracket and I don&#039;t see it as an issue at all.<br /><br />To be honest I&#039;d rather have someone come here, ask questions, (usually) get educated answers and make better decisions.&nbsp; Out on the clearnet if someone is looking up drugs it&#039;s either a site that just says &quot;All drugs are bad&quot; or stories of edge cases where someone takes things to extremes.<br /><br />Heck I have a family member who&#039;s around driving age (in US) and when showing him how a manual transmission works (which he&#039;s never seen before... yeah I can hear the palms hitting faces from across the globe). The reason I showed it to him is because even though his parents have said if he&#039;s with a group of people and the driver is drunk (or as I said anything that impairs him from driving) that his parents would pick him up no questions asked.&nbsp; Knowing full well he wouldn&#039;t do that I&#039;d much rather have him have at least some idea how a manual transmission works so if that day comes I&#039;d rather have him kinda get by than someone who clearly shouldn&#039;t be driving.<br /><br />Likewise I have mentioned erowid.org to people all the time.&nbsp; Before I did anything myself I was still on there looking up things so I know what to do if one of my friends started to have some bad effects on something.<br /><br />Knowledge is power as they say.

				Kids see drugs kids do drugs.&nbsp; Drugs shouldn&#039;t be done by those under 21 because of biological reasons but they are doing them.&nbsp; That said I would rather kids get drugs here with a feedback system than having a 12th grader sell him drugs that neither of them know anything about and are possibly fake.&nbsp; Like all the ecstasy in high school, i took many many tabs, did not contain mostly mdma.&nbsp; It was almost like gambling what drug you were ingesting.&nbsp; Although my favorite treat was MDA tabs.&nbsp; I would keep them all for my friends and myself.

				In a more perfect world, controlled substances would be sold in the same way as alcohol and therefore vendors would require ID. But just like alcohol, drugs would eventually get diverted to minors. So, where there&#039;s a will there&#039;s a way is always and will always be the case. However, the more transparent the marketplace, the more regulated it becomes in effect. Although SR is not regulated by any gov&#039;t entity, the users and the admins regulate it to some degree. The more regulated the marketplace is, the greater the harm reduction. SR and like sites are currently the most transparent and therefore regulated drug marketplaces in the world. I wish that minors would not choose to take drugs, but at least hopefully with sites like this and discussion forums, they&#039;ll have some clue of what they&#039;re taking and maybe a few will absorb enough information to make less bad choices.

				Well chances are if a young kid is here, then life sucks. They apparently not communicating with their parents well, and they are nerding it up instead of getting laid, but yes let&#039;s hope they nerd it up enough for the research as well. As mentioned earlier though, I worry about how chatty they can be and may try to use SR to be the cool kid for a day. Also as stated kids can be 25, it is very true that the maturity level has gone down a lot in young adults. <br /><br />Here is an example.<br /><br />I was at a restaurant not too long ago and these two girls were there. They were non stop snickering and had some ridiculous clothes and hats on, even for kids. They had to be at least 18 to because they were collage students. I think these two went to the mall and bought the stupidest shit they could find, and acted stoned all day for attention, they may have even thought they were stoned. They did smell like smoke but it was more like cigarettes and burnt grass. These 2 were really fucking annoying to the point that I wanted to stand up and say &quot;That&#039;s what morons think weed is and that is why we can&#039;t have it&quot;. <br /><br />This also shows how much I have grown up because years ago I would have picked these girls up with a good horny strain and had a fun time. Damn, I just realized how long I have been married.&nbsp;

				&quot;There are a lot of ways to get to Rome&quot; <br /><br />If they wouldn&#039;t get it here, they will get it somewhere else. I think there are a lot of experienced users on this forum who know what they are talking about. Before they get on the SR their interest in drugs is probably very high otherwise they wouldn&#039;t even come here. Please let everybody just help them kids as much as we can if they are asking advice. If we tell them not to do, who the fuck are we for them? Just a random (wo)man somewhere on fucking planet earth. They would do it anyways.
