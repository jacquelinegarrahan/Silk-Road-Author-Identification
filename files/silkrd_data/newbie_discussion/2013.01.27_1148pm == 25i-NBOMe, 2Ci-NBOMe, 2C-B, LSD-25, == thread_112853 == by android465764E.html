				LSD-25.&nbsp; d-lysergic acid diethylamide. This is acid. <br /><br />But what are 25i-NBOMe and 2Ci-NBOMe? <br /><br />From what I can tell, they are marketed as psychedelics which is accurate(?) but other than that, I can find precious little info about these two chemicals. <br /><br />Would anyone care to offer an idiot&#039;s guide, please?<br />I looked on erowid, but there&#039;s not a great deal of info..&nbsp;

				First off, 25i-nbome and 2ci-nbome are the same thing.<br />25i is an analogue of 2c-i, which basically means 2c-i is like the parent and 25i the child, they are very similar with some differences, and act very similar.&nbsp; 25-i is active at VERY small doses (in the micrograms), with 1 milligram being considered a relatively high dose.&nbsp; 2c-i however, is active in the milligrams, with the average dose being about 25mg.&nbsp; I actually just ordered some 25-i, it should be here tomorrow.&nbsp; i haven&#039;t tried it yet, but I have tried 2c-i.&nbsp; It was mildly similar to LSD, with much more of a body high and less of a mindfuck.&nbsp; It definitely is a psychedelic, it&#039;s just a fully synthetic one instead of a semi-synthetic one like LSD.

				Hi all, Couldnt find a specific thread relating to this that i could post on, So Reply to this comment if you can help me out. <br /><br />I was looking for some LSD, I saw a couple of vendors, Il include the links as i go, That had different doses of tabs and prices.<br /><br />Here first of all is the vendor &quot; NeuroticNarcotic&quot; who is selling&nbsp; 5X blotters for 7.20 and the UG is 300. I thought this was fairly high in both price and dosage per blotter but am willing to pay that if they were A+++ quality. - i&#039;ve lost this link however it&#039;s only 3 or 4 pages into the LSD tab.<br /><br />Second the seller&nbsp; &quot; Tyl3r Durden &quot; from the UK, Seems like a genuinely good seller has been responding to messages and helpful , But i saw his tabs , 25 X 1200 UG tabs for 1.55 .&nbsp; 25 tabs for that cheap , With the highest dose i have seen on anything ever. Is that dosage even possible?&nbsp; And if so, Do you think they genuinely are lab tested and of that quality?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/6b5ecbdf2c<br /><br />Lastly the seller &quot; EnterTheMatrix &quot; They have 5 blotters of LSD for 6.30 and the dosage is 250ug. <br /><br />Im looking for the highest quality . Any help appreciated. Thanks all
