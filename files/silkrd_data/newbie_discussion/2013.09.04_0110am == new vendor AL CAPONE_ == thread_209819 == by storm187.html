I just adjusted the ounce and QP pricing slightly. QP is a great price per ounce. There&#039;s a lot of room to make money.<br /><br />Quality is good. Its not top shelf or as good as my chemdawg. However, it has good sized nugs for resell, lots of crystals, and a very smooth smoke. If you&#039;ve smoked my chemdawg or Sour Diesel, this bud is not as sticky and slightly less potent.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209819.msg1542867#msg1542867">Quote from: flyr1017- on September 16, 2013, 10:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To be honest, that big stem in the picture is what is kind of turning me off it<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry about that. I was in a hurry while putting up the listings. Just put up an actual photos of several buds to see.<br /><br />If anyone who has posted in this forum so far would like to order, I&#039;ll offer you free shipping on your first purchase.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D
