				Hi,<br /><br />i had no prior opiate tolerance and ordered heroin #3 and #4 from two different reputable vendors on SR.&nbsp; I sniffed it and it didn&#039;t induce any euphoria. It was definitely no matter of dosage, since i nodded after sniffing a few lines. Also my pupils were really small and my body itches as fuck ;)<br />Is it possible that heroin doesn&#039;t induce euphoria in some individual or was i scammed? Would be interested in your input!<br /><br />dupas

				Hey dupas.<br />I also suffer from depression. MDMA made me happy but it felt fake and really just hid the problem for a good 8 hours, and I felt much worse after.<br /><br />However, having a vacation from reality really made the difference for me. Last year in October I did about 4grams of mushrooms, closed my eyes with some good music and just let my mind work. I was out of the funk until probably April. I took 1mg tab of 25i-nbome recently and just laid back and enjoyed the trip. I have been happy for about a week now. Hopefully longer!<br /><br />I&#039;ve also read that LSD/LSA has similar effects on depression.<br /><br />Have you tried any of these drugs?

				Thanks for your nice reply, ejammings!<br />I tried MDMA years ago and even though i was not so feeling bad back then, i felt SO depressed after coming down. I guess it&#039;s the lack of serotonin after coming down. Not to imagine what would happen if i took MDMA in the state i&#039;m in right now ...<br /><br />Concerning the other drugs you have mentioned, i would be afraid to have a bad trip that completly fucks me up. I have quite a lot respect of psychedelics. But it might be worth a try ...<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I personally believe that psychedelics are worth the risk if it can help with something as horrible and debilitating as depression.&nbsp; If you have .10 bitcoin check out http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/99b619e6a9 <br /><br />If you decide you never want to take it sell it to some chump for 50 dollars or toss it in the trash!<br /><br />It&#039;s an epic deal that I wish I could take advantage of (My bitcoin providers have been down for weeks, waiting for verification at an exchange.. /sigh )<br />

				I feel like H is more of a body high and outrageous nodding (ive never iv&#039;ed only snorted) i receive more mind high from hydrocodone and oxycodone. personally i love the feeling of oxy it gives you a great body high but your mind remains really active, more sociable, feel good, euphoria.&nbsp; give it a try!

				Reading this, it seems to me like you might have rather unrealistic expectations of the opiate experience.<br /><br />Yes, one does generally experience &quot;euphoria&quot; with Heroin, but it is totally, completely and utterly different to the kind of euphoria you get with MDMA for instance.<br /><br />Although people can and do experience psychotropic drugs differently, Heroin generally affects people more or less the same way because of the way it works - all human beings have opiate receptors and the two main ones are &quot;kappa&quot; and &quot;mu&quot; receptors, and it is by triggering these that we get the &quot;euphoric&quot; effect.<br /><br />Heroin is my drug of choice - my entire adult life has been spent as an addict (altho a &quot;high-functioning&quot; addict). <br />Had my first taste aged 17 and now I am in my 40s.<br /><br />The &quot;euphoria&quot; I get with H is a warm sense of well-being and warmth, of safety and comfort, and when I am stoned all my problems cease to exist.<br /><br />But please, seriously - do not fool around with this stuff. <br /><br />Heroin gave me something that I was missing, it made me feel complete and as a result, I have spent more than three decades and quite literally millions upon millions of dollars to keep feeling that feeling of warmth and well-being.<br /><br />This is deadly serious - literally - and I have overdosed and been clinically dead countless times, had abscesses, septicaemia (blood poisoning - not fun at all), Hepatitis C, collapsed veins, and all kinds of horrific complications. <br /><br />Currently on 120mg methadone every day - and have tried every treatment there is.<br />My brother describes me as &quot;an example of how not to live&quot;.<br /><br />Anyhow, please be careful. Don&#039;t follow in my footsteps, or end up dead.

				Thanks a lot for your replies! I really appreciate your postings!<br /><br />I guess i should be really careful about using in H in my current situation. Since i have no job right now, i&#039;m bored alot and think that it would be so nice to get a little bit high. This behaviour can lead pretty fast into addiction ...<br />So it might be better to find a job and only use occasionally (if this is even possible). Lets see ...<br /><br />dupas

				I&#039;ve tried 30mg morphine yesterday, first time doing opiates (besides codeine) and felt really bored. The warmth was nice but no euphoria, no waves, just that completely spaced out feeling and the nod. Really not something I would waste my life with.&nbsp;

				Fentanyl is the most powerful opiate around but there is a very fine line between dose and overdose so you gotta be extremely careful.<br />It can be extremely pleasurable, but take it easy because if you overdo it even a bit you fall asleep and miss out on the best part.<br /><br />Another good one is Hydromorphone (Dilaudid - &quot;D&quot; in the movie Drugstore Cowboy) which produces a very peaceful high.<br /><br />Maybe take a look at the Experience Vaults on Erowid and see what other people think. (erowid.org has loads of info)

				Dupas,&nbsp; I normally ingest ~3.5g drinking strictly orange juice, and just sit and watch music videos on vevo/youtube. Lights dim. Volume down a bit. And lay down on the ground and close my eyes once in awhile and enjoy the euphoria + minor closed eye visuals.<br /><br />Have a blanket handy and make sure you have access to cold drinks. It will help if you get stomach cramps from fasting.<br /><br />If you have people around make sure they are people you actually like. Being able to share your experience makes it much more uplifting. My only bad trip was doing mushrooms with strangers in a place I&#039;ve never been. <br /><br />EDIT: I&#039;ve tried oxycontin and it was a waste of money. Sure I felt &quot;good&quot; but it did nothing to help my mind which is what causes the problems.

				Depus,&nbsp; You&#039;ve inadvertently opened a topic I intend to post about when I have time.&nbsp; In my experience, and in the experience of my friends who I keep in touch with from that period in my life many years ago when I used heroin and cocaine, heroin and cocaine have somehow, inexplicably &#039;changed&#039; and no longer afford the profound pleasure which they used to give several decades ago.&nbsp; Regarding Heroin, I&#039;ve bought from nearly everyone on SR and I&#039;ve found most of the heroin quite strong, yet it lacks the intense pleasurable feelings and euphoria that I used to get from heroin years ago.&nbsp; I made reference to this in a post a few days ago and received this interesting response:&nbsp; &quot;OMG!!!!&nbsp; You are the first person to say what I&#039;ve been thinking the whole time I&#039;ve been on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on SR for 1 yr, been buying H, and have bought from every vendor who&#039;s suppossedto have &quot;fire&quot;................I&quot;ve also used in th real world, although not since the 90s&lt; and the comparison is a total joke.&nbsp; &nbsp;The dope I&quot;ve used in real life, was amazing, euphoric, my body felt like it was wrapped in velvet, warm pleasurable bliss, etc etc&nbsp; But, even the best dope I&#039;ve gotten on SR has been about 1/3 as pleasurable as the stuff I&#039;ve had irl.&nbsp; I dont get why everyone brags like crazy on these forums about the stuff they are using, even those people who say they are long time users are on these forums bragging about the quality, honestly, I&quot;ve been thinking that for the amount of money that&#039;s being charged for this stuff on SR, its really not worth buying the stuff at all considering how dissappointing the high can be, Anyway, I wanted to reply to you bc you are speaking something I&#039;ve been thinking for the last year, I dont have enough posts to post to the forum so i thought i&#039;d pm you.&quot;&nbsp; So, besides my friends, there are others who have experienced the exact same thing as me.&nbsp; How do other old-timers feel about changes in heroin from those days to now?

				I can say anything about heroin first hand only from friends that did it<br />and from what I was told.<br />Friends or aquaintences&nbsp; have sat at my kitchen table and booted<br />a dime bag and from what i saw was almost instant effect.<br />Most the time could not or did not finish hit and left needle just hanging from arm for a long time like an hour and just sat their with eyes closed.<br />Another friend would do speed ball he was fine.<br /><br />basically they would buy dime bags in the big city and come back and resell for 20 and thats how if fed itself.<br />Then I was told the first time you will get sick and puke.<br />So if its your first time and you dont puke I guess its not the good stuff as I have seen<br /><br />I was told &quot;You should try heroin it is better than sex&quot;<br />Well I dont know if they just have had bad sex or no sex or this heroin was that good and its the best feeling in the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;I believe that it what it should feel like and do to you.<br />So if the euphoria is not on par to at least sex then why should it be so addictive world wide.<br /><br /><br />

				If you dead-set keen on fully experiencing the Hammer of the Gods, then I guess no one can stop you. <br /><br />It sounds like you&#039;re using gear obtained on SR by yourself, in which case you&#039;d be better off chasing the dragon than snorting. <br /><br />Why? you ask<br /><br />Because smoking will allow you to control the level of intoxication much more effectively than doing lines will. <br />Say you snort a fat line ... you won&#039;t be able to gauge the effect immediately - instead you have to wait for the goodness to enter your body via the mucous membrane in your nose and throat, then enter your bloodstream, and finally cross the blood-brain barrier. <br />By the time the effect registers you will need another line to augment if necessary, and you won&#039;t know if you have ingested a lethal dose until you stop breathing. By which time it is too late. <br /><br />Get a piece of tinfoil, crease it along the middle, drop a few grains of gear on, hold at an angle while heating the underside with a lighter held in your other hand. The powder liquefies and clouds of smoke appear. Inhale using the tube of foil or glass that is held in your mouth and hold in the smoke. <br /><br />This should enable you to get pleasantly high, yet stop before you get too fucked up or dead. <br />And while getting shit-faced you can pretend to be Lord Byron, Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle or Coleridge in an opium den.

The H that I have found on SR is so clean that it could very easily kill someone who didn&#039;t know what they are doing. I have been using for more than 20 years and am on a daily dose of methadone - in case you didn&#039;t know, the latter actually protects me from overdose by binding to opiate receptors in the brain. <br /><br />Yesterday I indulged in some exceptionally high quality gear - and it was, for me, an extremely enjoyable experience.&nbsp; This is because i possesses the knowledge - gained through real world contact - to be able to gauge. the quality from look, taste and smell. As a result, I knew instinctively how much I could safely consume and enjoy the experience without dying. <br /><br />For an &quot;opiate naive&quot; newbie however, especially some teen sitting alone in a darkened bedroom (no offense but that&#039;s what most people on these forums sound like), the risk of death would have been very, very real. <br /><br />This is not a fucking game kids - this shit is deadly. <br /><br />If you want to play this particular game if Russian Roulette.

				My apologies to the person I quoted in my last post - my diatribe was not directed at you specifically. <br />I had actually begun to write a response about technique since trial and error is an integral part of learning. Please<br />Do not feel I was singling you out - your willingness to keep trying is commendable. <br /><br />However it then occurred to me (I just woke up so am still half asleep) that just as easily as you guys might have has no effect at all, you could easily have gone to the other extreme and died. <br /><br />I have overdosed many, many times and the reason I am still here is due entirely to the actions of other people. <br /><br />Please - if you are a first-time user of opiates do not use alone. <br /><br />When a person OD&#039;s they themselves experience no time lapse between losing and regaining consciousness. <br /><br />The outside world sees a body with unnaturally pale skin and blue lips (yes your lips actually turn blue when you stop breathing) and at this point you have less than four minutes to live unless someone successfully revives you. <br /><br />If I had not been through this - on both sides of the equation - many times, I would not be writing these words. <br /><br />The first time you see a friend become a corpse before your eyes you will remember too.

				Oh, wow. I really thought I was the only one. I held out on trying heroin forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I first must say my situation is a little different, because i am a pain patient and I do tend to have a high tolerance. But I always joke and say &quot;I want a new drug,&quot; because nothing seems to get me high anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />For example, I tried meth and got hungry and sleepy while everyone else stayed up all night. Didn&#039;t like it at all. Crack made me chatty for a few minutes, then yuck.&nbsp; Cocaine is okay, but it doesn&#039;t last long and who can afford that anyway?&nbsp; I tried X and got a stomach ache after a little chattiness.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; I hate weed. <br /><br />So....since I already take opiates, I figured heroin (if smoked or snorted) would be the same thing in the long run. Finally broke down and ordered some, took a very small amount, because I wanted to be careful, and I couldn&#039;t figure out why I was so miserable.&nbsp; Turns out, I was actually starting into withdrawals!&nbsp; Took me three bags to even feel a little bit of anything and NO euphoria.&nbsp; I was (and am) bummed as hell.&nbsp; Thinking I might just have to get brave and try a little more. Because God knows I cannot afford pills.&nbsp; So I figured this was a nice alternative as far as budget goes, but not if I need 3x the amount others do.<br /><br />Ironically I live in a state that is supposed to have some of the best, purest heroin in the country, but I have NO connections; thus, I am looking here for that person with heroin that actually gives me that euphoria I would like to feel again. Even for a small amount of time.&nbsp; And I will never shoot, so I guess I just have to keep searching.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not a fiend, lol. I would just like to feel good for a while, have a nice afternoon or evening with that euphoric feeling I used to get from opiate pills.<br /><br />Thanks for letting me vent and for letting me know I am not alone.&nbsp; I just posted asking for suggestions for higher quality h sellers on The Silk Road, and I will keep you posted if I find such a person/product.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Hope

				hopesalive, i&#039;m also a chronic pain patient and have a large opiate tolerance. if you&#039;re looking for strong #4 , try subsrgood. he&#039;s got the nicest powder i&#039;ve ever had -- a small test bump that i assumed wouldnt do anything, had me warm n fuzzy after 15 minutes. i also hear wonderful things about GotsItAll &#039;s dope, though i havent tried it yet. MisterMcFeely had some really lovely, very strong tar last i ordered, but his listings havent been up in a week or two. Purest&#039;s tar was also nice, though imo a bit overpriced.<br /><br />as for fentanyl, SunWu has awesome deals on nasal spray and fent HCL, although i must say he/they are somewhat curt with the communications IME. the nasal spray is wonderful, i&#039;m planning to make my own sometime soon.

				I have been on and off opiates many times before.&nbsp; Bottom line is that any good feeling you get from H or any other opiate is NOT worth the pain you feel going through withdrawal.&nbsp; If you are seriously depressed, you should see out other non-physically addicting substances or activites like exercise to combat it.&nbsp; An opiate will mask it for a few hours, then depression comes right back even harder than before.&nbsp; Then over time, if you don&#039;t get your opiate, you will be 10x more depressed than you were originally.&nbsp; Then it will take MONTHS before you even feel normal again or have a decent night&#039;s sleep.<br /><br />I am not your mother, but please consider using something else than opiates to battle depression.&nbsp; It never works out well in the end.<br /><br />Best of luck to you.

				I&#039;ve never gone through withdrawal without some kind of aid, i.e., some opiate of lesser strength for the worst few days.&nbsp; But from the little bit of withdrawal I&#039;ve been through I can&#039;t imagine what it would be like to go through unaided withdrawal, or rather, I can imagine and I wouldn&#039;t want to go through it.&nbsp;

Can you tell me how long that one spray bottle lasts? Because the post says you only need one or two sprays and there are many sprays per bottle, which I have a hard time believing (esp with my tolerance).<br /><br />Thank you, also, for the recommendations.&nbsp; I was just bookmarking GotsItAll for a possible order on Wed.&nbsp; I was very impressed with the shipping time and stealth from the first person I tried, plus GREAT communication, but I was just so disheartened by the product itself.&nbsp; I will definitely search for the others you have mentioned. This is just what I was hoping for: some help and recommendations. Looks like I came to the right place, lol. <br /><br />Take care and thank you so much, once again!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh, and how in the world can you &quot;make your own?&quot;&nbsp; If I order from GotsItAll I will report back for you.&nbsp; You have been so helpful!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />p<br /><br />the spray bottle itself lasted me quite a lil while for the cost, maybe 2-3 weeks, and i used it pretty much every day, at least once. there are i&#039;m told 140 sprays in a bottle, (though some of mine leaked in the package) and i usually needed 2-3 sprays for decent pain relief by itself, maybe 1spray if i used it on top of my inadequate scripts, sometimes more for those &#039;i&#039;d otherwise need the er&#039; situations. i was skeptical of the strength but very pleasantly surprised. i used it mostly to stretch out my prescriptions, and it works really, REALLY well, but only for an hour or two.<br /><br />re: making my own, SunWu offers the fentanyl HCL that he uses to make his spray, in amounts as low as 100mg -- which would make i believe around 6 bottles of the nasal spray he offers, for a much lower cost, as i&#039;m willing to buy bacteriostatic water and go through the effort of making and bottling it myself to save cash in the long run. even despite the short time fentanyl works, i feel its worth it for such strong pain relief, especially considering the cost compared to other opiates.<br /><br />i&#039;d love to hear how it goes with GIA&#039;s dope! i&#039;m considering giving him a try very soon as well.

				if you&#039;re looking for strictly euphoria, try MDMA or mescaline. my best mescaline trips have been more euphoric than even MDMA for me. heroin is more of a warm, comforting, painkilling drug than utter &#039;euphoria,&#039; at least for me.

MDMA made me happy but it felt fake and really just hid the problem for a good 8 hours, and I felt much worse after.<br /><br />However, having a vacation from reality really made the difference for me. Last year in October I did about 4grams of mushrooms, closed my eyes with some good music and just let my mind work. I was out of the funk until probably April. I took 1mg tab of 25i-nbome recently and just laid back and enjoyed the trip. I have been happy for about a week now. Hopefully longer!<br /><br />I&#039;ve also read that LSD/LSA has similar effects on depression.<br /><br />Have you tried any of these drugs?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Hey , did the 25i cause allot of chest tension on the come down? And how the heck did you just &quot;lay back&quot; with it?<br />For me , all psychedelics make me jittery, especially on the come up. I have to move when im trippin. Though , i must say with 25i, once i got into 3+ hrs into trip i was able to chill back in awe on a bench, just laughing my ass off at life, colors, music,...blissed out to the max!<br />&nbsp;By thevway, I get that too, the after glow from a psychedelic trip lasts for a long time...its like one sees life in a new way for awhile. Meditation for an hour early every morning can do this as well. It takes practice, but if diligent meditation can induce a feeling not unlike an orgasm. But its a whole body rush, and it lingers through the day, like a great sex romp, but better. Sex is always great too.<br />cheers!

				working on it as i write this...<br /><br />so far i was wrapping it in a few layers of plastic and crushing it (or trying to) with my TV remote.. but this seems to have been a bad idea, as i tore my lil baggie. i have a few teeny bags around i will have to find to replace it. the method works for pills, eh.. sigh. i have a pill grinder i could likely use pretty well, but i&#039;ll have to clean the living hell out of it, it&#039;s caked with like 5 years of god knows what, amphetamines and opiates/apap pills and benadryl and lord knows what.. i&#039;ve been wanting a nice mortar and pestle for ages, this may be my excuse to get one. <br /><br />hah i&#039;ve got it. i mostly-crushed a small rock to little teeny sand-grain pebbles, laid em in 2 lines on a book cover, and then just smushed one line/ground down on it with the flat side of a lighter. had to scrape the powder off the lighter but it&#039;s pretty fine now. definitely going to have to figure out a better method for the rest of this, it took 20min of work to crush up a tester line and one extra. i cant spent 20min on each little bump, no bueno.<br /><br />on the upside, less than 5min after railing a little bump, my hands have dried out and stopped shaking, my grumbleguts are calming down, and my anxiety-related chest pains are gone. i think this dope may hit faster than subs.. i have a lil bump or two left of subs gear that i saved just in case nothing showed today to try to ward off too much sickies.. i want to compare it side by side with GIA&#039;s at some point this weekend and get a real feel for the legs, the come-up, and the qualities of the individual highs.<br /><br />I love silk road. i really do. i LOVE the option of different suppliers who ALL have decent dope, none of whom are going to mug me or slap my ass or try to follow me home. i love that this is run like a legit business, and not like some shady back-alley fuckover deal. i love having my drugs and medications delivered to my door. <br /><br />damn this is good dope, i got that good gear ramble goin on... i need to go leave GIA a kickass feedback and review before i get too high.

				There are MANY factors involved in &quot;how much heroin&#039; is ACTUALLY in your heroin!&nbsp; &nbsp;From where it&#039;s grown to how it&#039;s harvested!<br /><br />Here you go ... a very good easy to understand &quot;how to make heroin&quot; article<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Making of Heroin<br />*******************************<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Corrections from people who know more about chemistry this chemistry than I do (i.e, pretty much anyone! lol) are welcomed.<br /><br />I. The Poppy<br /><br />Illicit cultivation of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) has traditionally been an Asian business. More recently, production has spread to the highlands of the tropical regions of the Western Hemisphere, primarily Mexico and Colombia. The worldwide illicit opium harvest in 1995 was estimated at 4,157 metric tons, the majority accounted for by the estimated 2,561 tons produced in Southeast Asia (primarily Myanmar (Burma), with significant crops also in Laos, Thailand, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia) . Following Southeast Asia is Southwest Asia, primarily Afghanistan (with smaller amounts growing in Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, India, Lebanon and Khirgistan), these two regions accounting for the vast majority of opium destined for conversion to illicit heroin. Colombia was estimated to have produced 65.5 tons of opium in 1996 , while Mexico was estimated to have grown 53 tons in 1995. Heroin originating from these Western Hemisphere sources is destined almost exclusively for the United States, while Southeast Asian product enjoys worldwide distribution. Heroin of Southwest Asian origin is mostly exported to Europe or consumed locally.<br /><br />P. somniferum is an annual, flowering plant, believed to have evolved, through centuries of breeding and cultivation, from a wild-growing ancestor native to the northeastern Mediterranean coast. It grows best in dry, temperate climates, usually at altitudes of over 800 meters (2500 ft) above sea-level. The optimal growing season is from September to July depending on the regional climate. In Southeast Asia, planting is completed by late October, in order to take advantage of the long days of the Southern Hemisphere winter. Growing plots are selected for maximum sun exposure on slopes of gradients of 20 to 40 degrees for optimal drainage. (Excessive moisture is damaging to the plant). About one pound of seed is needed to sow one acre of land. By November, when the young plant enters the cabbage or lettuce stage and has reached a height of about one foot, some of the plants are removed in order to leave room for the others to grow (about 1 to 2 feet between plants). A typical opium poppy field has 60,000 to 120,000 plants per hectare (2.46 acres). The mature plant reaches a height of about 2-5 feet by late winter, beginning to flower after about 90 days of growth, 3 to 8 flowers per plant. Flowering continues for several weeks, reaching full bloom by early spring (or later, depending on the region; later development is typical in more western regions .<br />&nbsp;After full bloom, the petals drop to reveal a small, round grayish-green fruit which continues to develop into an oblate, elongated or globular capsule ( also called the seedpod, bulb or poppy head) about the size of a chicken egg. The skin of the pod encloses the ovary, the walls of which secrete the latex (opium) which collects in a network of vessels and tubes throughout the pod.<br /><br />About two weeks after the petals have fallen, the pods are fully mature, as indicated by the aforementioned shape of the capsule, a change in color from grayish-green to dark green; the points of the pods crown now stand straight out or are curved upward. At this point the pods are ready to be scored (or tapped, incised or lanced). Harvesters make the incision with a a three- or four- bladed instrument (iron or glass blades bound tightly on a wooden handle), designed to make an incision of about one millimeter deep. (Too deep an incision may result in excessive spilling either into the center of the pod or to the ground; too shallow and the latex will not ooze as desired). The pods are scored two to three times each in the afternoon, causing the white latex to drip onto the surface of the pod. The opium oxidizes, darkens, and thickens overnight, and in the morning is scraped from the surface with a flat iron blade. This process is repeated over several days until each pod is depleted of its opium. Each pod may yield from 10 to 100 milligrams of opium, with an average of 80 milligrams, which is set aside in a container to dry in the sun. (Pods giving highest yields are marked, cut from the plant, cut open and dried in the sun, their seeds saved for the next planting). Dried, raw opium is brown to black in color; higher-quality product is brown and sticky. A typical farm will produce 3 to 9 kilograms of opium per acre.<br /><br />II. Opium: Some vital statistics<br /><br />Over 40 different alkaloids have been identified as present in opium, mostly as salts of meconic acid . The most important of these, of course, is morphine. Although Turkish opium (Druggists Opium) may contain up to 21% morphine , the average morphine content of opium tapped from P. somniferum is 9 to 14% by mass. Next most prominent is codeine (3-methoxymorphine) which constitutes 0.5 to 2.5% of the dried latex. Noscapine, comprising 4 to 8% of opium, has been used as an over-the-counter, non-psychoactive cough suppressant (6). Papaverine, present at 0.5 to 2.5%, is sold as a digestive antispasmodic. Thebaine, 0.5 to 2%, is a convulsant in high doses; it is also similar in structure to morphine is used in the licit manufacture of semisynthetic opiates such as hydrocodone and oxycodone. <br />(Other species of poppy, notably _Papaver bracteatum_ , contain higher concentrations of thebaine and are cultivated for the extraction of this alkaloid ). Other alkaloids include narceine, protopine, laudanine (laudanosine), codamine, cryptopine, lanthopine, and others.<br /><br />Ideally, the above alkaloids should be removed in the purification of opium for conversion to heroin. However, clandestine chemistry is rarely ideal, and some of these alkaloids are often not removed, remaining as imupurities of origin. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; The most notable impurity of origin results from the failure to remove codeine. The manufacture of heroin, discussed in detail below, involves the acetylation of morphine to form 3,6-diacetylmorphine. Acetylated codeine (acetylcodeine) often constitutes 10% of the narcotic content of street heroin, sometimes up to 45% of this quantity.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Acetylcodeine is a key marker used in signature analysis of heroin, as the heroin-to-acetylmorphine ratio of seized batches has been found to vary among source countries . Also, acetylcodeine has been found to be two times as toxic as diacetylmorphine (heroin) in mice , and hence it may contribute to street heroins toxicity. Unreacted morphine and codeine are also present in some poorly processed heroin, which may bring about adverse reactions in users, especially when the drug is injected intravenously. The non-phenanthrene alkaloids (i.e, all alkaloids except morphine, codeine, and thebaine) are more rarely found, probably decomposed in the acetylation process. Noscapine, papaverine, laudanosine and/or cryptopine are occasionally present but in such small amounts that although toxic at higher doses, they are not thought to contribute to the pharmacological effects of street heroin. Thebaine is decomposed by acetylation, and although the decomposed product, acetylthebaol, is sometimes present, it is not thought to have any harmful effect.<br /><br />III. Heroin manufacture<br /><br />The complete conversion of raw opium to pure heroin hydrochloride (diacetylmorphine HCl) may be summarized as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Purification of raw opium --&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; extraction/purification of morphine from opium --&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; conversion of morphine to heroin base --&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; purification of heroin base and conversion to hydrochloride salt. <br /><br />After step 4, diluents and adulterants may be added either by the manufacturer or by parties further along the distribution chain. Also, shortcuts may be taken at steps 2, 3 and 4, and steps 2 and 4 may be eliminated altogether. The process delineated in this section is that observed in Southeast Asia, designed to result in nearly pure diacetylmorphine HCl. A brief discussion of how the aforementioned shortcuts bear on the properties of heroin originating from other regions and comments on diluents and adulterants commonly found in seized samples will follow.<br /><br />1.) Purification of opium.<br /><br />Raw opium collected from the poppy as described above is placed in an open cooking pot of boiling water. This should dissolve all of the alkaloids in the opium, while solid plant material, soil, twigs, etc. remain undissolved and float to the top of the solution. Solid impurities are scooped out or filtered by straining the mixture though cheesecloth or burlap. The liquid is then re-heated over a low flame, evaporating the water to leave behind a thick, dark paste, which is then dried in the sun. The opium left behind has a putty-like consistency and is generally about 20% lighter (20% more pure) than the raw material. At this point the product may be exported for smoking or eating or consumed locally. This process may be carried out by farmers before shipping for consumption or further processing, or the raw opium may be transported to heroin manufacturing sites where the preparation is undertaken on a larger scale.<br />2.) Extraction of morphine.<br /><br />Processed opium is stirred in large drum of boiling water until it has completely dissolved. Slaked lime (calium hydroxide), at about one-fifth the mass of opium, (or a fertilzer with a high lime content) is added to the solution. This has the effect of converting morphine, insoluble in cool water, into the soluble salt, calcium morphenate. For the most part, the other alkaloids do not react, and when the mixture is cooled, the morphenate remains in solution, while the other chemicals settle to form a brown sludge at the bottom of the container. (Codeine is somewhat soluble in water and some amount is likely to remain in solution). <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The calcium morphenate solution is scooped or poured from the drum and filtered and pressed through burlap rice sacks or some other makeshift filtration apparatus. The filtered solution is re-heated, but not boiled, in cooking pots to which ammonium chloride is added at about one-fourth the mass of opium processed. After the pH of the solution reaches 8 or 9 it is cooled. Within a few hours, morphine base and any remaining codeine precipitate out of solution and settle to the bottom of the pot. The solution is then poured off through cloth filters, leaving chunks of morphine base on the cloth, which are squeezed dry and set aside to dry further in the sun. The dried crude morphine base is a coffee-colored powder. <br /><br />(A more scrupulous chemist might use ether in the filtration to dissolve any residual codeine out of the base mixture, but this is not reported in accounts of illicit manufacture).<br /><br />From this point, some manufacturers may proceed directly to step 3. Ideally, however, the crude morphine base is purified by dissolution in dilute hydrochloric (or sufuric) acid, forming a solution of morphine hydrochloride (or sulfate). Activated charcoal is added, and the solution is heated and filtered hot through a fine cloth. The filtration is repeated several times, removing the charcoal and colored impurities with it. The filtrate may be dried in the sun to leave behind morphine hydrochloride, a fine white powder if purification is complete, which may be pressed into 1 kg bricks and transferred for further processing at a remote site. Alternatively, ammonium hydroxide may be added to the morphine HCl solution (or re-dissolved morphine HCl), precipitating morphine base, filtered and dried to form a granular solid.<br /><br />3.) Conversion of morphine to heroin base.<br /><br />The key chemical used in the acetylation of morphine to form heroin is acetic anhydride, a colorless, highly combustible liquid with a strong pickle-like odor. Though internationally controlled as a heroin precursor, acetic anhydride also used to synthesize aspirin and chemicals for leather tanning and photography. Morphine hydrochloride or morphine base is mixed with acetic anhydride at about three-times the mass of the former in a stainless steel or enamel pot. The pot lid is tied or clamped on with a damp towel for a gasket (a makeshift reflux apparatus), and the mixture is heated at 85 degrees Celsius (185 degrees F), avoiding boiling.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The cooking proceeds for about 5 hours until all the morphine has dissolved. The pot is opened, and the mixture -- now a solution of water, acetic acid, and diacetylmorphine (heroin) -- is allowed to cool. Water is added to the mixture at three-times the volume of acetic anhydride, and the mixture is stirred. (Optionally, a small amount of chloroform is added. The mixture is allowed to stand for 20 minutes. The chloroform dissolves colored impurities and settles to the bottom of the pot as a red, greasy liquid, and the water layer is carefully poured off.) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Activated charcoal is added to the mixture, absorbing solid impurities, which are filtered out repeatedly until the solution is clear. Approximately 2.2 kilograms of sodium carbonate (soda ash) per kilogram of morphine are dissolved in hot water and added solwly to the mixture until effervescence stops, precipitating solid heroin base. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Heroin base is filtered with a fine cloth, set aside and heated until dry. The heroin base should be a granular, white powder at this point. If still colored (beige or light brown), the base may be re-dissolved in dilute hydrochloric or citric acid, treated with charcoal again, re-precipitated and dried. Alternatively, in some manufacturing regions, the incompletely purified base may be packed and transported for sale (a practice probably typical in Southwest Asia). About 700 grams of heroin base will be produced from each kilogram of morphine.<br /><br />Optionally, skilled heroin chemists may further purify the base by dissolving it in twice its mass of boiling ethyl alcohol, filtering the solution through a heated funnel into a heated flask. This removes traces of sodium carbonate remaining in the base. The flask is submerged in an ice bath, where it is transformed into a thick white cream. The substance is placed in a pan in a refrigerator with a fan set to blow across the pan to slowly evaporate the alcohol . The paste crystallizes after several hours and is then vacuum filtered. The product, referred to as alcohol morphine base, is re-crystallized heroin base.<br /><br />&nbsp;THIS IS THE FINAL RECRYSTALIZATION STEP WHICH MAKES #4 Heroin<br /><br />&nbsp;4.) Conversion of heroin base to heroin hydrochloride.<br /><br />For each kilogram of heroin base (or re-crystallized heroin base), 6.6 liters of of ethyl alcohol, 6.6 liters of ether, and 225 milliliters of concentrated hydrochloric acid are measured out. The base is dissolved by heating with one-third of the alcohol and one half of the acid. Another one-third of the acid is stirred in. Next, the remaining acid is added slowly, dropwise, until the product is completely converted to the hydrochloride salt. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This result may be confirmed either by observing that a drop of solution evaporates on a glass plate leaving no cloudy residue or by placing a drop of solution on Congo red paper, observing it turn the paper blue. Once the conversion is complete, the remaining alcohol is stirred in. <br />&nbsp; Then half of the ether is added, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 15 minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as crystals begin to form in the solution, the remaining ether is added at once, stirred, and the the vessel is covered. The mixture becomes nearly solid after an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;It is then filtered, and the solids are collected on clean filter paper. Wrapped in the paper, the solid is dried on a wooden tray, usually over lime rock, and dried in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The fully dried product, heroin hydrochloride, is a fine white powder, ready for packing and shipping.<br /><br /><br />References<br /><br />[1] The Supply of Illicit Drugs to the United States: National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee 1995.
