				So I&#039;ve been on the road for about seven months now, and am pretty much just now creating a forum account because I originally came on here to inquire about the abnormal time its been taking for the finds to show up in my SR account. I usually start my business way early in the morning on Mondays and its usually never taken more than 3 hours for the usual method I use. Its going on 8 right now.<br /><br />Although if nobody else has read the main discussion, I guess a mod there has already responded that even though it usually is really fast we have to give like 24 hours before we start to sketch. So it eases my worries a little bit that its a snag on SRs end and not the bitcoin service I use. (I saw my transaction go through blockchain with a bunch of confirmations and addresses which is what I assume SRs tumbling process looks like.) I assume if there were some real problems they probably would have said something, it seems to be for people who made the deposits during that time and I think probably has something to do with all of the attacks going on lately.<br /><br />I guess with everything already addressed I&#039;m just checking if anyone posting as a newbie got on for the same thing and has gotten their funds yet after waiting like the rest of us?

				I am watching this since i noticed it today. I also just created this account cause i never bothered to post here before.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently 95% sure that there is something broken cause my account balance isn&#039;t right either and i read reports of other people who are missing btc in their accounts. (I&#039;m not really upset there was less then 1 BTC there but still...)<br /><br />What really grinds my gears is mods telling us to wait 24 hours because stuff is &quot;normal&quot; and can take a while - obviously this is not normal otherwise there wouldn&#039;t be as many people complaining as there are.<br /><br />Well what can we do? Just wait and see what happens...

				Yeah I just dropped a few thousand off about 4 hours ago and I&#039;m still waiting on it to show up. Hopefully nothing crazy happens in the BTC market, because I don&#039;t need to lose more coins!

				No it&#039;s definitely very disconcerting at the very least, although I remember months back when the road was having some major server issues for a couple weeks a lot of people had some missing coin from making deposits during the crash, but I think it actually mostly was sorted out eventually.<br /><br />It&#039;s just very stressful having your money float around in this type of environment obviously, but I guess that kind of goes with the game. But we all have business we are trying to take care of and have enough to be careful and worry about as is.

				Sometimes deposits and withdrawals are delayed.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t received your coins in 12-24 hours, then you&#039;ll want to send a message to SR Support using the link at the bottom of the following page:<br /><br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/help

				Yeah i remember that time where people where getting to much btc deposited. Shit breaks from time to time.<br /><br />So according to the other thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156494.0<br />DPR is on it. I still don&#039;t get it why they didn&#039;t say so from the beginning but whatever.<br />At least we have friendlyoutlaw fighting the good fight over there.<br /><br />Maybe next time i will have more than 50 posts and can join him.<br /><br />I will wait how this is looking tomorrow and if nothing happened by then I will contact support.

I&#039;m still thinking you guys are just talking at cross purposes and i start to believe maybe it would have been better to keep the site down and show some sort of &quot;we are on maintenance&quot; message, like before when something was broken.<br />You still have to admit that people are moving a lot of money around and get a little bit scared if something doesn&#039;t work the way it used to work.<br /><br />If you guys say the site is still being worked on, then i know all i need to know. It even crossed my mind for a second that your payment back-end got compromised or something - i have seen too much shit regarding bitcoin related site hacks to not consider that.

				But you know the site has been under attack and down ... and if you have been keeping up with DPR&#039;s updates, then you know we aren&#039;t yet out of the woods from the attacks.&nbsp; Knowing that, hopefully you can understand why things aren&#039;t back at 100% quite yet!

				Honestly, i didn&#039;t know the site was still being worked on. But well looks like I&#039;m not the only one. I kinda understand that before posting a good search will probably get you what you need (this is why I never registered before). I guess we all can still learn a thing or two. Just to make it clear:&nbsp; I don&#039;t really interpret:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">UPDATE (05/04/2013 2120 UTC): The site is back up.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to say we are out of the woods yet, but unless something unexpected happens, we should remain up for the foreseeable future.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />as &quot;we are still working on the site&quot;. More like &quot;we are back up but there is still some DDOS coming in&quot;<br /><br />I still think it would be a good idea to implement some sort of infobox on the login screen where crucial information like this is shown. Something like &quot;we&#039;re back online, but the site is still being worked on don&#039;t expect everything to work right away&quot; would have calmed some minds.<br /><br />Well again, no worries. I just want SR to keep up a good service and keep improving said service. ;D

				That&#039;s what I&#039;m saying - we&#039;re back up, but as DPR stated we are not yet out of the woods .... which means the security measures put in place due to the attacks are still in place and might be slowing things down.
