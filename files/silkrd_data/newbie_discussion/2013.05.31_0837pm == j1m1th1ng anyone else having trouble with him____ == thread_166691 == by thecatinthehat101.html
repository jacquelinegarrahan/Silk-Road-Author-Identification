				Okay I got to ask first of all I&#039;m not about flaming people on the boards that&#039;s not what I&#039;m about at all. Ordered from him in the past no problems but is anyone else having trouble with j1m1th1ng its been like 4 days and despite what he said my order still hasn&#039;t shipped. I practically begged him to try and get it out before the weekend but it looks like that&#039;s not gonna happen either.That&#039;s like all the money I have so I left hanging.&nbsp; Its a simple order nothing complicated and I hate the fact that the cancel button is greyed out in matters like this cause it leaves the buyer stuck and unable to do anything till the time period expires.

				Pvp and mdpv mainly can be found in the stimulants section I think I&#039;m the only one who seems to be having trouble with him shipping shit I don&#039;t know if he just doesn&#039;t like me or what? His feedback is 99.6% the highest I could find. I thought he would be a safe bet but all hes done has stalled me. I don&#039;t get it??? I sent him an email the truth is half the order isn&#039;t for me its for a well lets say friend and now they think I ripped em off and took the money. I sent him an email to his tor&nbsp; email address in a last ditch effort truth is I would much rather worth this out and make us both happy but we will see I guess. One thing is certain I need this shipped today or I&#039;m going to someone else cause I just can&#039;t make him wait anymore.

				yeah his vendor page said he&#039;s swamped with orders as of 5/31 and would be an extra day or two. my order thursday hasnt been marked in transit yet which is unsually slow for j1m1th1ng but i&#039;m not worried. the good thing about j1m1th1ng is he usually only puts his orders as in transit when they are actually in transit !

				ok nothing better to do today so gonna update again&nbsp; but anyway his profile is updated again, but now it says 4/31? odd. <br /><br />4/31 This has been by far our most high<br />volume sales week ever. Yes shipping is running a day or two behind as are my ability to get back to your pm&#039;s about why your package has not shipped as fast as we wished. We are shipping at a faster speed them ever before but sales have grown even faster. We are looking into several options as to how to best expand.<br /><br /><br />he pretty much just took out the part about going into stealth mode and added a couple things i guess well have to wait and see what happens

				I wanna post a question so bad but I can&#039;t not without revealing exact packaging but I did receive something strange with nothing that I ordered inside I hope thatâ€™s not my order. It&#039;s really quite bizarre. I wrote to him and asked if he knew anything about it?? I don&#039;t think it is though unless his transit time was not accurate that would be overnight.<br /><br />Still where in the hell did this come from??
