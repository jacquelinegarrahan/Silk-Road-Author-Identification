				i used to smoke alot of weed maybe a half ounce every 4 or 5 days, lately ive taken a break idk why just dont feel like smoking all day every day, molly was my favorite, then again almost everyone loves molly, ill still do that maybe every other weekend, coke doesnt really affect me, more of a body high than anything, and it doesnt last long so i got over that after a few months, i thought lsd was fun but my emotions are all over the place, dmt was cool but crazy, i finally tried 25I-NBOMe a while ago and thats the only drug that i think about now, its such a blast. if you havent tried it yet i highly suggest getting the 1mg blotters from righteous, you will be in awe to say the least, and hes/shes prolly one of the nicest vendors ive talked to on SR, they also are very stealthy and the product gets to you fast, no lagging on their part i was stoked this week when i opened it to find i got an extra 100 tabs, made sure i said thanks a ton and i couldnt believe the hookup, its crazy because ive bought alot of M1 in large amounts and been shorted, but ive bought just 100tab orders from righteous and he doubled my order this week for free! this is why i love SR, everyone is so fucking nice! well most everyone ha

				Never liked weed, it makes me stupid and lazy and I can&#039;t stand it.<br /><br />My favorites are tied with DMT and MDMA, with LSD being a close 2nd place. I don&#039;t do any drug daily.<br /><br />I&#039;m experienced with the following compounds:<br />2C-C<br />4-HO-MET<br />Methylone<br />2C-B<br />5-MeO-DALT<br />MDMA<br />Mushrooms<br />5-MeO-MIPT<br />Ethanol<br />2C-P<br />2C-E<br />25i-NBOMe<br />LSD<br />Hydrocodone<br />JWH-210<br />JWH-018<br />25c-NBOMe<br />DXM<br />THC<br />Ketamine<br />6-APB<br />Butylone<br />DOC<br />DOB<br />Tramadol<br />Cyclobenzaprine<br />Diazepam<br />DMT<br />2C-I<br /><br />DMT takes the winner for overwhelming amazing experience, and MDMA takes the winner for unmatched euphoria, amazing sex, and guaranteed mood lift. (MDMA + Mushrooms comes close euphoria and sex wise though)

				On a side note, I&#039;ve never smoked or eaten DMT.<br /><br />I&#039;ve IV&#039;d it (hits like a fucking train) and I&#039;ve IM&#039;d it which is my preferred method to take DMT, but I only use high grade DMT fumarate in distilled water for this. I don&#039;t like smoking chem..

				I am lookin for a new fave.<br />I want to try X again.<br />I did it once 1 hit at a club but I was shit faced drunk and dont remember anything.<br />Just like doin coke when shitfaced falldown drunk a waste.<br /><br />But I am not sure about X for a guy.<br />This chick in the (hardcore techno and industrial) club bar area was trippin on X and she was coming on to me and was so forward I was taken back abit by it. As I am not rich and famous.<br />At the time I did not<br />realize X does this. <br />If I was someone that wanted to take advantage of someone it could have been easy. But I had a girlfriend and was just in for a few and moving on.<br /><br />&nbsp;I saw her talking to this guy earlier and I thought she may have came with him.<br />I said to him did you come with this girl? Someone should keep an eye on her she is out of it.<br />he just looked at me and said nothing and walked away.<br />This was the guy selling the stuff LOL.<br /><br />This girl could have been abducted by the one she gravitated to like me a stranger.<br />Not a good thing in the town I was in or anytown for that matter. I felt like I should keep an eye on her but I had to go. So I guess another guy with time and a place got the time of his life. This girl was hot too.<br /><br />Is DMT like X and which is better.<br /><br />Whats the Limit to take with X so you dont become another person.<br /><br />Does DMT knock you out or is it a down type high?<br />I know it goes back to the 60&#039;s but never done it or that I can recall.<br /><br />

				Maybe it&#039;s not my favorite but I think it&#039;s an underrated drug, LSA. Crush up some Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds (I usually do about 8) and eat them. Smoke some weed so your stomach doesn&#039;t get upset. You won&#039;t trip balls but they are an excellent stimulant and just psychedelic enough to be functional and tripping at the same time. Go for a bike ride or a walk in the woods, aren&#039;t too many better ways to spend an afternoon.

				I love a real genuine snowball......pharmaceutical cocaine + diamorphine hydrochloride, but sadly the pharm. coke&#039;s out of my reach, so I guess it would have to be a snowball of pharm diamorph, or good quality No. 4, with some top quality cocaine HCl.<br /><br />After that, I&#039;ve never quite been able to resist what they used to call the &quot;poor man&#039;s snowball.....iv methadone + iv dexamphetamine, [meth even better], and for a real cherry on top experience.....add in some iv valium].<br /><br />Very dangerous, I know, but lovely as fuck.<br /><br />If I&#039;m in a completely different frame of mind, and thinking of hitting the hills &amp; woods for retreat &amp; meditation, then gotta be a 200mcg genuine LSD experience, [with a stash of diazepam or Xanax in case a fast exit is needed].
