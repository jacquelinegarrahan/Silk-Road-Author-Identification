				&nbsp;Ok, I read the post nomad stickied at the top so I&#039;ll take this chance to ask some questions not in this post though, later. I&#039;ve been on the road for a while but of course I don&#039;t know everything. Too me the kind of questions i want to ask remind me a bit like rules 1 and 2 of project mayhem, and there is a reason you don&#039;t ask questions, it can give away things we don&#039;t want out in the open. and since I&#039;ve been here for a long time I have always felt stupid asking for help when i can research most of it on my own. Plus I usually got trolled for being ignorant of this or that. I remember way back I was practicing and learning PGP encrypting normal messages to my vendors and my vendors jumped on the forums to complain about having to decrypt 2000-or-so bit encryption for pretty simple non-sensitive information like &quot;can you do a split strain bag&quot; or one time i asked in a PGP message wether or not someone was going to re-up soon and should i wait for them instead of going to another vendor, sounds rude but it actually was just because i liked the vendor and wanted to give him my business instead of going with some unknowns who might be sending me lower quality in comparision to his. It was pretty hilarious to watch the forums knowing they were talking about me. And yes i stop encrypting messages after that, and only encrypted my addy when placing an order. Lols was had by all<br />

				I say if it is very sensitive information, like when a vendor is re-upping, then go ahead and encrypt it, or other sensitive information. Like dates and times or other things i can think of a million things i wanted to encrypt before messaging the vendor. If the vendor gets irritated well that&#039;s on them, if they don&#039;t have a while to just decrypt messages... I understand it can be annoying in certain circumstances because i can think of a few ways a vendor would stay fully anon but just check his status... anyway getting TMI here let&#039;s just leave it at.... We will carry them, kicking and screaming, and in the end they will thank us.<br /><br />[Last part moved to new thread since it is a question]

				gracias nomad, read the vendor page i should have remembered that. although none of the vendors i have used have specified this, maybe the best thing to do is read their profile page and determine how paranoid they are, I&#039;ve dealt with a few paranoid vendors, others more laid-back. Encrypt sensitive info for the paranoid ones. i think a lot of vendors and veterans of SR would agree exncrypting normal messages is pointless... but... I guess i like to be paranoid too, better safe than sorry
