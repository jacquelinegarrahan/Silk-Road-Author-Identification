				Hi and thanks for reading my question. I keep reading how people are afraid of getting ripped off by vendors and how ppl get anxious about losing their bits when deals seem to take forever to arive. Like I said, I&#039;m old and confused; how is it you can get ripped off if your coins are in escrow? I thought that was the point of escrow....protection.<br /><br />If I order, don&#039;t FE and the goods are shipped with tracking doesn&#039;t that protect me from an dishonest vendor? I&#039;m okay with losing out if my order gets picked off by authorities, that&#039;s not the vendor&#039;s fault and I think I should bear the loss there...I mean, I took a chance, the vendor did her/his work properly.<br /><br />But, if the goods are never shipped and Vendor is a rip artist and tries to say it was shipped but tracking evidence is non existent, then can&#039;t I just refuse to release funds....and automatically be entitled to get my coins back. That&#039;s the part I don&#039;t get...why would their be any problem for escrow to just release the funds back to me?

				AFAIK, it&#039;s up to SilkRoad itself to handle these claims. I&#039;m sure they use their best judgement to determine how to handle each case. If you have a no-show product &amp; they&#039;ve had 10 other people also contact them about the same vendor in the past 2 weeks, there&#039;s probably a good chance you&#039;ll get most or all of your coins back.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re the only person to report the vendor in months of perfect service, they&#039;re more likely to assume that it just got lost in the mail, rather than the vendor simply not sending it.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m relatively new to the Road myself, about 5 months now. A vet may be able to expand on this/correct me if I&#039;m totally wrong.

Never do that. Even very well-respected vendors have been known to not ship if it&#039;s already FE&#039;d. What you&#039;re doing is telling SR that you have already received the product. That doesn&#039;t put you in a good position if it doesn&#039;t show up. &quot;Hey guys, I know I already told you I&#039;ve definitely got my order....turns out I didn&#039;t&quot;. Not much to argue on your behalf there.

				Thanks, Authbyma, appreciate your insight. But, if the vendor uses tracking isn&#039;t that proof it was sent? I won&#039;t be using vendors who don&#039;t use tracking. How can a scam vendor get his money out of escrow, if the deal was clearly never shipped because there&#039;s no tracking evidence. <br /><br />I guess really what I&#039;m asking is how the hell can a scammer get money out of escrow if I refuse to release and report him instead as having no proof it was sent, again, for lack of tracking evidence? <br /><br />Merci

				I&#039;m not entirely sure how tracking works, but would it be possible for them to actually send out product with tracking, &amp; then scam a select other few? If SR gets a complaint, they could show the legit tracking info that did get through to others.<br /><br />Actually, as I type that out, I think it would be pretty easy to prove that the shipment was to a different address than yours. Not sure.

				People lose their money because the finish early, some trust a vendor who they have used a few times and think they are pals, they are obvioulsy not and get screwed.&nbsp; Other newbs&nbsp; (like I was last year) are desperate for some goods and if they are finding it hard to get BTC they may go outside of escrow and get shafted (as happened to me).<br /><br />stay in escrow and you will have less problems, you could insist on tracking and you will have even less problems&nbsp; but you may find the vendors willing to do this are less.&nbsp; Some vendors don&#039;t want to go into premises with cameras so as to get tracking (they would rather pop it in the post box annon. outside) which is fair enough IMO.

				Quickfundinggroup needs a karma point taken away.&nbsp; He has been posting that garbage all over the place.&nbsp; It&#039;s not germane to the conversation.<br /><br />Don&#039;t FE....I don&#039;t know why vendors request it, it&#039;s a red flag...most vendors are not hip on tracking either....only after the fact, if your package never arrives, will they reference the tracking number.&nbsp;
