				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I enjoy taking oxys very much bought as is well known, they are quite expensive... Has anyone experienced smoking opium? How does it compare to oxy or hydrocodone? For some reason, I can&#039;t even smoke pot anymore without having some sort of retarded anxiety so that would be my only concern is like, upping your heartbeat for instance. Other than that, is it similar in the feeling you get? Like the euphoric and lazy, floaty high?<br /><br />I definitely don&#039;t want to get into heroin or something like that because I know myself and wouldn&#039;t be able to stop... Before I knew it I would probably be sucking dick on the corner:\<br /><br />Thanks for any and all replies

				First off let me just say that I always took Vicodin and I&#039;ve only smoked opium a few times.<br /><br />That being said....NO. Opiate medications are MUCH stronger than the opium you would smoke. After using vicodin regularly, I barely noticed the effects of opium.

				yes but&nbsp; there is a big difference between oxycotin and oxicodone.&nbsp; I think opium has been so rare before SR here in the&nbsp; US that it&#039;s purety was probably shit, if not outright SOAPIUM.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have only tried Tramadol before so I can&#039;t speak on behalf on opiates, but oxycodone is way better than opiates, at least tramadol ^^

				Like other guy said, depends if you mean oxycodone or oxycontin. Most opium is probably a little less strong per average dose than oxycodone. Oxycontin is one of the most powerful opiates around, and is stronger than a lot of heroin. Since heroin is super concentrated morphine derived from opium, it stands to reason that opium would be way less potent than oxycontin. The difference between opium and opiate pharmaceuticals is comparable to coca leaves vs. cocaine. However, from experience I know that, combined with some quality weed, opium can really knock you on your ass for a few hours! <br />

				Oxycodone is different from opium in that it is a synthetic opioid.&nbsp; Oxy is much more potent, however the opium poppy contains other psychoactive compounds, such as caffeine.

				FYI, oxycontin, roxicodone and percocet all have the same active ingredient which is OXYCODONE aka &quot;oxy&quot;. Vicodin/lortab/norco is HYDROCODONE. So there isn&#039;t any difference whether or not poopypants means roxi or OC/OP or percocet. That being said, opium doesn&#039;t feel like oxy and having a tolerance will only make you need to take more but you&#039;ll still feel it if you take enough. It would be most comparable to morphine since it&#039;s the main alkaloid in opium... <br />What&#039;s good with opium is that you can easily grow some yourself and get free opium. 1000 seeds is like $5... If you have a big garden you won&#039;t need to spend money on oxy anymore :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">however the opium poppy contains other psychoactive compounds, such as caffeine.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It&#039;s Codeine not caffeine, and there&#039;s also narcotine, narceine, papaverine and morphine (main alkaloid).

				This reddit user wrote a quick rundown of some common opiates. By no means exhaustive but worth a quick read to know the differences.<br /><br />[CLEARNET]<br />http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/15639b/different_opiates_how_they_feel/
