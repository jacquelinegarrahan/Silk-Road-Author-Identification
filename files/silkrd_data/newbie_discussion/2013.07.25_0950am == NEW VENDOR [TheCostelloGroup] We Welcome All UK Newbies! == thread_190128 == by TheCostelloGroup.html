				NEWBIES, what&#039;s up?<br /><br /><br />We are new vendors offering UK2UK with some of the finest, top quality narcotics on Silk Road!<br /><br />We are giving out samples at the moment on our forum review thread, you can have a look at that here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=190125.0<br /><br /><br />Also take a look at our vendor profile, we are offering all of our products dangerously cheap [ dangerous as in, OMG I&#039;m going to buy so much and use it all and that can&#039;t be good for my brain&nbsp; ;) ] as an opening promotion to help establish ourselves. <br /><br /><br />How does a gram [you&#039;ll always get it overweight] of MDMA for 18GBP sound? Or 10 grams for 120GBP? Good right!<br /><br />That&#039;s not it! We are also offering 175ug-185ug hits of LSD for about 5GBP, or you can buy 5 [you&#039;ll get 6, I throw in extra] for 24GBP? Even better!<br /><br />How about Mephedrone? You like that? Well everyone likes Mephedrone, so of course you do! One gram is about 8GBP, and ten grams is about 60GBP!<br /><br /><br /><br />All of our deals can easily be found on our vendor page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/df18856a04<br /><br /><br />What are you waiting for people, come and get some of your favourite drugs from the Costello Group! &lt;3

				Why is your MDMA that color? Do you know if its 83.4% pure? I presume made from sassafras? If not what were the precursors?

For years it was all that you could get in the Uk, that&#039;s why you&#039;ll hear people say &#039;Brown Sugar&#039; a lot. <br /><br />Its roughly 80%, and yes the precursor is safrole oil.

I&#039;ve often wondered why some batches of MDMA from safrole turn out dark and some turn out crystal white. I guess it might be related to the crystallization speed or sublimation technique. 80% is a good purity for non pharma grade MDMA.

				I ordered 5 tabs of Lucy to share between a friend and myself for a very reasonable price. communication with Costello was friendly and prompt, making a first time buy very easy. The product arrived very quickly UK2UK in excellent stealth packaging. <br /><br />The product was very good, and we tripped heavily for several hours, enjoying the outside regardless of the weather. as the acid began to wear off we each had our first experience with DMT bought from another vendor, which served as the peak of an enjoyable day. <br /><br />Costello will likely see more business from me in the future, providing an excellent purchasing experience. 5/5
