				7/24/13 UPDATE: the miscommunication I had with JMB was made worse by my overreaction. I WAS NOT SCAMMED by this vendor. we got our wires crossed. we resolved it in the end. I had no intention of unfairly tarnishing his/her rep. I honestly thought the worst, and it still worked out for the best. <br /><br />I&#039;ll keep coming back to JMB if s/he&#039;ll have me.<br /><br />______<br /><br />so I know I&#039;m SOL at this point, but I guess this just serves as a warning and watch out to others. I followed JMB&#039;s instructions. Purchased the RELoadit card, sent over the pack # and waited for my coin. Not two hours after sending I log back onto the road and I notice that JMB has canceled my order and not credited my account. <br /><br />this feeling f-cking sucks. lesson learned. <br /><br />...not a n00b, but still with so much to learn. <br /><br />KP

				I got scammed out of hundreds earlier this week by G GATZ.&nbsp; Truly truly sucks.&nbsp; Both he and JMB were highly regarded on SR and the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know not all BTC vendors are scammers but, because SR does not support these transactions, I&#039;m convinced SR is not the place to buy BTC.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t many (anonymous) alternatives but there are some.&nbsp; Check the thread on the Security forum if you haven&#039;t seen it.<br /><br />Again, sorry to hear this.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing my best to be the zen master this week.&nbsp; Deep breaths, etc.

				have you checked the balance of the card since the order was cancelled? you don&#039;t say anything about that. JMB could just be out of BTC right now and thats maybe why he cancelled. the money may still be on the card if you haven&#039;t checked. don&#039;t be so quick to jump to conclusions and slander a trusted vendor without knowing/stating all the facts.

				@ macaroni agreed about jumping to conclusions...<br /><br />i&#039;ve just messaged JMB as he replied to my rather pissy message after I thought I was scammed. Here I was laughing at hypochondriacs on the forums the other day. Blarg. The irony isn&#039;t lost on me at all. I&#039;m going to go check the card, be contrite if/when this is settled and I was in the wrong. <br /><br />

				I have used JMB before and have found him to be an awesome vendor.&nbsp; Very professional.&nbsp; If your order was canceled it is probably because he is out of coin or something on your end.&nbsp; Just because he canceled the order doesn&#039;t mean he stole your $

				I would like to just add my two bitcoins to this thread if I may...I completely understand the anxiety people must feel when handing over hard earned money and having to sit on the edge of their seat HOPING the coins come.&nbsp; I have worked long and hard here on SR to build the reputation I have and I have NO plans of compromising that.&nbsp; <br /><br />To clarify, a pgp message was submitted by OP that could not be opened.&nbsp; I had to message OP to resend his pgp message.&nbsp; The second message I received, I was able to open and read successfully, but it only contained a code...The type of reload was not specified...nor was the amount.&nbsp; I need to know all of these things because some reload companies require the amount before funding an account AND I need to know how to disperse the money....As OP stated, I did get a rather &quot;panicked&quot; message from him with a few choice words including the &quot;F bomb&quot; and &quot;stealing&quot; lol.&nbsp; I do not steal from anyone...EVER.&nbsp; Once it was clarified that the reload was a REloadit brand, I was able to verify the funds and transfer his coins. <br /><br />Calling someone out as a scammer is a huge deal....not everyone reads all the way through the thread to find out that it may have been an overreaction...so I really do hope he comes back and changes the title!!&nbsp; I would also like to add, that once he could get past the panic, he was actually a pretty cool kat to work with.&nbsp; Thank you in advance OP if you kindly change the wording of your thread title : D

				Glad that both parties worked things out. JMB has an outstanding feedback record. I was skeptical that he would all-of-a-sudden throw that away to binge-out on money that belonged to a customer.<br /><br />I may give JumboMonkeyBiscuit some of my business in the not-too-distant future.
