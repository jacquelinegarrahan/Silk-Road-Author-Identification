				So normally I just go through bitinstant.com to send my coins by doing a cash deposit at Wal-Mart.&nbsp; However, I just realized that sending to a bit coin address is no longer an option...&nbsp; Did they update the website and take that option out?&nbsp; If so, what are some good alternatives for bit coins?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.
