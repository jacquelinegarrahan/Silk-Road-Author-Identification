				As Suggested, I did message support twice, but I can&#039;t get into my account for any answer they may have written back. This is absolutely maddening. To make matters worse I just checked the mail and received a very nice &quot;gift&quot; from a very respectful vendor and now the most important thing on my mind is releasing his coin to him. This guy is absolutely amazing when it comes to &quot;RC&quot;s. The best! I do not deserve free drugs , nor will I take any until I can get word and more importantly his coin to him. I am surprised this subject has not come up more.I feel so fucking lost and don&#039;t know what to do. Is there anyone who&#039;s job it is to look after the well being of it&#039;s vendors and it&#039;s buyers who actually care about getting their vendor&#039;s coin to the in a timely manner. Whatever fuckwad responsible for this attack has done a good at eroding our trust in one another, fucking up good buyers stats. If i sat here for 30 minutes I could probably come up with a long fucking list that would be truly heartbreaking and and make me wanna fucking puke! Thank you to the men who have answered this, though i feel it&#039;s a shame some of these issues are not in the fore front of our bored and drug free minds. I can be a prick at times, but none of this is truly how i feel towards any of my brothers and sisters on the road, yeah you&#039;re fuckin&#039; a right! I am just looking for some very important answers friends... THIS IS NOT A JOKE! Please give this one more chance and read it through, hopefully someone will see how very important it is. Not just to me, but to all of us all individuals.&nbsp; Thanks, Superjoint.<br /><br />PS...I AM VERY SORRY&lt; I AM SO FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW&gt;....

				well first off dude. auto finalize will release the coin to em so you shouldnt be worried about that, what you should be worried about is the auto finalization that will be on your buyer history which will inhibit you from buying from trustworthy vendors!!!<br /><br />- The Weeknd<br />

				Autofinalize has been disabled while the site is under attack.&nbsp; Similarly, neither vendors nor buyers can access SR, so we&#039;re all in the same boat here.&nbsp; There&#039;s nothing you can do right now, and nothing that needs to be done.&nbsp; You can&#039;t sign on to finalize your order, but the vendor can&#039;t sign on to do anything with the btc either.&nbsp; So, no need to worry - the vendor knows that the site is down/under attack and is aware that no one can sign in to finalize orders.&nbsp;

				More importantly, I usually place orders on Sunday&#039;s to ensure timely delivery within the week. Now with everything down, I am wondering which vendors sent their packages as usual on Monday to keep customers happy even though finalization may be delayed. They would be the true heroes.

				Something is telling me that there will be a lot to deal with for all vendors/buyers when it comes to trusting one-another after this attack. I&#039;m sure there will be something that will be put in place to help all buyers involved. Perhaps resetting stats to before the attack etc. A lot to deal with however some people have reported getting access for maybe 5-10mins at a time over the past 24 hours. All we can do is keep trying until we get a window of which we can finalize. Feedback isn&#039;t important right now, that can be sorted once the attack has been dealt with. As long as we can get to the finalize button!
