				Hi guys and gals, If there is anything rawer than a newbie I am it. Just wanted to ask if I buy BTC from Bitinstant using cash deposit to bitcoin address, can I have it sent to my SR account (deposit address)? Appreciate any answers. <br />PS Everyone on SR seems to be very nice and respectful, I wasn&#039;t sure what to expect but I&#039;m really pleased.

				Can&#039;t vouch for bitinstant. My preferred BTC trader does though. They ask for a deposit address in which u supply your SR BTC unique code/address. If bitinstant doesn&#039;t, send to your wallet then to SR.

				I&#039;d look for a different option if I were you. Bitinstant has been going downhill for a while and is having quite a bit of issues as of late. Seems to be hit or miss, with some people still not having their BTC after a couple of weeks, while others are reporting no issues. Personally I quit using them several months ago, but if you do some searches you can find a lot of people having problems.

				It shouldn&#039;t matter if you use a wallet or your SR account address.&nbsp; &nbsp;As thomas jefferson once wrote, All bitcoin addresses are created equal.<br /><br />Theoretically it&#039;s completely anonymous too but some people prefer to use one or two middlemen anyway (desktop wallet, bitcoin fog, blockchain wallet, etc) just to add a few more layers of protection.&nbsp; Personally I don&#039;t worry that much about it.

Plus the transfer fees are quite annoying. My first deposit was just a few dollars short from the price of the product I wanted to get due to fees. I still got it, but had to wait 2 days for btc to raise in value.

I can see why though, it&#039;s pretty simple to use as it&#039;s set up. Probably overwhelmed. some of the alternatives have problems too. Mt.gox wants all kinds of verification and I sublet so I don&#039;t have what they want. I&#039;ll keep looking, thanks.

				I understand where your coming from, I&#039;m in the same boat. I went this way; opened up a bitfloor account, did not use my &quot;normal&quot; name. Then I did a P2P xfer using Cap1360. I&#039;m still waiting for the $$ to be available. I know it was picked up by bitfloor. Once I do that, I will probably use bitfog, then send to my SR account. I know there are lots of other ways to get this to work.<br /><br />Also, if you dont mind me hitting this topic, I did the pgp key and all. I tested it sending back and forth to another email account. Anyone wanna test to see if it really works? I hope thats not a breach of etiquette? I see once you get above 50 posts you can put your key in a forum thread, I have a bit of ways to go. Anyway, lemme know if you want to try testing it, I will share my key.

What I did was a Bitinstant purchase but going through Blockchain. From the time I left CVS (after doing the ZipZap thing) to the text message I got from Blockchain was 5 minutes!! Couldn&#039;t believe it. The only thing that makes the $ not instantly ready for a purchase is the wait for SR to post it to my account. And BTC value went down during everything so I actaully sent more to my SR account than I deposited in Blockchain. Of course it could have gone the other way but still not much because it all went so fast.
