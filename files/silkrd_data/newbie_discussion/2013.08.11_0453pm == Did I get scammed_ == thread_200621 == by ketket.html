				A few days ago I purchased 10G ketamine from a guy called Ketman (marcel) I was asked to FE because I was a first time buyer (friends refereed me to marcel) and it was supposed to show up saturday (yesterday) but didnt, why could that be? I live in Denmark by the way.

				Never FE early unless your willing to lose that money. I&#039;ve got burnt on my 3rd deal and it was all in escrow but the Vendor basically burned me and saying he sent but never did. My point is there&#039;s way too many vendors on SR that if one won&#039;t accept you cause of low stats then move on to the next one. I just went with that vendor cause his prices were cheaper but in the end it isn&#039;t if you never get product.<br /><br />&nbsp;You might pay a little more but you&#039;ll have a better position by keeping the whole deal in escrow and if anything goes bad it can be resolved in resolution center. I guess at this point all you can do is contact the vendor or maybe ask your friend that you ref you to him to contact him.

				Just because you didn&#039;t get it yesterday doesn&#039;t mean he scammed you. Depends on where he&#039;s located, as well. Could just be very backed up. Rule of thumb is to never FE, though. &amp; now you know why for obvious reasons. I&#039;d give it another day or two. If by then it hasn&#039;t come and the vendor hasn&#039;t contacted you back, try resolving it

				He can&#039;t resolve if it comes to that because that&#039;s not even an option that he can select as once you finalize the deal is done. Hopefully it&#039;s just a delay in the mail or the vendor forgot to ship it till later.

				Hopefully so. I don&#039;t know why someone would want to start ruining their vendor reputation, either. Is it a domestic shipment? Could just be taking longer if it&#039;s going through customs and other parcel services

				Thanks for the reply guys, he is shipping from Germany to Denmark and yeah I was dumb and I really can&#039;t afford another order atm if im out $360 just because it either didnt get sent or won&#039;t show up, hes rated in top 3% of the vendors tho with over 300 transactions and 99.6% feedback.

				That&#039;s like the vendor that scammed me.. he had over 300 transactions and 99.9% rating over 3 years. Fucker still scammed me just because I was mouthy with him from the beginning actually he was just a sarcastic prink when I asked some questions as it was only my 3rd order and $300 is a lot to me anyways. But ya wait a couple more days and if it doesn&#039;t show then talk to the vendor but be super nice just in case he didn&#039;t send it or is trying to scam you then if you get it you can tell him to suck it, lol.

				I can&#039;t say that I have ever dealt with him. I&#039;m going through all his feedbacks and it seems like a lot of canned responses but overall ppl seem happy and get the product. Some reviews say long transport and one review says:<br /><br />Product received within 48 hours but not crystal as advertised, powder instead which is definitely cut - clearly selective scamming going on here to new buyers with less than 10 feedback, watch out for this seller - you have been warned<br /><br />That kinda concerns me but can&#039;t jump to a conclusion based on one review

				You weren&#039;t scammed, at least we can&#039;t say yet. Shipping (especially overseas!) can be a very big gamble. I&#039;ve had packages arrive domestically in the USA first class in 3 weeks, and I&#039;ve had Canadian packages arrive first class in 4 days. There&#039;s so many variables, just wait a little while longer. I&#039;m sure you&#039;re going to be fine, good luck. :)

				Did he actually say it would come saturday? Or were you guessing based on his estimated arrivals? Don&#039;t forget sometimes the ETA is in business days, which don&#039;t include the weekend or holidays. I also saw he only requires FE for certain amounts for new buyers.

				yo, i&#039;ve dealt with marcel before and found him to be a stand-up guy selling a serious product, i highly doubt he would stake his reputation on scamming you, give it some time, i&#039;ve ordered express from Spain to Ireland express which is supposed to take 3 days but took over 14, sometimes the post is just a bit slow and theres nothing you can do about it, i&#039;d give it longer before you go shouting scam, if it hasnt arrived in like 3 weeks within europe then i think you can safely say it won&#039;t, also have you attempted to message marcel? he may still provide a refund even though you fe&#039;d, finally not to be captain hindsight but that was a pretty stupid thing to do if that was all your spare cash, in the how-to guide of silkroad they state quite clearly that you should start small and work up, test your address and shipping before going balls deep,&nbsp; maybe ordering one gram as a starter would have been a good idea, getting the FE out of the way on a minimal financial risk order.

				no worries, good luck on the road, waiting for packages is something u&#039;ll have to get used to, sucks at times especially when they take longer than they should, i&#039;ve been sitting in my house for about 5 days straight waiting for packages and the wind would blow the mail-flap and i&#039;d hear it up stairs and come running down, only to realize that the wind was fucking with me, the cheeky bastard.

				It may suprise you to find out that not everyone on the road is out to scam you, I&#039;d say most sellers have been a buyer at some point or know exactly how you feel.<br /><br />Sellers who care enough to have a good reputation usually do take care to provide good service, to regular customers and newbies alike ;) Be patient :D

				right, so what day did it say sent on? and where do you live? and when did it say you would have the order by? by the sound of things the only help you need is in relaxing and stopping scratching, hounding after your k order, like if its been less than 10 days you really should just chill and wait to see how it pans out, otherwise ask Marcel how long before he issues a refund after an order and then wait till that time and even then its down to marcel being sound for you to get anything back but yeah theres not really much anyone can help you with otherwise, even going to mods won&#039;t do shit they will just say tough shit for finalizing early

				well then thats an unfortunate lesson then my friend, look at it from Marcels opinion, the very reason he asks for FE from new accounts is cause of people setting up numerous new accounts to scam vendors, although you still haven&#039;t answered, how long has it bee since it was shipped?

I&#039;ve also seen way too many people leave feedback that say something like &quot;never came and vendor isn&#039;t answering, but leaving a 5/5 to not damage my stats.&quot; Point is, people are really really hesitant to give anything less than 5 and it&#039;s making the rating systems pretty useless.<br /><br />moral of the story: don&#039;t finalize early and give rating true to the actual experience<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think most people will look through at least some of the ratings.

				Yes I would feel like an ass but how can I even be sure he shipped the product he keeps saying that its ME that could be a scammer ill qoute him here.<br /><br />&quot;Yes you could be a scammer. It is the most common type of scamming on SR: A person sets up a new account, buys a product, pretends it didn&#039;t arrive and demands a refund. Then they do it again from another account. That&#039;s why my rules exist for new buyers. That&#039;s why all vendors have similar rules.&quot;

				I&#039;m a newbie as well; I placed 2 orders about 18 days ago, and the first one came in days with no problem. The second one, blotters, have yet to arrive (the vendor has been around a long time and has a great reputation). I am really hoping I didn&#039;t get scammed.

				He might have loyal customers but I am certain that I have fallen a victim to selective scamming as I was new and dumb, lesson learned and will NEVER use again.

				Sorry to hear that ketket, Its a shame as In real life IMO, The ketamine game is about the most honest out there, i.e. good product, on weight, decent dealers etc. Nothing like the coke/h game.<br />Bare in mind the possible postal system error though, however, I can see your point of view and will think twice before using him again, <br />As a personal reccomendation, I would try the K queens or Technohippys K, they were both of excellent quality racemic, just like it used to be, took me back 10 years nearly!

				I am a noob, so I may be speaking out of turn. But from perusing the forums I am getting the impression that it is always a better practice to purchase within your own country whenever possible. It seems to help cut down the variables. I wish I was more knowledgeable so I could offer better advice. Good luck and peace.

				i&#039;ve lost around 450-600 usd over the years since march of 2012, either scammed by vendors (mercury44) and couple other selective scammers<br /><br />or lost packages (juergan2001) (legitimate vendor) <br /><br />but all in all i&#039;ve learned from my mistakes and its been smooth since

				@FlamingMind I&#039;d say it is a safer route to order from your domestic country vendors, as you have more on your side that it hasn&#039;t got lost via shipping<br />

				yo, was you order shipped on July 22nd by any chance? <br /><br />could still show, to quote Marcel<br />&quot;07/08 - Just a heads up to any kids sitting in the resolution centre who&#039;s packages were sent on July 22. For some unknown reason, there have been massive delays with that mailout. I keep giving up hope, thinking I&#039;ve been the victim of a large intercept but then low and behold one shows up. 100g turned up to Denmark today (it usually takes 3 days Germany to Denmark!!) and 5g to the USA yesterday. So basically sit tight for now and hopefully your pack will EVENTUALLY arrive. Apologies for the inconvenience. It&#039;s the weirdest thing that&#039;s happened to me in almost a year on SR. &quot;

				Why judge if you don&#039;t know what happened? You will never know if he send it, if customs got it, if it got lost, if the mailman had a great time with your Ketamine, you just do not know. So it is not fair to say you are scammed. He has a overall very good reputation, I hope I will ever have...

				Sure it can be lost or someone has stolen it, but it too can be selective scamming.

				It seems so hard for me to believe that Marcel is a selective scammer. I&#039;ve done business with him a few times, always ordering a small amount, and he was great about replying and even helping me with an order when I messed up my PGP.<br />Not to mention, his product was fantastic each time.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about this :/

				Id even be happy accepting a 25% refund tbh, as I FE&#039;d and it was my first purchase but he helped me through the whole process but he won&#039;t even offer ANY kind of refund even when the amount purchased for was 3 BTC.....

				I feel like 3 btc is a bit of a risk for a first time buyer...maybe he selectively scammed you...but you were sloppy. I doubt he did and I plan to order from him anyway...and it probably won&#039;t be for 3 BTC.
