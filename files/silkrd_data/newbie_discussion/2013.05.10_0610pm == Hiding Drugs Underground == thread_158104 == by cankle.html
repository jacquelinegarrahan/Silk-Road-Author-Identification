				I&#039;m thinking about burying my stash underground (not far underground just a foot or two) because I&#039;m worried about LE knocking on my door soon. Does anyone have a good method to bury something and keep it moisture/damage free for like a month?

				Seal them in MBB, or put the stuff in a tupperware and add drying agents they put in shoes and stuff (sillica beads), even enough rice will do the trick.

				eh, I&#039;m mostly paranoid because I have some mushroom spore syringes and if I get caught with growing supplies, that&#039;s automatic jail time. Don&#039;t really want to risk it even if I&#039;m being hyperparanoid

				You could dry your stash very dry, pack it in a mason jar and put a lid on, place mason jar and a chemical to absorb water in a zip-lock bag, then bury the zip-lock with the jar and stash inside.&nbsp; However when you come back in six months, your drugs will be completely ruined, and there will be water in everything.&nbsp; Hope that helps!

				if you live in a location with grass find a stepping stone or something that way theres not a bare patch in your yard.<br />buy a tin safe from walmart ($15) and zip lock bags. id bag it 3 or 4 times then vacuum seal it ( or just a few extra with duck <br />tape sealing the mouth of the last bag) then put it in your little safe. then put your safe in a garbage bag and then in another and bury away!

				There&#039;s a risk involved in anything. It&#039;s another type of suspect movement to be seen digging holes in your yard, so make sure you have a &#039;dead pet&#039; story ready for the neighbours. Hopefully that&#039;s not *also* illegal. If I were you though, I would just keep it all organized and professional looking in your home. Take pics. Make yourself appear scheduled and on the ball. Then if they arrest you, publicize yourself as a hard working individual and strengthen the cause of the road!<br /><br />LONG LIVE DPR!

				Matey, don&#039;t even bother trying to hid stuff in your back garden, if they have intention of coming in your home for whatever reason, you can almost guarantee that they will be equipped to find in, even if buried underground. I know.

				I&#039;ve had more than a 20k stash buried for over a year now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this before and it&#039;s always fine.&nbsp; I use large strong tupperwares, then I put it in a garbage bag and tie a knot, then repeat it with another garbage bag and bury it a good 15 inches.&nbsp; I use a steel rod to penetrate the ground and find my stashes after such a long time.&nbsp; I do this with money, valuables and drugs.&nbsp; I slightly penetrated a tupperware lid with the steel rod once but everything was fine when I dug it up.&nbsp; I just didn&#039;t use that tupperware again.

				Many survivalists swear by large diameter PVC pipe with glued-on endcaps.&nbsp; It&#039;s still detectable by GPR, but if you bury it way out in the back 40, far from your house, they will have to spend a hell of a long time looking.&nbsp; Depending on what you&#039;re storing, you may want to throw in a dessicant or oxygen-absorbing packet as well.
