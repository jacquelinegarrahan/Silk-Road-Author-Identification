				This is a good place to start: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br />If you browse around the forum there&#039;s a lot you can read to learn about SR. I am not a BTC getting expert so I can&#039;t help you there.<br /><br />But, since you&#039;re new here, let me tell you this one thing that&#039;ll save you from a lot of heartache---- Never EVER never Finalize early. That is, release money to vendors before you receive your product. No one will want to help you and you won&#039;t get your money back and everyone will laugh at you for not knowing the basics.<br />Welcome aboard!

				Bitcoin source: http://localbitcoins.com/ is my personal preference.<br /><br />Best standards: Learn how to use GPG4Win (or whatever platform you are using. If TAILS, which is highly recommended, it comes with GPG and Kleopatra, a front-end GUIfied interface for it).<br /><br />Learn enough about how OpenPGP works (and how public-key cryptography works in general) to understand how to encrypt and decrypt messages in more than just email, in clipboard (copypasta) text and TXT files.<br /><br />Learn enough about Bitcoin and Tor to understand the limitations and flaws of the software and security models to avoid serious compromises of security, including anonymity.<br /><br />Learn enough about network and system security so you understand how to manage risk.<br /><br />Since you are not new to the scene, I probably don&#039;t have to explain how to protect yourself offline, with burn phones, disguises, circuitous indirection to throw off any pursuers, etc.

				Go to LocalBitcoins, and find someone who will accept cash paid in to their account. That way the only trace of you ever buying is the CCTV cameras in the bank, and unless you are buying kilos on here and get caught the police are not going to go snoop through hours and hours of CCTV. Enjoy and stay safe&nbsp; :)
