				If a person is only a buyer of small amount of drugs for personal use, can you still be a target to be under surveillance?<br />A friend of mine doesn&#039;t want to get out of her house because she knows she&#039;s being watched but she needs to buy btc with her cash so she can get her drug since she&#039;s an addict.<br /><br />Any opinions/suggestions will be considered thank you

				If you guys aren&#039;t doing meth or any other drug like that then maybe she&#039;s being watched.. But what would she have done? If her addiction is to meth then she&#039;s probably being paranoid.

Mainly because it will cost thousands to do this type of surveillance, it will then take thousands to go to court, then a lot more thousands in Jail Times, all to get a convictions of an Addict get her fix to stay well................ It wont happen, even if it did the Media would fucking love that story to further show the War on Drugs should in itself be FUCKING ILLEGAL.<br />Anyway to prove it was you who ordered Illicit goods is also adding to the thousands, making the state pot 100k+ to get a conviction for hundreds. Anyway you can either take my advice or not, I could be wrong, I am not your Legal Adviser. But good luck.<br />Peace&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The fundamental flaw with paranoia is that you never know what events were transpiring before that person became paranoid. Know what I mean???<br /><br />For example, lets say you have an older cell phone (like not a smart phone) and every once in awhile when you dial someone after there is a click sound. Before being paranoid you don&#039;t even pay attention to it. After you become paranoid you think that little click sound could be when a program from your cell provider has now started recording your calls. Then you being to think that they are recoding your calls because you used certain keywords that a program would recognize and then grouped you into &quot;record this person&#039;s calls because they could be a potential law breaker.&quot;<br /><br />(Side Note) On you tube there are presentations from the hacking convention in Las Vegas. Where a software engineer who helped to develop these key word type programs talks about how they are used. Really interesting stuff. Basically they do collect a lot of information, but depending on the cell provider you have the rules for how police get this information is different for each carrier.<br /><br />If this person sees people sitting in police like cars watching her house, you should totally verify this. Don&#039;t just take his/her word for it. Paranoia distorts everything, you think the whole world is paying attention to you. If you do visit this person and you don&#039;t see anything out of the ordinary then your dealing with a nut. If you do see police types in unmarked cars then this person should just flush everything, end of story. I would also put distance between myself and this person because they might compromise yourself.

				If there is still a question of &quot;should I still buy&quot;, then the addiction has taken hold. Which in turn tells me that paranoia has also taken hold. If it was me, and someone was watching me from outside my house, I would be very polite, knock on their car window, and say this &quot; I and my community have noticed you here for a while and it is starting to feel like an invasion of my privacy and safety. &quot; Make them aware that you are aware and not someone they can bully around. If it persists, just tip your hat at them and wave. They will get tired of watching someone that is producing no results. Which I should hope you aren&#039;t giving them. 8)

				I don&#039;t mean to sound like a dick, but I shouldn&#039;t have to remind everyone that purchasing through SR is a federal offense do to the transportation of illicit substances through the mail...

				Saying &quot;she knows she&#039;s being watched&quot; sounds very suspect to me. The whole point of LE surveillance is so the subject of investigation doesn&#039;t know that LE are watching them. Care to share any insight into how she &quot;knows&quot; she is being watched?&nbsp; The likelihood that your friend is under LE surveillance as a small time &quot;user&quot; is very slim. If she is dealing to support her habit, that&#039;s a whole different story. If she receives a lot of packages in the mail that have drawn suspicion, they would probably just get a warrant to open one of the packs and then either seize it or set up a controlled delivery. If the amounts she&#039;s ordering are small, personal usage numbers, it&#039;s very unlikely LE would waste their time on her. That being said, you didn&#039;t provide enough details for anyone to give you a very accurate opinion on what&#039;s going on. I would suggest your friend is either paranoid, or selling to pay for her habit. To think she is under active surveillance for strictly &quot;using illegal substances&quot; is not rational.
