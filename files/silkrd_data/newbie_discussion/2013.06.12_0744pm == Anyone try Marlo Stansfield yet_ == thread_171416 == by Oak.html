				I have , his shipping is fast . It was a while ago and I forget exactly how many days but I remember it was pretty quick. His prices are very good, especially for SR . <br />Quality??? Pretty decent, to me it seemed like pretty good regular street C, a bit speedy n jittery for my taste, but the quality/price ratio is real good. There&#039;s better on the Road but it&#039;s a decent deal for the price.<br />With that said, I think Marlo turns over batches pretty quick so I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if what is selling now isn&#039;t the same shit he was selling back when I used him. I&#039;ve never heard anyone say his C sucked though.

				Thanks for your reviews! Nod sounds great and I was just about to pull the trigger.......the price got me! I&#039;ve been gone a few months and it seems a whole new batch of vendors are here, I used to get from DRPVMD, his stuff was great, alas he has been gone for the past few weeks. Maybe I will give Nod a try soon.....special treat!

				I&#039;m surprised Marlo fucked ya. Most people are really happy with his services . His C aint the best I&#039;ve had, but it was in no way what I would consider a scam , it was real, just a little on the jittery, speedy side for me.

				He&#039;s a vendor taking a beating right now and is trying to spew some hate my way. At first i thought maybe he got a package from another vendor and got mines mixed up. But when i seen that he didn&#039;t contact me,&nbsp; his name and shipping to area. It all made since.
