				Actually scout, I hate to say it, but that&#039;s NOT true.&nbsp; While I logged on last night, I saw EVERY board was covered in spam and the account that had spammed it had used nearly 3 pages of the newbie discussion forum to be able to post in the general forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />I created this account so I could post in the newb forum and offer help since they were all spamming pointless posts themselves to get their 50. I figured they may as well get some help if they&#039;re gonna be posting like rabbits hump. Another mod must&#039;ve come in and cleaned it up before you saw it, but it was bad.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I back you&#039;re decisions 100%, but it&#039;s not as effective as you would like to believe. :/
