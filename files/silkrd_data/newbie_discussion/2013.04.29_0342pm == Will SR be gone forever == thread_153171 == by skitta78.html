				How much effort will someone give to something that is just going to fail again the next day. Im losing hope. I have so much invested in SR and I cant access a single cent of it. If SR is up and running again in 12 hours then down again another 48 I am having doubts it will ever come back. I dont undertand computers and networks in a technical way so I dont know if there is a permanent fix to this present problem or if its just never going to stop. Meawhile shipped orders are not being finalised, pending orders are not being shipped and no sales are being made because mo can get in.<br />Im asking for genuine expert advice here. Ive had enough faith in SR to invest as much as I have but I have no clue how this event will if ever unfold. Does anyone know for certain that SR will overcome this and operate as normal anytime soon. Can SR build protection to prevent this happening again. Is there anyone who understands what is happening and knows it can be fixed?<br />I just want to know facts not faith or hopes. Will we survive?

				I can feel your pain.&nbsp; :-[ I guess I belong to the lucky ones whose orders were put in transit right before the attack.&nbsp; &nbsp;;) <br /><br />just give DPR and the crew some time to fix it. I am not that tech savvy to point it much further but as it was said it&#039;s a (or was) DDos attack (which I thought can&#039;t be done on Tor - correct me if I&#039;m wrong) it&#039;s not that simple to defend against these attacks. you could ban incoming server request while blocking suspicious ips but if they attack with thousands of bot pcs each with a unique ip it&#039;ll get hard to handle!<br /><br />for further information check this official topic from DPR:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153045.0

				I would imagine that given not only the financial investment that DPR has made, but also his personal dedication to the cause of freedom, he will find a solution.&nbsp; Even if he had to pull the site down for a month or 6 and reprogram the whole thing, it will be back eventually.&nbsp; So don&#039;t fret!

				I&#039;ve been using SR for a while now but have never used the forums until now. I&#039;d just like to throw in my two cents and say I don&#039;t think I could possibly be more pissed off at the cocksucker who is attacking this site. Even if you&#039;re one of those fucking morons who thinks drugs are evil, you MUST be able to see that SR almost completely eliminates drug related violent crime. By attacking SR, you&#039;re putting people&#039;s lives in danger, deaths of drug users are on YOUR conscience. I really hope the person doing this is just some pathetic child who has nothing better to do with their time because the alternative is something much darker. I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s too much of an over reaction to say that this person completely deserves to take a fucking bullet to the skull for the evil he is raining down upon completely innocent users of this site.<br /><br />Fuck you who ever you are, asshole.

				If you have taken any time to read DPR&#039;s philosophies or other posts on the forums then you will should faith that he/she will not abandon the site. You think you have $$ to lose? Consider the billions in transactions fees not happening right now. DPR dedicates relentless energy and passion into helping people help other people. We will prevail.

				&nbsp;8)My Mates! Hoy! Hoy! Pick your spirits up off the deck! Hard as it is WE will come out on top! Why? Because Light, Truth, Justice, Love always Prevails over darkness, deceit, injustice, and hate! Is there money involved? Absolutely Yes! Yes, but this is about a whole lot more than money, this is about Doing the Right Thing, shining light on a twisted, deranged system that has remained veiled in darkness and secrecy at the expense of millions of good human beings for far too long! The insane drug laws and the political, social, and economic systems they create in the U.S. and most of the world,&nbsp; have wrongfully existed for going on 100 years. This insane system has done far more harm socially and individually than they could ever do good in a million years! We are all casualties of the War on Drugs! We must correct this bizarre system that eats up our resources, both economic and human. We show what is right by&nbsp; claiming and owning our right to fair trade, as we mature adults see fit; and this demonstration is invaluable! We must not give in! We must not bow down! We must do what is right by disobeying laws that are wrong! Righteous Non-Violent Civil Disobedience worked for Dr. Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi! Welcome to the final Civil Rights Rebellion! If these attacks are found to be from a competitor seeking to establish themselves in this market, obviously motivated by nothing other than the desire to make money; ANY ATTACKERS ON THE SR SHOULD BE TREATED AS PERSONAL ENEMIES&nbsp; OF US ALL- ATTEMPTING TO STRIP AWAY OUR HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; DIGNITY AND ENSLAVE US FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL GAIN!! I DO NOT WISH TO DO BUSINESS WITH ANYONE SUCH AS THAT, AND I WILL BE NO ONE&#039;S SLAVE!&nbsp; I believe we will all be pulled tighter together rather than splintering apart by adversity! These are the times that try people&#039;s&nbsp; souls!
