				Not really, dude.&nbsp; SR isn&#039;t a McDonald&#039;s drive thru.<br /><br />If you want to be a junkie thru SR, you better plan ahead.

				First of all, I&#039;m not a fucking junkie.<br />Second of all i wouldn&#039;t be in this situation if vendors would get back to me within 48-36hours of me contacting them.&nbsp; Its not like Im going to be sick or some shit. I just have deadlines.<br />Third of all, SR is a fucking McDonalds drivethru. Open 24/7 that&#039;s the whole point.<br />So if you just want to flex nuts and sound cool, do it somewhere else. Helpful comments only.

As an IV drug user who considers myself a fairly respectable member of this community, I find this pretty fucking offensive.<br /><br />Anyway, killerb, I&#039;m actually in the process of buying BTC right now with a MoneyPak. The vendor&#039;s name is LibertyCoin. He&#039;s online right now and ready to do business, just pop him an email: libertycoin@Safe-mail.net. Everything has gone smoothly so far, he just sent the BTC to my account and I&#039;m just waiting for them to show up now, but I have no reason to believe they won&#039;t. He&#039;s super helpful, fast and cheap and accepts MoneyPaks no problem.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a few links:<br /><br />LibertyCoin vendor profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/784e7ef494<br />LibertyCoin review thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178368.msg1297854#msg1297854<br /><br />I&#039;ll be adding my review to that thread as soon as everything goes through, which I&#039;m sure it will. I was referred to him by a friend here so I&#039;m sure he&#039;s legit.<br /><br />**EDIT** Can&#039;t believe how fast I got the BTC, and I think it might have actually even been a couple dollars OVER (might have something to do with SR&#039;s exchange rate being a little off, not sure?) Only took less than 30mins from the time I sent the MP number and he received the funds for the BTC to show up in my SR account! VERY happy with this vendor, I&#039;ll be adding my full review soon!
