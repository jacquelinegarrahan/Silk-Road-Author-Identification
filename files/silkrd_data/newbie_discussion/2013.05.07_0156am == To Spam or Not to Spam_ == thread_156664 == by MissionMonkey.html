				Obviously being that this is my first post, I&#039;m new to this whole thing. I&#039;ve been doing my research, learning the methods and feel totally fine with continuing that path but I thought maybe it&#039;s better just to ask basic questions to get to my 50 posts or is it more common practice just to spam? Reputation seems to be vital here so If spamming hurts my initial reputation then I have no interest in that route. However 50 posts does seem like a lot... Suggestions?

				Not sure about that!&nbsp; A tricky question!&nbsp; I&#039;m working on figuring it out right now, in fact.&nbsp; But I think my plan is just to go through the newbie forum and post wherever I have something at least a little reasonable to say.&nbsp; It seems to be a happy medium between straight spamming and taking a month to find really great responses.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Contribute to legit questions/discussions.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want people to get the idea that you are a spammer, even if it is only to get your post count up.&nbsp; People can search your old posts and the last thing you want them to see is the same thing posted thirty times, especially if you plan to try to be legit here :P&nbsp; At least that&#039;s my two cents.&nbsp; I&#039;m new but I&#039;m avoiding spam because I plan on being here a while and want to be taken seriously.

				Awesome. Thanks for the feedback I guys. I guess we&#039;re all new here. At least in this post thread anyway but I&#039;m glad others feel the same way I do. The spam posts are kind of discouraging.

				Just joined the forums and I&#039;m feeling compelled to find a reason to post in any thread i can contribute to.. Starting here I guess. My suggestion would be to just provide opinions and advice that are honest and logical to the topic at hand, even if it&#039;s only reinforcing ideas that are already over the thread.

				Man, the only reason I created an account was to reply to this one guy who was harassing one of the moderators. I just wanted to say that the guy harassing Libertas was coming off as a dumbass the more he posted. DRUGS DRUGS ... I NEED DRUGS&nbsp; ..... NNEEEEDDD DRUGS RIGHT NOW. NOW!! NOW!!

It&#039;s on the stickie (&#039;pinned&#039; topic) at the top of this page. Your posts can ramp up more quickly and you will be learning something that you need to, if you haven&#039;t already.<br /><br />Ask whatever questions you need to ask. And if you are the OP, you tend to write more anyway as you tend to respond. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Why do you recommend that thread in particular? I still have a bit of learning to do on the PGP side of all this but I don&#039;t understand how that thread would get my posts to &quot;ramp up more quickly&quot;.
