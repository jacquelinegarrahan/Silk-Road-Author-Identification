				I placed an order on the 21st, and it shipped on the 22nd. I believe I finalized on the 21st as this is a new account (because lost my old account information.)<br /><br />It arrived and I believe it is an RC and not real LSD. I&#039;ve ordered a M&amp;R test kit but I&#039;m waiting for it to arrive. How long do I have to leave feedback before the option is taken away from me?<br /><br />If I won&#039;t have long enough to leave appropriate feedback, I&#039;m considering linking to thread here where I discuss the issue in detail and show pictures of the blotter and test results.

				You can change your ratings and feedback at any time.<br />Just click Account-&gt;View Feedback<br /><br />Just note... vendors can see your feedback.&nbsp; Being honest is the best policy, and most vendors would prefer if you would take up an issue with them directly before messing with their feedback.<br /><br />That being said, I have no sympathy for assholes who scam RCs off as LSD and feel they get what they get.<br />Now if they didn&#039;t know themselves, I would feel a little less bad, but you have to know what you&#039;re selling before you sell it.<br />

				Agreed. Psych Users need to take extra precautions because of RCs!<br /><br />If you are new to the psych scene, then you are STRONGLY URGED to invest some coin in drug testing before drug consumption. It probably won&#039;t be the death of you to consume RCs, but people have committed suicide because of strong dosage and mixed expectations.<br /><br />I&#039;ve consumed shrooms, mescaline, LSD, DOC, salvia, nutmeg, DXM, and a few others (not DMT... yet). I have consumed most of them by myself. I know what happens. I know how my mind works. I am not a danger to myself (when on drugs... sometimes suicidal when NOT on drugs). These are consciousness-modifiers. Your carpet could become snakes! or Spiders! It&#039;s fun when your fucked up, but not if you panic.<br /><br />Be safe.<br /><br />Sidenote: after consuming DOC, I lost my sex drive for at least 7 days... it&#039;s still kinda fucked up. I had an orgasm at least once everyday before DOC. Now, it&#039;s the first time in my life that my libido has waned.... I guess thanks... but it&#039;s weird....
