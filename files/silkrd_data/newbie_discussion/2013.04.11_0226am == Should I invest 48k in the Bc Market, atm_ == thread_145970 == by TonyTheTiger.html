				Invest to make money? Poor idea. Unless you are a currency day trader or have some sort of inside in the BTC market, I would not. Had you asked a few months ago, I would of said sure as prices have been mostly stable, but right now is the worst time to invest. <br /><br />Go look up the 5 stages of a economic bubble to see what I mean. And put your money in a money market account or RothIRA. Well unless the money is dirty, in that case invest away.

				Seemed to correct itself a bit today.&nbsp; Also it really seems like more of a bubble than anything else.&nbsp; &nbsp;Long term? Absolutely not.<br /><br />But at the same time, if you have great timing and luck, like for example had you bought that two weeks ago and cashed out yesterday?&nbsp; Holy shucking fits.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that&#039;s also like saying how you could clean up at poker with x-ray vision or a time machine.<br /><br />Buying that much at once might be a problem also.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most places will only accept up to a much lower max so they don&#039;t get investigated for money laundering.<br />

				I would recommend investing just about 5-10K in BTC. I wouldn&#039;t put 48k in one basket. Plus if BTC really explodes as much in the future and becomes the most widely used currency on the internet as people think then 5-10K invested now will be more then enough to make you a very rich man.

				Alternatively; invest that 48k into a bunch of coin-mining computers and you will probably come out ahead in the long term. I would bet money (or not rather) that some institutional investors have already caught onto the BTC idea and are making a run on the market for all its worth.

				You&#039;re better off spreading that money across many different and unrelated investments not just BTC. That strategy minimizes your risk greatly.Today was an example of the volatility an investor faces trading BTC. Imagine having that cash in the exchange and a DDOS hits. You can&#039;t do anything... you&#039;re fucked. But if you&#039;re a risk taker and looking for high returns go for it. Just be prepared to either be overjoyed or devastated.

Funneling large cash amounts through another currency could easily be construed as a form of tax evasion/money laundering. Eventually you have to get that money back into some real-world currency (unless everyone starts using BTC in the future ;D ) and that will bring up some large red flags, especially in the amounts you are talking about. Remember, Al Capone was brought down by the IRS, they are some vicious mofos when it comes to getting paid ;).<br /><br />But hey keep fueling the bubble, us day-traders will make some easy money :D.

				If you really want to play and you can lose ALL that you play with, then buy $10K and hold that. Buy another $10K and trade that, like buy now and sell whenever you make 20%. Then buy back in after a drop of 20%.<br /><br />Modzi

				Bitcoins wasn&#039;t made to be an investment thing. It was meant to be a currency, so if you are planning to use those bitcoins you are buying with your 48k please do so. If those 48 k is of a currency of any value and your plan is to use them here, I hope you are sharing your drugs or at least distributing them in some sort of way and not using all on your own. Even tho it is a bit fun my bitcoins I basically have paid nothing for is skyrocketing in value, I would rather have it to be a stable thing so it would be easier for me to use and and buy more. But hopefully the bubble will burst soon and people wouldn&#039;t buy them just to get some easy cash.

				As others have said, Bitcoin isn&#039;t something you should look at as a personal investment. Economically there are some serious inherent issues with Bitcoin in terms of long term stability.<br /><br />If you believe in the currency, believe in the principles behind it, and want to &quot;invest&quot; in the idea, go for it, and be prepared to be in it for the long term.
