				I&#039;m new to SR but have spent a lot of time on the site over the last couple of months. Before I ever made a purchase I researched my sellers, learned the rules, and made a firm decision never to FE. I was patient and found some fucking awesome vendors: East Coast Fuego, shroomin1, Caligirl, Cosmocanyon to name a few and life was good. Great communication, great customer service. Sadly this week, some prick messed up my utopia.<br /><br />His (or her) name is Cryptokeeper. He sells bitcoin. Since Bitinstant went down, I&#039;ve been looking for new sources. My Coinbase wallet is &quot;pending&quot; and my local guy is on vacation. So I decided to check the road. Crypto looks really good, many, many, many positive feedbacks- pages worth of buyers raving, so I figure I&#039;ll give him a try. I sent my info and moneypak number and gave him the 24 hours he said it would take- at the longest. Most buyers claim it was only a few hours.<br /><br />Nothing. Started messaging. Not being a dick, just wondering what&#039;s going on...are u there? I figure fuck this guy I&#039;ll just deposit my moneypak into my paypal account and find another seller. Got there and Paypal informed me that my moneypak was worth zero. Motherfucker already had my money.<br /><br />Everyday since then I send emails pleading with him to send the btc or give me my money back. Messages are not even read let alone answered. Then I find out that the only recourse I have is to report him. That without the escrow system there is no resolution process.<br /><br />Not that it really matters, but that money was for medication. I am a single Mom with a slipped disc and a torn rotator cuff. I live in a state that is so anti opiates that you have to be damn near dead before you get a script bigger than 20 vics. So the pills I buy on the road help me so much. With the pain managed I can actually do things with my kids. It&#039;s summertime, I wanna go hiking and swimming with them. I wanna live like a semi-healthy individual. He only stole 215.00 from me but I don&#039;t make a lot of money, and that&#039;s a lot for me. So I won&#039;t be able to buy my meds for two weeks, and it sucks. Actually, it makes me cry.<br /><br />Not that I think my story makes me better than anyone else. If you are on the road to get high you should be shown respect and not ripped off. I know crypto has done this before, and I suspect he is targeting newbies. You know, if I auto-finalize that will be on my stats forever, but it&#039;s the only way to leave the horrible feedback that he deserves. Or I cancel it myself, report him and never buy btc on the road again.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t decided what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for stopping to read.

				Not familiar with Crypto, but that sounds lame. <br /><br />This shouldn&#039;t happen either way, but it makes it even worse when it was medication that you really needed, not just looking for a good time<br /><br />I hope this gets resolved<br /><br />Screw the stats if you have seller that know you are trustworthy, leave a&nbsp; review.

				wow that is no good. I messaged him the other day looking for a way to get bitcoins. He did message me back, but it was after I had already got BTC on localbitcoins. Next time submit your moneypak code in the address field when you go to &quot;buy&quot; the coins. This will at least allow you to leave him a negative review if he screws you over.

				<br />Just get rid of him...he&#039;s been scamming on here for quite some time...I&#039;ve never been scammed by him (Knew better), but I know many people who have messaged me saying that he has.<br /><br />His feedback is laughable, his 0% commission is also laughable.<br /><br />Admins, please ban this guy so these newbies stop getting scammed by him.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

If he doesnt mark your order in transit and just cancels you wont be able to leave feedback. Also I saw you talking about waiting for the order to auto-finalize? Like I said until he accepts the order you wont get to leave feedback no matter what you do. This is how MP--&gt;BTC vendors get you, they have you enter the code in the address section and then cancel your order. All of their feedback will be fake 5/5s about how fast and awsome the vendor was. Wish SR would make btc vendors put a certain number of btc in escrow. Stick to the know traders when it comes to buying coins. Good luck

				Just use other reputable vendors outside of SR.<br /><br />There are plenty on other forums that even accept MP in exchange for BTC.<br /><br />Happy searching.
