				I can&#039;t see the site going anywhere permanently. The admin will adapt the site and continue, and DPR has stated that this is his intention. There have been some very creative and constructive ideas suggested in the community for how to overcome this attack and improve the reliability of Silk Road too, so in the long term this may even turn out to be the start of a new and better site.
