				Hey, what&#039;s up guys.<br /><br />I&#039;m organising an acid trip for me and a group of very close friends next week. I&#039;ve taken acid with an old colleague of mine once before and it was amazing, we took a Mayan and a Hoffman each and had a great trip. My very close friends have been inquiring about my trip to space and i think i&#039;m ready to take them with me on my second trip, but i was hoping to get some advice from you lot first.<br /><br />My colleague was a little more experienced than I so i think i felt really at ease when we were tripping together, and my biggest fear is that the responsibility of my friends is going to unsettle me and i&#039;ll float down the river towards a bad trip. What kind of advice do you have for the daddy of the group taking some newbies on their first trip?<br /><br />I&#039;m going to order enough for two tabs each, but start off with one - probably ~140ug, nothing too hardcore (or expensive). We&#039;re going to have a sitter staying with us who won&#039;t be taking anything and he&#039;ll have a car he can drive in case of emergency.<br /><br />We&#039;ll probably be starting our trip in the morning and staying inside for most of the day. I&#039;m going to order a couple of benzos to take in case somebody takes a turn for the worst, and to help us get off to sleep in the night. I&#039;ll probably get some diazepam: has anybody had any experience taking this on the come-up?<br /><br />I guess ultimately i&#039;m just worried one of my friends will put themselves in a difficult position and i&#039;ll be unable to deal with it as i&#039;ll be trashed on acid. I&#039;ve been thinking of simple things like keeping mobile phones in a drawer away (i found it SO easy to fall into a bad mood when i was using it) and having some computer games to play (simple, happy stuff like Mario Kart) to kind of reinforce a positive state of mind. On top of that i&#039;ve got some trippy visual images and things like that, and i&#039;m very much looking forwards to the feeling of mind expansion Lucy brings once more.<br /><br />What kind of safety tips have you guys got to ensure a nice, trouble free trip? Anybody got anything they really like to do while on acid?

				Everybody needs to know upfront that whatever they&#039;re experiencing, it will ends at some point. If you stay indoors, prepare a nice playlist, some funny things to do (for me, it&#039;s drawing or writing), in a place where you can feel safe, with people you trust.

				i&#039;ve never seen a first timer have a bad trip, everything is so new that they just don&#039;t go done that road. i would just relax, trust your sitter, and go with the flow. even if they do start to freak out your not so trashed that you can&#039;t empathize, just say so calming phrases, (it&#039;s going to be fine, your just high, calm down, we&#039;re here for you, your not bothering anyone: usaully works for me) and distract them with something shiny ;) just don&#039;t be worried about them, or it can fuck up your trip. i assume they know what they signed up for, hopefully your not just spiking the punch. if you do roll tape!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if you really want a novel experence i suggest &quot;candy flipping&quot; aka lsd and mdma.&nbsp; good times

				With a good group around you it&#039;s usually pretty easy to talk each other down if you end up with a bad trip. I stay pretty clear headed on psychs, though (even on 700 ug cid I can still play a decent game of chess, lol). Something that comforts me to have around is Trazadone, though. Within about 30 min. taking it the trip dies away. I believe any SSRI will do. Even if you don&#039;t take it, the escape route is a comfort (especially with a lonngg mescaline trip).<br />Works with MDMA too.

				Shouldn&#039;t be any bad times with a first-timer as long as they&#039;re in a good frame of mind to start with. I&#039;ve always believed that someone witha a positive outlook at the time will have no problems amongst friends..and if possible OUTSIDE too where they don&#039;t feel hemmed in or anything. That said:<br /><br />speed helps clear the halucinations, other than that a calm, dark room, pacing around eating oranges of kiwi fruit. The Vit C helps bring a trip down or mellow it out nicely.<br /><br />They&#039;ll be fine :)

				Hey mate, Welcome to the mad world of LSD. First of all i would like to reccommend that you take them on a night when your feeling good and want the night to be better, Enhanced if you will from the state it&#039;s already in. <br />If it is your friends first time tripping be aware people change on LSD , the people that are the most keen can sometimes become the most paranoid. And its more the different state of mind that confuses people. <br />Nobody wants to be the one person looking after everybody when your trying to have a nice LSD episode. So here is my tips. <br />.Dont do it with any showoffs. They always try and be &quot;the big man&quot; and it backfires badly on them when they cant handle it.<br />.LSD &quot;bad trips&quot; can be avoided if you just think positive, Have a good time, try doing some deep breathing, watch or listen to something that makes you happy, Stay positive and enjoy the experience. <br />. Dont go out unless you feel comfortable enough. It might sound fun but going out on LSD when your not used to it can cause serious problems due to the headtrip,egodeath and hallucionations. <br /><br />Message me if you want any detailed info.<br />Im going to be stocking clean potent lab tested LSD soon so become a fan on my profile to keep an eye out :)

				Well I normally stock up on xanax in case shit goes bad. I have never in all my years of tripping had to use it but it is nice knowing you have some sort of escape route if a bad trip happens.

				Thanks for all the posts guys, it&#039;s great to feel the love from the community! I&#039;m probably going to invest in some Dalai Llamas - has anybody had any experiences with these?<br /><br />*EDIT*<br /><br />Doing some research and i&#039;m finding that 200ug (advertised on the Dalais) is a bit strong for a first trip. What&#039;s a trip on something that strong like? :)

If you make a purchase with me i will have no issues at all writing you out my best advice on safe consumption. <br />This is a fairly strong dose, However it is not uncommon for certain people to take double this and more. It all depends on you, If you are of a good mind then this would be a strong trip yes, But enjoyable. There is no &quot;exact&quot; dosage for LSD for a first timer. <br />My prices will be more than competitive and very very fairly priced. <br />If you are interested please become a fan and keep an eye out. I shall have these in a week LATEST as i said,And i have no issues answering any questions you may have, And giving you a full Q&amp;A session for any queries you may have :)

				I think the idea about stocking up on a couple xannies is your best bet.&nbsp; It is a comforting thing to know you can kill the trip if it really gets overwhelming.&nbsp; Just that sense of control is enough to keep it from getting truly overwhelming.&nbsp; Also agree with being out in nature!

				You&#039;ll be fine, and probably have a lot of fun. Being somewhere nice in the woods etc is good, the worst that will be likely to happen is you might say some weird stuff your friends don&#039;t understand and roll around in some plants or something.

				Maybe you don&#039;t want to trip with a huge group of first timers at once. <br />I usually trip alone or occasionally with a friend or do a low stealth dose -75 to 150ug and go out<br />but that&#039;s just me. I find the introspective qualities of acid suitable to being on my own.<br /><br />I personally would be worried about the first timers and fussing about whether they are OK or not<br />which would likely do my head in and I&#039;d be wondering why I had bothered tripping.<br />Keep it intimate - a few trusted and secure friends and you should be fine.<br />What people call bad trips are usually just bits of themselves that they don&#039;t want to see. Do your friends understand that?<br />Have they done their own research? Is it something that they really want to do or do you want them to do it?<br />If they enter into the LSD world willingly, in a secure state of mind with acceptance of what comes they will be fine and probably have a blast.<br /><br />On less than 150ug anyway its barely tripping, its really just starting there but its a good place to start.<br />Good luck
