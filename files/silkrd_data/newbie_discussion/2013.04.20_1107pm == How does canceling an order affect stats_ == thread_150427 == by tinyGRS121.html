				Is it different if the seller cancels the order as opposed to the buyer canceling the order? I&#039;m pretty sure a vendor is going to cancel my order because he ran out of product, which is totally ridiculous. Plus, I&#039;ll get a smaller amount of BTC now since prices have went up since I placed the order. I&#039;m going to be really angry if this happens and my stats are messed up because of this guy. Vendors should not post products they don&#039;t have!<br /><br />I placed an order on April 18, and my order is still processing. I checked the vendor&#039;s page and on April 19, he wrote a post that said &#039;I apologize for the inconvenience, but I have to cancel my leftover Suboxone orders and take the listing down until I can find a new supplier.&#039;<br /><br />He hasn&#039;t messaged me or anything.

				Cancelling an order does not affect stats, refunding an order will. A cancellation assumes nothing was sent, nothing was received. You&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />I have had vendors cancel orders because they suddenly ran out of stock. It&#039;s very easy to do when you have multiple listings for different amounts (like 1/8 listing, 1/4 listing, 1 oz listing, etc). Vendors usually put their total amount divided by the amount in the listing rather than designating stock for specific listings.

				Thanks for responding, DH.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that I will get a refund minus 4% SR fees. But maybe that&#039;s not the case for a cancelled order?<br /><br />I&#039;m really pissed...it was for Suboxone, a medication I desperately need. The vendor should have contacted me immediately about the situation. <br /><br />VENDORS, please do not list products you don&#039;t even have in your possession!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				It sucks... You will get charged the SR fee unless the product was &quot;unhedged&quot; <br /><br />I sent you a PM with some info.

				My 1st order on Sr was with a Vendor that had listed the pills but didn&#039;t have them at all.<br /><br />Gowd and as it transpired over the weekend that he/she will go get it then post it so didn&#039;t have it at all! This made me so ficking angry spec as I was nervous cause of 1st purchase etc, advertising stuff you haven&#039;t even got yet WTF I thought!<br /><br />I can understand keeping it at another address, speaks volumes for the safety reasons but not actually acquiring it but then listing it to sell!!!<br /><br />So I cancelled soon as I could, I thought fick my stats since its 1st order, I&#039;ll create another account sent coins over and never looked back, <br />I scrutinies feedback now because of this<br /><br />stupid thing to do I thought tho&nbsp; :-\
