				Copied from the main rumour mill thread: <br />I&#039;ve ordered from loyalist twice now, first time it was 2.5g thai and the most recent was 10g thai and 7g blue cheese. Both times loyalist has been kind enough to send me a freebie as well, first time a joint&#039;s worth of blue cheese and this time a vial of oil. The thai is proper thai - it actually gets you stoned even if you smoke it by itself. The blue cheese is fantastic, and at this price it&#039;s unbeatable - potent in strength and smell, covered in crystals and very dense buds.<br /><br />The oil deserves a separate review! In order to smoke it, I took my penknife and, before I twisted it up, used one of the small blades to smear oil on the inside of a joint. This turned out to be a very effective method; I could taste the oil as soon as I lit the joint and it immediately reminded me of smoking high quality hash - earthy, &#039;heavy&#039; taste. The high from the oil is magnificent (I hate this word, but it really is) and I slept like a baby!<br /><br />I can highly recommend loyalist, very sound guy and keeps his word!

				would just like to drop a few lines for the loyalist... I have also bought twice now of this vendor both times i was very very happy . my first was 7grams of blue cheese and i got to say it was fucking awesome i hadnt smoked blue cheese like that in a good whhile . so as soon as i got more coins i placed an order for 14grams halfo , the loyalist also then let me know he had some cheese that was stronger so he was good enough to give me 7 and 7 split, blue and normal . the only thing was that the vacuume packaging had crushed the 7 of cheese but i got on the ball and the loyalist was more than willing to come to agreement and sort this out. i wouldnt have minded if compressed a little bit but it was mega crushed lol but these things are to be expected as new vendor but i have been told from now on the vacume sealing will be done with perfection this made my two buys very very good and made me put in a third order to try some real gold string thai and im very excited to try out. I will defo be back for more blue cheese as i always say , its one of my favourite strains and the loyalist has the best at reasonable prices compared to other vendors ;) plus one also mate&nbsp; as its uk vendors like you, i like to see coming on the scene ;)

				I&#039;m pretty new to SR with only 3 transactions so far, but I tried loyalist for the second one with 5g of Thai (came in 5.2g so he&#039;s good with measures) and the weed was decent quality and a nice buzz where I can still function and be active, but just have more fun. He even included for free a 0.4g sample of some stronger weed that I don&#039;t know the name of. That&#039;s really appreciated! I&#039;ll be buying again soon.

				I brought some of the thai in order to try a different and new vendor and was very impressed. Good packaging and a nice smoke. I am a bit of a thai fan and was impressed with this lot, it is stronger than the thai i have had from other vendors and with a nicer taste.<br /><br />Will be ordering again very soon

				Have made one order from this guy, communication is prompt and polite, which is always a major plus for me. Order was delayed because product he received was not good enough, and then when my order came had some oil included to make up for the delay. Very happy overall and will order from the Loyalist again.

				Ordered some Thai from this guy, came quickly, well packaged and a very nice smoke. He threw in a generous sample of some excellent Cheese (I think) as well. Worth checking him out if you&#039;re looking for decent weed at a decent price.

				Ordered some thai on Sunday, FEd on Monday and the weed arrived on Thursday. To be honest I am a Silk Road noob so I worried that this might be a scam given the overly glowing reviews, but can confirm this guy is 100% legit. The thai is proper old school stuff, hard and crumbly, some stems and seeds, but nothing major and a very nice, mellow smoke. Like being back in the 80s. Thanks Loyalist and sorry for naggy messages. :D

				I&#039;ve posted in the regular forum thread but thought I&#039;d put a post here to. I made an order of 28g thai on tuesday, was marked as sent tuesday morning and I selected special delivery. 2 days later still not here, i&#039;m waiting on a response from him after I asked for my tracking information. still got a couple of days but I really wanted it before the weekend and considering I picked SD, annoyed it isn&#039;t here yet.<br /><br />hopefully he&#039;ll give me my tracker and it&#039;ll arrive tomorrow I guess

				If you have made an order of Thai of any amount you should get in contact with him immediately regarding the status of your package. I would have thought this issue applies to orders placed maybe 2-3 days before 09/4/2013 which is when he first said he was having issues of the Thai he sells.<br /><br />THIS IS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM LOYALIST&#039;S SELLER PAGE.<br /><br /><br />&#039;11/4/2013 -<br /><br />Ok there appears to be a big drought of thai weed - still waiting and no joy.<br />Im lost - I got everyones addresses and also what they ordered but not their usernames - Dont know how I am going to work this but I got royale blue cheese - CURED. Let me know somehow identyfying yoursef even via your postcode if you would take 2g og blue instead of 5g of thai and 4g instead of a 10g order of thai. Let me know, if not let me know how to resolve. Many thanks.&#039;

				I have just read the latest update on loyalist&#039;s vendor page....<br /><br /><br />&quot;12/04/2013 - This is impossible to manage as all info has to be relayed to worker. SR is slow and ALL I CAN SAY IS SORRY FOR DELAYS - NOTHING I CAN DO AS NO GOOD THAI AROUND, SOME PEOPLE REPLYING , SOME NOT. THAI WILL BE HERE SOON BUT I DONT KNOW WHEN. I AM ON IT TODAY. EVERYONE WILL GET MORE THAN THEY ORDERED OR EXTRAS. EITHER OIL, SKUNK OR MORE THAI ON TOP. Sorry again, I am a new vendor and got wrangled up but I will sort it, I&#039;m a honest fella. Im probably more stressed than you as I got about 30 outstanding thai orders. and half have FE&#039;d. I keep accepting orders as the thai is coming. I assume people read my profile before ordering. EVERYBODY WILL GET THEIRS STUFF.&quot;<br /><br />My apologies for the way i have &quot;asserted&quot; myself in my previous posts......I understand that you are having problems....and must be a lot more stressed than anyone waiting for there smoke...<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I made an order for an oz of thai and although it took a while to get here, he threw in a sample of oil for free so no complaints here. The thai is lovely soft buds and a very pleasant mellow high. hopefully he can get his postage sorted and he could be a very good vendor

First order came through next day.&nbsp; Im slightly concerned that this one won&#039;t come through with the value of the bitoins changing about so much but will let you all kno if anything arrives on monday.<br /><br />From what I read on his page it doesn&#039; seem to be il orders affected, only the thai ones because of this drought...

				it is indeed, nothing in the post today, pretty disappionted, more so because since his request to FE, about 20 minutes after ordering, there has been no contact what so ever. I&#039;d be OK with no contact if I had receved within a day or two, but things don&#039;t seem right....

				Like everyone else here I ordered two weeks ago! And being my first purchase ever was dubious about FE but did anyway.<br /><br />Had just about written it off as a scam but came through yesterday finally despite going for special delivery!<br /><br />I get that the guy had supply issues but be seems legit. After 2 weeks he could have run off with my money but he didn&#039;t! <br /><br />Hang in there people, I did and eventually it came.

				I&#039;m in the same boat. Ordered over two weeks ago and nothing yet, though he was responsive to me and seemed legit in his comms, which is why I ended up FEing last week when he claimed to have sent the package.<br /><br />I suppose it&#039;s still possible that it arrives, as I did ask him in an earlier message to send it a bit later (I went on holiday earlier, but am back now). But I&#039;ll give him bad reviews if the week passes by without receiving anything. Would be a shame though, was looking forward to some of the thai and the oil.

				At least you got a response from him! He hasn&#039;t bothered to reply to me since I FE&#039;d. I&#039;m not going to hold my breath for anything to arrive this week so I&#039;m just going to have to write it off as a scam.

				ell, the very fact that he is responding to some users and not to others kinda says it all really.<br /><br />seems to be something of a selective scammer.<br /><br />i&#039;ll be reporting him once the post man has been if nothing arrives been going on too long now and not had any contact from him apart from &#039;sent recent&#039; about a week after it shoud have been sent.<br /><br />unfortunately with people like bibbsy still prepared to order off him, when there are several users who have FE&#039;d and not got anything, I don&#039;t see why loyalist would have any incentive to make good his dodgy dealings with those of us who have been scammed.

				I feel your pain mate although I have very good stats so maybe hes not a selective scammer and is just trying to take what he can before SR shut him down. <br /><br />Once I heard he is replying to some and not others I knew that there is no way im going to receive the oil so I have left 1/5 feedback and notified SR support that I believe he has turned to scamming. <br /><br />He could redeem himself if he just sent us all our orders or even a refund but as you said he doesn&#039;t have any incentive to do that because people still choose to order from him!

Look I cant tell you if order despatched or not as dont keep addresses. BUT due to all this bollox from real scammers trying to ruin my shit. I will be keeping records until the items are recieved. I have also employed one more person to take the orders and to keep these records so all queries will be able to be answered. I am no scammer, I dont need to, this turns me around sufficient money. Good feedback on huge orders but a few small orders that i scammed, yeah right. Selective scamming yeah, well I think i would have selected items of higher value. Use your loaf, you cant destroy this. xxx</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I understand his frustration if he is legit and truly trying to sort things out. But he doesn&#039;t quite seem to understand ours. There are several of us who have been waiting for several weeks. <br /><br />I for one am still holding out hope for my order and still haven&#039;t put a negative review in (even though I ordered around the 4th of april and nothing has arrived yet) due to all the positive ones coming in, my understanding of his logistical problems, and his semi-helpful replies. But at some point even my patience will run out.<br /><br />I do appreciate the steps he claims to have taken to prevent these problems from occurring in the future though.

				&#039; Look I cant tell you if order despatched or not as dont keep addresses. &#039;<br /><br />ok loyalist,<br />so, say things were getting a bit busy, or hectic, as in you were getting in orders and didn&#039;t have the stock to fill them (ie, the issues you had with the thai)<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s unreasonable to think that you might have misplaced, or overlooked a few smaller orders, in the rush and panic to make sure people who ordered thai got sorted out.<br /><br />I can totally understand how that might happen but what grinds my gears is the lack of communication, and lack of urgency to actualy sort out those who have been wronged.<br /><br />I have a feeling my patience is going to make me loose out on this one as since having him ask for my order details and address i&#039;ve not heard anything back from him. <br /><br />my fingers remain well and truley crossed but not holding my breath!

				g861203 sorry to hear your bad experience. I felt the same way in the week I had to wait for my delivery. The guy is clearly in way over his head and is probably holding down a day job too and getting wrecked in his time off.<br /><br />He has ZERO idea how to run a business.<br /><br />His responses to 2 simple questions I asked him already set alarm bells ringing in my head. He makes claims about customer service on his page but really he has no idea what that means.<br /><br />Shame, as I do like the oil but rather than deal with him again, I&#039;ll make my own.

				By the looks of his post on his page it would seem hes angry at us for voicing our concerns about our orders not arriving? I don&#039;t think he quite understands how long some of us have been waiting which is completely unacceptable.<br /><br />I can appreciate things may be a little hectic on his end but he certainly could have approached the problem a lot better especially with his comms.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently waiting on the postie to arrive so we will see if the oil comes today like he said it would.

				Guys, loyalist is OK, he took a bit of time to respond to my messages but he is not a scammer or anything. <br /><br />I ordered last week, it said it was in transit but I don&#039;t think it was as he has run out of weed, he got some more then he posted it out on monday and i got it tuesday<br />along with a gram of oil. I think he just got a bit bogged down and wanted to take the orders but maybe he was let down by someone IRL promising him thai or something. <br /><br />If you want it next day maybe he isnt the best dude but he was fair with me and I got what I wanted a couple of days late. <br /><br />His thai is good, and the oil is pretty strong, good value overall and I think he tries his best, we have to understand the pain in the arse vendors have to go through sometimes, maybe we expect too much from them!

				I am happy to say I received my order today, slightly disappointed in the packing which lacked vac sealing and a return address (my first order with loyalist had both) but at the end of the day the product arrived.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it was unreasonable to suggest that he appeared to be selectively scamming, especially when some people were receiving as normal and others were not. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t get anything extra but I ordered when the product was relatively cheap, probobly another reason I thought perhaps soething was wrong, a case of &#039;if it&#039;s too god to be true&#039; sort of thing....<br /><br />I have to say loyaist really seems to have made efforts to make amends in the last few days, sunds like he put his faith in someone who decided to take advantage of the fact.

				I ordered some thai, 5g, special delivery (£8 extra). He said he&#039;d sent it so I fe&#039;d. But it took a week. But the packaging was good, got a decent amount (more than 5g) and it&#039;s really good weed. I like skunk usually but the Thai was nearly as good. <br /><br />It was worth the wait but failure to communicate will always cause problems.<br /><br />Always contact the client all the way through the deal.<br />Always reply promptly to messages.<br />If the gear is out of stock tell the client straightaway and give them option to order something else.<br /><br />Easy said I know, I just smoke the stuff, much easier than selling it to all of us moaning paranoid tokers!<br /><br />But you&#039;ll get the gear if you order from him and it&#039;s good stuff.

				My 3rd SR order was from this joker.&nbsp; He was quick as lightening to ask me to FE, but then nothing for weeks - no response to my polite enquiries as to where my order may be, until my patience finally broke, and still relatively politely I suggested he may be scamming.&nbsp; Then I got an abusive reply from him playing the victim card, but no real apologies or anything like that. (Seems like usual charmless style) But in spite of all this he said he would reship seeing as I was such a C*%T.&nbsp; Anyway, needless to say nothing arrived.<br /><br />So that was two packages that got lost in the post was it Loyalist?<br /><br />Never had any problems from other vendors, only Loyalist.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avoid like the plague!

				Never had any issues with loyalist. Iv tried his oil, several ounces of candy cheese and iv even tried the thai. Everytime stealth, speed and esp product were all 5/5. Looking at this thread i wondered where all the good reviews are? These orders have been in the last 2 weeks mainly but stretch back to may. He should link his page here because clearly just the neg reviews are coming here
