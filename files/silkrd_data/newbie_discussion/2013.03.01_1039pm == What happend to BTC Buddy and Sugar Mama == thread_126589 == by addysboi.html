				to whomever did this thanks very much as my opinion has been&nbsp; :-X<br /><br /><br />be careful with this guy I didn&#039;t read about him on the forum till after I ordered... hours after my moneypak was drained I messaged him saying this was a test run(sent $60) and I&#039;m looking to place a big order but I&#039;m paranoid then less than 5 min later the message was marked read and my money was there... I don&#039;t trust it probably wouldn&#039;t have seen any btc if I didn&#039;t tell him I was sending big order...everyone on the forum say he canceled they&#039;re order so he probably left all this good feedback himself he seems to be a selective scammer use at your own risk

I have used sugar mama a few times and had no problems with here. Here rates are a bit steep and she can take here time but I always got my coins from here.
