				modonifil gives you extra energy. like you don&#039;t need to sleep kinda energy, but not necessary an extravert substance. Xanax works best for me, but i&#039;m an introvert because of social anxiety. if you are an introvert because you just cant find things to say, take some adderall. you will talk for hours.

				It all depends on the person but maybe a low dose of amphetamine. Modanifl can make alot of people like that aswell. Modanifl would probably your best bet because it shouldn&#039;t be noticeable at all to them bet plus it wouldn&#039;t show up on the drug test i dont think.

Most doctors will throw SSRIs at people because they have so many different effects for so many different people. They will cure depression in one person, and give the next person insomnia and give the third person headaches. But if alcohol works for you, stick with it.

				Opiates usually work very well for that. A medium dose of oxy or vicodin will still leave you functional and not make you talk people&#039;s ears off like on stimulants, while making you a lot more social. Benzos are also kind of good but IME they make me not want to talk much and makes it difficult to speak loud enough because of the sedation.. A low dose of xanax would be the best bet for a benzo. Etizolam should be good too but I don&#039;t have any experience with it. Opiates work the best for that IMO, they make you not talk too much like on speed or too little like on benzos.

Maybe you could try ritalin too, it&#039;s cheaper. If you have the money and want a good stimulant, go with dexedrine.

				alright thank you all for these suggestions. I&#039;ll definitely try some out.

It was intended for people that get uncontrollably sleepy during the day (like the opposite of insomnia).&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken it several times at work and no one is the wiser.&nbsp; It&#039;s also possible with enough hunting to find on the clearnet from one of those no prescription needed places. But beware of scams. Also a fun fact, modalert and probably other generics are manufactured in India (I&#039;m sure a lot of drugs are made in India...) so don&#039;t be surprised to see sellers located in india selling modafinil or similar.

Obviously he can&#039;t go to the doctor and be all &quot;hey, these aren&#039;t working any more can you just double my prescription plz? kthx&quot;&nbsp; Granted I have my doubts he takes them as prescribed. For example I&#039;m prescribed valium for social anxiety/&quot;panic attacks&quot; (that&#039;s why I call them but don&#039;t think they&#039;re what most people consider panic attacks) and it&#039;s 1/2 - 1 pill as needed and it&#039;s only 5mg. and they&#039;re still really cautious about prescribing it (had serax before but during one of my &quot;panic attacks&quot; valium kicks in faster).

Considering Valium script, &quot;as needed&quot; medication is a lot harder to ask for increased doses of, because you basically have to show no improvement to the extent of detriment to your daily life before they will up your dosage very far.<br /><br />Of course, it depends on the doctor too, but this seems to represent a pretty consistent attitude among MDs.
