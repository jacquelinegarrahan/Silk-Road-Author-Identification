				Hello, I am a newbie here (obviously) and just learning how to acquire bitcoins. On another thread here various websites were discussed for the UK. https://bitbargain.co.uk/ was on one of them. After completing a bank transfer for 2 bitcoins at £180, I received them in my wallet on the site. When I went to deposit money from that wallet to this account here it gave me a code to fill in. I filled out the code and it said my transfer was successfully completed. The trouble is, my account here is still being listed as 0 despite having transferred £180 into it. I worry as when I used bitbargain I wasn&#039;t allowed to use Tor with it or an encrypted website, so perhaps the fact that I sent from bitbargain (which wasn&#039;t anonymous) to this Tor-enabled website messed things up. I&#039;m not sure really, but it did say the funds had been transferred and successful so am at a loss as to what to do. Any information would be much appreciated, thank you!

				It takes hours sometimes for my coins to show up on the market. You can check blockchain.info to see if they were sent. Also if you buy coins and they are somehow associated with your real identity you should use a tumbler before sending them here.

				Phew, thanks so much small time!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I have my confirmation number that I&#039;ve just written to bitbargain about to see why it would be taking so long, but it&#039;s good to know that the funds don&#039;t always appear on here automatically. The transfer was completed using the deposit code here within seconds, so hopefully it will turn up soon. Fortunately I didn&#039;t use my real name on bitbargain so nobody can really associate it with me.

				There is no such thing as a &quot;deposit code&quot; in bitcoin. You can only send bitcoins from one bitcoin address (looks like the number 1 followed by random characters) to another. There is built in error checking so it is very unlikely a mistyped address was accepted. If you copy/pasted the wrong address then unless the recipient sends it back, you are outta luck. As was stated above, bitcoin transactions take a while to get &quot;confirmed,&quot; and the Silk Road only accepts transactions once they have received at least six confirmations, which takes an average of one hour. Sometimes the transaction can get stuck in the network for a while before it is confirmed, so give it 24h before you fret.

				Like others said, it takes a few hours. <br />You have got the transaction ID I guess, you can look it up at the blockchain website, just put it in the search and you will see if it was sent properly.

				Thanks so much for your help everybody.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just looked up my transaction on blockchain info. I made the deposit into my SR wallet 4 hours ago and so far there are 16 confirmations on blockchain. I&#039;ll guess I&#039;ll have to wait and see how long it takes to go through now and try not to worry.

				Even odder, when I go to blockchain to type in my address, the one I am given through the SR, it shows two transactions today. One going from I assume the account I bought the 2 bitcoins from at 1:30 p.m to my personal SR transaction deposit code. That now has 18 confirmations and there is a green button that says 2.00 BTC.. Then, I see above it at 3:19 there is my same transaction deposit code going to somebody else&#039;s address and it says -2.00BTC with a red button and 11 confirmations. I assume when we put our first deposit down on the SR we have our own unique transaction codes? I&#039;m curious as to why there would be my same code going to another address with -2.00 BTC on it now. Could somebody have taken money from my account while it was out there in limbo and received its final destination? I&#039;ve no idea now.

				I also made my first deposit into my SR account today and so far it hasn&#039;t shown up, although it&#039;s only been a couple of hours.<br /><br />I kept it small (&lt;2 BTC) just to test the waters.<br /><br />The TOR network itself seems slower than normal today, and SR is currently excruciatingly slow. It&#039;s been down for maintainance a fair bit in the last 24 hours. <br /><br />Others have also posted about their coins not showing up yet. But I&#039;m not going to worry, there&#039;s probably a long queue of traffic all trying to use the site. I&#039;m gonna be patient.... have a snooze..... see what&#039;s happening a bit later :)

				Yay! My coinage has manifested itself into my SR piggy-bank.<br /><br />It&#039;s just that everything&#039;s running slow today (or are we on speeeeeeed?).<br /><br />So a little heads-up to those who are waiting with baited breath and grindy teeth for their BTC to appear........ be patient. :)

				yep mine took about 12 hours, I transferred as soon as SR came up around 9am utc or whenever it was.<br /><br />This is really not something anyone should worry about if they understand how bitcoin works.&nbsp; Your transaction can&#039;t get &quot;lost&quot; (well, unless they lose the key for your wallet address...).&nbsp; (hmm on that note, has SR explained how they back up their key data?&nbsp; I assume something like that would be handled very carefully with lots of redundancy, since a mistake would be costly).
