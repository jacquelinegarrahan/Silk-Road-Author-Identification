				Recently finalised early for InfiniteSource about an hour before their page was shut down? Anyone else do the same? Seemed legit &amp; still hoping they kept their word about going post off 15 minutes after i finalised for em. Expecting meth on Monday to Aus? Or has anyone emailed him &amp; received a reply?

				InfiniteSource has had his vending privileges revoked for a number of reasons - he was scamming and threatening buyers, amongst other things. It is highly unlikely that you will be receiving any order that you placed with him.<br /><br />As you have finalised early there is nothing that Silk Road can do for you. Don&#039;t leave the protection of the escrow system - it is there for YOUR protection.<br /><br />Please see the SR Wiki here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#I.27ve_already_finalized_my_order.2C_but_am_having_problems.<br /><br />Libertas
