				Heya guys! I plan on making a review thread once it&#039;s all said and tested but I wanted to offer an update, I recieved my pack today! So many layers of vac seal! I love it. Pretty stealthy. I don&#039;t think shipping will be a problem with this seller!<br /><br />Couple of things...<br /><br />Everything looks on point!<br /><br />I got some Sour OG, GDP, and headband flowers along with the Green Crack &amp; Blueberry cheesecake shatter!<br /><br />I have tried a few and wow, shit is on point big time and some of the first real shatter I have seen here. very malleable. I likey
