				I think you are totally right!<br />ive not seen all of your counted movies but there is something rly scary out there.<br /><br />Just to sample som facts ATM:<br /><br />9/11 - sure osama ...haha<br />Fukushima - you dont hear anything about one of the biggest pollutions in mankind<br />irak/iran/afghanistan ...pff all fucking wars - they do it just for money (they destroy everything ...and take money from the bombed yountries to build everything up again)<br />financial crysis<br /><br />in the past few years the world developed as it was mentioned in that movies ..maybe with a little bit delay<br /><br />this word is about so much and such HEAVY crime ..the most people just can think about it and this is why it just can be done.

It&#039;s all about the stars, and Jesus wasn&#039;t real. They want to lead people away from religion, it&#039;s part of their agenda.<br />The Illuminati believe in a form of what many people would consider Satanism. And one of their main goals is depopulation. <br />That&#039;s why there is fluoride in the water and poisons in all the food you eat and why they keep coming up with new vaccines that are making people sick and giving children autism. Don&#039;t take the flu shot people. <br />The Mason&#039;s basically don&#039;t even exist anymore except to be a front for the Illuminati, and the people in the lower level blue lodges don&#039;t even understand what they&#039;re a part of.<br />Homeland Security is the new SS and America is walking down the same path as Nazi Germany. That&#039;s why they want to disarm the public. And I&#039;m not even a conspiracy nut.&nbsp; Just logic and facts...<br />If you like documentaries watch this one it&#039;s very informative: (clearnet) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skhd9NCseF4

				Northwoods is correct from what I&#039;ve studied. Chris Hedges says we are in a system of &quot;Inverted Totalitarianism&quot; and people are being economically sacrificed right now in really bad places of the US. The police are being militarized, and all we have left are the supreme court justices, and the states to protect the constitution. From what has been put on the news lately who knows what is in store, engineered famine and economic collapse, ufo disclosure, or mind control can all be believed if enough people buy the &quot;big lie&quot;.

				maybe paranoid too but I strongly believe that the beginning of all of this was with reagan and tatcher,<br />the famous TINA that make people stop cogitate.<br /><br />for 911 I don&#039;t know the truth about it but my opinion is that US government at least knows and let do for privat economic reason AND mind control reason:<br /><br />- designate an ennemy<br />- thinking in terms of WE and THEM<br />- giving people someone to hate and make them not thinking of economical injustice (&quot;normal&quot; people have just no idea how the little few are living and wasting)<br /><br />My hope is to stop earing &quot;we can do nothing about it&quot; &#039;cause the real power is in people brain, just we don&#039;t know it.<br />

				Yes, yes there will. But it probably won&#039;t (at first) be how you would expect it. I think it&#039;s a lot more likely that there are many groups that are pushing for more power under a central command where they can monitor your every move. This includes government, the church, the illuminati, and those communist neighbors of yours down the street. I&#039;d say the best way to protect yourself is make sure that you&#039;re in control of your own actions and be aware of what&#039;s going on around you. Secondly, and maybe more importantly, make sure you&#039;ve got a backup plan for TEOTWAWKI :)

				I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this North Korea/America thing is a conspiracy for someone to drop a nuke and wipe out some of the population. But really, it can&#039;t be healthy to get hung up on these things. I mean even if it was to happen it&#039;s not like we could do anything about it.
