				I smoke but never eat before..&nbsp; In your opinion, whats the best marijuana edible to get?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m thinking of&nbsp; getting the &quot;medical chocolate chip cookies&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />I want to be able to function and not just passout in the couch.&nbsp; &nbsp; I want to be able to do activities.&nbsp; Sex, gaming, watching movies, clubbing, etc..&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t want to be a numb vegetable that can&#039;t move or do anything for 6 hours..&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;ve never had edibles but want to try.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I function on these brownies or will they just make me drowsy???&nbsp; &nbsp;I know the more you eat, better the chances for passing out.&nbsp; &nbsp; I want to have fun on them, so if you know of a kind that is better let me know.

				The dose and cannabinoid ratios will determine what happens.&nbsp; Make sure your vendor is clear with doses per piece and maybe they&#039;ll list whether an indica or sativa was used.

				Cookies in theory should be easier through customs but not necessarily. Cheeba chews are a special product and i suggest everyone try them<br /><br />Also, making your own cookies is really quite easy if you&#039;ve got your own oven and an oz

				I&#039;ve tried Hashbean&#039;s sour patch kids and I really liked them. I like that they were individual candies you can pretty much exactly gauge how high you want to get 10mg at a time. I also have the Ghiradelli Snow White cookies from Senses but I haven&#039;t eaten any yet. I&#039;m gonna test run one tomorrow and then I plan to eat the others I ordered for a concert on Wednesday. I&#039;ll come back and let you guys know. But for now I can definitely vouch for anything Hashbean is selling, he does quality work.&nbsp; The sour patch kids come with 25 to a pack at 10mg each and I would eat about 6-7 to get a nice high going for a few hours
