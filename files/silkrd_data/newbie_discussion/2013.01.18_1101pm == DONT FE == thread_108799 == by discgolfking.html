				Have FE every time and bought from darkesspresso 3 times 1 onion and 2 elbows. Shit comes SUPER discrete overweight and on time. So if you do your research on the vendor see they are in good standing then FE, BUT if it a new vendor or someone with no reviews of product received then I would not do it.

				I think of more buyers especially new people than the sellers will require it. <br /><br />You are taking 100%&nbsp; of the risk if you FE. Doesn&#039;t sound like a smart way to go. A lot can happen other than theft. <br /><br />If a seller plays by the rules and uses the escrow system what is the risk to them? <br /><br />The seller isn&#039;t left twisting in the wind even if the buyer drops dead. His/her Funds are realised automatically.<br /><br /><br />

				I FE&#039;d on my first purchase and I was fine. Though the seller didn&#039;t require it, it would be shipped out earlier if I did.<br /><br />I don&#039;t advocate FE though, you can get scammed. But you just have to look out for who the vendor is. However as many people have learned, even if the vendor is in the top 5%, scamming is still possible. <br /><br />Look out for yourself.<br /><br />And with that, I&#039;m at 50 posts :)

				I FEd for the first time a few days ago because a reputable vendor warned me he was slow and package could take 2 more weeks to arrive. I didn&#039;t want to bother with resolution and certainly not get an auto-finalize on my rating. If the product doesn&#039;t arrive and I don&#039;t get a satisfying resolution, he&#039;ll get my BTC share of bad rep on SR and in everyone of his thread and product thread in this forum IF I EVER GET OUT OF THIS DAMN NEWBIE SECTION.

				97 already makes me nervous, unless it&#039;s on 300+ transactions over a year or more. I wouldn&#039;t think about FEing below 99/100. Ratings going below those levels start smelling of selective scamming, especially when the vendors ask to FE...

				If you don&#039;t have any buying history you might not have any choice. There are vendors that won&#039;t require it for first time buyers, but you might be limiting yourself in terms of choice. Do your research on the vendor. Don&#039;t rely only on the feedback on their sellers page, make sure you check the forums. Start off with small orders. Once you have a few buys under your belt, if they say FE you say FU!

				I agree with the NEVER FE advice but I also make it a personal rule of mine to never buy from vendors that have pages and pages of un-updated FE in their comments. I wouldn&#039;t even risk an escrow deal with a vendor like this because it just seems too lucrative for the vendor to walk off when that many people are FEing. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that I don&#039;t trust the escrow system, I&#039;m just saying I never want to get to the point of having my coins tied up in resolution.

				I was asked to FE on my first purchase. I wrote a message to the vendor about why I wasn&#039;t comfortable with it, and the vendor said it was all good, I didn&#039;t have to FE (which is good because I wouldn&#039;t have). I have not had to FE yet, and am still damn young around here. On the contrary, the vendors I have chosen have all been really fucking great. I will not FE, there is simply no reason to do so. The escrow system protects both the buyer and the seller and if you are a stand up individual that should suffice.

				I would never FE on a new vendor or a vendor who doesn&#039;t have good feedback. If the vendor reuqires FE, look at his %rating, if it&#039;s over 98% and they have been selling with good feedback over 300 tranactions I would give it a try, but only a small amount to sample.<br />always start of small. alot of people bullshit

				I&#039;m new and it seems the best vendors quite often need FE. I try to avoid it as much as possible but if a vendor has a very high rating and has been around long enough I probably will accept the risk. Just not for large purchases.

				If you have less than 5 transactions and/or less than $100 spent most vendors will want you to FE since your still relatively new.&nbsp; I know myself my first 3 transactions all required a FE but those days are long past now 8)&nbsp; One thing I can say is if you trust the vendor and you want to release the coin early then go ahead but be aware of the risks.&nbsp; I myself FE one time and my package never arrived, since then their is only one cat I will FE for and even then I only use them as a backup because if you do some digging you will eventually find someone else supplying the same shit w/o the FE nonsense.&nbsp; As for the one vendor I would FE for, I have done over 6 transactions with them and FE every time and every time I received my product quickly, and stealthily and the only reason for the FE was due to intl order.<br />TinyDot

				I think like anything, it&#039;s not quite right to say *never* FE. <br /><br />Once I&#039;ve used a vendor for several transactions and they have a generally positive reputation, I almost always finalize their transactions as soon as they&#039;re marked &quot;In Transit&quot;. Otherwise, they are having to wait to get paid for something they&#039;ve already sent. As a person who occasionally sells on Ebay, I hate the fact that I don&#039;t get my funds right away.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are clearly times when you should *not* FE. <br /><br />I would think very carefully about using any vendor that requires FE, especially if they don&#039;t have a good track record on feedback for completed transactions and/or the forums.<br /><br />BTW, this newbie crap of having to get 50 posts before being able to post to the general forums is BS IMHO.<br /><br />The most likely people to get scammed are newbies. And suddenly they can&#039;t alert the general community when it happens. Plus, maybe I just don&#039;t post much.

				Further, I&#039;ve heard vendors complain about having to wait for transactions to auto-finalize, which means they probably are waiting a long time after the customer has the product to get their money.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand this at all. SupremeSmoke, who has the most awesome dope has had to blacklist people because they didn&#039;t finalize on time consistently. If you have your product, why wait? It&#039;s not like you have access to the funds anyway.
