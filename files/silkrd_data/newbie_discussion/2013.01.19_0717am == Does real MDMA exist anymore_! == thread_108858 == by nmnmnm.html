				I recently purchased some supposed MDMA from one of the top uk vendors on the silk road.<br />I got similar effects as I had from the famous dutch Q dance pills and other pills from the same supplier.<br /><br />A blurry unfocused mildly amusing but at the same time kinda uncomfortable high.<br /><br />I would pay crazy money for real MDMA. The psychedelic, wickedly euphoric drug that I remember.<br /><br />Marquis reagent test or not, I believe someone should send this shit to the lab where I can guarantee it will not come back as MDMA.<br /><br /><br /><br />If anyone knows of some real MDMA please do not hesitate to contact me. I will buy it.

				Can&#039;t find that guy psycho.<br /><br />David: I have done real MDMA once. I will never forget that night. I feel like the only person in the world who&#039;s standing up to this bullshit.<br />I done a lot of mcat when it was legal, It was awesome every time. Now all of a sudden I don&#039;t feel any euphoria from an amazingly more euphoric drug? Give me a break<br /><br />Also, my brother and his friend tried it and weren&#039;t that impressed. They have no other tolerance to these kind of drugs.<br /><br />No trippy it just means the new generation of drug users have never tried real mdma. Not like I&#039;m old I&#039;m only 21 but I haven&#039;t seen real mdma since I was 16.<br /><br />rosanne...That&#039;s just fucking ridiculous. This is the reason the vendors are so successful in selling their shit imitation mdma.

				The first few times I rolled I was getting pills that were supposedly mdma, mda, and a bit of speed. Awesome pills, they were called &quot;Mints&quot; and I hear that they are produced somewhere near Chicago. but anyways, the last two times I&nbsp; rolled on &quot;molly&quot; it was not nearly the intensity of effects that I&#039;d get off of two or three mints. Mdma makes me feel all great in the ways everyone describes but those pills had this distinct draw to music and you&#039;d be rubbing your hands over your knees all night, eye wiggles, massive energy. Right before this newbie bullshit I had been meaning to ask about people&#039;s experiences with drug combos and thier theories on &quot;different&quot; rolls.

				If you do research yes you will find the real shit&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; also there&#039;s a good possibility you lost the magic cuz you did post<br /><br />&quot;I done a lot of mcat when it was legal, It was awesome every time. Now all of a sudden I don&#039;t feel any euphoria from an amazingly more euphoric drug? Give me a break&quot;<br /><br />&quot;ive done a lot of mcat&quot; <br />this is what caught my eye. i&#039;m not a biologist or a chemist so this is all speculation but the use of mcat doesn&#039;t go that far back so there isn&#039;t a lot of scientific evidence on how it affects ur brain, but other drugs can kill the magic for mdma other drugs can fuck up ur serotonin and dopamine receptors, especially RC&#039;s that are new . You either got bunk shit or ur other drug use has killed ur receptors.<br />&nbsp;i know that methylone use has diminished the overall effect of mdma for me. but i still got the magic but its nowhere near the same as my first time and ive came to the conclusion it will never be like the first time unless i stop for years and allow my brain to fully recover. but that takes any from 5&nbsp; or more years of no drugs lolz thats not happening

				Yeah I&#039;ve not &quot;burned out my receptors&quot; nobody burns them out so much their MDMA lacks any euphoria. It wasn&#039;t MDMA.<br />I also done it with a person who has very little experience with these kind of drugs. <br /><br />It was from one of the top UK vendors.

				All I can add is that I&#039;ve purchased &#039;ecstasy&#039; in both salt and pill form from different vendors, yet felt the same exact high from each, all of which were purportedly MDMA. It was very euphoric; I&#039;d work on music and feel my body meld with the bass frequencies of whatever track I was working on, and every time it helped to repair my relationship which had been going to shit.<br /><br />That being said, I have no &#039;true&#039; MDMA feeling to compare it to, so they could&#039;ve all been the same kind of MDxx.<br />*shrugs*<br /><br />It felt amazing and definitely wasn&#039;t a solely methamphetamine high.

				It definitely exists on the road.&nbsp; Find a vendor with a good rep, check the forums and maybe reagent test if you want extra peace of mind.<br /><br />I&#039;m not accusing your vendor or this, but I know on the street a lot of dealers are passing bk-MDMA as MDMA and feel exactly how you described.&nbsp; Kinda like molly-rolling but lacking the real magic.&nbsp; In my area you used to be able to get consistently good MDMA until the last 2-3 years when bk started popping up everywhere.

				One thing that might help get a cleaner high is to wash your MDMA when you receive it. Using multiple hot/cold solvent washes you can get a lot of impurities out (but not all of them mind you). Another thing to consider is that, in my experience, MDMA was incredibly magical the first time I did it but each subsequent time (even with the same batch) was not quite as awe inspiring.

				It is around if you know where to look. The road is a good place to began your search.

				I like very much mdma and I&#039;ve been using it for 6 years or so. Just for recreational purposes, in clubs once a month top... But the very first time during a drum &amp; bass party - Andy C and some dudes from Ram Records (holly shit!) - was just epic. Since then, this magic never happened again. Kind of, but never as great as the first time. And this is the same story for many users. The mdma honey moon is just the best experience ever with the product. No matter how much. So my point is maybe you guys are looking for the awesomeness that you would never find again. Not the product&#039;s fault. Maybe every time we try, the expectation for the effect ruins the effect itself. Very psycho stuff anyway... So do not bother to looking for rainbow unicorns, just party hard, roll hard, and drink loads of water haha! And by the way some really good vendors around SR do the job very well for the molly. FartBomber is one of them, as far as i&#039;ve tried around...

				Yeah, read the forums, SR reviews etc especially early in the week. <br /><br />UUsing weekly of more - the magic comes back just takes aaaaaggggeeeeeeeesssssss...... Try playing with an unrelated compound for a while maybe? Next solid mdma hit you get will make the wait all the more worthwhile!!!<br /><br />If you think what you&#039;re getting is just crap, reagent tests aren&#039;t expensive, or just go elsewhere!<br />

				Yes. I don&#039;t want to tell you which pills to buy until the road is back up and I can buy them first. Ate one and was fucking tripping, what the fuck!? <br /><br />But yeah you&#039;re fucking trippin&#039; on high doses, pretty sure that permafries some parts of the brain, not a surprise it doesn&#039;t work so well anymore.
