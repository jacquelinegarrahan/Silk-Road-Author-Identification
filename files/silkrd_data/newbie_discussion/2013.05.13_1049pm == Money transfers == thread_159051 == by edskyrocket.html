				I have a question pertaining money.<br />When you transfer a reasonable amount of money to the bank in regular intervals, how can you justify this?<br />Can the bank see where this money comes from? <br /><br />I know you can of course just start a business and say it&#039;s profit,<br />but how do you explain this money comes from a bitcoin exchange like mtgox?

				Ok thanks for you answer.<br /><br />I&#039;m based in the Netherlands, not earning â‚¬1000 a week YET, but you&#039;ll never know and I&#039;d like to be prepared for when I will.<br /><br />Are there alternatives for starting a business? <br />And is their any way the bank can find out the money came from Silk Road?

				Yes, of course banks can see where the money comes from.&nbsp; They can see the bank, account number, name of the account holder and stuff.&nbsp; How could they not see that?&nbsp; Anonymous bank transfers? lol<br /><br />You have a lot of research to do.

He asked if the bank could know if the money (here, bitcoins) came for SR. The bank only sees that the money comes from Mt.Gox (or another exchange), that&#039;s it. You should tumble your bitcoins a little before sending them to Mt.Gox though and use a better exchange like bitstamp.
