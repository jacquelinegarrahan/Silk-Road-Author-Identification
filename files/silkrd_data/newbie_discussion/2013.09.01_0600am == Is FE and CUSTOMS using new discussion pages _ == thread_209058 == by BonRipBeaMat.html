				I just seen this in the discussion area of a vendors listing page.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now i am no expert here but does this sound like a cop or customs sniffing around or what ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The 3rd paragraph got me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please tell me am i being papanoid or not ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is what is wrote<br />Aus buyers: as the U-Beaut dude said above, the pros do it like this for a reason, the more comms back and fro the more of a sniff the dogs/LE get. He wont answer or tell you SQUAT, unless there is a problem after many weeks have past, but he averages 5/5 for a reason- he gets the job done.<br /><br />Aus buyers:Dont wait for tracking before FE&#039;ing. he doesnt even acknowledge your order until he sees u have FE&#039;d. And sometimes that can be a week or so later. Then u get yur legit tracking code. Mine was sent to Aus on 24/8, hasnt arrived on our shores yet.<br /><br />Previous Aus buyers can u private msg me what type of int&#039;l shipment he uses so i know what time to expect across the atlantic? Or just how long from depart US to arrive Oz?<br /><br />Another tip: if customs unfortunately does ever catch yur shipment- as they seem to do 80%+ of the time these days (bravo customs, u guys are TOO good), they donet even acknowledge that it landed in our country. All yur tracking will say is &#039;departed US date etc.&#039; and thats it. The rest is a mystery. No letter. No control dleivery. Just &#039;added to the pile&#039;.<br /><br />and thus hereby lies the wait... wish me luck my fellow travellers :-)

				@CHROOT .&nbsp; I understand what your saying but i have to say the discussion pages are great for the Aussies because the real scam vendors target the Aussies big time and its already helping the Aussies not be scammed. You understand man ?
