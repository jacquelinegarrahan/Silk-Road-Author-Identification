				Hello!<br />I just joined Silk Road a few days ago, because I was interested in LSD. I couldn&#039;t buy it because I didn&#039;t have BTC and I saw a pretty nice offer from The Flying Dutchman (you may know him). When I went to the shop again all his LSD offers were gone but since I bookmarked it I have access to it.<br />Here is the link: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/501b91aca4<br /><br />If I buy this, will I get the product? I don&#039;t know since it&#039;s not listed in the LSD page anymore...<br /><br />Also I wanted to ask what happens if your delivery gets seized. Do they just throw it away? or they send the police to your address?<br />Because I live in Germany and have no access to a ghost address...<br /><br />Thank you for reading and I hope I get some answers :)<br />have a good day!

				Yes. You can still place an order. The vendor likely put the listing in &quot;stealth&quot; mode which means you can only access the listing if you have the link. The reason vendors might put a listing in stealth is if they have a limited supply or are getting too many orders at once. However, the stealth mode listing allows previous customers,&nbsp; or in your case, those have saved the URL, to order. The vendor may decline your order because a possible reason he went it to stealth mode was to save product for long-time customers. <br /><br />I say give it a shot! :)
