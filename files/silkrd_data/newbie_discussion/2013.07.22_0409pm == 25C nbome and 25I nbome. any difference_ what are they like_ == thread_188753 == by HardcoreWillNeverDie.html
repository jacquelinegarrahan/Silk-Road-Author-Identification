				There are actually a few more than just the ones you mentioned. Like 25b 25d but I&#039;m shure there are more because they are all derived from the 2c family 2cb-&gt; 25b.&nbsp; 2ci-&gt; 25i and so on<br /><br />To be completly honest they arnt like lsd i like 25i aa lot better. Than lsd. Thats because it doesn&#039;t contain the mind looping and to me has a push behind it. But everyone&#039;s experience is different.<br /><br />As to compare I&#039;ve only tried 25i and 25b and I really liked them both. They had sutle differences.I would say the 25i was a much stronger trip and more visual than 25b But I&#039;ve heard really good things about 25c because its soppose to just be more euphoric but that&#039;s just reports. The next tabs i buy will be 25c. Thier is a lot of info on these substances on erowid that can help your decision. But I don&#039;t think you can go wrong with either one. I&#039;d recommend an hcl over complexed blotters so you don&#039;t have ro hold ur saliva in ur mouth for 30 mins without swallowing.<br /><br />Goodluck

				alright<br />I did not know they are from the same family as 2cb and so on.<br /><br />do NBOmEs also have a short period of high like 4-6 hours and no come-downs?<br /><br />a big thank you for your help brother!

				No they have a longer time of duration I&#039;m gona say 8-12 more like lsd in length.&nbsp; But actually duration varies between each nbome. If I&#039;m not mistaken I think 25i is the longest duration and 25e is the shortest but erowid would tell you more. From what I&#039;ve read nbome are about 40x sronger than thier 2c counterparts but the trip is still different because I&#039;ve taken 40mg 2cb and 1mg 25b nbome and thier was a difference the 25b was a little cleaner trip. <br /><br />Some people report a head ache on the comedown of 25i but I don&#039;t have that problem or any side effects really. After I take 25i I can&#039;t sleep for about 14 hours so consider that. But if I get 2hr sleep after that I can make it through the day with no hangover Its not like 2cb where you can sleep 7hr after you take it.<br /><br />And they are not exactly in the same family. They are created from the other. Do your research before buying it is a strong chemical.

				I&#039;ve tried 25i, 25b and 25c.<br /><br />(25i - 1.2mgs or 1200ug)<br />From my experience (and everyone&#039;s is different) the 25i is best if you&#039;re going out to a rave or a party. Pretty clear headspace but still tripping nicely.<br /><br />(25c - 1mg or 1000ug)<br />25c I tried twice and honestly I&#039;d have to do it again to give a correct description.. it was just weird.<br /><br />(25b - 1mg or 1000ug)<br />25b I tried 2 days ago and it KICKED MY ASS. For me, 25b is something you stay home and trip your balls off with lol.<br />

				ok SR friends, now it is more clear after your descriptions.<br /><br />I compared the prices LSD and 25I nboMe. It is interesting to notice that its the same price whether you buy one blotter of a good quality lsd or 5 blotters of 25I nboMe&nbsp; :o<br /><br />it shows to me (although I am experienced only with Lucy) that 25I nboMe has a different story of making you high and that its probably not so intense of introspective, self-analysis or mindfuck as lsd does to you. <br />so from what you explain here, its more like an easier substance where one could go to a party with strange people but still trip high with visuals and nice body load.<br /><br />correct me if its wrong ))

I&#039;m only just getting started exploring the NBOMe&#039;s, but have extensive experience with the corresponding 2C&#039;s. Would you say that there is a correlation between the effects of the isomers? For me, 2C-B is sharp, edgy and with pushy colour-inferno - enjoyable as long as you keep the dose within reasonable limits. 2C-I is less potent, more silly, and better for social events as festivals. 2C-C is almost devoid of visuals in the dosages I&#039;ve tried, but with enjoyable body- and mindeffects, without playing too many tricks on your mind. For me, 2C-B definately has the most &quot;teeth&quot; - sounds like something similar is going on for the NBOMe&#039;s, or could it be a matter of dosage?

				Yes to a certain extent. I thing the 2cx and 25x classes are both very individual. Lsd me and my friends have really cole trips and same amount of visuals and stuff. If me and my friends take 2cb I may be laffing and giggly as my friend beside me is seeing faces from like myan ruins same with 25i everybody has very different trips because I may see tons of visuals and my friend mey see close to none. I think this class of drug has very individual effects from one person to the next.
