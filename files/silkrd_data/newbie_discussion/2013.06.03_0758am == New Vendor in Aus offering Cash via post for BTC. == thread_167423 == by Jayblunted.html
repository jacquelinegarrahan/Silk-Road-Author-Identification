				Trade your BTC for Cash through SR escrow and receive Cash in trackable express post. Does this sound like a good idea?<br />Considering this vendor is only a month old and done only 14 transactions Im worried it could either be a scam or a sting. The rates are not great either. You basically give this person 5 BTC and receive the value of about 4 in cash. But for the whole transfer process you avoid the banks, tax department, LE and any one who investigates money laundering.<br /><br />This is his vendor page if anyone wants a peek-<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3afdcf4579<br /><br />My fear is this could be a set up to find out who is trading large sums of BTC and then disclosing a postage address to track you down with.<br />Othewise if its genuine and you could talk down the expensive exchange rate Im all fucking keen on it.<br /><br />Anyone got an opinion on this?

The two main problems are that the rate is very bad and it is a good way for LE to track someone down. It is a lot harder to deny using silk road when you buy directly from it!<br /><br />Unless you were desperate there are probably much safer and less expensive ways to get your money out.

Part of being a successful vendor is being able to cash out regularly in a way where you aren&#039;t giving your personal details (address, state you reside in, etc) away to anyone. There are numerous ways a vendor could cash out anonymously if they&#039;ve done their homework and researched each method carefully. It&#039;s not as hard to do as some may think but you must always proceed with caution and use your brain when doing so. Cashing out can be a vendor&#039;s weak point if not done correctly. <br />This vendor&#039;s offer is so dangerous in many respects and shouldn&#039;t be used IMO. There are other ways to achieve the same result without the need to disclose any details to anyone.

				If you are vendor looking to cash out. There are anonymous ways of doing so outside of SR. There are fee involved, but it is legit and reliable.

				The problem Ive found with &quot;cashing out&quot; outside of SR is that you are not being anonymous. If you use a Bitcoin exchange you are disclosing details about yourself to the exchange and the bank receiving the transfer. How much can you deposit into a bank account each week or month from a Bitcoin Exchange before you raise a flag of suspicion with the bank? <br />Where else can you trade BTC for cash without leaving a digital footprint? Im yet to find one without going to the extremes of identity fraud or offshore money laundering which are not the measures I want to take. <br />If someone can share how they do it please PM me. <br />Selling BTC is one big headache.

Using a Bitcoin Exchange/Bank is &quot;NUTS&quot; if you intend on cashing out BTC anonymously. It&#039;s as simple as &quot;you get out of it what you put into it&quot; meaning it takes time to research and discover possible methods. Even then, they must be tried and tested before larger sums of BTC could be used. You need to look &quot;outside the box&quot; and not think of conventional methods.

				Hey guys,<br /><br />This is BITcoinEXchangeAUS or BITEX as you would know me from my listings on SR.<br />It is great to see a lot of conversation based around my business model.<br />As of today I have 21 transactions with 100% positive feedback and counting.<br />I have just a couple of points to add to the topic...<br /><br />- I have clients who I have met both within and outside of SR.&nbsp; Many of my clients are legitimate Bitcoin miners (including myself).&nbsp; By building my business this way, my legitimate clients and &#039;other&#039; are masked together.<br /><br />- My SR listings are a way for a new client to build a business relationship with me at the same time as taking advantage of the SR Escrow system.&nbsp; In return for this security, the SR commission has been factored into the listing price. This is why the exchange rate doesn&#039;t look as attractive.<br /><br />- Once a relationship has been established, my &quot;Bitcoin into Cash (AU$5000) (FULL ESCROW)&quot; is open to order at a cheaper rate through SR.&nbsp; Receive $5,000 cash in the mail the next day after ordering.&nbsp; No bank transfer, no trace.<br /><br />- I have other products available outside the SR network at cheaper rates.&nbsp; As I said, I have many legitimate Bitcoin buyers and sellers.&nbsp; I have a number of clients who exchange their Bitcoin into cash these ways.<br /><br />- I strictly do NOT save my client&#039;s addresses.<br /><br />Please be in contact with me at anytime.<br />Keep the conversation going about me...<br /><br />BITEX
