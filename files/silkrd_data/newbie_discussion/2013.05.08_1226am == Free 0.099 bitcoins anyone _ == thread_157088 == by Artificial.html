				Just to let you know, I don&#039;t want your bitcoins because i don&#039;t need them, and i&#039;m sure there&#039;s some other poor bastard out there whos short on cash and needs a hit of something special off of the worlds 8th wonder The Silk Road.<br />I think its a wonderful gesture, and if you follow through with it all the better!<br />I hope someone makes a post that stuns the forums to keyboard silence and hysterical laughter and it&#039;s someone that needs it too.<br /><br />Take it steady man<br />Astrona

				This is a true story. It was the fall of 1989 in New York City during the Grateful Dead&#039;s extended run at Madison Square Garden. I was about ummteen years old at the time. During the festivities outside the show I left my crews chill stop to by an eighth of mushrooms&nbsp; from an older hippie girl. She was about 50. I asked her, &quot;should I eat the whole bag or just half?&quot;. Her response was, &quot;man if you eat that whole bag im not gonna be there to peel you off the walls HAHAHAHAHA&quot;. <br /><br />Well that sounded great to me, so I ate the whole bag. Returning to my stop I discovered that my friends disappeared having probably went into the show. I got on the line to get in, and back then it took a LOOOONG time to get into MSG for the grateful dead.&nbsp; After about 45 minutes I finally made it into the show, but was beginning to trip. It took me awhile to find out where my seat was, and when I found what I thought was my seat I sat down and breathed a sigh of relief. The mushrooms were coming on strong at this point and the house lights were still up. I started staring at my hands and arms and my freckles began to crawl around and eventually my flesh was melting off my bones and muscles. I surely was enjoying myself. <br /><br />The house lights dimmed and everyone&#039;s face I saw was misshapen and breathing with a glowing inner light. About halfway through the first song a giant and I mean GIANT hell&#039;s angels biker approached me at my seat and told me, &quot;GET UP you are in my seat!&quot; I was tripping really hard at this point and got a really bad case of anxiety.<br /><br />I left &#039;his&#039; seat and began walking up the stairs to try to discern through the throngs of people where my actual reserved seat was located. As I ascended the steps the flesh melting continued to the point where my lefts became puddles of goo like warm marshmallow.&nbsp; I was walking but each step I took I had to pull the good of what was my legs up from the concrete and it was making a squishing sound. I was slowly completley melting into the structure of the building. <br /><br />Luckily an old man working as an usher saw what I was going through and grabbed me by the hand and personally escorted to my &#039;actual&#039; seat...which was really no where near where I thought it was in the first place. <br /><br />This has been and always will be one of the most intense mind bending experiences of my life. <br /><br />Have a grateful day.<br />Love and Light

				Alright so back in 1992 i had huge binge with lsd that lasted well over 5months and ended me in a psychiatric hospital, you may find this quite interesting. It all started a lollapalooza i ran into my old friend allen who was carrying around a large drink with him, me and allen have been long time tripping buddys since the 80&#039;s and i knew he just had to have a little &quot;kick in his drink&quot;. I was i guess you could say i was moderately intoxicated and my judgment was impaired a bit also note i was already trippin on a few hits of some bomb,&nbsp; he asked me if i wanted to take a trip and nodded towards his drink, i said hell yeah. Grabbed that sucker out of his hands and took a big gulp down, he told me to take a sip but with my bad judgement, of course i took a huge gulp. He grabbed the cup from me quickly with a look on his face that read &quot;What the fuck have you just done?&quot;. I questioned why he was looking at me like that and he said he had about .6 grams soaked in it! Before i could even comprehend what i did in my drunken state the world turned into a bliss of colors and animation. I estimated i took in about 10-20 milligrams of acid, which is equivalent to about 100-200 hits. My buddy guided me to a more secluded area and i sat on the grass in utter colorful bliss the rest of the event was pretty much a blur to me, i remember very deep conversations with the group of friends allen was with. At no point was i paranoid or scared or &quot;psychotic&quot; it was honestly a beautiful experience. more down the road i met a nice fellow named Steve, steve i guess you could say was the weed MAN. You want kilos of the best shit? Steve. You want the best hash and extract at vast quantities and for dirt cheap? Steve! I started trading him countless sheets of lsd for some hash and extracts, it was an awesome thing we had. a bit later i was at a little get together with some buddies, i was on about 15 hits at this point feelin pretty good. I&#039;m not much of a drinker and when i do drink i&#039;m a lightweight. They had a nice ice luge and i took a few beers and drinks down from it. Within minutes i was hurling everywhere and i got so much shit from everyone on how i could be so chill on 15 hits but a few drinks had me hurling and incredibly drunk. After done being sick and sobered up enough to function pretty well i met some nice, good looking women who later gave me there number. I called up these women at one point and they invited me to a party, it was great i was probably doing a mild 5 good hits. i saw them tweaking what appeared to me as crystal acid and they asked if i wanted a bump, of course i couldn&#039;t resist and took in a huge line to the nose. Within minutes i was HIGH as fuck the HIGHEST i&#039;ve ever been and i asked them what the fuck was goin on? it turns out IT WAS METH. FUCK!! i started having a horrible insane trip/high where reality was lost and i was going ballistic. Some people from the party took me to the hospital because i was so out of hand. They emitted me into Havenwyck hospital, (loony bin) where i had horrible delusions and paranoia for days, i had incredibly ridiculous conspiracy of where i was and other psychosis. at about 35 days i was still tripping hard but i had it some what under control where i was able to convince them i was able to be released. After that, lsd has never been the same i do not like any psychedelics it reminds me of the delusions and the horrible experiences i had in the hospital, but overall i guess you could say 21 years later i&#039;m fully healthy and functional and haven&#039;t really had any long terms effects from the amounts of lsd that i use to consume.

				Here&#039;s a story you might enjoy:<br /><br />Im a twin, and when my brother and I were about 7 we went to the ocean bars. Whilst there our two older brothers decided to go look at the waves over by the rocks and my twin ran after them yelling &quot;HEY! WAIT FOR ME!&quot;. My twin slipped and fell, hitting his head. Seeing this, I immediately rushed to his rescue yelling &quot;BROTHER! ARE YOU OKAY?!&quot; and when I reached the spot he just got up to, I slipped and fell, and hit my head. In the exact same way.<br />Our older brothers tear up just thinking about this story.

				If your looking for someone who deserves it and has paid their dues many times over. Is almost 65 years old but still loves a binge every now and then when the kids aren&#039;t home. Who would never be approached by street vendors because he looks too old. Then I&#039;m your man.

				There was once a man they called Fran,<br />Who spent all his days in a van,<br />Washing his toes and blowing his loads,<br />Such a simple old man, Mr. Fran<br /><br />This Fran was a God fearing man,<br />The bible was always in hand,<br />He believed in a guy,<br />Way up in the sky,<br />That damned those he couldn&#039;t command<br /><br />Until one day came a sign,<br />Beyond all his senses and time,<br />A feeling that sucked, <br />All the life from his gut,<br />Outside of all reason and rhyme<br /><br />So Fran left his home and he ran,<br />To where and for what wasn&#039;t clear,<br />For this feeling he feared,<br />That snuck in his gut,<br />What nearing escape through his rear<br /><br />Tis wasn&#039;t a normal release,<br />This feeling that pushed through his crease,<br />No movement before shook his soul to the core,<br />Like this movement, this awful disease<br /><br />And as it erupted with force,<br />Fran&#039;s destiny flew from his draws,<br />In rapture he seized, <br />And with authority plead,<br />For the Lord to bow down in retort<br /><br />Fran fell with a thunderous clap,<br />Impacting the ground with such speed,<br />That reality tore, and Fran was no more,<br />Leaving time and space in defeat <br /><br />Yet after a while Fran returned,<br />His mind feeling like roasted bird,<br />So he scrambled aloft, covered in turd,<br />And realized just what had occurred<br /><br />His knickers were thoroughly drenched,<br />In slobber and poopy and piss,<br />And his hands were still clenched,<br />On his Bible and spliff,<br />And both were lathered in sherm<br /><br />And so this man they called Fran,<br />Dropped his Bible and ran,<br /><br />To the city to wash his ass hole.<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading.

				I&#039;ve got a story for you :) Here goes:<br /><br />Five or so years ago, I go into a bar. I sit down at the counter and say to the bartender, &quot;If I show you something you&#039;ve never seen in your life, could I drink free for the night?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sure,&quot; says the bartender, an older man, &quot;try me. But be warned, I&#039;ve seen a whole lot in my day.&quot;<br /><br />So I reach into my backpack and pull out a miniature grand piano. I set it on the counter. &quot;That&#039;s it?&quot; the bartender asks, obviously less-than-amazed.<br /><br />&quot;Just wait.&quot; I reach back into my bag. From it I withdraw Richard, a real, living one-foot-tall man. I place him on the counter. Richard is dressed to the nines, wearing a black tuxedo with his tiny grey hairs slicked back. He then sits down at the mini piano and proceeds to play Beethoven&#039;s Fifth. And it&#039;s stunning. The music flows out of him through the little piano and into the whole bar with more ease and beauty than anything anyone&#039;s heard before. Soon, everyone is watching. Nobody can believe their eyes.<br /><br />&quot;Please!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;Drink free tonight! And the rest of the week! It would be a shame not too.&quot; Pleased, I down a couple glasses of scotch.<br /><br />Some poor bastard sitting next to me looks over, and after obvious hesitation, gives me a nudge. &quot;If yer dun mind me asking, mister, how&#039;d yer find &#039;im? That lil guy, I mean ter say...&quot; He points at Richard.<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; I reply. &quot;I found a genie in a lamp a few years back...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A genie?!? What&#039;re- how&#039;s a that work??&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, you see, you rub the lamp and if you&#039;re lucky-&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A lucky lamp, eh? Might yer have dis here lamp wit ya, mister?&quot;<br /><br />Sure enough, I had brought it with me. So I reach back into my pack, and pull out an old, beat-up copper oil lamp. The poor man is skeptical. &quot;There&#039;s really a genie in there, yuh say?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That there is.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, uhhh... yer wouldernt mind if I uh gave it a go, now would yer, mister?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Go ahead and try,&quot; I say, handing him the lamp. He rubs it.<br /><br />Poof! A genie pops out. &quot;Your wish is my command!&quot; he hollers in an airy voice. &quot;What do you most desire?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Arrright!&quot; shrieks the poor man. &quot;How bout er million bucks!&quot;<br /><br />Immediately the sun is blackened out, the sky overwhelmed with grey! The door to the bar flies open. The windows shatter. Things go everywhere. Utter chaos abounds.<br /><br />Yelling over the sound of flapping wings and quacks, the poor man screams, &quot;A million BUCKS! I said a million BUCKS. Not ducks! BUCKS!&quot;<br /><br />I turn to him and say quite simply, &quot;Now do you really think I asked for a twelve inch pianist?&quot;<br /><br />;)
