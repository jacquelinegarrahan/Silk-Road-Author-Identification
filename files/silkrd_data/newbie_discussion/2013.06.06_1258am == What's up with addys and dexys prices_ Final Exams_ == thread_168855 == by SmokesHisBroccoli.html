				It&#039;s been since February since I ordered any addys or dexys.&nbsp; Some of the same vendors I used then are still selling, but the prices seem really high nowadays.&nbsp; I mean one vendor I was paying between $10-15 for a 10mg IR dexy and now it&#039;s coming out to $28 each in a bulk order.&nbsp; WTF!?&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone perhaps recommend a vendor that has some reasonable prices and a great reputation on SR for either addys or dexys.&nbsp; I refuse to pay $20+ for these pills.&nbsp;

				Adderall/Dexedrine/Desoxyn has always been very expensive on SR, and lately the prices just keep going up, I don&#039;t understand exactly why. Maybe the fact that people keep paying the outrageous prices, it just gives vendors all the more reason to keep jacking them up.

				I agree it is nuts. You might as well buy some coke or meth instead. The high lasts just as long if not longer and you get more for less. We should start a petition for lower prices on addy&#039;s! It would take about 100 years to get any attention but hey its worth a shot!! :)

				Coke&#039;s alright but I get super pissed off after it wears off.&nbsp; Don&#039;t plan on trying meth.&nbsp; I just feel much more comfortable getting a couple of pills shipped to me as opposed to coke or meth.&nbsp; Back in Jan and Feb this year I&#039;m pretty sure there were more listings for addys and dexys and they went for $15 each from a lot of vendors.&nbsp; Although I did a search for adderall in the title and sorted by most recent here on the forum and I found some vendors who do sell for $15.&nbsp; One guy marked his price down to $12 on May 29.&nbsp; I bet he sold out real fast.&nbsp; I just have a feeling a lot of colleges have final exams and the vendors are taking advantage.&nbsp; Which is cool I understand.&nbsp; I just hope the prices come back down to earth or it&#039;ll have to be a real occasional treat for me to take one of these pills.&nbsp;
