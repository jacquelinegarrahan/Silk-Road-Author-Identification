				I&#039;m new to the fourm but should I expect to see my order of LSD that I made early last week? I was waiting for tracking number as of Monday so I&#039;m hoping it was sent out but what are the chances?

				I placed an order yesterday before noon in the UK, from a UK vendor that had good reviews for next day delivery. It did not arrive today, the last status before SR went down this afternoon was &#039;processing&#039;.<br /><br />It was not marked as in transit, but is there a chance it has been sent anyway?

				If it is not here tomorrow I will go from having a tiny hope to forgetting it. But to more experienced buyers; how often does it happen that that an order is &#039;processing&#039; and in the mail?<br /><br />Just annoys me that the selling point was speedy del, and it taking so long to dispatch. I wonder when they knew SR was going down.
