				Hi,<br /><br />After a few days reading the forums i think im about ready to make my first post and thought i might as well make it a worthwhile post.<br /><br />here&#039;s what i think ive learnt, i think ive understood everything i need to but would appreciate anyone&#039;s advice on anythign ive either missed or misunderstood. Obviously i intend to remian anonymous, untraceable, out of prison and nicely high&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I purchase my bitcons from an exchange like MTGox - i can do this by transferring the money to them via a bank, no ID required, just walk in off the street with cash?&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />i transfer the BC&#039;s to one of the two wallets ive downloaded, send them from the first wallet to the second and then to my SR account - do i need to do this as SR has a tumbler?<br /><br />place my order - ive already selected a couple of trusted vendors in my country ( if i can get it domestically why add customs to the equation)<br /><br />the BC&#039;s go into Escrow (FE is a bad idea i take it?) and i complete when i receive he package.<br /><br />i live in a rented home and we get post delivered for former residents all the time so can can use one of their names for delivery no problem, all post is deposited in a communal area and sometimes bits are left there for 3-4 days so i can leave it there for a day if im super paranoid and then pick it up.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Clearly using TOR isn&#039;t beyond me, ive read up on PGP and that seems straight forward enough, im pretty technically minded so understand what encryption and public keys etc... are all about.<br /><br />if i want to get really careful ive downloaded TrueCrypt and DiskCryptor out of curiosity mostly, interesting stuff there regarding bootable USB&#039;s with hidden secondary OS&#039;s and so on - I might just do this for the sake of it.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />a few years ago I used to order weed from a couple of online places, one in Canada and another Dutch site i think it was, transferring money to liberty reserve from the local bank...i think i even had an e-gold accoutn at some point too. I forget the names but must have received 25-30 orders without any problems so im not a noob to this kind of things, been getting high one way or the other for 20 years and looking forward to getting my hands on some top quality goodies.<br /><br />and lastly, i will only be ordering personal use amounts, my dealing days are a long way behind me. ;D<br /><br />have i missed anything?<br /><br />all comments very much appreciated.<br /><br />spam away<br /><br /><br /><br />
