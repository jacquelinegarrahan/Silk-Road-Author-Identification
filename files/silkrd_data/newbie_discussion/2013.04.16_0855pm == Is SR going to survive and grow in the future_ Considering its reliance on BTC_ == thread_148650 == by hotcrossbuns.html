				Basically we use Bitcoin because it’s not issued or stored by banks and doesn’t require any online registrations, and thus offers a certain amount of anonymity. However, with SR growing in popularity there will be more and more attempts to shut down the market right? Will the sale of BTC&#039;s become harder, as in new laws to make every person who wants to buy coins to upload photo ID etc? <br /><br />Even so they would still have no way of following these coins, considering the laundering availability? Therfor will BTC&#039;s just be made illegal someday? and is that possible? <br /><br />For me sites such as SR and its future competitors are the future of Drug Dealing and the only way to really stop it is to relax drug laws... But I am new here, young and possibly over optimistic.. I hope someone gives a serious go at answering these questions, even though it is hard to predict and I have posted it in the Newbie section...<br /><br />Peace love and hotcrossbuns xx

				it would be pretty difficult to shut down in my opinion, i&#039;d imagine it&#039;s servers are somewhere pretty anonymous, they could crack down in individual countries but as a whole it would be difficult.<br /><br />even though it&#039;s full of scammers sites like topix have been running for years and that&#039;s not even particularly anonymous

				I think it will survive but I hope it doesn&#039;t grow too much because too much negative attention will only increase government scrutiny. Also with too many vendors there will be an increase in the amount of vendors who are less than stealthy and compromise buyer security at the same time. There&#039;s already enough scammers making tons of money off this site and newbies are all too willing to FE b/c they lack patience and are so excited to buy drugs this way.

				I think the reliance on BTC will help SR survive. Sure, the market is volatile and unpredictable, but overall things seem to go smoothly if you look at it holistically. After all, if SR really were terrible, it wouldn&#039;t have existed for so long.<br /><br />But like anonypunk, I hope it does not grow too much in popularity.

				I think that it could die at some point, especially with all the attention it&#039;s getting, but it always can be replaced by something else. It&#039;s pretty easy to start a TOR service and as long TOR exists, it will be possible to run a service like this.<br /><br />CL
