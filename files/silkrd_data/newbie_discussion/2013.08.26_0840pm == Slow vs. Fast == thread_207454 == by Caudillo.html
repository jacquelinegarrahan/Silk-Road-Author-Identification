				Which do you prefer for mailing?<br /><br />I mean, do you subscribe to the school of thought that you want it out of their hands as quick as possible, or that going to fast arouses suspicions?

				As fast as possible.<br /><br />Good vendors will have a product in stock and ready to be shipped. All it should take is to print a label and get it in the post.

				I meant in terms of what kind of shipping is selected, not in terms of how fast the vendor is (obviously then I would want it to be super quick).<br /><br />In the setup I have now trust is not an issue so I have them send the slowest, untracked way possible because whenever I have had trouble it was with overnight (admittedly non USPS/canadapost) shippers. But I am always open to the possibility there is a better way.<br /><br />Sorry if I was not clear.

				I&#039;ve read up a lot on these forums regarding shipping methods.&nbsp; Of course most of it is speculation and you have to sift through the information and make a decision.&nbsp; But from what I&#039;ve read and my experiences the best shipping methods are in this order:<br /><br />1. USPS Priority<br />2. First Class or Regular Snail Mail<br />3. USPS Express<br /><br />Express is too risky and a lot of vendors don&#039;t offer it.&nbsp; Priority is the most popular method vendors offer.&nbsp; I honestly like first class/regular mail the most but most vendors don&#039;t offer it.&nbsp; The reason I like it the most is the largest amount of mail falls under this category.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re ordering something small like pills they can easily fit in a small envelope with a stamp on them and I&#039;m pretty confident they don&#039;t check small envelopes like they do big heavy boxes.&nbsp;
