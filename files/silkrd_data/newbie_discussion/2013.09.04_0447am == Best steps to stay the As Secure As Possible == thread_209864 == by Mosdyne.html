				I&#039;ve researched and take a few secure steps, but I fear It&#039;s just the bare minimum.<br />TorBrowser Bundle<br />GnuPG<br />Get New Identity at random times just to be sure there isn&#039;t a pattern.<br />Coinbase<br />Blockchainz<br />Any other recommendations?

				Work on behavior.&nbsp; Carefully meter how you share information - whether cookies in a browser or context in a web forum.&nbsp; Being consistent in your encryption, anonymity and awareness skills is more important than any of the technologies listed.

				many here ( forums) recommend using TAILS- this will prevent any trace of TOR activity on your pc-<br />also it is recommended that you change your passphrase and pin ( with a secure random password) everythime you make a purchase-<br /><br />&nbsp;also some people have fallen victim to phishing scams - so- i dont even bother to keep more than .01 BTC at any time in my SR account - so i could lose it and not worry- instead you can keep it in a wallet like multibit- just be sure to back it up so if your system crashes you can recover it- also common sense- memorize SR URL or have it bookmarked and never get to it through a random link- also never use the same username/passphrase combo for anything else<br /><br />greater paranoia would warrant full disk encryption which can easily be done with truecrypt- which will also create virtual drvies which are encrypted-very usefull-<br /><br />also never FE and do your homework on vendors before ordering - alot of common sense- but for simple purchases- just cover yourself and be safe

				A lot of staying safe is using your brain. Since people have already gone over technology aspects I figured I&#039;d add the following.<br /><br />Don&#039;t order from vendors who have been proven (in feedback or on the forums) to use poor stealth shipping methods. If you&#039;re ordering weed from the West Coast that isn&#039;t even vacuum packed, or at BEST it&#039;s vacuum packed, you&#039;re taking the chance of a package getting held up randomly one day and that extra day allows it to start stinking inside the facility. That&#039;s attention you DON&#039;T want!

				TAILS is good, I&#039;d look into it if I were you.<br /><br />Failing that, then you could keep everything SR-related on an encrypted USB stick. For this all your apps would have to be portable, but that&#039;s possible.<br /><br />Another useful piece of software to look into is Keepass which allows you to create and use very secure passwords without having to remember them.

It can generate secure passwords for you, hold the url to silkroad, hold your passwords and pin numbers all on a separate USB drive so you can take that extra step.<br /><br />I&#039;m setting up a small linux box to be a dedicated TAILS box since it&#039;s a pain to run it off USB on Mac.

				maybe im missing something, but wouldnt using a bootable cd/dvd of tails be better than a usb drive...<br />the optical media for sure cant be written to while you use thus ensuring nothing is left behind?

Carrying on about whatever on the clearnet with your normal browser, and in the VM of Tails do all the Tor related things.

				Try to keep as much to yourself as possible. Don&#039;t tell anyone anything they don&#039;t need to know. A lot of people seem to get into trouble by bragging or getting into fights with frriends/lovers.

				Thank you EVERYONE for you responses. I read up on TAILS and will be utilizing it ASAP! <br /><br />I absolutely LOVE this! A whole Fucking community dedicated to help me fly the middle finger high to the nosy ass government!<br />I wished for something like this a few years ago, unaware that it already existed!<br /><br />
