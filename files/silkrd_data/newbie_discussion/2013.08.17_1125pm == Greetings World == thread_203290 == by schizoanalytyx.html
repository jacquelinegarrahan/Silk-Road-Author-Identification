				Greetings fellow travelers of the silken road, <br /><br />i want to introduce myself as a newbie. I have only recently discovered this wonderful site and forum, and much admire what i have read about the Dreaded Pirate! <br /><br />It is my search for acid that has led me to this site, though it is something i have never done before. Like the majority of the mainstream public i have grown up with distorted and misinformed advice about the dangers of such &quot;chemicals&quot;, such that i have only smoked cannabis for the last 15 years in terms of any form of recreational psychotropic substance. <br /><br />However over the last 5 years working in my neuroscience career, i have become more and more aware of the real scientific evidence for its uses and its so called dangers. Inspired by such great men like Rick Doblin of MAPS fame, I decided i owed it to myself as a student of the human mind to explore the furthest boundaries of my psychedelic conscious.&nbsp; <br /><br />However as i had found to my dismay, in the &quot;mainstream public&quot; it is rather difficult to get hold of acid these days! So now i have just joined Silkroad, learnt about bitcoins, bought my first couple, transferred it between a number of wallets, learnt about PGP and i have just placed my first order with a vendor who seems to value quality over quantity so am eagerly anticipating to see how this all pans out. <br /><br />I welcome all correspondence from people who have an interest in psychedelia, particularly new explorers like myself. I look forward to discussing and reviewing experiences and sharing in the self discovery with anyone who might find this interesting. <br /><br />here&#039;s to (hopefully) good times! ;D

				I&#039;ve gone with a vendor called SYnthesiswizard, and am hoping I wont its worth the punt with choosing someone who is relatively new. Can anyone recommend any particular vendors, ideally in the UK?
