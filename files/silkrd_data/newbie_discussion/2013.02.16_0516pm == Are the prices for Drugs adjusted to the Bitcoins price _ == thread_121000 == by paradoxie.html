				I asked this a while back and sr support replied this<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do offer that feature for vendors, they have the choice to peg their listings to the USD so the price of their listing will adjust depending on the exchange rate.<br /><br />User&#039;s with less than 50 posts are now confined to the &quot;Newbie&quot; section.<br /><br />~SR Support<br /><br />The second answer was a question about posting and the newbie thread had just been started. Anyway the seller has the option to do it or not to.
