				Hello everyone! sorry if my English is not very good, I use a translator. Veloc0875 nickname and I&#039;m delighted to be on the Silk Road, I think we all need to care for it to last forever. MY question is if you they think it can influence the effects of pure cocaine that coca plant variety was obtained. If so which do you think that is the best choice .. it would be very difficult to achieve a cocaine so in particular because in all producing countries are the different varieties of plants, but would know where you choose better. once read that the best is a variety that creze in peru I do not remember what it was. and another question .. if they think it the variety of the plant from which cocaine is extracted influences the effects, you think that the finishing and processing of cocaine if it influences? (Type of chemicals used) They say the best cocaine in effects is very flaky and shiny look .. then I would like to know your experience and if they think it conocimentos which influences the effect and quality of cocaine is only puereza or what is also processing or you think that also can influence what type of coca plant from which was extracted . which is for you the best cocaine? that producing country? Colombia, Bolivia, Peru? and that aspect? flaky, not as flaky or less influence? am not a salesman but I would like to help raise the maximum level of demand so that we know best which is most perfect cocaine and disfrutemeos! I think the best has to be pure cocaine, scaly and shiny, possibly peru although I doubt as more refined and the best way, with the best products and most chemicals clean as possible, I hope your opinion!! greetings!
