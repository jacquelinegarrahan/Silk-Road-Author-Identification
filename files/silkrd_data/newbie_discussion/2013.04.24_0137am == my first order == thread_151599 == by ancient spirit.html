				yo, sup SR!<br />finally my first order. i ordered weed and some oil. i think i&#039;ve done all right, but it is still processing after 24 hours.<br /><br />I found really confusing the way to send the address. the dealer says:&quot;use www.cryptobin.org to send your shipping info &quot;. so i went there, put my address, etc than i pasted the url and the pass in the order form. Is this correct? I mean, if i&#039;m giving away the pass and url what&#039;s the point to use an external place to put the address?<br /><br />With the other dealer, I just sent my addy via the order form at SR checkout. Is that wrong? hope not.<br /><br />also about this pgp key, what da heck...I don&#039;t have a clue what is that nor how to use it.yes, read, read. but i didn&#039;t, lol. I think this is not well done at SR at all. if sr wants ppl to use these keys, they should have a manual at hand or something.<br />

				Honestly, you shouldn&#039;t be using privnote or some other third party site to send your address to the vendor.&nbsp; It is quite safe to use the SR order box to enter your address as the address is erased the minute the transaction is completed.&nbsp; The vendor must cut and paste the address to their system and they are supposed to get rid of it after they have addressed your envelope.<br /><br />If you are concerned that somehow someone is going to crack SR and someway be able to find your address then you should use the vendors PGP key to encrypt the address and paste the encrypted text into the SR address box.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with PGP go to the SR wiki where you will find information on the what, where and how of PGP.&nbsp; There is also I believe a thread on the forums explaining how to use PGP as well.<br /><br />

				Use liberte linux, the gpg key program is simple to handle. You create a document with a .gpg extension with the public key in it (like a notepad document). Then you import that document using the tool with the button &lt;import&gt;. Then, you open the clipboard, write your address and encrypt it with the key you have imported. Then you just copy the set of caracters it gives you.

				if your running windows download gpg4win. the program is called kleopatra and it comes with a GPA(assistant) that makes it a snap. it took me 20 min to figure it out and im by no means the most fluent computer user. dont use privnote or go to an external site and input info!!!!!!!!<br />just ask the vendor for their public key. If they dont offer it i wouldnt use them. Be safe man.

				There&#039;s a noob&#039;s guide to PGP stickied on this very forum. There&#039;s a really easy to follow guide and then you can post your key and you can send you messages back and forth using PGP... Its a really useful way to spend 20 mins and you get closer to that magic #50 post. Never send your address unencrypted
