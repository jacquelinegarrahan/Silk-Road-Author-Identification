				heya basically i ordered something from china and my guy sent threw ems/parcelforce it arrived in england about a week ago and seems to be stuck. i entered the tracking for one of the parcels and this is what it said<br /><br /><br />but then for another one that i sent to somewhere else it says this<br /><br /><br />im starting to think it has bee caught and they are preparing for controlled deliverys as i have not received any letter threw the post saying that your item has been seized but would like a second opinion as i am unsure if this is the case.

				You need to:<br /><br />- Delete the dates and times ASAP.<br />- Clean house, thoroughly.&nbsp; No bongs, no wrappers, nothing.<br />- Don&#039;t sign for any mail, obviously<br /><br />Did you order in your name?&nbsp; And was it a large quantity (without going into details)?&nbsp; If it wasn&#039;t a large quantity there&#039;s a good chance they&#039;d just dispose of it.<br />

				Not to incite you to panic or be offensive or anything but it was really stupid to check the tracking info let alone post it and you&#039;ve put both yourself and your vendor at risk. If I were a vendor I personally would exercise caution around you in the future based on that alone. There are some great threads in the Shipping section about this same topic and reducing your chances of a seizure. For one thing, never check tracking unless absolutely necessary/you think you&#039;re being scammed. And even then caution should be exercised, it shouldn&#039;t be checked over tor, and it should be checked sparingly. I hope things work out for you, they probably will and if it got seized then they&#039;ll likely dispose of it if it&#039;s a small amount like has been said. If it was a large amount cover your tracks, clean house and deny everything. Don&#039;t talk to anyone other than your attorney. In the US at least, the burden of proof is on THEM, not you. You don&#039;t have to prove you didn&#039;t order it as much as they have to prove that you did. <br /><br />Whether this works out or not please exercise more caution in the future. This is a high risk community in all honesty and we do have to look out for one another on some level, no matter how naive it may seem to think that people in the &quot;underground&quot; do this we do. By using safer practices in buying and communicating you reduce risk for yourself and also do us a solid by reducing risk for us.
