				What is speed paste? I see that post up once and a while, mostly by the dutch homies. I assume its some type of amphetamine base substance. Is it really the consistency of paste? Is it for shooting?

				It&#039;s just amphetamine sulphate. Usually cut with solvents so that it has a pastey consistency. <br /><br />It&#039;s a eu thing, not common anywhere else

				This is the shit sold all over Europe, being passed off as &quot;amphetamine.&quot;<br />It is mostly wet (adds weight) and you have to dry it. It will never exceed a purity of 72%.<br />It works for such tiring tasks like installing a printer on a Windoze network etc&nbsp; :D

				I&#039;m curious too.<br /><br />I just bought Arigolo speed pills from Canada.&nbsp; They are great.&nbsp; They are cooked into a few different kinds of amphetamines for a full spectrum of effects. <br /><br />Does anyone know why the pharmaceutical speed pills (adderall, Ritalin, etc) are so much more than the speed paste and street speed?&nbsp; The active ingredients are the same in some cases and so much more for your money buying street speed.&nbsp; So much cheaper.&nbsp; <br /><br />I almost bought&nbsp; Dexadrine tablets containing 5mg dextrose-amphetamine each for $11.45 .&nbsp; Compare that to 40-50mg of dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and others for about $2.50 each<br />At the end of the day , it&#039;s the same stuff. Just take less of it or whatever.<br /><br />Also, if anyone knows if you can IV speed at all?&nbsp; &nbsp;I figured no because most speed is less than 70% pure at best because of synthesis limitations naturally.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I guess this where methamphetamine comes in ?&nbsp; It can be cooked into 90+% pure crystal and can be IVd ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone please clarify.&nbsp; Or if any speed , paste or otherwise can be made to shoot safely ?<br /><br />I can&#039;t help but wonder why the speed paste is still wet ?&nbsp; Why do people put up with that?&nbsp; Dry it yourself, as if.&nbsp; &nbsp; So you can&#039;t shoot it, snort it because its moist and has harsh solvents still in it.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t sound right.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also,&nbsp; there is a Canadian vendor who sells paste too.&nbsp; That stuff looks dry and crumbly like dried toothpaste.&nbsp; I might buy this one out of curiosity.<br /><br />Those crazy Europeans and their wet speed paste!&nbsp; &nbsp;Fetish or something .

				Damn Jediknight you were on a good one when you wrote that post. You brought up some good points. The price of adderall is quite expensive. But its not too much more expensive then getting at a pharmacy without insurance. Maybe .50 to 1.50 more on SR. This is just a case of big pharma hiking prices because they know people will still buy it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you can IV powdered speed, but you can definitely IV methamphetamine. Done it a couple times mixed with some heroin, it was pretty nuts. <br /><br />As for speed paste your right. If its just speed that needs to be dried out then it shouldn&#039;t be sold in that form. Please vendors dry your speed paste.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I always assumed speed is wet when it is initially synthesized, and that this is called paste. Then once it has dried out and been cut it is just called speed. I could very well be wrong about that, but the people I have known who sold speed said when they get it it is wet and much stronger and they let it dry out and cut it with glucose. I don&#039;t doubt there are people taking shit speed, moistening it up with a solvent or something and then passing that off as paste... or maybe that really is all that paste is. Can anyone who actually knows for sure weigh in, cos I&#039;m curious myself now (i.e someone knows the consistency of freshly synthesized amphetamine sulphate)

				I would also like to know if there is a certain type of Meth or amount to buy that will give similar effects to adderall minus the cost.
