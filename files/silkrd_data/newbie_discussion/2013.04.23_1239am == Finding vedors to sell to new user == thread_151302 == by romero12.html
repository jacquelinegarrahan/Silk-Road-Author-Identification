				Is there any simple way of filtering results to find sellers willing to sell to new buyers?

				No, ya just gotta do the legwork and read their vendor pages. A lot will sell to noobs but will require FE. That can be chancy but read reports on this forum, as well as the vendor pages and you will get a good feel for the ones you can trust with an FE. Some will do it no FE too.

				Not that I know of, but your best bet is to research, look at their stats, and FE to the reputable ones.&nbsp; I was knew not too long ago and had to FE for my first few transactions and take the risk, but I made sure first that the seller was EXTREMELY reliable.&nbsp; You shouldn&#039;t have any problems purchasing.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that some may want you to start small.&nbsp; Trying to make a large purchase early is the signal of a scammer.<br />&nbsp;<br />Hope that helps

				Hi. I&#039;m a new vendor. I have coke listings shipping within Canada. I won&#039;t ask you to FE.<br />The link to my vendor page is in my sig.<br /><br />I also started a thread here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151401.0

				Thanks guys for your help. Yes, I&#039;ve heard good things about spacewrangler...if i&#039;m not mistaken, his page does mention not selling to noobs with no transaction history. I&#039;ll double check though. And yes I&#039;ve heard nod has awesome product....and that it&#039;s very expensive. Thanks again, guys.
