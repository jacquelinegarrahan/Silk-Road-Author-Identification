				OK i really hope i am wrong about this and i held off writing this for a while but i think some scamming might be going on!<br />I believe that PDS was hacked he told me himself in emails about 3-4 days ago.His BMR account was also updated today telling no one to go there and that his webmaster took over his site however.....<br /><br />I made an order with him last week after doing some research.I seen some bad feedback a couple months ago due to sickness or something but was led to believe it was under new management.This was my very first order and his prices were lower than some of the more tried and true vendor&#039;s.I did message a couple vendors saying i was giving him a try one said he was good people the other said he was not(Got this message after i all ready ordered).<br />I made the order on his webstore so i know there is no way i will get a refund from SR or anything like that but this order was in advance of him being suspended the first time.He was really great with responding and everything always answered all my questions i was really stoked.I asked him for tracking a couple times but when he responded he never said anything and i did not want to mettle.Well the day it was supposed to show up tues-wed i outright asked for tracking he gave me an excuse and the next morning he messaged me saying they sent the package back because he got the address wrong.He said he payed 70$for next day and it would be here thursday friday for SURE!again i asked for tracking but got nothing.he was in contact with me up until wed but since then has gone dark. Thur came and nothing and then Fri nadda.<br />I was in contact with him the whole time through his problems.He was suspended the first time on the weekend i believe for advertising his webstore on SR and bypassing fee&#039;s.He was reinstated early this week as he shut his webstore down then he was suspended again and this is when he got hacked.I have emails from him on his webstore on tormail and on SR detailing the whole thing he wont answer me.He has also been on his BMR account on the 19(today) and added an update for people to not go to his webstore i had a friend message him there so pretty sure he is just avoiding me.I have since been in contact with one other user who had an order from last week that never arrived and i have been toldd there are some from this week but that may be due to the person who took over his account.<br /><br />I hope i am wrong i hope he comes on here and explains or mails me and tells me wht is going on but i have no other explanation.To top it all off i was buying my friends methadone carries but they got taken away i was really counting on order to get me through.I have not had anything since wed and am sicker than a fucking dog.The order was for 1g #4Heroin and was 250$.Believe it or not i know some of his customers probably wont but it is the truth and i do have all of our correspondence.
