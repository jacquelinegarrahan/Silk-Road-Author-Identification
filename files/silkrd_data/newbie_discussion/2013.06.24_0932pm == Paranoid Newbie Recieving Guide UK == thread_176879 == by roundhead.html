				I am new to Silk Road and spent a month lurking before making my first purchases two weeks ago and now could not be happier with the results. My main problem was having the balls to actually make the order as I live with my girlfriend who would leave me if she found out I had been sending anything to the house and also my work would 99.9% sack me if I was arrested for drug possession, mix these two factors together and you get me- the most paranoid fucker ever. <br /><br />In my month gathering information on the forum and researching a few aspects myself I have found a system which for me has been hassle free and left me feeling completely relaxed about ordering from the site, now this has worked for me but if anyone would like to add any information they have gathered themselves the more the merrier and we can keep one step ahead at all times.<br /><br />1.Establish the Buyer- The first part of my journey was the easiest establish a buyer, now for me this was very very easy, I just looked on the best selling products page and selected one of the members from there with positive feedback who was based in the UK (as had found out nearly impossible being seized UK to UK for small amounts). I would venture now and try some of the less established sellers but for the first purchase I wanted it to be a smooth one and decided to go with a trusted source.<br /><br />2.Uploading Funds- Again paranoia setting in I wanted nothing at all to ever be able to be traced back to my name which is near impossible until I found the life line I needed in the last place I&#039;d ever think of looking POUNDLAND for a measly £3, Yes that&#039;s right my local pound store sold the IBUX card (link below) this little beauty saved me. It is a card you can make purchases online with and the best thing about it is that it does not have your name on it or have to be registered in your name making uploading your coins fear free. I know some of you may not like the fact that there is a maximum £150 load but remember this is for starters and if you pay £5 more you can upload a maximum of £3200. (THE CARD IS ALSO URGENT FOR LATER ON).<br /><br />http://ibux.co.uk/about-us.html<br /><br />3.Finding a drop point- This section you will need to buy a cheap throw away phone (ASDA £5 my source) and have a throw away SIM card with some credit (ASDA again £5) and your card from earlier. I had been racking my brains for ages from paying a friend, to looking up For Sale houses walking around knocking door to door until finding one that&#039;s empty, but then came across the most convenient stress free solution. MyByBox (link below) is a service where across the country for £2.50 per package you have it sent to a bank of lockers(usually in supermarkets), where someone signs for it for you, puts it in the locker, and texts you the locker code to the mobile you provided when it&#039;s ready to collect all you need to do is register online and with the debit card you purchased earlier all you now have to do is type in a fake name and there in no link what so ever, you get the text when your parcel arrives you go and collect it (or pay some hoods you see outside the store a bottle of vodka to go collect it if its a big order as I will be next time). <br /><br />http://my.bybox.com/<br /><br />4.Reward yourself your hard works paid off- For me this was going home, snorting my 2g of mind blowing cocaine, destroying the girlfriend&#039;s punani (claiming it was all natural) then taking a well deserved Diazepam whilst searching Silk Road for more suppliers.<br /><br />I know this may seem paranoid to a lot of you but for those of you who have crazy girlfriends, jobs where you cant take the risk, live with parents, have had bad experiences with the current address or are just a paranoid fuck I&#039;m sure this will be a life saver as it was for me. Any feedback would be appreciated and for anyone looking for advice on first time orders please let me know, I know I may be new but seriously the amount I have thought about this the past month I have covered every possible scenario.<br /><br />Good luck guys and girls and honestly the reward is worth the hard work.

				Nice guide. I have two comments:<br /><br />1) If I was a hood and someone offered me a bottle of vodka to go and pick up a package, I&#039;d accept, then probably run away with the package or something. It is a clear indication that the package contains something I&#039;d want to keep for myself.<br /><br />2) Would your wife still leave you now she&#039;s seen what you&#039;re *really* capable of in bed? Get her on it too. There&#039;s nothing better than a coked up woman. So I hear.
