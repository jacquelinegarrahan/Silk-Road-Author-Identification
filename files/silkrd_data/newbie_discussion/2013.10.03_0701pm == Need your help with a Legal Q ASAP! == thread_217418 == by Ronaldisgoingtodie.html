				Okay so a close friend of mine recently got into some legal trouble and has asked me to inquire here about whether or not what occured is legal on the LE&#039;s part. <br /><br />He wrecked his girlfriends car &amp; had 4 packages on him stamped &amp; sealed w/ address on them as if he was about to send them. Could a cop search his mail without a federal search warrent?<br /><br />Because thats what happened, and he wants to know if his mail was illegally searched. Claims that if it was hes off free.

				I have no idea about the truth of that, however, it may be the case that until the mail is in the hands of a mailing service it is not mail. As in it might need some sort of postmark.<br /><br />Food for thought, but I hope it was already considered mail.<br /><br />Cheers.
