				It&#039;s really too bad there&#039;s no way to verify age on the Road. Nobody should be sending drugs to any kids, thats anyone under 18. I guess , by law, someone is an adult at 18 but I think it takes well into your 20&#039;s to start thinking with something close to responsibility.

				*sigh*. I suppose you have to let the young&#039;uns have their fun too. I can see how at 16 you&#039;d be so dumb so as to read about SR, go online in the forums and imagine an online dealer would agree to meet you in person. I was so stupid when I was that age I used to go around my dealer&#039;s house in my school uniform and I didn&#039;t really get it when he&#039;d be mad at me for it. :-/<br /><br />The exquisitely beautiful stupidity of youth. <br /><br />And benzos? Yes, youth&#039;s wasted on the young.<br /><br />And to OP: Stay in school!
