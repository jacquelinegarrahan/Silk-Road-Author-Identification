				LOGGING IN<br /><br />&nbsp;In the url box, enter http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion This will take you to Silk Road&#039;s login page, which is very minimal. <br />Click &#039;click here to join&#039;.&nbsp; <br />GET A PIECE OF PAPER OUT AND WRITE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DOWN!&nbsp; <br />Create a user name and password that you have never used anywhere else. Write it down. Now create a PIN that you have never used before. Write that down too. Write that down too. Write that down too. <br />Fill out the captcha and click Go. Welcome to Silk Road.<br /><br />Take a Minute and thank the digital underground, It&#039;s like an Aladdin&#039;s cave of drugs down here, isn&#039;t it? For now, just have a look at everything that&#039;s on sale and bask in awe at the sheer variety on offer.<br /><br />Note:&nbsp; silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br />AVOID PHISHING SITES!! NEVER ENTER YOUR PIN TO LOG IN! Anything besudes the above is PHISHing, Be Warned!<br />The only time you enter your PIN is To send/withdraw Bitcoins ($$$) to another wallet. (more on this later)<br /><br />NEW BUYERS<br /><br />As a new member your immediate goals should be:<br />&nbsp;<br />Download PGP (Windows users should use Gpg4win) and visit a thread on /r/Silkroad or on the Silkroad Forum to practice using it. (more on this later)<br /><br />Sign up for an account on the forum and start posting in the Newbie section to get your post count up to 50 so you can post elsewhere. There are usually threads in there dedicated to posting over and over to get your post count up. Or be like me and contribute to the eduction of the countless fucktards around you, who dont know how to read... <br /><br />Get familiar with the Rumor Mill section so you can browse vendor reviews by type of drug or DoC (Drug of Choice) and you can also search at the top of that section to find a specific vendor.<br />Note: Vendor feedback can be faked and is NOT to be trusted on its own. ONLY order from reputable vendors in the forum from people with enough posts. This will take longer but it is how you have 100% successful orders . Don&#039;t give up! Dont be lazy, do your fucking homework!<br /><br />Some vendors will ask you to FE (Finalize Early) but you should NEVER under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES do this unless you are willing to part with your money. It doesn&#039;t matter how reputable the vendor is. In fact, the more reputable and the more transactions they have, then the easier it would be for them to rip you off, get away with it, and barely have their feedback affected!<br />Vendors who have been there for more than 6 months and have over 100 transactions are very likely to be reputable, but still check the forums and DON&#039;T FE!!!<br /><br />TIPS &amp; TRICKS <br /><br />Go into your account settings and have it display amounts in US dollars instead of BTC (bitcoins); the prices become much more obvious.<br /><br />Use vendors that use the escrow ( 3rd party money holder) system. Escrow is there to protect you from getting scammed (by handing the BTCs temporarily to silkroad, and waiting until you get the package before finalization, after which the BTCs are now irreversibly handed to the seller, but in event of not receiving the package you can claim your money back or settle a partial refund with the seller), and early finalization means you&#039;re putting up yourself to be scammed (not always). THAT being said, if you&#039;re a new user with zero purchase history, chances are most vendors will ask you to finalize early as it is somewhat easy for buyers to abuse the escrow system and scam the sellers (i.e. receive the drugs, claim they didn&#039;t get it, and claim a refund), so you may want to only go with vendors with &gt;97% feedback so you can at least be reasonably confident they won&#039;t scam you even if you finalize early and are just doing it for their own protection.<br /><br />Don&#039;t bother buying a bunch of small/cheap things to get your transaction count up. Vendors can see how much you&#039;ve spent and scammers do this as well. It will do nothing but waste your and there time and money.<br /><br />When browsing drugs or other products, there is a checkbox at the top for domestic only, (imho)It&#039;s better to buy things from within your country for obvious reasons - they don&#039;t have to go through customs (so are less likely to be seized) and they arrive quicker) Don&#039;t rule out international sellers, though. Some of the best stuff can only be bought elsewhere, just understand that customs is involved. <br />you can also sort by relevance, vendor feedback, new vendors, as well<br /><br />You cannot FE if the vendor is brand new. Vendors have to go through a process before they can sell on SR (I once heard they have to pay $500 or something, someone can chime in here). So if you have some BTC (bitcoins) to spare then you can try one of them also and if they never deliver, then just never finalize so your bitcoins go back into YOUR wallet. I&#039;d recommend a reputable vendor first though<br /><br />Once you place an order, you cannot cancel it for 4 days. So check to make sure the vendor is alive and active by looking at their feedback and it wouldn&#039;t hurt to send them a private message to guage their response time. But don&#039;t flood them, there working people like everyone else, maybe a PM a couple days after to check and see if everyone&#039;s still alive.<br /><br />Clicking the vendor&#039;s name takes you to their profile where you can see ALL of their listings and it shows you when they were last active.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE***&nbsp; 6 Part Step By Step Clearnet Informative Guide, From Navag.

				Security considerations<br /><br />As safe as Tor and SR is, you need to realize that the DEA and other agencies have been well-aware of SR for quite some time now. There is no telling what resources they may put into cracking down on it and contrary to popular belief, it is not impossible to be busted on SR. Please take all necessary security precautions to stay safe.<br /><br />&nbsp;• Addresses you send get deleted but your information is only as safe as your vendor is! And if SR were to ever be discovered and raided, or hacked by a 3rd-party, any information could become publicly available and exist on the Internet forever. This is very unlikely to occur but it&#039;s at least worth mentioning. ALWAYS use PGP or Privnote!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;• Do not be worried about buying bitcoins. It is not illegal and plenty of legitimate online stores take bitcoin payments. If you are already under investigation, it could raise further suspicion but at that point, it wouldn&#039;t be the bitcoins you should be worried about!<br /><br />&nbsp;• Use your real name and address on orders and do not order to a vacant house and I would personally recommend against a PO box. You can never be 100% sure how well the vendor will package your drugs and if it&#039;s something like weed then having the cops there waiting for you to pick up your mail so they can bust you at the Post office would probably cause a few problems in your life and make you look like a fool.<br /><br />In my opinion, the name that the drugs are ordered to is irrelevant in most situations. I think you&#039;re much more likely to get busted OUTSIDE of a mail delivery setting (like getting stopped with drugs on you, while high, etc), than to actually get a &quot;controlled delivery.&quot; Use your real name, mainly to draw less attention to the envelope in the first place, and also because when the cops knock on your door, they don&#039;t give a fuck who&#039;s name is on the envelope if it&#039;s in your hand. If it was addressed to John Doe, but you opened it and did the drugs inside, all that proves is that you open other people&#039;s mail.<br /><br />Don&#039;t put someone else&#039;s name on it (who actually exists) without their permission, or you are a fucking dirtbag. I&#039;ve read several different people talking about how they used their parents names, or their grandmas name (because obviously she wouldn&#039;t order drugs and they&#039;d never arrest her! Bullshit.) Don&#039;t do it, it will not help you, and it could GREATLY fuck up someone&#039;s life. <br /><br />Note; The PO Box. Technique : The argument behind it is that you&#039;ve essentially gone out of your way to have a delivery spot ( The PO Box) exclusively for drugs, if you&#039;re opening one just for SR purposes. Whereas if you send to your home address, you just get the packages/envelopes/whatever along with the rest of your mail. It&#039;s much less conspicuous, and there&#039;s really no way for any sort of LE ( Law Enforcement) to prove that it was you that ordered the drugs.<br />Also, it&#039;s simply unnecessary. Either way, you&#039;re getting drugs sent to an address that is under your name or in some way associated with you. So why go out of your way to secure a PO box when you could just have them sent to your <br /><br />No matter what you use, the seller is going to have to have your address at some point. Even if you encrypt it with PGP, it needs to be decrypted. Your address is only as safe as the seller makes it. If they keep your address stored somewhere, encrypted or not, it is always possible for law enforcement to get it. Obviously, it&#039;s safer if it&#039;s encrypted but it might be possible for law enforcement to get the decryption key from the seller or make them give it up if they&#039;re busted.Anyway, chances of that are slim. Most sellers don&#039;t keep addresses on file. ( I mean their drug dealers right )<br /><br /><br />If you want to learn PGP go look in the SilkRoad forums in the Newbie section and there is also a thread in /r/SilkRoad somewhere. If you&#039;re still stuck I could post directions when I get the time.<br /><br />• Vendors sell their accounts sometimes when they are done. Another reason to never FE. Also, who knows if they got busted and law enforcement wants to fish for their customer base. (Very unlikely and probably not worth mentioning, but might as well).<br /><br />So how does this relate to SR?<br /><br />You get caught having drugs delivered to your house. You are in possession of drugs. Whether it is through a controlled delivery, a raid after they get a tip from the post office, is irrelevant at this point. You will be charged with drug possession, and you will spend AT LEAST three days in jail before ANY decisions are made (if you don&#039;t bail out, which will cost you 10% of your actual bail amount All the cops have to prove is that you have drugs in your hand/pocket/car/house/body in order to take you to jail, anything else is not their job. If you have a public defender representing you, he is not going to have this big elaborate case made out for you. He is going to tell you to accept the first deal they give you (this part varies from state to state, in some states you can go to prison for having a joint on you, I am fortunate enough to live in CA where drug laws are extremely lax and focused more on rehabilitation to make room for all of our real criminals in our overcrowded prison system) so that he can move onto the next case. <br /><br />Why are people here so mean to newbies?<br /><br />I think it has something to do with all of the beginners guides we are pumping out. It used to take a certain kind of sneaky/street-smart person to buy drugs, and now any 12 year old with an internet connection can jump into the underground. <br /><br />See, drugs used to be a lifestyle, it used to take time to find the right drugs, a good connect, etc. You had to get burned a few times, and believe me there is no fucking &quot;Resolution/Refund Center&quot; on the streets. It took a certain kind of person to go downtown and find a way to get their shit, to learn respect for drug dealers, how to interface with criminals, how NOT to put themselves in sketchy situations and get robbed, beat up, or worse (and we learn this by making these mistakes on our own, and then not doing it again,)<br /><br />&nbsp;So now we have a bunch of people who have completely skipped that part of Drug Use 101, who can sit at their computer in the comfort of their own home and order whatever they want delivered to their door. So you have a bunch of entitled kiddos, who haven&#039;t earned their stripes, who expect the mail on time, would shit their pants if a cop ever came to their door (much less run from them, lie to them, etc), and who cry about &quot;he scammed me I want my money back!&quot; who are dabbling in illegal stuff. Guess what, you&#039;re gonna get burned in the drug game, and you&#039;re gonna probably eventually get arrested, because that&#039;s what happens when you do illegal shit, but they just don&#039;t understand this.<br /><br />

				Now for the Fun Stuff, Buying Bitcoins<br /><br />Quoted from Dr.Jay<br /><br />- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br /><br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br /><br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br /><br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br /><br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br /><br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re <br />&quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br /><br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br /><br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br /><br />-- Use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br /><br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br /><br />In other words,&nbsp; right above the search box on the SR homepage , click on account. In large letters, you&#039;ll see your account&#039;s bitcoin address. Send your cart&#039;s grand total of bitcoins to your Silk Road bitcoin address. [Note that it may take hours for your coins to show up in Silk Road. Don&#039;t panic, I promise they are not lost.] Once the coins show up in your account, you are ready to to buy.<br /><br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />EDIT: <br /><br />The Wall : Buying BitCoin<br /><br />Heres a 4min video made by a sexy friend of mine, with video instruction on How to use bitinstant and CVS to purchase coin, a lot of good information for first time buyers and the method CVS uses. Enjoy!<br /><br />http://vimeo.com/44849463<br /><br />More on buying Bitcoin &lt;ClearNet&gt;<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyoasFP_ENY<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSmxbtFQlmg<br /><br />Encrypting Your Address<br />&nbsp;<br />[This is important so that ONLY your vendor has access to your personal information.]<br /><br />&nbsp;• We need software that will handle the PGP encryption protocol. In your regular browser on the clearnet, go to &#039;http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html or gpg4win.org/index.html .The latest stable version is what you want and it usually has a green box around it. (Full version) Download and install it but when you get to the Choose Components page, only select GnuPG, Kleopatra, and Gpg4win Compendium. Install those components.<br /><br />How to use PGP Video:<br />&nbsp;youtube.com/watch?v=SywCI91kfq0<br /><br />&nbsp;• Next, open Kleopatra. If it doesn&#039;t ask you already, you need to create a new OpenPGP key pair. (File --&gt; New Certificate)<br />&nbsp;For your name, enter your Silk Road user name.<br />&nbsp;For the email address, simply write &#039;&lt;user name&gt;@silkroad.onion&#039;. [The email address does not have to be valid.]<br />&nbsp;Click Next, Create Key. Kleopatra will ask you for a passphrase for this key. Choose one that you&#039;ve never used before and Write It Down. Kleopatra will then make your key pair.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Next step is to import your vendor&#039;s public key.<br /><br />&nbsp;•Go back to Tor Browser and back to Silk Road. Find your product (check your cart) and click the vendor&#039;s name. On the vendor&#039;s profile page he or she should list their GPG public key. It will start off titled:<br />&nbsp;-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- and the key will look like gibberish. Copy everything from:<br />&nbsp;-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- to<br />&nbsp;-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----, INCLUDING the begin and end lines. You want and need it all for it to work. Copy the key to your clipboard. (Ctrl+C or right click --&gt; copy)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;•In your system tray, Kleopatra will have an icon. Right click the icon --&gt; Clipboard --&gt; Certificate Import. That will import the vendor&#039;s public key.<br /><br />Now you are ready to encrypt your address.<br /><br />&nbsp;• Open up Notepad (Win+R --&gt; notepad) Type your address as it would appear on a letter. This is what your vendor will see. Double check that your address IS correct. (Seriously, do it.) Copy your address to the clipboard.<br />&nbsp;Right click Kleopatra&#039;s tray icon, Clipboard, Encrypt. Here you choose who you would like to send the info to. [Remember ONLY the recipient can decrypt your message]<br />&nbsp;Click Add Recipient and select your vendor&#039;s key.<br />&nbsp;Click Next and Kleopatra will encrypt your address.<br />&nbsp;Click Ok.<br /><br />&nbsp;• Now go back to Notepad. Paste what is on your clipboard. (Ctrl+V, Right click --&gt; Paste) Your address is now encrypted in a way that ONLY your vendor can decrypt. To anyone else, your address is gibberish<br /><br />Completing The Transaction<br />&nbsp;<br />Now that you have your encrypted address, go back to your cart. In the box asking for your address, paste your encrypted address. Enter your PIN (that you wrote down) and click &#039;place order&#039;. That&#039;s it!<br /><br />• Purchases<br />&nbsp;<br />So you placed your order! Now the order will be &#039;Processing&#039;. The vendor will get the order fill it and ship it. Once that happens, it will be marked as &#039;In Transit&#039;, which is self-explanatory. Once your order arrives, mark the transaction as &#039;finalized&#039; and leave feedback to the vendor. Do not forget to do this because SR tracks how frequently you let transactions auto-finalize. (Vendors see this info when you order [citation needed] and may reject your order if your rate is high.<br /><br />While purchasing IS illegal it is unlikely to be monitored or traced back to you if you have taken all the security considerations and done your vendor homework, look for stealth, the best shipping methods&nbsp; you can find,&nbsp; reviews, warnings and alternatives. seriously the message boards will be your biggest time + money saver and will put you on the right path.<br /><br />• Messaging / Finalizing<br />&nbsp;<br />Yes, things take ages on the silk road- but if your experience is like mine, drugs are unfortunately just as slow in real life. Vendors can and will take 24 hours to process orders or message you, don&#039;t start worrying until it&#039;s been more than a few days.<br /><br />Don&#039;t bother vendors with small questions or ask for constant updates. they&#039;re busy people. message them when they ask you to message back (for finalizing or confirming you&#039;re alive<br /><br />Finalizing early means you immediately release bitcoins to the vendor before receiving the product (a sign of trust on your end or distrust on theirs). Finalizing early is the most likely way to make sure your product doesn&#039;t get to your doorstep. please, please look at review threads, forum posts and ratings before choosing a vendor who will make you FE. some vendors are worth FE&#039;ing for, but they are few and far between. <br /><br />• Shipping<br />&nbsp;<br />Use your real name and real address. as torr points out, go to your post office/online and ask how to officially write your address (nothing suspicious about this) to accelerate sorting. This will maximize machine sorting, good routing, and minimize the number of people that have to intervene. I notice that what vendors say about how to write an address isn&#039;t the case in all countries. <br /><br />Always use PGP. if they don&#039;t have PGP you shouldn&#039;t be ordering from them<br /><br />Order domestic to expedite shipping- many offer next day delivery because there are no customs. <br /><br />Give it 3-4 days domestically before asking questions and AT LEAST a week/two weeks if internationally. stuff really does get lost or takes time to process. <br /><br />For international, 2-3 weeks is a minimum to wait. Sometimes it will be surprisingly fast, especially for letters, but sometimes things can take a while.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend for a first purchase ordering something that is actually legal. Find something cheap that you&#039;re interested in&nbsp; or might one day need like Books! This will help tp Find out if your package will require a signature or not. I wouldn&#039;t order from a vendor that sent packages requiring a signature. If your package arrives and a signature is requested,&nbsp; RED FLAG ! REJECT AND DENY, unless its not around the time you have ordered off the road. But during the wait for any SR mail, its not a bad idea, id rather loose some cookies from mom, than my freedom. <br />Keep a clean house. Nothing gets a home cleaner than an upcoming SR delivery. Keep a clean computer as well.<br /><br />Don&#039;t talk about SR or mail-order to others. What they don&#039;t know can&#039;t hurt them. <br /><br />Keep your postal workers happy and not suspicious. You don&#039;t want them feeling like they smoked up whenever you open your door. Getting to your mailbox shouldn&#039;t require going through an obstacle course.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />Returns<br /><br />Hedged / Unhedged payments - in terms of a refund should you require one. I see this question here countless times a day &quot;i paid 8btc and got a 50% refund, why did I only get 2btc&#039;s back?&quot; and people think they got ripped off, when really that 2btc is worth the 4btc when you bought. Similarly in reverse if the payment was unhedged and people get back the 4btc (in my example) and are confused about it being worth twice as much. (my example only works if the prices doubled in time you get to resolution - that has happened in the last few weeks to, so I expect more like this.) <br /><br /><br />

Guess what, you&#039;re gonna get burned in the drug game, and you&#039;re gonna probably eventually get arrested, because that&#039;s what happens when you do illegal shit, but they just don&#039;t understand this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^ what he said!<br /><br />I actually don&#039;t necessarily think that&#039;s a bad thing.

				Well done! +1 to you TurboBunny. <br /><br />Yes, vendors have to a pay a bond to be able to vend here, I believe it is exactly 500$.<br /><br />For anyone having issues with PGP, check out the Newbie PGP Club here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0<br /><br />And if you have any detailed questions, feel free to send me a PM! I am on here way more often than I should be, so you are likely to get a reply fairly quickly.<br /><br />Good luck and welcome to you all!<br /><br /><br />EDIT: The only thing I would recommend mentioning would be Bitfloor. Bitinstant seems to be gradually getting worse, and Mtgox is horrible for anonymity. For those of you with a Bank of America near by, using Bitfloor with cash deposit is MUCH more convenient than Bitinstant, and slightly cheaper as well.&nbsp;

				Amazing read. Very thorough and has answered a lot of questions I&#039;ve had. Only question I have is that is it fine to use blockchain instead and is there a decent tutorial on how to use it? Currently using Coinbase, but have heard bad things about it.

				I believe that any and all info we are looking for pertaining to Bitcoins will probably be found in another part of the forum or on r/bitcoin (clearnet) so one could check there, and any and all info that you may bring back, please feel free to post in this thread and I will update the above, so this post doesnt get cluttered like so many others.<br /><br />&nbsp;I would love to start a conversation here with anyone elses experiences with other bitcoin exchanges and details on the positives/negatives of those exchanges. Ease of use, and time of exchange. If you do have experiences with other exchanges, (and i mean from the deposit stage all the way to your Sr wallet ) please elaborate on why such exchange is good or bad, details people!<br /><br />I bet none of you ever thought, that just wanting to buy some books would lead you down the road to watching rising price trends on spread sheets for digital currency or learning how to be a crytocyberhippe... the times&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Keep this thread going viewers, please chime in with your Bitcoin experiences, we want to keep the information here alive and at the top...

From this point on it is fairly self explanatory. Once you have your deposit slip, go to the nearest BoA and fill out an out of state transfer slip. My experiences with the BoA staff have always been positive, they were extremely helpful guiding me through my first transaction with them.<br /><br />You should have the USD in your account by the time you get back, and from there you can have your btc within an hour by putting an order in on the exchange. <br /><br />Bitfloor is also TOR friendly. <br /><br />I had made several transactions with Bitinstant before trying Bitfloor, not only does Bitfloor have lower fees but the entire process had much less hassle than working through Moneygram and Zipzap.

				This information was fantastic. I myself am new but have come to SR to become a vendor(under the same name) not to buy. I have recently paid the fee to become a vendor and it is around $450. I believe this is actually very good as it deters people setting up fake accounts and listing bogus products. I look forward to becoming established on SR and supplying high quality products :D

				woah thx for that, really good guide, especially the hint to buy some legal stuff first, never thought about this!!!! <br /><br />Ive got one question, is there any way to buy bitcoins anonymously without using wallmart card? I am living in the EU and we dont have a wallmart, i know about localbitcoins.com but i wrote a trader if we could make a cash transaction and he did not answer (although he was online since then). So are there any other options to buy bitcoins without using my real name except localbitcoins/wallmart? would be great if anyone could help me with that!
