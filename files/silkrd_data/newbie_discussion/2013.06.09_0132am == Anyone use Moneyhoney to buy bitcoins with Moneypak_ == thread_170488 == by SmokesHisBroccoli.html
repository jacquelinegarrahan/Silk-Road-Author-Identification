				Just trying to get some feedback from anyone who used moneyhoney to purchase bitcoins using Moneypak?&nbsp; Was your transaction smooth?&nbsp; I figured I&#039;d give it a shot with their minimum of $100 since bitinstant is down for the weekend.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s risky so that&#039;s why I did the minimum.&nbsp; This person has a 100 rating and has been around 4 months, but I did a forum search and only found 1 thread mentioning this person.&nbsp; Thanks

				Follow up: Moneyhoney got me those btc&#039;s sonny!&nbsp; I wish I hadn&#039;t been so nervous but I&#039;m a worrier at heart.&nbsp; This was my first time not using bitinstant.&nbsp; I would use Moneyhoney again in the future to get bitcoins.&nbsp;

				Well I guess I got in right before the deadline.&nbsp; Already thinking about my next deposit, but I see moneyhoney really jacked up the juice.&nbsp; 20% on a small deposit like I was thinking.&nbsp; 5% special is over now.&nbsp; With the $5 money pack fee you could pay as much as $25 in fees for $100.&nbsp; Her fees go down the more&nbsp; you put in.&nbsp; Why not put in more then you ask?&nbsp; I&#039;m a very small time buyer and I don&#039;t want to have a bunch of bitcoins on hand and have to worry about them losing value.&nbsp;

				I know Moneyhoney has a good rep, but how long did it take you guys to get your btc?&nbsp; I placed an order when money was on, and i know this because i got a message as I was writing my message, that was about 7 hours ago... then again the profile does specify upto a full day or two...

				MoneyHoney was great while the 5% special lasted.&nbsp; But the rise in rates is too much for me; I will have to find someone new.&nbsp; It is regretable as MH has terrific service.

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />

				I used Moneyhoney to get bitcoins with Moneypak this week. She came through like a pro in about 12 hours. Most people report much faster times though, so maybe I just did my transaction at a odd time of the day. I would totally use her again!
