				New user here, really interested in the site.&nbsp; I just have a few questions for the community who uses this site.&nbsp; Will buyers ever approach you to sell you drugs?&nbsp; I&#039;d feel safer if a few drug dealers would msg me to let me know they&#039;re legit and tell me what they sell.&nbsp; Is there a way to access the addresses of users, don&#039;t want to get caught you know... Also, which dealers probably deal the most, and are any from the north western US?&nbsp; If possible, do dealers ever hand off drugs to buyers in person, that would be ideal for me.&nbsp; Lastly, how much do most dealers usually sell, just interested, thanks.

It&#039;s basically amazon or ebay or etzy for drugs. No one will approach you for anything. They will have listing with required feedback from buyers. Vendors will tell you what country they&#039;re from, but I&#039;ve never seen any local listings (which would actually be nice, but half of my quickest shipments came from the other coast, supposedly). Vendors will NEVER meet you in person. Forget it. If they did that they&#039;d be fucked. And so would you.<br /><br />Not a vendor myself, but I&#039;ve ordered large amounts of drugs before (got a couple friends together and we all ordered in bulk). I cleared out a vendor for about two weeks before he could get stuff back in stock. So given that, we&#039;re probably talking about a thousand dollars a week for some people. Can&#039;t imagine it can get to be much more. Vendors do well, but not as well as you&#039;d think they&#039;d do for the risk they take on and the skill, knowledge and professionalism required to business on a site like this.

				This is all very interesting. It is a shame that dealers won&#039;t meet in public, that would be convienent now with this current outage that is apparently happening.

You sound like a sketchy low class government official. But if not. Best thing for you right now that SR is down is to roam the forums. <br />

				If you are what you say you are, do a lot more reading of these forums. There are some great threads for newbies. The site being down makes this a great time to be doing&nbsp; a lot of necessary research, so you do not do a bone headed thing like arranging a meeting with a dealer you met on-line. No legit vendor is going to want to meet you. Anonymity is the foundation of this thing.

				Hey there, I&#039;m a newbie myself. Came here to stock up on some molly and LSD for some music festivals&nbsp; 8), I&#039;m tired of getting burned and dealing with sketchy folk. Can&#039;t wait till the sites back up!

				I have just started as well.<br />I have made a couple of orders, but I am still waiting to receive anything. I am in Aus so I expect they could take some time.<br />Anyone else ordered from Aus, if so what kind of delivery times did you have?<br />
