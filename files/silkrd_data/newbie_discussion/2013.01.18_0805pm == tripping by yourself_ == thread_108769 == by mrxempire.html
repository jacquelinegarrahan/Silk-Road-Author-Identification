				Hey guys, I am just curious on your thoughts about tripping solo, without a sitter. I have plenty of friends who I can get to trip with me, but i&#039;ve always felt that taking a psychadelic alone can be just as fun, if not better than with your friends. Maybe this is because i am more of an introverted person. Whenever I buy shrooms or lsd, I always get enough for me to trip at least twice; once with friends, and once by myself. When you are by yourself, you can feel free to do whatever you want, instead of following the majority when you are with a group. However tripping by yourself has its drawbacks as well. If you have a bad trip, there will be no one there to comfort you or remind you that it&#039;s just the drug. That is why i would reccomend tripping by yourself only if you are an experienced psychonaut (which i am). Also, you will have no one to compare the experience with. I think a lot of the fun of tripping with a group, is describing to each other what you are seeing/feeling. Despite all this, i still enjoy exploring my own thoughts in my room at night on a psychadelic. It is very introspective. In fact, I just received one of USAShroomz galindoi chocolate bars in the mail today and am looking forward to taking the plunge when I get out of work tonite. W00t!

				It really depends on the person. Some prefer solo trips, some prefer tripping with others. Set and setting is key to everyone.<br /><br />Personally I like to trip with my girlfriend. It&#039;s hard to have a bad trip when you&#039;re getting head..:)

				I always trip by myself. I disagree that you have to be experienced with the drug in order to do it solo. You don&#039;t have to be experienced, you just have to be well researched. KNOW what this drug will do to you and the effects it will have on your body and mind and you will be perfectly fine. Just don&#039;t take an insane amount your first time.<br /><br />But yeah I trip alone for a number of reasons, the main one being that my friends don&#039;t agree with drugs, which is perfectly fine. Because I find solo trips amazing! It&#039;s just this self exploration, kid like, creative experience that I love. I feel like if I ever tripped with people, most likely they would inhibit me from actually doing what I want to do. Solo trips are amazing.

				I enjoy tripping alone but start small. No matter how much research you do, it still doesn&#039;t fully prepare you for the experience. I made this mistake the first time I did LSD. I was not prepared though I had thought I was. <br /><br />Remember set and setting, don&#039;t take too much the first time and give it a shot. Solo trips can be quite informationative and transformative.

				yeah one time I ate two 300 microgram hits of L&nbsp; by myself because i didn&#039;t really know how much 300 mics was. It was a mind blowing experience, although it was pretty frightening, because i saw things i never thought you could see on acid. Now that I know what its like to take an extremely high dose of LSD, i feel like I could do it again and be fine

				For me it depends what psychedelic substance i`ll be using, dose, experience with particular substance etc... But generally i don`t really like to trip with other people. I don`t use em for recreational purposes. For me its a deep, spiritual or whatever you can call it , introspective experience and i prefer to be in selfness to explore my inner space.&nbsp; :)

				I dunno.&nbsp; I really enjoy both varieties of trips.&nbsp; They each have a place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly though, I think it&#039;s a really good idea if you&#039;re tripping alone to have some xanax on hand.&nbsp; It&#039;s really reassuring just to have it and know it&#039;ll pull you out of a bad trip.

				I definitely agree with weirdal.&nbsp; If you go into a trip worried it&#039;s easy to let your imagination get the best of you.&nbsp; Just the thought of having some benzos like xanax can make it so much more relaxed and enjoyable.&nbsp; It&#039;s a total diff experience trippin alone or out with friends, etc..&nbsp; I prefer to do some hardcore trips when I&quot;m solo so I can chill and zone out without trying to maintain social skills and so on, esp with stronger psychedelics..

				Camping out in nature is mind blowing, especially on a warm day when the sun hits you and feel the warmth crawling on you, its like the suns fingers touch you. Setting is key to any hard trip, we have been conditioned to think in certain ways, these things enables us to throw that away and open our mind up to whole new ideas and perspectives.

I tend to get a bit antsy tripping with other people, worrying if the other person is enjoying themselves, if I seem stupid to the other people, etc. I think maybe getting to grips with tripping by myself will lessen the paranoia.

				Anyo: I don&#039;t think it works like that, Benzo&#039;s are used to treat anxiety.&nbsp; They&#039;re literally a chill pill and will pull you out of a bad trip.&nbsp; <br /><br />Syme: If you&#039;re not sure you&#039;ll do alright tripping by yourself it&#039;d be a good idea to have some xanax with you too.

				&nbsp;I agree with AcrylicArt if your in a good state of mind tripping by yourself is ok. I don&#039;t eat L anymore but when i did I have tripped by myself a couple times. I think it&#039;s better to trip with a trusted friend though because if you eat a little too much you can get pretty deep in your head and it&#039;s cool to have someone to share your experience with anyway. I definetly agree that mirrors are weird when your tripping and very easy to get lost in the old headspace that way :o

				First time tripping, I&#039;d always recommend being with someone. Not because they need to be there to hold your hand, or because there&#039;s a risk you&#039;ll do something stupid, but more because you&#039;re going to be seeing and feeling and thinking about such amazing shit you&#039;re gonna want to blurt it all out and tell someone about it! Keeping it all bottled up inside when you really need to TELL someone about the wonders you&#039;re seeing for the first time isn&#039;t healthy :P<br /><br />Times after that, yeah, tripping alone is fine! Though still better, imho, shared with a few other like minded friends! ;D

				Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have a lot of friends who like to do drugs&nbsp; :( so I usually just trip by myself. At first I was upset that I have really know one to do it with but I&#039;ve learned that you can learn so much about yourself when just tripping alone in a dark room.<br /><br />I guess it depends what you want to get out of the experience. If you are tripping to have a crazy fun time, I would recommend doing it with others. If you are tripping to find some meaning, purpose, guidance - tripping alone really gives that to you because you are thinking about yourself and are very much in your own head.

				Tripping with the right people is cool because it seems like everyone is on the same exact trip.&nbsp; Shit can get funny too.&nbsp; There is that threshold you cross though when the science of the drug on the brain disappears and it gets real spiritual.&nbsp; Some of the shit makes me wonder if its really an hallucination or is that shit really there and the drug just opened our eyes to the spirit world.&nbsp; I got dropped back at my place towards the end of a night of trippin one time and soon as I got in, the kitchen floor was moving and the walls were breathing, thats when I knew I had a ways to go before I came down.

				I trip alone pretty often and I love it for the mental effects. You have more time to think and do things you like to do by yourself. For me, that&#039;s writing music. <br /><br />You *should* first experience it with someone who &quot;knows the ropes&quot;, though. Also, if you have any sort of predisposition towards a psychiatric disorder like depression or psychosis, I wouldn&#039;t recommend tripping alone. I could foresee that ending badly. <br /><br />My paranoia is also more crippling when I&#039;m alone

Redosing is the way to go. By the 1.5-2 hour mark, you will have a good idea where the trip is headed. If you feel you want to go deeper in, take the other half.<br /><br />Benzos are nice to have around, but taking a less heroic initial dose usually keeps things nice.

				When it comes to something like acid or mushrooms, I&#039;d have to say no. <br />A couple years ago I dropped three hits of potent stuff with some old buddies from high school at Pitchfork. We became a single organism and traveled through the music festival like it was an alien planet. Now when I trip without those guys I feel incomplete. I imagine tripping alone would be unpleasant. Although I suppose I&#039;m talking large doses here. I have eaten a couple grams of mushrooms out of boredom once. Still prefer company, but both experiences are valuable. I just can&#039;t imagine going hard without anyone else to ground you in the experience.

				Tripping alone can be really fun if you&#039;re already fairly experienced with psychedelics. It&#039;s definitely a no-no for new users.<br /><br />The trip tends to be more introspective and you&#039;re not limited in what you can do because your friends aren&#039;t into it (e.g. music, watching a trippy movie etc.). Can be very spiritual.

				Tripping solo is awesome, in my opinion. Whenever I trip with others, they often want to do things that I don&#039;t and vise versa, which can really ruin the trip. When you do it alone you are in 100% control, which is perfect when tripping.

				I love me a good solo trip. Nobody to bring you down or scare you into a bad trip because THEY&#039;RE freaking out and making you anxious because of that. Just make sure you have something to keep you busy or it can get a little weird.<br /><br />Solo trips on DMT are my favorite. In fact, in most situations I think having someone trip with you on DMT only makes it more possible for them to ruin the trip. One time, me and a friend sat down and smoked about 35 mg each and as soon as I started tripping I closed my eyes to fully enjoy the visuals and everything was great, but when he saw me do this he was all like &quot;DUDE, don&#039;t close your eyes every time you smoke DMT!&quot; and proceeded to explain why it&#039;s usually better to look at real things when you trip because when you close your eyes you don&#039;t see reality and that&#039;s bad blah blah blah blah. He tried to explain this to me until I was completely sober again. Let&#039;s just say it was potentially the best DMT trip ever but turned to one of my worst experiences because THAT MOTHER FUCKER WOULDN&#039;T SHUT THE FUCK UP!! I DON&#039;T WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE WHEN I&#039;M IN THAT SORT OF HEADSPACE!!! I wanted to punch him in the face SO BAD! And he was and still is one of my best friends.<br /><br />Anyways yea, that&#039;s my rant. A word of advice, if you are with someone tripping on DMT, don&#039;t talk to them unless they talk to you. Verbal communication on such a powerful psychedelic can be too much to handle sometimes.

				I love to be around people. I thrive on it. I love traveling the world and interacting with people from different cultures, living in a state of constant celebration and extroverted learning. And yet, there are some times when I am tripping with friends that it becomes subtly frustrating. What&#039;s the issue? Well, there is a certain good feeling that comes from being around people and just enjoying the moments and experiences with them. But, at times, there arises in me this desire to be productive, pushing the limits of my consciousness, doing things like locking myself in a room with three hits of acid and binural beats on my headphones with a really intense philosophy book in my lap. I&#039;d be more than willing to engage in this kind of productive, intellect increasing exercise with other people, but for the most part...people in groups just want to do childish things like look at cool colors, gawk at trails, and watch movies that are as dry as cracker juice with less depth than a hermaphrodite&#039;s genitals just because visuals are so &quot;trippy&quot;. That has it&#039;s time and its place, and its not bad. But, there are times when I want to actually use the altered state of consciousness advantageously, to accomplish feats of progression that are not normally attainable. And, its unfortunate that it&#039;s hard to get people on that bandwagon. So, its up to me, and in this case...You...to separate yourself for a time, and make it everything that it can be. It used to be the case that you couldn&#039;t do that. Getting the hits meant being able to involve yourself socially. And, being involved socially meant that its not particularly easy to escape your social circle without being rude or looking like an introvert. Now, though, apparently, with the anonymity that SR offers...you can be alone, and also be social (on the forum) and still get the hits. Anyways, you wanted what people think of it, here&#039;s my take: I intend to use what I buy here about 40% alone and 60% sharing in close knit social circles. To me, that seems like a good balance.

				I love tripping solo. But you need to know how to handle your acid.<br /><br />There have been times where it has completely kicked my ass and sent me into a really bad space.<br /><br />The important thing is understanding how to recover from being sent into a bad mindset when you&#039;re alone.<br /><br />Once you reach the point of being able to control the acid as opposed to letting the acid control you - that&#039;s when the real magic happens.

				I think it&#039;s amusing that people here are saying opposite things. :)&nbsp; &#039;Control the acid&#039; &#039;Go with the flow&#039;.&nbsp; Most people say go with the flow, however, I&#039;ve also experienced being comfortable enough with a psychedelic that I can kind of control, or point the direction of a trip.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t ALWAYS go where it&#039;s pointed, but generally it works pretty well.<br /><br />Other people are saying you have to know how to handle yourself.&nbsp; I&#039;m scared of things that have to be determined by myself.&nbsp; As a rule I&#039;m a fuck up and I tend to not make all the best choices.&nbsp; If the outcome of my life were determined solely by myself I would be terrified.&nbsp; I&#039;m confident in knowing that God has a greater plan for me than I could ever imagine.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing His will worked out and it keeps a LOT of worry and therefore bad trips at bay. :)

Haha. That is probably the one thing that freaks me out the most, solo or not!<br /><br />In general, I enjoy a solo shroom trip ocassionally. I find it helpful if I&#039;m feeling &quot;stuck&quot; or in a &quot;funk&quot; in my life. It challenges me to think differently. It&#039;s like a &quot;create your own adventure&quot; experience. If I&#039;m less than content before my trip, I lift myself up during the trip, and as a result I feel a lot better after the trip!

				Tripping alone is very enjoyable if you want to do lots of thinking, I do quite a lot of that and have had no problems at all, once we know how to control our minds (needs some practice), we can avoid having a bad trip. I have never had bad trips in years now and I don&#039;t think I could have any bad trip in the future.<br /><br />Bad thoughts could come, but we know it can&#039;t harm us because it&#039;s not real. But even so, all the scary things we see are just a part of ourselves, they are our fears, hates, regrets, etc. It&#039;s good to be able to see them so clearly, as in our daily life we are numbed. We are taught to cover up our weaknesses, and so, we pretend the dark parts of us don&#039;t exist. From my experiences, shrooming is one of the best ways to learn about myself, and enable me to be a better person.

				Best advice for trippin&#039; solo would be to always keep one hand on reality. If your by yourself, you can&#039;t allow yourself to fall over that edge and loose grip. Whatever happens, always remember; &quot;It&#039;s just a drug. This isn&#039;t real. I will come down eventually.&quot;<br /><br />The likelyhood of interruption should me minimal, as an &quot;intruder&quot; into your trip can be rather unsettling. My hardest trip ever was when I thought it&#039;d be a good idea to take 3.5 grams of good &#039;shrooms after coming home by myself at 5:00am after a hard roll on 5 hits of mediocre X. I&#039;d never done that before... and now I know what CandyFlipping is (didn&#039;t have a name back then). &#039;Shrooms kick that shit right back into gear, and then some!<br />I kept one hand on reality, and even when I lost my vision for 5-10 minutes, I told myself; &quot;It&#039;s just a drug. This isn&#039;t real. I will come down eventually.&quot;<br /><br />...and I did.

				I&#039;ve suffered from social anxiety for most of my life. Have had counseling for it on and off for the past few years and tried treatment such as REMT. <br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever taken acid once, with a group of friends, about 15 years ago and It really turned me inside out. It made me feel really insecure and I just wanted to get away from everyone. Just found it really unpleasant.<br /><br />Since discovering SR, I&#039;ve thought about trying it again, by myself this time, to see if I can get any insights into my condition. A couple of friends have advised me against this, as I would probably just suffer from &quot;horrible introspection&quot; for a few hours. But I think this is what I need. To get in touch with my subconscious maybe?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Is this a bad idea? Any advice would be great.<br /><br />Cheers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Some of us are better off tripping alone in a peaceful environment. :)<br /><br />When you normally get anxious or nervous around others, you are better off tripping alone. Especially on acid you are the pilot of your trip, therefor you should avoid entering the amplified state of fear, a bad trip. The set and setting are very significant.<br /><br />During my first acid trip I was alone, but things worked out well. The trip was amazing :)<br />Though it is a risk you take, because in case of any exception you are off on your own...<br />I am planning to go for a higher dosage the next time, probably 300µg.<br /><br />Just make sure you are in a relaxed state of mind and physically fit and that you are comfortable with your environment. Take care with the dosages, start low and build up slowly, you will be fine. :)
