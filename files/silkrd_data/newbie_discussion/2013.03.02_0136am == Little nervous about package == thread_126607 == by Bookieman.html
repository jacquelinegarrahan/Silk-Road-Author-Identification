				I dont think its a scam because this vendor has been around a while and perfect feedback<br /><br />Im not saying that I wouldnt believe it though<br /><br /><br />More worried about pkg being intercepted than anything

				There&#039;s risk in this game for sure.&nbsp; It is ok to be suspicious of everything as long as you keep a head on your shoulders and don&#039;t react stupidly.&nbsp; 1g probably doesn&#039;t mean much.&nbsp; A search warrant and finding much more can be very bad though.&nbsp; Unlikely for a 1g order?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But it sounds like you&#039;ve done a lot of orders so yours risks go up.<br /><br />USPS doesn&#039;t always make their express mail deadlines though.&nbsp; Very easy for a vendor to miss the drop deadline as well.

				Possible if it did get intercepted even on a small order they could try to get you to sign or leave a slip saying to pick it up at the PO. More than likely PO fucked up and sent it to the wrong PO and it needs to be resent, Had this happen on a priority order with a good molly vendor just took an extra 2 days. Wait a week and if nothing happens at all either address mistake or vendor selectively scammed you, or is lazy

				I&#039;ve never had it take more than 2 days for an express and that was only usually involving weekend. The post office doesn&#039;t usually just confiscate things. They ask you to come pick it up and sign for it and things. More than likely he didn&#039;t ship it when he claimed he did or something came up and delayed him a day or two. You&#039;ll either get it soon or he&#039;ll respond with an apology. Of course he could have never sent it at all and something could have happened but there is nothing you can do about that on his end. The escrow system works in your favor in that regard even if its a bit slow.
