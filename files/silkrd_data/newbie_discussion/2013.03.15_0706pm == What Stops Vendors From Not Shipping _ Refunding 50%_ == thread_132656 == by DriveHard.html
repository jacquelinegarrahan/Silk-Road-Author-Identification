				What stops a vendor from accepting an order, claiming it was shipped (even though it wasn&#039;t) and then refunding 50%? Top vendors seem to be able to easily selectively scam because a single 1/5 review won&#039;t hurt them. And a refund can hurt a buyer&#039;s stats, making them more susceptible to getting scammed in the future because they would be more willing to eat a failed transaction to avoid worsening stats.<br /><br />Even if you don&#039;t FE, you can still end up losing! Are there any bulletproof vendors?

				What stops a dealer from robbing you IRL?<br />This is a anonymous marketplace, everything is based on trust. If you don&#039; t trust the vendor, don&#039;t give him your money, but nothing stops him from using this method of scamming if they want to.

				If buyers keep up this &quot;when in doubt, blame the vendors!&quot; mentality, there WILL be no more fucking sellers for buyers to buy from in the first place.<br /><br />Have you ever stopped to think that maybe YOU fucked up? Vendors -- especially top vendors -- have way more people to vouch for their credibility than buyers do,&nbsp; which isn&#039;t of course the buyers fault, but still helps further prove the vendors credibility. I&#039;ve been a seller on SR consistently for about a year &amp; a half, &amp; although there&#039;s NEVER been ONE order that I marked as shipped but didn&#039;t ship, COUNTLESS numbers of people have not received their package from me. Buyers have treated me like shit, constantly blamed me &amp; insisted on full refunds... Vendors end up having to pay for USPS&#039;s fuck ups in order to keep their stats up.<br /><br />After a certain point, I stopped selling on SR the stuff that people liked best from me (incredibly cheap, high-quality pills) because I realized it was SO much easier to, when possible, sell to people in real life than on SR. <br /><br />
