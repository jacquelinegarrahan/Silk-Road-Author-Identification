				As you may have read, Atlantis shut down overnight, with &quot;Vladimir&quot; and &quot;Loera&quot; having disappeared, along with the emptying of all wallets on the site. As late as Thursday, they claimed that their failing site would overtake SR &quot;within a year&quot;.<br /><br />Clearnet link:<br /><br />http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/2013/08/shopping-for-drugs-on-the-internet/<br /><br />&quot;One such site has been the Silk Road which earns millions in its sale of illegal drugs.&nbsp; In fact it has become so successful that other start-ups are trying to compete for customers by setting up their own sites for selling drugs and other illegal items in a cyber turf-war. One such start-up, Atlantis, has reported 500 sign-ups per day and has 50,000 registered users and expects to over-take the Silk Road within a year.&quot;

				Really? Any evidence for this? I hope you&#039;re wrong, as I have 0.9 BTC there.<br /><br />If you are sure they&#039;re scamming, and not coming back, stick a bet on here with any spare BTC (clearnet) http://betsofbitco.in/item?id=1343<br /><br />&quot;The TOR litecoin shop called Atlantis will disappear before Dec 31, 2013<br />The bet is that the site will go permanently offline for any reason before that date.&quot;<br />

				Nobody is gone anywhere :)<br /><br />Site is down for brief maintenance period and this is just a terrible attempt by the OP to spread uncertainty and doubt.<br />If somebody even wanted to do a runner would it not be easier to leave the site online and keep the scam running.<br /><br />Oh wait...That would make sense :P
