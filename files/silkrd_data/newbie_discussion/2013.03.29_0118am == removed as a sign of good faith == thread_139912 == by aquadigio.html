				WTF? That&#039;s disgusting! More details please.<br />Honestly dude, in this situation, I would make the sick motherfucker regret it his whole life. I would say a combination of plastering every single bit of his information (picture, phone, address, email, social media) allover every single Anti Pedophilia Forum you could find. Anonymous tips to his local police, FBI, DEA (because he&#039;s probably also used the USPS to purchase drugs if he&#039;s on Silk Road.. and normally I wouldn&#039;t condone anyone getting trouble for Silk Road related drug activity but this would clearly be an exception to that rule), tell his co worrkers (since you said &quot;Good Guy&quot; found out everything about him), his family members, his kids, his wife, his parents, his neighbors, his facebook friends. Once that information gets online, that motherfuckers world will crumble. No sympathy for pedos. Care to share any more details about this fucker? Or hypothetical details?

In fact it will an extremely vague hypothetical out of respect to the mods and admins who have a hard time as it is keep this place sane.. let alone get into battles over who has the right to censor/views on CP loving animals right to privacy.<br /><br />Lets say PERSON A (we&#039;ll call him Good Guy) is minding their own business on the forum one day and get a PM from PERSON B (we&#039;ll call him Bad Guy) to the effect of &quot;hey, sorry about that. so yeah, you know where I can find that CP?&quot;<br />Good Guy thinks &quot;what the fuck?&quot; but knowing this is the deepweb and theres always scams and weirdos ignores it. Bad Guy then messages Good Guy again with &quot;well just text me when you get this&quot;.<br /><br />Good Guy ponders this for a minute. And then comes to the conclusion Bad Guy mistook Good Guys username for someone he must know/was having a discussion with regarding the version serious and sick matter of CP. Normally, Good Guy would not give a fuck to get involved in anyone elses life, but this struck a chord. So Good Guy responds with &quot;dude, I deleted your #. What&#039;s it again? I&#039;ll text you right now&quot;. Bad Guy, being the idiot that most perverts are, responds with his text. Good Guy then tells Bad Guy &quot;Fuck you freak. Drugs are cool. CP IS NOT COOL motherfucker and I hope one day someone punishes you&quot;. To which Bad Guy responds with a few curse words, then says it was a joke, and then deletes his account.<br /><br />Now, Good Guy, utilizing Google pops Bad Guys number into the search box and finds out his real information. All of it. <br /><br />In this hypothetical, what would YOU DO if YOU were The Good Guy? What options are there? Plaster this animals information allover forums that were designed to &quot;out&quot; child molesters? (NOT THIS FORUM)? Anonymously hand over that information to the cops in BAD GUYSs state and let them take a peek at this TOR activities? Forget about it? Email Bad Guy through TOR and demand he never touch CP again (not that there&#039;d be any way to trust/verify the promises of a sick fuck).?<br /><br />What would YOU do if you were the Good Guy. And please no silly answers like &quot;cut his nuts off&quot;, because the last time I checked, the nature of TOR makes it quite hard to have any access to anyones nuts.<br /><br />Ok class, GO!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Suggest you hand your info over to a Moderator at Perverted Justice and let them take it from there - if they do decide to reveal the man&#039;s number and personal info it will be more likely to be taken seriously then.<br /><br />V.

People just harras him for the rest of his life?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was a member back in the day - the response very much depends on the information they have managed to glean. In US states where it is a crime to try to solicit a minor for sex regardless of whether the person to whom you&#039;re speaking is one or not, then the authorities can be notified if a PJ member impersonates a child online and is approached by one of these scumbags.<br /><br />Volunteers for PJ spend time frequenting chatrooms and social networking sites posing as children - there are times when all they might have is a person&#039;s photo and a user ID or even just the latter, in which case they have a hall of shame.<br /><br />They also helped Dateline NBC do an extremely entertaining and effective series called &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot; (it&#039;s on Youtube), wherein their volunteers posed as precocious young teens online and when contacted by perverts, they&#039;d lure them to a specially rigged house complete with cameras and microphones. They would also make use of a youthful young adult actor to invite the paedophile into the house, only for them to have a very awkward conversation with Chris Hansen. It is highly entertaining to watch them squirm and they were arrested afterward.<br /><br />Consider that PJ have trained investigators who might be able to glean more information than just the person&#039;s name and phone number, such as the kind of sites they frequent. In order to nail this bastard properly, the Police will need to establish who he has been contacting online - a copy of a request for CP simply won&#039;t cut it legally. If you do it this way, they can wait in the background until this guy actually does incriminate himself and then (and only then!) move in and bury him with a mountain of evidence.<br /><br />Food for thought I hope .<br /><br />V.

I&#039;m sure he&#039;s grabbing his ankles right now..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes I saw that! Shocking stuff!<br /><br />The worrying thing I found when I started speaking to volunteers at PJ and watching To Catch a Predator was firstly how diverse a background these men came from- young and old, literate and illiterate, there was a Rabbi, a couple of teachers, a decorated Secret Service agent and so on as well as truck drivers, unemployed people and people working joe jobs - almost all of them were Caucasian which interested me, although perhaps this says more about the demographic of internet users than it does about paedophiles.<br /><br />Secondly I think we really do underestimate the scale on which this is taking place. After they did series 3, Hansen himself said (and I agree!) that you could set up one of these trap houses anywhere in the US and people would still show up by the dozen. Some men even went into the house after seeing others arrested outside - there need to abuse children seems to have been so great.<br /><br />But of course we can all agree how upset we are by child abuse - the question is how we respond to it on a practical level. The sort of thing you did is a step in the right direction -&nbsp; rather than acting in outrage you pretended to play online. I also think the Police in each county need a full time unit of civilian investigators impersonating minors online so we can trap potential abusers. <br /><br />We tell children always to be careful to whom we&#039;re speaking online, as their new &quot;friend&quot; may not be all they say they are. No doubt any predators they catch will appreciate the irony. :-)<br /><br />V.

				Some of the TCAP arrests were not able to stick.&nbsp; After a dude in Texas shot himself before they arrested him, all the cases were thrown out because the judge said the PD depended too much on the newscast for their evidence.&nbsp; Something fucked up like that, I can&#039;t remember all the details, but I rmember hearing about it and thinking it was fucked.&nbsp; Those dudes still had their faces on TV though, so I&#039;m fairly sure they aren&#039;t enjoying the most free of lives anymore.&nbsp; But they aren&#039;t rotting in a hole getting slammed by their cellmate either.

				Fuck calling the cops. Nothing good will ever come from dealing with those assholes. I&#039;d just post him up all over the internet so that anyone that google&#039;s his name/city would know that he is a sick pedophile. After being friendly with him and getting as much info as possible. Then I would provide this info to the public via internet using various SEO techniques to make sure that his reputation is ruined. <br /><br />Fucked up thing? Pedophiles typically get less time then drug dealers? What kind of fucked up society do we live in? How does LE feel good about themselves at the end of the day chasing drug offenders when there are much more dangerous people out there.
