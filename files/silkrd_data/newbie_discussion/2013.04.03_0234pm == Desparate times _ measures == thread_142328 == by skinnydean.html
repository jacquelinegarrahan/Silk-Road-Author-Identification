				Am still a neewbie so cannot post in the main forums.<br /><br />An order I placed has not arrived today as expected, should be here tomorrow, but in the meantime I have run out of vallium and am struggling badly. Is there anyone in the Nottingham area UK who could meet me - I literally need 10 blues, or 5 would do or even 2!!! I&#039;ll pay Â£1.00 a tablet if that sounds about right? Can anyone meet me? let me know and I will phone to arrange.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Skinny Dean.

				No. Nobody&#039;s going to be stupid enough to do that, don&#039;t be silly.<br />A night off the benzo&#039;s may do you some good.

				I&#039;m on my third night off and am struggling cos I have a bit of a habit (80mg / day) so the level in my system is now about 1/4 of what it is used to and the effects are getting very noticable to people. I&#039;m very tempted to have a few beers, which will remedy the situation, but being a recovering alcoholic,that is to big a risk for me to consider taking. Like I say desparate times and I&#039;m only looking for a tiny deal, I&#039;m not a twat, I am a late 20&#039;s man, cyclist type and I am straight up as people come. I fucking hate scoring on the streets, SR has saved me so much bother, but a badly planned BH weekend situation has left me short. Can anyone help me please?

No point in telling us how sad your story is - the sadder it is the more likely it&#039;s bait. Plus, this is a worldwide community - hands up everyone whole lives in Nottingham, UK.... [tumbleweed]....<br /><br />I suggest you go hang-out with some junkies and see if they know any locals you can score a hit from, it is by far and a long way your best bet. Try any pharmacies that issue methadone or summink...

				or contact NHS direct (or whatever&nbsp; its new name is) and talk to a nurse and see if there&#039;s anything they can suggest. fwiw, unless it has changed, any info you give them isn&#039;t sent to the medical record that your doctor has, so it shouldn&#039;t get back to them unless you need to go to the surgery. ask first if you&#039;re wary.

				really shouldn&#039;t give out too much of your own info like that, if you are legit. <br />have any friends that get panic attacks and possibly have a script of some benzos? even ambien will help.<br />it sounds like you&#039;re just trading one addiction for another though, brother<br />valium can have some rough withdrawals and you said it yourself you&#039;re upping your dose. quit while youre ahead man i&#039;ve seen some close friends lose it to xanax and other benzos

				I was in pretty much the same situation recently with long acting opiates and waiting while in WD.<br /><br />I really feel bad for you cause I know benzo WD is so much crazier than opiate WD, but yeah.... no one here is really going to be able to help you. If anyone in my area was ever in opiate WD I&#039;d be tempted to go drop a care package in a random location and PM them the location later, cause WD is such an evil fuckin beast, but I doubt that is gonna happen for you either. Maybe it would be better just to ask that though, maybe a kind soul would help you out. I would if I had what you needed and was in UK, but neither of those apply.<br /><br />Anyways, hang in there man. I hope your stuff arrives tomorrow.

				Hey Mate<br /><br />Sympathy and prayers but your better off going to a pub, not one were you and your crew watch football, but one a bit further from yours were you won&#039;t be recognized. Sit down and order a pint and strike up a conversation with the bar man.&nbsp; Assess if he&#039;s your guy and ask. Worst case scenario the pint might help.<br />

				Why not just go to a doctor and get a script, say your suffering from meth withdrawl and need something to take the edge of it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done that in the past.

				If you have this much of a problem, you should go see your doctor. Everything you tell them is in confidence, and they can help you more than anyone here can.

				Mate, talk to a doctor, what you&#039;re experiencing is a serious medical issue that will not be ignored.<br />You have the NHS in UK and they WILL sort you out. As previously said , any doctor that turns you away should be struck off as this would be serious neglect. Nevermind scoring valium from junkies.<br />Perhaps you have parents or aunts or uncles who may have a few knocking about the house? Loads of straight people have a few valium knocking about the place these days.<br /><br />I hope you&#039;re ok and get through it safely, and you should see a doctor about your addiction also, you really don&#039;t want to be on 80mg a day for much longer. Look after yourself.<br /><br />
