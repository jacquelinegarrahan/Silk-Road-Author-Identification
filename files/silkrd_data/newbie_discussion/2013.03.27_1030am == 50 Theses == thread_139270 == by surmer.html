				1. U.S. Navy developed TOR.<br /><br />Exit nodes allow data capture. If you&#039;re smart, you&#039;ll choose your exit node, instead of random assignment. Even though things are &quot;encrypted&quot;, you are still logging in through an ISP. Tor is a randomized, encrypted internet protocol. Read #1 again.

				3. Cybersecurity and National Security<br /><br />LE is here. It&#039;s a fucking headache, because we don&#039;t know how present they really are. Vendors? Sure. Buyers? Sure. What else is there? Oh yeah, terrorism. Evil motherfuckers that wanna poison you. It hasn&#039;t happened yet, but since it&#039;s possible, it&#039;s a statistical inevitability.<br /><br />Until the State legalizes drugs and starts funding Public Health instead of bailouts and other bullshit, we have to test ourselves. I can&#039;t tell you what&#039;s safe: only a chemical test can--which means you need to learn some chemistry. You&#039;re more than a customer, you&#039;re a citizen, a friend, a child, and maybe even a parent. This is serious shit. Life is serious shit.<br /><br />LE or not, we have a responsibility to take care of ourselves. We now have a responsibility to the forums for sharing what information we have--and then verifying that information. Everything here is DOUBLESPEAK. It is both true and false. I am both LE and not LE. Get your heads in the game. This is about patriotism, freedom, safety, security--not just getting fucked up!

The forum is OK, but remember the DOUBLESPEAK. If you haven&#039;t read 1984 in a while, it&#039;s time to sit down and refresh yourself. Sober up a little. If you&#039;re on the forums while you&#039;re intoxicated, then you should get ready for prison.<br /><br />DEA and FBI will push you into a corner. Life in prison, or help bust a seller. This is how they make their living, through extortion. Take your lumps. It&#039;s better that way, because when you do get picked up for some petty charge, and put away, the truth will find you.

But... but... won&#039;t that take decades or even a century to compute?<br /><br />Um... you need to head over to MIT OpenCourseWare, do some reading. Get the story behind computing power, laws of physics. Cryptography is about finding the hard problems to solve--and then SOLVING THEM. Refer back to my first thesis.

So, if I want, all I need to do is steal your hashes, transfer your bitcoins, and I&#039;m done. ALL TRANSFERS ARE FINAL. No refunds. Once your money is stolen, it&#039;s MINE FOREVER.

Now it threatens South Korea.<br /><br />Get ready for your heroin supply to get disrupted? Ha ha, just kidding. It will fucking BOOM! Just like organized crime used Vietnam to fly that shit home.

By hiding in plain sight. Have you done your homework on TOR? Bitcoin? Open Source. MIT students have already managed to usurp data from this honeypot. You are NOT anonymous.<br /><br />ANONYMOUS exists because most of the human population is mentally castrated. The population largely follows the Bell Curve, Gaussian distribution of intelligence.

You are a terrorist, a threat to national security and public health.<br /><br />More importantly, how will WE know if you are busted? Those vendors that up-and-run... were they thieves in the end, or were they hacked? Were they molested by MiB? Do you have a plan to notify the Community?

				24. Synergy<br /><br />ANONYMOUS is successful in stopping DarkNet CP because they say they are. Posting John Doe&#039;s information is not protecting--or stopping--anyone. ANONYMOUS is SYNONYMOUS with fraud, extortion, piracy, hacking, and deception. How do you create such an ominous entity? Mostly fiction, but when there&#039;s undeniable evidence, then one needs to consider the sources. <br /><br />Military Precision/Organized Crime. Both compete with each other, but the mastermind realizes that contracting to military and government entities not only offers financial security to the contractor, but enables the contractor (criminal network) to operate legally and in the clear. The U.S. of A. runs the largest criminal network in the world, aside from China. Our intelligence communities: CIA (independent), Defense Intelligence Agency (DoD), National Security Agency (DoD), Army/Navy/Air Force/Marine Intelligence (DoD), are responsible for securing and supplying our executive branch with intelligence and material to secure resources. Becoming involved in national security and cybersecurity contributes to political, social, and financial security.

				29. The Dope Game<br /><br />It&#039;s no different than any other human institution: economics, education, politics. It is, however, the perfect teaching tool to understand how human society has--and at present--worked. People lie. Governments lie. Natural cycles follow these basic laws of thermodynamics.<br /><br />Chaos in nature. Nature in chaos. Lie. Cheat. Steal. Kill.<br /><br />Thou Shall.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t protect against evil, then evil will win.<br /><br />WTF? What am I going on about?<br /><br />Fuck are you going on about?<br /><br />I&#039;ll tell you what I&#039;m going on about. In order to protect from evil, one must understand evil. As your mind dives into the depths of despair and suffering, your mind (and DNA) is altered. The cascade of changes proliferates into your physical hardware--wetware--and fundamental alterations to your consciousness and subconscious take place. Entering TOR and the SR is only the beginning of this depravity.

How many millions go to the Jews to kill Arabs? Iran wants to nuke us because of that.
