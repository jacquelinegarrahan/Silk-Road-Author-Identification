				I ordered a batch of generic medication (non-scheduled prescriptions) from overseas. Not the first time I&#039;ve done this, I usually order generics as backup meds in case my doctor isn&#039;t available. Last week, as I was coming into my apartment, there was a postal Supervisor standing in front of my door with my package, a pink slip for pickups, and one of those portable scanning machines. I walked up to him and the only thing he asked me as was &quot;Do I live here?&quot;, I told him yeah and he says he has a package for me. I looked @ the package, and OMG, the packaging SUCKED. Like, you could see/feel the pills sticking out the paper packaging, the shipper wrote the wrong city on the package, plus there was no return address, just a stamp from customs from the originating country. The postal supervisor and I kinda just looked @ the package and at each other for about 15 seconds, and then I signed for it, took the package, and he left.<br /><br />Should I be worried about anything? I&#039;ve ordered stuff off SR before but this is the first time a Supervisor personally hand-delivered a package to me, which I find very unsettling. Thank God I had nothing shady in there. The package is sitting in my house, unopened, and I wrote return to sender on it like 15 times (Not happy with this seller right now).<br /><br />

				Um, prescriptions *are* scheduled; that&#039;s what makes them &quot;presecriptions.&quot;<br /><br />If they really are unscheduled as you seem to think, then why are you worried?

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it though, unless you have a grow-op in your basement. People get small things like electronics shipped in envelopes all the time.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be happy with the vendor either.

				&quot;nothing shady&quot;? ..I&#039;m not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. Prescription medications whether generic or branded, are issued by pharmacists and doctors. Getting them anywhere else is illegal, hence why you had to buy them on SR instead of the supermarket. <br />Or am I missing something here?&nbsp; (ÅŒ_o) <br /><br />If it were me, I&#039;d have told the delivery guy that it was nothing to do with me and to take them back.

				The guy had a nametag that said in bigass letters: SUPERVISOR, on it, with the USPS logo, and USPS clothes on and was delivering mail like a normal mailman? I didn&#039;t sense any authoritarian/cop vibes from him, he seemed more concerned about the lack of a return address so that&#039;s why I kinda just rolled with it and signed for it. As far as the meds go, there were some meds in there for bipolar, testosterone boosters, and some loose pieces of viagra. I have legit scripts for all this stuff, these are my backups, but I guess it could technically be considered trafficking. F the police man, I&#039;m just trying to make sure I stay mentally/physically healthy at all times to take care of my mom when she needs me.&nbsp; Based on the response I&#039;ve gotten, I&#039;m being kinda lax. My lease ends this month, gonna move to a new city and chillax for a few months before hoppin&#039; on the road again.

				I get stuff from the supervisor at the PO all the time - but never had him deliver something to my house. I don&#039;t think that supervisor is a very high position. I think that they are basically a manager, and so they have to fill in for sick employees fairly often. He was probably just covering for a delivery postman who was out that day. I wouldn&#039;t worry - had it been some kind of sting, I think that there would have been an LE waiting in the bushes for you to sign for it or something. Since you already have the package, can&#039;t you just open it and take the pills somewhere safe, and destroy the packaging? Seems like that would take care of any evidence.

				His Name&#039;s koptevo and he&#039;s based out of India. Most of the stuff he sells is generic meds, maybe even fakes (not getting the same effects from these meds compared to the stuff I pick up @ my local pharmacy). I hope this serves as an example to current &amp; future vendors how not to run a business, and as an educational reference to buyers as well.

Did he show ID or introduce himself as the postal supervisor. I&#039;m not sure what that would mean. The supervisor at you&#039;re local post office is your Postmaster. The people that you should be worried and are Postal Inspectors/LE.<br /><br />2. I&#039;m sure the packaged sucked, but I&#039;m sure that he didn&#039;t know what was inside. I think the series of events would be entirely different had you something to worry about. Even if he knew they were pills, I doubt he thought it was a big ol&#039; box o&#039; narcotics.<br /><br />3. It made it through Customs of both the US and Pakistan or India (I&#039;m assuming - they&#039;re usually where the larger quantities ship from). That it cleared US customs alone in a very good sign. They have no idea that you bought that on SR unless the feds have been spying on you, so I doubt that they would let it go through. You&#039;re more likely to get a letter from customs indication a seizure.<br /><br />If it makes you feel any better, I&#039;ve had domestic express mail packages delivered by a different carrier. It doesn&#039;t always happen, but sometimes it does.

Anyone with common sense and working nerves in their hands would have known there were pills in there. People are not stupid. For all I know, I could be flagged right now and future packages more scrutinized if I ever ordered again. Had there been, say, narcotics, benzos, or other goodies in there, I know damn well I&#039;d be fucked right now and wouldn&#039;t be here typing this.

They usually leave a pink or green slip and ask the customer to pick it up at the post office. This change in procedure was what I find odd and unsettling<br /><br />And like I said earlier, I have scripts for all this stuff. I&#039;m only allowed to see my doctor once a month if I&#039;m lucky (I&#039;m one of hundreds of his patients and don&#039;t have the luxury of getting another doc). So, I do what I have to do to stay mentally stable and physically healthy, which means having a stash of meds so I don&#039;t go around roundhousing Microwaves out of third-story windows and being a menace to society in general. Yeah, without meds, I&#039;m hell in a pair of steel-toe combat boots and pretty hard to calm down. You would not believe the things I&#039;ve done to people or the stunts I pull when I&#039;m on loose cannon mode, but I&#039;m not here to talk about that. If it makes you feel better, then go ahead and pretend I ordered crack cocaine, a lighter, and spoon. Whatever dude. Believe what you want to believe man.<br /><br />My intent from the get-go was to see where I was messing up security wise and I thank everyone for the good tips on how to improve for the next time I order. Also, fuck that seller. We, as buyers, jump through all kinds of hoops just to place an order. It&#039;s not unreasonable for me to expect the same level of professionalism from sellers on here. I hope this guy serves as an example of how NOT to ship things to your buyers. Buy from that dude at your own risk. I&#039;m staying domestic only from now on.

				I would definitely be concerned.&nbsp; This has all the hallmarks of a controlled delivery. I probably wouldn&#039;t have signed for the package and just written it off as a loss.&nbsp; That being said, if anything was going to happen it probably would have by now.&nbsp; I still wouldn&#039;t order anything sketchy to that address for a good while if I was you.

				Today I was expecting an a college textbook that i ordered online in the mail. The doorbell rang and it was the mailman who was definitely not my usual mailman standing there, and his nametag had the word &quot;supervisor&quot; under his name. I asked him where my usual mailman was, and he replied that he was out sick so he was covering him instead. I said ok and he handed me my package and left. <br />Moral of the story: Its always advisable to be cautious when ordering drugs in the mail especially when a supervisor comes and asks you to sign, however not every supervisor is there to make busts and more often than not they are just trying to make sure all the mail is delivered and their deadlines are met

It matters. There&#039;s no &quot;supervisor&quot; at your local post office. He&#039;s the Postmaster. That might worry me. And my maillady doesn&#039;t wear a nametag.<br /><br />I do think you&#039;re making way too many excuses for yourself and are going out of your way explaining things about yourself that don&#039;t need to be explained. For that alone, I won&#039;t touch that part. Your paragraph shouldn&#039;t say any more then it does as I&#039;ve edited it. And you don&#039;t even need to say that much.<br /><br />No one really cares what you bought. Even if it was simply penicillin, you still broke all 3 laws that I mentioned. Nothing that you&#039;ve said changes that. I didn&#039;t say it in judgment; I meant it as a precaution and a reality-check. That&#039;s it.<br /><br />USPS hand delivers packages daily. They only leave slips when there&#039;s either no secure location or a signature is required. If I answered my door more, it would happen often. They leave packages that don&#039;t fit in the box at my front door if I don&#039;t answer. So they do (at least in some places --- please don&#039;t get more specific) happen.<br /><br />I agree with you about the seller and also about staying domestic. That&#039;s the only other thing that I said about the purchase: that buying from India or Pakistan (and that was just a guess) was risky, especially large quantities (which is where many ship from).<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m willing to jump through hoops as a buyer is because we&#039;re basically being fronted drugs by strangers with trust, something that wouldn&#039;t occur anywhere else. Sure we take risks too, but the norm for buying drugs from strangers is cash up front -- many times with out the chance to sample before payment.<br /><br />But I do agree with you about professionalism in this case.<br /><br />None of that was meant personally. But if you&#039;re worried about all of that, then stop giving out additional information in an open online forum. That&#039;s all I&#039;m saying.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d be very concerned.&nbsp; You&#039;re probably ok if it was just generic Viagra or innocent stuff like that.&nbsp; Its still technically illegal, but with senior citizens buying cheap drugs from Canada or whatever, they&#039;re probably not going to have a witch hunt to get you.&nbsp; But definitely be more careful next time and you might want to drop that vendor.
