				I have only received 2 orders so far but they have both blown anything I have had in past out of the water. I took a gamble in my book by paying a bit more bit that little bit more is worth it on those 2 orders. I will only been doing it once a month and for small personal amounts class A coke and MDMA but wow so worth it. I can not wait until next month.<br /><br />I have read a lot and have started out using suppliers in the same country as myself but I am tempted on my next order to try a little from abroad.<br /><br />Have fun<br /><br />Mr. Cc<br />

				Silk Road has been very good to me and the people I know who use it.&nbsp; Its best when first trying a new vendor to start out in small quantitys like you mentioned.&nbsp; And once you find one you like order more.&nbsp; Or read the forums to try to find the best consensus on who has the best drug your looking for.&nbsp; Thats how you can find quality vendors who wont scam you.&nbsp; Also communication is key and you can generally tell a good vendor from a poor one based on how soon/well they communicate to you about your order.

				SR has been absolutely great for me, I haven&#039;t had a serious issue in 15 plus orders.<br /><br />I do get nervous about cross-border shipping still, just because of customs and dogs etc. But I have done it several times for XTC in small amounts and no issues at all. Will depend on your country and the product (hard to imagine weed can be 100% smell-proof), but check on the forums for experiences that might match yours.<br /><br />Take care and good luck!

				Yes at first I would stick to domestic just like what the poster above said because customs can be tricky and you may not end up getting your package.&nbsp; Also read the forums for good vendors if your looking for weed.&nbsp; Also check out CannaConnection in the coming weeks as a new vendor. We are offering quality weed grown in California and shipped to you.&nbsp; Along with dispensary quality edibles such as lollipops, jolly ranchers, brownies, bho or bee honey oil and extremely good yayo with your choice from 3 countries.&nbsp; So keep a look out for CannaConnection.&nbsp;

				SR rocks, No problems over 60 transacs, international orders worth few hundreds, and couple thousand dollar weed orders domestic. Postal smuggling = drug wars over ;) FUCK DEA, wasting their time worrying about SR, which reminds me there are vendors popping up that have been around for only a couple days and having 40 some feedback already. One guy i went through his feedback and every single fucking one was completely grammaticily correct with correct punctuation and everything. Also all the feedback was very generic, each with two parts usually along the lines of &quot;Great stuff, awesome vendor&quot; just cycling different words through. I am 99 percent sure vendors like these are L.E. Keep your eyes open people, be healthily paranoid, and use your common sense (which hopefully you still have)

				From a harm reduction point of view, I think SR is an amazing place. It&#039;s tragic it&#039;s not more available to addicts, as it could substantially help reduce disease, etc. Although that would bring it even more attention and thus, the end.<br /><br />From an addict&#039;s point of view, it&#039;s love/hate. I love I can choose what I get and look at reviews, not just walk into some guy&#039;s house and pay for what he has and not know what I&#039;m getting until I get high or die. I hate that it exists because it feeds the habit for not only drugs of preference, but entices the user to try things they never would&#039;ve otherwise been able to acquire. Some of these drugs I didn&#039;t know even existed and I certainly would&#039;ve never encountered them where I live.<br /><br />The effect of SR on your health could be debated all week.

				Silk Road has been GREAT for me. The fact that the concept actually works is a miracle within itself. Second, it has created a second community for me to get to know and socialize with. Being introverted, that within itself is a miracle. DPR has become one of my top heros. Thank you very much.

				SR has changed my life in a very profound way.<br /><br />Because of the road, I was finally able to completely cut off my psychopathic drug dealer and his twisted fuckery.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do not look like a drug user and other dealers I met were always reluctant to work with me as they all thought I was a narc or would easily squeal if caught by the authorities.&nbsp; <br /><br />SR makes my life so much less complicated.&nbsp;

				Before SR existed, I never thought I&#039;d be able to witness an actual free market in operation.<br /><br />As the burdens of taxation, regulation, and currency debasement continue to grow, perhaps this site will serve as a role model for a new economy that returns economic power to producers and consumers, leaving the parasites with nothing to grab onto.<br /><br />It may have consequences that echo far beyond the world of drugs.&nbsp; Time will tell.

				For me Silk Road is a great project. I never thought that something like this is possible!<br />I live in Germany and i use opioid prespription pain killers (Tilidin) for almost 1,5 years now. I always wanted to try out stronger opiat medication (no heroin), but i didnt know any dealers and my friends dont like drugs eccept alkohol and cigarettes. I didnt ask my doctor to prescribe me stronger opiates... i was frightend that he maybe won&#039;t continue prescribing me the lower ones.<br /><br />I researches the internet and found a lot of scam sites, but then i found SR!<br />I bought oxys, morphin &amp; MDMA a few times and it always worked well.<br /><br />SR is really great!

				well, statements like most here dont say very much !<br />because you do not tell what drug your experience here is about !<br /><br />i believe that you can make good experience with weed and also that chem stuff like mdma etc.<br />maybe also with pills, as long as they are original.<br /><br />my experience so far with cocaine (i only do this) is not very good.<br />i am here only ~ 4 month and have ~ 24 transactions now done and 2 more open, all coke,<br />and not a single was what i call GOOD quality.<br /><br />there were some (4) though that had at least acceptable quality (that was good enough that i purchased again<br /><br />2 of them had a bad second sending (one also a bad third, which mean i quit),<br />2 others were good awhile, i purchased a couple of times, but finally all got bad batches.<br /><br />(i only do &quot;domestic&quot; because from other countries is too risky for me. <br />and my country is not an english speaking one as you might guess).<br /><br />my experience so far (a short time only) says : nothing really good, you can find acceptable stuff (medium quality at best),<br />but it it is a matter of luck, none so far was long time good.<br /><br />i learn of it that once you find something that you would buy again : rebuy immediately !<br />it might be gone pretty soon (a week -&nbsp; a month).<br />i also learn from it that i will search the usual way again soon.<br /><br /><br />i am talking about coke only, though.<br />it might be very different with other stuff.<br /><br />so it would make sense to at least say WHAT drug/drugs you usually (most time) buy and do.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have had only one bad vendor in over 30 orders and shouldn&#039;t have FE&#039;d ... Lesson learned !<br />My experience on the whole has been good ... <br />SR provides a much safer place for purchasing on many levels. Initial purchases of small qty to establish stealth of shipping and product quality etc. On finding a quality vendor ... stay loyal!<br />No more waiting for dealers that always show 2 hours late or don&#039;t answer or it&#039;s underweight or rubbish or meeting in weird places and handing over cash. No more worrying about the drive home with the latest purchase. A feedback mechanism that enables users to be warned if vendors product,stealth etc is junk.<br />The realization of just how good is SR only occurred during the DDOS attack ... SR is essential !

				I&#039;m lucky enough to live in a state where weed is decriminalised, so it&#039;s never been that hard to get. It&#039;s bizarre being able to walk up to a house, knock on a door and hand over money and get some quality weed. Unfortunately, I&#039;m not so lucky when it comes to psychedelics so SR has been a godsend.

I don&#039;t know who you&#039;ve been getting your coke from, but there are even threads on quality, and people doing tests regularly.&nbsp; So... if you&#039;re having trouble finding good coke under those circumstances: you&#039;re not looking hard enough.<br />89%, 87%; both confirmed.

				Started off terrified of using SR. Finally after a month of researching it and lurking I decided to order 100 tabs of LSD internationally. It arrived flawlessly allowing me to not be as paranoid. Now it seems im fairly comfortable with SR. I have yet to order a drug that contains an odor yet, so I guess im not 100% sold yet.

It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium, in 1966, where it was prepared initially in the form of its racemate (called tetramisole).[1]The two stereoisomers of tetramisole were subsequently synthesized,[2] and the levorotatory isomer was given the name levamisole. Levamisole has been used in humans to treat parasitic worm infections, and has been studied in combination with other forms of chemotherapy for colon cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect.[3] The drug was withdrawn from the US and Canadian markets in 2000 and 2003, respectively, due to the risk of serious side effects and the availability of more effective replacement medications.[4][5] The key toxic effect of the drug is agranulocytosis, a severe depletion of white blood cells that leaves patients vulnerable to infection.<br />Currently, levamisole remains in veterinary use as a dewormer for livestock. The medication has also been increasingly used as an adulterant in cocaine sold in the US and Canada, resulting in serious side effects.[6][4] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 seconds &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread<br />delete<br />mauiguy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you still suck the big one and I&#039;m telling the world.
