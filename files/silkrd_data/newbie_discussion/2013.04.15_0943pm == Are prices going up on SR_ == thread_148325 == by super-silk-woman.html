				With the Bitcoin value going up and down how do the vendors keep up with whats listed in their ads? It also seems like the prices have gone up in between the changes in BTCs value on some things. Maybe its just my bad math! I accept higher prices on SR I know all the reasons why its fair to pay a little more than what you might be used to. I also have no problem with people wanting to make money and not leave anything on the table BUT some vendors charge SO much for their items that it seems like they are out to out price each other for the same product. There is a great community involved with SR but I dont feel some vendors are honest with themselves with what their product is worth but that fear of leaving any money on the table makes them price their items as high as another vendor who might just have a far superior product. Quality can vary and I use feedback ratings to judge that but sometimes paying 3 times the price just isnt worth it. Though if I want something bad enough I will pay what they are asking. Supply and demand. Before anyone gets angry I love SR and I mean no disrespect to any vendor. Its just my thoughts.
