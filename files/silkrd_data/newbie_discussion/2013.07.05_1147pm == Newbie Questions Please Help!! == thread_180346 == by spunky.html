				A couple of &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; questions:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; So I finally got the nerve up and made my 1st purchase several weeks ago.&nbsp; It never arrived so I&#039;m out &quot;X&quot; out of money.&nbsp; Is this normal for first-timers?&nbsp; Is this an initiation period?&nbsp; Does a newbie need to spend over &quot;X&quot; amount of money before a product is delivered?&nbsp; Or do purchases normally takes weeks and weeks to arrive?&nbsp; These past weeks have been the most nerve wrecking experience ever!&nbsp; And every single buyer has had to make that first purchase.&nbsp; I used a reputable vendor that had great reviews.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; I have gotten several PGP keys, but none of them work (or I can&#039;t figure out what I&#039;m doing wrong).&nbsp; I can encrypt and decrypt my own messages.... and that is as far as it goes.&nbsp; I&#039;m not &quot;technically savvy&quot; so to speak, but I&#039;ve read numerous articles and the discussions on the PGP Forum.&nbsp; How bad is it not being able to send encrypted messages (such as a shipping address)?&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; The remaining bitcoins in my SR account are slowly disappearing.... Where are they going?&nbsp; It is expensive to get the bitcoins to your wallet than you get charged again to transfer them to your SR account.&nbsp; You would think that&nbsp; they would be safe in the SR account instead of having to be charged again to transfer them back to your wallet, but now they are magically going away.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the best method?<br /><br />Any info on the above to help out this newbie learn the ropes would be greatly appreciated!!&nbsp; Sorry for all the questions.&nbsp; And if I have posted this in the wrong place, I do apologize.

				there are no stupid questions, just stupid answers ;)<br /><br />did you finalize early on your order? did you encrypt your address when ordering? is your order marked as in transit or still processing?was the order domestic or international?&nbsp; normally an order takes 2-6days domestic and 4-30 days international (after marked as shipped) so it is possible that you have been scammed but it could also be possible that you fucked up when you encrypted your address. <br />have you tried to message the vendor you ordered from since then?<br /><br />about the bitcoins: it sucks but the worth of them fluctuates. are you sure that the bitcoins are disappearing or is the&nbsp; amount of $,â‚¬ or whatever&nbsp; currency you use going down?&nbsp; normally your amount of btc stays the same but its worth may or may not change (atm it goes downdowndowndowndooooown)<br /><br /><br />if this post makes no sense blame it on coke and beer, not me ;)

				your first question this could be a number of problems, incorrect address, fake name used, watched country, even the vendor. i usually only deal with vendors who have at leastbeen here around a year with at least 98 rating. or it could have been lost. anything can happen! in a world this crazy we could be eachothers dad

				Thanks guys for the responses.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#039;t finalized yet, I have a couple of days left.&nbsp; The vendor did have a good rating (98 or above).&nbsp; It was an international order, hopefully I&#039;m overreacting... it&#039;s just taking sooo long.&nbsp; I can&#039;t encrypt anything, I missing a step or doing something wrong, I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />And I didn&#039;t even think about the Bitcoins fluctuating!!!&nbsp; Duh! <br /><br />Drink a beer for me....&nbsp; Better yet I&#039;ll take a shot of whiskey!&nbsp; Thanks again!

Just be sure to thoroughly research the vendor in the forums and only purchase from those with overwelmingly favorable reviews. Everything on The Road runs on reputation, and it&#039;s impossible to build a good one unless you consistently deliver quality product.<br /><br />Have you searched the forums for content from or about your vendor? Also, message them and get some comunication going, if you haven&#039;t already.

				Final received my shipment today!!! YEAH!! <br />The vendor did have a good rating - 98.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on keeping your bitcoins in your SR account or transferring them back to your wallet?<br /><br />Another concern at this point is trying to figure out these PGP keys... I can&#039;t for my life figure out what I&#039;m doing wrong.&nbsp; I have 3 and each one is a private and public key on one key.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been able to decrypt any messages, so I&#039;m assuming I&#039;m doing something wrong. It&#039;s very frustrating because I know you&#039;re suppose to encrypt your shipping address. <br /><br />Thanks to all for the responses!!&nbsp; I do appreciate it!

				I used BitInstant... <br />I&#039;m trying my best to cover my tracks, but all this is new and I&#039;m still learning the ropes.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(&nbsp; &nbsp;I can usually figure things out pretty easy, this PGP key is kicking my ass!<br />

				Did you figure out your PGP problems? You can practice in PGP Club, which is stickied at the top of this subforum.
