				Just got a gram from nod. It&#039;s described as being &quot;straight off the brick&quot; and I gotta believe that&#039;s true cause it&#039;s very high quality. Add in quick shipping and good communications (responded to my query about shipping times within an hour or less) and you&#039;ve got a vendor worth checking out. Pricey, but worth it.<br /><br />SupremeSmoke has some good stuff too that&#039;s cheaper and not quite as premium, but still quite good. And he&#039;s extremely professional with&nbsp; shipping and communications. Don&#039;t know if he&#039;s taking new customers at this time though.

				Nod&#039;s is the best i&#039;ve done from the road, but I haven&#039;t really been searching. there could very well be better. I wish he would do grams again. I can&#039;t make myself fork out almost 500bucks for a ball. the free half gram with express shipping option he has is awesome. a gram of his BTH and a half gram of that coke...thats a spicy meatball. <br /><br />Supremesmoke&#039;s was good for the price - but irrelevant now because he doesn&#039;t do blow anymore<br /><br />UGS - very good. very clean. mellow. <br /><br />thats all I know. I only do coke occasionally. That being said, occasionally over the course of 15 years or so of doing a respectable amount of drugs - adds up to a good bit of experience. I assure you I know what good coke is. its rare, but it does exist on the road.

				My first SR transaction ever was this week and it was with NOD. Ordered at 9am Monday, got to me by 1pm Tuesday. GREAT product--clean, euphoric, no jitters, easy comedown. It&#039;s expensive but I think it&#039;s worth it.
