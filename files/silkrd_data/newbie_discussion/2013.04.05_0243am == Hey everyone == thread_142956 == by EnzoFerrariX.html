				Hey guys I&#039;m Enzo and I&#039;m new to the forum but i&#039;ve been skimming thru alot of posts. Anyways i just wanna let you guys know my initial experiences with SR. My first purchase was from Binxster a marijuana vendor. Some of the older members might know him but not the very new members. Anyways i was making my first purchase but before i did that i was comparing all the vendors to get a good price check. After looking through a lot of vendors I chose binxster because of his price and 100% feedback. I knew of the forums at the time and itd be interesting to look at all the reviews of the vendors and i was trying to look for binxsters but he didnt have one(or any mention in the forums at all) which was a bit suspicious but being a noob i overlooked this. He had a ton of feedback which were all 100%. Only thing was he required FE. I bought a QP and after 5 days from purchase i began to get uneasy so i messeged him and he replied back that it should get to me in 1-2 days. Anyways later that day I check the forums and searched his name. He came up and i saw words like scammer and fake and at that moment i knew i lost a good amount of money. As i thought about it I knew he was too good to be true(he had many different strains, like 10, and really good strains like girl scout cookies and alaskan tf for a very cheap price. I was pretty angry that day but I learned a lot from it. To everyone out there (esp. newcomers) i advise you to NEVER fe and always make sure a vendor can be trusted(search the forums for them and not only that but make sure hes getting good reviews from older members) Binxster had faked all his feedback which was ALOT which means the same could easily be done on the forums so its important to make sure you do a checkup on the people commenting on the vendors reviews too. And also if something seems too good to be true it probably is. after that I bought 2 ozs from Northwestdirect who had a good rep so i bought from him(shiskaberry) It wasn&#039;t too great, not much smell and pretty dry, small popcorn nugs but i was happy that i actually got the product from the vendor. today i bought an oz from coffeeshoprx and lawnmower man who both have good reps and im just trying out different vendors and finding the best (good communication, good product, good shipping time, etc) Anyways learn from my mistake and everyone stay safe! <br /><br />Enzo
