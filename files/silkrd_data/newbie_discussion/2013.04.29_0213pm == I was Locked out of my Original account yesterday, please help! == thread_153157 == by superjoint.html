				Yesterday I wrote in about getting locked out of my account after failing my password 5 times.&nbsp; Don&#039;t eat TcK&#039;s awesome benzo&#039;s when you have anything important to do :)<br /><br />&nbsp;Scout suggested that i make another account, which i did . If I am understanding right I will be able to merge these two accounts? MY only confusion is ...HOW? I figure there must be some come of link that magically appears but with SR so messed up right now, i can&#039;t even see that happening. Does anyone know what the typical scenario is when something like this happens and also, very important, how long does it take, cuz i owe my man some money and one thing in my life i have never been called is a thief.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pardon me for bringing you all about this mess again,&nbsp; i am really just trying to get a clear expectation of what to expect, how long, etc.&nbsp; I did have some coin in my account, but it wasn&#039;t nothing i am too worried about. My mind is a lot clearer today and I think I&#039;ll be able to understand a lot better&nbsp; xD ..... Thank you, superjoint

				You Jokers got me there lol. I was referring to my original account, which i got locked out of for signing in wrong 5 times, meaning i either misspelled my username or word. I was told that I should create another account and that, so that i could &quot;merge&quot; those accounts if that is still possible. apparently this is something SR did in the early days and i am not quite sure if this is still being done. also i was told by someone that i would get ticket from SR where by i would writ down the original info from my first account and whatever else they do. I am kind of ignorant about all this and was wondering where i am supposed to get this ticket from. I can&#039;t access the SR site at all, and am totally dumbfounded on what to do next.<br /><br />IF Anyone knows what the proper procedures are in a situation like this, i would be greatly appreciate any info on this. If scout or bloodbath or anyone with any knowledge about such stuff could please answer me, i sure would feel a hell of a lot better. I know we are all going through this together right now and it really sucks, but the more helpful, factual information we can pass along to one another will bring that much more clarity to what we are going through. It is very important to me that my guy gets paid (i realize he will get paid regardless, but he is such a great guy <br /><br />I want to do anything i can to pay him a.s.a.p.<br /><br />So inclusion, if anyone knows how i get one of those tickets to open my original account, it would be great to know about right now, plus any other info you may have when a situation like this arises.<br /><br />Sincere thanks,<br />superjoint
