(cannot combine with A)<br />Sample: 1x115mg<br />Limit: 20 + people from my original thread (total ~30 pills)<br />Review required.<br />Request keyword: fR6HZ0We (type this in with your request so it&#039;s easy for me to search. <br /><br />Group C - Pre-order sample: pre-order 10-15 capsules (at special intro price), I ship sample first, and you may cancel your pre-order after you tried the sample and didn&#039;t like it. Can be combined with all other offers. <br />Sample: 1x115mg<br />Limit: 50 orders (total 50 capsules)<br />No Review required.<br />Request keyword: ndvBIuIC (type this in with your request so it&#039;s easy for me to search. <br /><br />--------------------------<br /><br />Group S1 - spread the news: Re-post this thread to the product offers thread<br />Sample: 1x160mg <br />Limit: 1<br />No Review required.<br />Request keyword: pwCbKDSP (type this in with your request so it&#039;s easy for me to search. <br /><br />Group S2 - bump the news: Bump the thread S1 linked to after 20 minutes or longer since the last post. <br />Sample: 1x115mg<br />limit: 9<br />No Review required.<br />Request keyword: pwCbKDSP (type this in with your request so it&#039;s easy for me to search. <br /><br />S offers can be combined with all others, so the most someone can get is potentially 2x160mg + 2x115mg. <br /><br />Samples will not be as professionally packaged as normal orders.

				&nbsp;fR6HZ0We<br /><br />I&#039;m from the first thread. As I said there, I&#039;d prefer the option to purchase a second sample so I don&#039;t have to roll alone. If you aren&#039;t set up for that or don&#039;t want to do so, then give my slot to someone else though I really appreciate the offer!

				food for thought...<br /><br />It must be an administrative and logistical nightmare for Officer Dibble to drug bust <br />foreign citizens.&nbsp; First there&#039;s the international treaties and agreements to research<br />to figure out if it&#039;s possible or practical to prosecute Mr Italiano, Mr Frog, Mr Deutsch etc.<br />Then there&#039;s gathering the evidence of transactions from foreign banks.. and foreign bitcoin vendors<br />over which the US govt no direct legal power.&nbsp; Then there&#039;s the issue of extradition for witnesses<br />for US based court hearings, extradition of foreign vendors. Liaising with foreign police forces.<br />Then there&#039;s all the delays caused by appeals to extradition orders.&nbsp; <br />The involvement of specialist international law lawyers.. <br />I can imagine that the prosecution of &#039;foreign nationals&#039; could get really complicated.<br />Officer Dibble doesn&#039;t like it complicated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why USA only ?<br />Do Asian, African, European and Australian bitcoins carry less value ?<br />Why would a vendor want to restrict the size of his market ? .... on a global market place ?<br />Vendors are in it for money, right?<br /><br />Don&#039;t give out your addresses to an unknown vendor.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				By that logic then there would be no new vendors because no one should trust them.<br /><br />I agree giving your home address is playing with fire but that&#039;s applicable to any vendor. Once he has a vendor account&nbsp; and can do things properly, there&#039;s no reason not to give him a chance. Though shipping to a secondary safe house would be best.

I guess I should remove half the people getting samples. I&#039;ll let them know who to thank.<br /><br />Those who signed up, if you think you made the cut, you made the cut.

I&#039;ve seen a lot of threads pop up with people offering a bunch of samples without a vendor account that go nowhere, so you can&#039;t really blame them for being cautious and skeptical.<br /><br />Now that you got your vendor account up, I could link this thread to the product offers section if you&#039;d like.<br />

				Learning and testing pgp is once of the sources for our delay. <br />The other is we randomly came upon some cheap meth. Good quality, so decided to sell that here to make a quick buck. Don&#039;t think we&#039;ll restock though. <br /><br />Listing was up but was in vacation mode, still getting used to being a vendor. <br />We had been a customer here before on several orders, just to benchmark our stuff and shipping methods versus other vendors, and it seems that our shipping method is as good or better than even many weed vendors. <br /><br />Currently finishing spamming to 50, and will create a new post on product offerings. Will remove those pre-order samples since no one wants them. Group A sample sizes will be increased to attract more experienced reviewers.

				RaverLove--just a suggestion, but--you may want to ship sooner rather than later. It will negatively affect your &quot;shipment time&quot; rating, and you don&#039;t want that to happen.<br /><br />Who&#039;s to say this waiting won&#039;t happen again, and that will worry people (especially for domestic shipments which are, naturally, faster).

I need new ink, but otherwise, but handwritten is better than unprofessionally printed. At least looks like a genuine present.

				I&#039;m pretty excited to see the stealth myself. As soon as you add the return lables, it&#039;ll be even better I&#039;m sure.

				REVIEW&nbsp; SAMPLE PACK B – 110mg MDMA Capsule<br /><br />Received my sample yesterday. Raverlove was kind enough to include two pieces in the sample pack.&nbsp; The capsules were clear and contained tiny crystal shards. My initial plan when ordering was to do both about 45 minutes apart but that changed when I went out with a coworker for a drink after work. After mentioning what I happened to be holding he and said he was interested so we each bombed a cap down at about 830pm. I started to feel the come up pretty quick about 905. I did open the cap and swallowed the contents without the gelatin. Was at an Indian casino and the lights and music and even the casino noise started to have that glow. I do have to say I was feeling good but I also felt like I could have used a little more, but, that was just more my tolerance, because it was very clean and nice with no heavy body load. I do have say also my buddy from work was a first timer and for about 45minutes about an hour or so in –he was glued to the chair with a shit eating grin. Stayed out till midnight feeling good and alert got home and smoked a little hash and passed out around 2. Was up for work today at 630, and did my 8 hour shift and still have to say I feel ok. Nice clean dope and was as advertised. Thanks Raverlove- I will be back for more soon. <br />

				Took 10 days to reach east coast usa due to vendor&#039;s emergency but was compensated with 2 extra caps &lt;3<br /><br />I honestly thought I got scammed but he finally came through :)<br /><br />This looks VERY clearer than the stuff I usually get. <br /><br />Some of the shards are literally see through. My assumption is that it&#039;s quality stuff :P<br /><br />I don&#039;t really care if the label is hand written or not, as long info is discarded correctly :)<br /><br />UPDATE: Tested great. Took one of his 140mg extra caps. It was one of the best ones I&#039;ve had. Been getting a lot of stuff that hasn&#039;t been hitting with that euphoria hard and this did it. Long lasting and peaked for a while. This is indeed quality. Next day I feel just hungry cause I didn&#039;t have the stomach to eat last night. Not depressed, but refreshed. I got a lot off my chest and my mind feels clearer. I honestly love the rolls, that feel as if it&#039;s life changing and this did exact that. I don&#039;t like the ones that just give you the fucked up feeling, and drugged up. Honestly a theurpedic night. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for the love R.L.
