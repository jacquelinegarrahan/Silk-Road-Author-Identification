				To all the ketamine users out there (sniffers) - If you get crystals do you cook them or just crush them up and use as crystals?

				dont &quot;crush and snort it&quot;, this is crap, as a regular k user i can tell you that crystals is a compound of the product its not intended to be used as is. <br /><br />dont you ever felt symmetrical painful area in your back while snorting crystals? they are your kidneys :p<br /><br />snorting loads of badly cooked k or crystals will cause bladder damage, diaphragm cramps n so on... In many countries ketamine is sold as is by people who obviously dont know a fuck about it, its like drinking pastis liqueur without water..<br /><br />a good cook is the key to dont suffer from k damage, i use ceramic a ceramic pan and some Deironized water like for domestic ironing. <br /><br />as we often cook big batch of it, the cooking process has to be done slowly n more than one time if you cooking a lot in a row. <br /><br />The effect of the product can be modulated by the cooking process : a fast cooking can produce a strong effect that don&#039;t last long, cooking it repeatedly many time by adding Deironized water can give it a more pleasurable effect than being knocked down after one hit n you wont end up with a plastic bladder.<br /><br />well this was my first post n lil two cents :p

				Wait, I thought cooking K was what people meant when they take a vial and turn it into crystal.&nbsp; If you already have crystal, how and why would you cook it?

But when you cook crystal you turn them into a fine powder making it a lot smoother to sniff
