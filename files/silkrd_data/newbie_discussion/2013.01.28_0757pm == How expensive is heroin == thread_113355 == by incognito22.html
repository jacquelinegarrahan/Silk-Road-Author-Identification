				You can get a balloon for like 10 bucks and get high off of that one time, it only gets expensive when you have to keep buying it due to addiction to get high 5 times a day. Not sure what the prices are like for a small size such as that on SR.

				If you have not tried Heroin as of yet..&nbsp; I would recommend against it.<br /><br />There are some who can try it a few times, and walk away..&nbsp; Either because it wasn&#039;t their cup of tea, or it made em nauseous, etc.<br /><br />Then there are alot who continue to do it time and time again, and things usually start to fall apart for em.&nbsp; It&#039;s a quick way to fuck up a relationship with your significant other if you consider them to be a condescending 3rd party in regards to hard drug use (or any drug use).<br /><br /><br />If you insist on trying dope, go to http://www.heroinhelper.com/curious/&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Now that I look back on previous rendezvous with Heroin in my early years (First tried it at 17), I can say that I was pretty reckless at times, shit even into my adult life fucking with dope.&nbsp; <br /><br />\There have been numerous times in the recent past where I have done too big of a shot, and have woken up on the floor up to a couple hours later.<br /><br />Just remember, if you insist, do alot of reading..&nbsp; Watch some YouTube videos on people in withdrawals if you must.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just go snorting/shooting dope all willy-nilly, or you could end up getting pretty fucked up. <br /><br /><br /><br />I hope this helps some. <br /><br />haberdasher

				Yes 1/10th of a gram costs about 10 bucks at least where I live and what I mean by balloon, it would be enough to get you high as well. Hope this helps and stay safe. Don&#039;t start chasing the dragon.

				Price depends on many factors, like purity, your dealer, how close you are to the original supply, where you&#039;re located in the world, etc.<br /><br />1/10 gram of high-purity heroin to someone who is opiate-naive could cause an uncomfortable overdose, maybe not death but nausea, headache, etc. If it&#039;s your first time, please god don&#039;t IV a whole bag, you could easily die from this kind of irresponsible use. Start with about 10 mg or so.<br /><br />My first time I snorted 30 mg over the course of about 20 minutes, and I was so fucked up I was having minor visuals. Good stuff though, $200 for half a gram and worth every penny. Be careful with H, not something to mess around with casually. I&#039;m just lucky opiates aren&#039;t my thing or I would probably have gotten addicted.

				I&#039;ve seen listings for china white at 300 a gram. If you do a little math that is a lot cheaper then paying 30 bux for a roxie 30

				I would highly recommend that you don&#039;t try it. It&#039;s fun at first but then turns into daily maintenance really quick.

				Its EXPENSIVE. Don&#039;t even think about it<br /><br />I did it every single day for 3 years. Lost my job, my house and nearly my family. The first time I did it I immediately knew why people can live in a cardboard box on the side of a road willingly. <br /><br />1000&#039;s of dollars worth of treament later I&#039;M Clean - and not a day goes by where I don&#039;t think about maybe just doing a little bit.

				You can easily get high, as someone with no opiate tolerance, from 50 mg of heroin.&nbsp; With the really good stuff that can cost $250 a gram on SR, you wouldn&#039;t even need to do that much.&nbsp; On line that&#039;s about as long as your fingernail would do the trick.
