				Have tried the Supermen, Green Androids, and the new Yellow Mario Bullets (The new pill from the green android crew) Not heard of A+ but can say the 3 pills I&#039;ve mentioned are all very good! Nice clean lovely euphoric E buzz. All pretty much the same streng and quality but if I had to pick one it would be the Superman - Not sure why, it was the 1at one I tried of the 3 and it was fuckin amazing!!!

				Can anyone vouch on the comedown for these guys? I&#039;m curious too about these but usually I take it in crystal form and there is virtually no comedown.

				Virtually no comedown. I smashed the shit out of it about 2 months ago. 1 night / half a day on supermen, androids and ket, switched up to 2cb in the afternoon. on it from 8pm Fri to 5am Sunday. Dis some more supermen and ket on the following night. Woke up Monday - right as rain. Had a bit of the shits in the week and 1 night of nightmares but that&#039;s all....<br />Did 2 supermen Saturday 2 days ago, after a valium induced sleep from 7am to 12pm woke up a bit wobbly and a little high still. Felt fine by 3pm and great today.<br />These dutch pills are clean and a really good synth. Best I&#039;ve had in years!<br />so, yeah, comedown in very minimal!

				I can only speak for the supermans, I take an maoi and according to the literature taking e on an maoi is extremely contraindicated (boosts mdma levels in blood, potentially causing serotonin syndrome - nasty), but speaking from experience (having built myself up to this dose over repeated uses) taking half a superman got me all the way there, teeth grinding included, warm, loved up, and heavily into music. Found the comedown to be hardly noticeable, a little depression the next day or so but that&#039;s about it, in my experience.
