				First of all I would like to thank mister m100&nbsp; for his excellent service. The product arrived in some of the best packaging imaginable, I knew what it contained, but It took me a minute or so to work out exactly where it was (I shall not go into too much detail). The product description states &quot;pure MDMA crystals, best there is on the market&quot;. I can&#039;t confirm that it is pure, or for that matter that it&#039;s the best on the market, but it sure as hell will take some beating! I have had many experiences with mdma, and can safely say that this is the cleanest and most potent I have ever had. I don&#039;t think I will be trying any other vendors (I don&#039;t fix what is not broken), so Mister M, you&#039;ve got a customer for life.<br /><br />So now I&#039;m going to attempt to write my trip report. I can&#039;t possibly give you all the details, as this one went on for longer than I anticipated. I weighed out eight 250mg wraps, and set myself up for the night ahead. <br /><br />0:00 - (18:00, Friday) <br />I started off taking one wrap orally with a glass of juice. Put on some music, and relaxed.<br />00:25-01:30<br />I started to get the familiar feeling creeping up on me, starting in my stomach and gradually spreading throughout my whole body, when it finally reached my head, the rushes of euphoria were immense, but not overpowering. I felt my jaw starting to clench slightly, but not uncomfortable. <br />01:30-02:00<br />I changed my choice of music from fairly light funky house to something a little more progressive, this worked wonders! I absolutely love the effect this compound has on every part of your body (except the bit that shrinks, but who needs it when you already feel this good?)<br />02:00-02:45<br />I decide I&#039;m going to see just how good this can get, and swallow another 250mg. I make a few phone call to friends from home, to tell them exactly how good this stuff is, which annoys them a little, as I now live approx 270 miles from them, and they can&#039;t have any, haha. At around 20:35 (02:35) I feel something coming that I haven&#039;t experienced for a while, the jaw judder, the teeth chatter or whatever you want to call it, it&#039;s getting out of control, but makes me laugh very much (reminding me of old times in our local nightclub).<br />02:45-06:00<br />The jaw judder didn&#039;t last too long, but it does return a few times throughout my trip. I did think about eating a few times, but decided it would be a waste of time preparing anything, as I would not eat it. Plenty of nice cool juice and a piece of chewing gum now and then, and I was more than happy. I changed the style of music quite often during this period, and every time I put something new on, it felt right, just the type of music I should be listening to, if you know what I mean. <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to bore you with all the details, so just a couple more things to say. <br /><br />06:00-29:00 (YES 29)<br />I took another 250mg at 06:00, and continued to re-dose every four hours or so up until 20:00 on Sat (26:00). In total I had the full 2g I had weighed out, and loved every minute of it. I must say that a few times I started to feel a little uneasy, like I shouldn&#039;t be doing this to my body anymore, and thoughts about me being too old for this, I quickly dismissed the thoughts, and decided that I&#039;m too old when I&#039;m dead.<br />At one point I did venture out for a walk around the park along the road, and set off with my headphones in. I walked around 200 metres, and decided it wasn&#039;t one of my best ideas, a little too cold. So returned to the house and put the music on LOUD, and had a little dance. I danced quite a lot throughout the trip, it felt great. <br />So at around 29:00 everything started to tail off. I watched a couple of movies, nothing too taxing on my tired brain. The last time I looked at the clock was at around 02:00 on sun (32:00), I drifted off to sleep some time after that. When I awoke 11 hours later, I felt tired, but still very happy! I ate a large breakfast and took some vitamins. I spent the rest of the day payed on the sofa watching rugby. <br />All in all, this was a very enjoyable experience.<br /><br />I have dosed since, and stuck with 300mg, trip duration of approx 7 hours, had a great time!<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks again Mister M.<br /><br />Peace.

				Hi man,<br /><br />No offense but 2g on a weekend is a LOT. You really risk frying your brains here. Maybe you have a big tolerance but even 250mg bombs is hefty. <br /><br />Take it easy and avoid re dosing too much with md, that&#039;s when it get&#039;s really neuro-toxic. Needless to say at this rate you might loose the magic.<br /><br />Peace

				Man every time you take this stuff, you run the risk of frying your brain. If you wanna go there, go all the way. 2g is a damn good night in my back. Of course it is not for everybody. The only way to know your limits, is to find them.

				I find that the maxim &quot;less is more&quot; is often a good strategy with MDMA. I used to take in huge quantities too, but found it was often unpleasant (though it was also often amazing) and had some pretty nasty side effects, like not being able to piss for 24 hours, which in turn gave me crippling pains in my stomach. I now never have more than a third of a gram in one night (usually much less, but this is the maximum I would have, if at a festival or something) and I find the effects better and don&#039;t get the nasty side effects and can usually get some sleep by the early hours of the morning. But, each to their own.<br /><br />Ordered some of M100s gear, so will post a review at some point. His prices are great and I had half a bitcoin on my account from before Xmas; so, in effect I got 2.5g for Â£5!

				I have to agree with a couple of the posters above me, 2 grams is a LOT to take in one session. <br />I don&#039;t want to condescend, because I&#039;m sure you have done your research, but the effects of MDMA are non-linear. Which means you don&#039;t necessarily take more to feel better.<br /><br />Have you tried 150mg doses? Try it once you&#039;ve let your body recover.. You might even find the lower doses to be more enjoyable!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Nice report though :) <br />I find a walk in the early hours very refreshing, as the comedown starts creeping in - walking slowly with a joint in one hand and a cold drink in the other! Aaaaaah!

				Update: Mister m100 cancelled my order without giving me a reason. Presumably to do with sudden drop in btc prices.
