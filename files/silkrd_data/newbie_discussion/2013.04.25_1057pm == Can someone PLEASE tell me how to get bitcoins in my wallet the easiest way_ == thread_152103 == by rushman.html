				confusing trying to get btc im still not that quick on it, but you can by from places like mtgox there reliable but slow, there are other i have seen but not tried im sure someone will maybe come here and advise.<br /><br />Or you can try the listing and search for (i think) name is btc4 cash something like that with a good track record which i think im gonna use next as it seems like very fast service and rates seem reasonable.

				1. Using TOR, go to bitinstant.com and choose to transfer to a bitcoin address<br /><br />2. Copy and paste your Silk Road account address (accessed by clicking &quot;account&quot; on Silk Road and then there a section that says something like &quot;click here to deposit&quot;)<br /><br />3. Make up a fake name, address and phone number which you will give to bitinstant.com and also fill out on one of the blue MoneyGram ExpressPayment slips.&nbsp; Follow the instructions provided by bitinstant.com (you have to download a .pdf at the end of the process).&nbsp; Walmart will not ask to see your ID - they will only ask you to sign a receipt.<br /><br />This worked for me.&nbsp; It is a simple transfer from Point A to Point B.&nbsp; Many here recommend that you complicate this process by sending the money first from bitinstant.com to a service like coinapult.com and then to your SR account for additional security.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try that next time.

				I just posted this in another thread, I think it&#039;s easy and quick.....<br /><br /><br />I use an online BT wallet with Blockchain. You can deposit BTC&#039;s into it via moneygram, moneygram is at any Walmart and CVS, among others but seems like everyone is relatively close to either one. Then move your BTC&#039;s from blockchain to The Road. With this method, you can be funded in an afternoon, it&#039;s really quick. I&#039;ve done it a bunch of times without a hitch. I&#039;m in the good ole U.S of A, I don&#039;t know if it would be any different if you live outside the US. Good Luck!

It will walk you thru the process, which, utilizes bitinstant for the deposit. Again, it will walk you thru it. .Moneygram doesn&#039;t do bitcoiuns per say, it is just used to send money, from their point of view, your just paying&nbsp; bill. <br />Here&#039;s how it works<br /><br />1- create a wallet on blockchain, it&#039;s anonymous<br />2- hit the cash deposit link (this must be done with your wallet page open)<br />3- it will walk you thru the process and give you all the info you need to take to a moneygram outlet<br />4- at moneygram, you will send your $$$ to an intermediate company,given to you by blockchain, I wont mention the name here but to moneygram it looks like your paying a bill...(bitinstant will give you a receiver code for the intermediate co, this code ID&#039;s that company for moneygram so they know who to send it to)<br />4- this intermediate company will do the rest and your dollars will magically appear in your blockchain wallet as bitcoins<br />5- transfer to your SR wallet (it can take a few hours for this transfer to go thru, don&#039;t worry , it works)<br /><br />The reason for the middle wallet is security, and, I&#039;m not sure you can deposit right into the SR wallet, unless you trust one of the SR bitcoin vendors to do it but that is done outside the escrow system and it&#039;s easy for them to burn you, and, they can sometimes take&nbsp; lot longer than most people would like.<br /><br />I hope that all made sense.

So, do the bitinstant thing in your name, go to a first anonymous wallet and then to an SR wallet, that way if they ask for ID it won&#039;t be an issue. Thats how I do it and it adds zero fees and hardly any time.
