				So I asked about where one would find a drug dog or trainer that isn&#039;t LE. no answer (help a member out)<br /><br />but I also got to thinking, any ideas on where the usps gets there xrays? and where they could be picked up at? i know it sounds stupid like you wouldn&#039;t be able to walk into a store and buy one or order one but that&#039;s not your problem. just looking for an idea of who the manufactures and distributors are. <br /><br />self tested stealth seems like the best option. <br />

				Drug dog? That one would be possible. I&#039;d start with google, or ask a police officer. (No, there is nothing wrong with asking a police officer a question). But it takes a lot of work and time (you have to train them from a young age). I think your effort would not pay off.<br /><br />X-Ray machine? Start thinking in the 10s of thousands of dollars, possibly 100s? Plus, special equipment and a place to install it. The only place I can imagine you&#039;d be able to purchase one is through an OEM and being a private individual, you&#039;d have to be damn lucky to get one. If you&#039;re a university or other licenses business that has a legitimate use for it, possibly - but again we&#039;re talking 100 grand here.

				go big or go home?&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)<br /><br />a reason for having one is simple enough. <br /><br />but you&#039;re right it would require a large investment. 10s of thousands would be alright and would even be able to recoup that. 100s of thousands.. not worth it. If things get lost on their way to people then theres nothing else you can do about it.

				http://www.blueskyex.com/index.php?action=searchsell&amp;type=1&nbsp; &nbsp;maybe this is interesting for you.<br /><br />no idea about the prices because you need to register to see them. but could be a starting point at least.

				Food processing factories use xray machines to check the final output for contaminants such as metal bolts or other foreign bodies. I had a glance at a brochure that had been sent to the quality control dept. They appeared to start at around Â£50,000, quite an investment for an individual!!

				Thankyou to both of you for the info and the place to check out. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be registering either but it&#039;s a nice starting point. <br /><br />If they are in the 50k GBP range then you&#039;re correct the investment isn&#039;t worth the time, effort or money. truth be told if they would only xray a small % of your packages in the worst case.

				You can buy awesome K9s pre-trained for law enforcement.&nbsp; You can get ones trained for drugs or explosives or both.&nbsp; I thought about getting one for a few grand because they are so damn cool!&nbsp; They are trained to protect you and your car.&nbsp; They have an attack command a stop attacking command.&nbsp; You can leave them in your vehicle with your wnidow half unrolled and if they see anything happening to you, even far away, they will jump out the window and attack.&nbsp; Really cool German shepherds.&nbsp; Google is your friend.
