				What are peoples&#039; favorite RCs? There are a lot of drugs here (usually one&#039;s in capital letters and numbers) that I&#039;m not really sure of. I know sites like Erowid carry lots of info on RCs but what are SR users fave RCs and what are the different effects?

				25i is amazing. Like being on acid bud cognitive of what&#039;s going on and energetic as hell not to mention the euphoria that it gives you is super nice. But if you can find it 2cb-fly but only had a low dose of it once which was really good. I&#039;m really wanting to try 4aco-dmt has anyone had good or bad experiences with it?

				+1 snark with the Methylone or bk-MDMA. This has been the best RC I have tried to date. You have to take more than MDMA but at the right dose I really doubt if most MDMA users could tell the difference. Around the 200-250mg orally is a good start.<br /><br />Professional legal/semi legal labs producing gear of 99% purity - we are living in amazing times for RC&#039;s. I am sure people will look back and think those lucky devils! I have not noticed a listing for molly that claims much over 80% purity on the road.

It&#039;s not exactly the same trip, but very similar. 4aces is rumored to break down into psilocin in the body the same way that psilocybin does, although I&#039;m not sure how well supported that theory is. I think the general consensus is that it likely does break down into pslocin, but is also active itself, meaning that the trip is a result of the psychoactive properties of both psilocin and psilocetin(4-aco-dmt) in conjunction.

				I would say my favorite RC I&#039;ve tried thus far is 2c-b. Its like MDMA with a more psychedelic twist, but it does trigger some stomach discomfort. I spent three minute tripping balls and thinking I was going to vomit, but it wasn&#039;t nearly as scary as it sounds. <br /><br />For someone a little more daring, DMT. With dmt its all about taking that third hit, then you can say hello to a new world you didnt know existed!<br /><br />Synthetic cannabinoids work well, but do yourself a favor and don&#039;t ever smoke en entire blunt. The cannabinoids in these &quot;herbal incense&quot; packages are much more concentrated than what you find in your OG Kush. Be careful, I have personally experienced panic attacks from smoking too much and I&#039;ve seen one person black out and another go belligerent for about an hour (a grown man lied in his bed screaming and crying). That was...interesting...to say the least.

				Thanks for a wealth of information everyone. I think it&#039;s time for the RC chemists to come up with some snappier titles for their new discoveries, lol. <br />I used to smoke incense every day for a while, but with no idea which compound was causing psychoactivity. Was never as pleasurable as the real thing though. Is there a synthetic cannabinoid that approaches the euphoria of cannabis itself?<br />

				Yeah sure, I know these compounds are dodgy to smoke. Some of the incense blends made you cough for ten minutes or more after smoking. I do not intend to smoke these chemicals anymore, but as most of them come as powder or whatever, i&#039;d like to see what it&#039;s like to ingest or snort the stuff. Sorry to ask the same question again, but which of the many cannabis RC&#039;s replicates best, the euphoria of the real thing?

				A lot of the RC&#039;s have body load.&nbsp; Back in the day, I guess 2CI was the most popular.&nbsp; Hilarious visuals; body load not hilarious at all.&nbsp; Likewise, whatever they&#039;re substituting for MDMA in today&#039;s &quot;ecstasy&quot; sucks balls IMO.&nbsp; Really good MDMA and really good acid have little if any body load.&nbsp; The emotional experience with RC&#039;s isn&#039;t as good either, IME, and that&#039;s what I&#039;m really after.&nbsp; Visuals are a sideshow.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only RC&#039;s I really liked were<br />2-CT-21.&nbsp; Gentle, lovely.&nbsp; Bathes the world in a golden glow.&nbsp; Odd olfactory hallucinations.&nbsp; Not recommended for the average user because it is active at very low doses, most people can&#039;t measure that accurately; one dope died doing a thumbprint. (If you flunked science, stay away from RC&#039;s.)<br />4-Aco-DIPT.&nbsp; Known on the street as &quot;4 Aces.&quot;&nbsp; This is a fantastic drug, intense sexual stimulation, nice euphoria.&nbsp; Only RC I really miss.<br /><br />But dude, there&#039;s&nbsp; reason most people use acid, shrooms, MDMA.&nbsp; They work better and have a better safety profile.&nbsp; (Even MDMA; look up MAPS website -- net net, you&#039;re more likely to croak taking Tylenol.&nbsp; Although to be fair, people croak from Tylenol all the time.)&nbsp; &nbsp;Acid has virtually no body load, the emotional trip is indescribable.&nbsp; You really don&#039;t have motivation to OD on it -- trust me, it&#039;s the gift that keeps on giving -- but even if you did, it won&#039;t likely kill you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Me, I started with MDMA, then experimented with several RC&#039;s, then finally got hold of some really good acid, and at that point found what I was looking for.&nbsp;

				Something i&#039;ve found with the speed/MDMA RCs, is that most of them are much of a muchness. They all differ in a subtle way I suppose but in my experience I would&#039;nt be able to tell blind, which one i&#039;m actually on. I know i&#039;m showing my ignorance here but they just seem like speed or MDMA to me, just with different dosages.

I think the general consensus is that it likely does break down into pslocin, but is also active itself, meaning that the trip is a result of the psychoactive properties of both psilocin and psilocetin(4-aco-dmt) in conjunction.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It was my understanding that the body metabolizes psilocybin into psilocin(which is what you actually trip on), and that 4-AcO-DMT is a synthetic form of psilocin itself. <br /><br />I have to agree with a previous poster that said that the real thing is always better, but consensus seems to be that 4-AcO is a lot closer than most other RCs get to the real deal. <br /><br />Seriously, stay away from the synthetic cannabanoids. There are way too many stories of people having a bad time from taking too much, and a large number of us that have used them for extended periods have experienced all sorts of weird side effects. Actual cannabis is abundant, way more fun, and qualifies as a legitimate medicine instead of being some mystery chemical that most former users will tell you to stay the fuck away from.

So i take it this is the substance most similar to mdma? It&#039;s definitely a good price but you do have to take larger amounts, and it&#039;s just missing that special something. may try some more from another vendor but the one i bought quoted 99.8% quality and it was one big yellow crystal. was a good night for sure tho.

I think a molecule was replaced or something. For me, it is more euphoric than Diazepams and the like and also less tendencies for horrible withdrawals.

				Didn&#039;t realize Etizolam was an RC benzo. That stuff is great. I tried 5-MEO-DMT a while back. The light tracers are amazing but it was a bit harsh on the body. Dunno if M1 is technically an RC but it&#039;s awesome, like MDMA-light. I want to try 2c-? one day, maybe 2c-i.

				I remember some popular Irish-made incense blend where they&#039;d put something utterly noxious in it like Iodine, which made you violently cough for 10 minutes after smoking, can&#039;t remember what it was called, Smoke or something. <br /><br />&quot;i miss mephedrone a lot but had i known what it was when i started taking it (long story) i wonder if i wud have continued. makes me feel a bit old school but think i prefer tried and tested drugs. mephedrone was something else - way worse than crack for me, totally epic but utterly fiendish. i don&#039;t see the point in chasing a replacement.&quot;<br /><br />Sounds similar to my experience with Meow Meow.

				So the mephedrone offered now on SR...mainly thru the UK, is not the same synthesis/strength as the &quot;pre-ban&quot; wonder I keep hearing about?&nbsp; &nbsp;I totally wish I was on the scene when that was going around......totally missed out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				I like 2C-B but wow there is no subtle climb between sober and HOLYFUCK! Even in fairly moderate doses I find the rapid transitions in and out of the psychedelic state pretty jarring compared to a moderate dose of LSD. Very fun though but mind that steep response curve!

				Maybe someone should start a thread where RC&#039;s are listed in regard to the class of drug to which they belong i.e. psychedelic, stimulant, opioid etc. I have little knowledge regarding most of the substances mentioned in this thread, and what the effects of most of them are, so it would be good to see a chart classifying the most popular ones.
