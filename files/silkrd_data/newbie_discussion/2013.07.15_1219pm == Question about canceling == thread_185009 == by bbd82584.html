				prolly not much you can do about it. has he read your messages? how long ago did you send them?&nbsp; &nbsp;maybe maybe you could talk to the support but they take their sweet time themselves and i doubt that they will really do anything.<br /><br />sorry<br /><br />(you&#039;re the guy with the 3.5g right?)

				Yeah that&#039;s me. I&#039;ve ordered from several other H vendors no prob. This has been a major pain in the ass. He messages me last night at 12 telling me I have to fE even though I meet his requirements not to have to. Now isn&#039;t replying to my messages requesting to cancel. Why doesn&#039;t sr allow a customer to cancel while processing? This is fucked. Holding $550+ of mine that I need to place an order to get to me by wed

				from what i understand it is against sr rules for a vendor to insist you FE. so try messaging him that you have no choice but to report him for it. that might force his hand to send without FE. if not then go ahead and report him.

				Hopefully this gets sorted for you soon. My situation is currently a bit worse at the moment as I have FE&#039;d for a big sale due to a lot of people vouching for him and others doing the same who I perhaps shouldn&#039;t have trusted. 20BTC potentially lost but I still have to have hope my package will arrive. Still getting communication from seller but no product.

				I believe you can cancel after four days if the order still says &#039;processing&#039;. But if the vendor marked it &#039;in transit&#039; already (which would be necessary in order to allow you to FE) then you might have to wait and take it to the resolution center.

				I feel for you, bengal, but a situation like yours is exactly what I am trying to avoid. I don&#039;t want to come off as pushy, but I DID qualify to buy from him without this FE nonsense. Again, he messaged me at midnight telling me my &quot;average order total was 5x less&quot; than what I was ordering with him. This is not a custom order. Anyway, Ive sent multiple PMs and no reply, 10hrs later still waiting. Order is sill listed as &quot;processing&quot; and I&#039;m image to click &quot;cancel&quot;. This is FUCKED. SR needs to allow a customer to cancel at any time before an order is put in transit. 11 purchases over the last 1 or 2 months totaling $1,170.&nbsp; He&#039;s saying my &quot;average order $amount is too low&quot;. Yeah, My average is about $110 an order but that&#039;s including a couple orders under $50 and some over $300. The more and more I think, the more this FE request looks rediculous.<br /><br />4 days is unacceptable and far too long I wait. The vendor can&#039;t just cancel on his end for me before that time?!

				The vendor can cancel the order. The vendor is under no obligation to accept any order. But if the vendor doesn&#039;t cancel the order I think it takes four days before the buyer cancel order button is available. I think that&#039;s to give the vendor enough time to mark it in transit if s/he accepts the order since SR does not have any state between &#039;processing&#039; and &#039;in transit&#039;. I noticed Atl. does have a state between those two so that you can cancel the order at any time before the vendor accepts the order (though it does ask you to enter a reason for cancelling, probably out of courtesy to the vendor).

				And the messages I&#039;ve sent requesting that the order be canceled so I could either order something smaller or order from someone who doesn&#039;t req FE have remained Unread. He/she hSsnt read them. Redic
