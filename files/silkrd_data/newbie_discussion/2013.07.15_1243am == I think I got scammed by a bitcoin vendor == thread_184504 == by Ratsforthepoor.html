				I used bitcoinsnow.com.au to buy some bitcoins to make my first transaction here, and so far no bitcoins have been tranferred to my wallet. It has been more than sufficient time for them to be deposited. <br /><br />I have emailed, with no response. Again, there has been more than enough time to send a response. <br /><br />I have called the number on the website during business hours, and it rings a couple of times and goes to a message bank. <br /><br />Now I can&#039;t even get onto their website, even though isitdown shows the website as being up. <br /><br />Has anyone else here had a similar experience with them or even a positive one?

				hey there, give it time my man.... everything in the bitcoin world takes ages and ages. its just the way it is.&nbsp; when bitcoins are sent they are confirmed 6 times or something like that. to upload to sr it takes up to 6 hours. dont worry just yet. how long has it been btw?

				Have you checked with Blockchain.info ?<br /><br />just go there and put in your receiving btc address and see what you can see.

				Check the Blockchain (clearnet) - https://blockchain.info/ - Type your receiving Bitcoin address into the search box and press enter. Doesn&#039;t sound like they will turn up IMO but it will tell you if they have been sent to your Wallet.&nbsp; :(

				Just thought I&#039;d update this. <br /><br />I just checked blockchain.info, turns out no transactions have been made to my bitcoin address. So, looks like I have been scammed. Bunch o&#039; cunts! Don&#039;t do business with bitcoinsnow.com.au!!!

				Really sorry to hear it chap :(<br /><br />I thought it sounded far to long to me.<br /><br />I would advise some trading sites but i guess your in Australia but I deal with hunting for trading sites in UK&nbsp; with good reputation. <br /><br />You might look at MtGOX although there really for quite serious dealers and you may need to verify even just to buy nowadays.<br /><br />But heres my list of reputable sites:-<br />https://bitbargain.co.uk/<br />https://mtgox.com/<br />https://btc-e.com/<br />https://www.bitstamp.net/<br />https://localbitcoins.com/buy_bitcoins<br />https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />https://www.bittylicious.com/<br /><br />And of course if your comfortable with OTC theres<br />http://bitcoin-otc.com/ <br />
