				I&#039;m so sick of the bullshit crappy pills the bikies keep pressing in Australia at the moment. It&#039;s just shit after shit, often with crap mixed in the tricks test-kits.<br /><br />I want to make better ones and flood the market with high-quality rounds. I&#039;ve already acquired a large amount of MDMA, as well as a binder (HydroEthylCellulose), coloring agent (Iron Oxide) and lubricant (Magnesium Stearate). <br /><br />I&#039;ve read up on mixing techniques and how pill-pressing works and have already had a metal-workshop make me up a small home-made press that I can operate with a hammer. Unfortunately this is fucking time-consuming and making 1000 pills would take several days. I need something way faster if I want this to be worth the effort.<br /><br />Can anyone help me or point me in the right direction to acquire or make a good pill press in Australia? I have plenty of money I can spend on making this work and i&#039;m willing to put a lot of effort to make this happen. Ideally i&#039;d like to buy a TDP type machine.

Buying a pill press will attract too much attention unless you have true underworld connections (which by your post, you do not.)<br /><br />Good luck friend. I hate bikies and what they have done to the drug trade in oz.

				Godkiller.. what are you talking about?? the profile name is Aussiemitch.. you spastic!!!!<br /><br />anyone not happy with a 1000 every few days would be very immature... <br /><br />3000 a week would be more than enough to start flooding markets with good beans.... and before you know would be the next CW.. and i have no doubt you would end up like him too...<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry Godkiller but the only thing you have killed is your brain....
