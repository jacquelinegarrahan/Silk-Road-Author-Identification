				Hello,<br /><br />I am curios as to what the demand would be for opium from overseas, esp. because there are currently no vendors w/ listings up that are based in the US. Any thoughts?

				Most people are hesitant to buy opium because if you could get Heroin over opium, most everbody would choose the latter because it&#039;s better, more potent and cheaper. However if you were to sell some and it were cheap enough, I would probably buy a gram or so just for the novelty of it. Never seen opium before.

				That&#039;s what I am also trying to figure out-a good price point. The stuff I can get is very HQ, but I don&#039;t want to take the risk if the reward isn&#039;t there.

				I think the demand would be very good.&nbsp; Some people do just like to get high and heroin is more potent so it is more cost/effective to import heroin.&nbsp; &nbsp;But there are a lot of people who would really enjoy opium as something special and have been on the lookout for it in the US.&nbsp; (I started a thread about it a couple days ago).&nbsp; Opium is a different experience.&nbsp; It has the warmth and euphoria of heroin (though different in some ways) but in addition it can give you &#039;opium dreams&#039;, which are incredible, realistic, colorful, often oriental-flavored dreams if you lie down after smoking it.&nbsp; I have called it a &#039;psychedelic heroin&#039; because of the dreams <br />which occur in a state somewhere between sleeping and waking.&nbsp; There are many like me who are on the lookout for it and I think, since there are no other offerings, that anyone who could offer good quality opium would do very well indeed.

				There was one fellow here who had it for sale at around $30/gram.&nbsp; There is another fellow who I spoke with you will have some, he hopes, which he told me is amongst the best in the world and which would &quot;knock your socks off&quot;.&nbsp; He said he would sell it around $60.00.&nbsp; That is awfully high, but if the quality is as he says, I think he&#039;ll do alright.&nbsp; In Europe you can see the price for good quality opium is around $30/g and is much more available than here.

				if it&#039;s high quality and the right price, people will be ALL over it.. otherwise, they&#039;ll just keep smoking tar, cuz its cheaper and lasts longer and feels better (MOST of the time lol there&#039;s some NASTY tar out there).&nbsp; i would def be interested in some HQ opium, esp. if you were offering it in bulk for resale.. people around here would FLIP if they found out they could get their hands on some good O.. <br /><br />basically yea, i think the interest is definitely there.&nbsp; g out

				Hi Infinity,&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the reward is there for the taking.&nbsp; You&#039;d have a near monopoly on opium sales in the US.&nbsp; Some people just want to get high and for that heroin suffices, but opium has qualities - the warmth,&nbsp; the mystical dreams, the exoticism - which more than make up for the simpler heroin high.&nbsp; How much do you have to invest in initially?&nbsp;

				What is the morphine content in the opium?&nbsp; How high quality is high quality (we talking brown, pink, jelly, etc?)?&nbsp; U selling bulk?&nbsp; Not too many shipping from domestic out there I&#039;d say there is potential interest :)<br /><br />Thanks.

				Opium is so rare in America that it would sell just for the novelty I would think. Shit, I bought some from The Scurvy Crew , shipped to the US from Spain just cause I wanted to give it a try. The Scurvies gear was very good by the way, at least to this O rookie. I&#039;m no opiate rookie, but Opium, I never tried. I did smoke some hash in the 80&#039;s that the person who had it claimed was mixed with O but for all I know he was full of shit.

				88,&nbsp; did you lie down when you did the opium to see if you&#039;d get opium dreams?&nbsp; The dreams can be fantastic and that is one thing which&nbsp; opium can give you but heroin can&#039;t.&nbsp; No one seems to mention it, but that&#039;s the whole point of opium in my opinion.&nbsp; As soon as I see a domestic (US) opium listing go up, I intend to buy it.&nbsp; What do you think, Infinity?

				Opiates, in general, often give me oddball dreams, if that&#039;s whatcha mean by opium dreams.&nbsp; Are you just talkin bout noddin n dreamin, cause, yah, I did plenty of that. Opium was fun, and like I said, where I live anyhow, it&#039;s so rare that I haven&#039;t met many folks who have ever seen it, let alone try it. I&#039;ve heard some dudes claim that black tar H is opium , and they&#039;ve probably never even seen tar except on TV . We see powder in my part of the country, tar just isn&#039;t here.

Plus there&#039;s something about the smell I really liked, at least the kind this guy had. Like you were literally smoking flowers haha.<br /><br />Very newbie question though - when I tried it, it was like a dark brown slightly tacky moldable substance and we would literally smoke it out of the same bong we used for weed. Is that the general, uh, method for delivery into ones system? Like could I roll up a little and put it in my everyday pipe, or do you need special &#039;opium paraphernalia&#039; of some kind?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Treat Opium like THC oil. Don&#039;t put a flame to it, that wastes it. Vaporize it for best effects.

				Yeah.&nbsp; I think a vaporizer would work well as long as you clear out the ash periodically.&nbsp; I&#039;m told that the heat setting should be relatively low also.

				Yeah I think there would be a demand. I know a lot of people who would at least try Opium who would never think of trying heroin. I was surprised there were no US options.

				I would definitely buy a few grams off you to try.<br /><br />And everyone saying Heroin is cheaper than Opium, it seems like Opium is only like $50 or less a g on the road, while heroin costs much more than that?

				canada reporting in, definitely interested.<br /><br />i&#039;ve been looking forward to try Opium since i was a kid and still haven&#039;t..!<br />and i&#039;m not the only one, i have a couple of friends who have the same wish.<br /><br />I like opiates, got my fair share of speedballing with Oxy and Hydro, but i&#039;m pretty sure i&#039;d get hooked way too fast on H, even if i only smoked/snorted it, so Opium is the only opiate i&#039;m still looking for.

				Am waiting to return from vacation, i leave tomorrow, before ordering but O and Methylone are the first two things i was gonna get. Price is competitive enough for me to take it overseas but if you can keep up i would gladly buy from you.
