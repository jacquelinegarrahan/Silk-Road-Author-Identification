				Yeap! I have done it. Not only to my girlfriend but also to a friend of mine. <br /><br />But let me explain myself before everyone starts calling me pervert!<br /><br />In my country when you step on sea urchins and you got lots of spikes inside your foot, the first think we do before trying to pull them out is to piss on it. The ammonia that the urine contains &quot;kills&quot; the urchins spike and they don&#039;t allow them to get deeper. The spikes are kind of poisonous and urine helps a lot! And this might be an urban myth, but in my experience it helps a LOT. So yes, I have pissed (just a bit) on my gf :)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=212943.msg1546986#msg1546986">Quote from: The Enlightened on September 18, 2013, 04:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I wouldn&#039;t piss off her either<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Totally agreed!! haha<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz

				So,I can still remember the moment my gf asked me to do it for the first time.I was stunned,this is a very sexy girl and I would never think to do something like that for my own pleasure and I knew she had never asked a guy to do that before.But it was a sign of how much she trusted me.I can say when I did it,the look in her eyes of completely being turned on was something i&#039;ll never forget.When you can be the first in a womans life for anything your ahead of the game.Trust me there&#039;s alot more disgusting shit a girl could ask me to do that I wouldnt.But hell its just piss,it washes right off.If your girl wants it,don&#039;t be a pussy.

				If she really wanted me to I probably would.&nbsp; I know she&#039;d never ask for anything that crazy (loves sexy but pretty traditional.&nbsp; Only tried anal once in her life???&nbsp; Thats legal?), neither would I.&nbsp; I definitely would get no pleasure out of it but I would absolutely do it just for the experience.

				Sure, whatever floats her boat, we all have our little kinks, she scratches my back i&#039;ll scratch hers ;)<br /><br />Whatever goes on behind closed doors behind 2 consenting adullts is none of any of y&#039;alls business, and the ones shouting EWW THATS GROSS MAN are most likely the ones who jack off to pictures of water sports and feel ashamed of it ;)

				Its funny the difference between having a piss and a shit, I have no problems having a piss anywhere, in the street, next to mates etc and will gladly conduct a conversation or take a phone call during proceedings. A shit however is a different animal altogether, it is a deeply personal experience, I don&#039;t even like anyone else to know that I&#039;m having a shit, I hate it if someone knocks on the door or starts talking etc... if I&#039;m forced to take a dump in a public loo I&#039;ll usually put my headphones in to block other sounds out.
