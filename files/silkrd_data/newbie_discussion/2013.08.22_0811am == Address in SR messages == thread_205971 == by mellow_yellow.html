				My vendor forgot something with my order. He is now requesting my address though the message system to send it out to me. Is this as safe as sending it though the order form? I know with the order form it is encrypted then deleted. Is it a security risk to send address / personal info in the SR message system?<br /><br />Is sending my address (without PGP) any less secure then when i send it through the order form (without PGP)????

				Should be fine if you encrypt it with the vendor&#039;s PGP key. You can always message them with a message saying &quot;I hope that&#039;s deleted&quot; after your order arrives.

Then, as soon as your vendor marks your package with the address and confirms shipment, the address is deleted forever and is irretrievable. For the extra cautious, you can encrypt your information yourself with your vendor&#039;s public key. This way, even if the Silk Road server your address is on were compromised, your address would still be safe.

				I normally dont use PGP when ordering but I am wondering if sending address using the message system is less secure than though the order form.

				PGP PGP PGP!!!! Youtube it and it wont take you a total of 15 minutes.... if your vendor isn&#039;t set up for PGP get yourself a new vendor!!! Just saying the whole point of this place is to make money/get what you want AND STAY SAFE!!! If he/she is putting your safety at risk you have to ask yourself are they really worth buying from?

				I&#039;ve been all over the you tubes looing at tutorials for PGPGPGeee. And I can&#039;t figure out if my messages are sending.<br /><br />I sent a message to a vendor I&#039;m interested in and asked him to let me know if he got it. But its 5am so I doubt I&#039;ll find out anytime soon.<br /><br />Where do the pgp encrypted files go after you export them? Do they just show up on the persons command prompt? Or do they have a special folder that PGP files go to. <br /><br />Or am I supposed to attach it to an email? Or what? Help please. Before everything gets buried in spam again. Thanks.

				you should never order without pgp so either way its not secure now. might as well send it in a message, just as unsecure as sending it through the order box. dont order from vendors who dont use pgp if they arent smart enough to figure it out they arent smart enough to be dealing on sr.
