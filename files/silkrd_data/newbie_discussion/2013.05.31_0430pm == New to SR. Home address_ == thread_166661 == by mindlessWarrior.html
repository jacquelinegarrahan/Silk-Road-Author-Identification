				It&#039;s not too good to be true but it does require a certain amount of research and preparation. YES is necessary to learn pgp. You don&#039;t have to use it for all correspondence but it&#039;s essential when giving your address to the seller. I used the following tutorial to learn. I&#039;m on a mac though so it won&#039;t apply to windows.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7753.0<br />

There are opposing opinions on this, however, and you can view some of the discussion about it in the Shipping forum. You will be able to post there once you reach 50 posts.<br /><br />PGP is absolutely necessary - it keeps your information secure and protected, and it&#039;s quite easy to learn once you familiarise yourself with the terminology. You can check out the Newbie PGP Club here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0<br /><br />You should also read the Silk Road Wiki in full - it contains a wealth of information necessary to keep you (and your funds!) safe:<br /><br />SR Wiki:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page<br /><br />Libertas

Yes of course ordering smaller amounts is safer, however the best thing for you to do is read vendor feedback, look for good consistent stealth/packaging ratings and then contact the vendor directly if you have any other questions about stealth. (Just don&#039;t ask them exactly what it looks like because Vendors don&#039;t go into detail for security reasons). <br /><br />Whatever you use, make sure it&#039;s a real address, that you have access to, and the owner of said address/mailbox is someone you are very cool with. Also never use a fake name or different name to different address.&nbsp; The goal isn&#039;t to use methods to hide yourself, it&#039;s to blend in. Consider the sheer volume USPS deals in. Anything out of the ordinary is pretty much the only way you will probably have a package scrutinized. <br /><br />PGP? ABSOLUTELY. It&#039;s not hard AT ALL, if you just follow directions and practice it a couple of times. If you can install and run TOR successfully you can use any good PGP program.&nbsp; It&#039;s too easy to use with benefits far too high not to. PGP not only encrypts your messages, you can use it do verify PGP signed messages so you know the sender has A) the private key to sign it in that fashion and B) the passphrase to sign it.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want messages floating around in plain text that has information about you personally.&nbsp; Security is a group effort. <br /><br />From the silk road wiki, information on pgp. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=PGP/GPG_Encryption <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s my opinion as a newish user of SR.&nbsp; Except the PGP isn&#039;t opinion, it&#039;s absolutely necessary if you ask any rational person here. <br />

(You have to configure a browser to send traffic through TOR so you could have your TOR browser and then a seperate web browser for &quot;Clearnet&quot; stuff. Clearnet is the internet outside the TOR network. Non hidden services).<br /><br />While you access a site/service in the TOR network, your network packets stay within TOR. However if you want to access something in the clear, the packets first enter TOR because that&#039;s what they are supposed to do, and THEN they handle your request. TOR cannot protect you once your information leaves the network, and before it enters it.&nbsp; Again, a small step to take for the sense of mind of added security. <br /><br />So if it doesn&#039;t have an .onion address, your best bet is to open it in a seperate we browser. (Not tab within your TOR browser, but a different browser with different configuration for it&#039;s proxy).&nbsp; Use more conventional proxies if you need to be anonymous in a non TOR browser. I like www.ninjacloak.com (clearweb warning)

				The main points for a buyer to focus on are:<br /><br />1. Getting bitcoins into your SR account without leaving an obvious trail.<br />2. Picking the correct vendor, paying close attention to their shipping and stealth reviews.<br />3. Learning pgp so that, when you talk to the vendor, your details are encrypted.<br />4. Making sure that, if it all goes to hell, your house and computer are clean and that you look as innocent as possible.<br /><br />That&#039;s an oversimplification but focus your research on those areas and you&#039;ll do fine.

				Assume everyone wants to scam you, and play it smart. I usually message a vendor and judge if I will buy from him through that. If he ignores me, I ignore his listings. If I can&#039;t understand him, I ignore his listings. If he is pushy, I ignore his listings... etc.
