				Hello! I&#039;m Mental, and I&#039;m a new user/customer of Silk Road. My connections around where I live are virtually impossible to find, so I&#039;ve come to SR to procure goods.<br /><br />I have a question concerning digital goods. I recently purchased some digital goods from a vendor, and they said that it would be delivered through the SR messaging system. Do they mean the same messaging system I send messages to vendors with? The vendor already confirmed the order and it has been &quot;in transit&quot; for a few days(auto-finalize has 16 days left), but I haven&#039;t received my digital goods yet. Am I just being impatient, or would the goods have been delivered by now?<br /><br />Thanks, and hello again,<br />Mental

				Digital goods like books usually take like 5 minutes to arrive. Maybe the vendor requires FE and 5 star feedback before he sends the goods (check his page). FE wouldn&#039;t really be a problem since books are usually around $0.5 dollars anyways. Maybe you could try to PM the vendor asking him why you still haven&#039;t received the item? I would be careful about downloading PDFs and other files like that though, since they can be used by law enforcement officers to track you. Check out Pine&#039;s thread about that.

				Yes, most likely they mean the same system you can use to communicate with vendors. As wwizard already mentioned, it is safer to don&#039;t download the files with your regular pc/ip address.

				Thanks for the feedback. I contacted the seller and he still says &quot;SR will deliver it soon&quot; so I figure I&#039;ll resolve if nothing happens. I paid 1.13 BTC for the purchase and this is one of my first orders so I&#039;m not so keen about FE until I get what I paid for.

				I really wish that SilkRoad had more decimals for Bitcoin prices. They are a bit too expensive right now!
