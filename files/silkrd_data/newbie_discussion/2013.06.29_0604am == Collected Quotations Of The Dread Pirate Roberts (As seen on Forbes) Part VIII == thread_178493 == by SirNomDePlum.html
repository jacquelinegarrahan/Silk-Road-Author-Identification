				&nbsp;In response to a user who asked to give DPR a hug:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“*hug* Hugs not drugs…. no wait, hugs AND drugs!” <br />[/font]<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=19590.msg198116#msg198116)[/font]<br />And finally, on what inspires him:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“Hey gang,[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />I read more than I post in the forum, and my posts are rarely of a personal nature. For some reason the mood struck me just now to put the revolution down for a minute and just express a few things. There is a curtain of anonymity and secrecy that covers everything that goes on behind the scenes here. It is often fast paced and stressful behind this curtain and I rarely lift my head long enough to take in just how amazing all of this is. But when I do I am filled with inspiration and hope for the future. Here’s a little story about what inspires me:[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />For years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted. I searched long and hard for the truth about what is right and wrong and good for humanity. I argued with, learned from, and read the works of brilliant people in search of the truth. It’s a damn hard thing to do too with all of the misinformation and distractions in the sea of opinion we live in. But eventually I found something I could agree with whole heartedly. Something that made sense, was simple, elegant and consistent in all cases. I’m talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />From their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny. But such vision was a curse. Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit. It was horribly depressing. Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out. But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones. I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance. How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies. How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able. I saw a better way, but knew of no way to get there.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />I read everything I could to deepen my understanding of economics and liberty, but it was all intellectual, there was no call to action except to tell the people around me what I had learned and hopefully get them to see the light. That was until I read “Alongside night” and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III. At last the missing puzzle piece! All of the sudden it was so clear: every action you take outside the scope of government control strengthens the market and weakens the state. I saw how the state lives parasitically off the productive people of the world, and how quickly it would crumble if it didn’t have it’s tax revenues. No soldiers if you can’t pay them. No drug war without billions of dollars being siphoned off the very people you are oppressing.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />For the first time I saw the drug cartels and the dealers, and every person in the whole damn supply chain in a different light. Some, especially the cartels, are basically a defacto violent power hungry state, and surely would love nothing more than to take control of a national government, but you average joe pot dealer, who wouldn’t hurt a fly, that guy became my hero. By making his living outside the purview of the state, he was depriving it of his precious life force, the product of his efforts. He was free. People like him, little by little, weakened the state and strengthened the market.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />It wasn’t long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road, and what a ride it has been. No longer do I feel ANY frustration. In fact I am at peace in the knowledge that every day I have more I can do to breath life into a truly revolutionary and free market than I have hours in the day. I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />We are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor. It’s a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society. All manner of corporation, government agency, small family businesses, anything that can gain a foothold and survive. But the environment is rapidly changing and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road. You can see it, but you can’t touch it. It is elusive, yet powerful, and we are evolving at a rapid clip, experimenting, trying to find sturdy ground we can put roots down in.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />Will we and others like us someday grow to be tall hardwoods? Will we reshape the landscape of society as we know it? What if one day we had enough power to maintain a physical presence on the globe, where we shunned the parasites and upheld the rule of law, where the right to privacy and property was unquestioned and enshrined in the very structure of society. Where police are our servants and protectors beholden to their customers, the people. Where pace our leaders earn their power and responsibility in the harsh and unforgiving furnace of the free market and not from behind a gun, where the opportunities to create and enjoy wealth are as boundless as one’s imagination.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already. Will it happen overnight? No. Will it happen in a lifetime? I don’t know. Is it worth fighting for until my last breath. Of course. Once you’ve seen what’s possible, how can you do otherwise? How can you plug yourself into the tax eating, life sucking, violent, sadistic, war mongering, oppressive machine ever again? How can you kneel when you’ve felt the power of your own legs? Felt them stretch and flex as you learn to walk and think as a free person? I would rather live my life in rags now than in golden chains. And now we can have both! Now it is profitable to throw off one’s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically. How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets? The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips![/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />I have no one to share my thoughts with in physical space. Security does not permit it, so thanks for listening. I hope my words can be an inspiration just as I am given so much by everyone here.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />Dread Pirate Roberts” <br />[/font]<br /><br /><br />THE END <br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to educate yourself, love, learn and fight the good fight.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am SirNomDePlum, I am nothing, I am no one<br /><br /><br />Once more into the fray<br />&nbsp;Into the last good fight I&#039;ll ever know<br />&nbsp;Live and die on this day<br />&nbsp;Live and die on this day<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.20 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFHLSNsBCAC+qEi0MuM/pKHwLtuiX05ObO0S2te/Z/1tSYfu0qaOtv1Fz+B3<br />x9Q164CM9DmWfglXoH99Xpi+DNzqnOPC6gbOH22avxKb75q2pNZ+KRVCL+ifXmH5<br />+qK719HzcjucdLiRhXv5F11M6DprUwNldAbtbMffgHAuoYTPZTRf12WeUhxiLbK4<br />CnVuOuKBpKBxqUR9hrfhywIPHiD93ct/yA1qlkHCk1MNncPTtVqrAI3O57thwCtW<br />7kAMx4bZyOMAbqFtqpnbAs9pryz4QakagZB4/QTkl9+KinT3ukTBLsoz/YlnGJhs<br />r6yOhqSY7qiV42TDmCjBoQ3FkNydPPRPnorlABEBAAG0J1Npck5vbURlUGx1bSA8<br />c2lybm9tZGVwbHVtQHRvcm1haWwub3JnPokBOQQTAQIAIwUCUctI2wIbAwcLCQgH<br />AwIBBhUIAgkKCwQWAgMBAh4BAheAAAoJEFtYr1eEKHXeJSsH/Aoy7lkWukXcQHKM<br />O6/vz2sE3Uat/Gv6eQijlHLUusyQptmPbNusFY13j0Ry9TUG9gKnYcdoiGMszF9q<br />jUnUlG4toeoy7l+zj6XsTd3bsGW+rMhO4c1v/kQAKhVJyUH9UaOvqhBS+uCquJOP<br />5ZPeeWyg1s6GTbqiaZSw19OSspwGtrK7FrIYHwcs5+pTKQcieL4mWrktEhrTcTsC<br />/e5MfZ0aylQrnL1z/DDcLnEf9xJcJglPtz+d6OvTbVjswGX24LM0QlaYTRro4uyF<br />F38CebPZgpV3urYCHFoQvvqtZmlHUqQs73m0xTE3txy5pLP48NeQKftoqh+zajdk<br />vvOjeci5AQ0EUctI2wEIALFkKpn/7MOT+xepaKoqGfrdpzDfgUwD+VQGlOyM5H2M<br />EcjPk8nTPF3Oau6uf41p9x8qux3Qq1XYOMczoGeFaNAZrQtYKS5Ylot1LGWX7TVz<br />9Zg7qLjIl6y0Q0ZgcB7Yv3sNMyN29l5s47hBAfXCSMlawBdz5Y8ufkcHBstXQ0Px<br />BTVxKXURuOPVwhh7ylnoDT3dGBD+tGwZ13aBOfc2nGBN8IP+SZA72T0DPM+F5XX0<br />odqASaOFOOelbm6rP0wh5mLzuiF5gCsxa4nuzE8ShkKv5QMOjSuhOwrZd6mPMe18<br />3fC+HZtQfMd2QshUzbJaM+i6TSK+2E5G4aFqlL3/UWsAEQEAAYkBHwQYAQIACQUC<br />UctI2wIbDAAKCRBbWK9XhCh13qyYCACIPuMg4Whk4CocvDbrOKW5g4VKgZhFaqQr<br />WIs0mq3j4crNnybiR40BpexPz4mv5/leKkjFora5LAju6EF5xoJr1tVkcAmBntvB<br />YDqBL1k3laRdS7BlVob/du9XMRnO8fZWGfW7weOiZydxNb87+dP6oVIRRGWcfArc<br />PQTtnzPD8szV+Xr9UqB0gzTBWCRkBmPzdGWiR5IbUQS27SOkxcRXm4plz4Hg9HVZ<br />Lbzdz8YV0Q8q7O7Sir9Vf1bEX8viFFSaBO+Sa/PcZdukAAUmaKbwYsZjR8jZeya+<br />/qqK52zZXxnVx6PFbOYiok2x37JrtFOjDCM7gGQ29wY497CJjKTK<br />=8HTc<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=16070.msg157812#msg157812)[/font]<br />&nbsp;
