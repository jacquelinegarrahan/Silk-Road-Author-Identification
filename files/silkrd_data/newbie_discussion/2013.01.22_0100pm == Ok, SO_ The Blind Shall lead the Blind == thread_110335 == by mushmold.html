				Fellow newbies, or Jr.newbs who care to read these Spam infested waters, what are the rules beyond just getting 50 posts? Beyond the obvious of being civil and helpful to each-other?&nbsp; <br /><br />I will start out with a simple question: how many use their SR nic on the forums? I am not, and why should I?&nbsp; Now it does make sense for a vendor to, unless they are in stealth and up to no good etc. ...<br /><br />But I will say one other-thing, often wisdom can be gleaned from reading and not impulsively intervening,&nbsp; In other words we can still read the forums (as can all of the Internet, clearnet/darknet included)&nbsp; but we will have to post our way here to further our greatness. <br /><br />Mushmold

				IMHO its a good concept that you should need 50 post to join post in the main forum. It weeds out the people who sign up but do not have the dedication to security and procedures to maintain this site secure. And as far as using my nic , why not? My ID on her and the main site are the same for purposes of continuity. I want vendors and senior members to know it is actually me who is posting when it comes to a product/service review.

The only thing you can gain from doing this is maybe a more favourable deal from some vendor, maybe they&#039;ll give you the good stuff if you honestly review product, or maybe they don&#039;t like your tone they&#039;ll send you ground up glass. Maybe they&#039;ll sell your identity to some punk who wants to rape your wife and eat your kids.<br /><br />You stand a greater chance of losing your anonymity if you use the same name on both sites. IT security call it surface area, spies call it exposure, hackers call it protecting your dox. As a matter of principle you should protect any information that could be valuable to any present or future enemy, it&#039;s common sense.<br /><br />If a dealer is busted because of the shit they get up to offline then there&#039;s a chance that the law get hold of your details and tie your username to your identity. In case this happens then you better not get involved in conspiracy to launder money or smuggle drugs on these forums because every word you&#039;ve typed is tattooed to your home address.<br /><br />Me on the other hand, I can post about where the bodies are buried without worrying about any of that shit coming back to haunt me, I can tell vendors who think they&#039;re gangster to suck my balls if I want. I&#039;m a free man, or maybe I&#039;m a woman, whatever I am is none of anyone&#039;s business.

				I guess I should have prefaced that by saying that I already took precautions with my personal information before I even thought about posting a single word on this site. Most people wont take the steps to establish layers around their personal data or if they do , it one , maybe two at best. I understand where your coming from and it is a valid point for most user but if you take the right precautions beforehand , there is no reason to fear data compromise. Plus , if you are careful with your word choices and how you describe yourself , even the most through analysis of my data leaves you knowing almost nothing. For example , don&#039;t ever talk about your physical location outside of a properly encoded PGP message and so on. Its all risk management and to what degrees you apply it.

				Thank you for the replies. I think I will stick with the anon id here on the forums. SR is a wonderful place and I hope all will treat it with respect. I can also understand the 50 post rule, but already I see spammers spamming their way past it, so without Sr. Mods here watching for this kind of activity it is self defeating IMO. I also think we need a Sr. mod or at least members to participate here, otherwise it is as my subject head...<br /><br />Mushmold
