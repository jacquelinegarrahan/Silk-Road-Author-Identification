				Is there such a thing as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; DMT? I had the most phenomenal experience on some DMT from BuddhaNature but then I saw someone say it wasn&#039;t very good DMT. It was the first batch I tried.

				I&#039;ve done quite a bit of self extracted dmt through the years, in my experience purity effects dose more than effects. Depending on how you vape it purer stuff may be easier to vape too. I&#039;m not sure if it had anything to do with purity but a buddy puked off of 100 mg of some unwashed stuff vaped from a volcano vaporizer. Could have just been because it was his first try and it was way too much for him though.

				It&#039;s really easy, googling it will bring up a lot of different techniques. Personally I like to start with mimosa hostillis powdered root bark and do large scale acid base extractions. The easiest and quickest way to do it is to use a straight to base method where all you have to do is mix some distilled water with your bark then raise the ph (I use sodium hydroxide although it&#039;s important to note that a wash is probably necessary if you use such a powerful base. Nobody wants to smoke NaOH). You then add your choice of non-polar solvent, I use naptha, and shake the shit out of your container. It&#039;ll get hot, you&#039;ll want to do this in an hdpe plastic container so the high ph doesn&#039;t immediately destroy your container, it&#039;d be one hell of a mess. After leaving it and shaking it for a couple of days (always vent after shaking) you separate the clearish naptha layer from the gross blackish layer, make sure no black is in you&#039;re naptha. Then just throw it in a really cold freezer, leave it for a couple of days and use a filter to get your dmt once it freeze precipitates out.<br /><br />But yeah you should probably google it if you want details.
