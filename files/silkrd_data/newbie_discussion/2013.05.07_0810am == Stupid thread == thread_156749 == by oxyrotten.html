				Dear moderators,<br /><br />By now you&#039;ve probably been enchanted by the buffet of bullshit served up by Mr. RxKing in his Fake Contest that was busted up and exposed.<br />Is that even allowed? There has to be some rule he violated (other then the general rule of being dishonest and lying and not honoring his words and being shady and changing his statements every 5 minutes).<br /><br />Is this against Silk Road rules? I can think of a few rules he broke. First of all, a vendor was conducting &quot;business&quot; (it was business since the main site was down, and in order to &quot;give away&quot; the (Fake) &#039;winnings&#039; to his &quot;customers&quot; he&#039;d have to be obtaining their shipping information through the forums)<br /><br />If it&#039;s not against any rules per say, what do you moderators feel about how he changed, evaded it, and finally made a sneaky copout? What are you englightened opinion about it? Do you recommend other vendors do a similar publicity stunt?<br /><br />Looking forward to you response.

				I&#039;m not touching this with a ten-foot pole other than to say that while the site was down, vendors weren&#039;t prohibited from selling through email, forums, or elsewhere.

				:) I think your answer is the diplomatic answer where one can read between the lines. <br /><br />I (and everyone else) will most likely take it to translate into:<br /><br />1) No, he broke NO rule by holding a fake/fraudulent contest<br />2) Yes, holding a fake/fraudulent contest for cheap publicity gimmick is a very shitty/shameful stung to pull.<br /><br />Thank you for your answer Scout!
