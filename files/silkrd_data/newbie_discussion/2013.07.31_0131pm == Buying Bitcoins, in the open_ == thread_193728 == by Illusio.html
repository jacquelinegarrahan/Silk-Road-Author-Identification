				Hi <br /><br />I&#039;m about to buy some bitcoins from a vendor who will buy them in my name on a stalk-exchange: could something like this be compromising? I&#039;ll pay him directly from my Bank-account&nbsp; <br /><br />Also a different question; When I buy on SR can I get the payment fixed? So I know how much money I need to transfer. I don&#039;t want to wire too much or too little. <br /><br />Noob-questions I know! <br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				BTC always fluctuate, buy %10 more than you need.<br />I wouldn&#039;t be buying from anyone here with anything that ties you to the real world.<br />Check the forums, people have been right where you are...

				Hi thanks for replying. <br /><br />The vendor is not involved with SR in any way (I think). Legit and everything, so no problem there https://bitcoinnordic.com/index_en.html <br /><br />I guess the main problem would be if the wallet on SR can be tracked to be a SR wallet? (IDK if that makes sense)

				&quot;Laundering the bitcoin&quot; - is really unnecessary. When receiving coin into your personal wallet you can always generate a new receive address. <br /><br />I presume bitcoin fog is for people that don&#039;t want to keep their own bitcoin wallet. However, that&#039;s kinda weak and you should install a wallet, let the blockchain update and manage your own coin.

				the best bet to buy coins in the US anonymously now is through localbitcoins.com from a guy like this<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/mrbrownfuzz/<br /><br />that has bank cash deposits and cash in mail if you have the time to wait.&nbsp; this way, your coins are anonymous from the beginning, so there is absolutely no need for fogging at all before SR, even if that were necessary.<br /><br />All you have to do is go to your local Bank of America, Chase, or Wells Fargo, follow the instructions, and you could have your unmarked coins in a matter of minutes.&nbsp; I have had the best experiences with these methods, both cash in mail and cash bank deposit.<br /><br />Best of luck to you!

				Just bought some bitcoins off a local seller. Just wondering is it safe to transfer these directly into SR, or would it be wise to do something with these first (e.g. transfer between wallets). Considering using Bitcoin fog, is this worth doing?<br />Thanks for the help
