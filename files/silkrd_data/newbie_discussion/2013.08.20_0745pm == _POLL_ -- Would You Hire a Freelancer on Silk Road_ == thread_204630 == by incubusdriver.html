				I&#039;m a freelance writer interested in selling services on the Deep Web - so consider this market research!<br /><br />I&#039;m a well-established copywriter in the &#039;real world&#039;, and am wondering if it would be financially sound to stump up the bond to become a seller on SR, selling only my writing services as opposed to physical goods.

				I would consider it&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />There are actually lots of ghost writing and similar offers under the Services category already, I believe. It&#039;s worth a shot, I&#039;d say go for it. You might not make a ton of money right away, but over time I think it would pay off.<br /><br />Best of luck,<br />The Fun Roulette

				Ah, I see that category now - I&#039;d only looked at &#039;Writing&#039; before posting this, which has only 10 items listed.<br /><br />Still, got to save up for my BitCoin Bond before listing as a vendor :-(<br /><br />Thanks for your input though Fun Roulette, very helpful :-)

				Yes a GOOD writer&#039;s services would be of value. Just make sure you don&#039;t list your services to cheap on the market, that&#039;s the easiest way to seem like an ammature. Also, seeing is believing, so a sample maybe?

				Thanks fishfaced<br /><br />When you say maybe... what would you make your judgement on?<br /><br />Do you mean if the freelancer had a good track record on SR? Or do you mean if you had an illegal request that you couldn&#039;t really go to odesk for? And if the latter, would you then not consider hiring through SR for perfectly legal projects?<br /><br />Just probing :-)

				I might consider it. I might consider doing it too. I am registered for elance presently and have enough advanced degrees and writing experience I could see it being of use but I am not sure SR is the best place to market that service. *Shrug*<br /><br />On the other hand I very certainly would hire a Freebaser on SR...

But think about the types of businesses you have operating on SR... they are hardly likely to get away with hiring somebody to do work for them through Elance ;-) it&#039;s an untapped client reserve, providing you don&#039;t mind topics of questionable morality - and even then, it would be easy to pick and choose what you were willing to work with and what you weren&#039;t, based on your own values and codes rather than the law&#039;s.

				Yo dude, can you spin something unethical into something ethical?<br /><br />What I mean, is if I sent you a study I&#039;ve been working on which is technically unethical (don&#039;t worry, nobody was harmed during the making of this psychoanalysis), would you be able to reword the methodology to cloud the blurry ethics so they seemed less questionable, and more valiantly daring?<br /><br />TBH I might be best PMing you about this with more details.

				Seriously depends on the study dude. I&#039;m down with psychology, and I&#039;m down with &#039;spin&#039;... but I&#039;m not down with certain types of ethical breach. So it all depends on what your definition of &#039;unethical&#039; is - try me, we&#039;ll see. I&#039;m very open minded but I have my own personal guidelines of right and wrong.
