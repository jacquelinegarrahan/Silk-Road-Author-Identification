				Dear readers,<br />for my personal experience the most trusted vendor for hash on SR is definitely EMERALD(99)<br />my order was confirmed on thursday and arrived on monday(EU), very good communication.<br />quality is no doubt a 5/5, very resinous, soft at room temperature, and really nice bubbles when heated.<br />The flavor and high are also really strong, gives a nice social buzz but use wisely or you just going to be <br />damn stoned for a few hours;-)<br />packaging wasn´t the best i´ve seen but the product itself was very well sealed and in addition to that also vacuum packed, can´t imagine they would detect it...<br />overall 5/5, emerald´s a great vendor:)!!

				Hi if your willing to post some feedback and spread the word I would be more than happy to send you a sample of our Hash (I am assuming you are not in the USA).&nbsp; This stuff is full melt bubble, super tasty, and wonderful.<br /><br />Other members are just starting to see samples of our hash, you can check out our feedback here:<br />dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151559.0
