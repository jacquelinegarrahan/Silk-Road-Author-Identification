				Anyone else out there enjoy eating raw hash? I had some from decades ago that I found and started eating. Minute, pinhead-sized quantities of it work really well to give me a smooth high for many hours. Got ahold of some more recently and have been doing the same thing. I have no doubt that there are more efficient ways of ingesting this, but... this method is easy and it works.<br /><br />Anyone else doing this? Anyone think I&#039;m *really* wasting the stuff by trying to just ingest it? I find that it hits me better if I crumble it up as fine as possible.. the more powdery I make it, the better.

				If it works for you who gives a rats ass what anyone else thinks ! But you&#039;re going to get my 2 cents worth now anyway lol I personally crumble mine on to a spoon with a small amount of oil then mix it in a yoghurt, eating it gives me a deeper stone then smoking it but I do both just to make sure :)

I was asking so as to perhaps refine my methods. Sounds like the crumbling is a key component of success here. ;)

				I tried this once and it didn&#039;t work. Does it have to be a certain kind of hash?
