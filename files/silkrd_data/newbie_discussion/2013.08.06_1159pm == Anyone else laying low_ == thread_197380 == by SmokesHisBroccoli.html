				I think I&#039;m going to lay low and see how all this freedom hosting/ tormail security breach stuff plays out.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the position of being unsure if I was exposed to the exploit and that&#039;s mainly due to the timing.&nbsp; Even if I did meet all the technical criteria like having windows and the outdated TBB nobody can say for sure when the exploit surfaced.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been on tormail for sometime.&nbsp; That&#039;s good because I probably wasn&#039;t exposed.&nbsp; But bad because it&#039;s been too long for me to remember what the hell I left in my inbox.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, anyone else laying low for now?&nbsp; Or is it business as usual for you?&nbsp;

				If you&#039;re not sure whether you were exposed, the good news is that it will take LE months to years to sift through all the data on the Freedom Hosting server(s), and they will go after the biggest targets first, like major CP distributors and drug vendors who can be connected to the content of their emails. If you are a buyer, they probably won&#039;t go after you, but even if they did, you have a long time to wipe your hard drive and start fresh.

				SmokesHisBroccoli- just mind you P&#039;s and Q&#039;s my friend and stay safe....LE is most likely after those Pedo pricks that distribute mass cheese pizza...again they&#039;re after big targets because they do not have the funds nor resources to knit everybody, but in the mean time just tread lightly and keep your eyes on the news and updates around here...<br /><br /><br />Mr.Black

				Thanks guys I hope you stay safe yourselves.&nbsp; I guess I shouldn&#039;t be worrying too much because it never does me any good anyways and I probably don&#039;t have much to worry about.&nbsp; I never conducted business through tormail.&nbsp; Never sent or received an address.&nbsp; NEVER involved in CP which I agree is a disgusting thing.&nbsp; Plus like tanamon mentioned small timers don&#039;t have to worry as much as the big players.&nbsp; And I&#039;m about as small time as they come.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only thing I am worried about is them being able to trace bitcoin purchases to me.&nbsp; I pray that the SR tumbler does a damn fine job of washing the bitcoins.&nbsp; I understand it does from what I&#039;ve gathered on here.&nbsp; In the future I&#039;m going to be more diligent in washing my coins though.&nbsp;

				i think what people should be fearful of is whether or not, and if so, how many, vendors kept their customer information easily accessible within tormail.<br /><br />can you imagine your drop or personal address showing up multiple times to the FBI as they&#039;re going through all the emails?&nbsp; and what if one those vendors, unbeknownst to you, is also messed up with kiddie smut?&nbsp; how fucked are you now?<br /><br />then the &quot;oh, they wouldn&#039;t be concerned with just a small time user&quot; rationale doesn&#039;t seem so applicable.
