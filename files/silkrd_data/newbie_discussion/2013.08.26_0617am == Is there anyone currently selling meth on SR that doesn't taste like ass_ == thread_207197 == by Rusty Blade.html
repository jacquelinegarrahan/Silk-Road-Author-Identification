				All my previous go to meth vendors either went dark after the tormail infiltration or haven&#039;t been listing very much in the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; I tried a different domestic vendor (in the US fuckin&#039; A, of course!) with what seemed like decent feedback but the shit smelled and tasted nasty and was not very strong at all.&nbsp; Anyone else had better luck recently?&nbsp; I don&#039;t mind ordering from overseas as long as the product is clean and gets the job done.&nbsp; Thanks in advance, my homesqueezes.<br /><br />P.S. If you bought any of that blue shit that&#039;s currently listed I don&#039;t give a flying fuck what your opinion is and please do not reproduce because the world already has more than enough stupid to go around, you dumb fucking bitches.&nbsp; Peace.

				I placed an order with ChiTownMafia last night, but I have never tried meth before. I&#039;m going to be railing it. Anyone know the oral availability vs insulffulating meth? And reccomended starting doses? I was thinking about 20mg to start. I will reply to thread when I&#039;ve tried it, although I won&#039;t be able to let you know on quality since I have never tried it myself, I HAVE tried mdma, methylone, nearly every opiate, all of which many many times, so I can compare the taste/burn to those.

				Be careful going as high as 20mg with no tolerance and as a new user. Assume you could be doing 20mg of real meth (unlikely, as there will be some cut), but better safe than sorry. 20 will hit you like a freight train and not let up for many hours. You might want to have some benzos around you are familiar with. Don&#039;t do it in the evening if you planned to sleep. I&#039;d recommend 5-10, probably closer to 5 if your scale is accurate enough. Or divide that 20 into 4 piles. Do 5, wait an hour and then decide if you want to do more. I remember one time I was coming off a break, got some primo product from godofall, and an 8mg line lasted me 8 hours at least.<br /><br />As to who is the best? I&#039;d have to vote for purest right now. Still waiting on ChiTown but from all accounts he is also good!

				The Dope Spot is also good and the ice got me awesomely high for a loooong time so I&#039;m sure its good too. It smoked good (and tasted and smelled of chemicals, maybe just because it is a strong one, I haven&#039;t tried others), and it recrystalized all over the glass but my favorite was railing it and eating it, when that came on it was so much better, long lasting plateau and buzzing hard. It was nice.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have exp with any other ice vendors, but the trans with TDS was beyond satisfactory for me.

				How would you compare a 20mg meth dose railed, to a 120mg adderall dose or 280mg vyvanse dose? I&#039;ve taken doses as high as those before on many occasions, not the greatest idea, but it was incredible. I did take safety precautions such as multi vitamins, and staying extra hydrated. Also how does the vasoconstriction compare? I get some mad stim dick on huge doses of addy/vyv. Needless to say, I wana fuck on meth, i hear it&#039;s amazing but not sure if you can get stim dick, as it is such a low dose (But also potent, which makes me even more unsure, plus the fact that i have never tried it before).

				I guess you would have to skate and see for yourself if you get similar effects. The dosages are smaller for crystal, because it is stronger. I feel it is similar in some ways to other drugs too.<br /><br />All I know is it lasts a long time and had me feeling good.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t care less if I had sex or not when being so high is better than sex.<br /><br />

				Thanks for all of the replies.<br /><br />No I did not try the blue stuff.&nbsp; I figured that any vendor trying to pawn that off as legitimate can&#039;t possibly be trusted with my coins.<br /><br />I thought the goods from purest were mediocre so maybe I&#039;ll give the Dope Spot a try.&nbsp; Thanks again everyone.
