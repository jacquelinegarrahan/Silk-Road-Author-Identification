				Ordered from a reputable vendor last Friday and was shipped the same day. Tracking info shows that the package was out for delivery on Tuesday, but the package never showed (it is just saying &quot;delivery status not updated&quot;). It&#039;s Friday now and still nothing. What kind of recourse do I have here? Accept it as a loss? Was it confiscated or just lost somewhere? <br /><br />Not sure what to do here. I&#039;ve never had any issues getting orders shipped here. Any help? Also expecting another package that I am worried about now.

				well that is weird that it made it to your local post office to be scanned but not to your house.<br />your only option is to phone the post office. its a gamble<br />it might be nothing<br />was it international and was it small or big?<br />have you got this from this vendor before so you have an idea of how good his packaging is? like i have had vendors i would have no problem phoning the post office cause i know no one would find it

				Ordered from this vendor multiple times and always small, personal quantitites (weed and edibles). I only order domestic (US). Stealth is good, but if opened you could easily tell what it is after ripping through the vaccum seal. <br /><br />I also noticed that I had a new postal carrier this week. Young kid...hope he&#039;s not messing with my mail.

				yah i doubt this is a seized package. if you dont feel your address has been flagged and you feel comfortable with the vendors packaging, i dont see how it would make it all the way to your local post office, get scanned for delivery and then vanish. i would think it was more likely the new dude. maybe he stole it. <br />if it is just a small amount of weed, i would phone the post office, where i live its a small fine for possession, not sure if its a larger problem if it involves the mail. probably. if there is a chance you feel you could face legal trouble i wouldnt risk it for a small amount of weed. not worth it. but if you dont think LE is involved or the penalty isnt very severe i would go for it<br />this really is wish washy advice lol sorry, this is a hard one

				No worries. Thanks for the advice...I will take any I can get at this point. I don&#039;t think it has been seized either...kinda leaning towards the carrier snatching it up. I&#039;m not a violent person, but thinking about that possiblity sends me into a rage. <br />
