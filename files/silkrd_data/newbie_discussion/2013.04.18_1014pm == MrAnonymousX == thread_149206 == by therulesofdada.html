				Ordered 2g of Mandy from him 24 days ago. Paid 0.7 BTC. Finalized early as requested by him. He said normal for him to do with first time buyer and would throw in a whole extra g for the trouble. 24 days later, still no product. He communicates well and seems genuine. His forum comments all make him out to be amazing, always throwing in extra gs. I don&#039;t want to think this way but I am getting concerned that he may be pulling a fast one. He seems to have got loads of people to FE and all still waiting for product.<br />Has anyone else had dealings? can anyone reassure me or otherwise<br />T

				Guys for the love of god DON&#039;t FINALIZE EARLY. no matter what they say they will throw in just don&#039;t do it. You will get scammed and ripped off by the boat load. I&#039;ve almost got 20 transactions and have never FE&#039;d and have always got what i ordered. DO NOT FE PLEASE.
