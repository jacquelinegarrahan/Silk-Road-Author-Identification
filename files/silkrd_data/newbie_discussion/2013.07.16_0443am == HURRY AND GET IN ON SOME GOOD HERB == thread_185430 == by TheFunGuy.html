				To avoid buyer confusion and disappointment, I feel that dog poop should have its own category listing.

				If you&#039;re posting on a worldwide market and you can&#039;t even be bothered to mention where you&#039;re posting from I can&#039;t be bothered to read your listings.<br /><br />Deal?

				ok rocknessie I know it&#039;s a bitch when you want to get some herb but you want it to be from a domestic vendor and they say &quot;undeclared&quot; as their country right? There are more than one way to skin a cat tho and one of them is not by being rude. It will hurt more than it helps my friend.<br /><br />If you insist on getting from this vendor but not without knowing the shipping from place then I suggest you start reading reviews and see if you can figure it out. Look at the people reviewing and read each one&#039;s post and you may be able to find out something<br /><br />It does not matter where someone is from but it matters if their customers are getting stuff in a timely fashion and maybe some of their customers are in a location somewhat in common with you<br /><br />Frankly getting on here and trying to find out where somebody is at is very frowned upon by the community so take it easy

They have their country listed on their profile (USA).&nbsp; <br /><br />They should have put it in the topic title to confine their reads to that country, rather than make everyone else in the world do that work for them.
