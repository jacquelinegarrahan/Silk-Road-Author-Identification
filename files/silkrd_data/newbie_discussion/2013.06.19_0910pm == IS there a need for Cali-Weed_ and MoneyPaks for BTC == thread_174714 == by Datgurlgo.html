				Greetings,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been perusing the site for the last couple of days and must admit I like what I see.&nbsp; However, I was lead here with interest of becoming a Cali-grown Marijuana vendor, but I see a ton of Vendors in that arena already.&nbsp; I am 100% sure that I my product will speak for itself so I fully plan on letting it with free samples.&nbsp; My question is can SR use another Marijuana vendor? I also want to sell MoneyPaks as well.&nbsp; Too me this seems like a no brainer, unless the customer reports they never received that reload number.&nbsp; Im just a curious future vendor trying to learn the ropes a little before I jump in.

				Oh, I forgot to say what&nbsp; strand its GDP ( Granddaddy Purp) and Bubba Kush.&nbsp; Also please dont send me a private message inquiring about samples.&nbsp; Samples will be made available on Monday.&nbsp; As being new to the BTC world I went to coin base and its taking them a week to load the money... so in the meantime I thought Id make some future consumers.&nbsp; I will also not take any order request until I get an established vendor page so dont PM me inquiring.&nbsp; To keep me and you safe lets just play by the rules.&nbsp;

				There&#039;s a lot of marijuana vendors for sure, but any vendor who can deliver excellent product fast, with good customer service and extreme stealth, well I can&#039;t see why s/he can&#039;t succeed.<br /><br />How&#039;s your marijuana raised? I&#039;m always on the lookout for organically raised / no synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or hormones / (preferably no pesticides but at least OMRI listed if they are necessary) or Clean Green Certified varieties in 1/2 oz lots.

				That sounds extremely plausible and doable.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your reputation is fully based on your service and product then that Im beyond ready to jump in.&nbsp; Our grass is grown organically and no we don&#039;t use pesticides.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Ps.&nbsp; what is this 50 post spam thing talking about????

It sounds nice. Is it indoor/outdoor? Is it grown in soil/coir, or is it hydro?<br /><br />The 50 post thing is what you have to have before you can post in any other forum than the newbie forum. So lots of users just make 50 garbage fast posts to get past that restriction. Hence the &#039;spam your way to 50&#039; threads.<br /><br />Will be looking forward to the sample offerings. People will jump on that like crazy. Usually I wait until I see some buyer feedback on the stealth before jumping in.<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re ready with the stealth, using at least one mylar bag in the layering (and not just PE vacuum bags even if there are three layers).

				yes dear, like I said Ive been perusing for days.&nbsp; I have my stealth is ready to go.&nbsp; I just shouldnt have went through coinbase my vendor page would have already been purchased.&nbsp; But I guess I should use this time to catch up on post so when I do get my vendor page I can post multiple threads advertising.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Indoor/hydro grow
