				So when breaking up the rocks of molly and trying to preserve chunks, do you use a razor blade to break it down to weigh and cap? Just curious seeing that I&#039;ve never seen or heard of how people are doing it while avoiding turning it into a lot of powder.<br /><br />Don&#039;t some people cut it with baby formula as well? hence why rocks are more appealing to the eyes knowing it isnt cut

				&nbsp;Yea rocks can be more appealing , pending on your clientele base and just how much they trust you. Though more often than not, at a street level 8/10 caps you see with nice white/off white or tan rocks in them, are not MDMA at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;If your looking to break down big rocks into smaller ones for more accurate weighing, just bust that shit up. I dont know how big of chucks yourr trying to break but w.e the case, just double bag them and bang it on a hard surface a few times, or just give it a few taps with something. Almost anything will work, i usually use a spoon though. <br /><br />&nbsp;Personally i had to do this with large amounts of coke, so i dont actually know exactly how a 10+ gram of MDMA will break when hit but if it just seems to be producing sand when you tap it I would grab a flat screw driver, or an ice pick if you have one available to you put it to the rock and tap that with the spoon. As if to chisel. <br /><br />&nbsp;Ive never heard of some one cutting MDMA with baby formula, but that certainly dont mean that it doesnt happen.&nbsp;
