				Why can&#039;t I post a new topic in Requests...?<br /><br />I have a new topic that I want to post in the Requests section... Is there some kind of number of posts I need to have before being allowed to post? I have no idea why I can&#039;t post a new topic in there....

				Yes, until you have 50 posts you will only be able to post here and the Customer Support section.

				OK, let me just say, that&#039;s a very poor law on the forum.. If people were spamming in Requests, mods could just delete the posts..<br /><br />And now.. in order for me to get to 50 posts... I will basically, well, I don&#039;t even have 50 things to say.... So... If I even want to post in there, I&#039;ll just have to fill up this forum with junk...<br /><br />See what I&#039;m saying..?? Like.. it&#039;s a silly rule.. can someone please go to the mods and change it..? Can the mods/admins please change this stupid 50 post rule? It is a stupid, stupid, stupid rule.

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s stupid, it was put in place to slow the spammers. At one point it was frustrating to find every board full of their BTC scaming posts. Go look. :)<br /><br />

				I understand your frustration but, surely you would rather be restricted and read any important information than have the boards filled with spam?

				I&#039;d say it&#039;s working. They spammed here a little while ago. Slid off into oblivion rather quickly.

				No. It&#039;s s stupid rule, because they could just as easily spam this board<br /><br />I mean, let me ask the people in this thread, then... What should I do now, because I really want to post a request in the Requests section.. Should I just fill up this forum with junk, or should I post the request in another section, like, say, this very section..?

				You should post your request here first, because you can.<br /><br />On some furums, turbo posting is not allowed. The mods would delete turbo post threads and there goes your count.<br /><br />They don&#039;t seem to do that here.<br /><br />
