				3 if you count me giving thurgood 1700$, I know that isn&#039;t a lot. But I am straight desperate. Also i have been thinking about becoming a vendor for dilaudid 8 if that would help my credibility. I know its just my word but I lost a decent amount of money from the thurgood situation and I am putting my self thru college with this. No job, no help from mommy and daddy. Obviously i will pay out. I just want some one who lives by the same rules I do and has a some respect to the honor code.

				The advice from DPR (and its very good advice) is if you&#039;re new, to start off small.&nbsp; You&#039;re new to SR and you&#039;re trying to buy bulk?&nbsp; Try buying personal amounts of less than an ounce from different vendors.&nbsp; Once you figure out who you like dealing with, then deal with them.

				I went with thurgood for a reason. Everybody swore by him. Im guessing I was just caught up in a &quot;shiticane&quot; as Jim Laehey would say. What I&#039;m gathering is that because I have only made a couple of small purchases I wont be trusted by vendors who won&quot;&#039;t require me to FE? Pretty much every vendor I have seen seen requires FE for bulk. I could easily clear 2-3 lbs a week in my current situation but because I live in a shitty place i can only acquire hps at a fairly high price. Taking another L like that would ruin me and my crew.

				I guess im just going to have to take my time. Like I said every one swore by Thurgood. But I guess just like in real life you can get a gun put to your dome on here they just take your money without the threat of death. I appreciate the advice. My main thing is the threat of another thurgood and what would prevent it. I consider my self a CEO with a business to run.

				def. keep looking man dont FE your just going to get burned, i dont care who the vendor is or what their ratings are the vendors ARE NOT your friends and u need to trust them that way as well, ...ask yourself this would you give somebody you never met your money in hopes they will give you something in return without every meeting you face to face and have no real contact outside this SR world, so my advice dont do it i know alot of people over the last week who have gotten burned by vendors with great reps and no problems but its cause to much trust is given by some so stay away from that but aside with the karma thing you need to hit 100 posts first before you can give someone positive or negative karma, good luck man and i hope you find the vendor that fits your needs....they are out there keep searching.....check out Kushworld too they have been working with newer buyers

				I&#039;ve been on SR for a couple months now, but I just started posting.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried a whole bunch of sellers and had mostly good experiences. <br /><br />These are the ones I&#039;d recommend ( * = Top Picks)<br /><br />ogbryan*<br />NorCalChronic<br />WeedGirls<br />Pineapple69<br />Whichdoctor*<br />NorCalKing<br />GaiaGarden<br />BestPricePills<br />MedicalAccess4All<br />XXXotica<br /><br />That&#039;s really just a starter list, but those are the ones I&#039;d go back to first.<br /><br />Good luck<br />

				I&#039;ve only made 3 purchases so far from 3 different vendors, and 2 out of the 3 currently don&#039;t have any listings.&nbsp; My first vendor has been inactive for a while now, and I&#039;m wondering if he&#039;ll ever come back.&nbsp; The other vendor who still has current listings has good product and a very efficient operation, but the last few times I checked they only had one variety of cannabis for sale, and I don&#039;t care for that strain.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m relatively new here, but vendors seem to come and go.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done my research on the forums here, and some of the discussion threads that I&#039;ve bookmarked talk about a number of good vendors, some of which whenever I check their pages, don&#039;t have any current listings.&nbsp; It could be they&#039;re having downtime or they have their own dedicated client base who buys up their offerings as soon as it becomes available.
