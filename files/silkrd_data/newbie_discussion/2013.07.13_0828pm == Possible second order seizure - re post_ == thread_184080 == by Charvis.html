				Basically I made my first SR order at the same time as another one. One order was 5g of Bud and another was a spliff, both domestic and from Vendors with high reputation. My first roder of bud became &#039;In Transit&#039; faster than the spliff and was expected to arrive on Wednesday ( First Class). It didnt come but my spliff did and it was very nice. Its now Saturday and it hasn turned up at all, but I&#039;ve had no phone calls or letters form the Royal Mail about a seizure or anything so im a bit confused.The vendor has agreed to resend the package and is expected to arrive on tuesday.<br /><br />do you think my package was seized, and if so will they seize this repost?. The vendo ris legit he has tons of reviews per hour, and I&#039;m quite worried they migth have flagged my address or sonething? If so will another order of 5g give them reason to come snooping round or something?<br /><br />Thanks.

				Domestic, my gut feeling would be something has gone wrong and its not likely to have been seized.<br /><br />Odds on your VERY first domestic order getting seized would be very VERY low.<br /><br />Assuming its addressed to an address and occupant that is at that address and no fuck up were made, then either stealth was awful or it wasn&#039;t sent/ sent incorrectly.<br /><br />There is that 0.1% chance, but on domestic it would only be if its falling out or stinks and I&#039;d just pressure the vendor to go the extra mile for the reship, even if you have to pay extra.

				The vendor said he&#039;d ship it out again and that he has improved the stealth. Hopefully it should arrive on Tuesday I&#039;ll keep you guys updated.<br /><br />
