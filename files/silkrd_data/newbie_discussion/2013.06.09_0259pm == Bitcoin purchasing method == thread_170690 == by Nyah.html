				I&#039;m looking for a Bitcoin purchasing method that utilizes Debit/Credit card payments, &amp; doesn&#039;t require bank wiring.<br /><br />But before you go suggesting every exchanger under the sun, I&#039;ve been using Silkroad for quite a long time.<br />My previous method of purchasing Bitcoins was via credit card @ centregold.com to Liberty Reserve. Then using AurumXchange, I transferred the funds from Liberty Reserve to MtGox, Then straight to my Silkroad coin address.<br /><br />However, As I&#039;m sure everybody noticed Liberty Reserves domain has been seized by the US government. <br />So i tried i new method, Centregold to pecunix.com.Problem is, AurumXchange is never in demand for Pecunix funds and disable it as an option for the most part.<br /><br />So i tried transferring from Pecunix to Wm-center, And boy was that a mistake (Seized by the US government roughly a week ago, Whilst holding $300 dollars worth of my funds)<br /><br />Anyone care to recommend a less strenuous method of purchasing coins? Or at least a simpler way to fund Mtgox. <br />It also shouldn&#039;t take longer than 1 business day to process funds, I&#039;m not keen on losing another stack of cash to a site that could be seized within ludicrously long process periods.<br /><br />

				What do you do if the closest person is ~5 hour drive away? I used to use bitinstant with zipzap to BTC address, but that option seems to have been taken down...

Should be fine with that, Anythings better than an exchange site having your details.

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
