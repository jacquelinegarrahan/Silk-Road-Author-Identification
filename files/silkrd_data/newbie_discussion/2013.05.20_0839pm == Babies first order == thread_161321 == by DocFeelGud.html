				Just made my first order with catfish 916, but can&#039;t finalize. It says in Wiki the button should be next to the order. Any thoughts? I know I shouldn&#039;t FE, and I don&#039;t intend to in the future, but for such a small order with such a reputable tender, I&#039;ll make the exception. Where is the finalize button??<br />Help a comrade out. Thanks guys<br />~DocFeelGud~

				You can only Finalize once the order has been marked &quot;in transit&quot;. If the vendor isn&#039;t asking you to, don&#039;t. you will have no protection from SR if anything unexpected happens.

				He did specifically request it; it&#039;s the only way he takes orders. Kind of sketch but he&#039;s very reputable;e and I said the order is small enough that I think it should be alright. No button next to the order, but he explicitly says in his profile it will only ship once you have FE&#039;d, so perhaps he does need to confirm it first?? Otherwise, that wouldn&#039;t make any sense. Any thoughts? Keep in mind this is my first order, so perhaps that plays some role . . .

				So does everyone here believe that no matter how much positive feed back a vendor that requires FE has, a customer should still not do business with him? I won&#039;t lie, I&#039;m nervous about the idea, but do positive reviews not play a factor at all? There&#039;s a vendor on here who sells large quantities of MDMA, who&#039;s bulk orders are exclusively FE. his feedback is nearly pristine and he is ranked I believe in the top 2%. Should people still not trade with him due to his policy??

If a package is sent with tracking i dont see the need for a vendor to FE ever. <br />its really up to you and whether or not you want to risk loosing your money. not saying its going to happen but it could and you won&#039;t have the support of the SR staff.

				im not trying to say that any particular vendor your working with is bad or a scammer. but as a whole we all need to try and never FE, there have even been vendors with good ratings who have decided to close up shop and require a lot of people to FE on a lot of big purchases, then take off with the money for one last haul/retirement fund. I figure if everyone refuses to FE then the scammers will never get a single bitcent and eventually move on to other endeavors, its just better for the community as a whole if we all refuse to FE.
