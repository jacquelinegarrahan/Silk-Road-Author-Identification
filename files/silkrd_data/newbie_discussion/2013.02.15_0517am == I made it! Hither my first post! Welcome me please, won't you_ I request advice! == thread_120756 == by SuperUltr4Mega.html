				This is interesting. I read about this place in an article I think out of Rolling Stone. It was a small, almost unnoticeable article, for the best im sure. I don&#039;t mean to add, as myself, being, to the ever increasing decadence of such a place. hmm well there is no stopping it. I&#039;m sure everyone especially long term users are most aware, this place will disappear one day, really only to evolve into something more discreet and for only certain elite. <br /><br />ANYWAY....nuf of that. So I just got a job and will have to wait a few checks before I invest into any bitcoins. The current rate is approx 27per which is omni-ridiculous or perhaps not quite omni cause I&#039;m willing to tolerate that but if it gets much further from $25 per like past $33 per man idk thats just my imagined threshold. Do you think it&#039;ll get that high or higher consistently or is this something that fluxuates more or less around a certain average? or do we even know? this being such a new frontier. shit. <br /><br />hopefully 2 or 3 checks from now its wont be so bad. thats like at least 2months from now before I can consider my first purchase. I&#039;m looking hard in the vendor review threads over at rumor mill. As the time gets closer I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll shoot many more questions cause I will want to be very involved, especially as a nub, with my transaction. <br /><br />So I have some important questions. If these are already covered in sticky&#039;s or something feel free to forgive me and direct me. <br /><br />So I felt like it was all kind of too ease. Downloading the browser I mean and well you know, registering and getting on to the road and everything. so easy. And before I went ahead with the dl and install I read so much about relaying and pgping two things which I know nothing about. So ya I browsed the road perfectly without this so called relaying or pgping whatever those are. So just how safe am I making a purchase with just the browser and being on the road? should I also be using some other techniques like the above or even others? Or am I pretty much ok for the most part? <br /><br />Aside from that main question which is most important to me, I hope the uhh experienced guys n gals here wont be sighing and rolling their eyes too far into the back of their heads at my ignorance. I don&#039;t mean to be yet another spec of fuzz to the heat generated by the sprawling publicity this thing is causing. Though even you pro&#039;s should imagine something like that was inevitable. I mean I&#039;m not even going to ask how the secret got out. <br /><br />Just want you to know I plan to have positively honest and solid SR credit once I&#039;m there and hope to maintain the right relationships via these forums. okay.
