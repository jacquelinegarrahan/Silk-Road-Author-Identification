				With finesse, you can also vaporize it in a glass pipe. Dab the oil in, hold the lighter close until it bubbles, and stop lighting pretty shortly after. You should see vapor rising off the oil, hopefully in thick and long-lasting wisps. Inhale either through the pipe or directly above the wisps. This isn&#039;t an efficient way to hit dabs, maybe as efficient as combining it with weed or tobacco, but if you have enough to be a little wasteful and need to get high with what you got, then it works.

It is also a little more wasteful, a little goes a very long way with hash oil so be prepared to share a cigarette smeared in it. It&#039;s called a &#039;dab&#039; because all you need is a dab- about the size of a match head at most should get you very toasty. Maybe you have a big tolerance and need a little more, you know yourself best. It&#039;s also a very clear-headed high, so you won&#039;t get too deep into Psychotic Hour that too much weed will bring you.

				Yep! The THC does not need to be extracted into butter as it has already been extracted, so you can use it in any cooking.

				I would think to cook with hash oil you would still be much better off extracting or at least mixing with some kind of cooking oil. I&#039;ve heard a lot about eating the reclaim from an oil piece though, as it&#039;s essentially decarb&#039;ed thc that&#039;s already orally active. <br /><br />My vote for smoking hash oil is the titanium nail + GonG dome + GonG adapter to use with you favorite bong!<br /><br />I just found a good deal on the micro G pen set. Wax/Oil pens are really awesome too.

Sounds like it would ruin the oil. Try packing a bowl and then dripping some hash oil into it using a paper clip. Just get your dab on the paper clip and heat the metal with a lighter until it drips off.

				I&#039;ve used a titanium pad on an oil rig with great success, but I&#039;ve also read that butane extracted hash oil may be harmful because &#039;supposedly&#039; the chemical structure of the cannabinoids is changed by this process.&nbsp; But, I don&#039;t claim to be certain of this and as always, do your own research.

				&nbsp;Use a bed of ash in your bong/dry pipe and smoke like normal.&nbsp; People will think you are on crack when they see you saving your ash and making sure no bits of tobacco/weed go in it, but that&#039;s the price you pay for easy oil smoking.

				That sounds awesome!<br />Do people know what i mean by wire wool, used for smoking crack/heroin? Come to think of it, the oil would probably seep through to the bottom as it&#039;s not a rock/powder.

				A basic oil rig (meaning a glass piece with a 14 or 18 direct inject joint on it) can be found at your local head shop or online for pretty cheap or you can just go online and buy a vape pen (mini vaporizers for oil) for pretty cheap. I prefer titanium nails over glass nails because they heat quicker too....yeah dont use that wire wool it will waste all your oil btw.

				Referring to the method of putting a dab on a bed of ash and smoking it in a bong, is the idea to keep the flame at a distance from the oil, so it bubbles and gives off smoke/vapour to inhale? Or do you just wade in and burn it, like with weed or hash?<br />I know vape pens are the best way to go, but a bong is all I have at the moment.

				My favorite way to smoke oils is by dabbing it with the bong dabber.&nbsp; Its a glass or titanium nail that sticks out of the downstem.&nbsp; You heat up the nail, and then place a glass dome over it, and then placing a pick with oils onto the nail.&nbsp; Its just like a regular bong rip, but more chrondidilionic.

				The best is a nail/fishbowl setup for your bong. Get a butane torch to heat your nail, slide the globe over the nail, and drop your dab. This is going to be the most bang for your buck with oil.<br /><br />If you have some oil but no equipment then you are going to want to hot-knife it. 2 butter knives required. Heat one knife on the stove, dab goes on the other one. Press together over a bong stem and draw in the smoke. More wasteful then dabs, but at least you have the tools in your standard kitchen.<br /><br />Most wasteful is to just drip some onto a bud, ash, whatever, or smear it on a rolling paper. It will certainly work, but not as well.

				Thanks everyone! ;D<br />Just to confirm though, if I smoke it in a bong, putting a dab on some ash, do I just burn it with a lighter and inhale the smoke? Or do you keep the flame at a distance, so the oil bubbles and gives off vapor? I know this is wasteful, but it&#039;s the way i&#039;m gonna start off with anyhow.<br />Also, is it true that oil is more dangerous than other forms of cannabis? Had never heard about this till recently. Anyone know the score? Isn&#039;t oil a class A drug in UK, while weed/hash is class B?
