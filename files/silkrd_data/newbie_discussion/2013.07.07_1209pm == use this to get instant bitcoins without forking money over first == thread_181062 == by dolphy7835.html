				It&#039;s called localbitcoins.com. pretty simple. People in your area post that they have btc to sell. You contact the seller and agree on a meet and greet. I recommend public place for obvious reasons. Just bring your cash and you will see the btc in your account instantly after the seller releases them. Instant even exchange. You would seriously have to be retarded to fuck it up and get duped. Make sure your guy\girl is local. Because of course there are spammers from all over the country advertising in your area. They also have an escrow system just like sr if you can&#039;t do the meet and greet.

				So, how exactly does the seller transfer your electronic bitcoins while you are in person, so that you ensure not to be scammed? I imagine it goes like this, but please help me understand if I&#039;m wrong:&nbsp; buyer and seller agree to meet, preferably in a public location. Buyer hands seller money. Seller ??? tranfers bitcoins to your wallet? you personally? electronically while you are there? Thanks.

				Exactly. You have to register with localbitcoins.com and you get a wallet. You meet seller, he transfers btc to your account which is seen by you and registers immediately in your wallet. Then you just pay the guy. There is a confirm transaction button that is like the finalization on sr. Then of course you transfer from your localbitcoins wallet to your sr wallet. It&#039;s really simple you&#039;ll find. Check it out and lemme know how it goes.

				Just tried creating account on localbitcoins.com but system won&#039;t allow it. Don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s because I&#039;m using TorBrowser. Don&#039;t wanna used Explorer.

				? That&#039;s strange. Don&#039;t know why. It&#039;s okay to se regular browser for the website since it&#039;s not illegal to buy bitcoins. R u in us? I don&#039;t know if it is us only based or if it is available internationally.

				Well that answers that. Sorry. Do you have anything like a local craigslist or even local forums in canada that you could try and reach out to someone locally?

				Just typed in moneypack on sr sites searchfield and there is one vendor on there that has moneypack for bitcoin listing. Haven&#039;t dealt with her personally, but it would be protected by escrow, and person to person btc transfer is instant in my experience. You should check it out. If you have any questions message the vendor. And whatever you do, don&#039;t finalize early.

				I went back to get a second look and if you click on the money category there are several vendors i see offering the moneypack for btc service. Also spelled it moneypak without a c and got more results.

				localbitcoins has been great for keeping it anonymous [cash deposits in btc seller bank accounts]. I just realized that ebay is another option, although the prices are CRAZY.<br /><br />I also like to keep an eye on localbitcoins as a market indicator. if the lower prices start to dry up, then its a sign that demand and volume are pushing a bit.

				Used localbitcoins for my last buy. So easy and seamless! Met in a crowded starbucks, we both had our phones, he showed me the money was released and I gave him the cash. <br /><br />Wham bam thank you mam. No waiting. I would definitely reccommend, just definitely get a reputable vendor obviously.

				I would imagine LE is using local bitcoins as a means to test their tracking ability. 1) They know your initial wallet, although only your identity by face, but that&#039;s becoming easier and easier to match using facial recognition. 2) Knowing you and your wallet, they can now attempt to track every transaction. Just my 2btc.

				Definitely some logic in that. Seems like too much of a waste of manpower though. If you think about all the processes involved in it being run by le, i just don&#039;t see them doing that. At least not for us buyers anyway. Vendors, maybe. But you never can tell with our government&#039;s capabilities today. I&#039;m just a small-time buyer. I don&#039;t buy bulk, so i&#039;m as concerned about little ole me getting set-up.I wonder how secure these forums really are, because when you look at the bottom of the homepage it tells you how many users there are online and even the number of protected and un-protected users as well as a list of users who have been on in the last fifteen minutes. How fucking anonymous is that?
