				Been a SR member for over a year but never registered on forums i am familiar with stealth techniques up to a couple ounces.&nbsp; But i need to get atleast 4lb of some dank shipped to myself. <br /><br />I was curious if anyone had experience with this and recommended breaking it up into half pounds?<br /><br />As of now i only have 1 address i can receive with. I was thinking standard vaccum seal 3x in mylar bag -- 3 packages<br /><br /><br />2lb package goes out on saturday priority mail-<br />1lb package goes out on monday priority mail--<br />1lb package goes out on wed priority mail -- <br /><br />Then i would pick everything up on the following friday/saturday.<br /><br />I have a UPS store that collects packages for me for 3.00/package. They know me by face/name(not real)<br /><br />of course all the packages would be sent priority mail with a fake return address (close proximity of shipping point but different within 20 miles)<br /><br />the alternative was to drive it but i think the mail is safer and cheaper<br /><br />ive done smaller weights enough times that i trust my stealth to sign for it -- but never this amount of weight. thoughts?<br /><br />

				How far of a drive are you talking about? SF to NYC, i could understand not wanting to drive that, but if its just a few states over, i wouldn&#039;t risk mailing it.

				Just package your stuff in a box as if you were shipping it, and then drive it...&nbsp; Why add so many unknown variable to the equation?<br /><br />Just don&#039;t crash your car, have a bag of clothing etc packed, and have a good reason for traveling.&nbsp; Unless you are stupid and told others IRL about your plan (which opens you up to a snitch), the only thing that could fuck you is dumb luck - ala, crashing your car and having a box torn open.&nbsp; I&#039;d take those odds over having a package handled by an unknown number of people at unknown locations for an unknown amount of time...

				I know people who regularly ship 10 to 20 pounds per package without moisture barrier bags within the US without a problem.&nbsp; They only vacuum seal multiple times.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see you having any problem with your small lightweight packages.

				I would just drive it while obeying all the traffic rules so you don&#039;t get pulled over either. Don&#039;t speed. Don&#039;t cut people off. Don&#039;t do anything stupid. Just put some music on, sit back, and enjoy the ride. If you do get pulled over just remain calm. Distract yourself from the fact that you have 4 pounds in the trunk. Occupy your mind with the whereabouts of your license and registration or what you could have possibly done wrong to get pulled over. Hope this helps. Good luck.

If LE asks you if they can search your vehicle then you say: &quot;I do not consent to a search of my vehicle&quot;. Repeat that every time they come up with some reason or threat of what might happen if you don&#039;t. If they keep stalling you with bullshit ask them &quot;Am I free to go?&quot; Those are the only two sentences that should come out of your pie hole.<br /><br />They have to have a reason for searching your car. They can even threaten to bring the sniffing dogs but if your packaging is vacuum sealed enough then the dogs won&#039;t pick it up. Too often people get busted because they think they have to allow LE to search the car. It is not true; don&#039;t be foolish. They will try every trick in the book to get your consent.

				dont worry about a thing. just set your deniability up properly then relax. as we all know deny deny deny in case of emergency domestic you dont need to worry mate, I do feel SR and similar sites are a head of the game at the moment. The police just dont have the funding or time to move quickly enough without a lot of planning. Just be ready for the worst case scenario which is probably just losing money.
