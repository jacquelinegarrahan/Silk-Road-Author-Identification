				Is it worth holding off buying until 420? I heard many vendors set up some pretty good deals around that time, but I haven&#039;t been around long enough to see it myself :)

				I&#039;m crossing my fingers! Hopefully, they&#039;ll take into consideration that it takes a few days to get the supply. The sales shouldn&#039;t be ON 420, but the week before!!!! That way we can all get high together on 420!!!!!<br /><br />Please, dealers... put your sales up in the next few days! It will help out the AFK community on the day of celebration.<br /><br />Everyone also take a moment to honor the students of Columbine. That took place on 420, which fucking killed my buzz the day it happened. Share a joint, not your hatred. Don&#039;t bully kids. Don&#039;t support abuse. Don&#039;t support terrorism. Buy domestic. By local.<br />

				We will be doing a 4/20 sale which includes free edibles and BHO hash oil concentrates (Budder). We are already including free samples to all our customers since we&#039;re new and looking to become established here on Silkroad.<br /><br />Lookout for special promotions and sales items starting on the 18th. Till then you can STILL take advantage of superb pricing and service from your east coast suppliers (CannabisCrew)<br /><br />Good luck and best wishes!<br />-CC
