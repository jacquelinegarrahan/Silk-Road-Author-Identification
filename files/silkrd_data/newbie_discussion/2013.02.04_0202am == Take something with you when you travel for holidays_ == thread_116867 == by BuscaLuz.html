				Hi guys! <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I will go soon to Thailand for a month,and I was thinking to take some hash with me, as I am a regular smoker, do you think if I take like 10 gms hidden some how, will be OK? <br />Or I shall try to find something in there? (last time I went I just found some weed of very poor quality in to the beach of a small island and it was very expensive)<br /><br />Thanks for your help. and I hope someone can give me a hand with this.<br /><br />

				Not worth the risk. They are quite harsh about transportation in that part of the world. Plus do you need that stress when boarding a plane?<br />I would seek out something local when you got there.

				Asian countries have some of the harshest penalties for drug crimes in the world.&nbsp; Many of them won&#039;t even bother wasting money to lock you up.&nbsp; A bullet between the eyes is much cheaper.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to bring some kind of bud into the country, I would suggest some sort of concentrate.&nbsp; I think it&#039;d be much easier to attempt to conceal.&nbsp; I think the safest option is to abandon this idea.

				Thank you all for your answers, I will deserve of the idea, but I am gonna be mad 1 month without smoke, specially now,<br />&nbsp;that I start with Silk road. I try to do more meditation.<br /><br />And what about some hash brownies or cockies for the airplane?&nbsp; dogs will smell it? I departure from Amsterdam,so I assume they are full prepared, but for cakes as well??<br />Is because are 15 hours in to the plane!<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;d see a ten gram ball of hash rolled up right, wrapped in a condom, stuffed up your ass. But, in that country, they&#039;re going in after it. I&#039;ve crossed international lines carrying a little stuff, many times. Never a problem, even since 2001. But I don&#039;t travel to asia, only EU and the US.

				I would highly recommend not doing that.&nbsp; I have been to thailand a couple of times both tiimes for a month and loved it, and feel the same as you, I could happily live there, with the nice people, amazing food, great parties, great weather, and the low cost of everything.&nbsp; But all those things I just mentioned are what the tourists see.&nbsp; There is a very dark side to Thailand, and their drugs policy is extremely harsh.&nbsp; Just do some searching about it on google and you will see what I mean.&nbsp; I mean there are people who have never touched drugs get thrown in jail after mysteriously having drugs found in their suitcase without them having any idea how it got there, the police get money for busting people, its a corrupt country, and things get planted on people and their lives turn to hell for years due to their ridiculous justice system. <br /><br />So actively taking drugs with you is just too much of a risk to take.&nbsp; I mean you may well get through fine, but if you didnt and got caught it would be the biggest mistake of your life.&nbsp; People get huge sentences for the smallest amount of drugs being found on them.&nbsp; And if you want to know what their prisons are like, try reading a book called &#039;Send Them To Hell&#039; (it is an true account of a couple of guys who were slammed behind bars in Thailand for drugs) and you will realize nothing is worth spending time in one of those places!&nbsp; They are honestly hell on earth.<br /><br />I mean i love getting high on various substances, and quite regularly at that, and the last time I went I had a pretty large daily Ketamine habit, but to be honest when im in thailand i didnt even think about it.&nbsp; There is just so much to do there, and all the nice things you mentioned in your post there that I didnt think about it at all for the time I was out there, whereas in the UK up until the day I left I was doing a couple of g&#039;s at least a day. <br /><br />And if you do wanna get high, there are the mushroom shakes on koh pangang, plus probably other places, and there is a fair bit of weed about over there as well sold in certain bars, and the stuff i had wasnt bad at all, and wasnt too pricey, and opium is available if your into that, (its very nice you should give it a try, if you go on a 2 or 3 day jungle trek in chang mai your tour guide will take you to &#039;Doctor O&#039; in the hill tribes and you can smoke as much as you want, (plus the trek is awesome in itself, you get to do white water rafting, elephant riding and swim in the most beautiful waterfalls)). just dont get caught out of one of those bars in public or you will be in a very bad place, which will cost you a lot of money to get out of, and even then money may not get you out!<br /><br />I dont mean to sound condescending, but just saying I was someone who had a daily habit of doing a drug, and didnt take it with me (even though K could possibly be the easiest thing to smuggle ever by dissolving it in water and putting in luggage) and the stuff just didnt even cross my mind the whole time i was out there, so I am sure you wont go as nuts without having the smoke as much as you think you will, (and if you do, just go to one of the bars that sell it and smoke it there!)

				I agree with most of what everyone here is saying.<br /><br />Try to find stuff locally once you touch down.<br /><br />Some countries like Singapore and Indonesia will execute you and not give a damn what the U.S., or whatever your home country is, has to say about the death penalty handed down to you.<br /><br />That UK 59-year old lady is on death row, the government prosecutors didn&#039;t even ask for a death penalty and the judge was like &quot;Nope, she&#039;s dead.&quot;

				You&#039;d have to be crazy to take drugs with you on a plane. Perhaps there is a way for you to mail it so as to have it at your hotel or hostel before you&nbsp; get there. just keep your package as light and flat as possible, and vacuum seal it ofcourse. Oh and don&#039;t quote me, cause I don&#039;t know shit about this kindof thing.

				Jajajaja!!<br />&nbsp;You are awesome guys!<br /><br />I been once on Thailand and sure I found something! but I went with a friend, this time will be with my girlfriend who don&#039;t take any drugs and I don&#039;t want to involve her in this bussines.<br />I am this kind of persons who are not &quot;very lucky&quot;,so let me tell you my history, that is quiet funny (at least now after 8 years)<br /><br />So, there I was!! my friend and my at Thailand- Shiang Mai&nbsp; about 6 afternoon, and without sleep for 1 day and a half. Once there we went to meet a friend of us who was living there for 4 years, and She took us to the guest house,<br />we leave the bags there and then she bring us to a nice restaurant when,thanks to the sooo spicy food we get really drunks, after the lovely dinner we went to a kind of a improviseated bar, where I meet some nice thay guys,<br />and talking about this and that, I ask them where I could found something to smoke,and 1 of them offer my to smoke some weed, but in a safer place, his house.<br /><br />So, happy me! I jump rear his motobicicle, and after a looot of corners we arrive at his house, then we get inn, and he starts rolling a joint,he smoke a little, pass to me, I smoke some pass to him,<br />and then (we where sit down one side by side in a sofa), he took my dick and look at me!!!<br /><br />At this point all the well difficult to reach &quot;high&quot;&nbsp; when down and, I tall him that I wasn&#039;t gay! that I was just looking for some weed,to bring me back to the bar, but he refused and I just when out of there asap, trying to found my guesthouse or the bar, but since 7 in the morning I was unavailable to find my friend who wasn&#039;t really worried about me?<br /><br />And then another day I had an accident in the island of cosamuy,when I had a motobicicle accident and I hate to pay looots of money to get out of there (I saw the prison)<br />If you want I can explain you that one as well!!<br /><br />P.D.: Sorry for my bad english I&#039;m Spanish
