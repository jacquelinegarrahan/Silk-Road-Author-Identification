				To all the heros, pros and moderators,<br /><br />can someone please shed some more light on this issue since I cannot contribute to the regular forums.<br /><br />Let&#039;s assume that someone used tormail for various purposes - corresponding wiith btc exchangers, backing up private key, so on and so forth<br /><br />What is the BEST course of action?<br /><br />should one access the accounts and delete the contents or keep as far away aspossible and change up all passwords and processes that may have been compromised?<br /><br />Please advise - I am quite concerned about this vulnerability.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for all the good souls that assist the community.

				There is no point accessing the account to delete anything. If the site has been compromised, then everything will have been copied by now.<br /><br />So the best course of action is exactly what DPR said. Assume that anything you ever sent unencrypted via Tormail is currently being read by the pigs.<br /><br />And if that worries you, take action to clean your house up, wipe your PCs, leave the country or whatever you deem to be an appropriate course of action.

				This pretty much proves Snowden&#039;s point of Government invasion of privacy on US citizen for no apparent reason. All of the talk that NSA head-person spoke at Black Hat conference is now null and void. Ah well.

				sometimes i just don&#039;t understand people.<br /><br />why would LE allow you to log into a server they compromised to delete incriminating evidence?<br /><br />in what world does that even make partial sense?&nbsp; <br /><br />stay away from SR, you can&#039;t afford to lose any more brain cells.

				You backed up a private key on tormail?&nbsp; That was retarded.<br /><br />Everything you had there must now be considered compromised.&nbsp; Never use it again, change all passwords, abandon accounts, etc.&nbsp; And FFS, in the future never store anything &quot;in the cloud&quot; that has security implications.<br /><br />Anyway, as stated above, deleting messages would obviously have no effect.&nbsp; The data has been copied by now, it&#039;s a done deal.

				Anything that was stored or sent via that service and was not encrypted was never safe in the first place. Deleting anything now has no benefit and only serves to make it more obvious that you messed up. If you were into serious business and have left a trail then the only thing you can really do is dispose of physical evidence and wipe your systems a few times. The best course of action in relation to the tormail service is to not log into it again I would think, but there&#039;s no way of getting rid of the evidence in that area.

				Can someone suggest the best course of action to obtaining a safe email address? <br />As well as a good method of encrypting future emails. <br /><br />Thanks!
