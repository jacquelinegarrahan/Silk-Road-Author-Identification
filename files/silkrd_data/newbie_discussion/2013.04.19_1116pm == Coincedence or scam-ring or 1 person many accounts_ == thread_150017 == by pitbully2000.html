				As i troll the forums..FINALLY being able to post ( iwas apparently using n address logon for SR that included a &quot;.TO.&quot; in the url and it wasnt letting me post.)<br />Anyway..I keep running across reviews that use the same typo (or so I thought it wsa a typo first time i saw it) seems this person/people/person with more than one account keeps using the word &quot;binded&quot; when they were trying to say a specific compound could not bind well with the other chemicals.<br />&nbsp;No biggie, but why am I seeing this same typo in 4 or 5 other reviewers posted? they all have a couple hundred posts each and it just looks fishy to me. i want to know if I should trust these reviews. Anyhow, keep a look out please and let me know I&#039;m not crazy!

				They probably just fail at the English language.<br /><br />Regardless, never trust a sole review; always cross-check with multiple posts and accounts.

				As the posters above have stated you should take everything posted in these forums with a pinch of salt, feedback manipulation via shill accounts is rife, both on the forums and the main site itself. Vendors using shill buyer accounts to boost stats and post spurious feedback and the same for on here. It&#039;s not all about posting favorable reviews either, some shill accounts are used to attack others to discredit vendors, other forum users and even the mods.<br /><br />The best thing you can do it read as much as you can and in some circumstances contact established members for some advice as they are well placed to know the lay of the land and even the reincarnated versions of new vendors who have previously gone rogue.<br /><br />That might make it all sound to hard basket but it&#039;s not that difficult to navigate your way around things, just takes a few months to really suss this place out if you know what to look for.
