				I&#039;m just curious to know who is the best vendor to purchase MDMA off that ISN&#039;T from the Netherlands, since JoR is out. Thanks.

				That&#039;s the question floating around everyone&#039;s head right now it seems, and there isn&#039;t a good answer for it. There are a few US vendors with nice looking product, but shitty prices. There is tons of EU product out there at a good price, but it all looks like unwashed shit. <br /><br />No JoR and CloudSurfer is in stealth = mdma rough patch<br /><br />I ordered some from Budworx, looks alright and the price was right, but who knows. I&#039;ve had Ivory and SuperTrips stuff, both were good, but Ivory isn&#039;t that cheap and buying from ST is like a roll of the dice, who knows what the end result is gonna be. At this point I am basically testing the waters with small orders and maybe get lucky on a lesser known vendor, but also one with good reputation.

				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b9d8399896<br />mister m100&nbsp; &nbsp;won me over last time I used him.&nbsp; He&#039;s got some really fantastic stealth, and ships from Germany.&nbsp; Product seems to be up there with the rest.&nbsp; Although I didn&#039;t need to message him, people were saying his commutation is often slow/lacking.

				Theres so many dude. The question to ask would be, who should you NOT order from. <br /><br />If your looking for 5gs or better, go with MrAnonymousX. UK&gt;int&#039;l. If you have shitty buyer stats, he may require you to FE if outside of UK. He is solid though, so no worries.<br /><br />I have not seen the current listings, but off the top of my head for personal amount type vendors id suggest StudyBuddy, FullEscrowUk, Subtickle or CloudSurfer, but idk if he does anything less than like a ball, or 5gs... maybe even 10 being the smallest listing. <br /><br />All of the sellers ive mentioned are rock solid business wise, and all have some of the cleanest purest MDMA ive had to date. I did not mention IMB because i doubt your looking for 50gs or better, also he ships out of belgium. Good luck.<br />

				DutchTrade had some very nice white rocks about a month ago. So much business that they had to take a vacation from SR just to catch up. Not sure if scammers took advantage of the no FE policy or if things just slipped up a little bit, but several people were reporting delays and unreceived product towards the end. <br /><br />However, DutchTrade still has a (95) rating and many people posted rave 5/5 reviews. Do a search, as they have their own review thread. Pics and trip reports included. Ships from Germany. No MBBs. The risk is yours.<br /><br />Some friends and I sampled the product about a month ago and it was grade A. In a completely different league than some of the crap I see people try to pass off as MDMA. <br /><br />Put it this way: If DutchTrade&#039;s product makes it to you, you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br /><br />Recently they put their listings back up so I&#039;d keep an eye out for reviews/updates.

				Definitely a lot of awesome suppliers here, but yeah some of the go to guys are out at the moment.&nbsp; That is if you&#039;re looking for personal quantity from top rated international suppliers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Right now I&#039;d recommend DutchTrade.&nbsp; If you can wait and you&#039;re looking for a little more than personal use, wait for CloudSurfer to put listings up.&nbsp; &nbsp;
