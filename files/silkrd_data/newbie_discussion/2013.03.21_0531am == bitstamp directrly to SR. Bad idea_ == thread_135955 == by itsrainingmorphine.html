				I have been doing a plethora of research on how to use SR safely, securely and responsibly and I am ready to put BTC in my SR wallet.<br />I&#039;ve decided to use the CVS cash deposit through BitInstant to BitStamp.<br />However, the item I have selected is pricey and I dont want to risk losing that money shuffling them through all kinds of wallets and services so I was wondering if it would be safe (for both SR and myself) to transfer the whole sum ($330) from BitStamp directly to my SR wallet.<br />BitStamp seems much more relaxed than places like Mt. Gox<br />Replys much appreciated. Noobs unite!<br /><br />And don&#039;t forget to put your buckets out side..... cause ItsRainingMorphine :)

				As long as you are careful and backup all the addresses you are using there is little to no risk of losing bitcoins sending them through wallets/tumblers. Its worth the minor cost and hassle for the peace of mind, imo.

				it perhaps may be a bit safer to send directly from your own wallet address.&nbsp; 8)

				I at least send from exchange platform to a (one of several i maintain) blockchain wallet. There you can send BTC through the &#039;shared send&#039; function for a small fee, and it sends it through a big shared wallet with lots of bitcoins. i take it one more step and shared send to my encrypted bitcoin wallet. I do this all using a VPN. and then i send to SR using tor later<br />I&#039;m thinking of using bitcoin fog in the future. i heard the sr cointumbler works only for withdrawals, but i don&#039;t know... BE SAFE :)

				i use and like bitcoinfog as a middle step, but bear in mind the cost of the 3% fee as bitcoin prices continue to rise rapidly!

				Maybe I&#039;m being stupid about it, but I just go straight from bitstamp to SR and never have any problems. Then again my knowledge of bitcoinfog and other things is very limited, I&#039;m surprised I managed to get this far and make succesfull orders as it is.<br />But perhaps a little more paranoia could be a good thing. But as I&#039;m only buying a little LSD and some mephedrone etc., not big quantities, I don&#039;t think there will be anybody out there putting a lot of time and effort into tracking me down.
