				I have not bothered to reach 50 post count in order to post on the actual forums here and I really need some advice to give to a really close friend.<br /><br /><br />My friend has been ordering various things off sr to his house, and he has also been peddleing them to 3 extremely close friends for a cheap price (who then resold for higher profit). This has been going on for two months now.<br /><br />Two days ago, he was informed by a police officer (a family friend) that he is being watched very very closely, they know hes been getting packages of drugs. However, no controlled delivery has been attempted. So, my friend cleaned his house, cleaned his computer, informed his friends in person not over phones, and gave it all up for good.<br /><br />Will he be safe? He told me the last package he recieved there was 100g of molly and the mylar bag was open! as if someone cut it! Yet he still recieved it and already sold the whole thing to his best mate (who already sold it by the gram).<br /><br />His friends are trustworthy , and would not gjve him up.<br /><br /><br />Also! I have to mention that the LE in his area arent very technologically advanced - you could say. The last murder took 8 years to solve here (was solved half a year ago).<br /><br /><br /><br />Can he still be fucked by LE?

				I&#039;m not an expert on law, but if his house &amp; computer are completely clean and he keeps his mouth shut, he should be fine ;)

				I hope that is the case. Do you think if they were going to arrest him, they already wouldhave done so already (when he first recieved this last order which was a week ago)?

Don&#039;t be naive and say that they would not give you up. LE go to great lengths to strengthen their case. If they haven&#039;t busted you yet, it&#039;s because they don&#039;t have enough for a warrant or are probably tied up with catching bigger fish. You are taking the right steps to protect yourself. Don&#039;t accept anymore shipments and don&#039;t assume any unnecessary risks for a while... at least until the heat has died down.<br /><br />LE are not stupid and should NEVER be underestimated. Please don&#039;t ever forget that. If they&#039;ve caught wind that you&#039;re receiving 100g packages of MDMA they might be watching you to see if you&#039;re handing that quantity to someone else. Remember, they want to make big busts and catch the dealers at the top of their respective food chains. <br /><br />Good luck and best wishes man. Stay safe and let the heat die off before doing anything else illegal. Going to jail for drugs is not worth it when you can mitigate the risks now!<br /><br />-CC<br /><br />

				Haha, your a funny one. I don&#039;t think anything has to resort to violence, as it would attract obvious attention.<br /><br />Also, it really isn&#039;t about me, but I have contact with this close friend and do business with him (taught him the ways od the road) and if he goes down, it won&#039;t be good for me. <br /><br />I just met with him for coffee, and he said asrediculous as it sounds - &quot;I&#039;m thinking this was a warning call, basically if I don&#039;t stop now they&#039;ll probably get me&quot;<br /><br /><br />Its believable, because this happened before, this family friend contacted his family and they were to inform him the exact place and time when he done a deal last year (4 ozs of bud) and they stated they watched the whole transaction, yet let it off as a warning for some retardedly stupid reason. Maybe its because his father works with the police? Who knows... Then again, I could be completely wrong.<br /><br />I will update if anything happens

				It&#039;s hard to believe the cops wouldn&#039;t get involved with 100g&#039;s, especially if they already confirmed it was mdma. i doubt the package was discovered.
