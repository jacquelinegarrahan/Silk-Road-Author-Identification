				Hi,<br /><br />I want to buy some LSD. It will be my first, so I want to make sure that it&#039;s good.<br /><br />I know about the &quot;The Avengers LSD Vendors Review&quot; thread, so I looked for a good vendor and product.<br /><br />I found albionessentialols (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1a8c799e25) from netherlands. He gets great reviews and he seems to ship super stealthy. <br /><br />But as it is my first order on sr, I&#039;m really nervous. I want it to ship to Germany. Is it save to order from netherlands to germany? I already asked this question in another thread, but didn&#039;t received any answer.<br /><br />Maybe I could order from alaska instead. He is from Germany:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a417a0f08f<br />Unfortunately he is off for holiday until 21.05 and he isn&#039;t tested by &quot;the avengers&quot;, so I&#039;m not sure if it is great LSD.<br />If you look at his picture you can see, that the LSD has the same blotter art. It is also 120 mic (albionessentialols&#039; LSD has 130, but maybe he is just not so precisely?). Could it be the same LSD? If yes, I would probably wait until 21.05<br /><br />I just want to have good LSD for a great first experience and albionessentialols seems to be the king of good products. - Or shouldn&#039;t I be worrying so much? Aren&#039;t there to many differences with LSD?

				If it were me ordering, I&#039;d order from jerseycow, dude has great feedback and some glorious tabbage at good prices. I wouldn&#039;t be worried about a NL shipment to germany from any decent vendor, seeing that they&#039;re both in the EU

				Same print doesn&#039;t always mean same quantity (or quality) of acid. <br />And even if it originally was the same quantity and quality, depending on the way it was stored/sent there can be a difference. <br /><br />If I remember right Mahakala sends from Germany. <br />I never tried his acid (but have some mescaline lying around somewhere), but the guy has a good reputation, has been tested by the Avengeres (I think) and his trips seem to be nice. <br />Check his page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/48acf93c90<br /><br />But I wouldn&#039;t mind ordering L from Holland. It&#039;s almost impossible for it te be caught at the customs... <br /><br />Enjoy it and share your experience @ the Avengers
