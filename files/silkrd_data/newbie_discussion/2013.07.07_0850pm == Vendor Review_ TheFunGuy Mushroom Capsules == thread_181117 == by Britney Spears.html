				Dose: 3.5 Grams of Mushrooms in 7 capsules. Split 4 ways doing the &quot;Lemon tek&quot; with lime. <br />Time of Day: 6:30 PM<br /><br />We were hesitant that an 8th would knock around 4 of us, but we went ahead and took them anyway. We decided to go with the lemon technique, as it is suppose to be a stronger buzz. After about a 30 minute wait, while the Pink Buffalos soaked in the lime juice, we drank the concoction and chased it with a little OJ. After about 20 minutes we were all laughing and started to feel an almost extreme come up. I took off outside from the garage and sat on a nearby ledge and enjoyed my perception change. Every sense became heightened and my smile became more permanent. After about an hour I was in the throws of a heavy mushroom trip. A friend and I looked up at the sky, the clouds were moving very quickly and covered the area like a purple blanket. Sober people showed up now and then, but caused us no negative emotions as I focused on the trip and not on the outsiders. The intense trip lasted about 3 and&nbsp; half hours. I drove home while still tripping and it was wonderful. The lights were extreme and every noise was a welcomed scare. I had NPR&#039;s Blues Before Sunrise blaring some rough rough jazz recording. It was perfection. After about 5 hours of taking less than a gram I was ready for sleep. A weird sleep.<br /><br />Communication: 5/5<br />Stealth: 10/5<br />Product:10/5<br /><br />I was hesitant about capsules. I am now a believer. TheFunGuy is a great mushroom vendor.
