				I can&#039;t post this in the main discussion because I haven&#039;t posted enough on the forums before but this is worth posting about.<br /><br />I&#039;m very concerned about this new feedback system and consider this a gross violation of buyer / seller privacy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wayyyy too much information is shown about transactions and buyer information.&nbsp; With precise information given about every feedback&#039;s buyer stats, transaction amounts, etc it&#039;s easy for an outside observer to correlate every transaction that a buyer (as well as seller) has ever made, deduce the scope of business being done by buyers and sellers and provide nice evidence to be used in court against them.<br /><br />This is even the case for &quot;private&quot; transactions that I&#039;m sure neither buyers nor sellers want details of published.&nbsp; &nbsp;To make matters worse the largest private transactions are given the highest weight and published at the very top of the feedback page.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure these buyers DON&#039;T want the precise date and amount they spent on $20,000+ orders published for the world to see along with every other order they have ever placed with every seller they have bought from.&nbsp; There is a reason we do private listings.&nbsp; They are meant to be PRIVATE!!<br /><br />The publishing of this information was incredibly wreckless and inconsiderate on the part of DPR and leads me to question if we can continue doing business on his site.&nbsp; This is after-all a site where highly illegal activity is engaged in and there is an expectation that user data will be used responsibly.&nbsp; &nbsp; Even Amazon / eBay are more conscientious about protecting the privacy of their users.<br /><br />Please can anyone re-post this on the main page so that these major security concerns can be addresses by those in charge.

				Alot of this info can already be accounted for, now its just easier to access. Also im sure dpr has adequate security in place. But i do agree i would be happier without all of this info out in the open.

				My self, and many others that I have discussed this with, also believe this to be a major security risk. In many ways. I strongly protest this new system.

				agreed with the majority.. I don&#039;t even like seeing other peoples transaction info. I&#039;m sure those that have 80+k spent in a matter of months don&#039;t like it either.
