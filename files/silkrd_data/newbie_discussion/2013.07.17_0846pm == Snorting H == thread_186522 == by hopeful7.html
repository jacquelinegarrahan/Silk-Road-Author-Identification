				I have only tried from two vendors ever.&nbsp; The first did not bother my nose at all, but I also feel the product was very weak. The second met my expectations but really messed with my nose and throat.&nbsp; The first few days were fine, but as time went on, it really burned, and from what I read, this should not have happened with infrequent use and in that short of a time. I tried to wash out my nostrils, and I put Vaseline at night.&nbsp; This particular product also had the slight smell of vinegar.<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted some input/feedback from more experienced users. I really do not like smoking, because it is a waste and doesn&#039;t do much for me, and I don&#039;t use needles.&nbsp; I am curious if any of you have experienced such irritation in such a short time?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your input.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Hope

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully more experience H users can respond, but that vinegar smell/taste is thought by many users to indicate quality gear. The best gear from the Road I&#039;ve tried, however, didn&#039;t have the vinegar, and it burned a little, but not a lot. Other strong heroin I&#039;ve tried IRL has been vinegary, and burnt a bit. Not as much as you&#039;re saying happened to you, though.<br />&nbsp; Insufflation (snorting) is my preferred route of administration, though, so my nostrils and canals are probably pretty scarred already :) If you start to bleed, you&#039;re doing damage, sorry that&#039;s about all I&#039;ve got, AB.

				You should not use Pulp Fiction as a guide to drug effects. <br />Operative word is &quot;Fiction&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve snorted heroin a lot of times. It should not hurt. It might sting a little for a second but that&#039;s all. If it hurts like meth there is something wrong in my opinion

				Thank you for all your replies. I also did not think it should hurt as much as it did, completely irritating toward the end of what I ordered. And I use sparingly.&nbsp; Kind of scary, really, and frustrating that I finally found some that does the job, but now this nasty side effect.&nbsp; Maybe I will ask the vendor if he has heard this from anyone else?&nbsp; I will have to also do some more research on my own.

				Sorry for the delay in replying. The vinegar smell comes from the acetic acid used in the process of changing opium to heroin. It&#039;s the acid in vinegar. I assume the smell comes from impure acetic acid ie industrial grade, or the final purifying steps are skipped in the heroin processing. Mexican black tar is an extreme example. There&#039;s an informative guide that the DEA of all people put out some years ago, basically a how-to on making heroin. Funny.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link&nbsp; http://www.onlinepot.org/grow/deaopiumgrowguide.htm

				Pretty sure whatever this is cut with is not agreeing with me at all.&nbsp; Still, I am afraid to try someone new, due to the quality and &quot;legs&quot; on this vendor&#039;s product.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first few times are okay, then I start to get all stuffed up and it starts stinging.&nbsp; Also, the minute it hits (and I try not to snort it too strong, just little sniffs so it sits in the nose and doesn&#039;t drip down my throat, if you KWIM) I sometimes start to sneeze like crazy; like hard sneezes five to six times in a row (with my nose plugged, if possible, lol).&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it wasteful to mix with a little water and drip that into my nose?<br /><br /><br />Also, at night I am washing out my nostrils and putting some Vaseline in there for healing: trying what I can.<br /><br />Does snorting heroin make anyone else want to sneeze?<br /><br />Thanks for all your replies!&nbsp; :)

				What kind of heroin are you doing? It shouldn&#039;t feel like that. But in answer to your question, No, it is not wasteful to dissolve it in water and drip it. That&#039;s how&nbsp; used to do BTH because you cant snort that crap.

				Even dissolving in water seems to hurt. Whatever is in this stuff is just hurting me.&nbsp; As good as the product is, I cannot order from that person anymore. I am not sure if it is &quot;just me,&quot; but even with the water, it stings and burns. If a little gets to the back of my throat it gives me a sore throat.....instantly, too.&nbsp; I order this infrequently, but unfortunately, for my next order I will have to try someone new. I am now letting my nose heal and no more!&nbsp; :(
