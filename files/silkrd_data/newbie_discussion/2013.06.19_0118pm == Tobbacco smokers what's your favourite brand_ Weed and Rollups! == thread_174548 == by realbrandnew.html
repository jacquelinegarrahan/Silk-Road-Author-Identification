				Hey folks I am wondering what people like to smoke there roll ups and joints with. <br /><br />My number one choice for roll ups and joints is Amber Leaf&nbsp; Maybe just left out to dry up for an hour then sealed, i think it&#039;s the best flavour for smoking weed with, also makes a good roll up!! I used to only smoke cigarettes e.g L&amp;B and Silk Cut etc but my tastes have changed over the years, I will point blank refuse a joint with and cigarette tobacco in it.<br /><br />Other rolling tobacco I like are Turner, Drum, B&amp;H, Samson, Pall Mall plus a few more I can&#039;t think of right now.<br /><br />I HATE Golden Virginia. I used to really really love Domingo, but refuse to make a joint with it anymore as it has changed, way too dry and harsh, I&#039;d probably not even make a roll up out of it these days. Seen a few of the cheaper foreign tobaccos locally around town usually in the local boozer recently but they just don&#039;t seem as good quality usually too wet and won&#039;t dry or a heavy flavor.. I don&#039;t like anything to dry, too coarse, or too wet, or a heavy smell like Golden Virginia. <br /><br />So what&#039;s your preference ???<br /><br />I&#039;d love to know as I&#039;m trying to source some tobacco but for foreign (EU) brands as they seem a little cheaper, but I am not sure on the quality and similarity to Amber Leaf. If anybody knows of any foreign brands that are very similar to Amber Leaf or any my favorites above, I&#039;d love to know!<br /><br />Also if you are weed snob and don&#039;t like to use any devils weed (tobacco) then let me know that as well so I can be envious and super jealous that you can afford to smoke pure ;P<br /><br />(I&#039;m)Real (and it&#039;s) Brand New<br /><br /><br />

				We have a purist the house great stuff! I would love to able to roll without baccy, I do smoke the odd bong/pipe and I have vaped quite a bit but don&#039;t own one. WB do you roll or vape or bong oh I forgot you may eat it as well duh!? I don&#039;t know if anybody has ever seen a documentary on BBC where some crazy ass bitch gets in IV of THC, and doesn&#039;t enjoy herself....... no shit Sherlock. I like to have a joint, I can roll one and potter about for an hour or so without lighting it up, just the smell of the weed right under my nose is enjoyable! Bongs for when I need a quick hit without much fuss!<br /><br />

				Gotta be Amber Leaf, not too expensive and it&#039;s pretty good for joint and for regular smoking. I&#039;ve tried getting into using Drum tobacco but it has a horrible smell and doesn&#039;t taste good atall! You get what you pay for haha. Golden Virgina is a bit too wet for me. L&amp;B is quite good for a joint as well!

				Not sure if I have tried L&amp;B rolling yet, I may have done a little while back but i may be getting muddled between B&amp;H silver and old rolling baccy.<br />To be honest I haven&#039;t had any drum for years I used to like it but it may have changed, also it&#039;s not popular with the local fagman, just in case you are American or confused by the term fag I didn&#039;t mean the gay man at no. 89 although he is a Bi-sexual and he doesn&#039;t really live at no. 89.<br /><br />LGF the price of Amber Leaf is going up again, you may have noticed already. I have been buying the 10g packets as they are convenient and not compressed like the boxes are. This one reason why I am looking to get hold of some baccy cheap The guy down the pub or the guy at no. 89 doesn&#039;t get Amber Leaf they are usually something completely foreign and usually of a poor quality and never dry out.<br /><br />Thanks for the views so far!!<br />

Gold Leaf is a cheaper alternative but I can&#039;t convince myself to enjoy it, it&#039;s just something about it that I don&#039;t like haha. JPS tobacco, not the cigarettes, is quite fine and I think it&#039;s still relatively cheap but haven&#039;t bought it in about six months or so.

				I am smoking tobacco years and tried many different brands.<br />One of the best though is the Greek George Karelia and Sons.<br />http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M2VVvUMO8Uo/T-yrmEr4lrI/AAAAAAAABI4/RlNi7ic0cAg/s1600/2010-11-12+15-47-10_0006.jpg<br /><br />It smells amazing and the taste is just wonderful. Almost everybody smokes tobacco in Greece and the industry of tobacco has become really competitive when it comes to quality. If you are able to order it through internet I would friendly advice you people to try it.<br /><br />

				I am smoking Pall Mall right now, first time for me 30g red pouch, I got it given from a friend, good consistency just a little different from Amber Leaf in taste and smell but other than that a nice rolling medium. Best part about it is that I received it gratis from someone who recently visited Spain or at least somewhere warm, with foreign writing! Seems as I currently have more BTC than pounds (but not in 1p coins though) I have about 65p it was a much welcome gift. <br /><br /><br />Adamiz thanks for the suggestion, if I come across it on SR i will take a look!<br /><br />Thanks one and all for replying and giving me your views and WhistleBlower I&#039;m still envious of your smoking choice!!<br /><br />

				When I used to smoke cigs whatever I&#039;d have on hand, from Marlboro on a good day to a Sterling single brought from the shop on others. Rolling with Sterlings was always such a chore though, the cheap quality makes it like rolling with pebbles. <br /><br />Now it&#039;s usually a low nicotine content one like Silk Cut but flavored tobacco&#039;s good if you can get it too, or menthol.<br /><br />
