				- See last post of this thread for most recent updates -<br />--------------<br />Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about starting to spread the love ♥ here on the road. <br />And by love I mean: high purity LSD.<br /><br />I will not be offering commercial-grade LSD like allot of blotters that are being spread from Holland (e.g. Hofmann Bicycles). These are typically laid with less pure crystal. I also noticed most claimed dosages are severely exaggerated.<br /><br />I am experienced with this wonderful molecule and will do my best to get it in its intact form into your body. <br /><br />I&#039;m just wondering if there would be sufficient interest for this.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; Vendor account is up: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b487aa3ec2 :)<br />EDIT2: New thread! http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=171891.0

				Xtal is greyish white btw.<br /><br /><br />Some info on xtal quality that has been circulated widely on the internet:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">TYPES OF CRYSTAL<br /><br />Needlepoint -very pure(95%) white powerdery crystal,was available in small amount`s. The best of the best<br /><br />White Fluff -Very pure(95%) white light flakes of crystal. Still around and the most sought after. very pure<br /><br />Silver -Good and clean(85-90%)-light greyish crystal. Was an unbelievable amount of this around in the late eighty`s and early nineties. Very good stuff. My first thumbprint was this kind. If you ate acid in the 80-90`s you probably sampled some silver.<br /><br />Amber -Decent(70%?) This crystal varied from a light amber color to an almost dark brown color.Was always available.One batch called quadricept amber was the color of light honey and was very good.Lot`s a people worked with this crystal but I always would use silver instead since it was better and the same price.<br /><br />Lavender -(60-70%?) light purple to almost black colored crystal. Like amber it varied batch to batch.<br /><br />TJ (tornado juice) - purity unknown. I seen this shit in about four different colors and it always scared me. No experiance with it.<br /><br />Champagne -(50-60%) black crystal, nasty stuff IMHO. I worked with it once and swore to never touch it again.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Hi LightOfPi and welcome on the road!<br />A new vendor with high quality LSD and not from the netherlands? Sounds good to me! I&#039;m sure you can build up a solid customer base, especially if you come up with liquid LSD and candy!<br />Tell us when you&#039;re starting, I will order :)

Every week I hear around people asking for very good LSD, and the LSD thread in the rumor mill is one of the most visited (it is surely the most visited of the psychedelics products). There are many vendors that have good LSD in the SR, but in reality not so many that have a TOP product. If you do, expect a market so good that you will have problems keeping on.<br /><br />It is just that many of these people don&#039;t wander too much on the newbie section. When you will have 50 post (and you are very near) I suggest you to go to the LSD thread and post there for the samples and reviews, I assure you they will JUMP on you&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Here is it the thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.0<br />

				I&#039;ve figured out a way to safely ship the liquid, but it will take some time to get the right packaging materials. Will not be for tomorrow.<br />I want to make sure it&#039;s 100% safe before I send anything, specially to the USA.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stick to the candy &amp; blotter in the meanwhile.<br /><br />@BlackIris: I am well aware of the Avengers and other vendors.<br />I will pop in there later once my account is up and running.<br /><br />Hope to send out first samples next week!<br /><br />

				The picture I added is not mine btw, but it&#039;s the exact same print!<br /><br />It&#039;s based on a painting by the amazing artist Alex Grey (who is raising funds to build a psychedelic art temple - check it out if you&#039;re interested) and depicts the discoverer of LSD: Albert Hofmann.

				Hi LightofPi, I&#039;m always interested in &quot;non-commercial&quot; prints but I&#039;ve seen this Albert Hoffman print a lot over the past while - are you synthesising the molecule or observing the process closely or are you buying from another vendour? Please excuse the fauz-pas if this is a rude question (like asking a female her age...)<br />There are some prints that are only being distributed on SR by one or two people, so i&#039;m interested in how varied the chemical can be within the prints - I always thought each new batch should have a new print, but that certainly doesn&#039;t seem to be the way.<br />

				I would happily review your samples, if I was a trusted member.<br />Anyway, it&#039;s always good to see another LSD EU vendor, and you seem pretty serious and enthusiastic. Maybe I order a hit to try your stuff in my next order, since in my country the LSD is disappearing: in the streets you only find 25i-nbome or empty blotters for a similar price as yours...<br /><br />Hope you succeed here!

				I am in EU., if you want to send me a sample, I do not have a lot of post but a very good reputation buyer, and I know the LSD. I ate a lot (my teeth are a good witness ^ ^) timothy leary etc.. so if you want to send me a sample I would be very happy. if they are good I would be delighted to buy a good amount<br />

				The first order has arrived! As most of you can see now I&#039;m not here to scam anyone. <br /><br />But there are still 2 free samples left so see for yourself! Max 1 per person.<br />silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c696b71afc<br /><br />You can also add a sample to a regular order, so you only pay for (stealthy!) shipping once, but still get a free tab!
