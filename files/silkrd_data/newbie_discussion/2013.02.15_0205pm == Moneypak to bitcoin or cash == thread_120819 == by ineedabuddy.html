				Hello SR community! This is my first post. <br /><br />I recently got my hands on moneypak and found a BMR vendor (name I will withold until I know for certain I am not getting my bticoins) who told me he would exchange my moneypak for bitcoins. Of course he wanted me to send info first, which I unwillingly obliged. He had 24 sales so I figured he was somewhat reputable. He told me he needed a few hours to get me the bitcoins. It&#039;s been about 24 hours now and he still hasn&#039;t responded to my messages or sent me anything. I am assuming I got scammed for now. <br /><br />Now, instead of having to deal with scumbags like him, how would one cash out a moneypak? I understand you can use a prepaid debit card, but that requires a SS#, which I don&#039;t think is appropriate for me to give out. Or does anyone know of any other way to use moneypak to buy goods on SR?<br /><br />Also it seems like this is the only place on the forum where I can create new posts. I guess this is because I am a noobie?

				Yes it&#039;s cause you&#039;re a n00b.<br /><br />Moneypak is the haven of scam artists.&nbsp; Use BitCopia or BitInstant to get your coins.&nbsp; You can also use BlueSkyTraders here.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you really mean to &quot;cash out&quot; your moneypak, but you could easily just load the code onto your paypal and have money that way.&nbsp; This guy undoubtedly already cashed it though...&nbsp; Sorry charlie.
