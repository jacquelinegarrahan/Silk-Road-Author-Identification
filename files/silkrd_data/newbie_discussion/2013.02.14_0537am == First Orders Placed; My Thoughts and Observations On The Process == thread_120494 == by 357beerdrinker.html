				I hit the bank earlier and made my cash deposit to get my BTC and they were in my wallet by the time I logged on from home.&nbsp; That only took 5 minutes and I was in and out with no worries.&nbsp; LOL, I was given a whole nickel from the change on my deposit (It was $XXX.95 total) and when I walked out of the bank, some guy was pulling the old &quot;got any change?&quot; scam in the parking lot so I tossed him my shiny new nickel and told him good luck.&nbsp; I got a good laugh on my walk back to work from that.<br /><br />I went ahead and placed orders this evening for a few things I&#039;m interested in.&nbsp; Only one vendor requires FE for new buyers and they seem to have solid forum reviews and it&#039;s also the cheapest item I bought so if it&#039;s a lesson learned, it&#039;s a cheap one.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that my order has to progress to a certain status before the FE option is available?<br /><br />Based on posts I&#039;ve read, I used my real name and address.&nbsp; My building is not openly accessible by the public so any packages that don&#039;t fit in my mail will be held at the office and I order quite a bit of things on the internet like a lot of people here do.&nbsp; The mailboxes aren&#039;t even visible from outside the building so I hope that helps.<br /><br />It&#039;s almost surreal that it&#039;s this convenient as long as you pay attention to what you&#039;re doing.&nbsp; I hope we all focus on our own risk reduction and the vendors do too so we can all enjoy this awesome opportunity.<br /><br />Best of luck to everyone else going through their first time(s)<br />

				Congrats man! Wait till you open your package. You did PGP encrypt right? Also your shipping situation is similar to my own! I like our odds!

				Yes, I used PGP encryption but I just found out I made a rookie mistake.&nbsp; I never selected the vendor&#039;s key off the keyring so everything I sent was encrypted using my own key.&nbsp; I figured I&#039;d do something incorrect but at least it was an error that couldn&#039;t be decrypted.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already sent emails to the vendors with their keys so they can get my address decrypted.<br /><br />Lesson learned and noted.&nbsp;

				I have made a few transactions and thus far only 1 has made it through. Partly my mistakes by risking FE and questionable vendors. Reading the forums it seems noobs are regularly targetted for scamming even by established and reputable vendors. MAke your first purchases small and keep your guard up. If you get a few mails not arriving then you will need to make a judgement on whether your address is compromised; selective scam; or something else .... which is not easy.<br /><br />Stay alert and build up a suite of potential drops. I&#039;d say that bit is the hardest part.<br /><br /><br />

				Congrats on your first purchase. The convenience still blows me away. I haven&#039;t done a local transaction in forever.

				Sounds like you have a pretty good set up. First order off the silk road is always exciting.
