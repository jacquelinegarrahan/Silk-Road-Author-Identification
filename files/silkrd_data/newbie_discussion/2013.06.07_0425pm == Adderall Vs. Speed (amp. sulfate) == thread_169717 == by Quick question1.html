				What could one expect after only doing adderall (intranasally) &amp; then switching to speed (also intranasal)? Specifically: Is the burn greater or worse than adderall? Is the dosage the same (assuming the speed&#039;s purity % has been factored in) MG for MG with both? Are the duration of effects, feelings/experience, and comedown the same for both?

				<br />I found this great explanation about the differences between speed and adderall at http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27177.msg296149#msg296149<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: schranz link=topic=27177.msg296149#msg296149</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Adderal is a mix of 25% Levoamphetamine + 75% Dextroamphetamine whereas (European) Street Speed is composed of 50% Levo- and 50% Dextroamphetamine.<br /><br />Levoamphetamine is responsible for most of the physiological effects (dilated pupils, grinding your teeth, ...) also it releases mainly Noradrenaline.<br />Dextroamphetamine is responsible for most of the psychological effects (concentration, energy, confidence, ...) and releases mainly Dopamine.<br /><br />so more dexamph=more fun, less side effects.<br /><br />In your case i would say stay with the Adderall.<br /><br />Hope i could help you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I take adderall daily, it is prescriped.<br /><br />Adderall can be called &quot;speed.&quot; Speed is a vague and generic word. It can mean any one of the 4 amphetamine salts found in adderall--- it really depends on what the speed is made up of.<br /><br />If the speed is only say, Amphetamine Sulfate, one of the 4 salts in adderall-- then you will experience the effects that this compound tends to produce. i believe Amphetamine Sulfate has a less noticeable effect in regards to the bad feelings that addreall can bring-- the increased blood pressure; nervousness, etc.<br /><br />When i see &quot;speed&quot; advertised on SR, it is often Amphetamine Sulfate.<br /><br />I will say this, and this is speaking from experience: if you abuse adderall long enough it will be very hard to feel motivated without it. It has taken me years to function on a normal dose of adderall. DO not binge on this stuff.

				My 2cents<br /><br />I&#039;ve had tons of adderall (75/25 d, l- amp).<br />-love it, miss my Rx. I find it suits whatever I&#039;m facing at (work or play).<br /><br />Had tons of vyvanse (extended release d-amp essentially).<br />-I like it. I prefer adderall because I concentrate better on it and I just handle it better. d-amp can be a bit too self indulgent at times but great for recreation. Adderall is good for both work or play for me.<br /><br />Had different speed from SR (50/50 d, l- amp).<br />-the quality and effects vary wildy between vendors/batches.<br />In general Ive been disapointed with SR speed. The one glowing exception was a recent sample from German vendor JohnnyDeal. This was to me no different than Adderall in it&#039;s effects and I absolutely LOVED it. Overall this was the most enjoyable instance of SR amphetamine I&#039;ve experienced. I&#039;m still waiting for JohnnyDeal to return with his listings (he&#039;s been on vacation, for his sake I hope he isn&#039;t affected by the flood).<br /><br />Had pure dexedrine from SR (all d-amp).<br />-This was fucking awesomely fun stuff but my god does it punish you when you abuse it! And its extremely easy to do so. Awesome awesome times with this and concentration. Followed by lqte peripheral and psychological side effects (pqnic attqck for me)and comedown that makes meth look likea holiday. But Id snag ot up in a heartbeat if vendor Ruthenium offers it again (he said he will).

				Adderall is much safer and a lot more fun.&nbsp; learn about it and learn your dosing and it will take you further without destroying your life.
