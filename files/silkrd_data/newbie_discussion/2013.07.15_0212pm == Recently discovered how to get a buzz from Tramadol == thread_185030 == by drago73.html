				I just recently learned this. I don&#039;t have much of an opiate tolerance being a benzo user mainly. But i discovered if i take 300 mgs of tramadol i definitely get a nice buzz. It&#039;s very similar to opiates, yet slightly different. Kinda like methadone if i had to compare. I just keep thinking back to all those past prescriptions for Tramadol that i would just wad up and throw in the trash. What a waste!

				Yeah you can get a buzz off Tramadol<br /><br />It can also be an absolute bitch to withdraw from if you get hooked, and it has contraindications with a lot of drugs so be very careful with combinations and always do your research.

I had a prescription for it, I only took a few at the time and ended up stock piling quite a few. Fast forward a few months I took a few too many by accident for a headache (I didn&#039;t realise how strong they were, didn&#039;t know much about opiates at the time) and started to go through them and found myself thinking of crazy ways to get more.<br /><br />Tramadol also lowers the seizure threshold so be careful, quote from Wikipedia (clearnet: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol):<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Wikipedia Tramadol Article</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> By itself, it can decrease the seizure threshold. When combined with SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or in patients with epilepsy, the seizure threshold is further decreased. Seizures have been reported in humans receiving excessive single oral doses (700 mg) or large intravenous doses (300 mg). However, there have been several rare cases of people having grand-mal seizures at doses as low as 100â€“400 mg orally.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks everybody. I&#039;ve definitely got a cheap buzz, but don&#039;t recommend it. Have taken 1000 mgs since yesterday morning and don&#039;t even wanna think about how much damage i did to my liver. Am now drinking water like it&#039;s going out of style to help flush out liver and kidneys. As i type i&#039;ve got 2mg&#039;s of xanax dissolving under my tongue. Does any body have more tips for flushing out system?

				It feels like any other opiate/opiod minus the euphoria. I&#039;d honestly rather take kratom than tramadol. There&#039;s also the seizure issue at doses that can get one high.
