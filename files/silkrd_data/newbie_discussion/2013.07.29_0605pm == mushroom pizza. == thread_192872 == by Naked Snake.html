				I&#039;m wanting to make a pizza with mushrooms on it, should I put them on before I cook it or after? I heard you can burn away the chemicals that make you trip. anyone have any experience? I&#039;m wanting to make a thincrust BBQ chicken pizza with onions and mushroom powder.

				Though I&#039;ve never made any mushroom pizza, psilocybin degrades at high temps, which is why you can&#039;t smoke boomers.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be probably cooking your pizza at around 425 F, too hot for the mushies.<br /><br />I would definitely put them on afterwards.&nbsp; Good luck!

				sprinkle them on when it&#039;s finished and enjoy.&nbsp; the psilocybin will burn off and never get the chance to be converted to psilocin in your tummy and make you happy fun time.&nbsp; 8)

				I used to work for Pizza Hut when I was 17 and you could call up and order a cubensis pizza for $80.&nbsp; The manager was in on it too.&nbsp; We used to sell about 10 of them a week.&nbsp; Each pizza was good for 4 people to eat an eighth.<br /><br />:-)

				You will not burn away the chemicals on pys mushrooms if you put them in the oven.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If they&#039;re dry, they&#039;re just going to get crispier.<br /><br />If they&#039;re wet, they&#039;re just going to cook.<br /><br />You will still trip balls.&nbsp; Heat doesn&#039;t kill the pysolcybin.&nbsp; Does heat kill thc when you smoke fine herb?&nbsp; No.<br /><br />I hope that makes sense.<br /><br />NoQ

				it sounds like a fun idea but i wouldn&#039;t do it for the following reason:<br /><br />a pizza is not easy to digest for your body. that shrooms put a big strain on it as well. the odds of having a bad trip increase a good chunk. also, the &quot;cleaning up&quot; of your body, meaning getting the poison out&quot; will take longer too.<br /><br />have a light meal, then 1,5 hours later eat those shrooms. have some fruit during the trip.<br /><br />

				Personally I would just chow down the shrooms on their own on an empty stomach. Each to their own I guess!
