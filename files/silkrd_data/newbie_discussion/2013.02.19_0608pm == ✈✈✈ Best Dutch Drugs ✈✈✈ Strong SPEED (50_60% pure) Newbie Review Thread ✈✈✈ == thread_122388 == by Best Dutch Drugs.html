				Hi and welcome,<br /><br />This WAS the NEWBIE review thread for our mixed 50/60% pure SPEED / AMPETHAMINE (or the Dutch call it PEP). It WAS mixed with paracetamol with is suitable for snorting but not for smoking or injecting. The reason we didn&#039;t take this into consideration was because we&#039;ve never heard of anyone smoking or injecting speed in the Netherlands, it&#039;s quite unusual here.<br /><br />Reason explained more thoroughly here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121844.msg866496#msg866496<br /><br /><br />When you have more then fifty posts then post your review here, in the rumor mill section: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124462.0<br /><br />We have a separate newbie review thread for our UNMIXED very strong speed which is around 75/80% pure, all unmixed speed reviews go there: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121844.0<br /><br />We decided to discontinue selling our MIXED speed because we&#039;ve noticed that too many people also smoke or inject while it&#039;s only suitable for snorting.When you want to smoke or inject our speed you should only buy our most pure speed.<br /><br />We listen to our customers and even though we&#039;re telling you that you shouldn&#039;t smoke or inject this speed we decided to stop selling our mixed speed all together, since there will still be people doing it and we don&#039;t feel comfortable with that.<br /><br />The idea behind also offering a mixed speed listing was because we wanted to provide this service, because we think most people don&#039;t snort our purest speed from the start.<br /><br />But since it only takes us extra effort to create, and we don&#039;t earn anything extra on it we want to stop selling it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Link 5gr Very Strong Speed: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/3b2fd21d6d<br />Link 5x PartyFlock XTC: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/acdc17c7ab

We&#039;ve mixed this speed ourselves with the up to 80% pure speed we have with paracetamol (which is perfectly safe). Painkillers like paracetemol also get mixed with ritalin (which contains amphetamines) all the time. FYI we only sniff the 50/60% pure listing ourselves, because we think the up to 80% pure speed is to heavy. This is also clearly stated on the product listings.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />First of all I would like to say that I have ordered a sample of your uncut product and fully look forward to writing a review. I was planning on buying some of your cut speed until I read this.... Paracetamol ( APAP) is not safe... far from it. It&#039;s a well documented fact that it damages the liver, it&#039;s terrible for your sinuses, and it&#039;s completely unfit for injection. It&#039;s not going to make you drop dead if you&#039;re snorting it, but overtime it will take a toll on your liver; and for me as an IV user, this product is completely unusable as it&#039;s barely even water soluble but enough so that it will get into the syringe and corrode the veins.&nbsp; Please change your cut to something like vitamin b-12 or even caffeine or powdered sugar as this is a highly unsafe cut with no advantages whatsoever; there are better, cheaper, safer alternatives to snorting tylenol... And if and when you do please let me know so I can try your weaker product! Please don&#039;t take this as a personal attack, it&#039;s just that seeing that information is troubling to say the least, and thank you for telling people what you use as an adulterant. <br /><br />Do a google search if you&#039;re having trouble believing this, and here is a quote from wikipedia: &quot;Paracetamol hepatotoxicity is, by far, the most common cause of acute liver failure in both the United States and the United Kingdom&quot;
