				For multiple reasons I prefer using SR for most things, usually pharmas, even though I can get most things cheaper locally, when they&#039;re available that is.<br /><br />Which got me to thinking.. what do you think the markup on things like painkillers, adderall, benzos are? (And other drugs as well I suppose) is? The markup on painkillers seems to be a LOT from my experience, as is the markup/profit margin on adderall.<br /><br />Any thoughts from people who know more than me/ex vendors?

For a more complex view on it:<br /><br />First one has to consider at what stage is the product processed? For example Cocaine might be processed in Colombia while Opium in Afghanistan might have to be exported a certain distance for them to be able to process it into Heroin. Now that gets us to the next stage which would be in what Region does the product come from? Cannabis grown in Colombia versus Cannabis grown in Australia who have been grown the same way will obviously not have the same prices due to a lot of factors.<br /><br />Next up we have the wholesalers who all have different prices for the most part, the markup from wholesalers to local retailers is obviously because of the risk involved - the price is set by the amount of other people who have been sent by jail more or less. The stages after this are highly customizable depending on the Region and now with the addition of Silk Road there&#039;s even more alternatives which has the potential to reduce prices even more. It has however not been able to do this in the slightest yet so far, most likely due to the fact the majority of the population aren&#039;t capable of using Silk Road for various reasons. Beyond these basics it will obviously be up to the product itself in terms of legality, popularity and ease of concealment. Now add to this mix the human factor where people are ripping people off, mixing product with crap to increase profitability and so on and it gets a mess - impossible to quantity those factors. To summarize the points that matters:<br /><br />* Does the product need processing and if so, in what Regions?<br />* Where does the product get produced and how what risks are involved in transporting it?<br />* What is the penalty of using the product in Region X?<br />* How popular is the product in Region X?<br />* How cheap is the delivery from Vendor X?<br />----------<br />I&#039;ve seen some examples on pills in general here on the forums and if we&#039;re talking about Europe in general the markup seems to be somewhere between 200 % to 400 % if they order in large quantities, depending on the Region of course. To show some concrete examples I&#039;ll list some cheap bulk listings along with Regions where that specific product is fairly expensive per unit quantifier.<br /><br />Methylone / Bulk Price: $2,3951 - $4,6625 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/97 )<br /><br />Buyer Price: <br /><br />Portugal: $14.99 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/afcfcb0a6b ) [ 321,50 % - 625,86 % margin&nbsp; ]<br />Netherlands: $17.11 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/cac594650d ) [ 366,97 % - 714,37 % margin ]<br />United States of America: $17.50 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4ab2119729 ) [ 375,33 % - 730,65 % margin ]<br />Sweden: $57.50 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/8ad6a1907d ) [ 1233,24 % - 2400,73 % margin ]<br /><br />Ketamine / Bulk Price: $15,976 - $18,849 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/59 )<br /><br />Buyer Price:<br /><br />Germany: $30.00 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/011175746c ) [ 159,15 % - 187,78 % margin ]<br />Canada: $50.00 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/b19f1099dc ) [ 265,26 % - 312,96 % margin ]<br />Sweden: $80.83 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/c390bfeea9 ) [ 428,82 % - 502,62 % margin ]<br />Australia: $155.00 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/56c28a1ca8 ) [ 822,32 % - 970,20 % margin ]<br /><br />Meth / Bulk Price: $34,89 - $50,00 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/54 )<br /><br />Buyer Price:<br /><br />United States of America: $75.00 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/dd9a7b1ced ) [ 150,00 % - 214,96 % margin ]<br />Germany: $88.22 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/32312c4266 ) [ 176,44 % - 252,85 % margin ]<br />Czech Republic: $100.00 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/68513261c9 ) [ 200,00 % - 286,61 % margin ]<br />Australia: $500.92 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/44b831176f ) [ 1001,84 % - 1435,71 % margin ]<br /><br />Cocaine / Bulk Price: $75,001 - $96,066 per gram ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/53 )<br /><br />Buyer Price: Ranging from $44,24 - $167.24 per gram. This whole category is a train wreck with scammers, wildly different purities and no consistency what so ever. I don&#039;t see how this mess could ever be sorted out short of&nbsp; a vendor destroying the competition with excellent reliability and consistency providing the entire world with product or full legalization.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are other products which give great margins in comparison but I don&#039;t have the knowledge to know which ones, perhaps someone else has some good ideas. :)

				Buy from someone that makes them theirself. Yeah its dangerous but if they have good feedback you&#039;ll usally be okay. <br />And pain pill addicts are usually willing to pay alot, small supply+large demand=high prices<br />I remember about 1.5 years ago only one or two vendors had suboxone and would sell it for 40-60 a dose. now theyre are dozens and it goes for 20-25. But addicts dont generally want that so the supply can actually be enough for the prices to go down. Theyre would need to be&nbsp; hell of alot of vendors selling &quot;real&quot; painkillers for the price to go down.<br /><br />Short answer:<br />They sell them for so much because people buy them for so much.
