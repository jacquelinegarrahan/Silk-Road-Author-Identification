				I just placed my first international order and I&#039;m a bit nervous about it. It is UK to US. Am I right to be skittish. It is a small order so losing it is not as nerve racking as ruining my recieving address

				I&#039;m pretty weary of ordering internationally as well, but that&#039;s what fake names are for.<br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered things (to Canada) from the UK before from different websites and they usually say 7 - 21 business days, and usually come in around 10

				If your name isn&#039;t on the package, all you have to do is say you have no idea what it is IF you do get in trouble<br />But from what I understand it&#039;s pretty rare that they open a package at random, the package needs to be suspicious (sounds/smells of drugs)<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the vendor you used will package it inconspicuously and you&#039;ll be fine

I will always use my real name. I have had a seized product from the UK to Canada and many following ones arrived with no trouble at all in 7-10 days. Priority and Express/EMS options arouse the most suspicion, so try to use standard mail internationally, especially with new vendors. I&#039;ve spoken to many people who&#039;ve had int&#039;l seizure in Canada and simply received a letter detailing the report of the seizure (the CBSA&#039;s protocol seems to ships back to the return address; although I&#039;m not sure where it ended up in many of the cases I&#039;ve heard). <br /><br />Again, I&#039;m sorry for apply my knowledge of Canadian importing as opposed to the US, but I can truly say that I have seen 10+ seizure letters from people importing here that got seized and only received communication as a generic letter, with the Controlled Substances Act + Schedule # that made it illegal to import, the due process for claiming a controlled substance that you are legally allowed to import, requiring the presentation of proof. From 120 day supplies of prescription pills to MDMA (1oz), ketamine (2g), heroin (7g in a chunk. I don&#039;t know what fool did that, but I can&#039;t blame Tony76 cuz he shipped within Canada). Although your own subjective reasoning may vary, all of these packages could be considered for personal use, and it would be way too much work to chase after end-users of drugs at a federal level when they are clearly not buying quantities enough to flip very much over a $1000 revenue per package. Think they&#039;re a dealer at these amounts? a distributor to friends at most.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read similar topics regarding this a while back, and the DEA is always mentioned as an agency that changes the game in the USA, as you guys have a large task force out to prosecute for drugs at almost all levels. I say use your real name, and if questioned personally or via a letter for an amount exceeding ~5 doses (estimation), you should stop using that address for imports immediately. If you are met in person, don&#039;t shoot your mouth of in over-confidence of your control over the situation. act a bit concerned, remain stable and &quot;keep it real&quot; while you talk. IF you can&#039;t do this, get a lawyer right away! I&#039;m not 100% sure, but you could freak out from a visit from the cops and use a defense of mentally delusional, or under stress from someone trying to extort you on the internet. That&#039;s for your lawyer to figure out anyway, which probly won&#039;t happen... But you gotta do your due diligence, or they&#039;ll do their&#039;s!&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Have Fun, Be Safe, and if you want benzos, check out my profile! My products are legal in many states and ship as standard lettermail to keep prices low and transit times quick. (Sorry, until my post count is 50 I&#039;m advertising my products&nbsp; :P )

However I wouldn&#039;t personally order from the netherlands, as everything I&#039;ve ordered from their has been seized. Because its a known drug producing country customs tend to pay more attention to mail from there.

The other was also nicked due to his IRL activities and not SR, he just told them all about SR after he was raided, as I said low hanging fruit.<br /><br />I am in no way saying ordering o/s isn&#039;t risky because you need to take precautions. I would say the UK to US route is reasonably safe given the volume of mail between the two and the fact the UK generally isn&#039;t flagged as drug producing country. A vendor using good stealth should avoid any issues but there are no absolutes here.<br /><br />If however I lived in the US I would have all the drugs I could possible want domestically so would have no need to risk an o/s order.<br /><br />I strongly suggest you do your research thoroughly and have safe drop arrangements.

				Apparently packaging from NL has vastly improved for the bigger vendors over the past year because of seizures. This doesn&#039;t change the fact that mail from NL is a red flag in most countries. Personally, I would pay a bit extra to order from another, less suspect country.

				Yeah the Netherlands is definitely red flagged by many countries, including the US, UK, AUS, and CAN.&nbsp; For the US, CAN is a flagged country too because of the availability of safarole oil.&nbsp; A good amount of America&#039;s MDMA comes from Canada.<br /><br />I always go domestic now.&nbsp; The only thing I&#039;ll order internationally is LSD on blotter, because it is, after all, just paper.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure every now and then an LSD shipment gets caught up, but I would be willing to bet that&#039;s due to something like a false name, incorrect address, sketchy packaging, or a watched return address.&nbsp; As long as the vendor is reputable and you use your real name and address, there shouldn&#039;t be any problems.
