				Guys im in AUS, Was starting to lean towards the idea of getting a fake driver&#039;s license and renting a PO box for my International order&#039;s. But after thinking on it a while, i have some questions. If you were to get pulled up either retrieving the package from the drop/transporting it home/Raid. If you had a parcel with an imaginary person&#039;s name on it, You have NO plausable deniability, Even if the package is unopened. So is this better then using your REAL name + Address Drop or not? I need a little info in this please !!! =D

				You won&#039;t have much plausible deniability with a real name/address either. At the very least usually police have better things to do than watch a P.O Box for hours/days hoping you show up. At your home they have plenty of options to try and fuck you.<br /><br />As for me I have a fake I.D and order medium quantities for personal/small dealing every now and then and ship to nearby Hotels under said fake name. I just show up at the front desk ask if a package has arrived, sign off, and am on my way. Hotels receive a shit-ton of mail every day for guests and business. I show up at random hours (usually late night as no employee working this shift gives the slightest fuck). I&#039;ve done this around 10 times and have even had a serious package intercepted, wasn&#039;t even worried. I&#039;m a fucking ghost this way

				dafuq is wrong with all the aussis in this forum/site?? like 80% of the ppl buying are from australia, dont you guys have normal street dealers over there? Ridiculo.<br /><br />Anyways, guy with the Hotel has a crisp way of staying anon. But typical Mossad technique, typical...<br /><br /><br />Would you rent a room in said hotel or does it work without paying anything?

It&#039;s not uncommon for packages/letters to not have room numbers. If it&#039;s not addressed to an employee or the hotel, It&#039;s assumed its for a guest. Usually you just show Id and grab the package at the front desk whenever (I&#039;ve come by a full week after delivery and it was still sitting there). Sometimes you sign if the hotel has a policy for liability purposes. But this method is the safest I&#039;ve thought of, can&#039;t imagine how a CD would go down at a hotel.

Australians have a natural fear of prison, passed on from their ancestors or some shit.

				yo cheer&#039;s for reply&#039;s guys but need more info, The hotel way is a nice idea, But i rly need to know the Benefits to using PO box under fake name VS an address with my real name. I can see everything going wrong if u get caught with the package at ANY point if it has a FAKE name on it and you have it in your possession... Where as if it was your own name and box is unopened you can just say ur picking it up because there was a card under your door or whatever the fuck. I need to know the PRO&#039;s and CON&#039;s of using fake PO box.<br /><br />And to answer your question about us Aussie&#039;s. A gram of 12%-20% coke cost&#039;s $350-$400 here on the street&#039;s.

				Hi Folks,<br />From a Vendor perspective .... Real names and addresses.<br />Best get out i&#039;ve heard is when packages arrives, mark it up with &#039; RETURN TO SENDER&#039; and leave for 3 days.<br />Feds show up , plausible deniability. After 3 days , no ones coming. Enjoy.<br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />Machine Elves
