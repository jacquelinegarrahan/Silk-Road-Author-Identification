				Hello my friends,<br /><br />I&#039;m PurpleLotus and the reason I am creating this thread is so that my customers, or just newbs with questions about my listings, could have a place to discuss all things PurpleLotus. It&#039;s unfortunate that this new policy has actually prevented some of my best customers from being able to continue to participate in my review thread on the forums. I wanted to create this area so we could continue to have discussion and help get my friends up to 50 posts by talking about something they actually might have interest in, instead of just the nonsense I see in this section which no one cares about. <br /><br />My vendor page can be found in my signature.<br /><br />My main thread can be found here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=97820.msg691682#msg691682<br />For those of you who would like to check it out.<br /><br />My main listing can be found here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/cc294943b1<br />and my HardCore collection is once again offered here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/baa353a3bc<br /><br />First newb tip, you cannot buy the HardCore collection without owning the original collection. This is done for safety reasons and in an effoert to boost overall customer success and satisfaction. No exceptions are ever made. Learned this one the hard way through experience.<br /><br />So what the hell do I sell anyway? I sell coupons which you download and can then print just like any other internet coupons and work in stores. They can be printed and used unlimited times. They are all 100% custom made, never before seen, and exclusively only sold on SilkRoad. I do expiration updates every couple of months so that they are never out of date, but also don&#039;t have a ridiculous expiration date that&#039;s way too far away. These updates are free once you have purchased my listing. I also periodically add coupons to each collection which are also free for the particular collection(s) you have purchased. For example, since the release of the Original Collection I have added over 100 new coupons which everyone who owned the collection got for free.<br /><br />Let&#039;s take a look at what&#039;s in the Original Collection, no point in listing the HC coupons, as you can&#039;t buy them without this one anyway, but if you are curious then go check out the HC listing:<br /><br />$4.25 off Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 75 count +<br />$8 off Airwick Freshmatic Starter Kit<br />$4 off Amy&#039;s product<br />$5.25 off Atkins 4-pack shakes<br />$3.25 off any Axe product<br />$5 off Bertolli Frozen Meals<br />$4 off any BIC pens<br />$9 off Bounty paper towels<br />$9.50 off any Brita Pitcher System<br />$4 off Bustelo Coffee<br />$5 off California Pizza Kitchen product<br />$4.50 off a pack of Camels any variety<br />$2 off Campbell&#039;s Chunky soup<br />$1 off Carmex<br />$3.75 off Cascade Actionpacks<br />$3.25 off Celestial Sleepy Time tea<br />$4.25 off Clorox Toilet Wand refills<br />$3.25 off any 2 Coke two liters, any variety<br />$6.75 off Cottonelle Toilet paper 12pack or larger<br />$5 off any Covergirl product<br />$3.25 off any Crest Rinse<br />$2.75 off Dixie paper plates<br />$3 off Dove Men+Care and Women&#039;s deodorant<br />$6 off any Duracell product<br />$7 off Emergen-C 30 ct. +<br />$3.25 off Febreeze Fabric Freshener<br />$3.25 off Febreeze car clips<br />$9.50 off Foodsaver Roll or Pre-Cut bags<br />$5 off Frappiccino 4 pack<br />$7.50 off Frito-Lays variety pack 20 count +<br />$4 off Gillette HydraGel shave gel<br />$8 off any Hanes product<br />$3.75 off Horizon Organic Milk<br />$10 off any Huggies product<br />$2 off Sabra Hummus<br />$6 off any 3 Hungry Man dinners<br />$10 off Kerr Mason Jars 12 pack<br />$10 off any 3 packs of Marlboro any variety<br />$5.50 off Meaty Bone dog treats<br />$9 off Mucinex<br />$8 off Myoplex Protein Shake 4 pack<br />$4 off any Oxy acne product<br />$4 off Ozarka bottled water case<br />$10 off any Pampers product<br />$9 off any Pedigree dog food<br />$7 off POM Wonderful<br />$7 off Purex detergent or ultrapaks<br />$8 off Purina Cat Chow<br />$10 off Redline Energy 4-pack<br />$6 off Renu product<br />$6.25 off any Starbucks coffee product (includes k-cups)<br />$5.50 off Swiffer wet or dry refills<br />$4.50 off Tampax tampons<br />$9.75 off Tide<br />$7.75 off Tide Pods<br />$6.50 off Trojan condoms any variety<br />$5.75 off any Tyson chicken product<br />$8 off Waggin Train dog treats<br />$2.50 off Welch&#039;s 100% Juice<br />$7.50 off Wonka candy variety bag<br />$4 off Adidas Aftershave<br />$5.25 off any 2 Ben and Jerry&#039;s pints<br />$3.25 off Darigold Eggnog<br />$4 off Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix<br />$7.50 off any 5 Green Giant frozen vegetables<br />$3 off Lindt Truffles<br />$3 off Mission Tortilla Chips<br />$5 off any 2 Mt.

If you are new, interested, and have questions, then those are certainly welcome to but I ask that you please read the descriptions of the listing before asking any questions, as it may already contain those answers. I won&#039;t force anyone to go read my official review thread, although it&#039;s filled with good info.<br /><br />PurpleLotus<br /><br />UPDATE: Meant to mention I am a newbie friendly vendor. I&#039;ll fill your order even if it is your very first SR purchase and will gladly help you the best I can. Any purchase you make from me is one you will never regret and will be satisfied with, and it&#039;s a nice way to start off with good stats here on SR.<br /><br />

				I would highly recommend purchasing PL&#039;s coupon collection.&nbsp; I have purchased it and it&#039;s saved me untold amounts.&nbsp; I wish I had the money for the Hardcore collection, but alas, I doubt I&#039;ll ever have the spare coins for that.. :/<br /><br />PL honestly goes WAY out of his way to accommodate YOU. His customer service is unparalleled.

				If anybody is on the fence, save a few coins and buy this.&nbsp; You&#039;ll recoup the cost in one shopping trip easily.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only gone through a few coupons myself as I&#039;m still getting my feet but I&#039;m planning my next couple of trips and slowly ramping up.<br /><br />BUY THESE!!<br /><br />Thinking of setting some of the savings aside to buy the HC when I&#039;m comfortable.

				Thanks for the kind words my friends!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Got some new and exciting things right around the corner! So new that I haven&#039;t even mentioned it on my official review thread yet, but one of them will be some new additions to the HC collection which will be added in very soon, and the other is something completely new offered by me which is oh-so close to being released officially and without a doubt is completely AWESOME! Not a new coupon pack, don&#039;t really have the need for that right now, my two collections are doing just fine handling the new coupon needs, but something different and never before seen. It didn&#039;t even exist as a real thing until now. <br /><br />

				NO!!!! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! I can&#039;t have you not able to post on my official review thread! You are one of the greats of all time! DAMMIT! THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT MAN!<br /><br />I promise, no more thread changes ever again, and never will I delete an old thread again. That was a huge mistake and I regret it greatly now, this whole 50 post thing is bullshit. <br /><br />Apparently this was SR&#039;s way of eliminating the spam bots which would log on and just spam up every thread with links to scam sites promising cheap coins to noobs. They also put a cap on forum PMs to 10 an hour, to stop the message spammers, but that too is inconvenient for those of us who chat a lot in forum PMs.

				Yes you can Atnas Daor Klis, no fees with member to member transferring on SR. Your wallet, that&#039;s just how they make their little bit for providing the service I guess.<br /><br />@harharhar, with the OC, and in moderation (hell you could just use self checkout with a lower amount of coupons) they basically just sell themselves.... now some people are good salesmen and just go buck wild with these, saving $150+ at a time in one trip with only OC coupons. I generally roll with about $50-75 in savings, but you can see the picture on the listing, that was taken by me of one of my trips, so it is what you make of it. Now the HC collection, as bad ass as it fucking is, you better be able to sell yourself and the coupon.

Target/Walmart, any high success spots?<br /><br />&nbsp;also, do you ever make custom coupons for a fee?&nbsp; I have this fucking cat litter, that I manf coupons for for 3$, its only 1 certain version of their brand, and its 16$ each, and they never put anything in the paper.&nbsp; I can scan the coupon I have whatever, I wanted to ask didnt want to PM you as I know how busy you vendors are... Let me know if this is even possible.&nbsp; It may even be a good one to add to the pack?<br /><br />Regardless cant wait to get this next week and see what happens at the store<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They work EXCELLENT at Target and K-Mart and I would say 95% of Walmart&#039;s but some remote Walmart&#039;s act fucking crazy and I think it might be a different type of scanner or something, but I always recommend to start off small at a new store that way you can learn if they are goig to be very accepting when you come back with a hand full of them. This is especially true with your local and regional chains although many of those work just fine, but it&#039;s something I can&#039;t test myself, so local and regional chains you just gotta read their coupon policy, so you make sure you don&#039;t do anything to break it from the start, and test a coupon or two to make sure you are g2g. If they dont accept it, they dont accept it... no worries, but it&#039;s embarrassing if you walk into a brand new store with 15 coupons and the store doesn&#039;t accept them, that&#039;s rare though at any store but I always recommend the small test run first.<br /><br />I do in fact make custom coupons... actually my last 100+ coupons added to the OC collection were either customers suggestions or selfish PurpleLotus wants this shit too coupons. Do I charge for one right away without the wait on updates and chance you won&#039;t even get your addition made since I get more than I can possibly make? I once ofered such a listing and very soon will have the same deal again, but not today. Don&#039;t worry, very soon you will be able to request your cat litter coupon and have it the same day.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				STRONGLY considering getting the original pack based on all your stellar feedback and apparent customer service... a little bummed I&#039;ll never live the hardcore life though, but c&#039;est la vie.<br />Just wondering if a few coupons were possible to be added. no rush, just curious if they could be added at some point:<br /><br />pepperridge farms bread. i like the healthy whole grain breads, but nature&#039;s own isn&#039;t sold anywhere near me.<br />some sort of pasta? like barilla. that&#039;d be nice.<br />dr. bronner&#039;s soaps.<br /><br />I mostly just shop for the essentials on a limited budget, so it&#039;ll be nice as fuck to splurge a bit (without the splurging).<br />Also, i work at a target currently. it sucks, which is part of what brought me here; your deals are better than an employee discount, after all. and would be able to answer any questions. i&#039;m not a csm or anything, but i know a bit about the coupons from a store that&#039;s pretty strict. and i won&#039;t be bringing your coupons to my store. i may be a newbie, but i&#039;m not a fool. i&#039;d PM this, but it feels like it&#039;ll be a long road to 50 posts...

				I popped my coupwning cherry last night. Gently of course. I passed 4 for a savings of $10. My coupons wouldn&#039;t scan (poor print quality and too small), after a bit of scrutiny, and a bit of sweating on my part, the cashier entered them manually.&nbsp; ;D

				Get a smartphone app which scans UPCs and gs1 databars, that way you can test them out for a positive scan before going out to the store. iPhone makes the best one called &quot;coupondecoder&quot; which will not only scan but also will break down the information contained in the coupon. Android does not have a similar app yet, but you can download barcode scanners that will atleast register the scan so you know it printed out well.

				The OC is the way to go if you don&#039;t want any attention. havent had a problem with it yet.<br />The HC however I only got 2 to pass w/o manager approval and those were just cool cashiers.<br />Those are def. eye catchers and in my experience get the manager over fairly quickly but if you stick to your story you might still get the item (Iv&#039;e had managers turn me away when that shit scanned perfectly).

				i don&#039;t think that&#039;ll work, they need the paper coupon to send to their clearinghouse or they won&#039;t get reimbursed for it...digital coupons aren&#039;t for manufacturer coupons like PL&#039;s, they are usually only store coupons that aren&#039;t actually worth anything and don&#039;t get sent away for $$

				On the main thread, it looks like people are discussing target returns with coupons. I&#039;ll contribute my two cents since I work there, although I dunno if this&#039;ll make it across to the other board...<br /><br />yes, targets are fishy on people returning lots of items that are assumed to have been purchased with coupons. BUT here&#039;s the catch (at least at my store, which I mentioned is pretty strict)-- bullseye won&#039;t do anything about these returns. that&#039;s right, not even assets protection cares about this problem, and neither does target.<br /><br />the reason for this, i&#039;ve been told, is that target makes all of its money back from the manufacturers on the coupons, so they don&#039;t care and wouldn&#039;t do anything about this problem until there&#039;s a loss from it.<br /><br />what target doesn&#039;t know, is that people could be returning items purchased with some purplelotus coupons.<br /><br />now, usually you&#039;ll only be refunded the amount that you actually paid for the item. here&#039;s the catch though, and follow closely: pay for the items with a visa or american express gift card, using all your PL coupons too. when you want to return your items, tell them you lost the receipt, but that you paid with a gift card, asking if they can look it up on there. the less you act you know about target&#039;s policy and system for this, the more innocent you&#039;ll seem. finally, when you return the items, the entire amount (coupon value + what you paid) should be refunded to the gift card that you originally used to pay. i&#039;ve seen this work for people a lot, and they weren&#039;t even using fake coupons, as far as i know. coop + gc = profits

				These coupons saved my life. I was barely able to pay all my bills and eat before I bought this coupon set from PL, and now I actually have money in my pocket to spare. I have probably saved at least $1000 or more in just a few months, and I&#039;m probably underestimating that. Seriously, if you buy anything off of SR you should buy these coupons. It will pay for itself, and probably cover some other buys on here as well. Thank You Purple Lotus, you are the man!

				Ok, the next big thing goes on sale tomorrow, but it&#039;s fully operational and I am releasing it now so that you can all play with it. Anyone can visit the site and guests can use all of the features and do full previews. you simply need an account and credits to finalize your work once you like how it looks!<br /><br />Welcome to &quot;The Coupon Club!&quot;<br /><br />Conceptualized by PurpleLotus and made into a reality by web designer extraordinaire Klipp<br /><br />The world&#039;s first coupon generating .onion website! Capable of making a coupon the quality of any that PurpleLotus makes in less than 10 minutes with just a little input from the user. You need a product image to upload, an optional watermark if you choose, and also the infamous first 5 digits of the UPC we all are use to by now. You select the expiration date and also the amount you want off followed by the coupon text such as &quot;of any (1) bottle of Coke&quot;.<br /><br />At the moment it is only capable of amounts up to $10 off. We have many plans for future features and upgrades but we are finally, after months of work, ready to release the first version for public consumption.<br /><br />http://couponerpcuhkcyn.onion/

				Great product/service you have here!&nbsp; You&#039;re also definitely building customers with the newbie thread.<br /><br />I apologize if you&#039;ve answered this before, but do these work with self-checkout scanners?<br />Seems like it&#039;d be a nice way to dodge suspicious cashiers.<br /><br />Also:&nbsp; is it possible that these might work anywhere online?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never thought about buying most of these every-day goods through a site, but I know Amazon and other places offer groceries and stuff.<br /><br />Good luck on your new site!<br />

				Thank you for this PL.<br /><br />I went to Chick-fil-a, and they gladly accepted the coupon. Later, I went to Walmart and saved $18.00 on three items.<br /><br />Question though, where are the other fast food coupons that people speak of? I only see the Chick-fil-a one in my OC, and the gift card ones in the HC. I don&#039;t see any other restaurant coupons in either. Thanks.<br /><br />Another question, does self-checkout at Walmart have a coupon limit before signaling a manager?<br /><br />First post!

				The Walmart thing, once you make it to the real forum thread they have some masters at it in there, but I wanted to say any amount of coupons over like $25 total in savings needs the lady to come enter her code, but she gives the least fuck about her job anyway, that&#039;s why she is the self checkout attendant. I personally like to deal with cashiers.

				I&#039;d also like to add that w/o this coupon pack, I could&#039;ve NEVER made my amazing New Years Eve happen.&nbsp; Bought the pack a lil over a week before NYE, crushed on the original pack until I felt comfortable using the coupons, and then stepped up to the HC pack.&nbsp; Instead of sticking around my hometown for some lame Dubstep event, I was able to....<br /><br />- Fly halfway across the country last-minute to surprise all my homies I haven&#039;t seen in years, showing up out of nowhere to see a band I&#039;ve been touring around the country to for since &#039;03.&nbsp; Just seeing the look on their faces when they saw me, thinking that I wasn&#039;t going to make it, was worth the price alone :)<br />- Throw more-than-necessary amounts of gas in everyone&#039;s tanks who gave me rides<br />- Order pizza for the crew on multiple occasions<br />- Treat the promoter who hooked me up w/ a last-minute press passes and box stickies to $200 in airfare giftcards (I&#039;ve been assured I&#039;m covered on passes to whatever I make it back for in the future as well), which I scooped outside the fucking venue an hour before the show w/ about a mile of foot travel.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry, he was informed of the necessary details, and won&#039;t use them to fly in artists just in case lol :)<br />- Stock up the hotel and supply the entire crew w/ all-you-can-eat/drink <br />--- Ice Cream<br />--- POM Juice<br />--- Red Bull<br />--- Dixie cups (shot glasses duh)<br />--- Yogurt<br />--- Sun Chips<br />--- Coke (soda dummy, even PL isn&#039;t good enough to fool a SR vendor into taking a coupon)<br />--- Febreeze (to cover up the smell of multi-night hotel raging)<br /><br />THIS WAS ALL FREE FROM THE COUPONS - OVER $1000 SAVED IN TOTAL!<br /><br />Still pretty astounded at it all, can&#039;t thank you enough for not only making my, but all of my homies&#039;, NYE PL!

				And did I mention PL&#039;s coupons got me about $25 of groceries for ($2)?&nbsp; I asked what their cash back policy was and they told me that if I pay with debit, they will credit my card.&nbsp; I opted to pay with...nothing.&nbsp; I told them the giant Corporation that runs Walgreens needs the $2 worse than I do.<br /><br />For anyone on the fence about PL coupons, consider this.&nbsp; I&#039;m cleaning my store&#039;s tyson chicken out and paying less than $10 out-the-door.&nbsp; I suck at HC coupons, though.&nbsp; So I&#039;m hardly an exceptional case.&nbsp; I just look for sales and even if I don&#039;t, there&#039;s usually 70%+ off my total grocery bill.&nbsp; In comparing the ease of use that the OC brings with the $40 it costs, you&#039;d be hard pressed to find anyone who could argue with that deal.&nbsp; Deal of the century, it is!!

				Haha just got a craving for fruit rollups. Unfortanately, my riteaid and cvs didn&#039;t have them. No worries though! I used my local supermarket which had them in the variety pack. I&#039;m sure the coupon PL made would&#039;ve scanned but haha the cashier didn&#039;t even scan it. Just input the dollar amount on the coupon to take off. Got them like 60% off. I love that victorious feeling after using these coupons.

				I just got back from a run with my brother to Walmart.&nbsp; We grabbed nearly identical carts except for&nbsp; a few items and split up for payment.&nbsp; He went through a traditional line and I decided to try the self checkout to see if this method would be preferred in the future. We both rounded out our carts with 2 non-coupon hobby items that were $3.95 each that we intend to re-sell in bulk later to recoup cost just to make sure we were not too close to a negative balance.&nbsp; My brother had perfect success with the Subway Gift Card, Tilamook cheese, Hanes Shirts, 4-pack Monster Energy Drinks, Bic Mechanical Pencils, Bounty Towel 6-Pack, 8-Pack Duracell Battery, Coffee-mate Creamer, Starbucks Coffee and the 2- $3.99 items for our non-coupon items.&nbsp; He did have to speak with a CSM but we were expecting that scenario to happen eventually and it went over extremely well.&nbsp; He just chatted up this middle-aged female cashier and CSM.&nbsp; After some short confusion as to why the CSM was necessary, the CSM realized that it was because the savings was over $50.&nbsp; Once this was realized, the CSM then made the error go away and she was on her way.&nbsp; <br /><br />I instantly ran into problems when my coffee creamer wouldn&#039;t scan.&nbsp; The self-checkout supervisor came over and manually input the UPC after unsuccessfully trying herself a few times.&nbsp; I successfully rang up the remaining groceries and then proceeded to scan my coupons.&nbsp; The California Pizza and Tilamook Cheese scanned perfect as usual (probably 5 times each) and the Coffee-mate creamer also scanned perfect on my first try.&nbsp; The Hanes shirts, Duracell, Bic Pens, Monster Energy, Cheez-it&#039;s and Subway Gift Card all told me to wait for assistance.&nbsp; Again the supervisor came to assist me and she was unable to successfully find what the source of the problem was.&nbsp; She then sought out the assistance of her immediate superior.&nbsp; He came over and attempted to scan the coupons.&nbsp; He tried the Subway Gift Card first and was unable to figure out why it wouldn&#039;t work.&nbsp; He took the coupon with him towards the electronics section appearing to seek out his boss for help.&nbsp; He came back, about 10 minutes later and tried again using another method and still failed.&nbsp; He then apologized and said he could take it if it scanned properly.&nbsp; While waiting for roughly ten minutes for the CSM to find his manager for guidance, I had seen my brother complete his transaction waiting from a distance.&nbsp; I had sent him a text to inquire on his success and he had quickly responded on his 100% success.&nbsp; Due to this knowledge, I knew I could successfully have these items scanned at a traditional register.&nbsp; Once the CSM left and it was just myself and the self checkout supervisor I directed her as to which items I would be removing from this purchase and trying in a traditional line.&nbsp; So my self checkout consisted of creamer, cheese and pizza which totaled out at $4.76.&nbsp; The supervisor then offered to take me to her stand and finish assisting me.&nbsp; My second order had Hanes, Duracell, Bic Pens, Monster Energy, Cheez-it&#039;s as well as my 2- $3.99 items.&nbsp; I had accidently left the Subway card in the hands of the CSM so I missed out on trying that one but all of the other coupons worked except for the Cheez-it&#039;s which I had accidentally grabbed the wrong size but still wanted to eat Cheez-it&#039;s when stoned later.&nbsp; This came out to $7.72.&nbsp; &nbsp; Between my brother and I, we spent $20.66 with a savings of $96.93.&nbsp; If I hadn&#039;t left my Subway card with the CSM, we would have saved an additional $15.&nbsp; My brother and I laughed our asses off on our drive home when we realized based on sales tax, $18 of the $20.66 we had spent was on the 4- $3.99 hobby items which we intend to resell to recoup the cost (Going to make a coupon for them soon when I can afford more BTC).&nbsp; We had gone there with the hopes of scoring on Visa and other gift cards and failed terribly due to the minimal inventory this particular store carried.&nbsp; We had also hoped to get the HP printer which according to the Walmart site showed would likely be free but was $14 after coupon at this location so we passed.&nbsp; <br /><br />My brother and I concluded from our experience that in the future we will likely just stick to the cashiers since every employee at every location we have tried PL&#039;s coupons has been nothing but apologetic about any delays, errors or miss-scans.&nbsp; There has been zero hesitation due to them thinking PL&#039;s coupons aren&#039;t authentic.&nbsp; My brother and I both project a lot of confidence in all areas of our lives so we have treated couponing no different.&nbsp; Most Walmart/Grocery employees don&#039;t work these jobs because they are confident, analytical individuals trying to climb the corporate ladder by saving the corporation a few dollars.&nbsp; We go in strong with a game plan of what we will say to a CSM regarding how we acquired each of our coupons if asked.&nbsp; We always treat all of the employees with respect and generally converse with the cashiers about subjects other then shopping or couponing.&nbsp; So far in the less than a month of PL&#039;s original coupons and 1 test run with the hardcore coupons, we have saved roughly $600 and averaged close to 85% off our couponing trips.<br /><br />Thanks again PL for the legit coupons and look forward to having some spare money to convert to BTC so I can make some amazing coupons for items to re-sell online as well as have the store pay us to take.

				Since I have began reading PL&#039;s reviews on the SR forums, I have read through probably 150+ pages of positive reviews and constant customer care by the team.&nbsp; Unfortunately most of those have been deleted.&nbsp; The new coupon site does appear to give a free sample every Friday.&nbsp; With such as reasonably low price, every day people don&#039;t buy the Original Collection they are losing money they could be spending on fun things like drugs, guns and alcohol instead of paper products and other dumb shit you probably hate buying.&nbsp; Can&#039;t go wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hey everyone. How&#039;s my money savin&#039;, wally world screwin&#039; friends doin&#039;? I hope all is well.<br />&nbsp;I know that I have written a few posts in the past praising PL&#039;s work, but I never really have gone into much detail. I really get distracted by the kids, tv, and wife buzzin in my ear, to work my way thru the haze of the last 3 or 4 bowls enough to the point where I can get those few lines out.<br />So, now that all&#039;s quiet lemme share a little with ya. It&#039;s just another of many success stories you read on here.<br />I&#039;ve purchased all of PL&#039;s collections about a year ago. They looked awesome, and I said what the hell, even if there wasn&#039;t the promised support, I should be able to make my money back before they expired. So, I purchased the original collection. <br />After downloading from the skillfully provided link, I saw what looked like quality coupons. I was amazed at the savings amounts on each coupon. So intrigued by this whole coupon idea, I began chatting with PL, and doing a lot of reading about couponing, both using, and creation. After reading, and chatting with PL, I purchased his HC collection. All of this within a few hours, and even before printing out my first one to try.<br />He pointed me out to an app that read his coupons to tell ya if it was valid or not. This was very handy, because at first things were a bit iffy. It all had to do with what type of reader the stores in your area used. So the knowledge of which ones scanned by which store helped out enormously. Think of it this way, I knew EXACTLY which coupons to take to which store.<br />The first trip out, I only used 4 coupons. I paid something like $.19 tax, and walked out the door. I can&#039;t remember exactly what the 4 where, but I do remember drinking Starbuck&#039;s the next morning.<br />Anyways, each month, our household goes thru about $600.00 of food, and another 3-400.00 cleaning/misc. items. This was about all that we could afford. Can you imagine now, armed with these coupons, our family has the option in life to afford something more than cheap single ply hard as sandpaper toilet paper. Our bunns thank you PL!!! :D<br />I have had success with the hc collection. Today, I hit up for 2 of the 50 visa&#039;s. Thanks for buyin the family chinese buffet for my family PL!<br />I hope that this has been some insight to what PL has done for us.<br /><br />Also, my original doubts about continued support...............<br />EVERY one of my collections have full PL support, and have from day one.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks again my man. My wife say&#039;s God Bless.

				Thanks TrinityHex,<br /><br />You are helping me out just the same way I have for you and I appreciate the hell out of it. I&#039;m glad you have done well and you got to have a nice dinner with the family. I&#039;ve been having somewhat of a tough time too, and got to see my family tonight and it made all the difference in the world to me. I&#039;m truly proud to be a part of this thing.<br /><br />@tr0gd0r: lol no, no worries about the man who gave you a tough look. Some people excell at self checkout, while others love the interaction with a real cashier. I&#039;m a real cashier person myself, but self checkout works wonders for others.

				@ PL: I did see a coupon of yours that should at least indulge my love for firearms a little and it is much appreciated.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went on a trip to a different Walmart than I went to yesterday.&nbsp; A close friend went with us since he was broke and needed a birthday present for his girlfriend and she has been begging for a Keurig for months and friends just don&#039;t let friends pay full-price.&nbsp; He purchased a Keurig Coffee Machine and got it for a total of $35.&nbsp; He was also successful with the Duracell as well.&nbsp; He did have to speak with a CSM who went off to most likely check on validity of the coupon.&nbsp; He eventually came back and approved the purchase.&nbsp; It ended up the cashier hadn&#039;t even tried the coupon but was surprised at the high value and had alerted the CSM&nbsp; before trying.&nbsp; The CSM apologized to my friend for the inconvenience that had been caused by the cashier.&nbsp; <br /><br />I again was unsuccessful with the Subway coupon while my brother enjoyed success ten registers down.&nbsp; The coupon scanned correctly for me and she gave me my total bill of $32.&nbsp; Included in my cart was a $15 Subway GC, Duracell batteries, Hanes boxers, Bounty paper towels, Coffee-mate creamer and a $30 GC that wasn&#039;t a coupon-ed item.&nbsp; When she opened the register after taking my money, an error popped up saying that the Subway GC hadn&#039;t activated correctly.&nbsp; Unfortunately the cashier said she could do nothing more which I knew was not true but this woman was not a native-English speaker and I was in a rush and couldn&#039;t afford to wait 15 minutes for a CSM to try and figure it out.&nbsp; After the women handed me my change back, I quickly realized she had forgotten to remove the $15 coupon for the gift card despite no longer having it in my purchase.&nbsp; This actually worked out best for me, since we already had several of the Subway GC in the wallet.&nbsp; My brother had 100% success again.&nbsp; His cashier did the same thing that happened to our friend.&nbsp; Before scanning any of the coupons, she called over for a CSM to assist.&nbsp; According to the CSM they have had some issues with fake coupons due to &quot;extreme coupon TV shows&quot;.&nbsp; He did speak to 3 total managers but he didn&#039;t care at all.&nbsp; His take consisted of Coffee-mate creamer, Hanes shirts, Subway GC and a&nbsp; $30 GC (non-coupon).&nbsp; His total was $33.&nbsp; We considered this very successful since we already buy 2- $30 cards every month at our house for phones.&nbsp; Going on another run to some other locations we haven&#039;t tried yet and will make sure to post results.&nbsp;

				Man, if you think Walmart is fun, you have got to try Target and even better K-Mart. I don&#039;t even think they have CSMs, and only at Target have I ever spoken to a manager but twice, out of 2 years of shopping.<br /><br />The HC coupons are different, but I&#039;d say I personally have a 75% success rate with the large ones.

				My life is transformed; the roll continues. I hit a new WalMart and got just under $25 worth of PL coupons through the self-checkout, w/o any need for CSM or anyone&#039;s approval. <br /><br />The only hitch was the damned coupon bin being too full for me to insert my coupons past the sensor. Self-checkout silliness like this is yet another reason that it&#039;s really preferable to use a real live (and usually too distracted to care) cashier.<br /><br />Not that there is any reason NOT to use self-checkout, if you really don&#039;t feel comfortable w/ a real cashier. With the full-coupon-bin and other non-PL problems I&#039;ve had there, none of the extra attention I may have received has ever gotten me in any trouble. And in all but one or two transactions, the self-checkout attendant easily and readily overrode any problem. Those folks key in their override codes so quickly that their fingers look blurred and the individual key &#039;beeps&#039; merge into a single tone.<br /><br />Either way, self-checkout or real Wally cashier, PL is leading the faithful out of the full-price Babylon and into 80-90% discount Paradise. Praise be to purplelotus!

				And the really lucrative benefit of experience with real cashiers using the OC, is that it gives even shy people the confidence to wade into the HC.<br /><br />This weekend I got a $20 Domino&#039;s gc from Rite-Aid and two $15 Wendy&#039;s gc&#039;s from a small regional grocery. W00t!<br /><br />It&#039;s not as easy as the OC. You have to wait maybe 30-45 seconds longer. LOL The Rite-Aid cashier kid even said something about &quot;there&#039;s no such thing as a $20 coupon.&quot; And moments later his manager keyed in her override code. In and out in under two minutes, $20 richer. :D<br /><br />I won&#039;t even say you need to &quot;just keep your cool.&quot; It isn&#039;t Checkpoint Charlie. It&#039;s just a retail store. Just look like a retail customer, which is exactly what you already look like. Be polite and patient and you&#039;ll walk out a winner.

				And once my bitcoins finally get in from the slow boat from Dwolla, I&#039;m getting the 10 + 1 Generator package and tipping PL at least a BTC or two. <br /><br />I&#039;ve netted over $400 in goods in less then a month. And that&#039;s after deducting gas cost (I live in the middle of nowhere, 100 miles from a town with a Target or Kohl&#039;s) and the cost of both the OC and the HC. <br /><br />I know it sounds a bit cultish, but purplelotus has truly changed my life.

				Hello All- I have been on here for a year but have mostly just read and only posted a couple of times and am actually a pretty new buyer as well, due to being skeptical about the whole SR thing. I felt compelled to write today about PL because the service, communication and product are second to none. These coupons are going to help my family and I get through a bit of a lean time and for that I will always be thankful, my sincere thanks go to you PL and if you are considering buying from PL, get off here now and do yourself a favor and ORDER NOW!<br /><br />I am new to this so welcome any advice, pointers or whatever else you have to offer. This is a very good thing that is going on and is helping me a substantial deal in keeping the quality of life good during a slow economic time for us.

No one is ever arrested for simply using fake coupons... there is no way to prove they knew anything. People use fake coupons all the time without even knowing they are fakes. It is a completely unprosecuted crime, and none of my customers or anyone else has had any trouble at all with the law. Unless you can find a case where these people used $20,000 in one weekend at the SAME store, using a inside man in the store and multiple people passing him the coupons... well, yeah, they got caught and didn&#039;t have any plausible deniabilty. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you plan to purchase these, and I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned about stores changing their entire system anytime soon. Even if Walmart did change every system across the nation, stores like K-Mart, etc, aren&#039;t going to follow suit right away and I doubt Walmart is making that move anytime soon so you will definitely get your values worth... but you are correct, one day they will change this shit up on us.

				@ kycuong: If you look at those anti-counterfeiting websites they are a joke.&nbsp; Almost all of their coupons they are posting as recently found counterfeits have already expired.&nbsp; The system as it currently exists is one where it takes weeks or more for the coupons to make the trip to the clearinghouses.&nbsp; The stores then have to get notified that they will not be reimbursed for the coupons and in order to really shut down a particular coupon it has to be costing the stores enough money to train their employees to spot that particular coupon and then actually care about saving their employer money.&nbsp; Luckily for us, PL makes updates on coupons as people report issues and is continually adding new coupons.&nbsp; Now it is even possible to make our own personalized coupons that nobody else will be using.&nbsp; Both stores and manufactures have a common interest in continuing to use coupons for tax reasons as well as for marketing purposes.&nbsp; They may try to improve their system but even if they overhaul their systems, someone will find a way to exploit the vulnerabilities.&nbsp; You are really only trying to sneak one over on a Walmart employee.&nbsp; Not exactly a daunting task.&nbsp; These employees will focus more of their loss prevention in traditional theft which is easy to do and more convict-able.&nbsp; <br /><br />@ White 0ut: I use 7-10 on a lot of my trips but have been just scoping new places so far.&nbsp; I plan to use 15-20 in the future using a combination of OC/HC and onion credit generated coupons and will be trying to keep my total cost between $10-15.&nbsp; In order to convict, they have to show intent.&nbsp; Enough intent that not one juror could believe any plausible excuse you gave for the coupons.&nbsp; It is not your responsibility to prove innocence, it is theirs to prove guilt.&nbsp; My brother and I have a great lawyer.&nbsp; As the show breaking bad says &quot;You don&#039;t want a criminal lawyer... you want a criminal lawyer.&quot;&nbsp; Not really necessary for PL&#039;s coupons but if you&#039;re someone worried about the law, it can&#039;t hurt for other situations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately I didn&#039;t make any trips to go shopping today since I was just recovering from a long night of mdma and drinking.&nbsp; Hopefully I can get a chance to try 2-3 stores tomorrow evening and will report any new findings.&nbsp;

				@JackChurchill How has your success at walmart been? I feel like with the self checkouts you could own the place. I mean can I get 2--$ worth of stuff, and use and scan all my coupons there? Im not too concerned with personell especially around my dumbass population. Also on the HR what have you used with success..

				I have only used the self-checkout lines twice; once at a regional store and then most recently at Walmart.&nbsp; Both times I needed assistance from a supervisor.&nbsp; At the regional store, everything worked except for the Tide Pods and that was because I had grabbed the wrong size and when the lady was assisting me she read the stipulation so I left the item out.&nbsp; She was very friendly, and apologetic over their machine giving me trouble.&nbsp; I noticed that in yesterdays trip to Walmart the only coupons that needed supervisor assistance were items that were paying me to take them.&nbsp; I have only had hardcore collection for a week, and unfortunately the two places I have tried to find the Visa GC&#039;s have had a really limited supply of cards.&nbsp; The Subway GC is 2/4 so far but one of the times that it &quot;failed&quot;, the card didn&#039;t activate so she refunded my money for the gift card despite not removing the $15.00 off coupon.&nbsp; It ended up she gave me an additional $15 savings which was much better for me.&nbsp; Since we already had two Subway GC&#039;s, we already had enough to get our friends Subway later that day and preferred the cash in hand.&nbsp; The Keurig coupon worked and my friend was able to get his girlfriend the present she really wanted for $35.&nbsp; We will probably try the xbox 360 coupon as well as some of the game coupons this week since it should be all be free at Walmart.&nbsp; My car is broken at the moment so I have needed to borrow a friends car for trips which has slowed my trips to try the hardcore collection.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have the BitCoin&#039;s yet to buy the generator credits but will be doing so as soon as I possibly can.&nbsp; I plan to make coupons for items that I can easily re-sell online that will pay me take them, so that I can freely choose items such as produce or meat that don&#039;t have coupons.&nbsp; I have really enjoyed the Duracell, Bic, Bounty and Pizza Rolls since they pay you to take them which allows for you to keep that receipt low.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				@ White Out: Ya, it is super easy.&nbsp; Any problems I have encountered were not in a manner where I was being looked at as a guilty party.&nbsp; They were simply seeing if they could accept the coupon or not.&nbsp; These employees are not trying to break open a 5 o&#039;clock new story, they are simply trying not to get yelled at by their superiors for not following a the company policy which they are likely less familiar with than you should be.&nbsp; Just read the coupon policy for the the store you are going to so you don&#039;t look like an idiot and get flustered and act really strange.&nbsp; Although I am sure the self-checkout could be exploited very well, I have realized that with they type of savings I am looking to get, I will have to likely talk to somebody so I might as well just go to a regular cashier who will normally just take care of any issues with the OC coupons without having ever needed a manager for those.&nbsp; Just be friendly and converse about something natural.&nbsp; Most people hate talking about their shitty jobs, so try and find something more interesting than groceries to talk with them about and it might help you out in the long run.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />@ XyankeedoodleX: You can use cash or Visa gift Cards.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use anything that traces back to you.&nbsp; I do have a regional store&#039;s savings card that I filled out using fake info.&nbsp; I only use the card a few times and then I can get another one for free.&nbsp; The coupons are not discovered to not be authentic until they arrive at the clearinghouse that pays the stores for their coupons.&nbsp; Stores such as Walmart just throw their coupons into a bin and bundle them together at the end of their shift.&nbsp; You likely have a few weeks minimum before the store would have any idea a coupon didn&#039;t pay them back.&nbsp; Compared to traditional theft, coupon theft is relatively low and much harder to stop, which means it costs them more money.&nbsp; Most likely stores are not going to train their employees on not taking a particular coupon unless the use is so prolific that said training would in fact save them more money than the employees time costs.&nbsp; <br /><br />@ kycuong: Glad you liked it.&nbsp; It&#039;s just important to know your rights.&nbsp; Many people don&#039;t understand the rights they have, so they don&#039;t notice when they are being taken away.&nbsp;

				PL collections are priceless to anyone on the silk road.&nbsp; The Original Collection is intuitive. Know your coupon policy and you will be fine and many $$$ richer.&nbsp; Walmart has no limit to the number of coupons you use per transaction.&nbsp; This has allowed me to walk out with 50+ cans campbell in one go and getting paid to take them.&nbsp; You can stay on the self checkout and do several items or walk out with hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise for next to free.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember my first run was a self checkout order at kroger after ringing it all up to the total was well over 300.&nbsp; Looking back this was ridiculous because for any large order at kroger you should always use a real cashier, the reason being that I&#039;d you use any coups at the self check out they prompt for a customer service rep to scan all of them anyway. Point of the story got a woman who knew nothing about coupon policy, she asked and all of my order was approved.&nbsp; My total price was around $28.xx<br /><br />Needless to say I had nothing boring but respect for PL and RX work and had nothing but confidence in using them.

How&#039;s my money savin&#039;, wally world screwin&#039; friends doin&#039;? I hope all is well.<br />&nbsp;I know that I have written a few posts in the past praising PL&#039;s work, but I never really have gone into much detail. I really get distracted by the kids, tv, and wife buzzin in my ear, to work my way thru the haze of the last 3 or 4 bowls enough to the point where I can get those few lines out.<br />So, now that all&#039;s quiet lemme share a little with ya. It&#039;s just another of many success stories you read on here.<br />I&#039;ve purchased all of PL&#039;s collections about a year ago. They looked awesome, and I said what the hell, even if there wasn&#039;t the promised support, I should be able to make my money back before they expired. So, I purchased the original collection. <br />After downloading from the skillfully provided link, I saw what looked like quality coupons. I was amazed at the savings amounts on each coupon. So intrigued by this whole coupon idea, I began chatting with PL, and doing a lot of reading about couponing, both using, and creation. After reading, and chatting with PL, I purchased his HC collection. All of this within a few hours, and even before printing out my first one to try.<br />He pointed me out to an app that read his coupons to tell ya if it was valid or not. This was very handy, because at first things were a bit iffy. It all had to do with what type of reader the stores in your area used. So the knowledge of which ones scanned by which store helped out enormously. Think of it this way, I knew EXACTLY which coupons to take to which store.<br />The first trip out, I only used 4 coupons. I paid something like $.19 tax, and walked out the door. I can&#039;t remember exactly what the 4 where, but I do remember drinking Starbuck&#039;s the next morning.<br />Anyways, each month, our household goes thru about $600.00 of food, and another 3-400.00 cleaning/misc. items. This was about all that we could afford. Can you imagine now, armed with these coupons, our family has the option in life to afford something more than cheap single ply hard as sandpaper toilet paper. Our bunns thank you PL!!! :D<br />I have had success with the hc collection. Today, I hit up for 2 of the 50 visa&#039;s. Thanks for buyin the family chinese buffet for my family PL!<br />I hope that this has been some insight to what PL has done for us.<br /><br />Also, my original doubts about continued support...............<br />EVERY one of my collections have full PL support, and have from day one.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks again my man. My wife say&#039;s God Bless.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Figured this post deserves a bump. If Trinity still follows this, can you share some of your research findings? anything about the different systems, the process the coupons go through... figured it would be insightful for the newb thread, or the other thread, or pm me&nbsp; 8)

				Been using the OC for a while to get my feet wet with fantastic results. Only had one minor issue with the redbull coupon which the CSM apologized for repeatedly. A week ago I dove into the HC, this was a new ball game.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually well dressed because of my line of work and have the gift of gab so I decided to test out the PS3 coupon and was shot down by a CSM of year nominee at BB, this guy was ridiculous but very polite. I get paid to argue for a living so I can be firm without being an outright asshole. IMO it&#039;s better to be firm than just give up when a dispute happens and I feel it makes you seem legit and adds credibility to your story. I insisted I speak to someone else regarding this and after 5-10 minutes met his boss. Despite the CSM&nbsp; running for employee of the year his boss (forget his title) couldn&#039;t be bothered to give a shit and just typed something in, apologized, told the CSM to just do some inside lingo shit in the future. AHH the future.... that was going to be an hour later. Had my gf go back about an hour later and get it approved by the same CSM. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how many of PLs customers are female but I suspect 99.9% male. Try to twist things up. A personal favorite of mine is to use my gf to get the things I or we want from the HC.

Sex sells, it&#039;s so much easier for a hot girl to dress in skin tight jeans, nice tan stomach showing a belly button ring, tits hanging out, flirty personality than it is for me. The key to this is pick out a male worker preferably one that doesn&#039;t get pussy or respect for assistance at these stores like WM or KM. Start to flirt with them, ask what games they like etc. Everytime she goes HC shopping she has had success.

I agree on all counts. Be firm, but not an asshole. You presumably went through some length to get these coupons (hours of surveys, or whatever story you use that provides plausible deniability) and it is more likely for you to argue your case than just accept that they cannot be redeemed. The only exception is when the store&#039;s policy forbids it (i.e. does not accept FREE gift card coupons, does not accept any coupon over $50, etc.) - While a minimum wage worker likely doesn&#039;t give two shits about accepting coupons, they certainly don&#039;t want to get in trouble themselves, and if they break store policy, that&#039;s putting their own ass on the line.<br /><br />For all of my coupon club members, I&#039;ve got some exciting additions lines up for next Friday. I don&#039;t want to give too much away, but I&#039;m certain you will all be pleased with the enhancements!<br /><br />As always, if anyone has any trouble with the generator, or suggestions, comments, etc., please shoot me a PM on here or on SR.

				Still reading this forum and haven&#039;t decided to buy from PL yet? Well consider this:&nbsp; I made 2 trips to target yesterday.&nbsp; The first trip&#039;s items rang up as $1,356.12; I paid $98.39. The second trip&#039;s total before coupons was $1,021.40.&nbsp; After coupons?&nbsp; $23. Yes, you read that correctly: 23 fucking dollars. My calculator tells me I saved $2,256.13 yesterday. I would have gotten more but there was absolutely no more room in the carts. I asked the cashier, &quot;Why even bother scanning all this? Next time I&#039;ll just give you a wave as I push my carts out the door&#039;.&nbsp; She laughed, but knew I wasn&#039;t joking. <br /><br />I had to go buy a big ass upright freezer for this shit, and buddy, it&#039;s about to burst. I found that the door holds 50 pints of Ben and Jerry&#039;s. Its beautiful; Took a picture of it. Hung it on my new freezer.<br /><br />I loaded some coins for tips for PL, then&nbsp; I saw the Couponer&#039;s Club and I got all swolled up in ma&#039; britches.&nbsp; :o&nbsp; Better to spend it there; PL gets paid, Target gets slayed. Bertolli gets made.<br /><br />Not buying?&nbsp; Foolish.<br /><br />Muchas Gracias PurpleLotus<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have a couple questions.&nbsp; First off for PurpleLotus how does the coupon generator work exactly.&nbsp; Is one credit equal to one coupon and are you still maxing out coupons at $10 for the generator.&nbsp; Also has anyone had success with the southwest gift cards and if so where.&nbsp; I really want to get on the gift card game from the HC collection so if anyone has had success let me know what kind of paper you used to print the gc coupons and which retailers you went to.

				I tried the food saver coupons today at walmart,the roll one is fine but the HC one did not work. I got an excuse saying it wasn&#039;t a &quot;manufacturer coupon&quot; and it had no expiration date. I can&#039;t get on to SR to see if the packs are updated but that was an issue.

				Alright so I went on a nice little trip with the coupons with my roommate today. I started out at Walmart just to grab a few things and to try out a giftcard coupon at self checkout. I went up with a $10 Burger King card and as soon as I scanned it, assistance was needed to activate the card. I also showed the self checkout worker the coupon, which I now realize I probably didn&#039;t need to do, and she looked at it a bit then scanned it and I walked away with a free giftcard. At the same time, my roommate went to another self checkout station and got 3 things of orange juice, a couple frozen pizzas, and a bag of Tyson chicken strips for under $5 with no problems.<br /><br />After Walmart, we decided to head over to Kmart to go for a Subway giftcard. When I brought it up to the register, the cashier looked at it for a moment, was about to call over a manager, then was like fuck it lemme just try to scan it. It wouldn&#039;t scan so he gave me the gift card and coupon and told me to go over the customer service area. While walking over, I noticed that the barcodes for the coupon and card didn&#039;t match but decided to head over to customer service anyways. Over there, the worker looked at it then went over and took down a paper on the wall with a picture of the $175 off an RCA tv coupon from the hc pack and explained how they don&#039;t accept those kinds of coupon. She was pretty smart and noticed that the expiration dates on the two coupons were exactly the same and so were the addresses that it said to send to. I was a little surprised to see that the expiration dates on many of the hc coupons are the same since I know most of the dates on the oc coupons are different. Anyways, I probably won&#039;t be going back to that Kmart to use any hc coupons, at least for a while.<br /><br />After the failure at Kmart I went across the street to CVS and picked up a $20 Dominos giftcard. After the cashier scanned it, the register prompted for manager approval so she just reached around the corner and grabbed a key and approved the coupon and I walked out with the free giftcard.<br /><br />So, it was a pretty successful run. Saved about $60 in 30 minutes. My only suggestion for you, PL, is that you change up the expiration dates on each HC coupon the next time you update them. If you haven&#039;t already bought both coupons packs, DO IT NOW! You&#039;re missing out on hundreds of dollars of savings! I plan on trying out the xbox coupon as soon as I get some nice looking paper so I&#039;ll update you all on how that goes.

				&quot;It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second.&quot;<br />John Steinbeck <br /><br />Good quote, but every once in awhile there is someone that completely breaks the mold and is a success without exhibiting any of the latter qualities, someone who has true humility and kindness in spite of having success. I happen to know such an individual and his &quot;name&quot; is Purple Lotus.<br /><br />Purple offers a quality product at a very reasonable rate, it is a product that works well and offers you the opportunity to enjoy nice things for reasonable rates. If you have a family you can feed them well and still have more to maybe take them out or put some much needed savings away for a rainy day. Or, you can save your cash for supplying your smoking habit (or whatever)!<br /><br />The smart newbie would stop here first and buy from Purple first. You can always use cash, cash is what funds this thing (and the world) and is what you need, so start with ways you can save more of it! If you start here and get the coupons then you will have more for any of your pursuits, no matter what they are. If you are on the fence about Purple Lotus, just do it! I am a believer and have used the coupons to feed my family and would not recommend anyone to go on a fools mission. Dope is fine, but having more money for it would be even finer!!!

The typical story for OC coupons is that you earned them by doing surveys and such, on sites like swagbucks. For the $50 visa, just say you put your info in for the promotion and got that coupon in return. If they say, &quot;this is fraudulent&quot; then YOU are the victim, according to your story. You just gave all your details to some unknown scammer, and got a fake coupon in return. And that&#039;s exactly how you should play it.

				Alright everyone! I&#039;ve enhanced the generator to allow for MULTIPLE ITEM COUPONS!<br /><br />This solves the issue many of you have been having re: using multiple identical coupons in the same run, or having to go back multiple times to stock up on whatever you need.<br /><br />Simply change the &#039;Quantity&#039; field in the generator and you can create, for example:<br /><br />&quot;Save $7.50 on any THREE(3) boxes of General Mills® Cereal&quot;<br /><br />Which just happens to be the new freebie coupon!<br /><br />Go check it out, and let me know what you think.<br /><br />http://couponerpcuhkcyn.onion/<br /><br />As always, if you have suggestions, comments, questions or testimonials, post them here or PM me.<br /><br />P.S. I&#039;ve also updated the freebie download. Now you can simply click on the preview image on the Couponers&#039; Club homepage and it will download the full-resolution coupon!

I&#039;ve been couponing with PLs coupons for over half a year, and with my own coupon generator for a bit over a month, and I have literally saved THOUSANDS of dollars. I will typically save hundreds _every time_ I go shopping, just because of these coupon offerings.<br /><br />As for getting your wife to do it, I&#039;d strongly suggest you at least tag along. For one, it&#039;s an excellent confidence booster, and helps you understand how to interact under pressure, which I hope will never be a requirement for anyone here, but given that we ARE on the Silk Road, it&#039;s quite possible that at some point or another, we will have to be able to communicate effectively while being questioned. Secondly, if you are together, you will likely have a mutual excitement that will grow into having new ideas for coupons that will enrich your lives even further. And finally, couponing with a spouse, significant other or perhaps even children improves your own &quot;trustability&quot; in the eyes of the cashier. It&#039;s easy to suspect a single male of intentionally using fake coupons, but it&#039;s significantly less easy to suspect a family man ;)<br /><br />Enjoy the savings, and let me know if you need any help or advice!

				I&#039;ll also say that if you&#039;re still on the fence, just use the current freebie coupon. As of this moment, it&#039;s been downloaded over 20 times, after releasing it just ~2 hours ago.<br /><br />If it&#039;s your very first run, I would suggest the following:<br /><br />1) Print out the freebie coupon on http://couponerpcuhkcyn.onion/ using black and white ink on plain paper<br />2) Print out 2-3 coupons from coupons.com or smartsource.com (unnecessary, but improves your own confidence and the confidence of the cashier, as well as bolsters your plausible deniability)<br />3) Go to Target or Walmart (preferably Target, if that&#039;s an options) and pick up three boxes of the largest General Mills cereal (20.5oz), in addition to the other items you have coupons for from the other websites. If you&#039;re going shopping anyhow, feel free to add whatever other items you need that you would get anyway.<br />4) When checking out, the cashier will first scan all of your items, I leave my coupons at the end of the products on the conveyor belt. 9 times out of 10, the cashier will just scan the coupons and give you your total. If on the off chance they question where you got the cereal coupon, just say you got it from doing surveys online.<br />5) Pay with cash.<br /><br />If you buy the smaller boxes of cereal (so that the total for all 3 is less than 7.50), Target should in fact reduce your total bill by the overage. Walmart will reduce the savings on the coupon to the total cost of the cereal.<br /><br />That should give you a nice taste, and whet your appetite for more savings!<br /><br />As you get more confidence, you will be able to walk in with a stack of these coupons and only these coupons, and have no additional items, and not fret even a little bit. The coupons scan just like any other, and several hundred people have been using them successfully for quite a while with not a single mention of anyone getting into even the slightest bit of trouble from them (with regard to PL&#039;s offerings and my coupon generator). Eventually, you may progress to using the HardCore coupon pack, where you can get free $25 or $50 gift cards and free or near-free high-end electronic devices.

Every single coupon I pass, I get a +1 IRL, and it feels amazing :)<br /><br />Glad to hear you&#039;re enjoying the coupons! PL is very good about correcting any typos or errors in the coupon packs, and I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll have an update for that soon. (Though, I would be remiss in not offering the alternative of using my generator to duplicate the coupon yourself, with the recent enhancement of multiple item coupons ;) ) - Not that I think it&#039;s really important though -- an error like that is not likely to be noticed, and not likely to matter if it was, but I do agree that the coupons should be as accurate as possible, so thank you for pointing it out!<br /><br />side note: 25 posts down, 25 to go!

				Tried the Cereal coupon and it worked! today was the first day i used a coupon from you guys, and i have to say, that popped the cherry alright. I got Brownie crunch, trix, and cinnemon toast.I ended up paying 1.44 since most general mills cereal are 2.99. Its all good though, since its kinda like paying 50 cents for a box of cereal. Now i have to save money to buy things that i really need from the OC collection. Thanks alot klipp and purplelotus!

				Went to Walmart yesterday. Had to buy food to donate in place of community service hours. Ended up filling two carts completely. Rang up around $900 worth of goods in total, and paid $120 total. I had many things I had to buy that I didn&#039;t have coupons for, namely baby formula, and a lot of it. All OC coupons. Scanned everything at a self check out, and kept track of how much savings I was at, and before hitting $50 in savings, I would pay, and start a new transaction. No problems whatsoever. Found the Campbells Chunky coupon to be a money maker. It&#039;ll work with any Campbell&#039;s product. So I purchased many 50 cent campbells soups, and made $1.25 profit for each one. One of my transactions, Walmart actually paid me $15 cash. It was a great feeling.<br /><br />These are amazing, and such a game changer.

				I hit three WalMarts yesterday, trying to max out the $50 limit for CSM approval each time. I&#039;m finally preferentially picking human cashiers, 2/3 for this outing. And I no longer worry about the coupon exceeding the item price, though I haven&#039;t been paid to shop...yet!<br /><br />One checkout went flawlessly. I picked a female cashier, though she got swapped out for a male just as my I got to the head of the line. I had asked the same guy for help finding something earlier, but I don&#039;t think he was a manager.<br /><br />If memory serves, I think I paid a little over $6 for well over $50 worth of groceries. I definitely remember the cashier comment as he handed me my change, &quot;You made a killing.&quot;<br /><br />I owe it to PL and Klipp, the Assassins of High Prices.

				The fist WM cashier experience went well, so I was wanting to use one again. Most lines were backed up w/ a half-dozen customers or more each. I saw the express lane and thought - erroneously, I now realize - that the cashier would be too focused on getting people out the door to pay much notice to my fraudulent coupons. Wrong!<br /><br />I got more scrutiny of the coupons from her than I ever have at WM. Still, even though she called her Customer Svc Mngr over, neither of them ever looked up at me or even suggested that I was doing anything wrong. <br /><br />&quot;They all scanned, so I have to take them,&quot; is what I overheard her tell the CSM. And I was trying to use the Glad Force Flex on another Glad product. They told me I had to buy the specified quantity-sized product, though they didn&#039;t make note of the fact I was trying to use the coupon for recycle bags, rather than Force Flex bags. No problem, I just had them take out the Glad bags and I wound up paying ten bucks and coins for about $50 worth of goods.<br /><br />Halleluiah!

				I just got back from another Walmart trip.&nbsp; My brother and I loaded the cart the highest we have tried so far while also attempting to use roughly 10 coupons we had yet to try.&nbsp; We attempted to try two HC coupons in this trip as well.&nbsp; We tried to use the xbox 360 controller and the Subway GC coupons.&nbsp; We made the mistake of telling the sales associate in electronics that we would pay for the xbox controller separate from the rest of the purchase so we wouldn&#039;t have to have him accompany us to the front register with the item since we still had shopping to do.&nbsp; The cashier in his 20&#039;s was more than happy to ring up the coupon, unfortunately it was very slow in electronics and his immediate supervisor happened to see the coupon.&nbsp; My brother and I watched her look over the coupon for a few minutes and then came over and said they couldn&#039;t accept a coupon such as this.&nbsp; I asked her for a further explanation and she was unable to give me one.&nbsp; Since I had watched what she was doing while looking at the coupon, I could very clearly tell that her rejecting the coupon was solely based on her discretion and nothing else since she hadn&#039;t communicated with anyone else or cross-referenced any existing information.&nbsp; We politely told the manager that we would just email Microsoft regarding the coupon and find an accepting location.&nbsp; In the future, I am positive that if I were to pay for this item at the front register as opposed to the electronics section this coupon would very easily be passed.&nbsp; I have noticed that employees who work in the electronics department often take their positions more seriously than traditional cashiers.&nbsp; In all we had 35 items in our cart with a total of 21 PL coupons.&nbsp; We paid a total of $6.XX for $126.XX in total goods.&nbsp; To be honest, the only challenge my brother and I had was making sure we had an actual balance to pay for.&nbsp; We realized that as we were about to checkout we were close to -$10.00 and decided to throw in non-coupon items into our cart just to make it less of a hassle at the register.&nbsp; <br /><br />For overall HC results we are 4/5 on Subway GC&#039;s, 1/1 on Keurig Machine and 0/1 on the xbox controller.&nbsp; I wish we could do more damage on the HC but all of the Walmart&#039;s in my area have a very limited GC section and unfortunately the UPC&#039;s don&#039;t match on some of the few they have.&nbsp; The OC collection has been essentially perfect to this day.&nbsp; The only failures were completely on myself/printer errors.&nbsp; PL is truly an artist and you are simply throwing away money by not using the OC collection at a minimum.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />@PL: Do you know which retailers are best for using the GC&#039;s?&nbsp; We found a target in the area but didn&#039;t fully understand their coupon policy and since I am currently broke, I didn&#039;t want to risk using my limited funds and not maximizing my grocery supply.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated and thanks again for keeping our panty full.&nbsp;

				Dumb question, it&#039;s probably already been asked, but gotta hit those 50 posts. Should we be purchasing direct from SR or using the couponer club site? <br /><br />I feel like PL is about to become my new favorite person on the planet. <br /><br />TIA!

				Regretfully, I have been informed that Klipp will be resigning from the coupon game in order to pursue better opportunities in life. This will also mean we are collectively retiring the .onion coupon generator. I left the choice up to Klipp and he decided it was in the best interest of his personal safety not to let me take his work and continue with it on my own. I wish this was not the case, but I certainly hold no hard feelings towards him and neither should anyone else. I respect his decision and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.<br /><br />The credit listings are now down, but now I have to address the issue of those of you with remaining credits. Klipp has agreed to allow the site to stay live until Friday evening, in which time you will be free to use any many credits as you have left between now and then. Anyone who has credits left that they paid for on Friday evening, will be given a full refund for those remaining credits. If you want to request the refund now, that is fine too. I wish this wasn&#039;t the case and I certainly apologize to anyone who this inconveniences. Klipp has been gracious enough to return to me enough money to cover his side of the refunds in advance, and depending on whether people burn up their credits or ask for refunds, Klipp has already handed over the money back to me to cover him and I must admit that shows a lot of class.<br /><br />This is disappointing news, of course, but one thing I promise is that I am not slowing down anytime soon. Goodbye Klipp, and again good luck! Even though we didn&#039;t really make any money together, we had a fun time not doing it. :-)<br /><br />PL

Sometimes you may have to peel a strip back a bit to see those numbers (mainly on some VISA cards). then I simply grab a different card and put the one I pulled back a little back and go checkout. <br /><br />PL<br /><br />@asmat3000: Read your coupon policies for each store. Like for Target the max of the same identical coupon you can use is 4, but also be aware that the machine does not make this decision on it&#039;s own, only the cashier can catch it. So there&#039;s that..

				Well went to target today and walmart and had trouble.<br /><br />Super Target was first and i went up to the counter and handed her the 6 items i got and the coupons, she looked at them, scanned two of them then looked at them again and called the manager. <br />She came over and looked em over and told me several things,<br />1. Coke doesnt make coupons so that one was fake<br />2. The bacon one was &quot;a ripoff of a target coupon for the same thing by a dollar off&quot;<br />3. They were all fake<br />She accepted maybe 3 of them which took $15 off by $40 purchase to be nice.<br /><br />I then went to walmart and just bought chez its and bacon (which i tried to use at target earlier and didnt work)<br />The maybe 22 year old cashier looked at them, looked at me, then said &quot;I dont buy em&quot;<br />I said &quot;hey i can show you the website&quot;<br />She then goes &quot;im just messing with you&quot;<br />So they worked there but obviously she knew they were fake but took em anyway,<br />

				I love you PurpleLotus!<br />Here is the story of my very first coupon run:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I looked through the OC packs, I noticed several things I needed but there it was, that damn SodaStreamer! I got to work printing out the SodaStream, Kraft Cheese, Yoplait, Crisco Olive Oil, POM Wonderful, Sour Cream, Windex Electronics Wipes and Tyson Chicken coupons. After I cut those bitches up, it was time to fucking run before I walked. So that&#039;s what I did, I nutted up and ran right into that Bed Bath and Beyond. As I cruised past the checkout, I tried to scope out a potential cashier but there was only some unpredictable chick. As you&#039;ll see, all women are cruel and mysterious sirens that will eat your heart out. Eh hem, anyways... I grabbed my SodaStreamer retailed at $100 and walked right up to the cashier, I kindly said &quot;Hey, how are you?&quot; She be like &quot;good.&quot; With a shitty look on her face. The bitch rang it up when I preceded to say &quot;I got this thing to get $45 off or something...&quot; She stared at the coupon and said, &quot;We don&#039;t always accept manufacture coupons, but that doesn&#039;t mean we wont accept it&quot; The CSM came over and started to stare at it. The cashier said &quot;yeah?&quot; to him. He just nodded and she took off the price. Came to $62, and I came in my pants. Grabbed my receipt and did a 360 right out the door. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, it was time for Target. I had my list ready for the items with coupons and other shiet like Horse Radish my Grandmother wanted. This is where things got complicated. I found all but two items there, the fucking POM which I really wanted and the Crisco Olive Oil. Apparently my Target doesn&#039;t carry them, neither does my Walmart. Such faggotry. I rolled my cart right up to some young cute chick, and tried to spark a little convo but she didn&#039;t say much. The total came to like $40 and I gave her my coupons. She started to read the fine print, and I was like fuck one of these chicks... She then started to say to herself &quot;where is it?&quot; I was like wut?... Then, she had to call the manager and I used my eavesdropping abilities to hear her whisper to the CSM &quot;I&#039;m trying to check for it... but I dunno&quot; &quot;Check for what?&quot; &quot;If they&#039;re fake&quot;. All I could think was shitshitshitshit. Then the manager was like &quot;Nah! Don&#039;t you see those numbers, (Not the UPC btw, dem other weird barcodes) they&#039;re legit&quot;. All scanned perfecto and total was like $13. <br />I&#039;m getting ready for another run and might head to SaveMart to score some POM. If anyone has been to this store with success, I would greatly appreciate some feedback.<br />Feels good man, feels real good.<br />

				PL&#039;s coupons are exactly as advertised. All the ones I have tried work, and the hardcore ones are literally an entirely separate item that is labeled hardcore for a reason. <br /><br />In regards to the coupon&#039;s themselves:<br /><br />The scannable portion of the coupone (barcode) is generated based on an algorithm. The numbers contain the corresponding item or brand and also the amount to be discounted. Unless the store has a programmed LIMIT % price change, STOP, or&nbsp; GET MANAGER value on the price changing function for a particular item/brand (or as an overall store policy) then any scanner should accept the barcode on the coupon and perform the discount operation. CHECK THE BARCODE on the product before you go to use a coupon, make sure it corresponds and you will have a much higher success rate.<br /><br />Every store has different coupon policies, employees, and managers. Your success is much more dependent on your ability to assess these three variables and make intelligent decisions regarding the situation, rather than on the coupon&#039;s validity itself. The coupon will always scan if it corresponds to the barcode on the item. If use of a coupon becomes widespread enough there is likely a corporate notice to store managers about said coupon, which would then probably be entered into aforementioned scanning system and would then return a fail to scan or get manager output. Coupons for higher valued items are obviously more likely to be scrutinized and return get manager messages.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, as an addendum, using the same coupons over a long period of time will likely not work because the store will find out they are fake whenever they are not reimbursed by the manufacturer&nbsp; (based on however frequently they send in their coupons for reimbursement.)<br /><br /><br />That being said PL&#039;s coupons are awesome when used correctly and he has been helpful and hasty in every aspect. I can&#039;t see how anyone could complain about his coupons, if you can&#039;t use them in such a way that you at least break even on the price of them with your savings then it is likely a user error if you get my drift.<br /><br />TL;DR The coupons are fine, find a store with a dumb staff and make sure to match the item barcode to the coupon. Have a good explanation or plan of action ready in case you are confronted. Do these things and success will follow.<br />

				To bodysativa:<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to give anyone instructions or impart my morals and principles into people. I&#039;m trying to talk about what I consider the best approach when using this vendor&#039;s product. I&#039;m also&nbsp; doing so in a thread which exists purely to discuss...... review and usage of this vendor&#039;s product.<br /><br />But, to address your statement. I find your analogy comparing Wal-Mart (the store people go to 80% of the time) to a Silk Road vendor to be a bit of a stretch. Wal-Mart has a GDP that overshadows that of most small countries. I fail to see how me using fake coupons to obtain electronics, pizza rolls and new socks at a discounted price is at all comparable to lying, cheating, and stealing from an individual who you directly solicited for business and who is actually losing money on it. Perhaps you don&#039;t see where the line is drawn but it is pretty clear to me. Even if every person on the SR used these coupons for every grocery purchase for the rest of their life, it wouldn&#039;t even make a noticeable change in&nbsp; Wal-Mart&#039;s profits. Resorting to stealing, conning, and trying to defame someone&#039;s reputation in an effort to better yourself is pretty different in my opinion.<br /><br /><br />Also the forums for an underground network that facilitates one of the world&#039;s most widespread and accessible black markets is not exactly the best place to lecture people on the ethics of cheating a system. <br /><br />And by that same logic why are you ok with using the silk road? It totally provides us with a way in which we can cheat our country out of taxation money by making purchases of illegal substances that support possibly violent criminals. Not to mention facilitating dangerous drug habits that ruin peoples lives! That tax money could be going towards building schools and giving disabled children new robot legs! Shame on us all!<br /><br />It&#039;s all very relative. You can&#039;t just make wild moral extrapolations and say X is the same as Y because you feel like it is. If you find the coupons immoral or wrong then it&#039;s quite simple: don&#039;t use them. <br /><br />By the way I hope you don&#039;t take any of my words to offense. I didn&#039;t take what you said personally, but I do question the logic behind your statements and would petition you to consider what I&#039;m saying.<br />

I&#039;m trying to talk about what I consider the best approach when using this vendor&#039;s product. I&#039;m also&nbsp; doing so in a thread which exists purely to discuss...... review and usage of this vendor&#039;s product.<br /><br />But, to address your statement. I find your analogy comparing Wal-Mart (the store people go to 80% of the time) to a Silk Road vendor to be a bit of a stretch. Wal-Mart has a GDP that overshadows that of most small countries. I fail to see how me using fake coupons to obtain electronics, pizza rolls and new socks at a discounted price is at all comparable to lying, cheating, and stealing from an individual who you directly solicited for business and who is actually losing money on it. Perhaps you don&#039;t see where the line is drawn but it is pretty clear to me. Even if every person on the SR used these coupons for every grocery purchase for the rest of their life, it wouldn&#039;t even make a noticeable change in&nbsp; Wal-Mart&#039;s profits. Resorting to stealing, conning, and trying to defame someone&#039;s reputation in an effort to better yourself is pretty different in my opinion.<br /><br /><br />Also the forums for an underground network that facilitates one of the world&#039;s most widespread and accessible black markets is not exactly the best place to lecture people on the ethics of cheating a system. <br /><br />And by that same logic why are you ok with using the silk road? It totally provides us with a way in which we can cheat our country out of taxation money by making purchases of illegal substances that support possibly violent criminals. Not to mention facilitating dangerous drug habits that ruin peoples lives! That tax money could be going towards building schools and giving disabled children new robot legs! Shame on us all!<br /><br />It&#039;s all very relative. You can&#039;t just make wild moral extrapolations and say X is the same as Y because you feel like it is. If you find the coupons immoral or wrong then it&#039;s quite simple: don&#039;t use them. <br /><br />By the way I hope you don&#039;t take any of my words to offense. I didn&#039;t take what you said personally, but I do question the logic behind your statements and would petition you to consider what I&#039;m saying.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well said!

				Ok scout... since he is now in the big boy forums... I&#039;ll agree to let it go and shake his hand and call it what it is and let things happen how they are going to happen.

I take no words back, and I still despise the fact that he makes the claim he has made all of those coupons himself... obviously that makes me rather sick to my stomach after all of my work, and since it&#039;s such an obvious lie on his part, but ultimately things will speak for themselves. It just irritates me to think that if I don&#039;t stand out and speak up, that people will be fooled by this. <br /><br />I started here selling coupons that I collected from 4chan. I listed them and never made any claims that they were my own work. I did however make the claim that I had personally tested each one to verify they did in fact work before putting them up for sale, and I kept that promise. Then I started to realize the flaws in that method, even when it was done honestly and without deception, and so I decided to scrap that strategy and begin my very own custom coupon collection for SR users only.

Seems logical that you would have overlooked such a thing if you were lying, and also logical that if you were being honest you would want to show that. <br /><br />Oh, that&#039;s right, I agreed to shake hands and stop arguing?

				So I came to post my experience in the newb thread cause I haven&#039;t done it in a while and seems like drama&#039;s back.<br />When I bought PL&#039;s offering all I had to go on was his 100 raintgs and an extremely positive review thread. That and the cheap price were good enough for me.<br />I can&#039;t vouch for Nickmode&#039;s work and don&#039;t wish to be part of this argument (although if allegations are true it&#039;s messed up) but PurpleLotus coupons are not old news quite yet, in fact the man works hard to update exp dates and any valid coupon that is known to be flagged as fake. <br />I&#039;ve saved close to $1k with both of PL&#039;s collections and have only good things to say about him, his products and his customer service.<br />If anyone reading the last couple of pages started to have second thoughts... DON&#039;T, these work. Just today I saved 90 on 120 worth of groceries. I cannot recommend this enough.

				I bought pls packs a couple weeks ago and have had great results. I have over 10 gift cards the wow and tons off on foods I would never buy because they where not able to fit in my limited budget. Like the oj greek yogurt. With the regular set of coupons I have never had a hitch. But with the oc set I have had to have manager assist to allow the cashier to use them and all but the last time had they not been excepted without serious scrutiny from the cashier. That was mostly my fault though bc I picked an older lady who I had thought looked like she did not care. But I was wrong she would not stop with the crap saying oh these are fake never would a company give that much off blah blah blah. She called the manager over and still went on how it could not be true. But the manager said if they scan they would take them. So I am still a 100% on tries. Only thing that I think sucks is that around here no one has the visas. I have to also find a place for the soda one and no one seems to have the gen4 touch. As far as the xbox sony kindle and apple ones I would love to try but I am to far away from cali and I would think it might throw up warnings. But I may still try to use them sometime just to see. Thanks PL I like saving money :)

				I have nothing but thanks for PurpleLotus&#039; work. It has saved me about $750 in just over a month. I&#039;ve walked away w/ a half-dozen gift cards, including a $50 gas card last weekend (made the kids at the CVS front counter my bitches on Sunday.)<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken a slow, incremental approach, but I can now walk out of a WalMart with $50 of free food and never even need a manager&#039;s approval - not that those are at all hard to get. And the sky appears to be the limit at Target.<br /><br />If you can get $40 in btc and you buy groceries or rely on someone who buys groceries, then every moment you live is wasted without the PurpleLotus Original Coupon collection. Without it, you are wasting hundreds of dollars a month on groceries.

They worked fine at the self service checkout until I got to a $10 off coupon. It froze the machine. I had to get a CSR. She asked me if I used a $10 coupon right off the bat and I said &quot;yes.&quot; She said, &quot;for a prescription?&quot; I said &quot;nope.&quot; She opened the coupon container and looked at my coupons, got the price scanner going again, entered my coupon by hand, took it to her station and got out a sheet with coupon pics on it. Some other lady came over and they both were comparing while I finished up and walked out. Not another word was said to me. <br /><br />So I would say, if you don&#039;t want to involve a CSR, don&#039;t use $10 and over at Meijer. I had four 8 packs of Gatoraid and those scanned just fine.

				Hey all, I&#039;m loving this stuff. I went to shop at CVS today and saved about 23 out of 47 bucks. I didn&#039;t want to go all buck wild with it the first time around lol. I scanned the coupons at the self checkout but had a bit of trouble. After I scanned one, the amount saved would show up in red and the machine stopped letting me scan anything else. This happened a few times, unfortunately. The cashier walked over and cleared it up for me though lol. Would it be better to just check out with a person next time?

				Everything is still working fine here!&nbsp; We shopped a nice big load at Target.&nbsp; I am HOOKED on those Bolthouse fruit smoothies. Props to PL for improving the quality of my diet and as a result, my health. <br /><br />Finally got off my butt and made some of my own with the generator the day before it went offline.&nbsp; Off to try out my own masterpieces today!

				I just had a bad run.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; &nbsp;I do believe it was NOT the coupons though. I believe it was Walmart. I live in a small area. Two WM&#039;s on opposite sides of the county is all that is around here.<br /><br />So, went to Walmart and used the self scan checkout. I didn&#039;t have much. My first coupon was $2.00 off a $2.89 product. It scanned and told me to insert it in the slot so all good. The next coupon was $2.75 off of a $2.98 product. It scanned but this screen popped up and said to hold the coupon and show it to the cashier (CSR). I put it in the slot anyway, hit ok and it took me back to the scanning screen. I scanned the next one. It was for $7 off of Cottonelle but the actual cost was $6.98. I got the screen to show it to the cashier and had already put it in the slot but here she was and she over rode it because it did not take 7 bucks off the total.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure she saw that I was supposed to call her for the previous one but didn&#039;t and that&#039;s why she came over.<br /><br />The next two were ones I made with the generator. One was $9.50 off of an item costing $11. It scanned and I was again presented with the screen to hold the coupon. She was watching and came over and again, the machine did not subtract the $9.50. She scanned it again and tried to do an override but it would not let her. I had the last coupon in my hand which was for $9.75 off of&nbsp; $11 as well and she said, &quot;lets try this one.&quot; She was very nice by the way and she did look the coupons over and must not have seen a problem with them. She scanned it, got the screen and tried to override it. No go. She suggested that I go to the customer service desk because she kept tapping but the override function was like it was froze. I had a feeling in my gut that going to the service desk would cause problems so I just gave up.<br /><br />I am so disappointed because I volunteer for the Humane Society and was really going to do a Robin Hood for them (actually PL is Robin Hood and me, one of his merry &#039;women&#039;) with donations for the homeless animals. Of course I have a menagerie of my own that is quite the financial burden so I am hoping this won&#039;t happen at another store. <br /><br />Next time, I&#039;m going to drive about 75 miles away to a big city and see what happens and I&#039;ll also try a Target if I can find one with self check out. It appears that particular rural Wally World thinks that every time someone uses more than one coupon at the self service register, it will have to be examined by a CSR. Wonder how long that will last?<br /><br />Anyone else run into this at a Walmart? I could not believe that after scanning one coupon, the rest are required to be examined by a CSR even though they scanned just fine. That&#039;s a bunch of bullshit!!! Grrrrrr!<br />------------------<br />* I just read comments over on the main coupon thread about Walmart. If any non-noobs are reading this, you might want to share.

				You really do make a lot of sense about the self checkouts being more susceptible to other types of abuse. I think I used five coupons and purchased another 5 items without coupons.&nbsp; I guess my way of starting slowly was using the self checkouts until I build confidence. That was only my third run. Whats ironic is that I usually avoid self checkouts because it replaces people who could otherwise be working, with machines. <br /><br />I did go to the other WM at the beginning of the week and passed a 7 and two 10&#039;s without a problem at the self checkout. Now I&#039;m to know if its just that second WM that has that policy or if its a new one for both of these local ones and it just got changed this week. I don&#039;t see how that policy could be cost effective for WM but I think its funny because they sometimes run up to 10 self checkouts with one CSR watching to save on labor costs. They gonna need two or three now.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m off to the big city in the next few days and will bypass the self checkouts and march right up to the register per your advice.

				@ xxqvxx<br /><br />I would expect that the difference in the &quot;policy&quot; you may be noticing between the&nbsp; two Walmart&#039;s has less to do in fact with policy but rather minor equipment differences.&nbsp; Stores often times implement the self-checkout stands at different times and I am sure like most software, minor updates create minor differences in results.&nbsp; In my one attempt using a self-checkout at Walmart, I noticed that my coupons which were for under the purchase price worked just fine.&nbsp; My only issues needing csm approval where for items like the Bounty paper towels which paid me to take them.&nbsp; I always avoid self-checkout stands normally on principle so it wasn&#039;t a big issue that it was less desirable for coupon trips also.<br /><br />My belief that fake coupons are a minor threat compared to traditional theft was only reconfirmed this morning when I was downtown and had the displeasure of being stuck next to five skeezy meth-heads who were loudly discussing their ongoing theft of major retailers in front of a large group of people.&nbsp; As long as there is such low hanging fruit for LE/LP, I will feel great using coupons to cover my grocery bills.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				@PL, Question about the lessons. Is there some type of manual or something you wrote up to get started and then if we have trouble with it, ask questions? Just wondering how this works.

				There is a manual along with all the fonts, programs, templates, etc... then there is my input on the practical application of the manual and how I use it. Then as we move through each stage of making a coupon, you can ask me any questions, have me take a look at your progress and give feedback, until you finally understand all of it and can make a coupon for anything as good as I can. 100% satisfaction guaranteed, I&#039;ll look over all your work and even go test your first coupon out myself if you would like... I&#039;ll probably be just as excited to try it as you (well ok maybe not that much, but still excited)

				@TwoneNathandjoe: You certainly dont have to tell us which stores you went to but it makes it a lot easier for people to be able to break down what might have happened since every store is going to react differently to these in subtle ways at times. Possibly the coupon was higher than the cost of the item and this particular store is one that does not play well with that. Target on the other hand plays so well with that, that they actually credit the remainder of the coupon towards your other items. <br /><br />Feel free to just message me if you want and see what I think, or for quicker results with more opinions, just say the store next time. Many people do say the store, while many don&#039;t like to share that... it&#039;s up to you. <br /><br />@piratesofpenzance: I personally always just sent them to my buyer account up until I became a vendor, and now even on my buyer account I take security much more serious. What I mean to say is, if you are only buying a few things here and there, then it really doesn&#039;t matter much.

				Sorry, it was Wal-Mart. I&#039;m not worried at all, as soon as I can get to town (I live far from everything but the omnipresent wal-mart) I&#039;ll try them at other stores. The price of the 4-pack monster was actually 2 cents lower than the price reduction give by the coupon, but the cokes were slightly above the reduction when taken as all 3. Regardless, I can make my money back just with the two coupons I&#039;ve gotten to work so far, and I have folders of them left to try :)

Cali is a classic (but not at all classy) troll. Just stirring up sh1t for no good reason.<br /><br />PL&#039;s products have done a world of good for a lot of people, and we shouldn&#039;t have to read any troll sh1t from people who aren&#039;t seriously trying to save some money for their families. Loss Prevention is too focused on meth-head boosters and other obvious theft. Thinking that the OC will get you busted, shows a complete misunderstanding of the players in the retail arena.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read and experienced in nearly $1,000 worth of personal savings w/ PL products, maybe 1%-10% cashiers will balk at the OC - but more often than not, they&#039;ll be overruled by the CSM, who will approve them.<br /><br />And never ever have the OC - or the few HC that I&#039;ve used, for that matter - ever resulted in me being followed back to my car by Loss Prevention or caused me to get any obvious scrutiny. And Loss Prevention is VERY obvious in most cases, to anyone with even basic observational skills.<br /><br />To the contrary, using the OC and a human cashier makes you look MORE like a legitimate customer than the average shopper - seriously, it truly does. Dressing well, acting politely, shopping when they&#039;re busy AND being an innocent-looking couponer will help you avoid LP more than whether or not you use the OC.

				I&#039;m glad that we noobs can read the main thread, at least, for gems like what 420 just wrote,<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: 420blindman </div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...Found some info that can help when possibly being questioned about any coupons, not just PLs. The biggest lawsuit brought to big box stores is slander (accusing you of using fraudulent coupons), and unlawful detention (holding you against your will, and with zero authority). Both of these usually end in a payout to the victim, in order to avoid court.<br />From my personal experience, when being questioned, it&#039;s normally nothing, and I&#039;ll just ask not to use the one coupon that&#039;s causing the trouble. However, when they have an attitude or are being snotty, then I&#039;ll raise my voice pretty loud and demand if the are accusing me of a crime. I make a scene, and demand to see management. I request that the cashier be fired when my coupons scan, for treating me like a criminal. And they always scan, so the store is left with a handful of paper, a jackass cashier who probably does get fired, and now has to review and retrain they&#039;re personal on how to treat customers with respect. Of course, I won&#039;t visit that store for a couple of months, but when I do return, I make sure to maximize my savings, and fucking them over as much as possible. It&#039;s my favorite pastime, fucking the system with PLs coups.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s, of course, best to be polite and friendly - unless a cashier outright accuses you, the customer, of being &quot;shady&quot; or a criminal. Then any self-respecting customer would be outraged and could be expected to raise his voice and demand to see a manager. No need for any real profanity - certainly no F-bombs. You are, after all, a decent, upstanding member of the community who uses coupons, as any sensible, frugal person would. <br /><br />Through no fault of your own, you got some coupons off of the Internet which, in the expert opinion of your wise-ass cashier may be of dubious lineage. Let&#039;s put your cashier&#039;s Ph.D in Criminology up against the store&#039;s Point Of Sale system and see if the coupon scans. Wow, it does scan? Then your cashier really doesn&#039;t know what s/he&#039;s talking about, I guess. And s/he just called me a criminal in front of the whole store? I can&#039;t imagine why s/he shouldn&#039;t be fired.<br /><br />Just have that calm, righteously indignant attitude in the back of your mind, as your fall back position in the unlikely event that the cashier really tries to &quot;call you out&quot;. No one can touch you.&nbsp; 8)

				HAHA yes I meant to go comment on that too.. although I can relate to 420blindman and have situationally taken a similar stance before with great success... I definitely don&#039;t think everyone is cut out for that strategy in the event that some cashier did question the coupons legitimacy.

				Update: I&#039;ve had quite a few success stories with the coupons today. I actually tried the 4 pack Monster again at the big W, the same error came up but this time the cashier that headed the self check-out lane called a front end manager to the scene and she approved the coupon for me manually. <br /><br />PL, remind me that I need to send you a donation next time I fund my account with BTC, which will most likely be to purchase something else from you ;)

Have you even tried that Monster coupon not at self checkout? Seeing as how you are gaining experience dealing with live people anyway in your S.C. journies, go try to take that experience to a cashier.

				+1 for live cashiers. Sometimes S.C is programmed to be more limiting than when a person mans it. <br /><br />@the Advocate, I thought about it when gen was up. there are very few national (or close enough) brands. laura&#039;s beef, perdue and some bagged green beans brand come to mind. <br /><br />Fun fact: valentines day rolls $13B+ every year.

PL is king but it&#039;s good to know that other people try :) but also that said dept. store would have been wise to just let her and her $20 go and not waste man power and line up friday night crowds

				I do have a question in the meantime, though, regarding the HC. Would it be a good idea, in your experience, to have these printed off full color on some sort of glossy paper? Should I be kinko-ing these motherfuckers? Or are they just as likely to be accepted when doing a color or BW print on standard paper, saying I them via e-mail after completing a survey or somesuch?

				This comes up often if you read back. you&#039;ll hear votes for every option.

				First off, I would just like to thank PL for these offerings. I have not yet bought them, but I plan to do so very soon!<br /><br />Secondly, I had an idea with the HC collection, wondering if anyone else thought of this. Getting the GCs, and then selling them en masse online? Say you have 20 stores in your area, you get a 50% success rate, that is 400$ if you get the 50$ visa GC using a site I found. Anyone else thought of/had success with this?

				No WM? It might be worth a drive, or even a day trip, hitting up a wide range of stores throughout the day. One thing I&#039;ve found useful is to keep my coupons in a three ring binder with a paper inserted under the clear dustcover that lists all of the 5 digit UPC numbers that each of the coupons UPC starts with so I can easily match products, it&#039;s much quicker than shuffling through your stack for every item you grab off the shelf, and you get to look like a real life TV extreme couponer to boot!

				I thought they stopped carrying them because of the spat over Amazon taking away some of their business? I have not actually checked all the ones in my area extensively, should do that soon.

				Damn, you&#039;re right! That almost ruins my evening! I bought a kindle there just under a year ago and was looking forward to getting another one (the previous one was lost in a move). Apparently the Home Depot carries them, as well as Target, which has been promoted here as the best place to spend these coupons. Unfortunately I haven&#039;t got a Target nearby.

				The standard advice is to stick w/ the big three - WM, Target &amp; The K - but what is surprising are the regional and smaller chains where PL&#039;s coups DO work. I&#039;m in the middle of nowhere, so having a couple of local chains where I can use PL&#039;s work saves a lot on gas. I&#039;ve picked up a couple of Wendy&#039;s gc&#039;s at one and the other apparently has a policy of hiring only hotties for cashiers. Schwing!<br /><br />I&#039;m still feeling out that place (and enjoying it like a dirty old man should enjoy his grocery shopping), but it doesn&#039;t look like getting a manager to turn the key there is at all hard. It&#039;s just as easy as WM, the K or most other places. (And some of their managers seem to be teen hotties too!)<br /><br />Only one local chain has outright refused to take the coupons at all. And for all I know, that was just one rouge cashier. Regardless, no big loss since that&#039;s the chain w/ the shittiest selection. At another the manager held up the checkout line for the better part of 10 minutes, smiling and shaking his head while he stared at the coups. In the end, though, he accepted them all.<br />And another location/manager/time of day could produce much more favorable conditions.

				He&#039;s said already in the other thread he&#039;s putting in a lot of hours completely revamping the OC coupons for dates and CIC, I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll get back to you as soon as he can. PL is the hardest working and most customer oriented vendor on SR for sure

I made my first one after about 8 hours total reading and testing the software and about 30 minutes of design and it worked first try, before even asking any questions! My own custom coupon, the first of many to come. With the $ and time involved it will not take very long for the return on investment. Now that I understand the process it should only take me about 15 minutes or less to make each coupon. PL said he will only sell so many of these so you guys better jump on that $100 offer before you can&#039;t.<br />********<br /><br />Thanks PL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				Hey PL. Loving your work. Keep it up please. :D<br />I&#039;ve been using a few of the OC coupons and plan on starting with the HC when you update today. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m looking through these coupons and wondering where you&#039;ve tested them. I imagine you&#039;ve tested at the major chains? Target, Walmart, etc.<br /><br />On these full page Visa and Sony coupons should I just print these on normal paper or should I try a little higher quality printing job?<br /><br />Also, one last thing; I&#039;d like to get the community&#039;s thoughts on (as well as yours to see if you could do it) a coupon for better Beats by Dre. The in ears are great headphones and I love that you added them, but I&#039;d LOVE to see Studios or Solos on the list. :D<br /><br />Again, keep up the work. Hopefully will be much more active on this forum.

				I bought purple lotus&#039; coupon collection even though i dont shop for food myseld mainly cuz i though it would be worth it. I ve used his coupons like once or twice and i usually shop for food like 0 times a year since i have food provided to me... but im soon going to need to purchase my own food and am excited to be able to use his collection. Ive only attempted to use maybe 7 of his coupons and out of those 7, 5 of them worked.

				California, you can easily make an argument in either direction, but from over here the larger organizations, especially wal-mart, are victimizing the commuinities they are &quot;feeding&quot;. Consider firstly that Wal-Mart has a higher profit yearly than many countries, AFTER they pay their employees and other costs, and yet still don&#039;t pay their part-time employees any health benefits, not to mention that many people, even after working at wal-mart for many years STILL make incredibly small wages, usually no more than $12 per hour after 5-10 years. The health package for full-time associates has declined over the years to almost nothing. They&#039;ve phased out full-time employees that aren&#039;t management to almost nothing, to avoid paying health care. They selectively weed out employees reaching full-vestment time in order prevent paying their promised share of retirement.<br /><br />Wal-Mart uses predatory methods to pay the lowest amount possible for their wholesale products, at times leaching companies providing products literally to death and then moving on to another source to bleed. On the other end of this same method, local stores which would pay employees fairly are choked out of communities.<br /><br />I won&#039;t deny that this is theft, legally speaking, I just have a hard time giving a good goddamn.

				crazy: You save as much money as your enthusiasm for couponing goes. That sounds grammatically terrible, but I think I convey my meaning! You could end up not paying for groceries at all more or less any more, if you don&#039;t mind rotating stores.<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re on SR forums you&#039;ve installed Tor correctly.

				HELLO EVERYONE !<br /><br />&nbsp;Okay if someone would be so kind as to copy this post to the main post that would be great i&#039;m just trying to get my report out there. Okay so yesterday went to Wmart and saved over $115 ! yay ! me and the wife were stoked. So we thought we would get the rest of our stuff this morning after dropping the kids off at school. We showed get dressed fairly nice, and had out one year old daughter with us, model family. So my wife went OCD on me and was doing math on everything while we were shopping and it took FOREVER but we were getting things we needed. So we totaled everything up and ended up to just over $250.00. Awesome, one by one they got scanned watching the price drop lower and lower than, BEEP &quot;REQUEST CSM OVERRIDE&quot;, Fuck. No big deal he&#039;ll just do a key turn put his code in and be on his way. Nope, he saw all the coupons and said &quot;your putting all these in?&quot;. The cashier said that it never happened to her before, Double Fuck. He starts looking in the coupons and looks at. every. god. damn. one. Then he said oh &quot;this appears fraudulent&quot; to which i said &quot;how do you mean?&quot; he explains that there are people out there that manipulate coupons to get whatever they need while i was giving me &quot;are you fucking serious look&quot;. Then he grabs a stack and tells me he need to check with the security manager, triple fuck. After about five minutes he comes back and HANDPICKS BY EYE which coupons they can&#039;t accept. Mother Fucker. let&#039;s just say out of my 35+ coupons i had, he was only allowing me to use like 6. I got my coupons back and i told him it was fair that he can just decline whatever the hell he feels like and accept whatever and he said it&#039;s store policy that they can decline a coupon if they feel it&#039;s fake. IF THEY FEEL LIKE IT&#039;S FAKE. IF THEY FEEL. FUCK YOU. needless to say the once $250 cart of goodies i had, re-turned into a $40 worth of items of some what goodies,so i paid $16 for what i had. cause i wasn&#039;t paying full price for all that shit. So I left everything right there that was rejected, took my coupons and me and wife and little girl left, defeated. Only good thing that came out of it is the fact that they told us that, if any coupon exceeds the cost of the actual item it throws up a red flag. so there&#039;s that.<br /><br />Also has anyone had success with Food Lion, Harris Teeter, or Lowes food ? Or possibly the military commissary ?

				Regarding WalMart, $50 worth of coupons is the cut-off for requiring CSM approval. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s $50 and above or just above $50, but if you keep the coupon total under $50 you just have to get past the cashier.<br /><br />And if you go right after the suppertime rush, maybe around 6-7 PM, you have a better chance of a cashier not caring enough to second-glance the coupons.<br /><br />HTH

				I think that&#039;s true about about the coupon exceeding the item price producing a Point-Of-Sale warning message/beep. But, most of the cashiers are just going to click right through that error, as long as you&#039;ve got an item from the right manufacturer.<br /><br />I should say that does suck about the suspicious cashier and manager. I&#039;ve had a hiccup or two in a couple of months of passing over $1500 worth of coupons. But, I think if you try a new WalMart this weekend - or better several WalMarts, KMarts and Targets - keeping the coupon value under $50 per WalMart checkout, you will have much better luck. And Target seems much friendlier.<br /><br />You and your wife probably looked fine and would have sailed through checkout, if not for the asshole cashier and manager, and maybe the time of day you shopped. Try, try again...

It&#039;s just to bad the nearest target or w mart is 45 min either way, which it looks like i&#039;ll be making next shopping visit, although next time i know to keep w mart under $50 in saving at each register and split between different stores to be more under the radar.

				Hey, so I printed out the coupons in black and white, cut em out, went to the grocery store, and all 7 of them worked. I didn&#039;t read instructions on here, which was probably not smart, but I went up to the cashier (black male, early 20s -- looked like he just didnt give a fuck), joked around with him a bit as he rang my stuff up (probably the only somewhat real interaction he had all day) and scanned em all in for me. No harm no foul.<br /><br />Ill prob go over directions again, but common sense seems to prevail here. Be smart, divert their attention, save $$.<br /><br />Thanks PL. Good shit. Once I get some more money flowing in, I&#039;d for sure start setting up donations for the food bank.

				that seemed to work okay with the unchecking fit to picture thing however - it seems as though its wasting a whole sheet of paper and the coupons come out MUCH larger when doing that for me anyways - like GIANT - <br /><br />best ive found was copying/pasting or dragging the picture in a word processor as the previous poster stated - <br />maybe im missing something but they seem to be much closer to normal <br />

				Ok, First purchase and first post. I have been on Tor for awhile and had heard of SR, but didn&#039;t really think much about it until I lost my job last month and needed to get creative fast! So I hop on and look around these coupons catch my eye.....so I have been studying this thread and PL&#039;s feedback for a week or 2...watching the BC value rise...so&nbsp; bit the bullet and grabbed them today, first impression is better than expected, of course the UPC is flawless but I didn&#039;t expect the watermarks and coupon site logos...these look way legit! I&#039;m going shopping Friday, going to hit a few stores and try 10-15 of these. I&#039;ll post my results. I did use the camel one up the road at the Shell station...the guy didn&#039;t blink..Name Brand smokes at 90&#039;s prices...I&#039;m giddy...lolThanks PL!!

Worst case, the manager is an asshole and you try somewhere else. I got rebuffed at the only Chick-fil-a I tried, then went by McD&#039;s and drove away w/ a free supersized Big Mac, Fries &amp; Coke. And the coupon says &quot;for the greater Los Angelas area only.&quot; It just takes a little bit of calm confidence &amp; social engineering. But you&#039;ll be surprised how easy it is.<br /><br />Go during lunch or dinner rush hour, preferably toward the end of it, but not long enough for them to put their second string in. And I&#039;m guessing that, like retail couponing, your best bet is on the weekend, when the experienced folks are off work and the crowds overwhelm the cashiers. Dress well and act reasonably nice.

Just give it a shot. Worst that happens is they say no.

But this ebook saves you ALOT of time and no waiting all day for a response.<br /><br />Also, PL hates competition. Ive seen him get on forums and treat others like complete shit that trys to sell anything coupon related. lol. I understand he&#039;s just tryna look out for scam artists and for his customers and the SR community but how he does it isnt kool at all.&nbsp; and about the price of aldog25&#039;s ebook, he says on his profile that all prices are negotiable just pm him.

Also maybe check out the coupon policies of the stores you plan on visiting.

Well I hope I can help with the first part. To answer your question about stacking... it just depends on your store policy. I know the same question came up on the regular forums about this, and PL said at Target he&#039;d stacked more than store policy because the computers don&#039;t stop it. So just check into the policy of the store. And if you can&#039;t find it that way just try it. The worst they can say is no and you can put the second item aside.<br /><br />As for the other problem, all coupons (legit or counterfeit) have their problems. Sometimes it&#039;s the store, but sometimes they just don&#039;t scan right. I&#039;d make sure they&#039;re trying both barcodes if there&#039;s some kind of error coming up. Because I know (at least for one local chain here) they HAVE to scan the UPC barcode or it messes up every time. If the gs1 is scanned it sends the computer an error, so they usually cover it up so the UPC barcode is scanned.<br /><br />I&#039;ll report back and see if I have any problems with those specific coupons though.

For example - 500 sheets 25&quot; x 38&quot; of 70# coated paper will weigh 70 pounds.<br />Weight has not only an effect on the feel of the magazine (heavier paper will generally be thicker and less easy to fold) but also shipping/mailing costs of the final magazine. More weight costs more to ship/mail.<br /><br />Grade Specifications<br />A grade is a way of ranking paper by certain composition and characteristics. For example, brightness is one of the characteristics used to determine a paper&#039;s grade. A number 5 paper grade has the lowest brightness (less white and uniform texture), from 69-73. A number 3 grade paper has a brightness from 81-84.5. Number 1 grade paper has 89-96 brightness. Most magazines run on #3-#5 grade stock.<br /><br />Uncoated Offset Paper<br />Uncoated Paper is designed to generally run in offset presses and is a non-coated sheet of #50 or 60#. Also- return card offset stock is usually run on a 75# uncoated stock to meet postal requirements.<br /><br />Freesheet Paper<br />Freesheet paper is free of groundwood pulp and has a bit higher brightness (whiter) than groundwood paper. Freesheet starts at a number 3 grade. Magazines commonly use 50#, 60#, 70# text weight freesheet options on the interior and 80#, 100# text weight or 66# cover weight freesheet stock on cover options. Freesheet paper is more costly than Groundwood.<br /><br />Groundwood Paper<br />Characteristics of groundwood paper are higher bulk, smooth feel, lower brightness (whiteness) and good printability. It is usually lower in cost than freesheet paper. Magazines commonly use 36#, 40#, 45#, 50# and 60# groundwood paper. Groundwood is available in number 4 or number 5 grade.<br /><br />Coated Offset Paper<br />Coated papers are described by their finish: matte, dull, or gloss.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Gloss- The majority of magazines today use gloss paper, the property responsible for coated paper&#039;s shiny or lustrous appearance. Gloss papers are less opaque and have less bulk and are less expensive than Dull and Matte papers.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Dull- Smooth surface paper that is low in gloss. Dull coated paper falls between matte and glossy paper.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Matte- A non-glossy, flat looking paper. Matte papers are higher in cost and in bulk.<br />

				Good looking out Wraithe. <br /><br />I can&#039;t find it but there are some holograms I found on Silk Road...kind of spendy, but if you&#039;re doing HC coupons for game stations or whatever stick one of these on some high end stock with your coupon printed out it might just work!<br />Anyone try this yet?

				I feel like I should give some feed back here, since I&#039;ve used the original and hardcore coupons a bit. So far only managed to get the xbox live to work from the hardcore set. Here&#039;s my input thus far:<br /><br />Xbox live worked at target. Had to go to three different cashiers until finally getting a assistant manager to approve the transaction. The first two were regular associates so were unable to approve it. For the newbies, most stores have a cut off between $40-50 dollars before needed manager, or assistant manager approval in order to accept coupons. In the forums you will see people refer to this as a &quot;key turn&quot;, since the manager technically turns a key in the register to override the computer system put in place. <br /><br />With any run, you will be surprised what you get away with. At target for the Xbox Live Card, a police officer, and two security guards were both standing and sitting leisurely behind the manager while placing my transaction. No fucks were given by either parties. Now this was late before closing, and they could have just not given a fuck. I know I didn&#039;t to be honest. It was a long day. Remember all they can do is say no. If they question you, simple speak out your ass about getting them off a survey, having a family member that&#039;s a hard core couponer, etc. You&#039;d be surprised the bullshit that will come out your mouth.<br /><br />In my experience the original coupons are a no brainer.&nbsp; So long as you stick to a large grocery store franchise, or you get lucky at one of those smaller local places. For smaller places, I would ask, or go for a test run before going all out and filling up my cart. Many people continue success with Target, Walmart, and other major grocery stores. Hell I even had a cashier check &quot;the book&quot; in order to validate the legitimacy of the original coupons. Came back and I ask her if there was a problem. In which she replied, &quot;I just had to check our book to make sure the coupons were not fraudulent.&quot; Had to contain my laughter. Felt on top of the world getting away with that. And had even more respect for PurpleLotus with his immaculate work. <br /><br />I try my best to not hit the same store more then once, or twice a month. Some people get away with once a week. I wouldn&#039;t doubt it, just switch up your times so as you don&#039;t run into the same staff during their shifts. And if you did hit a store once a week, make it a big store like walmart or something. PurpleLotus once mentioned, when a manager tries to tell you some bullshit, take it with a grain of salt. Example: I went to one Walgreens which the manager claimed, they didn&#039;t take cigarette coupons. Which of course was bullshit because I just finished hitting up another Walgreens with success. So feed them the same bullshit right back. <br /><br />It&#039;s always good to read store coupon policies as well. Trust me, if you do, you&#039;ll be ahead of the game. Let&#039;s face it, no employees ever have to read that shit. Even if they did, they would probably read over it the same way you read over terms of service of anything you sign up for. Which you don&#039;t. Point being. I believe appearance also plays a factor. Don&#039;t look like a bum. It will come off suspicious. Be curious, and respectful. Your goal is for them to scan your coupon and see if it goes through. If they don&#039;t want to accept it, try and at least convince them to scan it. So you yourself knows it works on said product, with said barcode. If it does, well shit congrats. If not, well fuck, just say, &quot;thank you for trying, I&#039;ll go to dumbfuckville and try there.&quot; But remember that product, so you know what to look for. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">PurpleLotus has said it time and time again, all they can say is no.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Simple. If they try and say, oh these look fake or whatever else to deny your legitimacy, just laugh it off as a compliment. Say, yeah I get that often. Coupons are not easy to come by, but most people don&#039;t take the time to take simple surveys. Sometimes I go as far as feeding them so much bullshit, that even I begin to believe my own bullshit, but that&#039;s what you want. <br /><br />Once you walk into a store, know you&#039;re a motherfucking god of couponing. You know the system, this isn&#039;t your first time. You save shit loads every week. You spend hours cutting out coupons for magazines, and taking online surveys, and you also print internet coupons out for being a member of online coupon websites. Don&#039;t let them feed you the bullshit that there&#039;s not such thing as printed coupons. They just don&#039;t know there way around the internet. Internet coupons have been around for years. Hmm can&#039;t add on to anything else. I hope this helps though.<br /><br />By the way, when you print your coupons, color or black and white, make sure they are in good enough shape to scan. Don&#039;t print them out to small, or to large. You want them to look like real coupons, and most importantly you want them to scan. Yes I did go to a store once, and had the cashier type in manually like 10 coupons. Felt like that was a bit of amateur mistake on my part. Buy a printer, buy ink, and save yourself the trouble. Plus going to a print shop adds up. Pro tip: Get a HP Printer. You&#039;ll have a ten dollar off HP ink coupon. <br /><br />Cheers.

				Ok...just back from Sunday shopping. I thought I would check in.<br /><br />Target: $83 down to $20. I had a couple of tiny Target coupons in there....I dropped a $5 Kraft coupon and paid before I realized. The Cashier directed me to the customer service desk where they just scanned it and they handed me a $5 bill :D<br /><br />Wal Mart: Did the bulk of my produce, meats and dairy there so only used 6 coupons. $80. Down to $51...made 7 cents on TP! Cashier told me she &quot;liked my coupons&quot; ;)<br /><br />So not as glamorous as some stories but I don&#039;t usually buy a lot of groceries anyway...FACT I have officially mad back the O package cost AND the cost of the B&amp;W laser printer I bought for especially for this in less than a week!

				GODDAMMIT I had an amazingly long review here and my session timed out. GRRRRRRRR, I&#039;ll try to recreate. Keep in mind the original was much more enthusiastic. <br /><br />So I&#039;m a new kid and bought PL&#039;s original pack last week. Used it over the weekend at a local chain grocery store. Because I&#039;m an idiot it never occurred to me to edit the images so I just straight up printed them and several printed out full size 8.5x11. I also used pink paper because that&#039;s how I roll. So basically these are the most ghetto looking things of all time. <br /><br />Headed to a local chain grocery store late morning Saturday, when it&#039;s likely to be very busy. I did my weekly major grocery shopping so there were LOTS of other things in my cart besides the items I was using coupons for. I listed all the ones I tried in my first post but I don&#039;t have the motivation to do that again. Ummm.... Bounty paper towels, Febreze, Starbucks, California Pizza Kitchen, Tide, hmmmm what else...&nbsp; coffeemate, CheezIts, Welch&#039;s, Tropicana... there were probably a couple more. So I head to the self checkout because in the past you scanned your own coupons. Apparently that policy has changed; you have to call a cashier over and they enter the coupons for you. I got the overly-dedicated middle aged woman employee so of course she calls for the manager like a good little worker bee. They talk about me like I&#039;M NOT STANDING RIGHT THERE for a while, which indeed pisses me right off and I let them know. So finally the manager says, &quot;Well, let&#039;s just scan them and see what happens.&quot; WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE, BECAUSE THAT ULTIMATELY DETERMINES LEGITIMACY FOR YOU, DOESN&#039;T IT, BITCH? Uggghh, sorry, residual anger. Anyway, they all scan with no problem, then these bitches are falling all over themselves apologizing to me. <br /><br />I ended up saving $54 so they&#039;ve paid for themselves in the first trip. I think I&#039;ll just take one or two in the future and make sure they look better. I mean, I guess it shouldn&#039;t matter because they&#039;re supposed to be Smart Source and the like which you would print yourself, but anything that will help make it look more valid. I know there are a couple stores in my area that do not accept ANY printed coupons, period, so make sure you are aware of store policies before you head out. My boyfriend (for lack of a better term) tried to use the itunes one at a different local chain grocery and it didn&#039;t scan so he was denied. Not real worried about that one; I told him to try it at Target or Wal-Mart. <br /><br />TLDR - PL&#039;s coupons are amazing and you should buy them.

				So I&#039;ve learned the HC coupons are really not that easy to pass off. The past three weeks, I haven&#039;t had much luck on any of them. I also think Walgreens knows what&#039;s up, since every time I try to redeem a gift card, they&#039;re just not having it. I spoke to one Assistant manager, and he said that there was an email sent out to all the supervisors in which stated to be careful of fraudulent coupons. Stating that if it&#039;s to good to be true, it probably is. Maybe I just fucked over one to many walgreens, who know. CVS seems to be the same as well. It&#039;s disappointing since it really was sort of like a candy store for gift cards. I mean they carry like all of them. <br /><br />I tried a K-mart today with the Food Saver Vacuum coupon. This was actually the second time I tried it. It was denied both at Target, and K-mart. Just didn&#039;t ring up right. Supposedly K-mart is cracking down on coupons as well. I&#039;m going to try walmart tomorrow, since most people have had the best luck there. So far the OC coupons haven&#039;t failed though. Only thing is I can&#039;t seem to find the HP ink product UPCs to match the coupon. Sucks, since I really need some black ink. It&#039;s amazing how fast you blow through ink using these coupons. Worth it.<br /><br />To add, if you want a smoother transaction, profile the cashiers. I do my best to stray away from the older Cashiers, as they tend to take there job way to seriously. The younger ones really don&#039;t give a fuck. Hell they&#039;ll barely even look at the coupon. I swear the older ones analyze each and every one of them though. No one has time for that shit. It&#039;s just frustrating standing there with my thumb up my ass. Who cares though right, it&#039;s all about the savings.<br /><br />Hmm can&#039;t really add anything else to this. Just always make sure you have enough cash on you. Don&#039;t be afraid to ask questions even if a coupon is denied.

It can be easy to be once denied time and time again (for those of you on the Hardcore Coupons) Just remember it&#039;s a hustle.&nbsp; With rejection comes acceptance, experience, knowledge, and confidence.

				Anyone have any thoughts on location? I live in a small town, so it&#039;s very likely I&#039;m the first person using PL&#039;s coupons around here. However, I feel like that also brings more scrutiny. There&#039;s a nearby college town that&#039;s much larger; do you think it might be smarter for me to shop (and by &quot;shop&quot; I of course mean &quot;GET PAID TO TAKE THEIR STUFF&quot;) there?<br /><br />Also, where have you had success with the cigarette coupons? I don&#039;t feel like the gas station is gonna be real interested in taking one of those. <br /><br /><br />Edit: Hit up Target last night and cut a $100 total literally in half. FWIW, I picked the checkout with a young black dude who was joking around with everyone... he didn&#039;t even blink. I also had a three year old with me, so that might have helped too. But two separate coupons were above the price of the item and &quot;credited&quot; me the remainder to apply to the rest of the stuff. Thanks, Target! I&#039;ll take your money any day!

Start off w/ one or two coupons at a self-checkout, whatever dollar amount you feel comfortable with. Work up from there.

				I second Abbies advice....the OC coupons are a no brainer, I was nervous at first too, but if you want to go the extra mile throw some legit coupons in for good measure. I even throw in one of the expired coupons just to see what would happen, the checker shrugged and overrode it! The HC collection is definitely a more aggressive scam that takes some social engineer on a level you may never get to...but the OC is just good sense!

				@HEATfan Thanks man! I believe the HC listing has a disclaimer saying he will not sell it if you haven&#039;t bought the original first...but maybe its just salemanship or at PL&#039;s discretion...its not a bad idea to start out slow if you&#039;re not used to doing shit like this, I was definitely rusty but now its like people having been saying a rush! Viva la Coupons!!

				Just to clear the air... heatfan lucked out because his name sounded strikingly familiar to me as someone who had purchased all of my older listings in the past, so I filled the order. I was still sick and just trying to get caught up so rather than go back and forth in messages, I just filled the order and assumed he was another Miami heat fan I had dealt with before, but apparently they aren&#039;t the same person. Either way, I just want to be clear that I will not sell the HC collection to anyone who has not purchased one of my previous collections. It&#039;s an issue of safety plus other things. (example, it eliminates the teenagers who always want to jump to HC first since they don&#039;t buy groceries for themselves) <br /><br />But, I&#039;m glad things worked out HEATFan, glad to have you a part of the community.<br /><br />PL

				I bought the OC coupons today and plan on working with them first to get my feet wet before I jump in with both feet and get the HC listing. Printed off a few the coupons and plan on getting a start in the morning and see how they work. I also wanted to point out that the 10 dollar off the itunes has expired, I believe it expired two weeks ago. I took the Itunes 10 dollar off one to walmart on the way to the gym and handed it to the cashier and she questioned it and called a CSM who said if it scans to take it, anyway it did not scan and the cashier said her terminal stated it was expired sure enough it was. Do you think PL, that you could get that one updated.

				Yes of course I can. That coupon is expired because it was an after thought that was added into the collection. I am currently working on 100% expiration updates along with 100% CIC updates, this way even if a coupon currently not on the CIC list is still reportd to the CIC later, we will have changed all of the information ahead of time. This is a long and time consuming process, but it has been announced on the normal review thread to be 100% complete and uploaded by this time next week.<br /><br />So yes, it is all getting worked out as planned, a little bit behind schedule due to my recent health problems, but all is well now and they will be done with plenty of time to spare before the others expire.<br /><br />PL

If going to hoods, do you stick out? and vice versa if in affluent do they think your gonna rob them? I have gone about 23 times.&nbsp; I have had roughly 7 rejections.&nbsp; majority of them were in the same area and during afternoon.&nbsp; I find I do best on the evening shift.<br /><br />Im not trolling but I have realized you are not selling the idea of the authenticity of the coupon, but the authenticity of your character.&nbsp; If they trust you, they trust anything you give them. So being unshaven, dirty, really young, &quot;shady&quot;, etc plays a role.&nbsp; If i run up there in some COOGI with my pants down to my ankles nothing is gonna pass.&nbsp; Walk in there well dressed(think first date, not job interview), hygiene topnotch, well spoken, make eye contact, flirt/small talk helps.&nbsp; I have done as much as $110 and as little as $25 per store.&nbsp; I gauge by whos working the register.<br /><br />If I start running into rejections or hearing the memo thing I goto another district.&nbsp; All stores have gotten that memo.&nbsp; But I can tell you most do not read them.&nbsp; I stay away from foreigners.&nbsp; They are a pain in my fucking ass.&nbsp; Barely speaking english &quot;i no take this, i no see this before&quot; yea bitch of course you havent they dont have this shit in your 3rd world fucking country.&nbsp; Old people depend for me.&nbsp; Ive had store managers in their 40s and 50s not blink an eye, but had a younger woman deny me.<br /><br />I have not tried not the item coupons(other then a soda stream, it sucks worse $35 ever) the rest I have no desire for so I have not tried them.&nbsp; Wait i did use the xbox headset.&nbsp; worked flawlessly.&nbsp; Again your not selling the coupon, your selling yourself.<br /><br />I am doing trial runs sending my hot ass friend in.&nbsp; Shes done very well when its been a male behind the counter.<br /><br />Also I have had a few tell me no, then convinced them to just scan it.&nbsp; I walked out with my GCs lol.<br /><br />Btw I have used the HC at CVS, Walgreens, Kmart, Walmart.&nbsp; Never have they told me they were fraudulent. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey mate, no worries. I didn&#039;t take offense to your statement at all. I do my best to go well presentable. I&#039;m very well spoken and a bit of a compulsive liar. So I&#039;m able to get a good story going, and make sure it adds up. I&#039;m not as young as a teenager, but I&#039;m also not in my 40s. Unfortunately, since I think I could push these a bit farther if I did look older. Plus it sucks them having to scan your ID to purchase cigs. I only used the Cigarette coupon once because of this.You&#039;re right though when it comes to appearance. I went for another run today, with a fresh haircut, and changed my outfit a bit. It still was in the casual sense though. Had a bit better success. <br /><br />I see you get pretty lucky with the Gift Cards. That&#039;s pretty awesome. I haven&#039;t yet to be able to redeem one. Only xbox live if that counts. All the Walgreens, and CVS in my area always rejects the coupons, and one Walmart as well. I&#039;m not giving hope on other Walmarts though. I just haven&#039;t tried them out yet. Hell I&#039;ve even went as far as going into fast food chains to see if they accept them. Unfortunately three subways, and one Wendy&#039;s did. Didn&#039;t hurt to try though.<br /><br />I as well&nbsp; try to head to different parts of town, and I&#039;ll always try different stores out. You know, just to see. The whole memo thing of managers being told to watch out for coupon fraud sucks. I think that&#039;s the only thing that has stricken me a bit. Maybe I just to drive a bit further away from the areas I&#039;ve hit. I usually go about 20mins out, away from each area I hit.<br /><br />As far as how today went:<br /><br />Went to K-Mart first to see if they had any Playstation 3 Counsels. Unfortunately they did not. So thought I would go ahead and get some printer ink. I actually forgot if the UPCs on the box needed to match the HP ink coupon UPC since it is for all HP ink products. So since I didn&#039;t match, I didn&#039;t want to try. But if anyone can confirm there experience, since I don&#039;t remember a while back when I used this coupon if the UPC matched or not. Plus I wanted to keep that K-mart untouched of my coupons until they had something I wanted from the HC collection. So I just winded up stealing it. Sorry a bit of a Klepto, plus they really did make it to easy. <br /><br />So I headed to Walmart. I was really in the market for a FoodSaver Vacuum sealer. See it&#039;s kind of a must in my kind of work. It&#039;s legitimate I swear. (*Cough*) The coupon actually didn&#039;t go through at first. Two cashiers tried it, then this really cool, and pretty looking manager came over. Said what a good deal it was, and told the cashier to just minus $100 off the product. WIN! So that was pretty cool.

By doing this the cashier can just do her job (they dont care they are just there to scan shit) and we never need&nbsp; CSM to come by and see out ridiculous savings. The best part is by splitting it up we still save up to $200 on one visit to the store and we make out like ninjas in the night and no one is the wiser. Stealth. so to clarify my wife will do two separate transactions, while i am in a different lane also doing two separate transactions all while we are keeping below the $50 savings limit per transaction to maintain stealth.

				Ive done 15+ coupons at a shot, but like said above, i bet the cashier remembers me due to my handsome good looks and the fact i saved 90% off the items lol.<br /><br />I probably wouldn&#039;t do that again at my local stores, but i wouldn&#039;t think twice if i was on a trip with buddies, each with a few.<br /><br />These things work, and with changing the exp dates and keeping them off the clearnet, they should last a long time.

				i have used these very successfully and i will continue to, the idea is just keep it low but you could do it often but keep it under the rader its best to stay under the limit for saving or following the strict coupon policy and going multiple times then doing once big

				Hey newbie here but i made an account just to join the coupon thread. I purchased the oc&nbsp; collection about a month ago and had great results so I decided to go ahead and buy the hc. I was so excited to try them out I hit 14 stores over the weekend and was only turned down at 4. Not bad right?&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; I&nbsp; got mostly food gc but out of the 2 visa gc only 1 worked. It would show up invalid wherever I tried to use it and when I called to check the balance it said the number was invalid. I even returned the card to walgreens and they gave me another one and it done the same thing! I wonder if they are deactivating them immediately after the coupon is scanned? But I have been reading lots of complaints about vanilla visas on the clearnet too. Idk but I justed wanted to put that out there. Other than that everything has went smooth! PL is the man!

Skim through the thread a bit towards the beginning. Now you&#039;re also going to want to go ahead and check out the Main Thread as well. Maybe pages 1-10 or so. Though I most definitely encourage you to read a lot more. Everyone here, and there started exactly were you are at. After that, you can get started printing your coupons and saving money. One thing you should know is to not print all 200+ coupons at once. Do one first. If the coupon size and quality look good, now is the time you take to skim through which coupons you find of interest. You print those only. Make sure you check the dates on them as well.<br /><br />Most importantly, PAY WITH CASH!! You don&#039;t ever want to pay with a credit/debit card. Remember you don&#039;t want a paper trail.<br /><br />If any problem shall arise, just ask here in the forums, but you have to be a lot more specific then; &quot;So how&#039;s this work?&quot;<br /><br />Luckily I&#039;m so not low (High) at the moment, feeling nice, and a bit spunky (don&#039;t ask). So there you go.<br /><br />Cheers mate.<br /><br />Ninja Edit: Holy shit I had a shit load of typos. Sorry about that. I was just pretty high last night. Fun times.

				And I&#039;m $1,725 up JUST THIS YEAR on PL coupons, even AFTER the $305 I&#039;ve spent on PL&#039;s rockin&#039; products AND gas expense to get to out-of-town stores AND dry cleaning bill, to look like a respectable shopper. I haven&#039;t tracked the total coupon&nbsp; tonnage, just the net, but I must have passed NEARLY $2,500 worth of PL coupons in two-and-a-half months.

				Hello, this is my very first post on Silk Road, and I must say I&#039;m a little overwhelmed by what I&#039;ve jumped into, and I wasn&#039;t sure where to start, but after having had PL&#039;s coupons for about a week, I could wait to post in this thread no longer.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that PurpleLotus is a total bastard, and my life is now ruined because of him...<br /><br />HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO PAY FULL RETAIL FOR ANYTHING EVER AGAIN?!<br /><br />:D :D :D<br /><br />Seriously, this has been one hell of a week. So crazy. I... I just... FUCK, guys. FUCK.<br /><br />Can&#039;t find the receipt at the moment, but my most recent trip to wal-mart ended with a shopping cart literally overflowing with stuff. After a few test runs I decided to go balls-out and see just what I could do with these things. I wasn&#039;t even keeping close track of the total with or without coupons, so I must say there was a lot of anxiety coursing through me as I approached the checkout lane with a fat stack of coupons and about $40 in my pocket. I was prepared to leave as non-chalantly as possible if things went south, but it seems that my worry was for naught...<br /><br />I bantered with the cashier about the weather as she rang up my stuff, and holy shit was it hard to stay cool as I saw the total creep above $350 after tax. I then very politely handed her a stack of b&amp;w&#039;s that weren&#039;t even cut out very neatly and apologized for being &quot;an extreme couponer,&quot; which she assured me was perfectly fine. Being a newer walmart that isn&#039;t busy yet, and the middle of a Thursday, I had no line behind me. I&nbsp; even joked with her about how &quot;last time an old lady waiting in line got really nasty with me about the delay,&quot; and she replied, &quot;God! Some people are so rude!&quot; &lt;3<br /><br />She kept getting a bit more amazed each time the total slid downward, until I found myself with a cart so full I had bags tied to the handle (!) and a grand total after taxes of... wait...<br /><br />Motherfuckin&#039; wait for it...<br /><br /><br /><br />NINETY-TWO CENTS. :o :o :o [craps self with joy]<br /><br />I actually raised my fists into the air and shouted, &quot;Whoo-hoo!&quot; LMAO The CSM that came for the over-$50-key-turn said, &quot;That&#039;s some good shopping, sir.&quot; SO hard not to lose my shit right then and there. My. Fucking. God.<br /><br />That brings the total to probably close to a grand &quot;saved&quot; for the week. I put it in quotations because I think I would have normally spent about as much $ total, but now I have TEN TIMES AS MUCH STUFF. So many toiletries, so much food. I&#039;ve given away and eaten insane amounts and there&#039;s so... much... more.&nbsp; Ridiculous, stupendous, incredible, beyond description, life-changing, paradigm-shifting-to-the-next-dimension, I-have-no-more-superlatives-left-here-goddamn.<br /><br />And this is just using the OC collection a few times at a few stores. Haven&#039;t even really delved into the HC yet...<br /><br />If you have the $ and have not purchased this man&#039;s coupons yet, do yourself a few favors:<br /><br />1.) Fuck you, buy them<br /><br />2.)

I must say that sounds like one of the more amazing trips I&#039;ve heard about and the fact that it was in your first week is amazing! <br /><br />I love brand new stores because it means almost all of the employees are brand new too. Completely oblivious, untrained, and have not been working at the same Walmart forever. If I new store opens up anywhere around you it is GOLD!<br /><br />With that being said, I agree with wraithe, and let two weeks go by before you return after a score that big. Simply go hit other stores right now. Sounds like you found your honeypot, so make sure not to be &quot;that guy&quot; who cashiers recognize when he walks in the store. Not because you are in danger of getting into legal trouble, they still can&#039;t prove you knowingly accepted the fake coupons from me anymore than they did from you, but you do put yourself at risk of being told not to ever bring coupons back to that store and that would be a bummer.<br /><br />Also... I preach to people to start off small and work their way up. It&#039;s a good general rule, but as you mentioned, you were prepared for whatever might have happened, and not everyone always is, so that&#039;s why I always make that suggestion. People need to start small and work their way up, or fully understand what can happen if they hand over 35 coupons without finding out that the store they picked has a policy written right on the wall that says &quot;No internet coupons over $4 accepted.&quot; (That&#039;s just an example of the things that can happen)<br /><br />But, public warning aside, that was an awesome story and thank you for sharing it with us! Keep up the good work and I&#039;ll do the same for you,<br /><br />PurpleLotus<br />

				No, man, THANK *YOU.* :D I swear, if you aren&#039;t canonized after death, then our society is flat out DOING IT WRONG.<br /><br />I definitely spent a bit of time across a few stores working my way up. A coupon or 2 at walgreens here, some more a few 7-11&#039;s and targets there, etc. Did a pretty big one a different walmart several days before (maybe $340 -&gt; $90 after tax), and then was totally prepared to do whatever on that incredible-sized one. Hit a new target today, with enough to go from about $80 -&gt; $20. I won&#039;t be back to that wal-mart for a while. ROFL Luckily there&#039;s a fuckton of walmarts, targets, k-marts, grocery stores, etc. in my city...<br /><br />And if from nothing else than my own test runs, I knew that if I fucked up on the big one it would have been my own fault and no one else&#039;s.<br /><br />So many lighters and batteries! Jesus, I need several fishbowls to throw them into with a sign that says FREE, TAKE ONE ;) The coupons are amazing individually, but the real fun comes in when you can work the hell out of those overages and pay for a fair amount of non-coupon items.<br /><br />This is a hell of a rush, but I definitely feel the need to be cautious. No one told me the most addictive drug I&#039;d find on SR was motherfucking coupons!!!&nbsp; :o

				So... I&#039;m honestly kinda confused about how these work! If your purchase the coupons, is it for online purchases only? Or do your customers print them off themselves with a regular printer? Just wondering about logistics haha :)

				Holy crap.<br /><br />I found your listing last night for the first time and then stayed up until 5am reading the entire main thread (all 89 pages!). I don&#039;t want to sound overly sappy but I was almost weeping with joy when I was done - I currently assist an unemployed and physically disabled family member financially, and the strain of paying two grocery bills has been absolutely ruining my life over the past year or so. She lives on such a fixed income and has about $10 breathing room each month - this will wildly change that. I don&#039;t even use drugs (well, I smoke a little weed), I just find SR wonderful &amp; fascinating.<br /><br />Your coupons are going to literally change both of our lives... I sat up for a long time thinking about whether this was right for me to do or not, but in the end I really can&#039;t afford not to. I&#039;m trying to save up enough money and figure out how to get a BTC so I can get going with this before losing too many more paychecks to WalMart. I followed the whole saga of the online generator in one night, it was quite a roller coaster ride. <br /><br />Hopefully doing business with you soon.

				That&#039;s awesome, martine! I think that this will allow me to use moat of my tax refund to put a down payment on a car, so that I can coupon more effectively. LOL I was actuallly thinking today that when I&#039;m able, I want to get a grip of stuff and donate it to the food bank and homeless shelters here. I think that would be an incredibly awesome use of this wonderful resource. ;)<br /><br />I keep trying to think of what I&#039;d like to suggest for new coupon additions, and I keep running into problems because it&#039;s like I finally met Santa Clause and he&#039;s like, &quot;So yeah, here&#039;s a bunch of cool stuff, anything else?&quot; and then I fuckin&#039; stroke out and die at the sheer magnitude of the possibilities.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m forgetting something obvious and this is already way to many things to suggest, but perhaps someone else will second these (unless I&#039;m already already seconding; haven&#039;t read all of both threads quite yet):<br /><br />Bread- I know this has been mentioned several times and a few suggestions made, but I don&#039;t recall seeing Orowheat brand mentioned? They seem pretty ubiquitous, make a TON of different products, and almost all are good IMHO. A general $3 or $4 off coupon would be fuckin&#039; gold. <br /><br />Organic Valley and/or other Horizon Organic products- It might require a few coupons to really make full use of their line, but these two have some of the widest variety of (and most widely available) organic dairy and meat products, and that shit is obviously expensive. Meat and dairy are the two things I try to buy organic the most, and so virtually anything in this category would be like printing daily cash for me. The $3.50 off Horizon milk coupon is already EASILY one of my most used/beloved of the OC.<br /><br />Honorable mention: Coleman meat products. Not sure how widely available, but quite a few products that are either organic or &quot;all-natural,&quot; and all pretty high-quality.<br /><br />Not a big one but my girlfriend and I go through a fair number of Rosarita beans. Their vegetarian refried are the best canned refried beans I&#039;ve tried, and usually just over or under a buck for a 14oz can, so $1 off would be perfect.<br /><br />That reminds me, someone said a Goya coupon, which is fucking genius. Ton of products, all high-quality. Love using their chickpeas to make hummus. SO many products.<br /><br />OOO! Who here doesn&#039;t love Sriracha hot sauce? Yeah? Go drown yourself. :D Now, for the rest of us... actually a coupon for any Huy Fong Foods product would be totally fucking choice, as their chili pasts and chili garlic paste are fantastic also... otherwise, even a couple of bucks off the magical cock sauce itself would be better than Ancient Chinese Secret. (Note: I&#039;m aware that Sriracha is Vietnamese in origin and that I sound like an uncultured dickhead.)<br /><br />Something for any of the major brands of analgesics would be dope: Tylenol, Advil, Aleve. They all have pretty extensive product lines. One for each would be incredible, if I really wanted to be a greedy fuck.<br /><br />I think someone said flosspics? Love those things, use a shit ton. The Dentek are good, and they have a variety (as well as being pretty ubiquitous, once again). One of the few personal hygiene products I have left that&#039;s not covered by these coupons! Hehehe...<br /><br />My mom is unfortunately addicted to Afrin (Oxymetazoline) nose spray. :( I won&#039;t get into it, but she&#039;s tried to get off of it and it doesn&#039;t work, even in a clinical/hospital setting. They told her just to stay on it for now, and she gets the generic, but it&#039;s crappy and still costs like $2-3. The name brand is like $4-5+ even at big box stores, and outrageously priced ($6+) @ Walgreen&#039;s/CVS/etc. Any help with this would be overwhelmingly appreciated, given the amount she goes through. :/<br /><br />One thing I was thinking, and saw someone mention: produce? I know a lot of it does not *necessarily* come in packages with barcodes, but a lot of it *can* be found that way: apple, oranges, pears, onions, potatoes, tomatoes. I would need to examine them for a while since brands are constantly changing at stores, but I noticed that all of the barcodes I looked at *seemed* to be the same on a few different bags apples, despite being different varieties or brands even... they were just all 3lb bags, ranging in price from $3 - 6. A few bucks off those (again, if possible) would kick ass, and be a nicely healthy alternative to some of the incredible stores of junk food that now litter your customer&#039;s homes. LMAO (Note: I am NOT complaining.)<br /><br />I could be whiny and point out that my WM&#039;s only carry Kerr canning jars (not Ball), so a similar Kerr coupon would make me cream my pants, but again, now I&#039;m just getting greedy.<br /><br />Oh, hey, here&#039;s one I&#039;m surprised I haven&#039;t seen yet: Maybe $2 or 3 off any Georgia Pacific paper product? XD<br /><br />I WANT A T-SHIRT THAT SAYS &quot;I [HEART] PURPLELOTUS 4 EVER&quot;

				The URLs have no recently changed, and the next major plan for changing them will involve a very nice PurpleLotus website with very cool features, and also everyone will get their own account name and password, so it can be more individualized and I will have more control over things, and everyone will have more features. I have visions for the future, but for right now, yeah you just check the same link I issued to you and you will notice when the dates on the files change to today&#039;s date and then know they are new.<br /><br />I have a LONG amount of work to day today... as changing the expiration dates on hundreds and hundreds of coupons, which I didn&#039;t just leave until today to start, and also changing the databar so none of them match the CIC (even though only a small amount were on the CIC, I a still changing 100% of them so that anything currently circulating won&#039;t matter, because all our shit is 100% new now) and then of course I want to take them all and put them on the full page lay out with 3 coupons per page. To save us times, paper, ink, and of course to assist the few whohave issues printing them correctly. This is going to be the cleanest, most refinied release of the OC ever. And then finally I can go full force into my next set of projects for everyone.<br /><br />With that being said, guys can we please save all the questions both on the forum and in my inbox pertaining to tonight&#039;s release until after I officially announce that it is live. Then you are welcome to ask all you want, but for right now I need to just focus on this work.<br /><br /><br />Thanks every,<br />PurpleLotus

Wait, look better? HAHA yeah not just that, WORK BETTER! Mine work!

				Went shopping today at a few walmarts and a few bigbox drug stores to push the I tunes coupon thats in the&nbsp; OC collection. I am practicing with the I tunes before I get the HC collection. I went to the&nbsp; first walmart and got a 15 $ dollar card and handed it to the cashier she rang it up, she then scanned the coupon with her hand held scanner and it wouldn&#039;t scan, she called a CSM over and she was unable to get it to scan with the hand held as well. At this point I am starting to feel my heart pound as she calls her manager over. She took the coupon from them and scanned it with the big scanner built into the counter top and poof -10 $. She kinda scolded them for not knowing how to scan coupons and said she was sorry for the delay. Needless to say I now have 12 of these cards from about two hours running around town, worked every time by the way, without even a sideways glance. Thanks PL&nbsp; ;D Anyone have experience selling these on ebay. I see myself having a bunch of these by the end of next weekend since I have a trip to two large cities for work this week. Also can the itunes cards be bought at the uscans at walmart target ect

				Had a question for PL, and I apologize if this has been asked and answered previously...<br /><br />When the store submits these Q&#039;s to the manufacturer, won&#039;t the manufacturers or the coupon dispensers know the Q&#039;s are fake? Because if they do, then the store manager will catch on quick.<br /><br />Or is this system so foolproof that even the manufacturer will be fooled into paying the store for value on the Q?

				Finally on here! Now need my 50 posts hahahhahaha Sup everyone?? First of all i have to thank PL for being so fuggin awesome&nbsp; 8) Thanks for everyone contributing their time,minds and fingers to these forums. This is for the HC..... CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens seem like they know about the GC. &quot;We don&#039;t take coupons for FREE GC anymore.&quot;&nbsp; Suggestions--- Since its &quot;incentives&quot; maybe it should say, &quot;this certificate is good for&quot; or &quot;thank you participating in our survey, please enjoy one complimentary ______ on us&quot; As for the RCA tv, Kmart manager was really heated and was asking me a million questions about it, I was just like dude, i saw a tv on sale and googled for a coupon to get it cheaper, calm down. He got pissed and ripped the extended warranty out my hand. IDC I dont buy shit like that anyway lmao and the Kindle..... yea that didnt work anywhere lol toyrus guy stared at me as i gave it to him , never looked at it and was like, its fake. Staples called amazon and wanted my info, another staples said we dont take coupons like this. My whole point for this long ass post is, you have to have swag. Swag and fun. And PL is damn right start with the OC, then HC then you OG save u $$$$$$$

				first off&nbsp; big +karma to PL for making these.&nbsp; Second thought anyone want to do some idea sharing on the HC, like whats worked and what hasn&#039;t worked. I did get the PSP vita coupon to work at a walmart here. I should mention that they had 2 versions of the psp 1 was like 179 i think and the other was like 279. The coupon was for 200 off. I opted for the more expensive one and 2 managers showed up. gave them the song and dance how I filled out a survey for a 5 dollar off coupon for a game (which I told them I all ready used) and this 200 coupon was like a prize from a drawing from all the people that filled out the survey. The survey story played well with the coupon because well thats what it also says on the coupon. They all stood around eye balled it then scanned it and bam 200 off.&nbsp; <br /><br />So the question is what has been working for your guys in the HC and how can we all improve our game to pass them.

				I purchased the OG collections a couple days ago and couldn&#039;t be happier. These are extremely professional compared to the stuff I&#039;ve seen on clearnet, some more than others but all look good, and the collection is very expansive.<br /><br />PL and everyone else who is working on this project deserve a fucking medal. I&#039;ve had some awesome experience purchasing from SR and never thought that forged coupons would take the top spot. Keep up the good work guys!<br /><br />PS: POM juice and Camel cigarettes are enjoyed on a whole new level when you know you are getting raped in the wallet. Also, I&#039;ve learned that Oscar Myer bacon is fucking fantastic!

				Well I think it is time to share my experience with the OG collection from PurpleLotus. On Sunday morning, I went to a ghetto Walmart with a stack of PurpleLotus coupons and legit coupons. I used regular inkjet printer paper on &quot;Best&quot; and color.<br /><br />The first part was finding all the items scattered around the store and matching up the UPC. Unfortunately, there was only one register open and an older Hispanic employee manning the station. I made sure to let a colored lady go first so she didn&#039;t have to wait for a long time as I was greedy with a lot of merchandise.<br /><br />After the total came to $119, abuelito started scanning the coupons and after a few coupons, another old Hispanic female employee approached the register.&nbsp; :&#039;( They were speaking in Spanish about the coupons being a high amount such as $8 off Bounty and $10 off FoodSaver products. Similar words! As soon as the register locked up, the female employee went to call &quot;Superviso&quot;. Ten minutes later, another Hispanic lesbian employee who I assume was the supervisor came and used her magic key twice without even glancing at me and left.&nbsp; ;D<br />I believe this occurred because I used over $40 in coupons.<br /><br />The last employee was a mid 20s Indian &quot;Associate Manager&quot; who scrutinized the shit out of the coupons and told me they don&#039;t take Internet coupons. I raised my usually soft spoken voice slightly and told him their coupon policy says otherwise and asked the two other employees for their knowledge on the policy. They shrugged their shoulders and did not know.&nbsp; ::) <br /><br />Basically, he let the ones that were already scanned go through but would not scan anymore. I took a few products out and he voided the items. Paid only $36! Walked out with a cart full of groceries and smiled as soon as I reached my vehicle and made sure that no loss prevention was following me. <br /><br />tl;dr - $119 down to $36. TRY to start off small, check the store&#039;s coupon policy and match up the UPC and you&#039;re good to go! Already paid for itself as well in one shopping trip. <br /><br />Itching to use these at dozens of stores here and curious about using them at self-checkouts. Be sure to not use your store &#039;savings&#039; card or credit card linked to your real name/address. Just open up a new one if you do get savings with different info. Keep the stories coming please!

				@Koolaid<br /><br />I got the PS3 one to work at this ghetto Walmart. However, I think the guy may have just manually entered in the amount. But I was scared as fuck, they called 8 managers over to validate the coupon and my story. But in the end it worked like a charm and I walked out with a new PS3.

				I&#039;ve heard that the VISA cards expire w/in 24 hrs, but I&#039;ve also heard that they can take a day to initially be activated. Bottom line, every other gift card I&#039;ve had or heard of has had zero problems after you leave the store.<br /><br />Buy some glossy paper, adjust your printer settings, pick up a Shell card from CVS, RiteAid, etc every week or so and you may never buy gas again.&nbsp; ;D

				Not to be picky - and I am, as always, impressed with not only the product, but most of all the customer service that PL provides. But, the $9 Dr Scholl&#039;s coupon seems to be missing in the latest OC update.<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m overlooking it or it was retired, but it used to be in the Coupons3 file and I can&#039;t find it anywhere now.<br /><br />BTW, I owe you at least a hundred bitcoins for all the savings thus far, PL. If I can get some this weekend, I&#039;m planning on tipping at least a couple.<br /><br />Many, Many Thanks, as always.

I did the same thing and found it immediately for them (just by clicking on &quot;show posts&quot; from their profile) ... so, it happens, but I did just want to make clear that we moderators are only permitted to delete spam, scams, and posts that endanger someone.&nbsp; So you are free to post anything you want as long as it isn&#039;t that bitcoin spam, isn&#039;t a scam of some sort, and doesn&#039;t reveal any personal info or addresses.&nbsp; :)

				Just bought the OC last night, couldn&#039;t wait to try it out!<br /><br />Just hit up my local Walmart with the following:<br /><br />Lactaid -$3<br />brita pitcher filter -$5<br />planters nuts -$3<br />Redbull 4pk -$5<br />Sbux Frap 4pk -$4.50<br />Hanes Socks (-$5) &amp; Undershirts (-$7.50)<br />$15 Itunes GC - $10<br />Bic stationary -$4.50<br /><br />Added on some seltzer and one small 12oz bottle of soda, came to $14.92 with tax down from $50.15. The Itunes GC didn&#039;t scan, so I asked the girl to take it off the bill please. Maybe I printed it too small, who knows?<br /><br />I didn&#039;t have to give any story or flirt or what have you, but as I was emanating a shield of nonchalance the woman behind me excitedly spoke up &quot;Those are some nice coupons!&quot; I was caught a little off guard but told her &quot;lots and lots of surveys, thanks.&quot; as well as &quot;takes a while to get the good ones, but you know how it is. Your hours get cut, less cash coming in, so you&#039;ve gotta do what you gotta do.&quot;<br />Apparently, she was just happy to see someone so craftily using coupons. Although she may not know it, she sends her Kudos to Lotus-hood of SilkRoadingham, as do I!<br /><br />...so excited to pick up the HC when both my cojones and wallet allow me to do so...<br />

				YEah site is having issues today. It&#039;s rare but every couple of months it will be down for a day or less, try again in a few hours if you have issues, it will be back up soon.<br /><br />Also onionsone, yeah I know your a fan and of course you can pick a coupon from my HC collection and message me for a sample (this is only an option for customers who bought the OC, prospective customers can feel free to ask for a sample from the OC only) <br /><br />EDIT: I originally got too defensive about your question, you weren&#039;t asking for advice on how to use another vendors coupons, you were just asking if they worked. <br /><br />Also, go check out my main forum, and you&#039;ll find the answers to your questions whether you bought my listing or not... but don&#039;t ask until you&#039;re my customer.<br /><br />The answer is yes they work, but as you are finding out, some areas are much more reluctant to accept them than others. You can get a good idea of how well they are working for others by reading my main thread.<br /><br />:-)&nbsp; I&#039;m glad you gave me the chance to make those statements. You know I&#039;m a huge fan too.<br /><br />PL<br /><br />

I&#039;m too cheap to use color ink, is the image I want to give out. With the HC collection color is preferred but I still only use black toner.<br /><br />I will sell you both of them at the same time as of right now, but with a bit of a lecture on suggested use. If you think you want them both, and have the coins now, then feel free to place the order. BTC prices are volatile, and I don&#039;t want to see something happen where suddenly a week from now you are $20 short when you had the money today.

				Ok...just a quick update. Made my biggest run to date. I got my first paycheck from the new gig yesterday and finally had cash to do it up! So we hit Target first, my GF and I split up a list and coupons and then meet up after the register. I had my first hater! IO hit a register up with an old white lady and she immediately started questioning my coups....first time anyones given me grief on the OC...she went and came back with 2 yopunger black women...both of them sat behind her while she scanned everything, the old woman questioned the first few...the black ladies both told her..if they scan they good! I heard on say they get them from survey sites..and the other pointed out one and said I had one of those yesterday...they&#039;re fine. Total savings for me was $71 and change...my girl was 2 registers over and did $55..the only real issue was the new Glad Coupon came up as INVALID...on to Walmart...same tactic, I had no issues...I did figure that the Edy&#039;s fruit bars are also the same SKU as Dreyers!! woohooo,,,we have been experimenting with different products on the same coupon...I did $48 no problem at my register...only to look over and see my girl about to blow! The older Black lady at her register had started questioning her coups trying to say if they didn&#039;t scan without the gun she couldn&#039;t take them...I tried to calm my girl down but ultimately we had to leave the groceries...we could have worked it out I&#039;m sure..but it had been a long day and there was nothing important..i told the manager I would be sending in a complaint...we were very indignant...our counterfeit coupons aren&#039;t good enough for y&#039;all??? we bitched all the way home..then had a good laugh...out to the gym and then over to the next town for GC shopping..take it sleazy guys.....

				Just bought a near free VISA gift card at CVS, feeling like a boss! <br /><br />To anyone looking how to use the VISA coupons start small and use the $20 off the $25 dollar VISA card, because the cashiers don&#039;t need manager approval to accept coupons under $30 (At least at the CVS&#039;s in my area). Also from my experience hit drug stores for gift cards, not Target, Walmart, and K-Mart.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CVS is by far the best, then Walgreens, and lastly RiteAid.<br /><br />Thank you PurpleLotus for the amazing coupons!<br />-PL can you also update the date on the PS3 survey coupon it expires on 4/1/13. That is the only PS3 coupon I have gotten to work because it looks too legit.

Only one card per store and I didn&#039;t dawdle, was in and out in a couple of minutes, most of that spent waiting for the shift/whatever manager to walk across the store and scan hir rubber-stamp approval. <br /><br />I got King Crimson&#039;s &quot;Easy Money&quot; playing in my head now.

				I hear PL is releasing full-page Amex and MC coupons. I&#039;ve been listening to the $100 VISA debriefings and wondering if I should try that out. What I really wonder is will Amex and MC be slower in deactivating their cards...or maybe not deactivate them at all. :)<br /><br />From the looks of the pp/eb transfers that some are using to safe-harbor the VISA funds, it might not even matter (if pp doesn&#039;t make that too much trouble to use for long.)<br /><br />I do believe that if we were to enumerate all of the plausible routes whereby one could make - not just save - money off of PL coupons, it would number in the hundreds or thousands.

				And I&#039;ll be DAMNED, pun intended, if I haven&#039;t been rockin&#039; the Chick-Fil-A coupon lately. I ate them or McD&#039;s for every meal this weekend.*<br /><br />The &#039;secret&#039; is to USE THE DRIVE-THRU and do NOT warn them that you&#039;ll be using a coupon, when you place your order. Give them the minimum amount of time to refuse you and the maximum incentive to get you moving and out of their drive-thru line.<br /><br />*I skipped breakfast - which is nutritionally and metabolically inadvisable - and I am lame, being too cheap to use my free Wendy&#039;s, Subway, Domino&#039;s or even fucking Chick-Fil-A giftcards, when I can just swindle some teenie cashier with a piece of paper AND get to leer at her at boob level.&nbsp; ;D (Yes, I am an awful human being.)

				Whatever you may think about Chick-Fil-A, I have to give at least one of their managers an A+ for customer service, as well as looking out for her employer&#039;s bottom line. After her well-trained and intelligent cashier noticed that my (fraudulent) coupon was for a regular combo, not the grilled chicken I ordered, the manager politely informed me that the coupon was part of an Internet scam.<br /><br />And then she STILL GAVE ME THE FREE COMBO, saying that she didn&#039;t want to penalize me for getting caught up in a scam! +1 Karma!<br /><br />Anyway, I hope that they catch whoever is scamming poor Chick-Fil-A on the Internet...as long as the free grub (and other consumer goods) keeps coming my way.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />EDIT: By &quot;well-trained and intelligent&quot;, I do not mean to imply that the cashier did not have a sweet pair of sugar tits, but I was a bit too distracted by her objection to give them proper attention. (I am getting old.) The manager, on the other, um, hand, was older and would not have normally sparked much interest in me, but given her pleasant disposition I can (and am) imagine some raunchy three-way action with her and the cashier. Again, as previously noted, I am a truly despicable person.

				I don&#039;t post much, but I wanted to drop by and show my support for PL.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mostly all of us are aware that you can find resources out there on how to make your own coupons, free of charge.&nbsp; But to me, the one time fee you pay for PL&#039;s coupon packs are WELL worth the money.&nbsp; Not only do you get a very solid and already put together list, he also updates them regularly.&nbsp; I personally am too busy to make 200+ coupons every couple of months, and am beyond thankful that PL provides this service, and would consider it a steal at thrice the price&nbsp; &nbsp;It is certainly the best money I have spent on the Road, and in the top 5 of the best money I have spent all time.&nbsp; I have not only stocked a full house of items, but give plenty to friends, family, charities, and people I know who are living on the edge, barely making ends meet.&nbsp; I even have friends who are educators, who offer their services free of charge to under privileged children in other countries.&nbsp; Every time they go, or have a fund raiser, or w/e, I always send them with a massive care package to help these people get items that they don&#039;t even have access to, little lone the kind of access we have using these coupons.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually sending a package this week, with a friend who is going to be teaching school as a volunteer for the next month.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I hope this gets rectified and PL is exonerated and exulted&nbsp; as the extremely good and helpful person that he is.&nbsp; Regardless, I am very thankful for the service that PL has provided, and I for one, can verify that the under-privileged world, is a little better off because of this service.&nbsp; &nbsp;

What I started, is going to live on in epic fashion.&nbsp; With more people, more humility, more epicness, and most of all MORE COUPONS!<br /><br />You might slay me, but you can never slay the giant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Me and nick are thinking about releasing a joint SR edition coupon pack in commemoration of your suspension. We are going to call it &quot;GOA&quot; or (Gaping purple asshole.) Maybe you can rip us off and post it at BMR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>First I want to say I did not want to get into this at all. <br />BUT<br />This is not true what so ever. No way am I affiliated with coachella nor am planning any joint pack. And I think you just need to stop posting in PL&#039;s threads. You coming in here and harassing him is not helping your situation in any way. And you are a vendor too? Get it together man. To be a vendor here on SR you must have respect for all, and if you act like a douche, no one is going to want to purchase from you. And you&#039;re not helping your case here on not being a douche. Just let it be.<br /><br />Ever since day 1 I have just wanted to come here and mind my own business and be an asset to the SR community. And during that journey I have been harassed by PL and I suppose, some of his close friends on here constantly. And it has been tough for me because of that. In my opinion, the best way to be a vendor on here is do your own thing and be an upstanding SR member. And if you are, no troubles or drama will come your way. <br /><br />I do not know why PL had his account banned. I am sure he is pretty bummed about the situation. But honestly, to get banned from SR you have to do some pretty serious damage. This website is illegal and we all want to be safe. So for PL to have been banned, he had to violate that code that SR is all about. And I have absolutely no sympathy for him for violating that code.

				Hey I&#039;ve got a quick question, hopefully someone can help me out. You see, there&#039;s this seller who sells much better coupons than I do. When I say better, I mean they&#039;re much better quality than the one&#039;s I steal from people on 4chan. My coupons are so shitty that I don&#039;t make any money&nbsp; :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;( I tried hijacking his thread by trying to discredit his coupons, I reworked the coupons he made to be even shittier, and I even told everyone how easy it is to make shitty coupons that are obviously shitty but it didn&#039;t work :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;( :&#039;(<br /><br />I was thinking I could come up with a way to get the other seller banned, you know like make complaints with my army of alt accounts alleging all kinds of bullshit that&#039;s never happened. That way, he&#039;ll get banned and I&#039;ll be able to disappoint customers with my shitty, non-working coupons! What do you think guys?<br /><br />Seriously coachella, go fuck yourself bro. After all the immature bullshit you&#039;ve pulled in this and the original thread, do you really think anyone wants to do business with you? Now I&#039;m not on PL&#039;s dick but I&#039;ll make sure to redirect everyone I can to the original thread(I already made copies of what you said because I know your bitchass is gonna go back and edit them) to see what a&nbsp; whiny little cocksucker you really are. Even if you succeed in getting PL out, your shitty coupons that you stole from 4chan will be nothing more than a hair-lipped reminder of&nbsp; PL&#039;s coupons.
