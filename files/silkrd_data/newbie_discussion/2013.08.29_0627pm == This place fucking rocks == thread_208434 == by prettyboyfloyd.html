				Sure does! Beyond fucking belief in fact. What we who aren&#039;t spoiled brats have been waiting for all these years. Not that you&#039;d know it from all the pissing and moaning going on. Good to see someone else appreciates what this is. Never in history has something like this been even conceivable. I personally have had a great time, dealt with nothing but fantastic vendors, and generally fulfilled all my longstanding psychedelic urges on SR. NEVER BEEN SCAMMED in dozens of purchases, so it is possible if you put the effort into it. No one is here to hold your hand.

SR is a subversive attack on the morale of LE, no doubt, and a poke in the eye of those who think taking away our right to alter our consciousness is a feasible thing to do. If the war on drugs is a battle, I think of TOR drug markets as a surprise cavalry charge to the enemy&#039;s flank. I am sure they never saw it coming. But to be truthful we are a tiny lucky minority in a sea of drug use, addiction, violence, and incarceration. Simply the fact that we are enjoying this forum means we have a relative level of wealth, access to technology, education and tech savvy that most drug addicts don&#039;t and likely won&#039;t. Because of this (privilege) we have a little niche carved out that lets us explore this stuff and brag about our liberties without as much fear of being thrown in the joint. Just remember there are still millions of people living hellish realities in prison and on the streets because of draconian and irrational drug policies (worse in the US, true, but certainly no picnic anywhere) Sorry to be so serious but I think it needs keeping in mind while we play around on the road. If you ever get the chance to do something to change these laws, join a protest movement, or speak up about it to your family and friends, please have the courage to do so. Thanks :)
