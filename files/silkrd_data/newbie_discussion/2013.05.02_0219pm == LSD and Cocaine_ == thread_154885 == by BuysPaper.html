				Candy flipping is fun, lots of fun. Unfortunately, I cannot obtain real MDMA, all I can get is dodgy powder in my country, and I&#039;m cautious about ordering powders from a non-domestic seller.<br /><br />I can however, get high quality cocaine, and I am now curious, has anybody ever tried taking cocaine and LSD at the same time? If so, what is it like?<br /><br />Obviously I would need to wait til the LSD peaks and probably have a shitty time as I crash on cocaine while still tripping, but it might be worth it.<br /><br />Anybody care to add their opinion on this?

				I&#039;m not a fan of cocaine, only pscyhadelics, but i&#039;ve always heard that cocaine will blow your trip.&nbsp; MDMA will lessen a trip, so waiting til your L is peaking would be the best bet.&nbsp; So you don&#039;t waist it.

				I don&#039;t know from which country do you come from, but it&#039;s not very risky to buy powders (cocaine or mdma crystals) from a non-domestic vendor if you made sure he/she ships under careful stealth conditions. moisture barrier bags (MBBs or MMBs) block any odor and moisture trying to leave its container. but if you&#039;re still concerned about ordering internationally then go stick with domestic vendors. <br /><br />adding coke to your candyflip or lucy trip will be very contradicting! it&#039;ll crush your nice trip in the best case ending it immediately or in the worst cause anxiety and weirdness. I wouldn&#039;t recommend it. although some say that it could be used in case of a bad trip to get out of it.

				I think the cocaine high will make the lsd feel weaker and not so trippy.

				i agree with josepepe.. cocaine will just dull the lsd high. lack of euporia from cocaine wont help the lsd, energy rush might but whats the point of lsd if not to experience the fullest high?
