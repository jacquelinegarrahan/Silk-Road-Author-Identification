				You&#039;ll need to purchase a vendor account, this can be done by going to &quot;Account&quot; -&gt; &quot;Become a Seller&quot; on SR. The wiki (link below) states that it costs $180, although I believe it to be $500 from what I&#039;ve read on the forums, someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong. There is also a link to the &quot;Seller&#039;s Guide&quot; on the &quot;Become a Seller&quot; page.<br /><br />Starting a Vendor Account<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Starting_a_Vendor_Account

				So its really not possible to sell a small amount of something less than 100 bucks and still earn something? Should be a option where you could pay each week or each month or something.. <br /><br />It would drag more money and sellers(but maybe scammers as well)

				You can sell lots of things under 100 dollars? Most vendors here are fairly proffessional and have enough cash flow to pay the upfront fee. That is just a small portion of what it actually takes to start vending. Depending on what you are selling, you need a lot of diverse shipping equipment. It takes a lot of logistics to get everything crankin&#039;. I&#039;m just in the beginning process and it has taken quite awhile to get everything in order. Good luck to you!

				To be able to sell&nbsp; first priority is to get&nbsp; very well informed by reading a lot, because there is&nbsp; a lot involved, communications package pgp ect..<br />I,ve seen a lot people whit this question until they found out it,s not that simple to become a professional vendor,they let it go.

I feel as if decrypting PGP&#039;s and sending out packages in stealth would be quite easy. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s stressful, but it couldn&#039;t be too difficult to figure out..

(e.g selling leftovers if you buy lets say 5g and you just need 3 then you have 2 you could have sold or just if you want to sell some small amounts some times to earn some money for use(or even food) or something, then its a little expensive with just one solution often, but i can see why it is like it is)<br /><br />But when we are &quot;at the topic&quot;(at least me) can you open your own page at the tor network, like .onion ? And if you can is it a lot of work? Its interesting how it really works, even though i have used tor/vidalia almost since it came out, i still get impressed!:)

				Sure you could start your own hidden service, but how are people going to find it? You are going to need a Server and you just can&#039;t (or rather, shouldn&#039;t) go over to Jimmy&#039;s Server Emporium and tell him hey Jimmy I need a Tor Hidden Service Server STAT.

				It costs 500 dollars for a sellers account now. You would have an easier time just selling your &quot;leftovers&quot; to friends or people you work with.
