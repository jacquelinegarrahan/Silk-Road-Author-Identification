				They aren&#039;t going to launch shit. The closest they&#039;ll get is shelling some disputed area, which they&#039;ve done in the past. <br /><br />The only people that want a war are certain contingents in the US military. North Korea wants to build support and legitimize their new, young, inexperienced leader and build his support within their own military ranks. Its important to secure this support to prevent coups in the future. Additionally, they want appeasement from the US and other western nations. Financial aid, weakening sanctions, etc. Its the same sort of thing they&#039;ve done for decades. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t put it past the US to goad them into making a blunder and using it as the basis for war, but thats the only realistic way I can see it happening.

				That will never happen. NK needs food aid, and when it is low, they do some ranting to get other nations to bribe them with food aid so they shut up. Open war will never happen because NK administration knows that they will be destroyed instantly, and no other nation will bomb NK because the humanitarian crisis taking care of citizens NK would bankrupt any nation or organization of the Treaty on the planet. The most recent estimates put just labor alone about six to ten humanitarian workers for every citizen that NK is just to provide medical care and nutrition, not to mention the exorbitant costs of food aid emergency and infrastructure construction. Never happen.

				It is also worthwhile to note that &quot;NK made ​​threats -&gt; other nations get pissed -&gt; NK says he back down for food aid -&gt; other nations shed some food aid to NK to silence&quot; is a cycle that repeats once or twice a decade.

				This is also unlikely. China wants NK to exist because it is a buffer zone between the borders of China and NATO friendly nations. If NK falls to a NATO or ally, China must pay close attention to the Sino-NK border.

				Original plan for the post consisted of cheap satire of growing legal cannabis in NK but fuck it I shall go on!<br /><br />North Korea has recently (most likely) suffered from US sanctions and with the recent changes in power it creates a quite volatile situation for a nuclear &#039;power&#039; in Asia.<br />The main question is whether America has more rights to nuclear power/weapons than N.K?<br /><br />America is very unstable in many ways and could collapse at any moment for all we know leaving a &#039;rogue&#039; nation with a lot of military power which is damn scary given this technological age where military software can be manipulated by others .<br /><br />Hopefully with the help of Bitcoin we move towards prosperity and peace as we leave behind a culture which is hardwired to be &#039;dependent&#039; on leadership,government and the tax man to order or instruct people how to live their lives. <br />A decentralized society could work,thrive and flourish under a free market system leaving behind our feudal/corporate structure which is freely exploited by those in power who have created the largest wealth gap between rich and poor ever in history.<br />*caution ramble* /\

				Of course North Korea won&#039;t start a war on purpose. It would be their demise and they know it. I just wish China would try to make them a little more reasonable with their own people. Imagine if the plans from that German hacking con go into effect and they launch a satellites with an uncensored internet connection available to every one. The shock the North Korean people would experience of the reality of the outside world. We (Americans) don&#039;t hate them. In fact most every one I talk to only pities them. Every facet of their lives controlled, every one a potential enemy (even family) that could ruin your life, no access to uncensored information, the common people starve while fatboy and his cronies stuff their faces. Our lives and country aren&#039;t perfect by a long shot but it&#039;s still better than the alternative. Is it any wonder that just getting Arab countries modernized is better at curbing Islamic Fundamentalism than shelling their hospitals and mcdonalds? Information is the most powerful weapon any one can wield. Eventually these dictators no matter where they&#039;re from won&#039;t be able to hide from the overwhelming tide of the information age. They will fall by the pen (or electron communicated word) not the sword.

				&nbsp;NK NEWS receives regular reports from visitors returning from North Korea, who tell us of marijuana plants growing freely along the roadsides, from the northern port town of Chongjin, right down to the streets of Pyongyang, where it is smoked freely and its sweet scent often catches your nostrils unannounced. Our sources are people we know who work inside North Korea and make regular trips in and out of the country.<br /><br />There is no taboo around pot smoking in the country—many residents know the drug exists and have smoked it. In North Korea, the drug goes by the name of ip tambae, or “leaf tobacco.” It is reported to be especially popular amongst young soldiers in the North Korean military. Rather than getting hooked on tar and nicotine like servicemen in the West, they are able to unwind by lighting up a king-sized bone during down time on the military beat.<br /><br />&nbsp;The reasons for smoking weed in North Korea differ from America. In North Korea, you don’t smoke just to get high and laugh at your own hand, you do it to save money and as a break from the ubiquitous cheap local cigarettes. In the black markets of North Korea, marijuana is commonly sold at a cheap price and is easily obtainable. Therefore, the drug is especially popular among the lower classes of North Korean society. After a day of hard manual labor, it is common for North Korean workers to smoke marijuana as a way to relax and soothe tight or sore muscles.<br /><br />One of the great bits of North Korean mythology we’ve all heard a million times is that citizens may not fold their newspapers, lest they accidentally fold a picture of their leaders. But luckily not every page features those powerful, attention-seeking bossmen, so all the paper’s more easily recyclable parts (sports, weather, TV listings) end up being used to roll up tobacco and marijuana.<br /><br />The Rodong Sinmun newspaper is a favorite rolling paper among many North Korean smokers. It is cut up into squares, then rolled into small, cone-shaped spliffs. A source confirmed to NK NEWS that they had found a half-lit joint on the ground in a rural area of the country with the Rodong Sinmun used as rolling paper. The same source noted that, tragically, the weed in North Korea isn’t very strong.<br /><br />&nbsp;Although weed grows naturally on the Korean peninsula, it is cultivated more formally in some areas. The herb is often grown in the private gardens of North Koreans. An American who travels to North Korea every year commented on Reddit, “We came to a garden one day and took one look and said, ‘that is weed!’ We went over and sure enough they were growing marijuana. I had heard it is used for medicine but finding it was interesting.”<br /><br />Reports of marijuana use date back to the formation of the nation as it exists today. After the Korean War, US soldiers commonly plucked the herb from the DMZ areas near the North Korean border and smoked it. Stories of tents being hot boxed by tired fighters is a common recollection in the folklore of the difficult era.<br /><br />Meanwhile back in the West, with the recent legalization of marijuana in Washington state and Colorado, some Americans are clamoring for legalization of the herb across the whole country. While this remains a controversial issue, the fact that marijuana appears to be commonly used in North Korea as a casual, cheap escape from an otherwise tightly controlled society suggests that for all the other worries they have to put up with, they do enjoy at least one perk denied to people like me living here in the land of the free.

				Yeah, I vaguely remember reports about activity at their chemical weapons dumps a few months ago. Good to hear that aid is getting in. <br /><br />I feel for whomever got hit with Sarin...it&#039;s nasty stuff. Pretty fascinating pharmacologically speaking, but pretty horrifying. <br />The Nazis had it before WWII but they decided against using it for fear of reprisal...systematically murdering 6 million + Jews and 10-11 million others was perfectly ok, but Sarin...no that&#039;s over the line. <br /><br />

				They&#039;d be suicidal if they did. Considering the regime is more than half a century old, I&#039;d say they&#039;re not.<br /><br /><br />You&#039;ve got China on one border who&#039;s not going to appreciate having it&#039;s number one trading partner nuked. And unlike North China&#039;s got a real arsenal. They&#039;re getting pretty sick of NK anyway.<br /><br />Then there&#039;s Russia on another border, which another country with a real nuclear arsenal. And post-Soviet Russia may not be our best ally, but they&#039;ll back the US over NK most days.<br /><br />India&#039;s right there with nukes too. And they&#039;re definitely a US ally.<br /><br />Pakistan has the capability. I&#039;m not sure they&#039;d launch an attack in retaliation, but they might.<br /><br />And obviously US. And those are just the countries in closet proximity to NK. The UK and France have the ICBM capability to reach NK (the US, the UK and France are 1, 3, and 4 out of 8 -- NK would be 9 if they had an actual deliverable weapon)<br /><br />Not to mention that NK doesn&#039;t have the ICBM technology capable of reaching the continental US (I dunno --- maybe Hawaii --- possibly Guam). And they MIGHT have all of one warhead. Didn&#039;t they just fake a monkey space launch last year? LMFAO!<br /><br />North Korea needs food more than anything. They need global help with that. Since they&#039;re not (and never will be) capable of conquering the world, I think it&#039;s safe to say it&#039;s not happening.<br /><br />It&#039;s called propaganda. They engage in saber rattling to make the people forget that they are impoverished, oppressed, and starving.<br /><br />Nuclear attack? Not so much.<br /><br />

				Danggit -- I thought this thread was going to be a new meth vendor.&nbsp; Here tell them Northers make some killa fire.<br /><br />&quot;Perhaps in an effort to numb themselves of the daily grind of a delusional dictator amid widespread starvation, North Koreans have turned en masse to the &#039;bingdu&#039; or ice. As the WSJ notes, a study in the Spring of 2013 found that &quot;Almost every adult in that area (of North Korea) has experienced using ice and not just once,&quot; and the author noted that &quot;at least 40% to 50% are seriously addicted to the drug.&quot; Unsurprisingly for the closed nation, there is no official data, but as poppy fields disappeared in the nation, meth dealers were quick to step in and &#039;Heisenberg&#039; the people&#039;s needs. Now &quot;doing ice is a social thing; it is a lot of fun,&quot; as the &#039;epidemic&#039; has spread from mid-ranking officials and police officers in 2004-2008 to the general population of students and youth now.&quot;
