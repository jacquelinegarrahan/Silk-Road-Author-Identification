				As the Subj.says,i like the advice given,and the only exception should be for new customers buying....yes?<br />However,after dealing with Charas Bros,to name but one,why do they stipulate,that there will be no ESCROW,irrespective of no`s of previos buys ,stats for return etc,its all FE,for everyone.<br />The offer of Airmail and signed for,with tracking would be ESCROW,unless i`ve misread,however,this option is now no longer there,so the vendor is on to 100%winwin sitch.<br />Don`t use these vendors,newbs are told,but how about said vendors being told thats the policy of SR,tow the line or ship out-NO FE.<br />There`s obviously more to this than meets the eye as this seems to be such a simple method to stop such blatant disregard for protocol of SR.<br />Don`t use them is the message but if you want a product and they are the only vendor that supplies it,what do you suggest...........<br />All input appreciated,cheers,be lucky...................................B

				I&#039;m quite fine with sellers requesting first-time buyers do an immediate FE as long as they have large quantities listed, 300+ transactions under their belt, and feedback in the high 99s too. Why? It&#039;d be insane for them to selective scam a small first time buyer. Yes, it&#039;s quick money; but it could jeopardize important repeat buyer accounts. Just don&#039;t throw much money on the table or go with a seller who&#039;s reputation isn&#039;t sterling and therefore something they want to guard above all.<br /><br />Why FE? Dolts do things like give a fake address and then whine that their drugs don&#039;t come. Seriously.
