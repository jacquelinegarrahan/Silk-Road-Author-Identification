				Thought I may get some feed back on what XTC pill you guys think is the best. I always try them before I sell any. For me the White SKULL about 300mg was the strongest but Mortal Kombats or Red Dragons are the best for me this year about 200mg MDMA. What do you guys think?

				I&#039;ve tried a good few from the road. My fave were the Lamborghini shields, best I&#039;ve had in years- just awesome. Felt so much nicer than the partyflocks, which i thought were shit and the MKs. Just placed an order for some Supermans which are from the same presser as the Lambos. They&#039;ve been getting some good reviews on PR. Tried some of Supertrips green ? and for a med dose pill thought they were pretty banging too. And the Blue Ghosts are great.

				The only X pill that ever really did me decent was the Paul Frank Monkeys back in 08 to 09 maybe early 2010.&nbsp; Then they went bunk.&nbsp; After that I had gotten 2 purple g ladies from this dude at Ultra.&nbsp; He was from NY and was with about 20 other people.&nbsp; i thought the purple g ladies were X but ended up finding out 2 weeks later on pillreports or edata, one of the 2 that they were bzp and tmfpp, but i was still fucked up like no other.&nbsp; Both of those hit me harder than 1 monkey.&nbsp; Also that night at ultra i got to try 2Ci for the first time.&nbsp; I will never forget that episode in my life.&nbsp; It was my first music festival I had ever gone to and had some of the most memorable time in 1 day/night combined.&nbsp; I wish I still spoke to that dude from NYC....I had his number for all of a month and his friends number too.&nbsp; Found out all they did was travel to festivals back to back.&nbsp; The guy that I got them from was also a Professional Party Thrower from NYC.&nbsp; Dude had a bald head and was dripping in sweat when I first spoke to him.&nbsp; &nbsp;Him and his friends were so nice and fun to hang out with that night.&nbsp; I will never forgot that 1st time.<br /><br />Now these days, are the E pills the same as they were years ago or is the molly crystals better?

				I was thinking back to when I tried bzp. Thought it was x and these were big purple with 3xon them. I felt great for about 2 hours then felt hot. I just wanted it to go away. Dam think lasted about 6 hours. Never again.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I did have a very warm chest feeling that night... Even driving back home I felt like I was floating while driving (I know not smart) but my X I was with at the time, she was wayy too gone to drive.&nbsp; The only thing that actually helped me come down from those 2 g ladies and the 2ci was sipping the rest of my EnJ Brandy.&nbsp; Felt amazing after I woke up....<br /><br />I also remember I was so fucked that night I couldnt even fuck her if I tried, i was that gone

				I like supertrips green? I pop one then wait 45 mins and pop another a nice smooth roll.I think the large mg pills are just pointless they dodon&#039;t do anything exept raise the negative side effects. I do however like splitting the xtcexpress bombs in half they are nice.

				so basically all of the new pills being made in high dosages are just an easier way of taking in halves rather than buying a shitload to go thru in one night

				The white question marks felt great, but taking two of them made me puke.&nbsp; &nbsp;One followed by a half 40 minutes later, is probably a better way to roll.
