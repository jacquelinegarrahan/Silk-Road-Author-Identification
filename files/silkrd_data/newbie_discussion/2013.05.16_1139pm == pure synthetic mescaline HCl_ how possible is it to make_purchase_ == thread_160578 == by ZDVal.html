				What vendor? I know some do offer it and people say its it but unless you test it there is probably no way of knowing cuz vendors can change whenever they want.

				It would be pretty irresponsible to sell 2c-i as Mescaline, the dosages are completely different.

				Thanks everyone for replying. <br /><br />@Dinoscripter: vendor Mahakala ; yep I&#039;ve heard about irresponsible vendors, but Mahakala looks the real deal<br /><br />@Lazerz, yes that&#039;s my fear.<br /><br />Also cos I&#039;m reading that this stuff is (a) very rare (and lots of misbelief amongst folk that it exists synthetically); and (b) too expensive to manufacture to be worth selling.<br /><br />@hardcorekid; planning on taking it in next few days, will certainly feedback :-) I&#039;ve heard nothing but positive feedback about this one.<br /><br />Thanks again for replies, any further insights before I go for it would be welcome. Maybe I should start with 250mg or sthg.<br /><br />Z

				Well, if it is a 2c of some kind then 250mg would be a massive overdose. Maybe start with about 20mg and work up from there? <br /><br />I&#039;ve only had extracted Mescaline, never head of the synthetic floating around but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s out there.

				Thanks Lazerz, yep that would be sensible start in that case.<br /><br />Funny thing is, earlier on I found this thread via Google - it didn&#039;t come up in the search in SRF!<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=75557.0<br /><br />So maybe it is the real deal after all: problem is, I need 50 posts to go into that thread to ask for an update :-l (as what I have appears to be a new batch).<br /><br />Will keep posted. <br />

				I bought some mescaline from Gammagoblin a month ago, but haven&#039;t tried it yet. I will update this thread when I try it, hopefully soon!

				Every one says that about anything weird and unique.&nbsp; If it&#039;s from the Road it is most likely good.&nbsp; I actually got some at a music festival.&nbsp; It may just be an extraction, not synthetic.&nbsp; But again sellers on here are for the most part pretty honest.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be too worried.
