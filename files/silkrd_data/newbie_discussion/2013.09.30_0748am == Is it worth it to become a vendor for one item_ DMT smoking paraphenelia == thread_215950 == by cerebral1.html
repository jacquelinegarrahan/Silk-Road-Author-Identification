				As a user of DMT, I have often wondered what the perfect device is to ingest that substance. A number of vendors have confirmed as much when I asked the same question, there is a borosilicate vaporizer on the market that is currently considered the &quot;cadillac&quot; of DMT ingestion devices.<br /><br />I am considering getting a vendor account to advertise in the DMT section, and only sell this device.<br /><br />I have made an enquiry with the manufacturer of this device as to becoming a dealer. My current thought is I would take orders on the road for the normal retail price of the device, add shipping options per the manufacturer, and place orders to be drop shipped from the manufacturer. As I was typing that I realize there are security holes LEO could drive a truck through, so let me modify that to: I&#039;d start by purchasing the minimum order I can from this company and re-ship myself, full security measures in place PGP addresses and self destructing data at the time of label printing...<br /><br />As I have a day job, I&#039;m only considering this as a service to fellow DMT users, and perhaps to make enough BTC to buy a gram or two a month for myself. So I would not be doing this as a business, and frankly if the volume got too high, I don&#039;t think I could handle it.<br /><br />Does this seem like a reasonable thing to pursue? Should I instead be messaging other DMT vendors and working out a scheme to get this into their hands so you might see a combined listing for DMT + vaporizer and &quot;refill DMT&quot; listings.<br /><br />Just a thought, but I&#039;ve found sourcing this device locally to be problematic, and thought it would be frickin&#039; cool to order it on the road.<br /><br />Your comments, suggestions and advice all welcome.

				Hey mate,<br /><br />I personally think that unless there is a very high demand for this &quot;DMT vaporizer&quot; its not worth selling. maybe if u were selling other similar products or drugs then people who buy from you might b interested, but i really doubt anyone would buy it if that is all you sell and its not in high demand/cheap.<br /><br />hope this helps you <br /><br />Walt Disney<br />

				unless you think you can make over (i think) 30 sales on the vendor account i wouldn&#039;t bother mate. to become a vendor it&#039;s a $500 bond, returned on completion of 30 sales

				A glass vapor genie is a great tool - it would be a good listing here. But I wouldn&#039;t want my DMT to arrive with one, as that&#039;d be a bulky package.

				DMT is hot now, and your product would sell. You can list through other vendors if you don&#039;t want to drop the $500 nut, but honestly you&#039;d make that back in a month.

				Possibly. If you&#039;re talking about the same kind of pipe I am it can be used for other things as well. The problem is that there are plenty of people providing dmt pipes or doing it just to supplement their dmt income. If you can buy bulk and pay the vendor fee, though, it would be worth it anyway.

				You could always sell your vendor account if you can&#039;t get to 30.

				Yes, but I&#039;d recommend selling DMT also. It&#039;s not that hard, just buy a bit in bulk for a little while, and if you make enough on paraphernalia alone, then take down the listing. <br /><br />There&#039;s even a guy on a .onion link that can help you find real life dealers who can sell bulk to you. <br /><br />I only say the above because the DMT will for sure sell, and you can not only make profits if your other stuff doesn&#039;t sell right away, but it also gives you great leverage (more reviews, more people involved with you as a businessman/businesswoman)
