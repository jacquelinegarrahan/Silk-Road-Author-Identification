				Wish I were able to just obtain suboxone, not all that easy to come by in my area sadly. People would rather just stay on the dope.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard loperamide helps, is that mainly just for the shits or does it help with the achy / sweaty / cold / etc as well? &amp; when you say prepare to spend a lot on the pills, how much is a lot? Also, are they available in any grocery store or should I go to a pharmacy or something of the sort.<br /><br />Thanks for the help guys, really appreciate it.

				Do you have any Rx drugs available like benzodiazepines? <br /><br />In case you haven&#039;t heard of it before, I&#039;ve pasted the Thomas Recipe below. Even if you don&#039;t have any benzos, I think some of the advice might be helpful. I&#039;ve heard good things about the L-Tyrosine, which you can get at any health food or vitamin store. Nothing is going to completely get rid of your symptoms and nothing is going to work instantly but this stuff might help make it a bit more bearable. However, everyone reacts differently so keep in mind that your mileage may vary. Good luck and I hope you can get well soon.<br /><br /><br />&quot;PLEASE NOTE: I am not a doctor, simply a long-time Rx opiate junkie who has had many opportunities to develop a way to detox. This is a recipe for at-home self-detox from opiates based on my experience as well as that of many other addicts. It is not intended as professional medical advice. It is always wise to make sure none of the recipe ingredients or procedures conflict with medications you may be taking. Likewise, if you have any medical condition, disease, allergy or any other health issue, consult your doctor before using the recipe. Thanks, Thomas <br /><br />THOMAS RECIPE <br /><br />If you can&#039;t take time off to detox, I recommend you follow a taper regimen using your drug of choice or suitable alternate -- the slower the taper, the better. <br /><br />For the Recipe, You&#039;ll need: <br /><br />1. Valium (or another benzodiazepine such as Klonopin, Librium, Ativan or Xanax). Of these, Valium and Klonopin are best suited for tapering since they come in tablet form. Librium is also an excellent detox benzo, but comes in capsules, making it hard to taper the dose. Ativan or Xanax should only be used if you can&#039;t get one of the others. <br /><br />2. Imodium (over the counter, any drug or grocery store). <br /><br />3. L-Tyrosine (500 mg caps) from the health food store. <br /><br />4. Strong wide-spectrum mineral supplement with at least 100% RDA of Zinc, Phosphorus, Copper, Magnesium and Potassium (you may not find the potassium in the same supplement). <br /><br />5. Vitamin B6 caps. <br /><br />6. Access to hot baths or a Jacuzzi (or hot showers if that&#039;s all that&#039;s available). <br /><br />How to use the recipe: <br /><br />Start the vitamin/mineral supplement right away (or the first day you can keep it down), preferably with food. Potassium early in the detox is important to help relieve RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome). Bananas are a good source of potassium if you can&#039;t find a supplement for it. <br /><br />Begin your detox with regular doses of Valium (or alternate benzo). Start with a dose high enough to produce sleep. Before you use any benzo, make sure you&#039;re aware of how often it can be safely taken. Different benzos have different dosing schedules. Taper your Valium dosage down after each day. The goal is to get through day 4, after which the worst WD symptoms will subside. You shouldn&#039;t need the Valium after day 4 or 5. <br /><br />During detox, hit the hot bath or Jacuzzi as often as you need to for muscle aches. Don&#039;t underestimate the effectiveness of hot soaks. Spend the entire time, if necessary, in a hot bath. This simple method will alleviate what is for many the worst opiate WD symptom. <br /><br />Use the Imodium aggressively to stop the runs. Take as much as you need, as often as you need it. Don&#039;t take it, however, if you don&#039;t need it. <br /><br />At the end of the fourth day, you should be waking up from the Valium and experiencing the beginnings of the opiate WD malaise. Upon rising (empty stomach), take the L-Tyrosine. Try 2000 mgs, and scale up or down, depending on how you feel. You can take up to 4,000 mgs. Take the L-Tyrosine with B6 to help absorption. Wait about one hour before eating breakfast. The L-Tyrosine will give you a surge of physical and mental energy that will help counteract the malaise. You may continue to take it each morning for as long as it helps. If you find it gives you the &quot;coffee jitters,&quot; consider lowering the dosage or discontinuing it altogether. Occasionally, L-Tyrosine can cause the runs. Unlike the runs from opiate WD, however, this effect of L-Tyrosine is mild and normally does not return after the first hour. Lowering the dosage may help. <br /><br />Continue to take the vitamin/mineral supplement with breakfast. <br /><br />As soon as you can force yourself to, get some mild exercise such as walking, cycling, swimming, etc. This will be hard at first, but will make you feel considerably better. <br /><br />Thomas&quot;

				Immodium is available at walmart, grocery stores etc..the store brand will save you a bit of $<br />Benzos help immensely. Weed of course works also..<br />Clonidine, a blood pressure medication, if you can find anyone has some, but it makes you sleepy and I personally hate it.<br />Immdoium is easiest and you can take a ton of it, it wont hurt anyway.

				High doses of cbd won&#039;t cause the effects of thc,but will relieve alot&nbsp; of the symptoms.Try a local dispensay.For the dxm best to try to get the pure powder then&nbsp; put it into capsules of doses of 150-350mg or until the withdrawals are gone.Im telling you this works.Wish you the best.

				You guys are awesome, just sent the girlfriend off with a list to the health food store / pharmacy. I can&#039;t stress enough how much I appreciate all the help. <br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely have to look into dxm, not sure about dosing it before work, guess I&#039;d just have to be careful with the dosage. (Robotripping at work while dopesick doesn&#039;t sound like very much fun lol)<br /><br />Sadly I don&#039;t live in an area where medical marijuana is available, so that basically kills the availability of edibles. I actually have a nice indica dominant strain on hand, not enough to be able to make a respectable batch of butter for edibles, but would simply smoking the flower help alleviate some of the symptoms? (Going to give it a whirl anyways ;) )<br /><br />Ah, didn&#039;t think of getting the suboxone from SR, that&#039;s definitely an awesome idea as well.<br /><br />Again, I really really appreciate all the help everyone. Feelin the love. :) <br />

				Look if you have any local Smoke Shops.<br /><br />They most of the time will have some Kratom Extract. <br /><br />At mine they have Kratom Extract Pills 3 for $15. Take 1 and its like a 5mg oxycodone, and take 2 and its like a 10mg.<br /><br />That can help and I have heard people used it to get off.

				Yeah just make sure you take a decent amount of the Loperamide. For mild-moderate withdrawals I take about 10 pills (20mg). I&#039;d also take a stool softener (just 1 pill) so your shits not all fucked up. It can take a couple hours to start working, so don&#039;t bug out if it doesn&#039;t help right away.

				I&#039;d recommend Ibogaine. There has been a lot of research on using it to treat addiction and help alleviate withdrawal symptoms in people addicted to opiates, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine ..etc and can stop withdrawals dead in their tracks by just using it once.&nbsp; You should just know what you are getting into beforehand, which is a very powerful internal hallucinogenic experience that can be very difficult at the time, but you will be thankful you went through it after you finish. It can actually help curb cravings afterwards too. <br /><br />Its a rather interesting substance and there is a lot of great information on clearnet about it.

				Thanks again for all the help guys, was able to source just about everything mentioned in this thread relatively easily (except for benzos, was able to pick up some Tramadol / Flexoril that I feel helps quite a bit, though).<br /><br />I can honestly say I feel ~85% better going on day 3 of not using. The desire to do a little bit &amp; hopefully just keep chipping every week - 2 weeks is there, but I really never want to feel like that again. Day 1 w/d&#039;s with nothing ready to combat the symptoms has got to be one of the worst feelings you&#039;ll ever experience (if you have the misfortune to experience them) in your lifetime.<br /><br />Think the plan is to stay off the shit for at least 2 weeks &amp; possibly use a small small amount around the 7th of next month (my girl and I&#039;s 1 year anniversary) :)<br /><br />Love you guys, you definitely made this experience a lot less grim than it was looking to be.

Take 1 and its like a 5mg oxycodone, and take 2 and its like a 10mg.<br /><br />That can help and I have heard people used it to get off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Kratom is something I can swear by personally. It worked great! If you can get some Tramadol that will help, also something I have used. Other than that there is nothing I know of that helps. Good luck brother!! I hope you get right soon!
