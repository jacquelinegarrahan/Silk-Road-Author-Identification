				Rival Vendor Impersonating me! I am UnlimitedLife and he is spamming the forums with my SR vendor name! I am getting spammed with messages after messages on my SR vendor account from people that want there free gifts that I am apparently offering on the forums under the user name UnlimitedLife.. this is just ridiculous. I can prove I am the REAL UnlimitedLife on SR,BMR,ATL, and many other networks! We can verify it is us by our PGP key as well as sending admins messages from our SR VENDOR acct. Any information needed to remove this joker from spamming and impersonating me on these forums would be of great assistance!<br /><br />We are 100% good business and offer HIGH QUALITY products &amp; GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! I ASK A MOD OR ADMIN PLEASE CONTACT ME AND HELP ME RECOVER MY USER NAME ON THESE FORUMS SO THIS IMPOSTER CAN STOP TRYING TO HARASS CUSTOMERS AND START PROBLEMS ON THE FORUMS AND SR FOR THAT MATTER!<br /><br />YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE HERE HIM CAUSING PROBLEMS: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187568<br /><br />Luckily for me I have loyal customers who messaged me on SR and informed me of this imposter acting like me and causing problems!<br /><br />Feel free to message me for verification on my SR VENDOR page: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/silkroad/user/aa97d4fac3<br /><br />Thanks for all the people who can tell the difference between a REAL PROFESSIONAL VENDOR and an imposter scam artist loser who obviously has too much time on his hands to be playing childish games on the internet!<br /><br />Thanks for your time hope we can get this cleared up immediately.<br /><br />-UnlimitedLife

				Beware.<br /><br />Regardless of the behavior of the shitweasel impersonating this vendor on the forums, his SR account itself is the subject of some suspicion regarding skeezy behavior.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187068.0

				I appreciate all of my loyal customers who messaged me letting me know what this imposter was doing on here! I had no idea about the forums and did not know that anyone could sign up as my username on here.. I figured creating an account on SR would do so on here as well. Please somebody remove all the threads and delete the account that the imposter is using! <br /><br />again anyone who is doubting my products or thinking I am shady.. why dont you look at the customers who have purchased from me.. I believe it is hard to feedback pad when more than half of my customers have spent over $5-10k.. but yea to all you people who actually believe I am sketchy or anything of the sort you must not be very knowledgeable coming up with your conspiracy theories of me to get customers money. I am indeed 100% LEGIT. Just because I have access to QUALITY product at a very AFFORDABLE rate does not mean I am sketchy or that I am a scammer for that matter! I have good connections and good product to offer and just because all these hater vendors are mad that my product is BETTER and my prices are AFFORDABLE, doesnt make me a bad guy! I am here for good business!<br /><br />&nbsp;I take care of my customers! I will in fact post an ad on the forums and ask all my past customers who have a forum account to post there positive feedback about me so EVERYONE can see I am VERY LEGIT AND OFFER VERY QUALITY PRODUCT AT AFFORDABLE RATES! THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND HOPE WE CAN GET THIS IMPOSTER DELETED AND THE ACCOUNT HANDED OVER TO THE REAL OWNER! ME! THANK YOU!<br /><br />-UnlimitedLife<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/silkroad/user/aa97d4fac3

				After looking at your account, it needs to be checked out by the admin.&nbsp; Other than that, as I stated, we cannot delete the posts and account for you.&nbsp; No one &quot;owns&quot; the names they use here.

				Thank you! Anything to get this idiot from stop harassing me! He is obviously a rival vendor upset that I am offering higher quality product at a cheaper price than him! For all these idiots who actually think I am sketchy because of this douche really need to grow up! I have connections! I buy bulk wholesale and am able to sell quality at cheaper than other.. Doesnt mean I am scam or sketchy! I am going to post an ad on the forums and ask all my LOYAL CUSTOMERS to inform everyone by posting of my quality product service! We are here for good business! Anything else please message me via my SR account or by emailing my PGP email! Thanks friends and hope you all are smart enough to decipher a REAL professional and this imposter acting like a child!<br /><br />I appreciate all of my loyal customers who messaged me letting me know what this imposter was doing on here!
