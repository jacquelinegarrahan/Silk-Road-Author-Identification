				I think The controlled delivery is often just a means of seeing if the recipient is home.&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, warrants require the person to be identified before the door goes down .&nbsp; &nbsp;Warrant is in hand already or soon to come , based on the package smell alone.&#039; Hell, mother just pretend to smell pot and they got the warrant.&nbsp; It&#039;s that easy for them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I got my car searched with a warrant because the passenger had a record and looked nervous.&#039;&nbsp; I hate the fuzz.

				I got a controlled delivery. Fucking idiots at customs held my package for about 3 weeks then tried to deliver it. So it was obvious. I just made sure I was gone all day when it was supposed to be delivered. When I get the the spot there was a note on the door that said,&quot; Please call this number to pick up your package.&quot; Lol. God LE is stupid.<br /><br />If I had picked it up I would probably be doing 20 years. So just know your shit.

You&#039;re not gonna get arrested on the spot when they do a controlled deliver unless they have a ton of evidence on you already, at that point you&#039;re already screwed.<br /><br />Think about it this way. What if you sent a package to a hated enemy. They do a controlled delivery on him, he signs and takes the package. Does he end up in jail because he signed for some random package? Highly unlikely they could convince a judge to convict you based on that alone. Now if they get a warrant after he signs and search his found and find more illegal stuff it&#039;s a different story.<br /><br />Go with your gut. Keep your senses up. Don&#039;t let them rush you or push you into doing something. If something happens shut up and ask for an attorney. Chances are you&#039;ll get out of it one way or another.

				Not signing isn&#039;t necessarily going to save your ass, but law enforcement prefers to have you sign for a package. It makes their case that much stronger.

A couple of years ago my neighbor (psycho old lady) called the police on me because she thought I had too much traffic in and out of my house. Thought it was a crack house I guess even though it&#039;s in a 700k a house average neighborhood. So cops arrive and after I answer the door they push their way in saying they smelled cannabis. The cops proceeded to look around my house looking in every corner but not opening drawers or anything. My house was clean and they then told me the neighbor called and they have to check up on every call like this they get.&nbsp; See no search warrant needed after the door is open.

Which is why you should never sign for a package, not only are sellers not supposed to require it, but by signing you are accepting ownership of the package.

				Honestly I don&#039;t know the legal ramifications but I do know that when they knocked at the drop house and nobody answered the door he just stood there and kept knowing and wringing the doorbell. Finally they said fuck it and put a note on the door with the ASK-USPS number blacked out and it said please call some local number instead. Lol. I&#039;m not a fucking fool. So I later that night I went and got the note, took if off of the door and said peace out! Noway if fuck was I gonna answer that note, dumbass LE. So I went on my merry way and nothing ever happened. They never called,&nbsp; followed me or a damn thing. This was a Kilo of a schedule 4 narcotic so it wasn&#039;t ice cream. But screw it. They couldn&#039;t prove I ordered a damn thing and so they couldn&#039;t do shit. That;s the key. Don&#039;t be or act suspicious and stay the hell away from that package!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />
