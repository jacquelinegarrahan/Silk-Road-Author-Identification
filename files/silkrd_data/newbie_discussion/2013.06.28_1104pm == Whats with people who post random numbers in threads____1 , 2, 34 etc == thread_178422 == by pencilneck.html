				Whats with people who post random numbers in threads????1 , 2, 34 etc. Is there some sort of point to it i have missed? Is it LE perhaps numbering the threads they want to keep heading back to? I mean i was writing in a thread and then all of a sudden some idiot chimes in and all they have to add to the conversation is &quot;34&quot;. WTF 34 what?<br />Then you go into their posts to find that they are up to about number 50 and have done it in lots of threads so i am just wondering why? Anyone have any thoughts? Thankyou

				You have to get to 50 posts to be able to post in any other forum outside of Newbie.&nbsp; Probably it&#039;s just a count to get 50.

				3̶1̶<br />Just kidding. But seriously, why would LE type in the threads to categorize? I&#039;m sure they just archive the forums on some database, if they even survey these threads to that degree.<br />[/font][/size]

				oh ok i see. pretty ridiculous IMO but i guess there&#039;s also a reason why there is that 50 post rule here for a noob like me.<br />So everyone knows then when they see a number 9 at my next post below they will know why i did it and that i have not just taken some acid &amp; been watching the count on sesame street or anything LOL. <br />Thanks for the replies that answered things.
