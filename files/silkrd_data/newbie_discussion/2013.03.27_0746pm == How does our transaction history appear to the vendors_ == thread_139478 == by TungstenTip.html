				Any of your buyer stats are only visible to sellers who you have a pending order with. On the main page that displays all current orders there&#039;s a &quot;stats&quot; category next to each buyer&#039;s username that has the number of transactions the buyer has completed on SR &amp; the buyer&#039;s total refund rate (lord knows how the refund rate is calculated, but if you&#039;ve never had a seller issue you a partial or full refund for a package you never received, your refund rate will show up as 0%). Those two numbers are displayed as a link that leads the seller to a page with a few additional pieces of information about each buyer: the total amount of USD they&#039;ve spent on past transactions, how many transactions of yours have been auto-finalized, &amp; how long you&#039;ve been a member on SR for.
