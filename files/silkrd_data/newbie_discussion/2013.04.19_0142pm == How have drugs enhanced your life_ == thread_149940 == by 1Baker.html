				I&#039;m a softie and have only dabbled in weed and shrooms, but I feel like the drug induced euphoria and creative insights I get from these things has made my life better.&nbsp; I&#039;m off weed because of drug testing and shroom use has filled their place.&nbsp; Shrooms have a necessary tolerance break of about a week so it means I can&#039;t overdo it.&nbsp; It just means I have a weekly trip into happy land and I take a dose that I can function well on.&nbsp; Life is great thanks to the road! <br /><br />DMT is soon to be my next adventure.&nbsp; :D:D:D

				Most my experience is with weed(24/7), psychedelics and coke! I feel drugs have made me very open minded and exposed me to experiences that others will never experience. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had my bad times on drugs but mainly when i was young and didn&#039;t know when enough was enough. Now i use moderately at weekends and the main things is.... their so much fun!!!!

				Very good Question, <br /><br />I find it hard to publicly speak :-[. I have to do 3 - 4 big speeches a year and I find that its a rather nerve racking experience. With the calamity of every day life and the hustle and bustle of the busy streets. I find that a LITTLE needle goes a LONG way to ease the strain for both everyday and the big speech days.<br /><br />I never found any such cases where I was unable to do the public speaking without completion... I mean I always got it done with a moderate amount of strain and stress - but I&#039;m thinking... who in the hell wants stress? Doctors recommend not to get involved with hard drugs, but I say why do all the worrying?Just a little needle wont hurt! So I plucked up the courage and bought a shit load of heroin for my big speech days (and once a month recreational use with old friends, recently more often than that mind).<br /><br />Now all is well, I am able to do my public speaking and I last a whole lot longer with the very carefully administrated heroin (about 50mg via IV) before I go on stage. All my worries and stress ease away and sometimes I can even nod off a little bit during the speech! I will continue to use this wonderful drug as I find it helps ease the strains of every day life and doing big speeches and anything involving any kind of mental though process under pressure. <br /><br />I have my driving test coming up in a couple of weeks so my mates decided to go ahead and treat me to a 80 bag of heroin off NOD. I&#039;ll do the whole bag from early in the morning up until midday, and the test should be a doddle.<br /><br />My dog seems to like it too, a little needle for wee barky the dog and hes straight to sleep. (better than taking him for a walk when its raining).<br /><br />So Heroin is my medicine of choice.<br /><br />Disco

				Adderall has made me productive, when I decide to take it. An antidepressant has helped with some issues, and keeps me balanced and not extremely moody. <br /><br />Alcohol hasn&#039;t done anything good or bad; I haven&#039;t done anything stupid while drunk (besides the usual acting like a drunk person at college parties, but thats par of the course in a college environment). It lends itself to a good time though, but I dont NEED it to have a good time.<br /><br />Psychedelics are fun, and somewhat thought inspiring. But not the end all to &#039;enlightenment&#039;.

				I once said on shrooms &quot;why does anybody take drugs? we don&#039;t need drugs, I don&#039;t need drugs&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve found meditation to be the most rewarding to be honest, but drugs are still fun and can be beneficial - and certainly an interesting way to make money.

				Done many drugs in my days, from the lowest and grossest to the psychonaut spaceship drugs, but the only drugs I can honestly say benefited me in any true way were probably mushrooms and mdma. Mushrooms gave me a great first trip and a few difficult experiences, but in the difficult experiences I feel as though it showed me what I found ugly about myself and I still think about it each and every day. Haven&#039;t done them in a few years though, I don&#039;t know if I will ever need or want to do them again. LSD kinda did the same thing, but was nowhere near as profound. MDMA just helped me meet people and experience things I wouldn&#039;t have had I never done the drug, like music festivals and adventurous nights, etc, but MDMA was more on a complete ego awareness whereas mushrooms were a complete dissolution of ego and humbled the fuck out of me. Every other drug I have done has just been fun and not really enhanced my life in any way, shape, or form.

				LSD has been the most beneficial for me.<br /><br />Acid showed me that there was some kind of existence beyond what my five senses could perceive. It helped me to see that physical reality and day-to-day life was just the tip of the iceberg..... spurred me on to start studying metaphysics and philosophy. It&#039;s not often I trip anymore, but when I do, I get that feeling of being &quot;Home&quot;.<br />

				It&#039;s hard to pinpoint what, exactly, I learned from LSD, but I reminisce about my experiences with it often as a source of happiness when I&#039;m feeling down. My taste in music was significantly changed by it and I feel that I enjoy music much more now. I was reading a bunch of books about consciousness (Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter in particular) during the time I experimented with acid, and spent much of my trips pondering this subject, so I speculate that many of my realizations and opinions on the subject were aided by the cognitive effects of tripping. From a moral standpoint, I feel that acid lead me to be a nihilist humanist, in that I view the world as having no intrinsic value, but the subjective goals of humanity are still important to me simply because I am stuck being a human. <br /><br />Also, &quot;ego death&quot; experiences helped solidify my views on the self as a product of the mind, because I was able to have an experience without the self, if that makes any sense. In other words, I reached a point where I felt dissociated from my identity and thought only in terms of third person. Rather than thinking &quot;I am picking up this apple,&quot; I would think &quot;This collection of cells is extending an appendage...&quot; There was no more &quot;I&quot; in my experience. I also saw the boundary between my body and the rest of the universe as arbitrary, and therefore thought that there is only a sea of particles, of which we view in arbitrary &quot;chunks&quot; to make it easier to understand. This would be similar to the common sentiment people have on psychedelics involving &quot;I&#039;m one with everything&quot; type thoughts. If you have never had an ego death experience, I recommend working your way up to 300-400 uq LSD while pondering philosophy of mind and analyzing your own thought process.

				I used to be severely depressed and on anti-depressants (SSRIs) for years. Eventually I came off them and the doctors considered me no longer depressed - I wasn&#039;t trying to kill myself any more anyway. But I was still kind of morose, pessimistic and not enjoying life. I didn&#039;t realise it at the time, because I hadn&#039;t known anything else for so long.<br /><br />Then one day someone gave me MDMA. It was the best night of my entire life. I was so glad I hadn&#039;t committed suicide. I felt like everyone should experience this. It was literally eye opening and changed my outlook. Afterwards I just became happier since then. I have a much more positive outlook and look forward to the future, and am less cynical of people.<br /><br />I should also point out that I have social anxiety disorder and am very shy. Now whilst the effects of MDMA are not permanent, it&#039;s like being shown what it can be like. In the depressed, anxious state I was before, it was impossible for me to change. I never knew anything else. After MDMA I keep some of the feeling with me for a few weeks after a roll: I&#039;m more open to new things and meeting people, I&#039;m more sociable, I can enjoy talking to people. Over time these effects become more permanent, probably because it&#039;s like practising. But the biggest thing was just having my eyes opened to something I was blind of and seeing the world in a different way. PLUR.<br /><br />I can completely understand how it was originally used in psychology to help patients open up and to help them come to terms with things. It&#039;s such a shame that the war on drugs is so myopic and motivated by voter ignorance rather than science. Things like LSD and MDMA can genuinely help people. It&#039;s certainly changed my life for the better and therapeutic uses should be researched.<br /><br />
