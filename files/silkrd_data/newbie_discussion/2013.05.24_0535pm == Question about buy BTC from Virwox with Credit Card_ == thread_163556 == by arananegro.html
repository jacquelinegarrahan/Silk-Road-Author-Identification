				Does anyone have experience buying bitcoins from Virwox with a credit card?&nbsp; I know that they put a 48hr hold on the funds before you can exchange into bitcoin and transfer.<br />But are there any other transactions limits?&nbsp; Is there a limit on the amount that you can pay with a credit card per day?<br />Or a limit on how many transactions per day you can do?<br />

				For withdraws from virwox to your paypal or credit card I don&#039;t think they are limits.<br /><br />For deposits into virwox with a cc it depends on your account level.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you login and click deposit and scroll down it will tell you how much you can deposit daily/monthly.&nbsp; In that same area you can check the different account levels and their limits, they make it really easy to find.

				Last time I checked Virwox, you needed to change USD into Lindon (second life) dollars first, then into BTC.<br />The effective rate you pay at the end is far higher than other places, not the best way to do it if you ask me.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ve got cheaper BTC using cash.

				If you place a limit order and wait when converting lindens to btc you can get a much better rate than a market order.&nbsp; <br /><br />Virwox is about as expensive as bitinstant when you do limit orders and have an older account with a high discount percentage.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now if you think about the time, gas, and annoyance of moneygram, virwox is a little cheaper.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although virwox does sometimes have a manual step delay in processing btc withdraws so that sucks sometimes.&nbsp; Pro and cons my friends, pros and cons.

				Yeah I checked into it, you really need to have an older account there so the limits are raised for it to be worth using, the limits on new accounts are a joke less than 100$ a day
