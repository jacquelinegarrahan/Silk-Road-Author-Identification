				&quot;Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God. &quot;The argument goes something like this: `I refuse to prove that I exist,&#039; says God, `for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.&#039; &quot;`But,&#039; says Man, `The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn&#039;t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don&#039;t. QED.&#039;

				BOOK ...Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much... the wheel, New York, wars, and so on, whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.
