				I was looking into using bitfloor recently because I heard their fees are pretty low... I&#039;m pretty sure bitcopia&#039;s fees are getting higher so I was looking for a new exchange. I liked bitcopia because you could use it through tor and was the most anonymous exchange I could find, but the fees were high. I don&#039;t really like buying btc on clearnet, so does anyone know if it&#039;s safe to use bitfloor this way?

				I&#039;ve only used bitfloor and I&#039;ve always used it through tor. I&#039;m super pleased with it too. Extremely low fees and your money is in your account within half an hour (at least it&#039;s always been that way for me). Only need an email to register and whenever I&#039;ve gone to Bank of America to make the cash deposit, I&#039;ve never been asked for an ID.<br /><br />I highly recommend bitfloor if there&#039;s a BoA near you

				You&#039;re fine using the clearnet. BTC are not illegal in any way.

				This is straight from their website:<br /><br />Tor<br /><br />We allow the use of Tor to access and use Bitfloor. However, if you wish to withdraw government currencies you may be required to provide certain forms of identification. If you ever have questions about identification requirements, contact us before depositing funds.
