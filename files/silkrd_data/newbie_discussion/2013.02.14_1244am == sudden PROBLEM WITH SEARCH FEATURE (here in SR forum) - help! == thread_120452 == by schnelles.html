				hi,<br /><br />i have used the search feature quite some times with good results.,<br />now since today it doesnt work anymore !<br /><br />whatever i try, when i click search i get an ERROR page saying <br />&quot;error - your last search is less than 5 seconds ago&quot;&nbsp; (or a very similar statement).<br /><br />the point is : this is NOT TRUE !<br /><br /><br />i even get this error on my very first search, right after log in.<br />or i wait a minute, no matter - same error every time no matter what i do.<br /><br />this must be a site problem i guess.<br />does search work for you ?<br /><br />am i doing something wrong maybe ?<br />i also tried advanced search, always same error.<br /><br />earlier it worked flawlessly, since today i cannot search anymore<br /><br />who knows more ?<br />

				This has been an issue for a while and i dont know if a fix is in the works or not.<br /><br />We are all using a tor hidden service, so no tor exit node is used.&nbsp; The problem is that to the server (i think) it looks like we are all using the same IP address.&nbsp; This is why you see the 5 second error, and why it gets worse as the site gets busier.&nbsp; <br /><br />Im not sure my explanation is 100% technically correct, anyone with more info free free to correct me.

I do not know how probable that is though, or if it even makes technical sense. Most of the documentation on the network goes way over my head.
