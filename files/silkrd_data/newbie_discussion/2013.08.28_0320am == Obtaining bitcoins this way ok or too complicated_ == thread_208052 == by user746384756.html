				been using VirWox to exchange my currency through a few steps (paypal) and then eventually into bitcoins but there is a limit on how much you can deposit per day then a cap for each month which is very low and annoying. The system does work and uses paypal as a safety net in case anything goes wrong but there has to be a better way. and the whole localbitcoin idea seems sketch because you are pretty much handing your money over first to someone that could easily not deposit btc in your account. So many ways to do this but so many pitfalls as well, anyone have any legit experience with other ways that have worked over and over again without such a small cap/limit by daily/monthly basis?<br /><br />(also researched other posts and reviews about btc vendors but get overwhelmed by mixed reviews and would just like some actual input from other users which is greatly appreciated)<br /><br />(also received my first order today after being paranoid and anxious as well, so if you have yet to receive whatever you want for the first time then no worries because it is legit, just check up on vendor reviews and ratings)

				Virwox uses levels from 1 to 4 depending on how much you have traded.<br /><br />When you reach level 3, you can ask them to become a level 4 and then it&#039;s almost limitless.<br /><br />Sometimes you get lucky on virwox and sell USD high and buy btc cheap, if you wait a little bit.<br /><br />Otherwise fees would be quite high

				see that&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about, I&#039;ve been using them and they&#039;re legit, don&#039;t care about their fee b/c everygone has to get paid a lil bit, but hopefully it will not take too much time to get limitless. Also, I&#039;m hearing good word on bitinstant, also waiting for it to come online to scope their offerings out.<br /><br />I appreciate the time taken to read/reply to my post from everyone.

				IMHO the best way is to use WU or MG to bitcoins conversion services! Best of all there are lot of vendors that charge 0% service fee

				I just started to try out bitstamp today<br /><br />But that is mostly for selling. I heard mtgox has some annoying payout issues.<br /><br />Otherwise i have used virwox alot. Doing a little speculation and waited long enough i was able to get my bitcoins once at a lower price than listed on mtgox. But that was only a one time thing :-/

				Obtaining bitcoins is a bitch. Well, not really, but i cant help but compare it to everything else on the internet. If i cant have it in five minutes thats too damn long and verification is a bitch. However, taking a little time to do homework and figure it all out is pretty damn enjoyable and exciting i think. I would also argue that understanding them and how to safely use them is a valuable skill, and i think the simple act of using TOR as well as procuring a freakin INSANE currency (crazy in a good way) puts you automatically in the not-a-dipshit crowd (technologically and common sense speaking). <br /><br />What i just said was stupid, you say? Go ask the next guy walking down the street what Tor or a bitcoin is, That&#039;s all im saying. <br /><br />I should also point out that apparently i need 50 posts so that&#039;s why my reply BARELY approaches your topic. Sometimes i like to express my opinions on discussion boards after i smoke pot because its entertaining.<br /><br />I also wanna say thanks to these forums, finally a reliable place to ask my millions of stupid internet questions, that bitcoin info may have seemed simple but i needed it (they make apps on phones for that now?) i didnt know what a hard drive was a year go, today i use Ubuntu on a broken laptop i fixed, trust me ive had some dumb questions, but im almost an official nerd now.

				In my previous post i can see there was a typo spelling virwix. It should say Virwox. The reason i&#039;m writing this is that Virwix is a known scammer site, that rips those off who spells the sitename incorrectly in their browser :-)<br /><br />Just something to remember!

				Personally, once I used it a few times and got past some of the fees, limits and waiting I don&#039;t think virwox is such a bad service. Sure, it may cost a little bit more but it&#039;s my only option.<br />~D

				Interesting this Virwox - will need to check it out. In the meantime, I sell btc for cash deposits typically. I have accounts in most major banks for convenience. Or, if in close proximity, I&#039;ll be happy to meet and make the entire exchange in person. After bitcoin, cash is usually the easiest way to buy (unless you live in the boonies where nothing&#039;s around and you need to do online purchase). <br />Right now, I&#039;m offering at 5%!! Get them while this offer is hot, no strings attached - I&#039;m just trying to build my rep as a solid provider on here. You get a good rate and I build a strong rep. Hit me up via libertycoin@safe-mail.net

				localbitcoins.com has escrow protection. When you open a buy with the seller the dollar amount in BTC is removed from the seller&#039;s account and placed in escrow. When the seller verifies payment, he releases the coin from escrow and it goes into the buyers wallet. No fuss no muss.

				For anyone wondering I have used Virwox many times in the past, and it is perfectly legit. However, the reason why it is somewhat awkward is because of the initial limits and the high fees that they charge. Now my limits have been pretty much removed, I am able to buy bitcoins in bulk with less fees, it just takes a few times to use the service to it&#039;s full.<br />~D
