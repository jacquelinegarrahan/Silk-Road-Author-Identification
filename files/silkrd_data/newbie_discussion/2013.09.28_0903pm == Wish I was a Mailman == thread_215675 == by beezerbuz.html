				I was just thinking the other day,&nbsp; what a perfect cover.&nbsp; I mean you have hundreds of random addresses to choose delivery to on your route. If the package is intercepted, LE would just bypass the regular mail man so he would be in the clear (they would either just confiscate it or try a CD on an innocent civilian), the recipient knows nothing about the orders so there are no worries there, it would be extremely difficult to ever be caught from the angles I am looking at.&nbsp; It would be a bulk delivery wet dream.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hell its such a clean cover I may have to schmooze up to my mail guy, we all could make money.<br /><br />I bet there are tons of mailmen that are customers on SR.&nbsp; Good for them

				This would work. It is the mailman&#039;s job to deliver these things, there is no way he could be held accountable.<br /><br />You would be smart to stick to 2 addresses only so that they don&#039;t realize your route is getting lots of drug packages to random addresses. If a package ever fails to show then stop using that house and a few weeks later choose another second house.<br /><br />That way if one address is burnt you still have another active one. If you are on foot you may want a car or something along your route to drop it off at, and of course remove the address/postage as it might look like you are stealing mail.<br /><br />The only downside I can think of is that if you are caught they will want to make an example out of you.
