				Has anyone talked to RxKing today? Placed my first order with him last night and he guarantees shipping if ordered before 1pm. I haven&#039;t gotten a in transit status though and getting no responses back (he states between 12-8 he responds within 15 minutes, waited over an hour and nothing). Even more concerning is he now has no listings. What the heck is going on?!

				Yea, that&#039;s what I mean. I messaged him between his business hours (12-8) and it&#039;s been over an hour and a half now and I haven&#039;t received any response, it&#039;s now after his business hours and nothing. Very worried since he doesn&#039;t seem like the type to forget to mark in transit.

				He&#039;s definitely not a scammer, so hopefully there is a good reason.

				Oh no I totally don&#039;t think he&#039;s a scammer. Done my research and I know he&#039;s well recommended in these parts. That&#039;s why I&#039;m so worried actually. It did show he came on today so I&#039;m hoping he managed to see the orders and just never made it back online. It seems weird that he wouldn&#039;t be on but real life shit could have come up. Was just curious if anyone had talked to him.

				Guess I&#039;ll just have to wait and find out tomorrow when the product comes or doesn&#039;t. I chose him specifically due to his shipping options and guaranteed shipping times so would be extremely disappointed if he didn&#039;t get the order out today :(.
