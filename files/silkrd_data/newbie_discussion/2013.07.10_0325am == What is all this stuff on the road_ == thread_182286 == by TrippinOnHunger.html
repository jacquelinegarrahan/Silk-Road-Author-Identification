				Long story short, 4-AcO-DMT is basically a synthetic form of shrooms. Unless the law has changed recently, it&#039;s still technically legal in the US, but could potentially be prosecuted under the Analogue Act if they can prove that it&#039;s being used for human consumption. I&#039;m currently sitting on a few hundred mgs of it myself. Highly recommended. :)

				I think a lot of those are research chemicals. My guess is that they work.

				Only one i have plenty of experience with is 4acodmt is highly recommended. You may experience very slight stomach discomfort.&nbsp; The high is similar to shrooms, but noticeably different, i find shrooms much stronger and deeper overall.&nbsp; 4aco dmt is very visual and fun, no paranoia some may experience with shrooms.

				Research chemicals.&nbsp; I have a lot of those in stock.&nbsp; I carry 60 some various research chemicals of the highest quality but I only bother to list a few on Silk Road.&nbsp; Google and bluelight.ru work great.&nbsp; Erowid has fake trip reports and awful dosages but good pictures and pretty up to date sections on laws.

				Thanks everyone and thank you Jack N Hoff.&nbsp; I guess part of me is being lazy in taking the time to actually research all these intriguing drugs.&nbsp; The other part of me would rather get first hand experience from people that i believe are telling me the truth in these forums.&nbsp; I guess I just crave the interaction, its part of my addiction of love of drugs.&nbsp; Im lucky i dont have an addictive personality, I just really love drugs they are amazing when used wisely and I really wish others could see them the way I do which is why i try to spread em as much as possible! (without being a dumbass about it cuz i cant go to jail, i wont survive there Im such a wuss lol)
