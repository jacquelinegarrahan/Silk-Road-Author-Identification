				A friend of mine has a farm so we all got some acid and went out there. Such a great day, a bunch of us all high as balls, talking shit, all experiencing such an eyeopening thing together.<br /><br />Highlights include discovering a birds nest, playing with magnets and listening to music. Such an awesome day.

				Doing ayahuasca one night. Smoked DMT before but this was the first time with the juice. Previously while smoking I would get the image of an alien reaching out but I never had the guts to grab on. Well the night of the ayahuasca I did reach out to shake the hand and went on a wonderful journey. Ended up crying tears of joy from what I was shown and who I met. Definitely the most spiritual trip I had ever been on.<br />Peace&nbsp;

				First time doing acid my friends ended up ditching me so I did it alone but it turned out great, had nice mild OEV&#039;s and good CEV&#039;s. I found a lot of happiness during that trip and it taught me the beauty of being alone believe it or not. I ended up walking to my complex lake all by myself and smoked a nice fat blunt when I was coming down. It was an awesome experience.

Just do 1 stamp don&#039;t over do it your first time :) if you are really paranoid about it you DEFF want to have friends with you just incase and make sure they don&#039;t ditch you like mines did haha.

				My very first MDMA trip was pretty nice. I was out in a warm summers night and a friend persuaded me to try it with him. The trip was insanely intense and covered a lot of activities. We went into a club and after it I walked home, alone, and enjoyed the cold summernight breeze. I walked through a field with wheat on it and opened my jacket to get more of that breeze. It was one of my happiest moments I can remember.

				One of the best (not so much socially) was whilst on a heavy Ketamine session.&nbsp; Had the most comfy reclining leather sofa....watching Daft Punk &#039;Interstellar 5555&#039; on TV.... from being full reclined, went to an almost out of body experience where I was flying through the video, feeling completely weightless.&nbsp; Different colours drawing warmth and cold....<br /><br />Stuff like that is difficult to convey in words but WOW.

				Probably the first time I ever used MDMA. I was at a rave and I took a red star one of my friends had gotten from Atlanta. <br /><br />This shit must have been good, because I&#039;ve rolled several times after that and never rolled this hard again.<br />Basically, I made so many new friends and talked like I never could before. The most memorable part was a specific moment when I peaked; one of my friends was petting my head, and I totally understood why cats rub up on your hand when you pet them. This is exactly what I was doing.&nbsp; 8)

				Some toothless old hippies (wonder if they are still alive now) sold me and a friend some World Cup acid, white with gold edges and a football logo, at Glastonbury 1982, a World Cup year. Retreated to tent in the afternoon to avoid the rain, realized as we were starting to fly that the tent leaked and we were sat in an inch of water.<br /><br />Then the ground began to shake, we stumbled out to find Black Uhuru on stage with Sly and Robbie on the rhythms. The bass was vibrating the whole hill! Needless to say we got as close as we could to the speakers, and I don&#039;t remember a single thing about the rest of the weekend. Overwhelming.<br /><br />Obviously that makes me a bit old, time for a cup of tea and wait for the nurse to come and give me a bed-bath.....

				Me and a friend were given two high quality 8b of coke a couple days before we were going to a concert. The entire trip turned into a re-creation of Fear and Loathing. There were some terrifying parts (such as doing lines off a CD cover in the parking lot of a casino with several cops walking by), but also some amazing parts. I&#039;ll never forget doing one huge rail a piece and getting in the elevator with a younger couple. They knew we were wasted, but they were drunk and jealous and we all laughed together the whole ride down. It&#039;s one of those weekends I&#039;ve tried to recreate many times, but the spontaneity of everything makes that impossible.

				MDMA with a girl I loved, very hard to beat that.&nbsp; Only thing that came close was an incredibly strong IV speedball, but that felt more like chemically induced euphoria than actual happiness, if that makes sense
