				i decided to take my girlfriend out last night to a&nbsp; dinner and a movie. It was my turn to pick and i saw a poster of Dwayn the rock Johnson looking bad ass .&nbsp; this will do! the movie starts with a teenager on skype with his friend bragging&nbsp; about how much money he is making selling e. The friend basically forces this teenager to take a shipment for him and states he could make some money too. The next day &quot;quick ship &quot; a fedex nock off nocks on his door and asks him to sign !!! First mistake! at this point i announce to my girlfriend he is getting raided. my girlfriend&nbsp; knows about the road and knows i use it. he than takes the pretty large box to his room and opens to see 250 pills of &quot;e&quot; . he pulls it out to see a note and a blinking box with DEA on it. They bust in and take him down. his friend got caught sending E and made a plea saying he could get them another person willing to sell e. The prosecutor says that if he can give up another drug dealr we can nock down his charge but if he dosent he will be going to jail for 10-30 years. The son&nbsp; was tricked and all he knew of was a legal pot grower ( medical state) . The rock takes it in to his own hands and meets with the federal&nbsp; attorney who is pro occupied with her run for senator. after fighting he gets her to agree to letting the boy out with 6 months if the rock helps bring in at least a half kilo arrest. The rock than spends the rest of the movie infiltrating a Mexican coke operation offering his shipping company as a transportation means.&nbsp; The DA goes back on her offer because they are able to go after the big gang boss. the rock than takes the law into his own hands , ditches the DEA and takes down the drug delars and forces a 84,00,000 dollar bust on the cash he was transporting. The DA gives them wit sec and the son is released. The movie ends with a quote stating that drug possession holds prison terms as equal to rape.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have no idea what to think , was this made to show people the horrible&nbsp; drug laws or to scare people from shipping drugs... My girlfriend is now convinced Im going to jail. From this movie i got never sign for shit and mailing drugs is very well known crime... <br /><br /><br />

				Just a movie lol and I&#039;m pretty sure this is so obvious that I don&#039;t even need to say it but never order anything to any address that has illegal drugs or guns already in the home first off and if you have to make sure it&#039;s a very small amount and if possible keep it down to one order at a time. Drugs get delivered through the mail everyday, I&#039;d expect the bigger the shipment the bigger of a chance you have of being busted.

				I&#039;ve always learned a lot about drug dealing through movies aha. As it showed in the movie, NEVER I MEAN EVER sign for package I don&#039;t care if the price is perfect it&#039;s always SAFETY first. A good vendor would never make you sign for a package. Also, if you are buying quantity never send contraband to where you shit at. How ever if it&#039;s for personal use, I would do it.&nbsp;
