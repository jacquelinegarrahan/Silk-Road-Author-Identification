				Title: <strong>Are express packages left in your mailbox?</strong><br />

				I usually order priority or first class mail which is always left in my mailbox. The one time I&#039;ve ever ordered an express package (it was actually just an envelope), the USPS mailman drove up my driveway at the usual delivery time, parked his little truck, and knocked on my door to give me the package, as well as all of my regular mail for that day. There was no signature required, but needless to say, it practically gave me a heart attack because I thought I was getting a CD.<br /><br />Is that what usually happens with express mail? Or do you guys just get express items left in your mailbox?

				There are probably quite a few variables which led your postperson to deliver to your door...<br /><br />For instance....if you get along with your postperson...then maybe thay didnt want to leave a package in your mailbox...<br /><br />maybe the parcel didnt fit into your mailbox....&nbsp; <br /><br />ya got the parcel and no LE showed up so you&#039;re good ...in my opinion&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />Peace &amp; Hugs&nbsp; :)<br /><br />ChemCat<br /><br />&nbsp;O0

				if signature confirmation wasn&#039;t selected with express delivery then it is usually just left in the mail box, unless the mailman wanted to hand deliver.

				Strange, I actually don&#039;t know who delivers my mail&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I know some people are friendly with or can at least recognize who regularly delivers their mail, but I dunno who delivers mine. It usually comes around the same time every day, but it&#039;s always just a small USPS truck driving down my road that stops at my mailbox for a few seconds. Pretty typical, so I dunno who&#039;s actually in the truck.<br /><br />This was several weeks ago, so I know I&#039;m okay, I&#039;m just wondering how you guys typically receive express mail. That express envelope could&#039;ve fit in my mailbox, and no signature was required, so I&#039;m just wondering why it was hand delivered to my door. Seems pretty courteous, but it still freaked me out at the time. Maybe it&#039;s just my postman, though, as I&#039;ve seen him hand deliver stuff to my neighbors once or twice before&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Do all postmen hand deliver express items?

				You should read the new posts something like&quot;advise from a postal worker&quot; refresh your newbie forum now...itll be there. But the answer from what ive readnis no. They have discretion as to whether they want it signed. But bc they have to treat exprexs with kit gloves they may lwave a notice if ure not there. But the key is to go to get it, y? U ask, bc in a few weeks they can open it...and now the shit begins
