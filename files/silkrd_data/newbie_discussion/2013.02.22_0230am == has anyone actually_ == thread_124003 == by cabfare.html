				not intended on using it<br />sounds terrible<br /><br />why do it when i could instead use mushrooms or mescaline<br /><br /><br />i&#039;m only curious as to its effects on humans.&nbsp; besides killing them<br />i know paint releases formaldehyde while its drying&nbsp; &nbsp;and thats gotten me dizzy before, kinda stomach heavy <br />from painting inside with windows open but no fan&nbsp;

				&quot;A liquid mixture of PCP has long been known in slang terms as &quot;Embalming Fluid&quot; and when people speak of sherms as dipped in embalming fluid they are referring, knowingly or otherwise, to this slang term for PCP.<br /><br />This has been a point of some considerable confusion by users of sherm cigarettes, many of whom think they are in fact smoking embalming fluid and not PCP. It is suspected in fact that this point of confusion has led to ill-informed dealers actually procuring and using actual embalming fluid, either with or without PCP added, to make sherm cigarettes.&quot;<br /><br />Could be the slang term, or of course someone taking it literally.

				yeah surprised you haven&#039;t heard of it! starring michael c hall (dexter!), peter krause and the crazy old ghost lady maid in american horror story in season 1 who would like be a young woman in the eyes of men.. i haven&#039;t seen the second season yet so not sure who she is in that..<br />it&#039;s a hbo drama (2001-2005) about a family who run a funeral home. they do all the embalming for open casket which is NOT the done thing over in the uk! creeps me out. the first ep young screwup highschool girl smokes meth for the first time then finds out her dad just died in a car crash and is freaking the fuck out in a hospital. weird show.. i gave up on it part way through season one but people do rate it verrry highly, it&#039;s got 8.9 on imdb! i&#039;ve just got a feeling the meth smoking boyfriend was trying to get some formaldehyde to smoke though<br />michael c halls character is gay in it which i found really weird as i watched dexter first and just think of him as a sorta asexual oddball.

				tell me about it, i download EVERYTHING. i watch mainly american tv there&#039;s so much more choice and british shows only do like 6 episodes a year, step it up lazies. i am a huge fan of almost everything showtime. united states of tara is hugely underrated! nurse jackie, weeds, the big c, the l word, dexter i mean fucking hell that&#039;s some quality programming and those seasons tend to be 12 eps rather than 24.<br />the uk channels don&#039;t even pick up the best shows! i mean we still don&#039;t have community, parks and rec is yet to grace our screens but we got new girl so damn fast! so yer if i didn&#039;t download i&#039;d be watching some bollocks show about some people who want to buy a house somewhere, go look at houses then can&#039;t decide on a house. or jeremy kyle. that&#039;s british tv. although i am enjoying derek at the moment so different from anything ricky gervais has done before and karl pilkington is amazing in it. just tells everyone to fuck off. touches my heart.<br /><br />anyway if you liked x files maybe you&#039;d like fringe. i found it a bit too confusingly sci-fi. this is weird i have recommended 2 shows that i didn&#039;t find riveting enough to persevere with myself haha<br />i have gone completely off topic and i&#039;m not even high

				oh god the mighty boosh was pure awful at times.. at places it was ok but it was just soooo random. for some reason it reminds me of flight of the conchords, we haven&#039;t mentioned new zealand yet. and that&#039;d be the reason hahaha only show i can think of<br />my attention span is generally too short for movies, by the time i&#039;ve figured out who everyone is the movies over<br />recent decent(subjective) british comedy for anyone interested: the IT crowd, gavin and stacey, fresh meat, an idiot abroad(funny doco i guess), miranda, the office and the inbetweeners
