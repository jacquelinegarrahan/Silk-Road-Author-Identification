				NewAmerica (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0464c7178a)<br /><br />Well lets start from the beginning -<br /><br />I first started my first transaction with NewAmerica at 1g. It was very white translucent or off-white. Dosed 0.1 and had me rolling tits. VERY strong euphoria and some friends had eye wiggles and were floored at 0.2. The rocks were very dense and it was even hard to break.<br />Best stuff I have ever had!<br /><br />2nd time I purchased 5gs of the same thing and it was bomb.<br /><br />3rd time I got 10gs and this was the fishy one. This time I received very yellow/brown/tan crystals. This was very fluffy and very easy to break apart. It really seemed like it should&#039;ve weighed more than 10gs. Then again, it&#039;s very fluffy.<br />-Dosed 0.1 and comeup was very drugged up feeling. It was very sedating too but I barely felt any euphoria. Comeup was even&#039;t great, kinda felt depressed. Sick as well.<br />I had friends who also tried it and some told me that they had visuals. Some even said that their hands were growing and stuff. Also had lots of friends who threw up on it, but then afterwards, felt good and mint. Comedown was also terrible. Many felt sick the next day (comedown). <br /><br /><br />SO then I did some searching and found someone with the same feedback as me. I&#039;m not trying to degrade this vendor either. Just really confused and answers would be appreciated. <br /><br />Users should be cautious, this stuff personally made me iffy. I didn&#039;t even try it again after the first time because I didn&#039;t enjoy it :/<br /><br />I hope this may be helpful to someone.<br /><br />QUOTE FROM TheRoller(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=129424.msg1251112#msg1251112)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">New America&#039;s MDMA<br /><br />Hello SR<br /><br />I recently purchased New America&#039;s MDMA (1g)<br /><br />I am messaging you because what he is selling is not mdma.<br /><br />He is scamming people.<br /><br />What he is actually selling is a chemical called &quot;MDP-2-P&quot; also called &quot;Piperonylacetone&quot;<br /><br />MDP-2-P is a sassafras-smelling oil that is yellow colored.<br /><br />New America&#039;s product is bright yellow crystals ... Not anywhere near the color in his picture.<br /><br />The chemical is similar ... it has 4 carbon analogues of a mdma but these are totally inactive.<br /><br />Since the structure of this chemical is similar to mdma, a cheap testing kit will show positive results for mdma.<br /><br />If however it is tested by a professional lab/ chemists it will prove to be MDP-2-P.<br /><br />SR should not be allowed to sell imitation drugs.<br /><br />I hope you take this message seriously because MDP-2-P is a dangerous chemical and is known to produce undesiarble effects such as hallucinations, panic attacks, and convulsions.<br /><br />I tested it out and it was by no means an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />It causes visual distortions/hallucinations similar to low doses of lsd... Molly is not supposed to produce hallucinations.<br /><br />I would also like to add that that it has a very strong/ speedy come up... and a horrible comedown.<br /><br />The hangover the next day is similar to drinking two liters of vodka.<br /><br /><br /><br />This shit sucks...<br /><br /><br />........<br /><br />I am looking to order real mdma, &quot;domestic&quot;<br /><br />who has the best?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Well, he might&#039;ve gotten a new batch. I&#039;m not sure if he still has the same one since he was down for a bit. <br /><br />So I wouldn&#039;t base this review/post on his current stuff now.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, he gave me one of the best products ever. <br /><br />Best person to ask is people who currently getting it as of now.

				There is another vendor out there right now whose also selling fishy MDMA. I also got pretty similar visual hallucinations to a low dose of lsd from it, but my stuff was fluffy white, like flour almost and it stuck to everything, even the inside of the bag. It also tested positive for MDMA with a Marquis test, but I am sure it was cut, you could easily notice two differently textured and colored substances. I won&#039;t name names because I don&#039;t have solid proof, but this MDMA was nothing like any I&#039;ve had. Someone else also shared their concerns in the vendors rating, so I&#039;m not alone with my opinion. <br /><br />The vendor is currently not listing that product though.
