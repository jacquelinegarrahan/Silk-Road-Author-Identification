				I had a transaction with this vendor SRSuperfky, now the listing is gone and I guess I am getting nervous?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t look like I can even post a review to the review thread, doesn&#039;t seem to be locked but there isn&#039;t a reply button.&nbsp; There are other threads that are like this so I guess I was also wondering if I have to have a certain number of posts to reply in the area of the forum? Any advice, info would be appreciated, here is the link for the review thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138449.msg964712#msg964712

				50 posts to post anywhere else, try to review on his vendor page itself, if you can&#039;t you may still need to finalize, or he may have closed shop and run away, not really sure with that guy, he seemed a bit suspicious.&nbsp; Kinda curious though, how was it?

				To scared to try, it seems like no one has really posted as to there quality, the reviews on the vendor page seem a lil too kind.&nbsp; Is there way to edit your review on SR once you finalize, doesn&#039;t seem to be.&nbsp; Ah I remeber getting shafted so much IRL back in the day with acid so I wouldn&#039;t care if its fake, but now I&#039;m thinking what if its worse than fake :/

				You can change your reviews, they are on the side in your account page.&nbsp; If its not acid its probably an NBOME, but I wouldn&#039;t expect too many reviews, he basically got bitched out for puffing himself up and not providing any reliable evidence of anything.

				Wow I wish I could get some, but the listing from this vendor is gone, kind of weird.&nbsp; And he said they they went through half a sheet in a week but no reviews.&nbsp; Kind of scary, that is by roger.<br /><br />Hey I was wondering can nbome be any good?

				My understanding is they are more similar to 2C-x type drugs than LSD, but if they were completely no good nobody would ever buy them :)&nbsp; Nobody is going to be able to tell you if you will like it before you try it though.
