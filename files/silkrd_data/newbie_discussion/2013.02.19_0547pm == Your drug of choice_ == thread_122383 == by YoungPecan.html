				I would definitely say opiates are my drug of choice.&nbsp; After trying opiates there is no other high that compares.&nbsp; The intense euphoria you get from opiates is unbeatable in my opinion.&nbsp; It also ranks of top for me because if the dose is controlled you can be quite productive and go unnoticed when under the influence.&nbsp; All the other drugs cause confusion for me with the exception of stimulants. Stimulants make me anxious and I hate feeling up tight.&nbsp; Opiates relax me and make my outlook positive and I feel motivation to do more in my life.&nbsp; I hate cannabis now.&nbsp; I use to love it in highschool but to me it is a cheap high and causes your mind to not be as sharp..&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to be dumbed down when I am high.

				The thing is, I love almost everydrug so damn much. It all depends on wht mood I am in. I absolutely love molly, but I love railing oxymorphone just as much. I think what it all boils down to is what you can do the most without adverse effects, since I can smoke weed everyday and be happy as fuck weed may just be the best.

				Used to love coke but then started bangin it and you just cant stay high, plus so expensive here. Been a huge fan of high quality amphetamine for heaps of years then went to Japan and smoked old world fire&nbsp; ice. So many hot willing naughty girls there to play with and the ice made anything possible.<br />Love that Drug but it can fuk you hard if you dont down time regularly. I put in place the 14 day rule, seems for me thats how long it takes to reup my head chems.<br />I would like to do some coke,ice, mdma and some more hot Japanese chicks, i guess those hot chicks are now mlfs or even grannys now.<br />And that is why i like ice, i would be doin those mlfs and grannys for sure
