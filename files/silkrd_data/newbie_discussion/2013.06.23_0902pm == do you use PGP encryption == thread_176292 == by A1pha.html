				I use it.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t make an order without it.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty reckless in my eyes, as well in a lot of reputable vendors eyes.&nbsp; Most vendors will cancel orders if not encrypted.&nbsp; When you do something it should be done right and safe.&nbsp; When you change a tire on your car you wouldn&#039;t take the chance of just putting on 2 lug-nuts hand tightened.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not completely sure it&#039;s necessary.&nbsp; Obviously if a vendor requires it, and I want something bad from that vendor, I will learn it.&nbsp; Otherwise, I use vendors who don&#039;t require it.&nbsp; People get a little too paranoid.&nbsp;

				Come on guys, we&#039;re committing federal crimes here (in most countries I know of).<br /><br />There&#039;s no such thing as &quot;too paranoid&quot; lol.<br /><br />Plus, PGP isn&#039;t hard.&nbsp; There are plenty of brilliant guides on here.&nbsp; There&#039;s even a Newbie PGP club.<br /><br />While it&#039;s true that communications through SR are already encrypted, you want as many layers of security as you can get.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t amazon, (if only it were that simple -.-)<br /><br />~ST

				I don&#039;t think the crime is actually committed until the package is placed in the federally run mailing system.&nbsp; &nbsp;Transmitting a mailing address to another party via the internet isn&#039;t a federal crime, that I&#039;m aware of ........

				If you don&#039;t encrypt sensitive information with PGP, you are trusting that the Silk Road has been programmed in a bulletproof way.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have that level of trust, so I encrypt sensitive information with PGP.<br /><br />Why leave it to trust when you can take charge of the situation and look after your security yourself?

I don&#039;t know if soliciting the purchase of a controlled substance is a crime in your jurisdiction, but I can assure you it is enough to arouse suspicion. And suspicion is all the police need to justify further investigation.<br /><br />EDIT - just re-reading this and I sound like a bit of a cock. Everyone&#039;s level of risk is different. We should all do what we&#039;re comfortable with, but for goodness&#039; sake, make sure you are at least aware of what risks you are running.

				You&#039;re pretty much an idiot if you don&#039;t use it. I really don&#039;t see why you wouldn&#039;t, it&#039;s very easy.<br /><br />Having SR or its logs be compromised is not a very far-fetched scenario. I&#039;d rather encrypt my address than save 30 seconds to send it unencrypted and risk possible arrest for no good reason at all.

				Not needed for SR since all communications are already encrypted. Never heard of a problem using SR encryption only, and probably never will. But if the vendor requires it you should use it.

				PGP was the steepest part of the SR learning curve for me. Using TAILS its as easy as writing some text and pushing the &quot;Encrypt&quot; button.<br /><br />It&#039;s been said, you can&#039;t be too paranoid.

				I didn&#039;t place an order until I figured out PGP and imported the public keys of the sellers I was interested in. I wish vendors would sen their communications encrypted to buyers, but I guess at least keeping my address and name confidential is better than nothing.

Then it is decrypted with the corresponding private key, which only that vendor has. Normally you would include your public key, in case the vendor wants to reply in an encrypted format.

				@m1ddle no you dont need to send them your public key, because they arent going to send you any info that needs to be encrypted.&nbsp; <br />Guys im a slacker/stoner/drugie who barely pays the rent(very irresonsible).&nbsp; I play it pretty fast and loose and i use pgp, you just <br />have to know that all of this is under constant scrutiny.&nbsp; It may seem like ebay, but much of this is illegal.<br />
