				In 2013, for the first time, US intelligence officials stated that cyber warfare is considered a larger threat than terrorism.<br /><br />The internet is my playground, where I explore dark corners of the internet and test possibilities. The harder the challenge the better. It is extremely rare that I cannot accomplish the task at hand. I will never attack an onion website, so please do not ask. I whole heartily support onion-based websites, Silk Road, and other scandalous endeavors.Just testing the waters right now, if it goes well, I may offer other hacking services.<br /><br />* Disable any website for 24 hours - 1 btc<br />* Disable any website for 72 hours - 3 btc<br />* Disable any website for 1 week - 6 btc<br />* Disable any website for 1 month - 20 btc<br /><br />Use my services to stress test your own servers, destroy the competition, revenge, extortion, protection rackets, be creative! Clever folk can easily force a website or their insurance company into forking over quite a bit of money, after proving that you can take down their website. You would be surprised how many insurance plans cover it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been hacking banks and government computers for more than 10 years, and there is nothing they can do to stop me. I&#039;ve had access to university servers, news stations, governments, banks and more. My attacks slice right through Cloudflare, as well as hardware and software-based firewalls. Very few websites can handle it. Don&#039;t ask me to attack Google, the FBI, or something stupid like that.<br /><br />Is there anyone out there who is interested and would like a free trial? All I ask is that you provide an honest review to the community afterwards.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t do business with a vendor that accepts anything other than bitcoin, which this &quot;gwapo&quot; guy does. He accepts Western Union, PayPal, and others. Fuck that. That&#039;s how you get caught. I know for a fact that PayPal was using a bug in Firefox websockets to find the &quot;real IP&quot; of people who use their website. Even if you&#039;re behind Tor, if you are using a vulnerable version of Firefox, PayPal probably knows your real IP.<br /><br />I am a professional, and not just some dumb kid. Your security and my security is just as important as the job at hand. More even. What&#039;s the point of partaking in a service like this if you&#039;re just going to get busted because some script kiddie forgot to turn on remote DNS resolution?<br /><br />If you want it &quot;quick and dirty&quot; on a shoestring budget, I&#039;m not your guy.

				Sale of goods or services is not permitted without a Silk Road vendor account. I am also of the opinion that the service being offered would fall under the Restricted Items category, specifically as something &quot;who&#039;s purpose is to harm&quot;.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Seller%27s_Guide#Restricted_items<br /><br />Locking this thread.<br /><br />Libertas
