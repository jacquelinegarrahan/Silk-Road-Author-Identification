				Hi all, i&#039;ve been buying from a vendor lucymcgee many time before and&nbsp; never had a problem with shipping. But my recent order didn&#039;t come for some reason. the mailman usually just leave the package outside or in your mailbox even when i&#039;m not home, but not this time they left a notice for redeliver because nobody was home. i thought it was weird so i contacted Lucy and let her know. Lucy shows me the tracking #s and it said it delivered a couple days later, which i think is must be a mistake because i was at home that day and didn&#039;t receive any package at all. i even checked with my neighbor. Did any of you guys had this kind of problem before? i wonder is it because they seized my package?

				hmmm if the tracking # says it arrived but it hasnt it seems that either someone stole it or it was seized but im no expert. Have you read over all his reviews to see if any1 else experienced the same problem?

				i dont think someone i know personally would stole it since nobody knows what it is beside me. second if it got delivered to wrong house but that person must seen the name and they shoulda return the box, but is been more than 2 weeks. and i think lucy only had problems with &quot;express shipping&quot; in the past.

				99% of the time, your order has been stolen on your front step or whatever.&nbsp; If your order was seized, the post office will likely tell you it has. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />LucyMcgee<br />CultMadeline<br /><br />
