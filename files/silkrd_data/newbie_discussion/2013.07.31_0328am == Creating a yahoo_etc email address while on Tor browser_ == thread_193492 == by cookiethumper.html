				Hi, so with bitinstant down, the best option I&#039;ve found from other people in the forums is localbitcoins.com, which looks to be easy to use. I want to sign up with an account anonymously so I can have the bitcoins sent straight to SR, not having to wait 6 hours AFTER I get home from work (would do a BoA deposit in the morning) for it to go through the fog, leaving ample time for bitcoin prices to change and leave me screwed. I can&#039;t access tormail at all tonight as I&#039;ve seen others can&#039;t either. Would it be safe to create a yahoo email address, using tor browser, and only access it through tor? I wouldn&#039;t need the actual contents of emails to be secure as I would only be using it to buy bitcoins legitimately. Would there be any way for my identity to be compromised if I did this? Any help would be appreciated.

				See &quot;Planning First Purchase&quot; thread, just a few down from this thread.&nbsp; There is a post about yahoo emails in it that may help you as I have been having trouble accessing my new Tormail account.&nbsp; HTH&nbsp; (I finally got in my Tormail tonight; after disabling my firewall.)&nbsp;

				I could never get a tormail address, so I created a Yahoo mail account (that I only access through Tor).&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t easy.&nbsp; I had to answer tons of questions and they keep on wanting me to give them a mobile phone # and stuff, I just left that off.&nbsp; I made up various info for the security questions and kept notes of what they are.<br /><br />They autodetect what country you&#039;re accessing them from and try to suggest what location you&#039;re in, etc.<br /><br />When I log in to access it, that&#039;s a hassle too, because with Tor they see me logging in from around the world, so they assume my account has been hacked.&nbsp; I pretty much always have to jump through hoops to prove I&#039;m accessing the email legitimately.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Ah, thanks good to know. I had a hell of a time getting it created, at first it wouldn&#039;t take my captcha AT ALL no matter how many times I tried. Then I tried again and made sure I put the same country as my IP was from (was easier to tell this time as everything was in French, lol). Now I know I need to&nbsp; change the secret questions to something I can actually make a note of since I just put random stuff while it was in french!

				I don&#039;t know, I&#039;d be nervous about using any of the big name providers even over tor if they let you register that way. I&#039;m guessing you had to enable javascript to get it to work? That can reveal your true IP to them.
