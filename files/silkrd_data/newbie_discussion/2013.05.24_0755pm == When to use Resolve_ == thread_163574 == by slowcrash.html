				Tomorrow&#039;s mail is the last chance an order has of arriving before auto-finalizing. The vendor states in their profile that shipping does take sometime and is not consistent. The feedback backs this up, everybody seems to get their packages eventually. There are only good mentions of the vendor in the forums and they post in the forums also. According to the vendor&#039;s terms, I would not be eligible for a reship or refund as I do not have tracking to prove it was not delivered. I would like to give the order another week to show up in the mail. Should I use resolve to do this?<br /><br />Would it be better to just finalize with a 5/5 and say in the feedback that product hasn&#039;t been received and then update when it arrives or if it doesn&#039;t show up in a couple more weeks? I&#039;m more concerned about building my rep than this particular order. It&#039;s a small order and mainly for my wife. I&#039;ll just re-order it if it&#039;s not received. <br /><br />There is also the possibility that something happened on my end. My wife wasn&#039;t being careful with the mail and my have thrown it out as junk mail. I&#039;ve asked her to be more careful in the future but if it showed early there is a chance this happened.<br /><br />Which would seem as less offensive to a vendor - having 5/5 feedback stating product was not received or having it go to resolve while waiting for it to show up in another week?

				hey, my opinion is go to resolution and request to extend the ship date. i wouldn&#039;t finalize without being sure you get the product.

Once you enter resolution the finalise period is automatically extended by 5 days, and you can request a further extension of necessary. Vendors do not consider it offensive for an order to be brought to resolution - that is the normal procedure if an item has not turned up yet.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let it auto-finalise as this will negatively impact your purchasing stats.<br /><br />Libertas

Silk Road might go down for maintenance, or you could experience login problems etc., and if the order auto-finalises it will impact badly on your purchasing stats. Once it&#039;s in resolution you can finalise any time you like if you receive it before the new due-date.<br /><br />Libertas
