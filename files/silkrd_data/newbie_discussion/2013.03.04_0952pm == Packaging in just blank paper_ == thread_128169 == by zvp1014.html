				Hi–<br /><br />It seems to me that a lot of sellers just like to package their product in multiple folded up sheets of blank paper. Is there really any point to this? Seems mighty suspicious to me if I opened up the envelope searching for drugs.

				It&#039;s ridiculous. <br /><br />Vendors should be super stealthy all the time.. When messing with peoples lives, which is essentially what they are doing (people can lose jobs and what not if ever caught with drugs) then they need to be super careful. <br /><br />There is enough info on this forum (an open forum) for any vendor to think of a successful packaging method, so there is no excuse for lousy packaging in my eyes. <br /><br />I have worked out what I consider to be the &#039;best packaging I&#039;ve seen&#039; for when I start vending in the next little while. People just have to remember that stealth means that even if the customs open the package, they shouldn&#039;t even think about taking a twice look. Which isn&#039;t hard to do when you actually think about it.

				Im a new vendor and even i know better than that. That method is mostly used for Meth Shards. I&#039;ve seen some elaborate methods and was told by the people who do it that it really isn&#039;t necessary to get fancy with it but they do just in case. For the most part, No One cares whats in your&nbsp; damn box or envelope. They 9-5 people trying to get through the shift to get home to smoke some bud or get some head from their misses. These guys who just put it in paper, dont care. The chances of the sender getting caught is very little vs the person that receives it. My stealth is subpar vs what i&#039;ve seen. If your mom or dad or spouse or anyone opens it they wont catch it.

				I&#039;ve only received one package that was &quot;stealthed&quot; in blank paper, but it didn&#039;t really bother me much to be honest.&nbsp; From the outside the package was a firm parcel and didn&#039;t seem suspicious in the slightest.&nbsp; Would I like better stealth?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s always needed.

				At least they used paper.... One of my shipments was just a bubble envelope with a clear baggy containing product inside.&nbsp; If anyone would have opened it, it was very obvious what was in there.&nbsp; I was pretty pissed, but the product was good so I forgot about it pretty quickly ;)

				I´ve received one hundred 25i nbome hits. The letter was not suspicious, but there was no stealth method at all. I just opened the envelope and found the blotters in a folded blank sheet of paper. Do I have to ask the vendor to do stealth shipping or it´s quite impossible to bust this kind of drug (since it´s just paper)?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Before I leave the Newbie forums I figured I would check this thread out. I am still curious myself, how exactly do they conceal something like a powder-substance? What is the best way to do that? Also, how would they conceal something like... say, needles/syringes? Those both seem like they would be visible by X-ray or something. The likelihood would be low but wouldn&#039;t it still be visible???

				The people at the post office dont care whats in your parcel. As long as its not letting out a foul odor then they dont care. They&#039;re doing layoffs at the post offices, the job is to process as much mail as they can. Not to worry if there&#039;s a bulge or it looks funny. Just paper pushers lol If someone can get anthrax to someone or a pipe bomb, do you think its impossible for drugs that are wrapped correctly. If you can get it past customs then its a piece of cake domestically.

				lol...&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I received really 2 packages like that, one from a &quot;reputable&quot; vendor...&nbsp; &nbsp;To be fair, the product was in a baggie, but then the baggie was taped to folded paper.&nbsp; The other one I received powders wrapped in a square of wax paper, placed in a paper envelope and then in a mailer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some products were LEGAL to purchase and ship in the not so distant past, and then, they were coming far more stealth than *any* package I have received from vendors here, and its annoying me.&nbsp; My products are not nearly as high risk as others, and its definitely personal quantities, but that doesnt mean I want packages that are obviously drugs being delivered.&nbsp; Even more irritating, is that people rating the product say the package is super stealth, so I am expecting super stealth, to find...&nbsp; discreet, but far from stealth.&nbsp; And of course, certain vendors hold buyers hostage if they do not leave perfect feedback, so, before ya know it, everyone is calling crappy packaging stealth.

				I received a bunch of blank papers folded around the bagged product in a plain white envelope. You could feel this suspicious bump right through it. The fake return address made no sense and combined with this shady packaging I was none too pleased. It was a very reputable vendor with a lot of feedback saying they were stealthy but this really puts me off buying from them again. It&#039;s frustrating that something like that could potentially cause a lot of very real problems for buyers. Incarcerated customers aren&#039;t good customers. I&#039;d be happy to pay more for shipping/stealth if necessary. It&#039;s pretty important.

				Ya all these dumb vendors arent taking this shit serious enough...it is very easy to get a package flagged for a further look, and all packages even shipped domestically in the US have to cross an inspectors eyes at some point..the inspectors watch everything on the conveyor belt. They pull an envelope or package off the belt and give things further inspection at a minimum of 20times per day just to make themselves feel like they are doing&nbsp; their job. They also have dogs come in on a regular schedule. Most vendors on SR are just what society thinks of the drug world, careless dumbasses.&nbsp; Most of these vendors aren&#039;t thinking or caring enough to realize that when they are touching their product, vacuum sealing it, and then touching the vacuum seal&#039;s outside again to put it in the envelope they mail to you, that they are getting minute bits of drug on the outside of the vacuum sealed plastic. Washing the plastic isnt good enough ether...if there&#039;s drugs in the room and your busy doing multiple orders at the same time, there&#039;s noway these careless vendors are going to get even one envelope smell proof to the super powered dog nose...I guarantee you it can&#039;t be done, nomatter how hard they try...don&#039;t use vacuum seal use plastic lamenents or buy the damn perfect shippers secrets guide listed on SR. People are putting their customers w federal cases at a huge risk with their lack of caring. Or lying to themselves and saying &quot;what Im doing is good enough...and listen to marlo&#039;s attitude...hes a vendor for H, I was thinking about purchasing from him, but now I know he will surely get his buyers fucked with his attitude...he needs to do more research. Dont just say &quot;ah hell it wont get caught&quot; and be satisfied thinking u did enuff, no if someones plea deal got fucked up cuz the DA decided they look like their using drugs from SR and now they have taken the good deal away then that wud be on the vendor. And marlo in yur post u were trying to make it sound like u do a really good job w packaging, but heres what u said, &quot;my packaging is subpar to other vendors&quot; Ya I believe it is subpar!! WTF man how do u find this site but dont know the correct meaning of subpar!
