				Another kid died today because he couldn&#039;t handle the drugs he had access to: http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/17887955/drug-warning-for-teens/ <br /><br />I know if I had had access to SR in high school, I probably would have created a lot of problems for myself.<br /><br />I assume the concept of any kind of restrictions to SR will not be welcome. But I think it&#039;s an interesting discussion. <br /><br />It seems the only time SR receives international scrutiny is when an underage kid kills himself on SR drugs, or when an underage kid&#039;s mom intercepts their package of SR drugs.<br /><br />My guess is it wouldn&#039;t even really be possible to implement, but would you be opposed to an 18 and over restriction?

				There would be absolutely no way to enforce something like that and it will probably never happen. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Fuck it, put Darwin&#039;s theories to the test i say. If a kid is dumb enough to kill themselves, let them. We&#039;ll be better off if those types don&#039;t reproduce&nbsp; ;D

				&nbsp;I would support it in spirit but it just doesn&#039;t work. Im not worried&nbsp; of things like nbome. Kids flying out windows is quite rare, just big news and big impact. No pun intended.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s the opiates,and other hard drugs that teens don&#039;t have the life experience to deal with. Could easily lead to lots of OD&#039;S and lots of lost college years.

				It will never happen. We should think that tighter controls will ultimately save our youth but it truly boils down to personal responsibility and individual safety parameters. Self control is a must while venturing off the well beaten path of drugs. One must learn many things before even taking certain drugs and LSD or it&#039;s derivatives are certainly not the starting point for which spacial attempts at &quot;FLIGHT&quot; become. What I am trying to say is that this particular individual was probably having a great time and the cause of his dismay was not the drugs but a wrong decision upon taking them. <br /><br />He was probably feeling gooooooood and attempted some dumb shit.

				Like on a porn site when it says &quot;Click here if you are an adult&quot;, and you cannot see the porn until you click it?<br /><br />Most kids figure out how to get around that sort of thing.

				Irregardless of whether it is a good idea or not, I see not practicable way to implement it. How would it be enforced? You must submit a photo ID to support to have your account age verified?

				The reporter who wrote that article is stupider than any teenager I have ever met.<br /><br />Being completely ignorant about drugs is one thing, but to professionally write on that subject when being comletely ignorant is just stupid.
