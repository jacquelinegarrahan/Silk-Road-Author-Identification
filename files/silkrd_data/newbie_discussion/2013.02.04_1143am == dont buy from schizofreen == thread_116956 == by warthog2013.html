				hey, i&#039;m sad to hear you had to deal with an asshole.. you know there&#039;s a &#039;resolve&#039; option for cases exactly like this? also, I know americans think that the rest of the world is just one big unity out there to terrorize your beloved states and make fruity porn for your internet browser.... however that is not the case. You met one asshole! ...ONE! ...don&#039;t take this out on the rest of the population over here, don&#039;t be so narrowminded!<br /><br />that&#039;s all, kthx.

				Schizofreen has ALWAYS been my go to guy for mdxx related medication hands down. he always has timely responses to PM&#039;s, his products are by far more then top notch, shipping sometimes takes a bit longer then some, but it 9/10 times always show up. and the guy himself is a real nice vendor to do business with. very friendly, and reasonable guy always has been, even goes out of his way for me on some occasions. I am truly sad that he changed his shipping policy&#039;s, but you have no idea whats goin on over in his life, nor do you know how many orders he gets in a day. im sure the decisions he makes are for the best and if your not looking for a larger supply but you in the USA its pry best to find a different personal amount vendor at this point due to his changes. Calling him a &quot;fucking prick&quot; or sayin the dutch don&#039;t know how to do business is completely outta line man, and if that&#039;s how you try to do business with people i could see why he did cancel your order. and im sure if that .03 BTC was that valuable to you mr high roller you could have messaged him and worked it out, or as MyOtherNickIsAwesome pointed out hit the &#039;resolve&#039; button.

				He seems to be having a great deal of in real life problems - give him a break and let him explain himself. <br /><br />You lost .3 BTC, that&#039;s a couple of dollars if it&#039;s that big a deal to you I&#039;ll replace it if you stop your bitchin&#039;

				Schizo is a stand up guy.&nbsp; Have had interactions with him in the past and he seems to really be trying.&nbsp; He&#039;s definitely better than a lot of those broken-english dutch guys selectively scamming USA customers.<br /><br />He even went back and filled orders for people AFTER he had serious IRL issues...

				I&#039;ve ordered from Schizofreen twice before, and for a third time just now, and all I can say is he is an A+ vendor. His communication is lightning speed, his stealth is creative &amp; sneaky, and his MDMA is incredible. You have to try his PARTYFLOCK pills, best roll I&#039;ve ever had just the other weekend. It&#039;s a shame he no longer ships small listings to the US anymore, but he knows he doesn&#039;t want to bite off more than he can chew so I support it, especially if it means his services will be even more fantastic. I just placed a bulk order with him, can&#039;t wait.

				I&#039;ve had the same thing happen to me a couple of weeks ago, but Schizo was professional and we resolved it easily. Why not just communicate with the seller and work things out?

				It&#039;s too bad to hear that OP had a bad experience with Schizo. I have had two great experiences with him, and his pills are very good. Stealth is even better. I am not from the US though, but I have had a few orders that didn&#039;t work out, and it does suck...<br /><br />JJ

				Stealth is not quite that good, actually -- I [and everyone else whose hands the envelope passed by] could smell the product without opening the letter. But I shouldn&#039;t mention more than that for safety reasons.
