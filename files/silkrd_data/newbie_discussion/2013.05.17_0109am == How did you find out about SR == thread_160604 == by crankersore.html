				I read an article in the UK Guardian about Bitcoins. The article mentioned the use of BT to buy &#039;illegal drucks&#039; on SR. Sounded good, so I sought out a linked article about SR that gave instructions on how to get to SR (via ToR etc.).<br /><br />Thank you to the wonderful Guardian newspaper I found SR!<br /><br />

				About a year ago I was looking to buy some herb and I found myself looking online and found about tor and the silk road through various canna culture websites.&nbsp; Back then buying btc wasn&#039;t so simple and easy&nbsp; so I ended up getting connects IRL instead.<br /><br />Recently I realized how easy BTC are to get so I am here and if this all works out I doubt I will ever go back to getting stuff IRL.

				I used to be big time into clubbing and XTC. Drifted away from the scene over the last few years as the clubs I went to began shutting down and dealers shifted towards Coke.<br /><br />I started getting into legal highs in attempt to recapture that rave vibe. Did truffles for a while before researching mescaline.<br /><br />It was when watching a You Tube video of someone&#039;s mescaline trip however that I first saw a message in the comments section saying &quot;why don&#039;t you just buy some proper drugs off Silk Road (instead of taking mescaline).&quot;<br /><br />That was when I first learnt of SR. A bit of a strange way admittedly but I&#039;d like to thank that person and also let them know that this fellow You Tube user has been enjoying &quot;proper&quot; drugs ever since!

				Thankyou The Sun newspaper - they did an article where two reporters ordered off SR, I just typed in silk road, deepweb, and tor into my browser and bob&#039;s your uncle, easy enough to find from there. Wiki is the best though.

				Good friend who was already a user told me about it. I already knew about tor, and pgp encryption so I thought just the idea of this place was fucking amazing. A good bit later and Im still learning crazy shit all the time about security and anonymity, I Love you SilkRoad!

				I found out about it from a friend, who in turn had read about it in a mainstream newspaper... I hope SR prevails over attempts by governments to restrict individual freedom!

				Down the pub! But the person who mentioned it had never actually used it. Wikipedia article had useful referenced footnotes and articles that led me here.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s not easy if you are not that tech-savy, which I am (was) not. So a big shout-out to all the SR community because we have all negotiated the necessary hurdles that keep us, SR, and DPR safe and anonymous.<br /><br />Keep up your vigilance and care, and long may the Road run.

				I was at home for summer holidays, and met with a friend. He told me he wanted to hack a site, and then he found some links to the dark side of the web, and he showed me everything. I&#039;ve joined immediately&nbsp; :)
