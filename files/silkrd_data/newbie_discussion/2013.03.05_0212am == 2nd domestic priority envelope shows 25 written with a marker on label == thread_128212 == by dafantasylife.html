				Hi All,<br /><br />Not sure if this is paranoia getting the best of me. Ive been on SR for over 6 months but recently just started ordering more domestic.. and after a month away, I ordered 3 domestic deliveries about a week apart.. the first one was sent first class mail and came thru fine in a very stealthy legal envelope.. what I noticed from the 2nd and 3rd delivery which were both sent USPS Priority (one in a very thin rectangular box (8&quot; x 6&quot; approx) and the next one was the same dimensions but a flat priority mail envelope. and exactly both of these had a handwritten &quot;25&quot; on the label and the stamps weren&#039;t stamped over (basically I can reuse the stamps if I wanted to)..&nbsp; Im just spooked how both of these prority mail deliveries had the &quot;25&quot; handwritten and the stamps weren&#039;t marked over.. is this normal?

				I&#039;m not really sure why this would be, but if you don&#039;t get a good answer here then get yourself up to 50 posts in one of the spam threads and go post this question over in the Shipping forum.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably nothing and just has to do with the processing of those kinds of Priority packages.&nbsp; But I&#039;m sure a more knowledgeable answer would ease your paranoia more than my speculative thinking lol

				Just to clarify, I can&#039;t seem to post in the shipping forum (there&#039;s now NEW TOPIC button.. I use to be able to but maybe my stats are still making me newbie status).. the two priority mail packages were from two totally different domestic vendors... both had a handwritten 25 on the label and the stamps were not marked as voided...

				I&#039;m not sure how you posted in the Shipping&nbsp; sub-forum before, or if you just thought you did and you didn&#039;t or something.&nbsp; But you have to get to 50 posts before you can post anywhere outside the Newbie Discussion sub-forum.&nbsp; I suggest using one of the spam threads to boost your post count to 50 and then go post this question in the Shipping sub-forum.&nbsp;

				pretty sure it has to do with the processing of priority shipments, but don&#039;t quote me on that.<br />could be parania, could be cause for genuine concern.<br />hope that clears things up&nbsp; ;)

				Sounds funny but have you searched for any terms related?&nbsp; Obviously you can&#039;t search for 25 but perhaps USPS marking / tagging or something to that ilk?&nbsp; Make sense?

				USPS writes numbers on packages all the time, probably a way of sorting things. I wouldn&#039;t worry about it.

				Sometimes they write the specific location of your address along their route.&nbsp; It&#039;s no big deal; mine have something written on them half the time.<br /><br />If you do some digging for the actual route your postman takes, you&#039;ll probably see that the number coincides with your specific... fuck, I don&#039;t remember what they call it.&nbsp; Section, district, fucking something.&nbsp; It&#039;s nothing to worry about, regardless.<br />

				I love in a butt fuck none where but mine come with all sorts of marker writing on them.&nbsp; I know he post office marks hem for rural route delivery groups for each driver. <br /><br />Then I&#039;m sure the vendor must also mark them.n can&#039;t see any harm in it.&nbsp; Nobody would let you have the contraband and have time consume it. :-)
