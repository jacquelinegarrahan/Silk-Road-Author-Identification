				I know Nevita has a thread but I am unable to post there.<br /><br />Anyone had experience with his LSD?<br /><br />He has excellent reviews but it seems from feedback NO ONE has bought LSD, it&#039;s all NBOME.&nbsp; This seems odd to me, plus his blotters are listed as Alpha Centari.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alpha&#039;s are the same art coming from the vendor Lucydrop and if you look at his page you will see they are weak.&nbsp; I can also confirm they are not 100 ug each as listed. <br /><br />I also noticed nevita comment that Lucydrop was &quot;a good guy&quot; and he encouraged other people to use him. So I think these two vendors know each other.&nbsp; Perhaps they are the same person?&nbsp; Drug dealers generally don&#039;t encourage you to use their competition when they have the same product. LSD is not like E pills where a popular design is copied I would think it&#039;s one group who is putting out the Alphas<br /><br />Lucy is saying there was a problem with a batch of blotter but it is sorted out now and some people on his feedback do say it s good stuff (but most say it&#039;s crap)<br /><br />What are your thoughts SR community?&nbsp; I really would like to find some quality LSD but I already got burned once by Lucydrop, who also had excellent feedback until the time I used him.

				Okay lucydrop and nevita are not the same person. It is possible, however unlikely, that they have the exact same LSD, but either way that post was made a month or two before the potency issues with LD&#039;s acid. Besides, street dealers might not recommend other dealers, but this is a community where good character and honesty will go a long way. After two purchases with nevita, I can say with confidence he is a great vendor that takes care of the customer. In my opinion, LD seems like a good vendor with good intentions, although he has had problems recently that have seriously impacted his business.<br /><br />If they have the same LSD, well I&#039;m on it right now (from lucydrop) and I can say it&#039;s definitely not bunk, but also less than the 100 ug advertised. But please remember, a lot of the prints some vendors sell on here use might have different acid on them. Blotter paper can be legally obtained on the open web as a &quot;collector&#039;s item,&quot; I&#039;ve even found a site that sells paper with almost all of the same prints that I&#039;ve seen available on here.
