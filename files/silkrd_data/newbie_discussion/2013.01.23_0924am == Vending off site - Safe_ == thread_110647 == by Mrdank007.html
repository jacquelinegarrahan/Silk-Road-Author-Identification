				As Above...<br /><br />I have all the resources and tools to vend, and the knowledge to move my coins in and out of SR well enough as well as good sources for product (all class A). My only problem is I have been in trouble with the cops a few times before for IRL drug stuff/dealing (which I have now stopped), what is the best way to go about this? I was thinking perhaps renting a lock up or garage for cash in hand and keeping my product inventory and vending tools there, but then my problem would be an electrical supply. I was also thinking of perhaps buying an old van and setting up shop in the back on a side street but again electric supply may be a problem for vacuum sealers, computers, label printers etc. I don&#039;t want to keep anything in my property other than perhaps a few envelopes stamps etc so nothing that could incriminate me. I was thinking of reaching out to a few friends to help, but that isn&#039;t an option as non are near reliable enough and the less anyone knows the better really!<br />Thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Right now I&#039;m thinking of doing a little bit of middle manning from site to friend, nothing drastic and only a couple bucks here and there but if I let my friends know I have connections for anything they want I can just list the price and keep the rest. All the while not touching the product. Hands clean in a sense. Still prosecutable I am sure? but hopefully nothing I can&#039;t beat.

				Hi,<br /><br />Yeah i&#039;ve done that in the past. Just to make it clear though my original question was referring to full time class A vending on SR with product I have IRL.<br /><br /><br />Many thanks!

				Ok yes, I&#039;d say invest in a low income property as you don&#039;t have to usually give ID to rent places (or at least around here you don&#039;t) and can give a fake name. That way your operation is in a place that is not yours. In all reality I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t do it. Though I think having a van and what not would be weird, why not a camper and use a hook up spot at an RV campsite?

				OP your title is very confusing from your post I get you want t vend on SR but you would prefer to package and prep your listings away from your home.<br />If that&#039;s so you&nbsp; need to have enough cash to get some sort of private rental space to do that kinda private activity.<br />You asking if working from the back of a van tells me you arent in the right kinda place in life right now to be taking risks such as being a full time vendor.<br />Please correct me if i&#039;ve misunderstood.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				@Marlon Brando - Yeah a low income room/property for cash rental is probably the best choice (I take the point on board that the van idea is probably both unsafe and impractical) <br /><br />@nomad bloodbath - Yeah I realize my title is a little confusing by &quot;off site&quot; I mean off my property, not off SR ;) cash for a rental property isn&#039;t a problem, my real only worry is cops will watch my entering of said anonymous rental property and keep tabs on me/get a warrant to search the property/rental space. Don&#039;t you think?<br /><br />P.S. You&#039;re right, as I said I have been busted in the past but for nothing online related. I&#039;m in no way misinformed on the best vending practices, my only real problem is keeping product at my house. What do you think?<br /><br />MDank :)
