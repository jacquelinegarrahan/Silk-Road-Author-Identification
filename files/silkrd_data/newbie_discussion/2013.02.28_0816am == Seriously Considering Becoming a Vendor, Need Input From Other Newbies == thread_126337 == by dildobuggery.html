				So here&#039;s the deal. The reason I even came to SR in the first place was to buy a week&#039;s supply of benzos and a week&#039;s supply of alternate painkillers to I could kick a hardcore Tramadol addiction. The reason I got so addicted to them in the first place is because I have total access in the country I live in. They&#039;re not really regulated and they&#039;re DIRT cheap. Right now it costs between $20-25 US Dollars (depending on which of the thousands of places you can buy them here) for a box of 100 50mg. Tramadols. <br /><br />The thing is, I&#039;m feeling a bit of an ethical dilemma. That is to say, what kind of dick does it make me to have gone through hell getting off this shit (and it IS a horrible kick) and then turn around and sell it to other people? Then again, I&#039;m not anyone&#039;s Grandpa either. We all gotta make our own choices. <br /><br />Does it make me a dick to even be considering the possibility of selling something that almost destroyed me liver and gave me the worst withdrawals I&#039;ve ever had? Thoughts?<br /><br />

				I&#039;m sorry to hear about your addiction. And I can relate. When I went to Southeast Asia Tramadol was everywhere and so freaking cheap. I had a tooth problem out there and I bought some to help with the pain. It worked very well and aside from that it had a slight mood elevating effect to it. So I went to several places and kept buying more and brought it back with me. Well, that was gone pretty quick and then a family member got a prescription and she couldn&#039;t take it because of her liver problems and have been giving me the bottles. <br /><br />Now I just take it for no reason because I love the way it makes you feel. I go through it quick though and then go weeks or months without having it. It&#039;s a really under rated &#039;narcotic&#039;. I&#039;ve been thinking about purchasing some here on SR to keep on hand (in case I have a bad day/headache/valid pain/need to get through something), but I&#039;d probably end up burning through it again.<br /><br />With that said, you can&#039;t be responsible for other peoples&#039; choices of how they use drugs and I don&#039;t think you should feel bad. Personally, I know I love Tramadol a little too much, but I&#039;m going to get it from someone if I want it, so it may as well be you.

				I&#039;m firmly of the belief that what people choose to put into their bodies is their business. I certainly don&#039;t think there should be any law against selling tramadol and other such types of drugs... but I also think that everyone has to make choices for themselves in regards to what they believe is ethical, or even if it&#039;s not unethical is it really something they want to do.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never took tramadol. not really into prescription type stuff. I&#039;ve took valium and etizolam a few times. I wouldn&#039;t sell things like tramadol personally because I think they have far more potential for abuse than for recreation. I wouldn&#039;t sell heroin either, for the same reason... it seems more often than not that it has a negative effect on the user, often a life destroying effect. I don&#039;t want it on my conscience that I am supplying people with something that (in a lot of cases) is causing them misery and suffering. I support their right to choose to take these drugs, but I wouldn&#039;t want to be the one supplying them. Without coming off as too much of a hippy, I do believe there is karma (not some mystical force, just a general principle that if you behave badly towards others you will end up suffering yourself as well).<br /><br />That being said, that&#039;s all just my personal preference. I support your right to sell whatever drugs you want... and it doesn&#039;t necessarily make you a dick, at least you are considering the fact that you suffered with it yourself and trying to decide whether you are ok with selling them. If you were a total dick that thought wouldn&#039;t even cross your mind :)

				Don&#039;t turn your back on your conscience.&nbsp; If you feel like it would be the wrong thing to do, even though you could make money the guilt you will feel won&#039;t be worth it.&nbsp; Here&#039;s another thing to consider that is what made me decide to only sell weed as a vendor here on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;m just speaking for myself, and everyone needs to do what they are comfortable with.&nbsp; IRL I sell a highly addictive drug in addition to weed.&nbsp; But I only sell it to people who I know first-hand are already users.&nbsp; I would not sell it to someone using it for their first time and I DEFINITELY wouldn&#039;t sell it to underage kids.&nbsp; On SR, you can&#039;t tell if someone is already an addict and you&#039;re just helping them out with something they need.&nbsp; And you can&#039;t tell how old someone is.&nbsp; You could be creating new addicts every day.&nbsp; And you could be selling to kids without knowing it.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t live with the thought that I had ruined kids&#039; lives by getting them started on an addictive drug when I knew that they would be better off never trying that drug.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t do that just to make a profit.&nbsp; For me, that would be seriously bad karma and I couldn&#039;t live with knowing I did that.&nbsp;

				The best customer is an informed customer - if you sell it make sure to tell the good and the bad of the drug. Put up a notice that you don&#039;t want orders from kids or first timers - have the notice graphic enough that the weak willed will be scared off.
