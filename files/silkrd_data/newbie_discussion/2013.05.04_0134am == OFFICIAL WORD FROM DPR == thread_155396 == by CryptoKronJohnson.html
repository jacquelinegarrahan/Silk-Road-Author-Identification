				Not just safety (which is definitely a paramount aspect) but also just the economics of it. Online marketplaces like Ebay, Amazon, and even the big box retailers using websites to fill orders and ship to either homes or for local pickup is the way the world is going. Just a few months ago, they shut down half of the Best Buy locations in the US because so many people are ordering online that they could keep making good revenue while eliminating the expense of having to staff so many stores (which gets into another side of the argument)

				Hmm the thought that they may have been preparing for this for a long time makes a lot of sense. It kind of surprised me that DPR with such a large pool of resources would have trouble getting the site up for more than a few days at a time.

				Thank you.<br />Anxiously hoping my vendor received my order before this latest attack.<br /><br />I&#039;m really wondering why DPR and SR are pretty certain this attack is an individual and not a new tactic by some form of government agency or some such thing...? I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been talked about here in one of the forums somewhere but I been reading and flippin about for about an hour now and I&#039;m getting sleepy so I thought I&#039;d just ask :-)<br /><br />&nbsp;I wish all the best to DPR, his Crew and everyone else in all their various circumstances. Peace to all.<br /><br />

				Yes, you are hurting the site more by constantly logging on/trying to logon.&nbsp; Each connection is another &quot;tie&quot; of the resources on the server(s).&nbsp; How much of a hurt are all the continuous &quot;tries&quot; taking up, that is tough to say (for us and probably SR admins as well) as its difficult to tell a &quot;real&quot; logon from the ddos open connection.&nbsp; Each open connection, whether real or attack ties up the server resources.&nbsp; <br /><br />The best action here is to wait, let them work this out, not pay the extortion fee, get the site back up running better and more resilient.<br /><br />We all want our orders.&nbsp; My partners and I want to take orders and ship product.&nbsp; But constant pounding the site with multiple logon attempts isn&#039;t helping.&nbsp; Its hurting.&nbsp;
