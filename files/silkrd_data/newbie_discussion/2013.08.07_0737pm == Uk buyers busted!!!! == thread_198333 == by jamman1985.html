				admin look into this: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/32842c5427<br /><br />on his homepage it says:<br /><br />&quot;Some orders that were marked as dispatched will be cancelled&quot; and then &quot;NB: Cancelling those sucked. So sorry, both to my repeat and new clients. &quot;<br /><br />we are all told vendors delete our information, how that possible when you marked the goods in transit. I am scared as fuck as i got kids and a wife staying with me.&nbsp; someone please help me to stop worrying and tell me i am wrong.&nbsp; his feedback is also looking fake as fuck as i am still waiting for my btc/item but no response.<br /><br />on the seller guide on wiki it says:<br /><br />&quot;You and you alone will have your client&#039;s shipping address. This information must be destroyed as soon as it is used to label their package. When you click &quot;confirm shipment,&quot; the address will be deleted forever and irretrievable. &quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />and then<br /><br />&quot;-Under no circumstance should you save a copy of your client&#039;s address.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Admin save us please, someone get back to me.&nbsp;

				Okay, I am sorry for the knee-jerk response. I still think link should have been included in OP<br /><br />but anyway, that does seem rather worrying. I have yet to procure anything illegal from SR, but I can only imagine how paranoid I&#039;ll be when I finally do

				Hi.<br /><br />Nothing on the BBC report mentions SR. Understand the panic but please don&#039;t report (or insinuate) things as an SR bust when there is no hard and concrete. I, like a lot of buyers, vendors, and forum members, check regularly, and it just puts the shits up for no reason.<br /><br />There have been NO substantiated busts that derived from SR activity alone. (Correct me if I am wrong, people.) Couple of things have happened where careless people have been involved in RL activities and had SR info on their computers, but as I say, NO SR activity has led directly to a bust.<br /><br />If we all use best practice, it won&#039;t. DPR was a clever chap the way he set up the site, hats off to you DPR. If there was an actual SR bust, it would be ALL OVER the news. LE would make sure of that. <br /><br />So calm down and have a.. (your pleasure here...).<br /><br />Take care.

				A lot of people use the mail to distribute drugs. Among bulk shipments, probably 99% have nothing to do with SR, and there was no mention of these people using a &quot;hidden&quot; web site or anything like that.

				On the other hand... I have just posted an article from The Daily Fail about a bust up in the UK of an ecstasy dealer specifically mentioning that he sells &#039;online&#039;.&nbsp; SR is not specifically mentioned.

				Maybe it might not mention SR, but surely the post is going to be a little more under scrutiny now???<br />I will agree because SR is not mentioned but only the investigating officers would know surely if it was in the loop. If not im sure they will be looking to see As this is a relatively&nbsp; big case, surely they will be doing some research into how they came into getting into this online business?<br />Just thought some people on here might like to know what went down....<br />All i know is 3 people from northern ireland got caught getting &#039;stuff&#039;&#039; sent through the post<br />
