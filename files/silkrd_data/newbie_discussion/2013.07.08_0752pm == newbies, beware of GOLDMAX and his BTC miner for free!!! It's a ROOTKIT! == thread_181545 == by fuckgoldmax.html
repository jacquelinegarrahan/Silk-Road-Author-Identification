				Fuck that son of a bitch! May he die in a fire! That piece of turd offered a ++ silent bitcoin miner 24 hour offer ++ free ! Yeah, sure thing bro! Turns out it&#039;s a rootkit. That shit goes undetected by your antivirus software, it will give up all passwords, all data you type and what you see to the hacker!<br />If you really want to play with fire, like I did (and I knew better, but I am back with a vengeance, you fucking cunt, I have YOUR IP address now, asshole! and I am going to make you pay) , just don&#039;t use common sense and be complacent:<br /><br />1. Accept a too-good-to-be-true gift from a perfect stranger with almost no history<br />2. Instead of running it on a burn-computer that is NOT connected to the net, just use it on the PC you use for your fun life (yeah, after all, a BTC miner needs an internet connection, no?)<br /><br />All is back to order now, and soon that low life is going to feel the heat.

				He&#039;s a cunt and was not careful enough, but I am not going to tell you how I got his IP. He&#039;s from the UK and he knows I know. Also Rootkits are very stealth and very hard to detect with regular antivirus software. Don&#039;t play with fire. Use a spare PC not connected to the net to open your files and start your programs.<br />Champagne for everyone!

				This vendor looks extremely suspicious from my pov, classic scam stucture.<br /><br />Cheap/free pills to build up rep,<br />once trust is achieved offer higher priced goods with no intention to fulfill.&nbsp; Has anyone received bud of them yet?<br /><br />What&#039;s majorly suspicious is the photos of the bud....some are out of focus done on a shit camera, some look professionally done with effects and background color....obviously not taken by the same person.<br /><br />Not saying they are scammers in the making but beware<br />

				Just had another look at their blurb....`update currently all mdma sold out hopefully will have a fresh batch in on the 31st july`&nbsp; &nbsp;`31st july 1kg of new blue mdma now in stock this mdma will blow you away if you liked the last batch you must try the blue all i can say is wow&#039;<br /><br />If you go through their old review items they havn&#039;t sold any mdma, only free mis-stamped pills.<br />Started selling other stuff aprox 5 days ago and apparently claims can take over a week to arrive.<br /><br />My advice: &nbsp;Do not order until arrival and reviews are coming up for their non-samples
