				What the title says, I have a regular checking account, and withdraw through dwolla. everything is legit. <br />nothing has raised flags, there is nothing illegal about buying bitcoins, and &quot;selling them&quot; for cash. <br /><br />the reason why i ask is i have read about people being talked to by the bank after certain ammounts... but i dont know.

				You&#039;d have to be acting AWFULLY suspicious and sketchy for them to bother you about $300 deposits ...

				I usually make deposits on the ATM, there are thousands around town, but i tend to only use 2, theres a third i seldom use, but there shouldn&#039;t be anything wrong with using other ones right? am I just being paranoid? <br /><br />and if someone asks, i can say that i am a student (true) and resell books i buy from other students (books go for $100s )

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a cumulative total but 10k is for sure the max amount you can deposit at once without them clearing it with IRS etc. I deposited ~14k clean money once and they only released 7.5k until a week later. Should&#039;ve seen the teller lady hitting on me when she read the amount. So personally I wouldn&#039;t go above 7.5k if I HAD to put in a lot at once. I&#039;m interested in specifics about this too. How much can you realistically have in your account before they get suspicious? If you place in a lot in small increments but pay taxes for it will they leave you alone?

				Banks don&#039;t become suspicious, the only hotline they have is for robberies.&nbsp; The metrics you produce by specific banking habits could trigger flags for further investigation.&nbsp; At 300 *4 times per week * 52 weeks in a year I don&#039;t think you&#039;re financially significant.&nbsp; Congratulations or apologies

				Why are you depositing cash to the bank? You can still use cash to buy stuff. Put your cash in a floor safe or your freezer or something. Its much safer there than the bank

				You are being extremely paranoid;-)&nbsp; Unless you reside in a small town in which the tellers would gossip about your bank activity, I believe you are good.&nbsp;

				If you&#039;re really nervous about it, and dont live in a small town, gradually bring up your &quot;side job&quot;.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a nerdier looking fellow, mention coding. If you&#039;re a normal joe, mention handyman work or painting or whatever. <br /><br />That amount of money is only suspicious if you make it suspicious.

				I think I read here that 10k is the max deposit before it gets flagged for some more eyes. Most say 8.5k is the most you should put in at a time to stay a bit clear of that 10k<br /><br />I&#039;ve done deposits up to 2k when bitfloor was still here

				okay so depositing 10K at one time will flag the system but is there a cumulative total which can also flag it. like if you deposit 1K/day everyday thats 365K a year which seems to me would raise a flag.

				Everybody has side gigs nowadays. Maybe you buy stuff at garage sales and sell it on Craigslist, or mow lawns or paint houses or babysit.&nbsp; Or maybe your mom gives you cash every week.&nbsp; The bank doesn&#039;t care.
