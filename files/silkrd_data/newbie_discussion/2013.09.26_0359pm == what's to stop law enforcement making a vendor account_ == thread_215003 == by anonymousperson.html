				LE can send me all the drugs the want... no evidence will be left&nbsp; :) <br /><br />How does LE know that the person ordering is the person at that address?&nbsp; The same protections remain as with a normal vendor.&nbsp; Anyone can send you a package.<br /><br />moneyisthereason...

				I am most sure LE has tried that approach at some time. That is why there is a feedback system but do not trust that alone. You need to read the forums as well to verify in case of false reviews.<br /><br />But the thought does cross my mind every time I see a new vendor with no stats and/or offering great too good to be true first time deals.<br /><br />It amazes me that anyone could ever get started in the vendor business. I would never buy from someone with zero stats though I am glad that someone has the balls to make a first purchase with a new vendor not knowing if they are&nbsp; scam, LE or what have you.<br />

				i&#039;ve reviewed a few samples for new vendors on here and every time i wonder if its just pigs trying to get our addies. might have to put a stop to doing that i think. so far every time a sample has turned up tho.

				Think of the size/scope of that investigation. We&#039;re talking different countries, states, GOVERNMENTS, all with different laws regarding things like warrants, probable cause and entrapment....etc, etc, etc.&nbsp; Seems to me it would be a HUGE undertaking to fish for a bunch of little guys buying , what, a 1/4 of weed??? 3 heroin stamps or a xanax?? <br />The LEO&#039;s have budgets, they have to allocate funds and get some kinda bang for their buck when paying fotr these investigations. <br />I would think that they would concentrate their efforts, funds and resources on trying to bring the whole Road down, soimehow,&nbsp; &nbsp;DPR and/or the big vendors. <br /><br />I HOPE I&#039;m at least sorta right.

				It would be a lot of effort just for possession charges. Having said that, in some jurisdictions it&#039;s not entrapment if LE gets you to do something you were clearly going to do anyway. That means they could sell you a large amount of drugs and then bust you as you sell them on.<br /><br />I think LE are more concerned about possession with intent to supply. Like I said, it&#039;s not worth spending resources on simple possession charges. That&#039;s the great thing about the road tho; even when I buy large amounts of drugs it&#039;s never to pass them on. I&#039;ve taken to just telling other people how to use the road and recommending vendors, so they can buy their own drugs! :)

				We are a new vendor with no stats yet a whole bunch of people have ordered with us. <br />Like some of the reasons listed above it doesn&#039;t really matter if LE send you stuff, they can&#039;t prove it was you who ordered it IF YOU PRACTICE GOOD SECURITY.<br /><br />Always encrypt your address. Use Tails if at all possible. Don&#039;t keep records of transactions. Don&#039;t use your own internet connection. There are lots of ways to protect yourself. At the end of the day LE are looking for sources and dealers not users. You are gonna be fine. And while you are at it take a look at our promotional sale :P <br /><br />Its in the link below.<br /><br />Cheers!

				A good vendor sends out samples when they start up.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t see several reviews from established buyers for illegal material then don&#039;t buy from them.<br /><br />Cops are not going to send real drugs to strangers, possibly children. It would be a shitstorm if they got caught.<br /><br />The real danger is them compromising an existing vendor&#039;s account by forcing them to give up the password.<br /><br />Really though, busting drug buyers is not their priority. If they thought the buyer knew who the vendor was perhaps, but they know the buyer does not know.

				They can but it will only be useful for them to bust people buying relatively large quantities of contraband. In addition, they can compromise a vendor and use his account to make controlled buys.<br /><br />Pure address collection is generally worthless. Do they really need the list of addresses (which may not even be home addresses) of a bunch of drug addicts?
