				The &quot;official&quot; reason is that DPR and the admins decided to implement this policy in order to give us a better change to combat the &quot;virwex&quot; &quot;btkoin&quot; &quot;mtgix&quot; &quot;bitcointalks&quot; bitcoin spam which was causing a lot of users to lose money.&nbsp; This way, we are able to notice, identify, and delete the accounts before they are able to flood the rest of the forums and scam more people.
