				So i have been on and off with having bad sleeping patterns, not by choice, and was wondering if anyone else with a smiler experience could give me a recommendation. I am relatively active and somewhat healthy, 135lbs male, nothing particularly extraordinary or unhealthy. Yet i find myself unable to sleep, and if i do find it, it is elusive and short lived. Marijuana was my go to gal but being required to take THC tests is forcing me to search for an alternative. Anyone else have smiler experience or an idea as to help me reach sleep. Prescription sleep aids are not currently an option, long story. I have been taking melatonin 3mg x 2 pills regularly with absolutely zero effect, also have been considering Dioscorea Dregeana - Wild Yam: Mega Sedative <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/fde4cb2ecb<br /><br />Lemme know what you guys got, please share in depth if willing/possible to help relate to my situation. Also if you have tried the Wild Yam feel free to chip in on that, am interested even if it isnt a realistic option for consistent sleep.

				Have you tried wanking?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Seriously, though, as far as legit sleep aids go, valerian can be quite good, although you may have to take quite a lot, and it helps if you combine it with exercise - take a couple of caps, go for a walk/jog and when you get home you should be knackered enough to pass out.<br /><br />

				If you need to sleep there are many over the counter sleep aids that can help but they really arent good for the long term.&nbsp; <br /><br />As someone with a long history of insomnia my advise is to go to the gym, start running, just basically exhaust yourself completely and you&#039;ll fall asleep.&nbsp; Also your diet may be playing a factor, if you eat to much or badly your body may not be able to shut down as its still trying to break down your days meals.<br /><br />Once you get into a routine you&#039;ll train your body to sleep at the right time.

				Chronic Insomniac here. I personally would recommend some kind of meds but my non med approach is 20mg of Melatonin, Valerian Root, and this product called &quot; 4 Sleep and Relaxation&quot;.
