				Im not a verteran, but have been paying close close attention to the SR. Ive come across sellers that take down ALL of their listings (some have as many as.. 30? idk) when they are out of town or backed up on orders. In addition to that, you have to imagine how many different listings there are for one product, but larger and smaller ammounts. So if one item is gone from a seller, they take down ALL of the seperate listings, witch COULD include 5 other listing.<br /><br />Other than those reasons, id also like to know. Not sure my explenation would make sense to go from 5000 items to 350.

				I&#039;d bet a few BTC&#039;s (not) that its because you have sometimes got the domestic filter on. When I don&#039;t have it on its around 5000 and when its on its in the 300s.

				some things are seasonal like wild picked magic mushrooms, like psilocybe cyanescens, which I hope to make available someday. the way to get around that is vacuum pack in glass jars, otherwise many species of wild psilocybe are seasonal and start to go down in potency after a few months<br /><br />it depends if people can pick a years supply in a season and then store it properly....the grown kind, psilocybe cubensis, can be grown at any time...most of the better wild ones can&#039;t, at least not practically

				Cyanspore beat me to this one.. The Magical Mushroom is the product that I&#039;ve seen with so many new vendors who are gone within 2 weeks because of dried up supply. A lot of these growers can&#039;t keep up with the insane demand that exists for shrooms. Now we see some larger distributors around.. But sooner or later they&#039;ll dry up too. I love looking at supply and demand trends on here, as I&#039;ve always liked the practical nature of microeconomics (and macro, although it seems that the drug microeconomy doesn&#039;t correlate too strongly to the overall macroeconomy. People want their drugs and they&#039;ll pay what they don&#039;t have).
