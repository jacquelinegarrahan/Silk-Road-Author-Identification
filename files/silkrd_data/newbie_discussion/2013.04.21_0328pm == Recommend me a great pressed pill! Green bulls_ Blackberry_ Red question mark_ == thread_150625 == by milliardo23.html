Id say 7/10 pressed pills these days are hardly MDMA, if at all. Though, real MDMA pressies do still float around, and yes.. when its legit, its as good as it was 15 yrs ago.

Today I received my 10 pack from kwikEmart. I will be trying them this Friday. I&#039;ve read on other threads that they are great. I also received Orange Triforce from Clearance which are sourced from SuperTrips. They&#039;re supposed to have 150mg of MDMA with 60mg of amphetamine. I know those will definitely keep me up all night! <br /><br />Anyone try the skulls or thumbs?

				Orange Triforces with the MDMA/Amp are a all night type of pill. Just don&#039;t go crazy with them.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for straight MDMA I&#039;d honestly just buy crystal from someone. A ton cheaper and FIRE if you source correctly.<br /><br />I&#039;d run with either partyflocks or the new purple lambos/nintendos (same presser, same big ass dose of MDMA) if you&#039;re DEAD SET on buying a pressed pill tho.

				Just joined the SilkRoad and I haven&#039;t yet made a purchase but I definitely want to get some MDMA pills via the SR but I&#039;m having trouble finding vendors outside the us that will even ship to the states. Have I not searched the market well enough? <br /><br />Or are these vendors simply exempting the USA for online security reasons while still accepting orders from the us?&nbsp; <br /><br />Ultimately, can anyone recommend a reliable vendor within the states for MDMA or from another country who is willing to (discreetly) ship illegals??
