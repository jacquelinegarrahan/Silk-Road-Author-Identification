				I live where weed is 100% legal, I will never be busted for having marijuana on me. I have been shipping to friends around the country for a while, but thought I&#039;d make a silk road account to expand my customer base... More customers = more profit, right? But man with all this FE and PGP... Is it worth it? Do I really need to use this PGP stuff? It&#039;s fucking marijuana, it&#039;s not like I&#039;m sending people crates of heroin. Are my customers going to agree or will they feel I&#039;m putting them at risk/ refuse to buy from me? Like I said I&#039;ve been dealing weed for awhile but I&#039;m a COMPLETE newb at this Silk Road stuff, so any suggestions appreciated.. or if anyone can help me gauge whether I&#039;m way off, I&#039;d appreciate it.

If you&#039;re going to do this you should at least support PGP, and you should make sure that your packaging is up to standard (vac seal + MBB would be a really good start).

				Hey, thanks for the advice! I do vacuum seal but I&#039;ll look into MBB, I don&#039;t know what that is. So I need to support PGP but not require it...? I really do appreciate you taking the time to answer my newb questions :)

				Just cause pot is legal doesn&#039;t mean you wont get in trouble for distributing a federally illegal substance across border.<br /><br />PGP is simple and quick. Not much of a hassle and better to be safe than sorry when you&#039;re selling drugs.

				Hey, hope you get a good start with your business. I can&#039;t offer any advice but on PGP: as a buyer, I wouldn&#039;t buy from someone who doesn&#039;t offer it, just to keep my mind safe.

				I agree with the rest of the posts on here. Def use PGP. It is there so the buyer can encrypt their address. I am sure you wouldn&#039;t want to give your address in plain text to a complete stranger. Who knows if they get raided and your address is on&nbsp; the computer. Then it is bad news for everyone.<br /><br />Use PGP and for the more noobish customers I would offer Privnote. Privnote is however 3rd party, so I wouldn&#039;t put all of my trust in something like that. Again, PGP is mainly there for the BUYERS protection. Do good business and do everything you can to protect your customers, that is if you plan on keeping them as customers...

				In a way its worth it just&nbsp; on the principle of having your transactions&nbsp; kept private, as inconvenient or paranoid as it may seem.<br /><br />Also realize that , while weed may be legal where you&#039;re at: you are sending packages over state lines using federal carriers. And that can be a whole shit ton of trouble with even longer incarcerations if your not careful. .

				it will give your customers a higher degree of security i believe. I had never used pgp before learning about the road, and it didnt take me long to learn.

				PGP is so damn easy to learn. Why skip a step to keep your identity that much more anonymous and secure? I&#039;m sure there will be people that would be willing to deal with you without PGP, but they are few and far between. <br /><br />Yes, weed is legal around you, but I&#039;m assuming some of the places you will be shipping to, weed isn&#039;t exactly so legal. Safety and anonymity should be your top priorities when doing business on SR. Over-confidence should not get in the way of that. It&#039;s also reflective of your professionalism. SR isn&#039;t just shipping between &quot;friends&quot;, it&#039;s a business in which both the buyer and seller take risks, and your buyers identities shouldn&#039;t be compromised because you want to take the easy route.
