				Interesting... sativa dominant strains are often rich in CBDs and good for anxiety. Do you get the same effect from indica dominate weed?

				I had this problem too for awhile. I had panic and anxiety attacks from marijuana use for a couple of years. The only thing that helped was taking a long break from the weed for awhile. Also be aware of when and why the panic or anxiety comes on, there could be things you are not facing/dealing with in life which is creating anxiety. But my best advice is to take a break for awhile at least or cut way down on your consumption. Also like has been said, a nice indica dominant plant shouldnt have the same negative effects. Remember sativa is more of a head high, and indica is more of a body high. Good luck and all the best.

				Hey first of all I&#039;m sorry to hear you&#039;re going through these panic attacks while trying to enjoy some bud.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a lot of first hand experience (and especially more recently) with smoking and panic attacks.&nbsp; I smoked a lot of weed for years, but never had panic attacks or any adverse effects while smoking.&nbsp; <br /><br />Recently my circumstances changed from where I was smoking with good friends or by myself in my apartment in California to having to move back in with my rents in PA after getting laid off.&nbsp; Now when I smoke I am having to do it at a friends apartment and they smoke cigs (I don&#039;t smoke them) and I found that this def. increases my anxiety (just the 2nd hand smoke in their small apartment).&nbsp; I also began (and since stopped) using Xanax and Valium to get to sleep.&nbsp; That stuff will cause panic attacks when you are getting off of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I guess my point is try to analyze your situation and figure out why you are getting the panic attacks.&nbsp; It probably doesn&#039;t have as much to do with the weed as it does with your circumstances, surroundings when you smoke, and other drugs/substances you are exposed to.&nbsp; Get yourself in a good place where you are comfortable and happy and you should be better off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck!

				super strong sativas i think do this way more often than indicas.. bcbud mentioned it shouldn&#039;t, but from experience it&#039;s always the super strong sativas that get my heart going and a little antsy/nervous.<br /><br />grab some indica, when u smoke the sativa just start with a little bit, give the high a few minutes, then go from there

				I am exactly the same. I hate it but I am starting getting control of it. <br /><br />The best thing to do is remember that it&#039;s all in your head. Even if you do have a crazy fast heart rate, don&#039;t panic. If you have a heart attack and die that&#039;s just what was meant to happen. Accepting death as part of life really does help a great deal with anxiety and panic disorders. <br /><br />Sounds weird and stupid but it works.

				Sometimes you just need to relax yourself to avoid these attacks.&nbsp; I think the more experienced you are with sativas the less it will happen.<br /><br />Of course you can always find the strains that have both great sativa and indica qualities, so you can get the flying high feeling without feeling tense.<br /><br />Earl

				Indica has a body-stone feel to it, Sativa is more of a cerebral high.<br />You could try a strain that is a hybrid of the two? Or switch to pure Indica.<br /><br />If it&#039;s giving you panic attacks, probably best to try something else.

				I&#039;m a naturally anxious and paranoid person so this is particularly bad for me. I think setting is important. If I am worried about anything then it will be bad, and one of the things that often worries me when smoking weed is fear of people smelling it or getting in trouble, and this means I can&#039;t relax.<br /><br />I think weed enhances things you are already feeling. When I am in an extremely good mood, relaxed, have no commitments to worry about, nothing to get up for the next day, and know I&#039;m not in any kind of danger, I have a really good time. But more often than not, I am anxious, nervous, fearful, and weed makes these feelings worse and if I smoke too much I get paranoid and worry about people looking at me or think my heart is beating too fast and even think songs are talking directly to me in a threatening way.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame because I have had some great times with weed but perhaps it&#039;s not for everyone. If I do smoke any I have to smoke less and only do it when the mood is right for me.
