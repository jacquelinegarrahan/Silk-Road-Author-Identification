				I&#039;m planning on attending Ultra in Miami in March. I have purchased my plane ticket, etc. Problem is, I don&#039;t know how to bring the drugs I want. I&#039;m wanting to trip the first day on lsd, roll the second day, and maybe roll the third. No weed, or anything. My question is, how can I get it there? I&nbsp; would not feel comfortable putting it in luggage or carry on. Cops/security scare me. I don&#039;t have anyone to mail it to in the area, sadly. And the motel we&#039;re staying at, is a little rinky dink place. I would not trust mailing/picking up a package from them.<br />So that only leaves the option of transporting it in my body. I would NOT feel comfortable swallowing it in some kind of bag or condom. <br />What I have considered though is vacuum sealing it, putting it in a condom, or two, or three, (all inside one another) tying them, and stuff it up my ass. I know that doesn&#039;t sound very comforting, but I can&#039;t think of any other way. It&#039;d only have to be enough mdma and lsd for me and one buddy. so under a gram of molly, and a few blotters of acid. <br />Any advice / personal stories?<br /><br />Any guidance would be appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks

				Dude, just pack that stuff in your luggage. Put it in the pocket of a pair of pants at the bottom of your bag, on maybe in the crotch/fly/flap thingie of a pair of boxers or something. Nobody&#039;s going to check your shit, and even if they do, I doubt they&#039;re going to unroll every pair of boxers and go through every pair of jeans in your checked bag. Paranoid is healthy, for sure, but you&#039;ve got to be reasonable. The odds of a dog trained to sniff out molly getting wind of your bag are slim, and of one that could detect LSD are astronomical.<br /><br />Source: I semi-regularly transport various psychedelics and occasionally even hash on planes, never had a problem.

				Dude.&nbsp; Do not stick it up your ass.&nbsp; I do not know for sure, but those full-body scanners might pick up something.<br /><br />I take about 20 trips by plane per year for work, and can say that security is not as big of a deal as most people think.<br /><br />I would take hwallclimber&#039;s advice and just put it in your luggage - personally I&#039;d probably go for your CARRY-ON, the reason being: when they search your checked luggage by hand, they leave a little paper note in it saying that they&#039;ve done so.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten this paper note dozens of times, meaning that they often check checked luggage personally.&nbsp; However, I have maybe one time gotten my carry-on checked by hand - it usually just passes through the conveyor-belt piece of cake.<br /><br />LSD should be super easy to bring - put it in a pack of gum and put the pack of gum in a tray with your wallet and keys when you put it through the conveyor belt.&nbsp; The molly, I&#039;m not so sure about - any suggestions anyone?

				The thing with putting it something like a pack of gum though is that the xray machines detect different densities. A random square in a pack of gum would look suspicious. <br /><br />For example<br />http://snallabolaget.com/images/xray.jpg<br />http://aviationhumor.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/airport_scan.jpg<br /><br /><br />

				Unless you have the worlds thickest blotter paper, it&#039;s not going to show up on an xray. You could try putting the blotters in a book if you want, or stash them in a bookmark.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going to be this paranoid, here&#039;s the method I plan on using to take a shitload of acid with me the next time I head to Tokyo:<br />1. Get a couple pieces of paper to make a nice bookmark, probably out of a couple of those prayer cards you get at some funerals<br />2. Put single layer of blotters (probably sandwiched between rice rolling papers, just in case) in between the 2 layers of bookmark<br />3. Laminate that bad boy and put one of those nice little tassels on there<br /><br />And just some food for thought: If you&#039;re this worked up about the issue now, you&#039;re probably going to be nervous as shit going through security, and that, my friend, will set off more red flags than anything. Take precautions, sure, but once you commit to this, I highly suggest you relax and let it run its course; if they catch you for some reason, just be calm, be honest (they&#039;ve already caught you with the shit, no sense in lying about it) and tell them that it&#039;s all for personal use, apologize, and ask them if they could just throw it all away and send you on your way.

				For the molly:<br /><br />get a bottle of vitamin capsules to keep in your hand luggage<br />replace 2 or 3 of the contents of capsules with the molly<br />put back in vitamin container<br />take it in with your hand luggage<br /><br />They are not going to sit and empty every single one of your vitamin capsules, i can guarantee that. <br /><br />as for the lsd, the other guys had pretty good ideas&nbsp; ;D

				My advise is......<br />1. A friend told me he met someone at Camp Bisco (3 day overnight music festival) who got a bar of soap, sliced it in half and carved out some of the middle, he then filled it up with his drugs and with some water sealed the bar of soap back up.&nbsp; Said it worked PERFECTLY.&nbsp; Now i told a friend of mine and he said that the xray can see right through the bar of soap... so i would do some research on this.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; If you have luggage with the metal handles that pull up and down, you can detach the top part and stuff your drugs in the hallow poles, this is how someone i met would smuggle a shit ton of cocaine into the US from Columbia.<br /><br />There are two options, neither of which i have tried but i have heard of others doing.&nbsp; Good luck getting to Ultra!&nbsp; Ill be there with a lot of goods hopefully cuz im driving down there =)

				Two things to considers:<br /><br />1: If the festival is high profile enough the break room that the TSA guys sit in has a poster in it telling them that drugs are likely this week. It will be raised at security team meetings also.<br /><br />This is not so likely, but if it is they&#039;ll definitely have the dogs working and your state of arrival (one known for organized distro) will be a key factor in the level of scrutiny faced. <br /><br />2: Getting caught is getting caught. <br /><br />The difference between getting scanned at the gates in an airport and being cuffed at a local bar is that the airport guys are more serious - if/when you end up in court its the same charge so its not really a big difference when or where it happens. <br />Dont be a patsy and carry for other people, carry your own risk and BE ZEN AS FUCK because half the reasons they insist on long lines is to check body language. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve accidentally carried multiple grams of stuff across state lines (not even hidden, just inside a shoe in my checked luggage) but if you get searched then you&#039;re in trouble. Signs of concealment are actually easier to find than drugs. Hide in plain site - scrunch shit up and have it sitting at the bottom of your carry on, people have mess and junk all the time. have some M&amp;M&#039;s and other shit down there too and drop in the pills. <br /><br />Its very easy to see a concealment when you have multiple scanners (shallow and deep, and contrasts - they switch between) but messy shit looks like messy shit and your working as a TSA agent for 8 hours a day 5 days a week you&#039;d get over it pretty fast. <br /><br />My only other advice is if you want to keyster it practice jamming some things up there and walking around at home. It will be a hella uncomfortable flight when really you just gotta walk past a xray scanner to get away scott free.

				practice makes perfect, if you want to keyster it, I&#039;d go to a gay bar, pick up some dudes, preferably the ones who identify as a &quot;top&quot;, and let him practice on your bottom.&nbsp; You think I&#039;m kidding, but I am man enough to admit I&#039;d rather some guy that *I* pick to poke my keyster than a random inmate or convict who the government selects as your bunkmate, and he will probably not be as good-looking or smell as nice as you&#039;d like.&nbsp; Pick someone who you can lay with your nose under his armpit.&nbsp; Nowadays, being gay is the new black, so stop your whining.&nbsp; Start with a plastic dildo, preferably a vibrating one, and work your way up to a dick.&nbsp; Make sure you both wear condoms, and always use lube, and lots of it.&nbsp; From my own personal experience, make sure to have towels around because there&#039;s going to be more than one wet spot, and if it&#039;s your first time and you are too nervous to buy douche or too macho to go through with the process of cleaning your asshole beforehand, the idea is you don&#039;t want your first time to be a total disaster, girl!&nbsp; Be safe out there everyone.

				if these scanners are the same ones they have in europe then they don&#039;t xray your body and cant see anything past your skin, only through clothes. you could stick it between your bum cheeks without full on ramming it up there. i did that before getting on the eurostar as i was baked, running late and could only find one of those passport photo booths. do they really make you go through body scanners for domestic flights?! if you say you&#039;re pregnant you can get away with a pat down. that won&#039;t work for everyone.. switching out vitamin caps is a good suggestion. with acid the possibilities are endless. a lot of people take a book to read on the flight.
