				Has anyone any ideas?<br /><br />Last night something happened to my account on SR and i can no longer access it. Just keeps saying &#039;log in failed, please try again&#039;. I&#039;m still able to log on here at the forum, but not at SR???<br />I&#039;ve have sent a message to SR support from a new account i had to set up in order to contact them but i&#039;m still waiting for a response and i&#039;m getting really worried as i&#039;ve bitcoins in my account and a couple of orders placed. I don&#039;t know whats happened and i definitely didn&#039;t give my details to anyone. <br />I&#039;m going to change my password now here on the forum just in case something happens to this too. Some one please tell me that SR support will be able to do a pass phrase reset for me or something???<br /><br />Panic stations!

				Have you signed up to Atlantis lately using the same login details?<br /><br />Support team should contact you soon and will ask you some security questions and change your password for you. As long as the phishers don&#039;t have you pin pass-phrase your coins should still be in there.

				I did the exact same thing, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s Atlantis doing it but there is a .onion link going around on here and in sellers feedback that looks very similar to the original one and it&#039;s set up to store your login/sign-up details. <br /><br />I setup a new SR account and contacted the SR team with it telling them what happened, they asked for details regarding the phished account and sent me a new password. The annoying thing is they lock your account for 72hrs for security reasons so you can&#039;t buy anything.

				Yeah i found the link to it in one of the vendors feedback.<br /><br />I feel like such a dick now, if its not broken don&#039;t fix it,&nbsp; and I&#039;m 100% happy with SR, it was just i was curious to have a look, you know.<br /><br />Please god they will be able to sort it out for me too! i certainly don&#039;t mind the 72 hour freeze once they can hook me back up....<br /><br />Thanks for your reply mate, you&#039;ve put my mind at ease a little, thank you!<br />

				Harsh, sorry to hear you got phished! Lucky you didn&#039;t use the same pin :) SR Support are always busy, sometimes really busy unfortunately. You&#039;ll usually hear from them within 24 hrs depending, but you will hear from them, AB.
