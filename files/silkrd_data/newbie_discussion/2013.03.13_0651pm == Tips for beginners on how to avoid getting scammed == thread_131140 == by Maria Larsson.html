				Since I just got reminded that I&#039;m still a newbie while trying to make a reply on this subject in another thread I decided to start this topic. By trying to prevent the most vulnerable users, beginners, from getting ripped off we also reduce the scammers profits (which they invest in bigger smarter scams) and give more space to fair trading and win-win deals. I believe I have some knowledge in this matter since I have been fascinated about fraud culture and hanging around forums about carding, hacking, black hat money making etc for 10+ years now and observed scams of all sorts going down including schemes from people feeding their family or just getting stinking rich from fraud.<br /><br />1) Don&#039;t FE. Even if you dont care about loosing your cash, everybody else are doing it, you feel bad for honest hard working sellers having to wait for their profits or go in the biggest newbie trap there is, thinking something like &quot;but this guy really seem nice and honest, not like some evil scammer&quot;. By FEing you are KILLING SILK ROAD encouraging scammers to invest more and work harder here by showing them how easy people take risks with their money. You also encourage the normality of FEing which makes others fall in the trap, so even if YOU dont get scammed FEing others will because of you. Build your stats with patience and ignore those who don&#039;t think your stats are enough and you will soon be greatly rewarded by the opportunities of good deals.<br /><br />2) NEVER TRUST ANYONE, ESPECIALLY NOT YOUR FRIENDS. I called it the biggest newbie trap because making people think they know you and your personality makes them trust you, then you can take their money. At the carding/hacking forums I have many times witnessed the most friendly, sharing and helpful members (including hard working moderators and admins ofc) giving green light and verifying sales offers that turned into the biggest scams. Most people see this at once, but there is a great potential value in being one (and especially in being many) of the reputable helpful members sharing their thaughts and knowledge in the review threads. So many people, including myself, choose who we buy from because of the discussions in the review threads. Paying a bunch of people to manage a bunch of &quot;active reviewers&quot; would have such a impact on where ppl do their business that it would make great profit to a fraudster. Social Engineering is something most ppl can study, learn, and use for exploiting other ppls trust. You don&#039;t have to be a born psycopath wierdo without emotions to make someone believe you are their friend so you can steal from them. Humans are experts in justifying their own behaviour. <br /><br />3) Just play with the numbers and imagine how much profit the scammers can make with investing in &quot;fake members&quot; aka sock puppets building great reputation, or selling cheaper with less profit margin than honest members but then practice selective scamming and just take 100% profit in 1 of 10 deals, or 1 of 20, or maybe just sending out all the smaller amounts but letting some of the ones putting in bigger orders be &quot;unlucky&quot; with disappeared deliveries. Imagining the potential value of gaining reputation and trust have helped me greatly in not becoming one of those asking them selves &quot;why would someone put so much work and money into stealing from me when they could profit so much on fair deals?&quot;.<br /><br />4) Dont think about scammers as wierd evil masterminds who enjoy hurting others. Think of them as people who them selves probably have been scammed and fucked over so hard in life that they lost all hope in the human race. How bad would you feel about scamming some spoiled teenager on the other side of the planet while living under death threats and being robbed, extorted and blackmailed yourself? Thinking like this have helped me never getting suprised in how creative scammers can be, how hard they can work, and how far they can go (like breaking the &quot;no snitching&quot;-rule not uncommon among criminals and call the cops on your address and fuck your life over a few dollars).<br /><br />Please share your tips to support win-win trading and make scamming less easy and profitable. Feel free to question me if I was too high writing this not making enough sense. Stay safe.

				I don&#039;t think that FE is inherently a vulnerability, you just have to look carefully at who you FE with. If it&#039;s a vendor that&#039;s been on the road for a year, has hundreds of transactions, and clearly moves large numbers of bitcoins, they probably don&#039;t have the time/desire to scam you out of your .50 BTC order. If it&#039;s a new vendor and you FE on 100 BTC worth of merchandise, you are a fool. Never trust an order large enough to be worth the scam in FE. The only way small order are economical are with FE though, otherwise such small change wouldn&#039;t be worth the time/effort. At least that&#039;s my two cents.<br /><br />I&#039;ll add another: be patient and communicative! Sometimes vendors get ill or have security problems. It&#039;s better that you get your package 3 days late than not at all. Have patience and expect that the package will arrive if the seller says that it will arrive (at least up until the time when the package hasn&#039;t arrived).<br /><br />Be very careful trying to buy bitcoins off of the road. I&#039;ve never tried it, but I hear that there are a few legit vendors who offer their bitcoins, but there are also a lot of scammers. Just go through the work to get your bitcoins relatively reliably.

But I dont think you can look carefully enough to FE on silk road. In the end most ppl dont know shit about the one they are FEing to, except what the seller/other anonymous ppl let them &quot;know&quot; (think), which ofcourse can be just bullshit and lies. I agree that one should be patient (most important) and communicative (while aware that everything the one in the other end tells you can be lies). Even if its your own brother selling I wouldn&#039;t recommend FE:ing&nbsp; because it makes newbies think its normal to FE and it shows scammers people are prepared to FE and therefore hurt the community by encouraging scammers stealing business from fair sellers.<br /><br />And I dont agree on trusting even the the top long time vendors with FE, partly because reasons stated above. And partly because you dont have to be here for a long time to see that the biggest frauds are coming from the trusted top that also makes the most fair deals. I think its quite obvious that some of the top vendors build their reputation with flawless business for some time until they run out of stock, feel like taking a vacation, or just get overloaded with work, or maybe need some rehab time or just for the lulz scam everyone (including trusted customers which have given them alot good business) for a quick profit (even tho expanding fair business might seem more profitable and reasonable). Maybe they just get uncomfortable with all the attention? I know I would with that huge cash and drug flow. Then they lay low for a while and appear under new identity. Some dont even bother to look very different when they reappear and they know their old customers will recognize them and return for a couple of months of good trading again.<br /><br />Many of the old top vendors also easily gets away with &quot;selective scamming&quot; because they are targeted by so much blackmail from others fighting for the top listings that you cant tell if accusations of orders not being sent are true or blackmail. Many are also guilty of being human and committing unintentional selective scams when the guy handling their deliveries fuck up or starts stealing, or they get robbed, or have their storage raided by cops or something like that. Even tho there&#039;s a obvious period of bad biz/ppl not reciving orders they just ignore acknowledging the fuckup or call it &quot;logistical problems&quot; and keep on doing their thing without compensating customers (they probably feel risking their freedom is doing enough for the community so they dont want to compensate ppl from their own pocket for unexpected problems like police raids etc).<br /><br />I know it can seem like harsh accusations without evidence but I think everyone can come to this conclusion by studying old scams. They get forgotten suprisingly quickly. Being observant and patient and looking at how old scams are done is the best way to protect yourself. The things I mentioned are very hard to prove or avoid and will probably always keep happening. Every once in a while some (dont have to be fools, can be well educated ppl aswell) fall for the very old and simple Nigeria letter 411-scam because its a part of human nature wanting to feel trust, hope and compassion.<br />

				I don&#039;t advise anyone FE if they can avoid it. But in my case, I couldn&#039;t avoid it (or it was the lesser of two evils), so I picked trusted vendors and ordered small amounts. Even if they turn around and scam me and I get no refund at all, I can handle losing a bitcoin. Even if 50% of the orders I make turn scammed, I&#039;d still be getting better prices than I would on the street. Don&#039;t FE if you can avoid it, but if you can&#039;t just FE small amounts with trusted vendors.

				Maria this is very solid info for newbies and regular users.&nbsp; Thanks for putting in the time.<br /><br />I think for most, it is easy to be very strict about no FE ever but then from time to time you find yourself in a situation when it &#039;makes sense&#039;.&nbsp; Personally, I have avoided it thus far.&nbsp; The only tricky part is to find a solid vendor for a small initial order or three to build up your buyer stats without being asked to FE.&nbsp; <br /><br />I definitely understand why vendors request FE from a buyer with no stats making a $500 order. <br /><br />So just start small and try a few different products from a few different vendors.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also always put a human-style note before your address when you order (address PGP of course).&nbsp; I think this goes a long way from new buyers.<br /><br />And that reminds me:&nbsp; NEVER buy from a vendor who doesn&#039;t use PGP!!&nbsp; This is way more important than the FE issue, which is very important.<br /><br />And:&nbsp; make sure you return the favor by finalizing ASAP when you get satisfactory product.&nbsp; I truly think that much of the FE requests arise because so many buyers sit around on their high ass for a day or two before giving up the money after they get their drugs.&nbsp; Finalizing promptly is very important for a healthy SR economy.&nbsp; Don&#039;t bite the hand that stones you!<br /><br />

				I FE&#039;d my first 2 purchases on the road.<br /><br />I only did it with small orders and also the vendors had 100% reviews.<br /><br />I received one order VERY quickly.&nbsp; I&#039;m still waiting for another order, started to get worried about this one though.<br /><br />It was only 70 USD though.

				Thanks for the tips :) So is it beneficial to make a few purchases and get buyer rating up before trying to sell anything? Or if you got a lot of stuff to get rid of, should you (and can you) just start selling?

				I can respect threads like this because I spent about a month learning how to function as best as possible thru the main site and the forums. I really had no interest in signing up here until a vendor (Cimicon) wanted to dick me around. Dealing with him I&#039;ve learned my lesson about dealing with people who don&#039;t have a policy regarding re-ships/refunds/package interceptions.

				I found this paper when I was new to the forum: http://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm<br /><br />Very useful and informative to understand how groups with different interests can use social engineering methods for their own benefit in forums and communities. Can be applied very well on a vendor planning a big scam wanting to gain trust and make ppl see them as their friends. Should be something every new member must read imo, but too bad its not a super easy read for many...<br /><br />The main lesson is:<br />Don&#039;t let emotions in a place like this built to work on logic. Leave trust, friendship, loyalty etc somewhere else and use logic here. Dont get confused thinking you can trust people just because they seem like helpful and nice people.

				Just an update.&nbsp; I sent an email to THERX and he replied with a very lengthy email.&nbsp; He put my worries to bed for the time being.<br /><br />Just as a note, if the vendor has 100% ratings and is domestic, as long as you feel comfortable and aren&#039;t paying for a shit ton of product.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see the big problem with FEing. <br /><br />Buy what you are prepared to lose when FEing.&nbsp; You never know what can happen.

				I&#039;ve been in this wonderful place since probably 2011. I don&#039;t remember. <br /><br />I am glad that Maria took the time out of her day to write this guide, but I want to simplify it for everyone. <br /><br />Have you ever thrown your wallet into a moving garbage truck just for the kick of it? NO? Then don&#039;t FE YOU DUMB SHITS. <br /><br />Maybe you are the gambling kind. Fine. That means that you are OK with losing the money.<br /><br />If you are, don&#039;t whine afterwards and learn from your mistake. Just do your civic druggie duty and warn others about the scams.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t fucking amazon people. Use your brain, You somehow found this place. IS there no sense of self preservation? Did you put the alarm bells on snooze? what fucking happened? <br /><br />If this fails guide fails you, the next time you lose money to GREAT DEAL FE ONLY ask your friend to punch you as hard as they can in your stupid face. Maybe pain will teach you where so many people in your life failed you. <br /><br /><br />Search the forums, you will find that I was the guy who warned all the tards out there when Montell Williams decided to do his Group FE Scam-O-pallooza.&nbsp; &nbsp;No one listened then.<br /><br />I warned people about auto43 and his chalk/bathtub juice he was hawking as steroids and eventually people started listening and he is out of business, finally. <br /><br />Fucking christ on a stick, if I wasn&#039;t stuck in this spammer limbo bullshit I would be updating the steroids mega-thread right now. <br /><br />

It is easy to think it does not matter for oneself if some newbies fall for easy scams not being careful.<br />But I still think FEing is hurting the concept of SR and attracting, encouraging and paying scammers so they can invest more and work harder to steal other peoples money. In some time I think they will be strong and rich enough to build such great trust and reputation pulling of big scams impossible to predict. Then by just minding our own biz and letting stupid ppl get scammed we also ruin good business opportunities for our selves in the future. Maybe its all fake feedback and a lottery with big clawed naughty ppl fishing for stupid small ones in the future.<br />Do you think my argument is valid or do you not think it matter at all for us if more and more newbies get scammed and the scammers grow more in numbers and get lots of money so they can hire people writing fake reviews, fake feedback, quickly hiding everybody warning about them behind pages of spam, blackmailing other vendors etc?<br /><br />Do you think the hundreds of people FEing to the italian bulldog-vendor I previously linked even have read his forum review thread linked in his profile? There are some quite serious accusations there that would make most people think twice before trusting him.<br /><br />Or did they maybe just look at the numbers, the stats, and see everybody else (we cant actually know how many orders are from different users..) finalizing early then think it must be safe and normal because everybody else is doing it?<br /><br />And you mister pussy, please just let me know which drugs you are taking and I will play nice for the rest of the day.<br /><br />

To trigger a &#039;forum slide&#039; and &#039;flush&#039; the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then &#039;replying&#039; to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#039;slides&#039; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now this is just a spam forum, so this thread cant be considered &quot;sensitive&quot; since its expected to blend in with the spam anyways and not important debate.<br /><br />But if this forum part would be about more experienced members giving advice to newbies the topic could maybe to some be considered &quot;sensitive&quot;, and people could make it disappear quickly among other chit chat threads if they wanted.<br /><br />Keep the feedback coming ppl, i&#039;d rather discuss this than spam my way to 50 :)<br />Just bump it or leave karma or something if you&#039;re to stoned to write ;)

				Steps I take. Never trust anyone, this is the internet and buying illegal drugs online. Never FE, I could never just hand over my coins before the product touches my hands it&#039;s like lending a stranger money and expecting them to pay you back. Trusted vendors or not, I could FE on a order and what if he ends up running with it, gets busted, etc...those coins are lost forever..It&#039;s been seen here on the board many times and the best tip I can give you. Do your research on the vendor and before placing a order send him/her a message to introduce yourself and ask about FE on what you&#039;re interested in and ask questions about FE. Following above I&#039;ve had the pleasure of working with some very professional and great vendors..

				Don&#039;t FE. Most of the time if you message vendors first and explain that you understand the rules and will finalize as soon as you receieve, they will waive the requirement.

Or,&nbsp; I just went through an ordeal today - bought new living room furniture, scheduled - or was told I was scheduling - the delivery for this Sat, found out yesterday not only was the delivery order was never placed, they initially said I had not paid the delivery fee.&nbsp; They went on for HOURS about how there was no mistake, my delivery was NEVER scheduled for this sat, this that and the other, not only are they not going to do anything about my problem, but from their view point, I DONT have a problem, and I am talking to the highest ranking employee/manager possible.&nbsp; About an hour later I got a call that &quot;there was a cancellation on Sat&#039;s schedule, would you like to be placed in that slot?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And honestly, how many of us working in retail can HONESTLY say we have never done something similar?&nbsp; I have - cust calls in, doing 500 things by yourself in an overly booked and understaffed estabishment, you write down what they need, but simply cannot get it done that minute, and then you forget about it.&nbsp; It was an honest mistake, but are you going to admit fault to the customer next week when their product hasnt arrived, or are you going to call it a glitch in the system, or an ordering error, or a shipping error, or whatever??&nbsp; In the jobs I have had, if you admit fault, you could very well end up paying the refund out of pocket - NOT something I was willing to do, but EXACTLY what happens here IF a package is wrong - even for the vendors operating as a business rather than just a small time dealer, I would imagine lost or wrong packages are actually eating into someone&#039;s profit margin or salary rather than some corporate account that is already sitting on billions of dollars.&nbsp; There was even one job I had that encouraged lying to customers on an on going basis because the problems with the logistical side of the business were so huge that constantly coming up with a new disaster went over better with the customers, even though they knew we were lying - and this was (and still is) a national company operating under 4 national brand names that most people trust, at least to a basic extent, and virtually all of their employee review profiles read the same as my experience, across the country.<br /><br />What makes me think some anon drug dealer on the net is more trust worthy than the people I deal with in person on a daily basis??

				Well written kittiesandpuppies!<br /><br />My questions were rethorical, with intent for members to ask them selves about those matters :)<br /><br />I agree with you on the most parts!<br />But when it comes to FE it does not really matter for me if I think it&#039;s worth it to me. If I see a established vendor with good feedback and some precious item I want, I can think of many worse ways to spend a few $ than to try him out and possibly establish a good win-win trading relationship. It&#039;s not possibly loosing a few $ that makes me not FE. It is the thought of how my few $ and risk taking will attract, encourage and pay fraudsters to come here and try their hardest to exploit this fine community making it rot from the inside when the fake feedback/reviews grows with the amount of scam sellers stealing all opportunities to honest trading from good people. I just like this site too much to allow my self being a part of its downfall, even if I miss out on some good deals and rare items!<br /><br />It&#039;s like investing in bitcoins for me, I have never done it because I think I&#039;m some kind of economical genius knowing where the price is going. I have done it because I love the concept of bitcoins and could see my cash go away with a smile if the price crashes knowing I supported the idea and took part in this historical phenomenon. If I would loose it because of investing in stocks after some advice from bank guys in suits every penny would hurt and I would walk around&nbsp; angry thinking about how I supported their bullisht materialistic ideals.

				It&#039;s great to see all the newbs here who know not to FE and why not.&nbsp; The future of SR is dependent on the knowledge and behavior of both vendors and buyers.<br /><br />I especially like the suggestion of messaging a vendor who is asking for FE, and discussing waiving it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t underestimate the value of personal communication, even on an illegal anonymous online drug market.<br /><br />When I was new, I was surprised at how good it felt to order a second or third time from a trusted vendor.&nbsp; SR is transient by nature but building a positive business relationship is still possible here.&nbsp; The best vendors should be rewarded with repeat business, in escrow, the way it was meant to be.

				Newb you seem to get it ;)<br />I messaged a vendor one time about his suspect FE policy. He replied and said he can do biz in escrow aswell some times without risk because he got the address of the buyer and can resolve any problems if there are any. I did not order from that guy and never will.<br /><br />One other vendor which I had previously had a very successful transaction with changed his FE policy. I messaged him and asked if I really needed to FE when I had completed a bigger order with him before without probs and have flawless stats.<br />He did not reply to me. I did not break my policy and deal outside FE even tho he was a top seller and my other transactions with him was flawless. Within a week people started to write about orders not showing up, big problems solving it in resolution center etc..

				I did not even check him out because what he writes in his profile or whatever he might write with his customers in privates is not of interest to me after reading what you said about him. I would never encourage anyone to order from a new vendor that only accepts FE. I think it is that kind of behaviour that will make the scammers bigger, stronger and faster.<br />Please if you do order and get your shit be quiet and happy. Dont be like &quot;hey all its super cool to FE all over SR you get great prices!!&quot; on the forums, because then you will only feed the scammers (even if the seller you talk about is cool, read my previous posts if you dont get my point)

				Had to get my 50 posts in on the newbie forum with this account before I could post a scam report on TheRX for selling me counterfeit MDMA.&nbsp; When I made my purchase he had a 100 rating.&nbsp; In the last ten days after he started shipping fake MDMA, it&#039;s dropped to 93 (falling further soon with my feedback after I finish getting my refund through the resolution center).&nbsp; &nbsp;At the time I made my purchase he wasn&#039;t yet asking people to finalize early.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t have under any circumstances.&nbsp; Many others who ordered this counterfeit product after me did finalize early and there&#039;s nothing they can do about getting ripped off.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of these people who finalized early said he did after he got a long message from TheRX explaining why he required it.&nbsp; I never saw the message from TheRX, but I can only imagine it was full of lies.<br /><br />Despite being only just out of newbie status in the forum, I ain&#039;t no newbie.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been around this block and a lot of other blocks as well.&nbsp; I can tell you with 100% certainty that there is NO legitimate reason to require FE, only greed.&nbsp; When you finalize early, you take away all the incentive for the vendor to do his job well.&nbsp; If it&#039;s an international shipment, there&#039;s real risk to the vendor just to ship the product.&nbsp; If you finalize early, he makes his money whether he actually ships anything to you or not.&nbsp; And if he doesn&#039;t even go to the post office, he&#039;s safer than if he does.&nbsp; The buyer can&#039;t legitimately blame a vendor for the failure of a package to clear customs.&nbsp; &nbsp;People who know the ins and outs of these businesses have assured me that there are more than juist a few vendors in the Netherlands who require FE who rarely if ever ship product, clearing a cool 100% profit.&nbsp; And how many of the people who FE actually follow up and revise the feedback after they receive their package.&nbsp; Almost never.&nbsp; So vendor gets a bunch of 5 ratings and continues scamming.&nbsp; Even if your package doesn&#039;t arrive, you don&#039;t have a valid reason to change the 5 rating because lost in customs is no one&#039;s fault, right?&nbsp; There are also vendors who do not require FE who make a pretty good scam living by having terms that generously promise maybe 50% or 80% refund on international shipments that don&#039;t arrive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, even if they are taken into resolution and required to pay up on all those lost orders, it&#039;s still a good profit if they never ship anything.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t believe me when I tell you this is happening, you&#039;re naive.&nbsp; I wish it wasn&#039;t happening but it is.&nbsp; Bottom line with international shipments, there&#039;s no way to know you&#039;re safe from scams in these deals.&nbsp; It can be much harder to find quality MDMA and some other drugs in the U.S. domestically, and more expensive, but if you can find&nbsp; them, pay the higher price.&nbsp; It truly is worth it for the peace of mind and the scams you avoided by sticking to domestic shipments.&nbsp; If you buy user type quantities, let the big domestic vendors in the U.S. figure out how to get it from the Netherlands to the US.&nbsp; They are much better equipped to do it and wouldn&#039;t you rather they take the risk?<br /><br />On domestic transactions, there is no valid reason at all for a vendor to require FE.&nbsp; At all,&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Except their greed of course.&nbsp; FE&nbsp; leaves buyers without any recourse or protection.&nbsp; If vendors try to tell you it&#039;s a cash flow problem, something about needing capital to make further investments in inventory, he&#039;s either doing it all wrong (dealing drugs, that is) and you don&#039;t want to be buying from a dealer that doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s doing, or he&#039;s lying.&nbsp; Don&#039;t believe vendors who claim they don&#039;t make much money on SR.&nbsp; The profit margins on the products sold here are HUGE (again, unless the dealer is an idiot).&nbsp; Would you commit serious felonies every day if you weren&#039;t making a lot of money doing it?&nbsp; I have had close friends who were distributors IRL and on SR and I can assure you, cash flow was not a problem..&nbsp; <br /><br />I get just furious when I hear people say &quot;low life drug dealer&quot; as if low life and drug dealer go together.&nbsp; Again, some of my close friends who are in the growing or distribution business in California are some of the most ethical people I know.&nbsp; They wouldn&#039;t be my friends if they weren&#039;t.&nbsp; They break drug laws because they are stupid and ill conceived.&nbsp; They don&#039;t steal or commit fraud because theft and fraud are just plain wrong.&nbsp; Everyone knows that.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know DPR personally, but it seems pretty clear just from the way this site operates that he&#039;s trying to raise this profession up to higher standards.&nbsp; I applaud that.&nbsp; Good vendors never require FE, and I guarantee that they make the lions share of the profits on SR by building long term relationships with customers they treat fairly.&nbsp; These customers keep coming back and bring their friends.&nbsp; Scammers require FE, make a lot of money in a relatively short period of time and then are gone, destroyed by their own shortsighted greed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t help them by FE&#039;ing.&nbsp; There, that&#039;s my rant for the day.&nbsp; Hope you enjoyed it.

				You have to be careful because there are vendors that will and do take advantage of newbies.&nbsp; As a newbie some vendors won&#039;t sell to you and those that do demand you FE early.&nbsp; I have only two transactions and one vendor scammed me and the other the order arrived in 3 days!<br /><br />The vendor that sent nothing, AlbertHoffman1943(99), put it back on me as if I did something wrong.&nbsp; Odd considering my next attempt had ZERO problems.&nbsp; Bottom line...Aside from not buying from AlbertHoffman1943(99), do not FE!!<br /><br />MidnightBlue(97) did not require FE and like I said, order arrived in days!

				In response to maria i wouldnt know for sure it was a fake member or not but the amount of posts would be a clue for example if someone posted saying yes i received an order and it was the first post i would be skeptical... i live in australia and our customs is pretty strict so i wouldnt order anything that wouldnt fit in a normal enevelope anyway... im not looking for sympathy i knew the risk when i took it and i took the risk because if i lost the money it wouldnt be the end of the world as it was only a small amount still i do agree that FE should be avoided if possible.

				dont FE, read the forums and dont just trust feedback scores. Read the feedback as well, don&#039;t just assume if its 5/5 its good. There are vendors who dont make you FE even if you&#039;re new so just look out for them until you have some transactions under&nbsp; your belt. I always check if someone else has bought the particular product I&#039;m going to buy. And read the forums for a few days before ever making a purchase.<br /><br />And if you get scammed, learn from it and post it on the forums.<br />

What makes a seller LEGIT? And what does it mean to be a LEGIT seller?<br /><br />Is a seller legit if 10 members write they recieve product? 50 members? 100 members?<br /><br />Do you feel this guy is so honest if every buyer send you 1$ before they make FE on his super prices you personally refund them 100% if they do not recieve anything?<br /><br />Please help discuss what is a legit vendor and what does it mean to be a legit vendor!<br /><br />and vip11 do you have a vendor account? Just put out some FREE/CHEAP samples 0,1-0,2g per sample should be enough if its coke and amount similar to 1-2 mid doses of heroin per sample to get people to compare your stuff to others.<br />Send samples to both random people and well known/good reviewers so you can try get a objective response to your product and get it tried by others who have bought similar products from other vendors so they can compare!<br /><br />Also dont be greedy. Look at some of the most respectable and appreciated vendors out there today telling their customers to STAY IN ESCROW and NOT FE!<br />A vendor who asks their customers to stay in escrow until order recived, never FE, and resolve any problems (which are not very common with these guys) with the resolution center is in my view someone who honor the system as much as I do.<br /><br />And drop all that &quot;disco shit&quot; &quot;bomb&quot; talk here. Only present it as what it is, and let your buyers judge quality and your rumor will make your biz explode.<br />If you come here tell people &quot;I got tha best shit on sr&quot; 1) nobody cares what you say about your own product 2) you scare customers because it is impossible for you to compare to all other products on sr and know you have the best, therefore you must be lying

				If someone wants to FE then that is up to them personally i dont like it but i can see why some vendors choose to make it a requirement when certain countries have tougher customs the risk cant all be placed on the seller... and as far as im concerned if i pay someone for a product and they provide me with my product in a reasonable amount of time then they are legit in my book.

I think there are many examples. I can easily name a few and I tink just some quick research would show there are quite many and I think a deep dive in the subject would show a amount of &quot;good&quot; vendors turning bad enough not to care if somebody seem legit or feels honest, but to use reason and logic and shake hands with anonymous men without pretending you know them.

				Hey maria if you read my previous posts you would see that i mentioned i am in australia and because of this i would never make bulk orders with any vendor as i dont think it would make it through our customs... i am also aware of some big vendors turning rogue this is of course always a possibility when you are dealing with what society would label criminals however in my opinion the vendors are heroes kings among men and i am willing to take the risk however everyone should obviously try to minimize that risk by research.

I really had no interest in signing up here until a vendor (Cimicon) wanted to dick me around. Dealing with him I&#039;ve learned my lesson about dealing with people who don&#039;t have a policy regarding re-ships/refunds/package interceptions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, you used a bad address or something was wrong with it such that your mail carrier decided that the package was non-deliverable as addressed. Your package, to which you had tracking information, remained at your post office for 5 days. During that time, you could have made an anonymous call to have a redelivery attempted. But you didn&#039;t. We offered you a 50% refund less shipping. But we were going to transfer it to you user to user so that your SR stats would not be affected by a refund. As stated. <br /><br />Somehow you thought you could do better in SR resolutions. They ruled 50%. Which is what we offered you. But instead of taking our offer which would have preserved your buyer stats, you now have a refund rate reflected on your buyer stats. This isn&#039;t Amazon where you can ship something back or it fails to make it to its destination you get a 100% refund. <br /><br />Next time a seller offers you a refund outside of SR resolutions, if it&#039;s 50% or better, take it. You avoid wasted time and preserve your buyer stats. <br /><br />And why don&#039;t we have a reship policy? Don&#039;t really need one. Everyone to date has used a proper address.You&#039;re the first to use a bad drop. Besides SR won&#039;t rule more than 50% in such cases .Everyone else who required a reship in the past was because order management would lose track of orders that were FE&#039;d and fail to ship. So it&#039;s not a reship, it&#039;s the first time it&#039;s being shipped. But that doesn&#039;t happen anymore since I joined. And if someone has an issue, they can send a message to get it resolved with us with our intention of handling things so as to preserve the buyer&#039;s stats.

				I might be overlooking something, but it seems clear to me that sending your address without PGP is the single riskiest move you can make on SR.&nbsp; Never do it!&nbsp; There is absolutely no reason to take that risk.&nbsp; If a vendor refuses to use PGP, why would you want to trust them with your business?&nbsp; This is a market, find a competitor.<br /><br />Privnote is a joke compared to PGP.&nbsp; If you want details you can find them in other threads.<br /><br />If any newbies are confused by this, let me know and I will point you to a helpful thread or two.

I was actually looking out for the guy&#039;s stats but somehow he thought going through SR to get the exact same thing we offered him would be better? When we got to resolutions, management made me drop my offer all the way down to 1% because sometimes when SR staff is busy they make snap judgements (and to teach the buyer a lesson in being negotiable). If we set the refund to the 50% we offered him and he having asked for 95% from SR reso, a snap judgement from SR staff could have been to give an average of the two desired refund rates. <br /><br />As many long time buyers on here will tell you, if a vendor offers you something that will preserve your stats, think about it and then take it. It&#039;s usually the best you will get.&nbsp; SR resolutions is for when a vendor never shipped or says they did but has no proof that they did. Or if the vendor denies you any sort of refund.

Be Careful<br />« on: March 16, 2013, 06:33 am »<br />Right,<br />&nbsp;So I started browsing around the site looking at all the large scale listings for ketamine, 100g +<br />And noticed a few vendors that were selling their stuff at considerably less than the others.<br />namley:<br /><br />ITALY<br />Drug Ape<br />BULLDOGISTHEBOSS<br /><br />Out of these 3, 2 of them list a huge range of drugs and precursors at amazing prices, all are stock fotos of the products...<br /><br />So I go ahead and place an order with Italy and receive the following:<br /><br />hello friend, thanks for order<br /><br />1) to address here privnote.com<br />2) NUMBER OF TELEPHONE, MOBILE<br />2) please, to finalize<br />3) you have MDMA in stock!<br />4) bottles available, cisono KETROL, KETAMAX, 100MG/10ML<br /><br /><br />I was concerned at having to provide my address unencrypted and a phone number obvs. So I asked for my order cancelled....<br /><br />The conversation went on like this:<br /><br />brother,<br />ok no telephone,<br />why ask why the phone, and one because the courier has wrapped delivery problems, but if you desidere so, ok<br /><br />your order is already ready to be shipped,<br />please give address privnote.com here, because my key does not work<br /><br /><br />--------------------------<br /><br />Hello,<br />Sorry, but If your PGP key does not work this is a very big security risk for me, I cannot Privnote my address. Please cancel my order or I will ask SR admin to do so.<br />ACE<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />brother,<br />but you are, why you are so deficient?<br /><br />for an address, you&#039;re making me cancel order?<br /><br />if you want to send it to me email italy1@tormail.net.<br /><br />your order, tomorrow left for Spain, I have already done it, now you can not say to cancel order<br /><br />doing the right person,<br />thanks<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />brother,<br />then?<br />already had, done,<br />I&#039;m waiting,<br />your<br />&nbsp; address<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />Hey:-)<br />no need to fall out. I wont send my address unencrypted, I think its stramge and dangerous for you to ask for phone numbers, and because of this I 100% will not FE. I am a vendor too and I struggle to understand why you would be unable to decrypt my address or why you wanted my phone number. I have contacted support. you cannot have posted my parcel as you clearly do not know my address...<br />please cancel my order.<br />ACE<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />brother,<br />I told you that the phone, do not want, ok<br />just because it was wrapped, customs call for problemicon address, but everything ok<br /><br />ok brother, to show you that I am honest, escrow<br /><br />-----------------------------------------<br /><br />Anyways, in the end the order was cancelled. <br /><br />It´s late and I am tired so I will let you guys draw your own conclusions, look at the 3 sellers listed above. I personally think they are LE, I have no solid proof, but I really think so.<br /><br /><br />I can only speak with the dealings I have had with ITALY, he has shining feedback, but no one on the forums mentions him? :/ The stats and things sold on the Drug Ape account make me inclined to think it is LE also, but had no dealings with him.<br /><br />As for Bulldogistheboss.. Kinda hoping hes not, feedback seems legit, hes really new though. I was hoping to place my order with him. Anyone have any experience<br /><br />ACE[/quit]<br /><br />Nice work brother Mafia sharing that information with us here ;) That stuff can really help brothers who are new to this place<br />And brother please let us know how your transactions with ITALY and BULLDOG goes! (Nobody here could probably make a guess in their wildest imagination what can happen..)<br /><br />And brother please tell us why you decided to order from those two vendors? the good prices? the nice stats?<br />Have you read threads in forum about ITALY and BULLDOG?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />WHAT supposed to mean?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />sorry if I was unclear. how is your order going? what do you think about the post i quoted which you had thanked the person who wrote it?<br /><br />About the stats thing.

Is it good prices? 30% off if buyer FE? Good bulk deals? If vendor have good profile text?<br /><br />I must confess I myself did FE on a new seller who sent out many cheap generous samples for postage expenses and FE at roughly 0.2btc. Sample arrived but if I ever buy bigger than sample from same vendor I will not FE.

				Been lucky finding some nice samples while being broke. <br />Recieved a generous meph sample with roughly 0,5 stone, 0,5 blue/greyish + 2 pills a while ago.<br />I let 2 friends do the pills, both got in a very empathic state laying in bed talking about how much they love eachother and me generally having a smooth high like mid-low mdma without hard comedown.<br />Another guy did iv (i would have tried to stop him if I knew because I didnt know of anyone doing it with this batch) 0,2g of the blue stuff while having quite large 3mmc tolerance (claimig to dose 0,5-1g iv) and got a great rush instantly dropping all doubts of it not being real meph. I did 2 50-150mg bombs while on LSD and got great mdma-like warm sensation feeling euphoric.<br /><br />I also got 2 zopiclon and 5 librium samples from theXchange. I would say 10mg librium is most similar to 0,5 lorazepam. zopiclon was right stuff giving metallic taste and half tab giving great sleep.<br /><br />hoping 2 get 2x150mg E pills and 2x codeine pills earliest 2morrow but probably next week.<br /><br />1-2 times per day I check a few pages interesting categorie for special rare products, free or cheap samples or maybe some great deal sorting the listings after &quot;newest&quot;.<br /><br />It can be a gold mine but you often see lots of suspicious deals that you have to resist chancing.<br /><br />Some new users &quot;giving&quot; samples might just be collecting addresses or info.<br /><br />Today I saw a &quot;free suboxone&quot; deal. looked to good to be true. Then shipping was 0.4+btc so it was priced like most others. just a cheap trick.

				Lending my experience to help others out.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go outside the Silk Road. I got a &#039;long con&#039; and after 6 months the scammer got away with 45 bitcoins (when they were $10). Sucks, I know. However I&#039;ve learned my lesson and have not had a problem going inside the Silk Road. Not finalizing early, not being bullied by vendors, and just doing a lot of reading/researching.<br /><br />Although, one time I did order samples and the vendor never sent. I only had to pay postage, so it wasn&#039;t a huge deal and 2-3 months later I updated my review to reflect more than just &quot;FE early, will update&quot;. The vendor promptly contacted me and sent me the samples.

				I mostly agree with what Maria has posted. Thanks for your tips! However, as a newbie I have FEd once from a vendor with good feedback, and I had no problems with the transaction. The transaction was small, so I was not risking a big loss. <br /><br />I have also FEd a transaction from a seller from whom I had purchased before, after I received an underweight order and was promised that I would be shipped the missing amount. But after I FEd I did not receive the missing amount I was told would be sent. I am still waiting for it, but I am not sure if I will ever receive it. The seller has been good communicating with me, but I am still waiting for the missing amount.<br /><br />At the same time, I do understand that sellers want to protect themselves from con buyers, or from the risk that shipments might be intercepted by zealous customs agents, such as Australia. So my tips would be to first locate reputable sellers by reading the forums, try to choose sellers that do not require FE, and if you want to order from a seller that requires FE, make sure that it is for a small order and that the seller is reputable.

				Dear Pirates of the Road,<br /><br />I have a confession to make. I have broken the first rule of SR - &quot;Never talk about SR&quot;.<br />My lack of attention and patience resulted in the stupid idea of talking about SR outside of the community. I was very naive thinking I helped people to stay away from problems with LE and dangerous street criminals and their psycho drug logics mixing all kinds of shit calling it pure product. In reality I triggered very destructive behaviours among addicts and endangered many lives (thank god the probabilities of danger &amp; death while driving cars, crossing roads, drinking alcohol among drunks etc are so high so I can compare with everyday life to ease my guilt). Feels like I&#039;ve started a fire on my own ship. Because of this my mind will always be heavy of guilt, shame and fear. (but hey, life is lethal, right? lets try to make the best of it)<br /><br />But I will never break the &quot;second rule&quot; about caution against confidence. I have always had great respect for LE and politicians (even tho many are sadistic psychopaths) because they often do the most ungrateful shitty work on the planet while I am having good times getting high. The day LE enter my home or attack me in the streets I will ask them how I can help. &quot;Be kind for every man you meet is fighting a hard battle&quot; -Plato

				Long read but a good thread, bump! I like to think the best of people but, yeah, scamming is a possibility that is always on my mind here. I don&#039;t think it was mentioned that you can go back and edit your feedback and rating now. For what it is worth here is my purchasing process:<br /><br />- If I&#039;ve not bought from a vendor before I usually just send a quick hello and make sure they are cool with dealing with me before ordering. A non-sketchy seeming reply is a good start.<br /><br />- Buy small amounts (if, like me, you are not a big user or are not also buying for others very often)<br /><br />- Encrypt delivery address<br /><br />- Wait until the product arrives. If it looks / tests OK then I finalize and leave good feedback.<br /><br />- After I use the gear I&#039;ll go back and update feedback about if it was good or not. It is even possible to edit rating now. I like how buyers are able to change that 5/5 for fast delivery down a bit for bad product!<br /><br />- Sometimes I&#039;ve let vendor know if their product worked good for me or not.<br /><br />All the vendors&#039; I&#039;ve dealt with have been awesome (nice gear, too!). Take care all.<br />

But their eyes often witness about how desperate they are and what traumas they&#039;ve been through and if you wait them out they&#039;ll beg you for some coins sooner or later like that pile of cash never existed.<br /><br />There&#039;s many storys of ppl who ruined their lives by following orders from ppl they dont know (often after being tricked into debts). They carry stuff trough customs because men in suits told them everybody is paid off and there&#039;s nothing to worry about. Then they get busted and fucked for life, the cops get nice stats to present which keep their salaries up and the suits can carry the drugs over the border while cops are busy or just keep on doing whatever the fuck they do... exchanging lives for money?

				Haha great story! Text only is just so different from buying in person but I agree that you should not just &quot;do as you&#039;re told&quot;. Find the correct procedure for operating on the SR and stick to it, despite your own desires, right?

				not sure how to read the &quot;despite your own desires&quot; part. please elaborate if you can. <br /><br />be in it for the game not for the fame. dont do the crime if you cant do the time.<br /><br />So glad I never tried (or ever will) to exploit SR to becaome a rich big shot. I would probably not be here today if I had. But I confess i&#039;ve been very tempted and still are. So glad i got some self restraint.

				Well I&#039;m thinking that there must be a process you can follow on SR that minimizes your chances of being scammed and reduces your losses if you are. Buy small amounts minimizes loss if scammed, for example. Text is so impersonal so I figure a good process (and some gut instinct) is all buyers have.<br /><br />What I mean by &quot;despite your own desires&quot; is that once you think you have a reasonable purchasing process you have to not let your desire to go for a super-duper-cheap-deal or for some ultra-mega-special-gear (or whatever) lead you away from it.<br /><br />Can vendors&#039; on SR can become rich big shots without needing to scam?<br /><br /><br />

				Sounds like a very reasonable concept.<br /><br />I believe vendors CAN be successful but it&#039;s probably a million times harder than being a successful buyer. Is a&nbsp; &quot;scam&quot; transaction a scam if it results in a buyer not overdosing when being scammed out of money and drugs? Is a transaction not a scam if it results in the vendor making dangerous bulk deals which puts his/others life and freedom in danger?

				Thanks for your appreciation :) Smoke one for me aswell!<br />You seem to have missed my point tho. Buying and taking drugs is NOT as risky as &#039;they&#039; try to make you believe. For us end users it&#039;s actually quite safe (and a mighty rewarding experience if done right) if you know how to keep your head cool and do your homework first. Compare with driving a car, if you do it with precaution you can drive all your life without any accidents, but if you let your guard down or jump in a car hitting the pedal to the metal without any knowledge or experience you will be munching asphalt very soon. For the brave ones on the top it must be very hard to sleep well at night. Thats why kids or generally slow minded ones should NOT drive or do drugs.

But if you are afraid of vendors I dont think you should use SR at all. Buy from someone you trust instead if you are afraid what will happen if someone call the cops on you.<br /><br />I dont care if FBI/CIA/DEA/local police/my family/criminals gets calls from some stupid vendor who does not like my rating but haven&#039;t tried discussing it with me first. I have nothing to hide and no reason to be afraid of people. I respect all life. I just get angry at what it DOES some times, not what it is. I never get violent and I always try hard not to hurt others (not the simplest thing in this world all the time). I like sharing what I have and I dont like taking what is not mine. I gladly help others but have a hard time asking for help from ppl who might need it better themselves. I am not interested in profitable illegal activites, I just want to buy some nice rare drugs for my own consumption and experimentation without involving too many ppl around me that might get bad influence from me and endanger their health.<br /><br />If some vendor wanna fuck my life because of a honest review there is nothing I can do about it, just as I can do nothing about some random psycho running out from the woods killing me for no reason. I&#039;m not perfect and neither are you - let&#039;s make it better instead of worse.<br /><br />Drugs &amp; medicine have always been a big passion of mine along with living happily and being mindful where I think consumption of different drugs (DONT GET ME WRONG HERE AND START DOING ALL DRUGS YOU CAN, DO AS LITTLE AS YOU CAN AS SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE AS POSSIBLE AND YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY) can help give greater insight in what we are and how we work. Responsible drug habits can also improve both your mental and physical health greatly which is of course one of my greatest goals, but as the majority of drug users I have probably destroyed my body and mind quite alot on the way. But I have also gained lots of knowledge which probably have helped other humans, and hopefully will continue doing so.

				Thanks for your appreciation!<br /><br />If you like the idea I recommend to read trough all posts and question what you don&#039;t understand, comment the posts that you think might be wrong and share your own views on the topic of how beginners can avoid getting ripped off. There is enough in this thread for you to quickly make posts that actually matter and helps people, to reach your 50 posts, which imo is alot better than the regular newbie keyboard-shitting to 50 plus you will learn from others by reading and about yourself by writing :)

Customer can lose a lot of money while the vendor gains all the money while having paid just a little for the product.<br /><br />BUT: There are also a lot of people making new accounts and claiming not to have received anything, not even a love letter from customs. Not only are they not willing to pay a thing, but also drop ratings of vendors. <br />So there is also a whole different story about vendors and scamming by customers. <br /><br />What are peoples thoughts about that?

				the only way to level the playing field is by employing the escrow system -- dismiss it at your own peril<br /><br />if you want to be extremely risk averse (and i&#039;m referring to those that are fearful of vendor scams) do NOT use your personal information -- there are plenty of ways to get an anonymous mailbox - there are plenty of threads on this issue alone<br /><br />keep your cool -- if you come out half-cocked and combative, there is little likelihood the story will end well for you<br /><br />do your homework - read ALL the info you can about a vendor prior to engaging him/her in business - it is prefereable to deal EXCLUSIVELY with established vendors (9 mo. of clean record at least)<br /><br />Things do happen however - I had a very strong relationship with a vendor and started the habbit of FEing out of respect and generosity -- turned out the dude got busted and there was nothing to do about it<br /><br />remember you are playing a risky game - remember the stakes and only take on risks you can actually tolerate -- if you can&#039;t afford to lose 500 bucks, then spend 100 and go slowly<br /><br />best of luck to all of the honest brokers out there
