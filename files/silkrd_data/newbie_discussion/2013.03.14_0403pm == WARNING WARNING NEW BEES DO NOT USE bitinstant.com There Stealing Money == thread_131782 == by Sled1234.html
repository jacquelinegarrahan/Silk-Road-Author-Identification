				i use &#039;multibit&#039; for wallet &amp; coinbase.com to buy coins. both sites have a clean &amp; smooth UI. processing for BC purchases takes 3 - 5 days. transfers of the purchased BC are relatively quick. easiest method of purchase is to directly link a bank account.

				How did you lose $500 with them?&nbsp; Have you contacted them?&nbsp; Give us more details, please.&nbsp; And they are not scammers, so you just need to keep at trying to contact them to get this resolved.&nbsp; They do have a phone number.

				I&#039;d also be interested in more details..<br /><br />I had planned on using them; however, every time I went to send cash their online website was down.&nbsp; I ended up getting frustrated and using Bitfloor.&nbsp; It was easy and quick, but it seems Bitinstant has less fees.<br /><br />Anyone else having a problem with Bitinstant since they&#039;ve been back up?&nbsp; OR success stories?

				I don&#039;t think they scammed you. They&#039;re just swamped with issues and it&#039;s only 3 people working on all of them. I had a order from cash to bitstamp and ended up getting a email stating they&#039;re low on funds. Sent a email and got a reply back from Rachel..After that nothing, countless emails and no replies for 2 days...Till I sent a final email stating how urgent it was and what it was for (A lie for them not to turn me down) and 30 mins later Seth sent an email that my transfer has been completed. It&#039;s frustrating I know but, all you can do is email them and try to get a hold of Gareth on the forums...Can&#039;t really do anything else.<br /><br />I love bitstamp but, with the current problems that bitinstant is facing it&#039;s just not worth the headache. I&#039;m go with Blue Sky or back to bitfloor for my coins.
