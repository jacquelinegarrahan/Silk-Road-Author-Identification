				Hi all, my first post on SR, I thought why not start off with some basic compartmentation guidelines.<br />I&#039;ve seen a lot of decent/good tutorials on how to set up a pretty secure solution for browsing SR.<br />However, I haven&#039;t really seen a post explaining the values of compartmentation.<br />So I thought I&#039;d share some insight from my extend and hope to spark a discussion.<br /><br />----- Compartmentation -----<br /><br />What I mean by compartmentation is keeping your illicit activities apart form other activities.<br />This sounds way easier then it is. A slip of tongue can easily lead to someone having doubts about your activities, which is enough to face difficult questions. <br />The basic rule of compartmentation is: STFU.<br />Never tell anyone what your intentions are, other then the people involved.<br />In this thread I&#039;ll talk a little about how compartmentation COULD work, possible contamination and how to maintain a low profile afterwards.<br />Compartmentation takes time and effort, but will pay off when done right. <br /><br />----- Separation -----<br /><br />When talking about compartmentation it&#039;s basically separation of information. (Damn that sounds nice)<br />You don&#039;t want to share information about your private life within your illicit activities, but you don&#039;t want it the other way around. <br />For example: the only people who know I am a SR member are people from SR. I never talk about it to anyone.<br />Not on other (clearnet) communities, not to drug users, I never share anything outside of SR.<br />The same goes for my private life: Apart from the people I have a relation with, nobody knows anything about me. Not even what kind of movies I like. I keep it strictly business. <br />This goes for every community I am a part of. <br /><br />Another example: Let&#039;s say BOB practices both baseball and basketball.<br />He never talks about basketball when playing baseball and the other way around.<br />As far as his baseball teammates know, the only sport he practices is baseball.<br />He never even mentions basketball around them.<br /><br />The golden rule is: Keep your mouth shut. I think you get the idea.<br /><br />----- Identities -----<br /><br />For many illicit activities you need an identity. Simply because a lot of times it involves communication and so person A needs to know a way to contact person B.<br />Considering compartmentation, you should have a different identity for every activity you do.<br />On SR I&#039;m know by the handle &quot;1llude&quot;. For every community I am part of I have a different handle.<br />This may seem easy, but everything should be &quot;unique&quot; for every identity. <br />There should be no way to link identity A to identity B. <br />This ranges from using different handles and e-mails, to even different personality&#039;s. <br />You can go as far with this as you&#039;d like, and the further the better, but remember that you should always stick to your identity. So the more you make up, the more you&#039;d have to remember. A good reason to keep personal interaction to a minimum.<br /><br />----- Contamination -----<br /><br />We&#039;ve talked a bit of contamination in the previous subjects. Contamination is when one identity get&#039;s mixed with another. There are literally thousands of possible forms of contamination and it&#039;s almost impossible to prevent all of them. However, if you take it in consideration you can keep it to a minimum, so that no identifying information will be leaked. <br />For example, never share ANY information about illicit activities to people not participating.<br />I can&#039;t stress this enough. Never tell your friends/family/partners that you even know the slightest bit of an illicit activity. Don&#039;t raise any suspicion. You simply can&#039;t trust anyone. If you can&#039;t keep your mouth shut when the information is valuable to you, why would someone else keep the information secret when it&#039;s of no value to them.<br /><br />It also works the other way around. Never share any personal information within the illicit activity.<br />This should be your number 1 rule, since this leads to most compromises.<br />Only share information that is needed for the activity, nothing more.<br />Do not talk about your gender, age, location, sexual preferences, hobby&#039;s, climate, pets, diets, diseases, etc etc.<br />You might think this is common sense when practicing illicit activities, but you&#039;ll be amazed how many people share the slightest bit of identifying information. People wanting to compromise your identity will collect and evaluate this info to get a profile. <br />So again: STFU!<br /><br />----- Compartmentation in action -----<br /><br />Now here comes the fun part. I&#039;m going to describe a method of compartmentation and how to avoid contamination. Please note that this is purely educational, and you should find your own way of implementing this.<br /><br />First I&#039;ll define a few things so it&#039;s easier to follow:<br /><br />Activity 1 = Illicit activity you don&#039;t want others to know about<br />Activity 2 = A different illicit activity<br /><br />You&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = The person practicing compartmentation<br />Person A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Person needed for activity 1<br />Person B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= Person needed for activity 2<br /><br />So, let&#039;s say you want to contact person A for any reason imaginable.<br />What you should do is first set up a secure workstation.<br />There are plenty of guides on this but the important part is that you set up a NEW workstation strictly for activity 1 and contacting person A.<br />When done you create a new handle. This handle should consist of a randomly chosen nickname (that could not be linked to you) and a form of communication. Again there are plenty of guides on how to securely communicate, the important part here is that this handle is strictly for activity 1 and contacting person A.<br /><br />A real life scenario COULD be:<br />Installing a new OS host on your computer.<br />Boot up the host and do NOTHING but update and install virtualization software.<br />Inside virtualization software install a new OS with security and anonymity in mind (like debian + tor or an OS for this specific purpose like Whonix)<br />Within the virtualized OS create your new identity.<br /><br />Now, this setup should ONLY be used for activity 1. If you want to contact person B you&#039;d have to go through the same steps again so you have a completely new identity for activity 2. <br />Person A should never know you also have connections with person B and vice versa.<br /><br />The problem here is that there is a chance where you&#039;d need to contact multiple people for the same activity.<br />Let&#039;s say activity 1 is SR. There&#039;s a great chance you want to contact more then 1 person. <br />You&#039;ll create more connections that link you to the illicit activity. <br />PGP helps you to at least hide some content of the illicit activity but sill leaves you with the connections. <br />You could chose for participating in activity 1 the way I mentioned above, and create sub-identity&#039;s to contact with persons involved. So you&#039;ll set up a new &quot;disposable&quot; identity for the sole purpose of contacting another participant. When there is no further need for communication, you erase the identity and never use it again.<br /><br />This takes a LOT of time and effort. You should also be aware of what you&#039;re doing the entire time. <br />However this can minimize connections to you and your illicit activity&#039;s, and that is, in my eyes, priceless.<br /><br /><br />----- Discussion -----<br />Alright, so this is my view on basic compartmentation.<br />There are a lot of other options and considerations to practice good compartmentation but I might cover that later.<br />I hope I inspired some people and that others here are practicing compartmentation already.<br />I&#039;d like to spark a discussion and receive (constructive) criticism to improve methods of compartmentation and securing your identity. <br />Feel free to comment or question anything!
