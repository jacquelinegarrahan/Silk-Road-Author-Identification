Also as a vendor you have access to another portion of the forum but you have to have x amount of transactions worth x amount of sales in 1 month. Didn&#039;t know that before buying the vendor account but I guess it makes sense. The downside is as a noob vendor I would like to ask questions to other vendors on preferred practices now before I make mistakes. Guess I will just take it slow like I have done with everything since joining SR.

				<br />I hear about the secret vendor forum but no idea if its of any use or not lol. People like cheap intro deals and samples, they seem to be best ways of getting legit feedback.<br />[/quote]<br /><br /><br />Good point about the samples, however I think my plan is to just offer sane pricing for what I grow. It&#039;s a lot of work to do this safely and I have no interest in becoming a broker of tons of product. Also, the free deals don&#039;t seem like a fair way to get legit feedback. I was just reading a thread where some guy ripped apart the vendor then he offered him some new hash product for nothing and then it was post after post of sugar and spice. I&#039;ll sell what I have as normal price to friends plus shipping and this seems to be much less than what I see posted anyway. I&#039;ve been at it for the last 25yrs but I&#039;m just a small fry around SR and I will only have a few pounds of&nbsp; excess my locals won&#039;t scarf up. It&#039;s funny when you get older, work, kids, partners, ect.&nbsp; make many drift away from the scene and I don&#039;t want to replace them locally. I have a great job, a honey bunny, and so on but I love my plants too so I don&#039;t want to downsize. I&#039;m hoping SR will let me keep my babies while protecting my personal security.<br /><br />
