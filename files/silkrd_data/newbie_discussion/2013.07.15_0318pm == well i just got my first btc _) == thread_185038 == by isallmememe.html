				it all went thru without a hitch. i decided to do a bank deposit in the vendors branch because my bank was giving me problems with doing a transfer online. seems i forgot to update my new phone number a few months ago and this is necessary for the transaction. went into town and deposited the cash and the btc was in my localbitcoins account by the time i got home. which was only 10 minutes.<br /><br />just found out tho, i get charged to transfer my btc into my btc wallet and then get charged again when i transfer it out. never seen that mentioned before. wish i&#039;d transferred it straight to sr now.<br /><br />

				Congratulations on getting your BTC. Wallets like Electrum let you specify the transfer fee you want to assign. Fortunately even a small fee such as .0005 helps things move along a little faster. You can certainly assign no fee when you transfer, but it tends to make the confirmations take a lot longer since transactions with a fee seem to all get processed first.

				it was about £1&nbsp; on a £45 transfer<br /><br />also, did i read on here correctly that it can take up to 6 hours to get it into your sr account? ..i&#039;m now getting a bit paranoid. what would happen if my internet cut out for a bit? it happens here now and again and i don&#039;t want to see my cash go floating off round cyberspace where i can&#039;t get it.
