				My fake ID was taken last week by a local gas station, I was just using it to buy alcohol.&nbsp; I bought it from a vendor on the road and as far as I could tell there was no way to tell it was fake, but they did.<br /><br />Anyways, its been a week and I haven&#039;t heard from LEO. I&#039;m under supervision and ID has my real name on it so i&#039;m concerned I may be getting a knock from them.&nbsp; I have no idea what they do with their fake IDs.&nbsp; Should I be worried about anything?<br /><br />Convo went like this<br /><br />&quot;This is fake.&quot;<br />&quot;No, its not&quot;<br />&quot;I&#039;ll call the cops&quot;<br />*I walk out*

				Well being how it&#039;s a fake id they most likely think the name on it is fake too. They most likely won&#039;t call the cops just took the id and tossed it don&#039;t worry too much about it it&#039;s probably the last you&#039;re gonna hear about it.

				I appreciate it guys, I figured it was just my paranoia.<br /><br />I just knew if something had happened to someone in my shoes, and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s been someone in these shoes before, you guys would know.

				i had a cop ask me which of my DL&#039;s was real when he illegally went through my wallet one night.<br />I had a DL of the state i was in (which was real) and a fake out-of-state and the fake was so legit<br />LEO asked which was fake.<br /><br />PS i always recomend to people who are getting IDs<br /><br />*Use real first (and middle) and fake last name*<br />&nbsp;possibly your mothers maiden name (so you wont forget/mispronounce)<br /><br />but if someone walks into the store and knows you they may greet you by your first name<br />and it should be the same as the one on your ID<br /><br />however it is best to use fake last name in case something like this happens<br />a fake last name even with a real picture is basically useless<br /><br />FOR NEXT TIME:<br />-try and stand your ground even insist he call the cops to verify (call their bluff)<br />-grab your ID outta their hand when they let their guard down and run outta the place<br />-buy something that requires 18 y/o first to see if the store is &#039;cool&#039; or really &#039;strict&#039;<br /><br />go make or buy a secondary ID so you can show this to them if theres any doubt<br />( Example: Drivers license, passport, SS card, school ID etc.)<br />

				Ain&#039;t nothin to worry about OP. Got my&nbsp; ID taken away when I was on holiday once. It worked almost 6 different times at the same little country store and then a young girl that rang me up questioned the fading hologram and took it to her manager who proceeded to call security for the resort. I just dipped outtah the store and took it as a small loss; nothing ever happened after that.
