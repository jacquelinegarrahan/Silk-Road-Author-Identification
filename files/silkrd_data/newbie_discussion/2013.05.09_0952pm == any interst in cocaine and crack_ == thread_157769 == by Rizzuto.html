				first off i would like to say hi to the community as i am a new face and hope to stay for a long time. <br /><br />the reason for this post is i am wondering if there is an interest in cocaine and crack i would ship it worldwide at around $100-105 per gram maybe offer weight such as: 0.5, 1g, 2g etc even bulk 28g+ <br /><br />i would like to maybe offer my products to everyone around the world if there is much interest and i think a good way to build my face when i open a vendor account is offer 6 samples, i am also experienced in security and shipping so your information is safe, encrypted and never saved..<br /><br />thank you for your time everyone.

				If you want someone to tell you if your coke/crack is good, I am a very eligible participant and will definitely be honest. <br /><br />As picky as they come, FWIW.

				Hello Rizzuto yes there is constant demand for quality cocaine, if you can provide good quality for a fair price with consistency, you&#039;ll have a flow of loyal custom. If you wish to boost your business, alongside offering samples in exchange for reviews, you can add EZ Test results to your listing, and can apply to PineappleLove after a couple of months of vending coke for a quantitative analysis test &#039;Independent Cocaine Lab Test Results (See the OP)&#039; dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108950.0 Hope this helps you and I wish you all the best :)

				MUCH interest.&nbsp; New convert to cocaine, find I LOVE it.&nbsp; My Love is a major fan and becomes insatiable (even more than usual which says MUCH).<br /><br />I love to write and will give honest feedback.&nbsp; With my Love&#039;s experience and my passion we will be great reviewers.

				Hi, I&#039;m finding that there&#039;s a shortage of good crack. I&#039;d be very interested in buying that if you could provide. If you do, it&#039;s good to have small weights for sale to sample first too, I wouldn&#039;t want to buy a gram only to find that it&#039;s no good. Some 0.2g samples for sale is what I look for when trying new gear. But yes, keep us posted.&nbsp; And to misspentyouth, sex on coke/crack is amazing isn&#039;t it, until the anxiety sets in, or the stimulant equivalent of Brewers Droop! My ex and myself used to love drug fueled sex and shower nights...

				crack, cocaine, meth, heroin, there is always an interest in these. just avoid scamming and offer good competitive prices and you can do it, however your lack of thread reply is concerning<br /><br />

				I have only bought domestic up to now to try and minimize risk, and in the UK there&#039;s not much choice. Perhaps the US have more choice? Competition is always a good thing for the buyers though, so, bring it on new vendor, and I could give you a try

				I am pretty surprised that everyone is charging so much for soft.&nbsp; If someone just started offering it for around 80 a G or less, they would take over.

				Also, you know what would make your coke sell like hot cakes?&nbsp; Put a pain killer in with a G, because every time I get into this shit, I forget the landing gear and I stay far far away until I forget how much it sucked.

				There most definitely is interest in cocaine.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve seen, all you need to do is supply consistent product that is of high purity at a reasonable price that&#039;s free of nasty active cuts such as Ephedrine, Phenacitine, Levamisole and anything ending in &#039;caine&#039; that isn&#039;t &#039;cocaine&#039;!<br /><br />The members here tend to salivate over product that doesn&#039;t arrive as a fine powder and that sparkles and glistens in the light.<br /><br />If you can provide such things, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be welcomed with open arms and open virtual wallets :)<br /><br />Laissez-faire!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				As long as your gear is top notch, your customer service is professional, and your security is discrete, I don&#039;t see why you can&#039;t have a loyal following of fans here on the Silk Road dude.

				I&#039;m sure there will be love for it, already plenty of listings and if you have good stuff for a good price, you&#039;ll make a name for yourself. Good luck starting out as a new vendor! But don&#039;t lose your street customers cuz it seems like some people getting in pretty sticky situations when the site goes down for a few days
