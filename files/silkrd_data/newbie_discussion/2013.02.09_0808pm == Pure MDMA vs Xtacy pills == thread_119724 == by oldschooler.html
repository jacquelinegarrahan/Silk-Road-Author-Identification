				Hello folks,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to the boards, I appreciate the forum to post my questions:<br /><br />I could use some advice from some folks with more experience.&nbsp; Back in the day when used to take X pills, there was never any pure forms that I was ever exposed too.&nbsp; The main reason we took X was really to screw our brains out.&nbsp; So here&#039;s my questions:<br /><br />1) As far as taking X just for hours of mind blowing sex, what kind would you all recommend?&nbsp; Is powder better for that?&nbsp; Is a 200mg x pill the same as 1/5 of a gram of powder.&nbsp; It seems like the few times I have had X in the past 20 years or so its all cut with I guess speed so that kind of sux.&nbsp; I am not trying to get super high just that feeling where everything is awesome and every girl looks like the hottest thing on earth!<br /><br />2) My second question is, I see adds for 100 % MDMA pills ranging from 100mg&#039;s to 315mg&#039;s for sale.&nbsp; This might seem like a stupid question, but why would anyone buy anything but the highest MG&#039;s and just split it?&nbsp; Am i missing something?&nbsp; Is the high from certain types of pills on here different or does it just depend on the MG&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry for the questions, but I&#039;m kind of confused.<br /><br />Thank you,

				Sorry dude, at first when I read this I thought it was a joke seeing as how I only have a few years of experience with &quot;Xtacy&quot;, however I grew up in an age where information like this was much more accessible. <br /><br />Try some of these sites to get you started <br />http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/forum.php<br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma.shtml<br /><br />But dude I feel like if you want hours of mind blowing sex then &quot;Xtacy&quot; is not the drug for you. I&#039;ve heard MDA works well for this purpose but my experience with MDMA is that, yes it will make girls and everything else look beautiful, but is more suited for cuddling than sex. <br /><br />As for the differences between pills and crystals... If you are on SR, then go with the crystals because there are some high quality drugs here, and they are also much easier to get through the mail than pressed pills. <br /><br />If you plan on going to a concert/rave/festival and want to wait to buy some &quot;Xtacy&quot; there...it is best to memorize all the information on this site:<br /><br />http://www.pillreports.com/<br /><br />for your area, then only buy pills that have been tested and reviewed by other users...never buy powders or crystals off randoms unless they will marquis test it in front of you. <br /><br />Hope you learn a lot and enjoy your time on the road!<br /><br />-Chairman
