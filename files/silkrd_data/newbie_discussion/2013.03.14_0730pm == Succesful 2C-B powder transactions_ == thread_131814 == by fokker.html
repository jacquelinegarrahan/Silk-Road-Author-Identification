				I ordered a few months 2CB from Gammagoblin, and I received it quickly. The quality was OK, but a little bit on the weaker side. I needed around 40 mg taken all at once to have a medium-strong experience. However, I am not sure if gammagoblin currently has 2cb in stock.

				Well, here&#039;s my trip report from about 25mg of theGrandWizardsLair 2C-B:<br /><br />June 1st 2013<br />I saw fractals when I closed my eyes. I had the ability to physically melt with external objects. I had absolutely no sense of time. I had no physical body because it became one with everything. The phenomenal world and my mental states were totally malleable and in my control. I said at one point &quot;I&#039;ve never felt so powerful in my life&quot;. I realized that my consciousness gives birth to the world and in a way I&#039;m totally in charge of the phenomenal experience. I walked over to a grip and did a one-arm pull up with each arm...I cannot do that sober, not even close. Today my bicep fuckin hurts, I pushed my arm beyond it&#039;s physical capacity!<br /><br />I feel like I don&#039;t need to do psychedelics for many years. I&#039;m set. It&#039;s time to work on and focus my energy into this life game. But anyways, at one point I was standing knee deep in the ocean and the biggest revelation of my entire lift smacked me in the face. It felt like one of those religious moments that converts or prophets speak of.<br /><br />There&#039;s this great essay Schopenhauer wrote about free will and our lack of it in the phenomenal world. He said that in a transcendent way we do have free will in the world of noumena (Will as thing-in-itself) but that it doesn&#039;t act on the world of phenomena...something like that. So when I was tripping it made perfect sense that the future was already written and this whole soup of twirling phenomena was fated. But what I was really curious about was noumena...whether or not it&#039;s divine. What I realized in the water is that there&#039;s no objective answer and that it was totally up to me to create that reality. Like it&#039;s not objectively true that god does or doesn&#039;t exist, I have the power to create him. I had this limited sense of transcendental free will and the only fucking possible choice in life to be made was whether or not to believe noumena is divine. Simple. A leap of faith, an affirmation, &quot;God&quot; as a choice not a fact. As soon as I made the affirmative choice I was fuckin overwhelmed with divine beauty, it was unreal, so perfect. God is a subject not an objectâ€¦we are that subject, we are gods, and we have the power to create divinity as a subject realizing it&#039;s own godhood.<br /><br />I realized my ancestors are always present, always at a distance but must be recognized and accepted. I realize the way to clean up California&#039;s coastline is to find hippies and give them drugs and trash bags. We bathed in the sea and Pink Floyd&#039;s The Wall timed out to everything. Synchronisity.
