				Fellow SR&#039;iance&nbsp; :)<br /><br />About five years ago, was offered by a friend a line (half a point) of &quot;dead ant&quot;.&nbsp; ? <br />-Texture was like slightly wet brown sugar<br />-Smell STRONG<br />-After snorting, burns a lot and makes the eyes tier!!!<br />-15/25 minutes later if you were sitting down, = you get up. And just want to do chin-ups! (thats what I did coz there was a bar setup haha) <br />Now I was in my prime years going through a lot of MDMA/Crack/Dexies....you name it...party and party some more...tolerance weren&#039;t week basically ;DD<br />And still to this day I remember it very clear and rekon that was the maddest shit going... Apparently filtered from Ephedrine containing medicines.<br /><br />In Australia easily recognized as Dead Ant. Have not heard of it being available since... <br /><br />Can anyone allow me to pick their brain on this? ;P <br />Did have a lazy search on the www but didn&#039;t get further than &quot;School kids collecting dead ants in a jar&quot; lmao.<br /><br />Peace!~&nbsp;

				Its meth mate.<br /><br />I remember this and another brown stim I used to get back in the day. Both rocked my world and gave that &#039;gotta go do something&#039; feeling which worked wonders for me at the time with the bar work/door work I was playing at a couple local clubs/pubs. The other stuff had these little black balls in it and you rolled your bic lighter or whatever over the bag to pop them and mix it all up.. shit was off the charts I remember. Shame that the guy who was cooking them up got sent on a holiday that he never survived.. I have actually put a fair chunk of thought into why they where so strong yet so &#039;dirty&#039;.. the balls one is one thing as it was just amph so more hard and fast but not as long in the legs but that meth was stupid strong and dirty as hell.. not convinced it was a tolerance thing as I was getting amongst it a hell of a lot more then than now. I actually think the dude had some secret recipe for them which was lost when he was.. who knows?<br /><br />FYI.... Called dead ant due to it closely resembling the ant poison &#039;ant sand&#039;.. well thats what I was told and sure enough it looks like it alright. May be a myth but it fits well enough! ;-P
