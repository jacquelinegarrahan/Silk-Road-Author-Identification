				I cannot say that has happened to me on MDMA alone, but it has definitely happened on MDMA plus Ketamine, and also on edible cannabis.&nbsp; It&#039;s kind of cool, actually, I liked it!&nbsp; It gave me the strangest feeling of not only being outside myself, but really, outside of Time.&nbsp; Super trippy.<br />

				Definitely not as much as I&#039;ve had it happen from DMT or K, but yeah to a certain extent I did.&nbsp; I was doing a LOT of MDMA for a few weeks when it happened and I was always smoking pot so not sure if that helped it a bit.&nbsp; I know MDMA has hallucinogenic properties but I don&#039;t know about dissociative ones...

				Did you have molly or a pill? MDMA has never had disassociative effects for me, so I wonder if it was adulterated.
