				I&#039;m Not really buying this whole thing really.. I think DPR was a lot smarter than that.. I think That if DPR Maybe just pushed this off on a setup fall guy.. Think about this there is always a fail guy. You know you are it and you play your roll.. I&#039;m just having a hard time thinking that is was a email account that did it. Plus if im running a Billion dollar drug website. I wouldn&#039;t do it from the USA. I would have Been somewhere else. It&#039;s kinda like this case i heard in my local news and child porno ring busted. These guys were setup to look like they were the people. So maybe somewhere in this world DPR lives... But im just thinking that its hard to believe what you hear.. Plus I&#039;m Sure there is a hacker out there. That can crack the site and get it back up and running and SAY FUCK YOU TO THE Government. This alll seems like Bullshit really. I guess time will tell the truth of this...<br /><br />Its their job to prove him Guilty... Cyber cases are hard and i bet they have a big long and very hard case to prove... <br /><br />i have horrible English skills... SO i get that. Let me know everyone thoughts on this

				I agree with you, a lot. <br /><br />something&#039;s, actually quite a few things, smell fishy in this whole case. could be a massive bluff/counter-bluff/either one of these gone sideways, at least partially. cant think of anyone even half intelligent as DPR (allegedly was, or whichever of the DPR &quot;versions&quot; out there we are referring to) ordering fake ID&#039;s to your home address... let alone talking openly and in writing, about &quot;taking care of&quot; individual human beings. some of what we have heard/read, may be true... and we know pretty damn well SR is down. but... is it down only because no one can fix it up and running, or... for some more trivial reason/s? if DPR was suckered in with 3.6 million dollars worth of BC... where is the rest of, what&#039;s that number again, something like 70-80 million? and a 100 more questions with no answers. <br /><br />fishy, is all.

				What control does the FBI over the site to post that bullshit on the URL? I&quot;m trying to figure this out... If someone is running a operation like this &quot;Cartel style Online site&quot; They wouldn&#039;t let just one person handle it all.. Its a Billion dollar company.... SO just like billion dollar real life companies. They do shady shit and get caught all the time. But that doesn&#039;t shut them down. I feel like maybe the real DPR was feeling a end to a good thing and turned over some avg computer person that might have helped with coding or whatever they say the link is. Shit if i had 80million in BTC then i wouldn&#039;t be in this country doing it.. I would pay off the right people and be in a place that would protect me. If you loook at the logo close it doesnt seem legit either. It could be something he setup in this case. With a direct link to a trail to someone on his team. Im just trying to put the piece of this together. <br /><br />Did the actual server or what the the site is hosted get hacked?<br /><br />Are they really going to get him on any charges?<br /><br />The money is the only thing i think will be the problem to explain.. IF he was smart as he is. That shouldn&#039;t be a issue.. We all know the money is the trail in anything like this..<br /><br />Plus if they let this go on for months and let people buy and sell and they bought and sold.. They really fucked up in a case with a good lawyer. or payoff the right people and he will have no problem. <br /><br />I have been on SR one week after it opened. Lost alot of money finding my legit and trust worthy vendors. Now it looks like its back to square one... <br /><br /><br />If anyone with legit advice what do you think the outcome of this case will be. DO you think they will be able to prove anything base of a email and him posting a code info?<br /><br /><br />Plus i don&#039;t believe that at all anyways.
