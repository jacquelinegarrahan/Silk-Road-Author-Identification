				71% of young men in America do not want to get married: <br />http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/young-men-and-women-differ-on-the-importance-of-a-successful-marriage/ <br /><br />Looks like feminism succeeded in destroying marriage. Now men refuse to get married. <br /><br />I hope all of you ladies have fun growing old alone with your ten cats.

				I think it&#039;s on both genders. Why would anyone want to get married? Can&#039;t there be a good relationship without a piece of paper endorsed by the state? In my experience women often change their attitude and their actions as soon as that marriage is final.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen them date a guy and want to fuck every night and love doing it but then when they get that paper and that&#039;s it for the sex. Some will still go once a week. Some husbands are lucky enough to earn it once a year!<br /><br />It&#039;s bull shit. I&#039;ve had it with females and their conniving trickery always wanting to control things. You can add me to that 71%. Don&#039;t get me wrong tho. I love females and couldn&#039;t be living with out them. I get along better with them then males. Most of the time they are more intelligent then most males and it&#039;s because they have to use their minds more to get shit done. They are very cunning but I&#039;m on to them.

				This could be accurate or completely off depending on the age cut off for &quot;young men&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m in college and certainly don&#039;t want to marry, but i&#039;m pretty sure all the guys approaching 30-35 that i know who are not married are feeling pretty anxious and regret a few (if not many) of their relationship decisions

If a man and a woman love each other, why do they need to sign some stupid legal paper with the government called the &quot;marriage contract&quot;?<br /><br />We need to STOP involving the government in our personal lives. Boycotting legal marriage would be a good first step. Also, we could put the family law lawyers out of business. My god, there is nothing more evil than family law lawyers, who PROFIT off of the destruction of families. Family law lawyers are all going to burn in the darkest pits of hell.

				A wife sould be sup-servant to here husband period. The man wears the belt and he is the leader of the house.<br /><br />I would like to get married but for religious reasons (lets not start a debate about that here now that not my point)<br />But I would never marry a woman how does not agree to be sup-servant to me.

				Marriage is just a made up societal ideal that use to be used as a business deal between two families. Human nature would tell us males to just go out and fuck as many different females as possible, females its your job to carefully select a suitable male who will give you the most security and offer the best living environment for your kids.

Now, I hope that women live up to their claims of independence and start paying their own bills, instead of being financially dependent on some man.<br /><br />Ladies, you claimed to be equal to men. Thus, stop expecting men to pay for you on dates. Since you are equal, split the costs of the bill 50/50. And, stop STEALING men&#039;s money through divorce, through child support/alimony, etc. If you women are so &quot;independent&quot;, why do you have to steal men&#039;s money? Why can&#039;t you work hard and make your own money? THEN you would TRULY be independent and EQUAL to men.

And, stop STEALING men&#039;s money through divorce, through child support/alimony, etc. If you women are so &quot;independent&quot;, why do you have to steal men&#039;s money?

				The thing that baffles me these days is the amount of men who are quite happy to live under the thumb of their women. Blokes who can&#039;t even go out the pub without running it past her who wears the trousers first. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that these men must actually enjoy living like that.

				That is a good reason that only men should wear pants with belt. Then the woman will always know who is the man in the house.<br /><br />I would never be able to live like that. <br />Maybe there just so afraid of not being able to get an other woman after this one.

				The sad truth is that most women know how to work men than vice versa. A pretty girl will always get exactly what she wants from a man. Dumb men clamour around good looking woman trying their hardest to please just because they think they might be in with a &#039;chance.&#039; Doesn&#039;t usually work the other way around as women aren&#039;t as stupid.

				&nbsp;;) You are correct about the Feminist agenda destroying marriage. There was a time when a man could earn enough to provide for himself, his wife, and God willing children. However, the Zionist-Red Sheild agenda has been to enslave the world. One vital piece of this plan was to get women into the work force and away from their children. Marriage is no longer an institute to produce children. It is a business partnership! When the business is no longer profitable $$ it dies. New business partnerships are sought after because, one business cannot survive alone. It used to be common law to be considered &quot;married&quot; if a man and a woman co-habited the same domicile for any length of time. Since the invention of &quot;social security numbers&quot; we are all slaves. Slaves cannot own property. Slaves cannot own children. Slaves cannot own a spouse. The King owns his slaves and that is that. No self determination. Not even the freedom to choose your own match.<br /><br />An interesting side note: Do you know the origins of the word &quot;FUCK&quot;. It is an acronym for Filed Under Carnal Knowledge. A long time ago some King decided his slaves needed to pay more taxes to His Crown. So, if a man were to sleep with a woman and DID NOT marry her (a marriage license is the same as paying tax to the king) he needed to pay a &quot;F.U.C.K&quot; tax. The tax receipt was displayed on the door where his whore lived so, he could fuck her and not have to worry about the kings soldiers dragging them away into the night to be tossed in a dungeon to die. Lovely huh?<br />

				I have no problems with men marrying a woman who they dearly love, respect and want to have children with. Marriage after all is only for children, nothing more.

				I&#039;ve haven&#039;t been to Sweden before so don&#039;t know the full extent of what its like there but since the article is highlighting points of law and Swedish social security I have no reason to doubt at least the basic facts of it.<br /><br />Apart from not having to go through child birth, PMT and being able to lift heavy objects easier are there really any advantages to being male in today&#039;s Western society? Because I&#039;m struggling to think of them. The vast majority of advantages are on the woman&#039;s side these days. Equal opportunities has gone too far the other way.<br /><br />Being a 20-30 something attractive female in my part of the world offers you more freedom and opens a lot of doors for you.

				Why buy the whole pig when you can get the sausage for free? ;D <br />As for my marriage my husband is sub to me and enjoys it immensely. You are looking at the overall perspective of what you perceive to be a feminist take over. You seem to be missing that some actually enjoy and thrive off a relationship where a woman rules. Some of you are taking pity for the males circumstance, has it ever occurred to you that it could possibly be exactly what they want in a relationship? As for the unmarried young ones they will have a change in perception as they get older and realize that they need someone in life.
