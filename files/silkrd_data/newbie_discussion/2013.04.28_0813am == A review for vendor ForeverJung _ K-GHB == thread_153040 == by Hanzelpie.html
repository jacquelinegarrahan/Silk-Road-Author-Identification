				Purchased a sample [S&amp;H cost only] and finally got a chance to indulge in it responsibly without obligations etc so since I cant post over in rumor mill yet I&#039;d figure I&#039;d post an in-depth endorsement here.<br /><br />This is only my 2nd time using GHB in any form so I don&#039;t have a frame of reference and my opinion is mostly subjective, however, being a male of a rather large body weight and using 1mL of a 50% K-GHB sample clearly it felt very unique compared to the dozens of benzodiazepines and even quaalude analogs I have used over the years -- presumably due to its affinity for GABA-b receptors. Based on that experience I say subjectively the 50% purity can be trusted. Its taste is very oily as is consistent with a buttery-like semi-solid GHB I ordered a year ago so makes sense the liquidifed form is oily. <br /><br />Without going into details that would aid relevant customs / USPS inspector service profiling I will say that this was by far the most discreetly packaged item I&#039;ve ever received -- and keep in mind this is a liquid product in glass something bulky and not as easy to conceal as a gram or less or powder or even tablets. I can say for certain that based on what I know I can say that not even the keenest eye would suspect the contents -- they most likely wouldnt show upn so easily if at all as glass bottles on the screen [and I have no first hand knowledge with this, just knowledge of how cargo inspection radiography works and canine detection] Further. based on the several layers and methodology, I would be shocked if canines would ever indicate suspicion on these shipments :) <br /><br />I can tell subjectively if a compound is hitting GABAa type receptor types more than GABAb and benzos tend to hit Gaba-A much more than B, well the opposite is true of GHB -- and very few other compounds stimulate such a unique combo of DA release on top of GABA-b agonism [again, I must say I am not a clinical pharmacologist and I state this opinion based on personal indulgences of CNS hypnotic sedatives over the years, including dangerous convulsant ones analoguous to Methaqualone and lesser used Benzodiazepines like Phenazepam, &quot;OTC&quot; GABA-ergic agents like Phenibut, and Baclofen and I base these observations from a subjective point of view with my limited pharmacodynamic knowledge and years of consciousness experimentation with every drug class except deliriants [no thanks] -- unscheduled limited run &quot;Research chemicals&quot; and Scheduled ones alike. <br /><br />So in short, out of two GHB vendors -- one selling unspecified purity waxy/buttery GHB that was far weaker than Jung&#039;s [and more expensive] I recommend Jung&#039;s liquid K-GHB and though they are one of the bulkier items to receive, you need not worry about it getting detected based on my careful examination of each layer of packaging and how it obfuscates the contents. <br /><br />Not able to comment on any human growth hormone related effects that some GHB users seem to seek as I do not currently work out and so that point is moot lol but I say with all I know that he is the go to vendor for US buyers. The seller of the buttery GHB moved onto selling cannabis for awhile and disappeared months ago so I dont feel need to mention their nickname. lol. <br /><br />Also packed in a way where if a postal inspector shakes it around they wont hear glass bottles clinking around nor will the contents leak [i always check this for liquid items]. I have no faults to articulate on the packaging method. <br /><br />Anyway looking forward to being able to post these in the relevant threads in rumor mill once I accrue enough posts, but since it was a free sample less S&amp;H i wanted to post an elaborate review having enjoyed this powerful compound and being able to trust in someone&#039;s liquid GHB [something very rare from what I have read -- where over the years batches could vary wildly -- but i say these are definitely 50% as advertised and isnt some RC or benzo dissolved etc. it has that signature oily presence. Holding bottles up to light showed crystal clear liquid with no visible impurities. I ingested orally wiith a soft drink and effects hit you strong consistent with its widely known rapid peak as depicted on an erowid chart&#039;s dose-response curve.

				Nice review man. FJ is the man so I copied this into his review threads so others can see it. Hope you don&#039;t mind.

				Thank you so much for this review, Hanzelpie. I try to do absolutely everything I can to put the safety of my customers/others above all else. I very carefully measure the chemicals for each batch of GHB, and then allow ample time for the reaction to complete before testing the pH and then sampling it myself. I ALWAYS personally sample each batch of any drug I sell to ensure that it is of the same subjective quality as previous batches. Unfortunately, I have no other means available... besides the reviews of the people here, which seem to be overwhelmingly positive thus far. :)

				I just want to throw my hat in the ring and say it was a pleasure doing business with FJ, I ordered the 200ml of GHB and he threw in free samples of 2c-i and 2c-e.<br /><br />I tried the 2c-e last weekend. I took it in the AM and went hiking at a national forest. The visuals were mild but present. I have many many trips under my belt from both acid and shrooms, this chemical took a backseat to both but was awesome nonetheless. Besides, what can beat a good acid trip?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t got a chance to try the 2c-i yet but am looking forward to it.<br /><br />The ghb is fun but not what expected. For me it was nothing like benzos. Maybe because I was addicted to them for 4 years and the year it took me to get off of them was a hell ride that left my head pretty muddled, still suffer the occasional panic attack which sucks because before messing with klonopin i was always too cool for school, nothing could raddle me. I pray that one day that this gets better. Anyway, with the GHB anything under 5ml does very little for me and at 5ml-8ml (all I have done so far) there is no sedation, if anything it winds me up, puts me in a great mood and kind of throws off my balance. Kind of reminds me of rolling. <br /><br />I do have to say that the GHB made me nervous because it did come with a fairly strong chemical smell and from what I&#039;ve read this is usually indicative of gbl, not ghb and my liver is in no shape for that. But I trust FJ and trust it is what he says it is. Anybody else care to share their GHB experience?<br /><br />Anyways, thanks again FJ and keep up the good work!

				As I told someone in PM, I have always found the &quot;odorless/tasteless&quot; thing to be BS in regards to GHB. K-GHB in particular has a nasty licorice/soap/solvent aroma and flavor to me. Less salty than Na-GHB and more just nasty solvent funk.<br /><br />I make the GHB myself (using the Rhodium synthesis) from what appears to be very clean GBL, water and lab grade potassium hydroxide. I do not have access to an analytical lab, so I cannot ascertain the purity of the starting material, nor the finished product. My only means of quality control are 1.) making sure that the final pH is between 7-8 (which indicates no unreacted GBL, nor potassium hydroxide) and 2.) dosing myself with a standard 5mL at least once from each batch to make certain that the subjective effects are consistent. I want to be as honest with everyone as possible, and welcome any questions (though I just told you virtually everything I know) and all subjective assessments from those who try the stuff.<br /><br />Also of note: since I am making this myself, I can make the sodium form if there&#039;s much demand for it. I vastly prefer the potassium form (for the body high in particular, though dietary potassium is something most of us could stand to have more of anyway), but if enough people want it, well... sodium hydroxide is just as easy to come by. :)<br /><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />If my calculations are correct, then 5mL of this K-GHB solution (2.5 grams) should provide about 682mg of dietary potassium. Neat!

				See, that was kinda my experience, D3xalias. Also, I find that K-GHB gives me less nausea/ataxia compared with the sodium form, even when I slightly overdo it. I just kind of nod off instead of feeling sick...

				Hey, don&#039;t apologize! Always question things like the quality and source of what&#039;s going into your body. If the person supplying you with a drug is&nbsp; reluctant to tell you what they know about (or discuss in general) the quality/purity, that&#039;s a red flag I&#039;d say. I welcome all discussion about my products, as long as it is honest and fair. :)<br /><br />GHB + methylone is pretty amazing, IME. I&#039;m very curious to try it with regular MDMA and/or MDA as well, and will report on that very soon. ;)
