				Hi this my vendor listing that I used this last 3 months - I live in western europe -<br /><br />- Sulphate amphetamine vendors :<br /><br />&nbsp; *Powerade* -&nbsp; fast shipping but the product is less than 50% of purity and it come very wet mostly liquid with lot of solvent so poor quality<br /><br />&nbsp; *Premiumdutch* - Fast shipping I bought his &quot;60%&quot; gear come wet too but more less than Powerade&#039;s gear I don&#039;t think it&#039;s &quot;60%&quot; but really better than Powerade<br /><br />&nbsp; *CapeCrusader* still waiting for my order 20 days in transit but I have great hope with this one<br /><br />- Methamphetamine vendor :<br /><br />&nbsp; *MarijuanaIsMyMuse* 7 days&nbsp; from Canada product was really good !<br /><br />- Weed/Cannabis vendor :<br /><br />&nbsp; *Underground* fast shipping good weed even it s &quot;90% grit from amnesia&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; *Globalshipping* I bought his commercial pollen hash and I was really satisfy (I m a huge daily cannabis smoker more than 1g/day) it s a good hash for the day you re not mind blowing when you have to work -&nbsp; no cuting agent in - <br /><br />&nbsp; *SuperHighFly* I tried the ice-o-lator and it was really nice and strong (if you put to much on a joint) fast shipping - 1g is like you have 2g/3g of a good weed - it s in powder form not solid<br /><br />- Lsd vendor :<br /><br />&nbsp; *Janis* I tried his Ganesha dose at 117Âµ - it s clean lsd but I was used to trip in the late 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s - I have to eat 2 blotter to have a decent lsd experience (not as great as the old ohms, stawberry or bart simpson double drip)<br /><br /><br />That s all for now I hope It ll help you<br /><br />I have 24 years experience of party drugs (I don t use heroin and benzo only uppers and psychedelique)<br /><br />Sorry English is not my langage<br /><br />Peace Everybody<br />

				The Avenger&#039;s thread in Rumor Mill is great for finding and reviewing LSD vendors.
