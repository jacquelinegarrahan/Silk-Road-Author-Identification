				IMO he&#039;s guilty of using excessive force.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how anyone can deem his actions &quot;authorized&quot; force to protect himself or his property.&nbsp; Now, getting a jury to convict him of a crime, especially murder, has a very low chance, IMO.&nbsp;

				I think Zimmerman has some mental issues.&nbsp; The news stated he was continuously on &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; and called the police numerous times for minor problems, which to me means he was probably looking for trouble and poor Treyvon happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing he&#039;ll be found guilty.<br /><br />Of course Casey Anthony got away with it... So you never can tell these days! :o

				He&#039;s guilty of being a confrontational busybody, which unfortunately isn&#039;t a crime. <br /><br />He won&#039;t get convicted of murder and probably not manslaughter. <br /><br />Hopefully next time others will stay inside ready to protect their life and property,&nbsp; instead of going out into the neighborhood playing policeman.

				Guilty, but not murder 2.&nbsp; Probably manslaughter....which carries up to 15 years in prison.....where he will most likely become somebody&#039;s bitch!&nbsp; If he wasn&#039;t packing heat that night, he would have never gotten out of his truck!

				DA brought charges because of community pressure probably knowing full well the prosecution couldn&#039;t make a decent case. The Zimmerman defense team was so confident that they skipped the &quot;stand your ground&quot; hearing which would have lead to charges being dropped against him. <br /><br />Who instigated the event doesn&#039;t factor into it. All that matters in Florida law is if Zimmerman felt that the use of deadly force was justified in order to prevent serious bodily injury. That doctor who testified and proved that Martin was on top at the time of the shooting pretty much sealed the deal for Zimmerman getting off. Zimmerman went from being the instigator (which doesn&#039;t matter in Florida) to being the victim once it was proved that Martin was on top. That whole GSR, shirt hanging off body if a guy is bent over and not clinging to body as if he were on his back, testimony. That&#039;s the kind of stuff Juries eat up. Very CSI like stuff. <br /><br />The screams for help heard on the 911 tapes doesn&#039;t matter and became moot when both mothers claimed it was their son. That was the dumbest thing the prosecution could have done. Calling mothers to a witness stand to testify who&#039;s son it is on the tape? Made the prosecution look like 1st year law school students. Even King Solomon knew better how to deal with two moms.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The jury will likely find him not guilty and there will be marches and maybe a few riots. But it can&#039;t be said Zim didn&#039;t have his day in court. Nor can it be said that the system failed. <br /><br />These DAs and prosecutors really fuck up big time once a camera is in the court room. When are they going to learn? Stop trying these media hyped cases with weak ass evidence and hearsay. Science bitches. Science. Use it or lose it.

				He&#039;ll walk free.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I think he was whack for picking a fight with a teenager and then shooting him (in the heart!!!) once he realized he was getting his ass kicked.<br /><br />F-ckin p-ssy.

				No matter who followed who or anything else, there is only one fact the jury can legally consider. That&#039;s whether or not GZ had a right to defend himself agasint TM. They are NOT using the stand your ground law because people have been trying to say TM was standing his ground. Instead they are using standard self defense. No matter what Zimmerman said or whether or not he followed TM, TM did not have the right to turn a verbal altercations physically violent. Under standard self defense laws, GZ had a right to defend himself as long as he did not throw the first punch. I find the whole thing apalling and a young man being dead is never an outcome I want to see. I think people need to use their heads and not have neighborhood watches with armed patrols.&nbsp; They claim they didn&#039;t know he was armed, but I don&#039;t believe it. That being said, it seems like a clear case of self defense from the pictures of his head after the beating. I think he will get off and the riots will start immediately. No jury should be intimidated into putting this guy in prison when he did not start the physical altercation.

				Zimmerman is still alive, living it up on &quot;donations&quot; that are more than I am paying for my house&#039;s mortgage. <br /><br />Trayvon is dead. No doubt that he was shot and killed by Zimmerman. <br /><br />The topic is misleading. Is he guilty of what? Being an asshole with a bad temper?&nbsp; Yes. Taking advantage of a screwed up criminal injustice system overloaded with cases, ineptitude, incompetence, bigotry, and feudal attitudes about rehabilitation? Yes. Was it murder? Define murder. And not the state&#039;s definition. <br /><br />Then, what are the undisputed facts of the case? Not too many of those lying about, unattended by thieves and liars. What of the available information for public consumption are you going to choose to believe?<br /><br />Must be answered in complete sentences for full credit.
