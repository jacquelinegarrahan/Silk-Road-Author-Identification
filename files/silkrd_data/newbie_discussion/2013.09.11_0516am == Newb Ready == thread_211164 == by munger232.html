				So I have everything set to make my first purchase. Have Tor running smoothly, even picked out the goods and placed them in the cart. I also have bitcoins in my bitwallet ready to go as well. My question is how do I link my bitcoins that I have to Silkroad so I can finalize it. I have everything just need some last direction. Thanks.

				Click on account on the Road and it will show you your SR wallet address. Then wait an hour or two.

				I don&#039;t see the SR number. This might be due to this being my second login since I forgot my login a few months ago. I see options on the account page now, I can Click here to make Deposits then below that it says Withdraw and below that Send bitcoins. What would I do from this Account page? Everything still applies, have everything ready.

				There should be a SR bitcoin deposit address on your account page. Just send the bitcoins there using your wallet address and wait an hour or two like the other post says.

				what he said - study your wallet, find out how it sends money, grab the BTC address SR has given your account, paste it in the send tool, and send.<br /><br />I use Multibit - it&#039;s been easy.

				Ah HA! I see it. So which option would I do to send my bitcoins to this address? It says withdraw bitcoins, for this it gives bitcoin address then amount then PIN then the withdraw button, I am assuming this is where I put in my bitcoin address and info. Below it says send bitcoins to another member, then the same options with a send button.

				Alright so I just sent my bitcoins to the address provided on SR&#039;s deposit page via Bitcoin wallet. How long will it take to show up in my account on SR. It has been about half an hour. Do I need to do anything else?

				It might take more than 1.5 hours.<br /><br />BTW I like to move my bitcoins around a bit before sending them to my SR account. There are services for that (tumblers) or you can do it yourself.

I use a service called Bitcoin Fog. Basically, you open an account on Bitcoin Fog and send your Bitcoins to this Bitcoin Fog wallet. When Bitcoin Fog receives the Bitcoin it is added to their pool with your balance marked in your Bitcoin Fog account. Then you set up a withdrawal: tell Bitcoin Fog what wallet to send the Bitcoins to and how many Bitcoins. Then you tell Bitcoin Fog the period of time to send it, between 6 and 97 hours. You see, Bitcoin Fog anonymizes the Bitcoin trail by sending Bitcoins in random amounts at random times within a set time frame until your requested total withdrawal is sent. Also, it charges a random fee between 1% and 3% to further anonymize. <br /><br />Pretty cool, I have used it once. It takes a little patience but you get some added security. Do some research yourself and see what you think.&nbsp; :)
