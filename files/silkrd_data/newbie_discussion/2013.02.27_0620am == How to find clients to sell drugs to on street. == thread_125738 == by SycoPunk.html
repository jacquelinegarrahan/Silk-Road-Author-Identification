				Ok! so im thinking about selling some drugs i get on the road on the street cuz i have a feeling if people knew what the drug was like theyd pay alot and i could make alot of profit. BUT how do i find customers? I literally just moved here and have no friends or job / aquaantences.. everyone ide go to / talk to I wouldnt know. Any ideas on how to find potential clients?

				First off, dont sell drugs on the street. Its stupid, and its how people go to jail. Start off drug dealing by getting to know some people who are into the scene, and then get one of them to start selling for you. So long as they aren&#039;t a junkie you can start out by giving it to them on tick, which allows you to earn good money for very little work. Then build up, get another dealer or two, start selling it in bulk. NEVER sell drugs on the street yourself.
