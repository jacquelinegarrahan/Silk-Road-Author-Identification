				I bought a bunch of methadone from a vendor and I can&#039;t seem to get high off it. It normally takes 50mg of roxys to get really high, i took 10mg of methadone and waited 1.5 hours, took another 10mg and waited an hour, took another 10mg and waited an hour and a half, took another 10mg about 3 hours ago and I barely feel anything. Thats 40MG over a period of 6.5 hours and I almost feel nothing. I kinda feel it... I feel as high as if i had taken 10MG of oxy and thats it. What gives? Also about 16 hours ago I did 40mg of oxy but it wore off a long time ago, could that have messed my tolerance for the day up? Why didnt 40mg of methadone do anything? They were M 57 71&#039;s and i chewed and swallowed them

				becoz it&#039;s very slow acting, taking at least 90mins to get even half into your system, you would have been best taking it all at once ... 30-40mgs should get you nicely bent with your tolerance<br /><br />for some one with no tolerance I&#039;s suggest starting with 20mgs<br /><br /><br />m m m motek

				Staplaytion3, you need to me a bit more careful.&nbsp; Methadone isn&#039;t like other opiates, it has a very long duration and it takes about 3 hours for it to hit its peak taken orally.<br /><br />What you have just done is how many users overdose on methadone.&nbsp; They take some, don&#039;t get high, then take some more.&nbsp; The problem is that methadone accumulates in your system and stays there for up to 36 hours.<br /><br />About the only thing saving you right now is the fact you already have a tolerance.<br /><br />The long duration is what makes methadone a perfect substitute for Heroin and other Opiate addictions.&nbsp; Once a user has determined their stable dose they only need to take it once a day.<br /><br />An H user taking 1g a day can get by feeling just fine on 40-60mg of methadone once a day.&nbsp; Someone who has never taken opiates before could actually die on just 10mg.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done them all, H and Oxy&#039;s of all types and Methadone.&nbsp; &nbsp;They only way you can take methadone and get an immediate high is via IV.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used MSeller&#039;s stuff that way and I usually take 40-100mgs IV&#039;d and get a nice rush, but unlike H I don&#039;t keep taking it.&nbsp; With H or Oxy&#039;s you can take some, then take some more an hour or so later without worrying too much about build up.<br /><br />The 40mg you took of methadone would have been better done all at once (and no more), you would have started to feel it at around 2-3 hours, but it wouldn&#039;t have been a major high, more a nice buzz and feeling good.<br /><br />The other thing is you need to be taking Methadone a few days in a row before getting the full benefits.&nbsp; Taken as a substitute to stop withdrawals it usually takes several days before that 40mg once a day actually lasts all day.&nbsp; When you go on a meth program they usually start you at 30 and bump it every 1-3 days until you are stable.<br /><br />

				ok im feelin bomb right now lol. ok this is the dealio. yesterday i took 40mg of methadone and barely felt shit! today i took 20mg at 5am, 25mg at 7am, 5mg at 8am and ok so 50mg and 4 hours later i finally feel pretty good, but not as good as i expected.. If i had to compare my high right now to oxy id say i feel like i took 40mg of oxy. why is it taking so much methadone? did i get old ones or something? i normally get mega high off 60mg oxy and this is my first time trying methadone. what do you guys think? Lol and is it normal to be in slow mode when high on methadone? XD

				well to reiterate what was already said-you would be much better off taking methadone all at once. for sure don&#039;t take any benzos with it-that is how most of the people i know who died from od did it(really advise mucho caution with any opiate and benzo combo). Anyway, methadone is not going to give you same feeling as oxy in my opinion.&nbsp; But you can certainly get truly fucked up on it. One of the first times I did it, I did like 20 mgs. and a few hours later I was &quot;sniffing my nuts&quot; as my not so ladylike friend likes to say-or would have been if i had any nuts lol. After years of&nbsp; opiate use I could do 120-130 mgs -and stay pleasantly fucked up for 2-3 days. So yeah the shit has major legs. My advice is to try somewhere around 30-40 mgs all at once, or at the most 50 but be careful and don&#039;t underestimate methadone. It can be a nightmare and a blessing-nightmare because some have alot of trouble weaning off it-I didn&#039;t for the record-and a blessing because when i was on methadone i could dose one day, and skip the next two-and not be sick-not feeling fabulous or anything-but not sick. Whereas with H, sometimes 6 hours after dosing i would be getting sick already. Sorry for the long post hope something one of us said helps.

				op your gonna kill yourself if you ain&#039;t careful, methadone is no joke shit. i&#039;d stop now if i were you, methadone don&#039;t get you that high anyway, its more useful to stop WDs from heroin. heroin users have a much higher tolerance than you got tho. especially shouldn&#039;t take them with other opiates or alcohol.

				Yea guys thanks for all your comments. I didnt take any more since the 50mg and I still feel really good. I didnt do too much :) yay! although i feel very close to the line lol. the only thing i think kinda sucks is it made me so sleepy. i mean WOW im tired! man im fking tired! ive never had any med make me go to sleep uncontrollably. its been 45tllkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkrkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk... oh snap lol, its been 4.5 hours since i last had any and i feel like the sleepiness is slowly passing. now heres my opinion on methadone. i dont think it gives a very good high. it really is just to kick an oxy habit like they say. taking so much of it made me more tired than it did high. it wasnt bad, it was similar to oxy, but it wasnt good enough to do again.
