				Havent seen L25 on the street for a looooong time. What is the average street price for 1 hit? I remember when it used to be 2 dollars-west coast (of course ;) 5 dollars midwest. <br />Can a person get 20 for one hit? Shit, I used to eat at least 10 at a time :o. I&#039;d have to be Billy Gates to do this now!<br />Obviously, I&#039;m looking to make a profit here...

				$10 a hit on the street in Canada, too. $5 a hit on the festival/tour circuit in the states, if you plan on getting more than 5 hits (which you do!).

				Holy shit, 20g?&nbsp; thats almost an ounce of boomers?&nbsp; All hail.... haha<br /><br />Tough to say since they&#039;re very different experiences and LSD quality per blotter varies much more than shrooms.&nbsp; For a trip that intense (if you really meant 20g&nbsp; ???) I&#039;d say, maybe 1000-1500ug?&nbsp; That&#039;d be around 3.5-4 of Tess&#039; blotter.<br /><br />Please be careful.&nbsp; Just because you have a large tolerance for mushrooms does not necessarily mean you will for LSD.&nbsp; Work your way up before trying this much!&nbsp; Lucy is not an easy girl and she will smack you if you don&#039;t treat her with respect&nbsp; ;)

				The price for 1 hit of LSD varies everywhere from $2-$20.<br />In Australia shit is more expensive since we&#039;re so far away from the rest of the world :(

Festival acid also seems to be weaker than city acid, but that might be because the stimulation of the festival diverts interest from within myself to outside it, allowing me to handle more doses. There is a lot of NBOMe being sold by people who really truly believe it&#039;s acid. Furthur shows are the easiest. You&#039;re also more likely to get good acid from people&#039;s personal stashes around the parking lot, rather than the rats on shakedown selling NBOMes and blank paper.

				Not too long ago there were some listings on the road from some canadian for about $1.40 a hit if you bought 25 sheets. Now it seems like $500 a sheet is the cheapest you&#039;ll find it. I believe the vendor was &quot;good for nothing&quot; but could have been someone else. Talked about just being a middleman between a dealer and SR on his profile. Shit, last summer there was a listing for a .1gr of L&nbsp; for super cheap.

				Haha I remember $3-$5 hits back in the day and the L was so damn good back then, 2 hits would floor me usually. Now you dont even know what the hell you are getting with all these new chems on the market with similar affects. But yea in answer to the question $10 is the usual going rate on the street these days in my neck of the woods.

				Whats the chance of getting some reasonably priced bulk listings? I don&#039;t want to pay $4 - $5 a hit if I&#039;m buying 1000 - 10,000 hits at a time.
