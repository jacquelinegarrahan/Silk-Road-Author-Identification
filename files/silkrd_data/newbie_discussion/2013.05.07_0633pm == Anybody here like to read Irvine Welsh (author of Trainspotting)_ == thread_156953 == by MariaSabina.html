				I think it&#039;s sad that most people, if they know about him at all, only know about the movie Trainspotting and just associate him with heroin addiction.<br /><br />He writes so eloquently about so many themes like the impact of statist neoliberal capitalist policies, the motivations for self-destructive behavior, the benefits of ecstasy use, the complications of tribal human nature, the consequences of past sins, and the insanity of male sexual desire, just to name a few.<br /><br />And he&#039;s such a great story teller.&nbsp; The world he creates is so rich and after reading a number of his books, because many characters keep showing up and various stories intertwine, it&#039;s almost like you know a little what it would be like to live and die in Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland.<br /><br />I think my favorite thing about him is that he just seems so honest, not really trying to hide anything.

I don&#039;t dislike his work. I loved Trainspotting and Acid House. I know he&#039;s written a fair few books since I last looked for him but it was Maribou that was the problem.<br /><br />It was brutal, pure horror. I do like horror writing and films etc but the pain and gore and sheer fucked up-ness of Maribou just did me in at the time I was reading it. It put me off reading Irvine Welsh in case the same thing happened again.<br /><br />Your thread has piqued my curiosity though and I think I&#039;ll revisit the guy&#039;s work. <br /><br />To answer your questions: I think his accuracy is great insofar as I&#039;ve read and Trainspotting is as bang on as you can get. My experience fits in nicely with much of what he put down in words.<br /><br /><br />Hope that&#039;s a bit clearer for you :)<br />

				Greetings one and all....<br /><br />Irvine Welsh: <br />Obviously, being a junkie, ive watched trainspotting, but havent read the book (yet!)<br /><br />I finished Skagboys about a month ago, which i couldnt put down... (after getting used to the language in which it was written) This is not a complaint, as it actually enhanced the atmosphere that the author was creating, (once id got my Rosetta Stone scottish language translator!)<br />This also had some parts which were hard to read (im not going to put them here, as they may be seen as &quot;spoilers&quot;)<br /><br /><br />And on the totally different end of the spectrum, im also a BIG fan of Andy McNab, i have read ALL his books fiction and non. (Apart from his Co-authored books which dont seem to have such appeal to me personally)<br />He is excellent at suspense, and descriptive writing. His Nick Stone series is a MUST READ for all army, special forces, spooks, MI5/6 spying fans etc. You know by his writing that he has been there, done that.<br />How he describes making a lock pick out of an electric toothbrush and an allen key, or using the parts of a cheap clock to bypass the sensor from a security light, are so descriptive.<br /><br />Along with Mcnab, i also read Chris Ryan, Duncan Falconer, and recently ive been getting into Lee Child (Jack Reacher) <br />A point id like to make about Reacher is that a 6&#039;5 man mountain should NOT be played in a film by TOM CRUISE!<br /><br />Anyway thanks for reading my &quot;book&quot; of a post...i look forward to hearing what everybody else reads on here.....<br /><br /><br />
