				If you don&#039;t use your real name, how would you expect to pick up your letter/package at the reception desk? I know at my school we get our letters placed into PO boxes that our for our rooms only, and if we get a package we have to show our school ID&#039;s, so I have to use my real name. I&#039;ve had a 100% success rate buying shit through my dorm. Think about it, your school gets letters/packages all the time for students, and you&#039;re ordering domestic. Use your real name, and everything should go smoothly.

				Yes use your real name. Just think &quot;camouflage&quot; and making everything blend in and seem normal. As long as you use a vendor with stealthy packaging if it has your real name on it nobody is going to think it&#039;s anything other than regular post. A letter with no name on however would stand out from the rest. There&#039;s quite a few threads on here explaining the importance of using real names.

				Yeah, using your real name seems to be the way to go. There&#039;s a much (much) higher chance of your package being held up because of a bogus name. Considering there&#039;s not much benefit in hiding your real name anyways, so long as you use PGP for addresses and deal with trusted sellers, it&#039;s kind of a no brainer.

				Don&#039;t use fake names either. Apparently this can sometimes set off alarm bells at the post office.<br /><br />I did once contemplate setting up a fake name myself. I was thinking about ordering loads of freebies online (legit stuff like beauty product samples etc) just to get the alias recognised at the post office and spammed about by companies before ordering drugs.<br /><br />But I chose to use my genuine details instead and I&#039;m glad to say I&#039;ve had no problems thus far. Hopefully that good luck will continue.

				The secret is to try and make it look like a real package is being delivered to avoid suspicion.. Having just the room number would have the package in one persons hands longer then needed by having the person look up who&#039;s in that room number, etc. By having all real info and much as possible the package is less likely of having anyone digging to much into it and you being abroad it would just look like a package from friends or family or you can try and rent out a P.O. Box?

				I think if you do the research to find out who packages &#039;stealthily&#039; and order small amounts you will be fine. <br />The primary thing and the thing more likely to &#039;get you&#039; is your receiving environment, if the police question you (unlikely) and you&#039;ve got bongs on the table, and you were using Windows (therefore there is evidence of complicity on the computer) it&#039;s not the act of ordering drugs so much as its the rest of your environment that gives you away. <br />Also, in some places if you are renting you will not have as many protections from your landlord cooperating with police that want a search warrant. A sneaky cop could maybe get in on a pretext (&#039;heard&#039; somebody scream, or &#039;saw&#039; drugs in plain view from the door/window) They can always get in with a &#039;welfare&#039; check for old people that the next door neighbor hasn&#039;t seen in 3 weeks.&nbsp;

				Use your real name&nbsp; and if intercepted, deny.&nbsp; The only way you can get in trouble if the tie the sale back to you, Thats why btc are here. I know in US you need evidence just can&#039;t arrest somebody with no evidence.&nbsp; If its in your car or purse or something i mean yeah but mail noway.&nbsp; In US never even gos to court.
