				You sound like a fuckin badass. This market is a bit different. It&#039;s main allure is that people don&#039;t have many connections in real life and instead can come here for an assortment of venders. That idea plays the biggest role on the fact that some things may be priced higher here just because in some cases, people wouldn&#039;t be able to find it at all.

				Yep they&#039;re insanely high.. I&#039;m guessing the quality is much better and hasn&#039;t been through 15 dealers after the source so it hasn&#039;t been cut as much.

No matter how pure someone says it is on the streets, for all you know you might be used to regularly getting only 10%-20% heroin.<br /><br />Only time I bought H it was 200 bucks for half a gram. That price would be ridiculous if it was impure, but the effects/dose ratio (or however you like to explain it) was exactly what erowid said pure heroin should be. And this is in a part of the country where it&#039;s hard to find a lot of people who do heroin, but when you find someone willing to experiment they won&#039;t be coming back if erowid says it&#039;s crap lol. At least with the people I hang out with, bad drugs don&#039;t sell well to us and therefore aren&#039;t really even available.

				IME the heroin I buy on the street is stronger than on the road but I have bought near the border and in the Northeast.&nbsp; It is just safer to not have face to face interaction with people paranoid and facing 30 years if they get caught with that ounce of smack and that piece on their hip.&nbsp; Heroin is cheaper in the hood also.
