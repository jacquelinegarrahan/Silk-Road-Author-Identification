				Yes, we are spending a lot of time preparing things. . . <br /><br />We will give out the freebees next week.&nbsp; We are hoping to use them wisely and totally bomb the threads with the free samples for one week straight. Watch for the hourly spot giveaways.&nbsp; We spot you on the forum and just hand you a free one out of the blue.&nbsp; &nbsp;How&#039;s that for marketing ?<br /><br />And as stated, anyone giving us mention in the threads gets on the list.<br />There are professional reviewers here as well. They all get one of course. <br /><br />If there is anyone I missed let us know. <br />

				Nice stuff.&nbsp; I think your prices could come down a bit though for grower direct.&nbsp; You growers always try to get too high price.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure it&#039;s well worth the price, but your sell more of it with a Lower price.

				Oh yes, it&#039;s going out Monday and forgot to update.<br />We had trouble ordering the shipping today anonymous, but got it now.<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s probably best not to sit over the weekend in the mail I think. <br />&nbsp;Sorry for the delay. It has extra in it though. !<br /><br />Thanks.
