				Anyone know if when we cancel we&#039;ll get back the same price of bitcoins (so less money) as before, or if the system takes into account price fluctuation in BTC? Thanks!

				I ordered 2g&#039;s of each wax...I really wanna vape those 6g&#039;s. They&#039;ve been processing since Thursday. I&#039;m gonna try to hold out and hopefully he comes back. I wish I could get some kind of a return on my messages.&nbsp; I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed, Festival gave a great review and I&#039;m dying for this order to say shipping

				Yeah I&#039;m in the same boat...have an order processing since Thursday..no reply to (or even read) messages..<br /><br />Though looking at their profile on SR just now they added back all their stock.&nbsp; So something is going on.

				Good News Everyone!<br /><br />theDankBank has re-posted his wares on his page. I also read on another post that he has began messaging some buyers and even shipped a few orders. I dont think mine is shipped yet but I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed, I cant wait to dab it up. I went and got a new bell and plate and a micro g prepping for that wax

				More Good News Everyone!<br /><br />The DankBank sent me a message today, guaranteeing that my order will be sent out by Monday, I&#039;m sure he was swamped with the crash and his great reviews with the low price point. I&#039;ll update if it was worth the wait&nbsp;

				I ordered a DabR wax pen and it was put in transit a week (7 days) ago.&nbsp; This is a domestic order which usually take 2-3 business days to reach me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the deal is but my order has been very slow in arriving.&nbsp; I messaged theDANKBANK with my concerns.&nbsp; I also saw that his number has dropped to 96, what&#039;s the deal with that?

				so theDANKBANK fessed up and said he didn&#039;t actually ship when he marked in transit.&nbsp; he promised to ship by the end of the day today and give me a dcn.&nbsp; end of the day passes and no dcn yet.&nbsp; so far a very disappointing experience.

				Dammnit, vendors with little to no communication scare me. Luckily he doesn&#039;t require FE. But I hope my order is actually in transit cause I&#039;m over here anxious until it arrives!

				Well, didn&#039;t come in yesterday. And no surprise it didn&#039;t come in today either. Slowest shipping service I&#039;ve experienced on the road, and no communication what so ever. I&#039;m most certainly not going to purchase from him again, I&#039;ll take my business elsewhere. I can only hope its here by monday.

				Nothing came in today, so I sent him another message on SR hoping he gets time to actually fucking respond. This whole situation is frustrating because he won&#039;t even take 1 minute to tell me if he&#039;s even sent it out or not. I&#039;ve been waiting 6 days now, and frankly I don&#039;t expect it to even get here. I&#039;m definitely taking it to resolve once 10 days are up.
