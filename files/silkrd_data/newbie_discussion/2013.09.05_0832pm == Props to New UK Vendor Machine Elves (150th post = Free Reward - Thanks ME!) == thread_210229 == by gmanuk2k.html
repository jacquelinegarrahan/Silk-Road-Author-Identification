				Hi Fellow Noobs,<br /><br />Apart from the usual weed, mdma and coke....<br /><br />&quot;The Spice&quot; has always been my thing. I used to make it myself but got sick and tired of the lengthy/costly and sometimes unpredictable outcomes i ended up getting.....mostly goo.<br /><br />Since SR launched, I began purchasing DMT from all of the UK domestic DMT vendors (current and past) and their product has always been (mostly) very very good indeed! - No real complaints ever, always 5/5 ratings given.<br /><br />That said,&nbsp; I have just finished sampling the &quot;Machine Elves&quot; DMT with a couple of my experienced friends Tuesday night past and I can HONESTLY say that this stuff is in a **COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEAGUE** altogether.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would rate 10/5 if it was possible&nbsp; :) (No Joke!)<br /><br />The instant smile that coursed through my body after just one toke was utterly indescribable.....after the next 2 (or was it 3!!) I was immediately jettisoned from my body and blissfully traveling through space and time, at will.&nbsp; &nbsp;Never before have I (with my eyes fully closed) seen with such clarity, winged beings, indescribable translucent architecture and the feeling of connectedness/oneness was supreme and extremely real in every way.<br /><br />The experience lasted full on for at least 12-15 minutes (although at times it felt like forever) and left me.....literally speechless, with my jaw dropped wide open comedy style, just like you see on an exaggerated cartoon character!!&nbsp; <br /><br />***ABSOLUTELY ROCKING STUFF***<br /><br />As they state on their profile, they produce VERY POTENT DMT with their &quot;own particular process&quot; and I have to agree that whatever those Elves are doing....it certainly DOES make a huge difference.&nbsp; Definitely for the experienced as this stuff took me and my buddies beyond anything we had ever encountered previously.<br /><br />MASSIVE PROPS to this new Vendor and will be ordering again asap.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you like your DMT, you must try this just in case it gone all too quickly!<br /><br />** GREAT TO SEE A NEW HONEST AND TRUSTWORTHY VENDOR WHO CARES ABOUT HIS BUYERS AND ESPECIALLY THEIR PRODUCT **<br /><br />PS - Drop them a message they are excellent communicators and seem to take pride in what they do.<br /><br />Their store link is : http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/7076c26b1e<br /><br />Sorry for rambling on, me and my buddies are still in complete awe from Tuesday night......long live the Silk Road!!&nbsp; 8) 8)<br /><br />LIBERTY!!!!

				Hi Gmanuk2k,<br /><br />I Agree 100% Completely! <br /><br />Really Great Vendor who answered all (and I had lots!) of my questions immediately.<br /><br />I ordered 250mg not long ago&nbsp; (Next Day Delivery / Great Stealth) and it absolutely blew my mindset/worldview.<br /><br />I am ordering again very very soon.<br /><br />I love Silk Road!&nbsp; 8)<br />

				** group hug **<br /><br />I&#039;m sat here, wishing my life had taken me deeper down the psychedelic route than mere acid tabs and shrooms (and those were decades ago, literally).<br /><br />Sadly, I can&#039;t think of how stuff as amazing sounding as DMT could fit into my life, what with my RL commitments and lack of &quot;me time&quot;.<br /><br />wishing...<br /><br />

				M.E: I love your responses - thorough, descriptive and reassuring.<br /><br />Next weekend I&#039;m dropping a public Blue Superman in public with a long-time&nbsp; friend (we popped pills together in the early 90&#039;s). My wife and kinds will be out of the house when we get back from our fun and frolics. Several beers may well have been drunk in the process.<br /><br />Feels to me like a&nbsp; DMT opportunity when we get back to an empty house.<br /><br />I&#039;m tempted to talk to him about it during our MDMA experience, have a few drinks in town, then try the DMT when we return to my empty house (empty apart from dog).<br /><br />Sound viable, considering I&#039;m a family man again a few (4 to 10) hours later?<br /><br />Sorry to ask so many questions, but I&#039;m fully aware that these things can be critical to enjoyment and repeat potential...

				Hi Feesh,<br /><br />Sounds like a grand plan - an empty house with a close friend is absolutely ideal and I am sure that your mindset will be just in the right place in that setting.<br /><br />We have taken DMT after a night on MDMA and so long as you are taking the DMT later on once the peak has past and you are at that happy chatty stage it will be utterly fabulous.&nbsp; <br /><br />The afterglow of a nice MDMA buzz helps quell the anxiety of taking the DMT and will give you the ability to confidently take the 3 hits required to breakthrough without any worries&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D ;<br /><br />The one thing I would say is don&#039;t overdo the beers too much, I would not recommend any more than 2-3 maximum to ensure it does not impair the effects.<br /><br />Sounds like a great night ahead, we wish we could join you!!<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES&nbsp; <br />

				Never tried DMT- don&#039;t have the apparatus to smoke it. Nor can I afford a special bong for the stuff. Is it possible to insufflate? Good/bad idea? I still feel like I have more to learn with acid and shrooms. The psilocybin in mushrooms is very structurally similar to DMT, I&#039;ve heard

Hopefully, he&#039;ll stay convinced until next time!<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for tomorrow, actually; my 1st MDMA in many years (only done it the odd time since I was a mad clubber in the early to late 90&#039;s). And always enjoyed more in the company of a good friend (known each other for, let me see... geez... 26 years now!!! Makes me feel old.

				Hiaya Feesh (all all other who have posted!),<br /><br />Really nice to hear from you again!!<br /><br />Remember not to pressurize your friend into taking DMT too much if he is &quot;Not Ready&quot; ......not that I think you would&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />DMT is absolutely NOTHING like ANY other psychedelic and should be more compared to an extremely strong / quick shortcut to a very deep meditation and visit to &quot;Nirvana&quot;.&nbsp; It is a lot to take in when trying to blast off and then often tricky to try re-integrate the experience on returning to our normal realm :)<br /><br />Having said all of the above it&#039;s not in any way scary, just intense!!<br /><br />Re your MDMA night, have a fantastic time!! - You sound around the same age as us Elves (experienced, not old!!) and we have consumed some very nice/strong pure MDMA at several Music Festivals having the time of our lives!, as I am sure you and your buddy will!!!!&nbsp; 8) 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />ENJOY!! and you could perhaps even post back here with your experience&nbsp; ;D ;D<br /><br />Have a awesome time and enjoy every second!!! - Life in the moment :)<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				hello friends :),<br />question: how discouraged would a xanax be for a dmt trip? never done it, looking to do it for the first time soon. will definitely take a couple of 20mg hits some days prior to attempting breakthrough to test the waters(already have it the substance, but wont attempt breakthrough until maybe next month when i can do it with a friend).<br />i have recently began practicing meditation in order to promote &#039;freeing my mind&#039;, which i feel can be very controlling. my goal is to come as prepared as i can (which i know is not much) for the experience. thanks :)<br />good vibes to all.<br />LL

				LondonLondon,<br /><br />Good to hear from you.<br /><br />Personally from our diverse experiences with people and DMT, we would definitely discourage you from taking Xanax BEFORE doing your DMT journey - We say this because we wish you to experience the full pleasure of it.<br /><br />(Are you taking Xanax, to try to calm down before &quot;going for it?&quot;)<br /><br />One of the things we have found people report whilst trying DMT on decent levels of alcohol, valium, SSRI&#039;s, Xanax and Cocaine is that there is a definite period at the start of DMT blast off, where the DMT &quot;seems&quot; to really want to get your mind back to an &quot;absolute level&quot; before allowing you to breakthrough properly to the DMT realm....The effect is COMPLETELY determined on how heavily effected your mind is by other substances, at the time before launch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically with DMT you want to be as clean as possible of anything else (Weed is the exception here and LSD for the experienced ;) ) before blasting off.<br /><br />We have &quot;broken through&quot; no problems after a couple of bottles of beer and a smoke of weed, but its a different story when your &quot;too far gone&quot;.&nbsp; Moderation is everything, but for DMT abstaining is THE BEST.<br /><br />Save the Xanax for afterwards, might help you when you are trying to come to terms with the miracles you have just witnessed!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />PLEASE REMEMBER<br /><br />Being nervous is absolutely normal and even a &quot;little fear&quot; is completely fine......we still get the &quot;butterflies&quot; if we haven&#039;t gone home for a while.<br /><br />No preparation will EVER really make you ready for your first breakthrough.....<br /><br />Although we DO love the fact you are practicing meditation.<br /><br />THAT is exactly the experience most likely to help prepare you to just &quot;go with it, eyes closed and relaxed&quot;.<br /><br />Your minds &quot;set and setting&quot; are just as important as the location and who you take it with.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you enjoy meditation, think of DMT like that on steroids + aliens&nbsp; 8) 8) <br /><br />For us, it was never scary (felt strangely natural), just jaw-droppingly the most incredible, indescribable and amazing experience ever - a true instant link for YOU to THE DMT realm.<br /><br />Our advice:<br /><br />Just be completely prepared once you get to doing the big dose, we would recommend 60mg and to REALLY go for it......<br /><br />It starts to feel amazing after the first 10 seconds believe us&nbsp; ;D , but that&#039;s partly the problem, after your 2nd toke you will feel quite unreal/disoriented and see &quot;so much stuff&quot; that you think you are done and have had enough.........you have NOT - KEEP GOING!!!!!!!! <br /><br />You MUST, absolutely MUST (sitters REALLY help here) have a 3rd (or more if possible) toke to make damn sure that your gonna make it through to the other side!<br /><br />You will feel an urge to sit back and close your eyes....GO WITH IT AND STAY THERE, eyes shut is best.<br /><br />Once you have &quot;broken through&quot;, you will never harbor the same apprehension and will learn to inhale deeper, hold longer and generally find the process much easier.<br /><br />As it happens, the more you take DMT the easier it becomes to breakthrough and the less you need!<br /><br />Good Vibes right back at you LL.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				Greetings and Salutations OP, Machine Elves, and any others who may be lurking about. This is my conundrum: I have damaged lungs from working in electronic manufacturing for waaaay too many years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Every time I have attempted smoking DMT it has resulted in me coughing, tears streaming from my eyes, my nose a faucet. <br /><br />I am a spirit having a human experience, as we all are. YES, this means you too. I can smoke pot, meth, coke, even small amounts of tobacco, without coughing, choking, gasping for one last fell breath....(dramatic, right)...I am desirous of the DMT experience, but am leery of attempting it again. Just recently acquired a bit, 250mg, and still, I sound like a tb victim or one of my cats urking up a hair ball. <br /><br />Are there any other roi that don&#039;t require me to inhale the vapor or smoke?&nbsp; I would very much appreciate your feedback, and this seemed like a good place for my inquiry.<br /><br />I appreciate the effort required to extract and refine DMT, as I respect artists for their skills and craftsmanship.<br /><br />Oh, and then there is this: When my soul-family is having their consciousness expanded, and I have just once again coughed my tits off, unable to cross over my threshold, I do get a bit jealous.

				Have you tried Changa or Pharmahuasca?&nbsp; That may be a better way for you to smoke it.<br /><br />To be honest though, our DMT is not heavy on the lungs at all.....only ever had a person cough once....and he was a non smoker anyways.<br /><br />I have a theory that he DMT Fressbase you are receiving has been extracted with heat (which allows Vendor&#039;s / Sellers) to get more product for the same effort.&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem with this unless it has been washed and re-crystalised, it will be full of plant oils and tannins.<br /><br />I gues its the oils and tannins which are causing you to cough and not the DMT Itself.<br /><br />We can offer you a special small 100mg bag? just so you can try ours to see if you find it easier to &quot;hold&quot;.<br /><br />If that doesnt work, we can provide (although we do NOT advertise this, Elf-Changa which would totally get you there after a joint or two to yours&quot;elf&quot;.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; Its a slower come up, but it IS accumulative......so have 3 or for pre-rolled and and do them one after another until you hit the spot&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />We also do &quot;Enhanced Leaf&quot; which is simply cannabis infused with DMT......usually the ration is 500mg DMT to 1/2g of weed.<br /><br />You can also try smoking the Changa and Enhanced Leaf in a LARGE bong, rather than joints, if that&#039;s what works for you.<br /><br />Lastly, you might consider taking Syrian Rue or Cappi Vine tea (MAIO inhibitors), around 30mins prior to just swallowing the DMT Freebase.<br /><br />You have many many options my friend....... 8) 8) 8)<br /><br />The DMT Realm is off limits to NO-ONE.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES<br /><br />
