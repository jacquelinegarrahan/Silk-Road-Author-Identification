				Since nubs cant post in any forum other than the newbie section. I thought it would be cool to have a newbie trip rerport thread so we can share our stories.&nbsp; I came up with the idea while tripping on some shrooms. <br /><br />last night my girlfriend and I tripped on some shrooms. 3 days prior we both tripped on half an eighth(1.75g) . The tripped lasted 4 hours so we upped the dosage. I ate 2.5g and she ate 3.5g. I ingested my mushrooms with water while she decided to put it on peanut butter and bread. after eating them we both felt minor nausea but no one puked. The trip kicked in very fast. my brain started to feel numb. We decided to take a shower which was by far one of the most relaxing showers I have ever taken. I just stood motionless in the warm water while the walls started to pulsate. I got out the shower before my girl, dried up, and got dress. After which the tripped kicked in hard core. The floor has this somewhat floral pattern which began to dance in front of my eyes. They were swirling and circling around each other as the walls started to breath rapidly and i was like damn. <br /><br />My girlfriend just got out of the shower and got dressed. We then lit candles and began to cuddle and this is when I began to peak. I felt the world begin to sway and tip upwards. some what like, up was becoming down and down was becoming up while the roof began to slowly fall very slowly as if it were going to crush me. I turn to look at my girlfriend and we bust out laughing. I then hug her and close my eyes for some intense closed eyes visuals. from that point on it gets hard to describe. I began see on red and my entire body felt like a sphere I cant say i felt my body but it felt like my being was a sphere of energy. I then open my eyes coming back to reality some what. The peak started about hour and half after eating the shrooms and I dont know how long it lasted. I was tripping to hard and time perception was off. After the peak i was still tripping for bout 4 hours. It was very clean and reminded me of and acid trip minus the anxiety and super mind fuck. I don&#039;t know why but i get anxiety when i do acid. The shrooms were super relaxing. After the trip was over we got to sleep. It was somewhat difficult, but after a lot of tossing and turning we were able to get sleep and stay asleep. Overall the trip was an 11/10. It was by far the most psychedelic experience I have ever had.&nbsp; Also 2.5g was the most shrooms i&#039;ve eaten in one go.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				Awesome to hear mate. Sounds like you had an awesome night.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I think being high on most substances and showering feel amazing. I&#039;m sure having company is even better. I once took a shower after bk-MDMA hit, and wow best shower ever! I really enjoyed your trip story, as I love to hear others experience. Have you ever tried DMT the spirit molecule? If not I highly suggest it. <br /><br />-Cheers
