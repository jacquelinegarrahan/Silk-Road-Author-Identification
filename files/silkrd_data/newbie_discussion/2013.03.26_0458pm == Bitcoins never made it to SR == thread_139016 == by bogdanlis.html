				All,<br /><br />Help!!! I sent money via bitinstant yesterday during the outage to my btc address but it never showed up at SR. I&#039;ve done this before with no problem. My bitinstant transaction email told me to check blockchain.info, but I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t understand the transaction logs there. How can I find out where my bitcoins went?<br />

				Go to blockchain.info and enter your btc deposit address in the search field.&nbsp; It should then show a page that shows a green transaction coming into the address.

				Again, sometimes there are delays, but if you haven&#039;t received them within 12 hours, send SR Support a message on the main site.

				Scout is right, you&#039;ll be fine it has happened to all of us...<br /><br />Our BTC is getting quite popular since the halving-party and Cyprian ordeal.

				It&#039;s always scary to see the coin tumbler in action for the first time!&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; Rest assured though, that is all it is.&nbsp; As for not having receiving the deposit to your SR wallet yet, that is just due to site-wide delays.&nbsp; So definitely send SR Support a message on the main site and know that they WILL get to it and you WILL see your coins.&nbsp; :)

				There&#039;s nothing more I can tell you - we can&#039;t do anything from our end on the forums here, so you&#039;ll either need to be patient and trust that your coins will show up when they get to your complaint, or message them again but realize sending multiple messages isn&#039;t going to get their attention any sooner --- there are a lot of things that need to be dealt with, and they do so as soon as they are able to.
