				Hi I&#039;m new to this whole thing, and I was wondering if someone could walk me through transferring Bitcoins into my SR account. I just bought my first bitcoins using CoinBase, and my coins will be available tomorrow around noon. I would like to learn how to do this before tomorrow so I know exactly what I&#039;m doing. Any help would be appreciated.<br />Sorry I&#039;m sure this is a dumb question, but I&#039;m a virgin to this whole experience and sometimes you have to be guided in&nbsp; ;D

				On Silkroad go to your account and copy the address, people recommend hitting the get new address button first-can sometimes make the transfer quicker. Don&#039;t miss out any letters/numbers!<br /><br />On coinbase I&#039;d assume there is a &#039;send funds button&#039;, hit that, add the amount and paste your silkroad address into the recipient box. Wait a few hours.<br /><br />You could send the coins through a laundering service but I wouldn&#039;t bother, Silkroad has one built in.<br /><br />Don&#039;t forget to encrypt your delivery address when you order!

				It might be wiser to transfer your coins into your own downloaded wallet first, then from there to SR. It helps to &quot;rinse&quot; the coins. <br /><br />You can get one here (clearnet) http://www.weusecoins.com/en/getting-started or here http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet

Fingerprinting will relate more to whats posted on forums.<br /><br />Astor has written this guide to PGP http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion/gpg4usb/ I imagine this&#039;ll help somewhat.

				thanks tiger, that guide helped out quite a bit. There&#039;s still a few things I&#039;m confused on though. Using the GPG4USB software I generated keys, but which one is public and which one is private? I would assume the one you had to give a passsword and email address would be your private key, but I&#039;m not sure. And if that key was the private one, does it give you a public one as well? Idk lol, this is all very new to me

				I don&#039;t use that program so I&#039;d probably want someone to confirm this. <br /><br />When you generate a key, you actually generate a keypair- the public and private key. These are different but are linked (you need the private key to unlock message encrypted with that public key). You would only need to generate a key once. <br /><br />&quot;To copy your public key, so you can give it to other people, open the Key Management window and check the box next to your key, then select &quot;Export to Clipboard&quot;. &quot; <br /><br />That will give you your public key, don&#039;t worry about getting your private key-you don&#039;t want to be sharing that. GPG4USB will sort the private key bit automatically when you go to decrypt a message.
