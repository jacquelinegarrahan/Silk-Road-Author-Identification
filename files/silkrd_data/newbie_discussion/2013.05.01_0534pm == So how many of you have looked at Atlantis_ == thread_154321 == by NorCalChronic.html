				I don&#039;t really think SR will be shutting down anytime soon tbh. However... let&#039;s just say it did. Something else would crop up, probably owned or formed by DPR and his crew. It&#039;s something that they know and have done before so It&#039;s only natural that they would do it again. Long live SR!

				its another site that does the same thing as SR. I looked at it couple of days ago, not as many listings. All I can say is it loaded quick. But SR has been very good to me and I hope it still will for a long time, at least long enough to save $ to buy a condo in Cabo....LOL

				&nbsp;[CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion for the curious.&nbsp; I like that it takes litecoins in addition to bitcoins, but I haven&#039;t placed an order with anyone yet.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t many reviews for products or vendors yet because it is so new, but everything is done in escrow, so it seems worth trying if SR doesn&#039;t come back soon.

				I dunno why everyone is so worked up about Atlantis. BMR has been around a lot longer, technically they are the main rival. In-fact, some SR vendors have recently started distributing on BMR, with the promise of returning once all the hoopla calms down.<br /><br />I had a look at Atlantis. Not fussed either way tbh. Got no reason to give them my trade, so I won&#039;t.<br /><br />SR will endure. I&#039;m sure of it.

				Yeah it does look &#039;clunky&#039;. I can&#039;t stand the site&#039;s design, (aside from lacking any actual passion) it screams &#039;corporation&#039; to me more than &#039;hey, this is a safe place to buy your chems&#039;.<br /><br />I went through some listings, the H is almost the same on both sites, DMT is at a reasonable price, so I guess that&#039;s cool.<br /><br />Competition could be a good thing for anonymous market places. It could potentiate a need for improvement in areas that were previously overlooked as unimportant, like the design.<br /><br />i seriously hope that not everyone would migrate to that site, but diversity and competition amongst business is a good thing.

				They copied a great deal from SR. Someone shared the link above, but I was under the impression we shouldn&#039;t post it. Personally, SR has been GREAT to me. So many trusted vendors and a great community. It has taken me a long time to feel comfortable ordering and trusting this site in general. I see no reason to leave and I hope many of you agree. I&#039;m all for competition, but I prefer to stick with those I trust (which is tough in this business!).<br /><br />I&#039;ve had over 50 transactions on SR and spent over $6k. I&#039;ve only had one order not arrive and was given a 50% refund (came to about $30). I thank this community for a great deal of that success bc so many shared their experiences and of course bc there are some truly good vendors on SR.<br /><br />Just my opinion of course....As long as SR is here, I&#039;m stayin.&nbsp; 8)

				yes, I love the road. And there is a lot that a site like &#039;atlantis&#039; would have to do to truly replace it, even in an outage. Eventually you acquire a familiarity for TOR and the road that you become comfortable with. Needless to say, if I couldn&#039;t get H from the road, I would be next to forced to acquire it from another source (preferably with coins) which I would, with little argument, oh well.<br /><br />i was trying to get H today, except i forgot my pin so my account is locked temporarily, and my wallet is in the process of reindexing (if you keep a bitcoin wallet on an external drive, do not break connection with that drive while the application is running, its not the end of the world, but a huge pain in the ass).<br /><br />also this dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151987.0<br /><br />i&#039;d give a few btc (2.12 is what I both have and am willing to donate) to whoever could put a permanent stop to the recent DDOS attacks on the silk road (by permanent stop I mean pineapples, and by pineapples I mean kill whoever is operating the computers or botnet that the attacks are originating from, pineapples).

				Atlantis is like that stuck up hot bitch you went to high school with. Nice to look at, but has no soul or substance. She might give you some attention, but it&#039;s only cause she&#039;s a filthy golddigger. On the other hand, SR is the cute modest chick thats girlfriend material. Will always be by your side even through the worst of it and even plays with your balls while sucking you off :)

				I&#039;m not sure when Atlantis first started showing up, but I think it is still very untested and I dont trust it.<br /><br />YET.<br /><br />There&#039;s no reason another marketplace couldn&#039;t be just as great as SR.&nbsp; And that would certainly spread out the attention of Johnny Law, but I&#039;m not comfortable until a community of successful buyers and vendors has been established in the forums over there.&nbsp; The next few months will tell.

				I signed up a couple weeks before SR went down, and have been watching a vendor selling BHO and edibles build up 17 positive ratings and seems to be offering a really decent product with cheap shipping.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;ve also noticed a couple of what appear to be reputable SR vendors selling as well. Which I see no problem with and actually gives me a little more faith in the stated intention of the admin and staff.<br />That&#039;s why I think if Atlantis proves to be on the up and up more people should support the site and welcome having a couple of &#039;safe sites&#039; to utilize.<br />&nbsp;<br />That said, I actually found BMR before SR and picked SR (hands down) to make my first purchases, and I&#039;ll probably be looking to a trusted vendor here before I start venturing out from the warm fuzziness of SR.

				I&#039;m glad that SR vendors are open to spreading out their business.&nbsp; 99% of the people on here are legit and just want to be a part of what has been built here.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many registering there are going with the same goals.&nbsp; I am more skeptical of the leaders at Atlantis.&nbsp; Until they have the presence and track record that DPR does I might be more comfortable.&nbsp; They&#039;re the ones who ultimately control the escrow system and relay your address to the vendors (use PGP!).&nbsp; A competing site to the road would be a great ploy for scammers or LE&nbsp; :o

				I made a purchase over there, $1000 worth of MDMA powder from JOR, actually.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why everyone keeps on telling me that I am going to get ripped off. I paid, and JOR tells me the product is in transit. That seems to be exactly the same process as on SR (I am over 30K on SR, btw). This was when SR was down.<br /><br />The only difference was that it was a little bit cheaper on Atlantis for the same product from the same SR vendor.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that JOR is a scammer now just because he has vendor&#039;s accounts at Atlantis and BMR.

What do you think?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hope not too. I don&#039;t trust it. It seems like a plain and simple, slightly shit copy of SR. The main difference being the SR team have had a lot more experience in terms of the ups and downs of a marketplace like this, security, keeping vendors and buyers happy.. etc. <br /><br />Its likely that we&#039;d all be making a major compromise regarding all of those things, if we migrated there.<br /><br />I mean you only have to think about the lack of originality in their name, to realise its all a farce. Atlantis?? Wonder how they thought of that.

I know BMR is full of scammers but this is one of the few vendors who has near perfect rep/feedback and works in escrow so I&#039;m not too worried.

				I thought I would give Atlantis a lookie loo as it was so challenging to go onto SR the past week. Their buyer and seller guides are pretty much copy pasted from the SR respective guides.<br /><br />I recently just paid $650 USD as my seller&#039;s bond on SR so a $25 bond on Atlantis looks pretty attractive to me right now (and clearly that was probably their intention...)<br /><br />It concerns me that SR loyalists are accusing vendors of being disloyal by selling on both sites. I mean, politics aside, we are drug dealers and the point is to make money, right??? <br /><br />I haven&#039;t decided whether I will have a vendor account on Atlantis as well.

				Atlantis has a very &quot;startup&quot; feel -- almost a little trying *too* hard to look legit. I checked it out briefly when SR was down and it has promise. Competition is a great thing.
