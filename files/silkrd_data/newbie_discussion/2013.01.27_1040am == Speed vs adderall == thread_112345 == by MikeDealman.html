				This is probably a pretty noobish question, but i&#039;m not that experienced.&nbsp; Are they essentially the same thing?&nbsp; What&#039;s the difference?

				Depends on your speed it varies from euro paste to NA Ice Shard.<br />What most ppl refer t as speed is d-amphetamine which is close to adderall but crystal meth is d-methamphetamine and alot more fun and clean.

				I have only tried pharmaceutical d-amphetamine, and only extended-release versions. There are instant-release versions available in prescription form, and from what I&#039;ve heard IR versions are better for recreational use (more euphoria, maybe some empathy, etc.) compared to XR versions, although I have not had the chance to test this out myself.<br /><br />Street speed (refers more to d-amphetamine than d-methamphetamine from what I understand) obviously doesn&#039;t come in XR preparations, but probably there&#039;s a higher chance of impure product. However, no intentional binders and fillers (unless purposefully cut) will be found in something bought on the street, so it is more readily useable for different routes of administration (IV, insufflated).<br /><br />I guess what type of speed you use is up to you, and might vary depending on what you want to use it for/how you want to use it.

				I am also curious as to the pros and cons of these different drugs!<br /><br />The above posters are correct concerning the nomenclature of the compounds. My question is: speed vs adderall for study purposes? I have never had to drug myself to study but I am curious as to how effective you can become if you can even become &quot;better&quot; at it by using a drug. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Entity

				I would think that adderall is better to study, I have not tested it, but I try a lot of speed and it has not helped me much to study. goes further to do anything but studying when I&#039;m on the<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Works great for me.<br />But adderall might be better, since it has 75% dextro-amphetamine and 25% levo-amphetamine, while usual speed has 50/50 ratios. The levo is supposed to cause more bodyload. But the difference shouldn&#039;t be big. However, if the speed is cut with coffeine it will be much worse.

It is nice to know that you can find pure and clean stuff from trusted vendors in SR regardless of what it is.
