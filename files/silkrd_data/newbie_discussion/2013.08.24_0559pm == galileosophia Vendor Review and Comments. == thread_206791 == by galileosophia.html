				I took advantage of this vendor&#039;s sample offering of Sour Diesel and it is some really nice smoke! First off let me say thanks for the sample and I apologize for ordering more than one b/c I wasn&#039;t trying to be greedy. I wanted to be able try your herb but I also needed more than a sample size so you being helpful in that aspect made it easier on me plus I got a great deal. <br /><br />I placed the order at 3am on Tuesday and it arrived by 9:30am on Thursday. That&#039;s pretty amazing speed if. I didn&#039;t smell anything until the final layer of packaging you ask me.&nbsp; Clever packaging that was more than adequate and pretty clever too. . mbb and vacuum sealed good. You&#039;ll know what I mean when you order. The buds are very nice and arrived perfectly intact! They measured at 1.5&quot; long and 1&quot; wide of tightly packed buds with orange hairs throughout and no shake. Weighed in at 3 grams between 2 buds which is exactly what I ordered. Maybe a little more but I didn&#039;t bother busting out the old digital since its sometimes not always accurate and it looked great to me. <br /><br />This herb is energetic and is my favorite type of high for daily activities. I also felt pretty creative so I started back on old project I had lost interest in and now I have a clear plan and path to get this project going right. It&#039;s a pretty clear headed, &quot;let&#039;s get some shit done&quot; type of high. I had been originally thinking of getting a strain that would be much more detached and immobile but I&#039;m certainly glad I got this.<br /><br />I really can&#039;t wait to try their Afghan Gooey OG Kush, Bubba Kush, and the Snow Cap one day. Thanks for the opportunity and I give you 5/5 all the way around. You should try this vendor out even if you hadn&#039;t even been looking to make an herb purchase of herb.
