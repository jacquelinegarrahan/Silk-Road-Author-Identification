				This is the only official review thread for all our products.<br />Feel free to leave feedback here about your experience doing business with us and what you think of our products.<br />-D.T.-<br />!!!UPDATE!!!<br />We received many messages today for free samples and we are happy of everyones eagerness but us choosing who gets the freebies based on how quick you message us or how good your stats are is unfair and as we said it will also take us around a week to stock up on each product and have them tested before anything goes out so we instead decided to make a lotto and 5 winners will get a free sample of any product they wish (we will try and have every product tested so if not everyone is requested then we pick more winners or offer other product to other winners).<br />Tickets are 0.01 and only because we cant make them free so pick them up here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5974e65ed6<br />Winners will be chosen at random and we ask in return that you leave us a review here to help us establish trust and to verify you have received your prize and are a genuine winner.<br /><br />Good luck to all and hopefully by next week when stock is good we will have samples out so we can really get things moving!!!

				Cool man- welcome to the Road!<br />I have been looking for a reliable supplier of high quality Ketamine who can regularly ship bulk (1oz per week roughly to start).<br />How strong is your Ketamine? Are you offering any samples; I am obviously willing to pay and if the quality is as good as most dutch wares then you will have a loyal buyer for weekly long term business.<br />Best of luck and I look forward to buying your listings!<br />-Life

The K we get is always excellent, the best K you will ever try and completely uncut but we have a few different options such as our usual homegrown dutch crystal K-isomer or some indian stuff but either way we will have the batch tested before any listings go live so you will know exactly what you buy before ordering.<br />Since posting earlier we have had many many messages for free samples and instead of randomly choosing users we have instead decided to make Lottery with 5 prizes, the 5 winners may have a free sample of any of our products they wish and shipments will go out once we reach 30 tickets sold and we price only 0.01 as we cant make listing completely free.<br />This helps us get our score up faster too and is fairer than just giving first come first serve or only to high rank members as anyone from anywhere can win. We dont care if you are new or have been here since the start.
