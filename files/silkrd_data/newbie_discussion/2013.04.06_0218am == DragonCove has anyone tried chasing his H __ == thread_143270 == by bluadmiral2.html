				I&#039;ve chased SuperSun&#039;s which I thought was great and Purest which was good also. I want to get some #4 from DragonCove, has anyone tried chasing this?? I know&nbsp; #4 isn&#039;t the greatest for smoking but he claims it can be chased. Anybody try it? He gets an A+ for communication, I asked him and he got right back to me and suggested I put out here. ( I don&#039;t get much exposure being a newbie so anyone seeing this that knows whats up with Cove&#039;s H lemme know )

				So I went ahead and got DragonCove&#039;s H, it chases quite well doesn&#039;t leave much residue on the foil and runs around easily. For the price I think it may be my new favorite, I was really into Supersun&#039;s &#039;SuperTar&#039; but he discontinued it and the final batch I just got tasted a little funny. He&#039;s out with this West Coast China White Im dying to try but for 350$ a G Im a little reluctant, hopefully he&#039;ll offer 1/4 Gs. Does the price of H on SR going up? Iv&#039;e only been here two weeks but the prices seem sky high, I guess its convenient not having to go into shitty neighborhoods on your lunch break but still there was that excitement factor.

				Hey guys, the CW price is much less than that now. You must have looked at that listing while I was adjusting it. That price was somewhat of a fluke based on the btc price peak which occurred right at the time I started listing the CW. Remember that peri0od that btc was around $240 and 10 hours later it was around $100.<br />So I believe the West Coast China White is around or just under $200 a G, at least that is what it should be. You know I always like to fatten the bags too, so you get a good deal.<br /><br />Try it, you will like it.<br />SS

				200$ a G sounds much more reasonable, I was gettin&#039; worried prices were about to go sky high. I loved the SuperTar and as far as service&nbsp; SuperSun is top notch. I just got done smoking a G of DragonCoves #4 and it just seemed to last forever, although the taste while chasing left a little to be desired (not like that chocolate tasting SuperTar.) I&#039;ve been dying to try that West Coast CW and now I think I will.
