				First, I’m using the name Skribble here on the Newbie forum because I can’t remember the forum-password for my real username, which is ShroudWriter. I have a ghostwriting listing on the Writing page ( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/298 ), and have been on Silk Road for 6 months. <br /><br />My problem is a competitor named APlusPapers. He is using deceptive pricing, listing his services at $.01, which is presumably the per-word rate although he doesn’t say so. What he does say is to “Ignore the price on this listing; everyone gets a customized order based on how much time this will take.”&nbsp; I’ve sent him a message warning him about this, but got no response. I’ve been in contact with DPR as well, who has threatened APlusPapers with suspension. But DPR is swamped with problems a lot bigger than this one and it will be awhile before he can follow up. <br /><br />APlusPapers does quite a lot of business, possibly fed in via a website at http://www.aplus-papers.com/.&nbsp; He states on his profile page that he is “open to alternative payments” and one feedback comment wrote that “vendor was very accommodating with payment methods”, which sounds to me like the payment was made outside SR, and this was one of the things DPR warned him about. He also has 11 more fans than number of transactions, which strikes me as very suspicious. I’ve got half as many fans as transactions because half my business was repeat business. <br /><br />I have no problem with APlusPapers bottom-feeding as long as he does it honestly, and he does get a lot of real-sounding feedback, both positive and so-so. (There are also comments like this one: “If you are in a bind or the grind. Call apluspapers and save some time!”) <br /><br />I would appreciate any feedback.<br />

				This is all you need.<br />DPR made a thread 3 months ago in the vendor section aka vendor roundtable say if rules aren&#039;t followed then ban.<br /><br /><br />Find this thread and recommit your complaint with it&#039;s link and quote to the guidelines.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll guess admin hasn&#039;t even given you access to the roundtable yet,right?<br />If not&nbsp; let me know.
