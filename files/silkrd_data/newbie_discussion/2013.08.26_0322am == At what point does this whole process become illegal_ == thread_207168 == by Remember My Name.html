				Just out of curiosity, as the title states, I was wondering when the whole SR process becomes illegal?<br /><br />I&#039;ve downloaded, installed and utilized Tor, purchased Bitcoins, transferred them through multiple digital wallets before transferring them to my SR wallet (obviously using Tor), downloaded GPGTools for Mac and I&#039;m in the process of creating a key.<br /><br />Would I be correct in saying that technically, I haven&#039;t done anything illegal yet? I would imagine that only when you transfer BTC for the purchase of drugs is when you are breaking the law. Just wondering if anybody can shed some light.<br /><br />Thanks :)

				Not a lawyer by any means, but I would think just transferring the bitcoin is not illegal. I mean, who can prove what your intent is when you transfer them? I&#039;m pretty sure completing a transaction would do it...that would be enough to signify intent...but the whole thing is pretty gray to me.

				I am not 100% on this, but I am thinking it only becomes illegal if you are caught with drugs in your mail.

				Not a pro either myself but IIRC the action only becomes illegal if you acknowledge a package as intended to be yours and it has drugs inside them as well. The only other possibility I guess would be if LE somehow got access to your account, and while monitoring it, could somehow prove that you placed an order. (Even this last one seems super farfetched, don&#039;t know if they could actually tie you to the physical placement of order.)

				I believe it is illegal once you knowingly receive a package that contains something illegal. The police need to prove that you has prior knowledge of that package and they usually do so by having you sign for it. <br /><br />Some man not to far from my house was arrested after is reeking pot package was discovered at the post office. They staked out down the road, had the mail man hand deliver the package, make him sign, and he was arrested. <br /><br />I forget the charges though, I am pretty sure he just go simple possession, etc.<br /><br />Otherwise anyone can send you anything. Any lawyer can argue and win that. And all this shit is encrypted severely. I prefer to use PGP ontop of all of that.

Always wondered why you couldn&#039;t like just accept the package first and be like lemmie verify inside at home if this is legit, otherwise its not.

				when you get an illegal substance in the mail, sending drug via mail is illegal, if you get them from another state, that&#039;s illegal.<br />It&#039;s all a federal crime.<br /><br />buying btc, not illegal, trading btc, viewing site via tor, none of those are illegal.

				Never sign for an order.&nbsp; If you ever get questioned, just deny you ordered it (anyone can mail something to anyone).<br /><br />As long as you purchase from reputable vendors, you have nothing to worry about (AKA stealth).

				We all know that it is very unlikely you would ever get investigated or prosecuted over a small order. And that it is quite likely that a controlled delivery would be necessary to prove that the drugs were actually purchased by you.<br /><br />I feel the original question is the more interesting one. When do the actions actually become illegal? I&#039;m sure it depends on the country and jurisdiction.&nbsp; I have only basic law knowledge, but the first possible charge would likely be an attempt charge.&nbsp;

				I read about someone in Australia being done for attempting to make a purchase. I expect that the moment you click on buy and make the payment you have crossed the line. Whether or not something is illegal is not the same thing as whether or not it can be proven that you have commited a crime. Once you sign for a parcel, for example, there is evidence, but you have already broken the law at that point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Similar to how you can be convicted for purchasing something on the street that is not illegal, but you thought that it was (as in fake drugs in an LE setup). Guilty by intent.
