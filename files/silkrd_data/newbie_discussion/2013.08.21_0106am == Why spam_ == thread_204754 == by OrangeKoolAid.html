				Just because this is the nub section does not mean that there is no possibly in posting about some real shit? 50 posts are really not that many. That is only my opinion. As I lay back smoking another cig. just waiting for my package to arrive. Gotta love when the mail man is my drug dealer and he does not even know it.

				I agree, it&#039;s become more difficult because the majority of posts have become spams.&nbsp; But there is a lot we could teach each other and discuss before annoying others on the main forums.&nbsp; Just think about how annoyed we will all likely be a few months from now by the newbs who spammed their way through 50<br /><br />full disclosure: I started a spamming thread, but now regret it

				I wouldn&#039;t be too hard on yourself, these spam threads hopefully spell out why 50 post waiting period is not the best idea

				The only reason I can see for rushing to 50 is so you don&#039;t have to look at all this spam!<br /><br />I agree, the 50 idea seems a little lame. Don&#039;t know who came up with that or why.<br /><br />But all of us agreed that we would not spam when we signed onto the forum.<br /><br />But then again. When can you take a bunch of druggies and dealers at their word?
