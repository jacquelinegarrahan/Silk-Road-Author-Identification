				Ok so I have 12 Green Bulls and 2 Red Bulls from kwikEmart and going to EDC for all 3 days<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not suppose to mix pills for EACH night right? or is that only for like the different kinds of pills?<br /><br />Most likely just gonna do 2 Green bulls a night but would mixing in a red bull on the third day do any damage? or will it be fine since the red bulls are basically the same except added speed<br /><br /><br />Mixing mollies and the green bulls won&#039;t be such a good idea either huh? I&#039;m just in a dilemma&nbsp; :-\

				Those pills should all be pretty clean (should be unadulturated and contain just mdma) except the red bulls which have some speed in them. You can mix them with molly (also just mdma). However, I wouldnt recommend rolling three days in a row, even for EDC. I&#039;m going too and im probably only rolling two nights and im gonna chill on the third. I&#039;ve heard of people getting irreversible anxiety/mood disorders from rolling more than 2 nights in a row, but ive also seen people be completely fine.

				As long as you tested and are 100% sure they are all MDMA, you know the doses, even with the bit of amphetamine in the reds, you will be fine. You MUST know the doses of the pills and your body in regards to how much shit you can or cant handle. <br /><br />The general rule of thumb, is...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Dosages by weight, including booster. <br />Weight lb.&nbsp; Kg Body Mass&nbsp; Initial 1.5mg/Kg&nbsp; Booster .5mg/Kg&nbsp; Total Dose <br />90lb&nbsp; 40.9Kg&nbsp; 61mg&nbsp; 20mg&nbsp; 82mg <br />100lb&nbsp; 45.5Kg&nbsp; 68mg&nbsp; 23mg&nbsp; 91mg <br />110lb&nbsp; 50.0Kg&nbsp; 75mg&nbsp; 25mg&nbsp; 100mg <br />120lb&nbsp; 54.5Kg&nbsp; 82mg&nbsp; 27mg&nbsp; 109mg <br />130lb&nbsp; 59.1Kg&nbsp; 89mg&nbsp; 30mg&nbsp; 119mg <br />140lb&nbsp; 63.6Kg&nbsp; 95mg&nbsp; 32mg&nbsp; 127mg <br />150lb&nbsp; 68.2Kg&nbsp; 102mg&nbsp; 34mg&nbsp; 136mg <br />160lb&nbsp; 72.7Kg&nbsp; 109mg&nbsp; 36mg&nbsp; 145mg <br />170lb&nbsp; 77.3Kg&nbsp; 116mg&nbsp; 39mg&nbsp; 155mg <br />180lb&nbsp; 81.8Kg&nbsp; 123mg&nbsp; 41mg&nbsp; 164mg <br />190lb&nbsp; 86.4Kg&nbsp; 130mg&nbsp; 43mg&nbsp; 173mg <br />200lb&nbsp; 90.9Kg&nbsp; 136mg&nbsp; 45mg&nbsp; 181mg <br />210lb&nbsp; 95.5Kg&nbsp; 143mg&nbsp; 48mg&nbsp; 191mg <br />220lb&nbsp; 100.0Kg&nbsp; 150mg&nbsp; 50mg&nbsp; 200mg <br />230lb&nbsp; 104.5Kg&nbsp; 157mg&nbsp; 52mg&nbsp; 209mg <br />240lb&nbsp; 109.1Kg&nbsp; 164mg&nbsp; 55mg&nbsp; 219mg <br />250lb&nbsp; 113.6Kg&nbsp; 170mg&nbsp; 57mg&nbsp; 227mg <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=55242#ixzz2SaBVzLBQ

				Also its safe to mix your pills too. If youve rolled before, you can probably easily handle 200mg of mdma (2 green bulls) also MDMA is a pretty safe drug so overdosing is very unlikely (people that overdose usually take obsurd amounts) and it should also be okay to take the red bulls too, but expect a very energetic roll.

				I&#039;m about 125lbs 5&#039;4<br /><br />so taking 3 green bulls for 2-3 nights would be alright right?<br /><br />Most likely goin for 3 for 2 nights but I&#039;m still not sure<br /><br /><br />So the only reason people say don&#039;t mix pills is because of non clean MDMA pills on the streets? I was just always careful not to mix lol I guess I was wrong

				The reason you may not want to mix pills is because of the uncertainty regarding their contents. <br />tbh though, I&#039;ve mixed pills before plenty of times and I&#039;m still alive. And yeah, taking 3 a night for 3 nights will be fine. Back in the day I would take upwards of ten a night over a long weekend. People still do this today.<br /><br />I still reckon you should source some mdma crystal and make up your own pills, but each to their own.

				I have taken red green and blue (i believe, it was quite a while ago) playboys, crushed them all and snorted them at once. Burned my entire left side of my face for like 30 min, but I was rolling balls with little to no negative side effects... Not saying it was smart or a good idea, just letting you know I was fine...

				I am indeed. I was rolling super hard for that low of an amount of mdma. I even &quot;blacked out&quot; then came back to day tripper by the Beatles playing over the radio. It was amazing. The only roll I&#039;ve had that was more clean were white aliens, or spacemen... Can&#039;t remember ATM... And of course the lovely Molly =)

				Yea for such small pills they pack quite a whollop (probs cuz they have a bit of caffeine). I wasnt rolling that long ago but i had some friend who had some of the OG pokes and playboys. The new reboots (supposedly from the same presser) are all REEEEALLY good. I took 3 of the m80&#039;s at beyond wonderland this year and i rolled absolute balls. Best night. Ever. Look out for any of the new pokes, macs, naked ladies or if you&#039;re lucky maybe m80&#039;s theyre all EXCELLENT rolls.

				You should roll only 2 days probably if you want to make it all 3 nights. <br />Mixing the red bulls with the green bulls is perfectly fine however I would space them out.<br />Start with the red bull first and early so you aren&#039;t still speeding in the morning.<br />And mixing molly with green bull is fine as well because they are both pure MDMA.<br />PLUR&nbsp; 8)

I&#039;d hop on that so fast. I&#039;m pretty sure that won&#039;t be happening though unless someone like you or me happens upon a large quantity of them. There&#039;s such a high demand for them in SoCal that no dealer would ever think of selling them on the silkroad. Why sell them on the web and be bothered with the hassle of shipping when you can get $10 a pop on the streets?
