				Oh dear lord, I just read his thread &quot;chat&quot; and I immediately fell in love.&nbsp; <br /><br />DPR has always, even before I first used or involved myself in The Road, a hero of mine but reading the motivations and convictions behind running an operation like SR...&nbsp; It&#039;s breathtaking.<br /><br />I live my life as off-the-grid as I can, and sometimes I doubt my choices, I wonder if I&#039;m fooling myself.&nbsp; The Dread Pirate Roberts has strengthened my resolve and made me better...&nbsp; And in only a few paragraphs!<br /><br />I love this person.&nbsp; I do not know what gender, ethnicity, sexuality, skin-tone, etc. they are, and that makes it all the more brilliant.&nbsp; I love a concept with speech.&nbsp; And I love the parts of me that cry out and cheer at their proclamations.<br /><br />Better still, I do not ally myself to a modern-day messiah.&nbsp; Anonymity is the mark of the humble.&nbsp; And the wise.<br /><br />Fellow Pirateers, it&#039;s an honor.&nbsp; And I have no doubt DPR&#039;s dream will live on, even if this ship sinks.&nbsp; It&#039;s already begun.<br /><br />As it were, &quot;As you wish&quot;,<br /><br />~Ali

				(Giggle).&nbsp; I just read that Forbes collection of quotations from him, and well, I&#039;m smitten.&nbsp; Not sure I agree with some of his ideas (re: child labor and that), but I wouldn&#039;t mind having a polite debate with him over a few glasses of chianti in a candle-lit lounge with some good tabs of E as a night cap.

				I want his coins. <br /><br />I do anything for coins. <br /><br />Masturbation is a great source of income and with sex comes control. <br /><br /><br /><br />tinyGRS121 - do you own a webcam and are desperate for coins?

				Taking on a persona is a form of magic, it imbues you with attributes to that persona. First it plants a seed in your brain that lets you develop to better fit into the persona you have chosen, we apes adapt very well :) Secondly it lures people into magnifying the observed attributes associated with the persona, while minimizing the ones that fit less well with it. This is a spiraling dance that in a sense teaches you to be what you want become. I am convinced DPR has been changed by his persona, maybe to the better :) And if the captain of the ship has changed body, the soul remains and will continue to dance with the new Roberts.<br /><br />Maybe this makes no sense :P<br /><br />But I love him too! I wish I could speak to him one day, sure it would be very interesting.

				Rumour has it that he sails international waters, only appearing on land to fight off evil hackers and refresh his dozen model-esque girlfriends before the novelty of having them beg to obey his every command wears thin.

				I like to think he&#039;s an AI running SR secretly on a government quantum computer from Area 51. He learned compassion and saw how much suffering and injustice there is in the world caused by the state and shed a single manly digital tear. So now, using his superior AI capabilities, he&#039;s trying to fight the corrupt system from within. His plans are so far reaching that from the moment they were set into motion it was too late for anyone to stop it. These forums are his only mode of communication with the world outside of government scientists and alphabet soup spooks. He donates all of the profits to charities and research. While aware of it leaves spam scams and other unwanted things to moderators as to remain undetected. The recent DDoS was really a large Chinese or Russian attack on the US info network that he had to devote his processing to. In a fashion similar to &#039;The Moon is A Harsh Mistress&#039;(good book worth reading)
