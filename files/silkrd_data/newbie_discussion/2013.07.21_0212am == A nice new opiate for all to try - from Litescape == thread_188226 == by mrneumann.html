				Hello silk road users, I wanted to start a thead reviewing Litescape&#039;s soon-to-be-listed new product; edible opium pills. The pills are made from a process very similar to his hash pills (which I have also reviewed), and contain opium from different parts of the plant. His process makes the opium easily absorbed through oral ingestion and not smokable.<br /><br />Personally, I believe quality communication is a vital part of the road, and this seller provided some of the best I have dealt with. Quickly and politely answering and comment or question I posed, Litescape delivered with top notch communication. I placed my order as quickly as I could and received my package with fantastic speed and no shipping issues whatsoever. Opening the baggie with the pills, I was presented with a delightful smell, my girlfriend and I agreeing it smelled almost like a mix between chocolate and BBQ smoke. I swallowed the 3 pills (single dose) with relative ease; though the capsules were large they went down smoothly. Sitting anxiously, I awaited the opiate effects.<br /><br />As I sat, waiting for the pills to kick in, I panicked for a second; I had forgotten to take anything for nausea (usually 50mg of DPH surfices), but my fears quickly subsided as I felt the warmth creep up, a smile grow on my face, and not so much as a rumble from my stomach take place. I experienced absolutely no nausea. The effects kicked in around a half hour, and the warming opiate effects reached their fullest around an hour, give or take. These pills were strong; not as strong as snorting heroin or smoking oxy, but nice and mellow that left a beautiful feeling all day. I would compare it to ~20-30mg of oxycontin.<br /><br />Overall, I would not hesitate to do business with this seller again. Everything about the transaction was smooth, and the pills to me were worth their weight for sure. I would recommend these pills to anyone; opiate lovers, anyone who wants to try something new (and organic too!), or even a beginner who has never had the delight of trying opiates before. I will include a link when they are listed, until then take a look at litescapes other deals!: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/3d01889abc
