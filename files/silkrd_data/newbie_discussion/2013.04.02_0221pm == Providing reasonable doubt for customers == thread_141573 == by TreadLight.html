				When I start selling my shrooms I want my prospective customers to be as safe as possible. I know the rule of thumb is a buyer should simply act as he didn&#039;t order the package if he gets pinched. Perhaps set it aside for a couple days before opening it. I have a couple ideas for some extra insurance.<br /><br />Idea#1: Say I ship powdered shrooms to look like herbal supplements or any other number of things. What if I include a fake invoice inside, for the said supplements. And what if the TO address on the invoice was a completely different name and address than the one the package was shipped to? Would that be an extra weapon in the defense attorney&#039;s arsenal?<br /><br />Idea#2: What if I also include in bold letters a statement at the top of the invoice that says something like “In the event you received this package in error please contact the following email address for dispensation instructions”. And if someone emails that address they will receive an automatic reply stating something like “This is an automatic response. The package you inadvertently received contains a controlled substance. For your own safety do not consume it. I periodically ship such packages to random addresses to throw off law enforcement from my illicit activities. Feel free to dispose of the package in any way you see fit or to turn it in to law enforcement. Sorry for the inconvenience.”<br /><br />Alright, I admit that might be overkill but imagine LE does catch your customer receiving the package. Wouldn&#039;t that be more than enough reasonable doubt to get anyone off? Is there a downside to either idea?

				+1 for the good ideas man<br />Not sure about #1 but #2 sounds like an amazing idea, I look forward to other responses to this.

				Great ideas! Although I will never sell on the Road I have often thought of packaging different power like substances as some kind of powdered herb or something of that nature. The second idea is great too. It provides more power to your customers and attorneys in case a shipment ends up in the wrong hands.&nbsp; :D

				Both ideas are pretty decent.&nbsp; &nbsp;My 2 cents- I would definitely prefer to buy from someone that could offer that little bit extra- just in case :) <br />

				good ideas... but they will only work depending on the person who is receiving the package, i don&#039;t think enough of the buyers on here are aware of the protections they need to take as well to make sure this whole process is as safe as possible.
