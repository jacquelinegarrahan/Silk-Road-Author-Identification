				I often wander how many eyes are moving over this forum, who don&#039;t participate in the activities of most. I think we all owe it to each other to be responsible ,and to offer advice and look out for each other. L/E&nbsp; &amp; Journo&#039;s and other people watching, should always be aware how many educated and civilized people are here. We can show them that we are responsible and every precaution is taken to ensure others are also.And by looking out for new users/buyers and advising the best course of action ( rather than street dealers who s only motivation is greed,) available to them.<br /><br />People are watching, lets show them how responsible we are and how we utilize the freedom we are given in an selfless&nbsp; and altruistic manner. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure people have pointed this out before this is aimed at the newbs really me included, and I&#039;m sorry for going over old ground. Also I&#039;m aware of the likes of Scout, and other mods, members&nbsp; who are very approachable for any sensible questions/worries. Please think about who is reading and watching, and we can set a precedent for the new generations to come.<br /><br />
