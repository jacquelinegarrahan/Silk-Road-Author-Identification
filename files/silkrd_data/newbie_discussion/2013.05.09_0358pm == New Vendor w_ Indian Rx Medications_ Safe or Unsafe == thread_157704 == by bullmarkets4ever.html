				JackofSpades started a thread about this vendor with the indian made meds on the rumormill board.. but since can&#039;t fucking post there wanted to see if any tribal-knowledge about these things amongst this group.<br /><br />from a new guy around here, at least new profile / username: greendaddy888<br />has all kinds of Rx and clearly states &quot;these are from India.. not as strong... not dangerous.. good quality and good buzz, etc.. &quot;<br /><br />Any experience/s with Indian meds?<br />Concerns?<br />Clearly definable and noticeable differences in these counterfeit/bootlegged versions vs the genuine, real US made versions?&nbsp; There must be a way to distinguish between the real and the &quot;indian versions&quot;.. right?<br /><br />I personally am EXTREMELY LEERY about putting counterfeit (read: faked) rx meds into my body.<br /><br /><br />All info welcome!<br />Please let us all know.<br /><br />

				India has a law that allows pharmaceutical companies there to ignore patents filed before 1995, so a number of drugs that are still under patent in the US are already generic there. But generic doesn&#039;t mean fake — it&#039;s usually the exact same chemical formula, or perhaps an enantiomer (a mirror-image configuration) with the same bioactivity.<br /><br />It&#039;s plausible that someone in India could obtain a number of these genuine generics without going to too much trouble. Many generics that are controlled substances in the US are available over the counter in India. Modafinil (Provigil) is a good example.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the rate of counterfeiting medication in India, though. I&#039;ve never heard of it, but absence of evidence is not evidence of absence and your n is 1 here, so.<br /><br />I would request that he post a picture of the packaging and I&#039;d confirm that India does indeed have a generic version of whatever drug you&#039;re interested in for sale in pharmacies. Wikipedia&#039;s pretty good on that front for most of the fun Rx drugs.

				i&#039;ve ordered prescriptions from indian pharmacies, and had both good and bad experiences. make sure your pills are in a blister package or have some kind of evidence of being genuine - at least do a search on the color, shape, and imprints on the pills, make sure theyre not sugarpills or anything. don&#039;t go for meds that dont seem right -- something that should be a tablet, for instance, being sold in a generic capsule. <br /><br />keep in mind the standards for factory hygiene, product purity, exact mg doseage, etc are nowhere near as stringent in india as they might be in, say, the US.

				i just placed a sample order with him so I&#039;ll update on any info once I receive them if anyone wants...<br /><br />i really appreciated his honesty in stating that his pills are from india.&nbsp; I feel stupid to admit this but I hadn&#039;t realized there were indian pills that would look the same (i.e. a215s) <br />however, in the past I have gotten some pills from other vendors that I suspected something was a little bit off about them...slightly different markings/color/texture and did not feel as strong to me.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying out his sample so that I can have something to compare future orders to so I can see if other sellers are selling knock offs at ridiculous prices, and then I can avoid those sellers. If his product is good enough, at the current prices he has listed it may be worth it to buy from him again. <br /><br />If anyone has any information on fillers that may be used in these products or anything else that could be dangerous I would love to hear it though.

				I posted the following in the other thread about this in the Rumor Mill.<br />We need to keep our eye out for the broader effects of these tainting other, previously trusted, sources.<br /><br />Please continue to post your experiences / suspicions of these meds from any vendor who may now be trying to move them, either mixed in with legit product, or reselling them:<br /><br />Yeah, I hope this thread gets more readers.<br /><br />This is a problem -- on many levels.&nbsp; This will likely produce and spread other problems for the Regular Oxy Buyers on SR.<br />His reviews are not great.&nbsp; The problem with him/his product specifically is there is uncertainty about what you will get as a buyer: oxy in 27.5mg, 18mg, 7mg, 1.5mg...&nbsp; or something like alprozolam at 3mg or what the fuck ever else is in those pills that are pseudo oxy 30&#039;s.<br /><br />The broader, and in my view, much bigger problem is that this will undoubtedly tempt a few regular vendors of Oxy to buy at the ridiculous low price and fucking co-mingle this bullshit with their regular offerings, e.g. cut their orders with some number of fakes to increase their inventory and profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />As regular oxy buyers we need to be vigilant to confront and post about every detial when we run across these fake pills, especially as they are found amongst our usual vendors, as I fear this will go far beyond greendaddy very quickly and dilute the quality, and perhaps the safety of product we are accustomed to.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll start a new thread for Purchased Oxy Counterfeits, whether on purpose or inadvertently so we can stay on top of the issue and hopefully nip the problems in the bud as they arise.&nbsp; I know my usual vendors enjoy mine, and many other experienced users of Oxy&#039;s business... If they make the Huge mistake of trying to pass these on as US/regular product we need to fucking blast that info on the forums and in the Finalizing reviews without hesitation!<br /><br />If non-expert/non-experienced Oxy users.. or gamblers ... wish to buy from greendaddy, so be it.&nbsp; That portion will stay isolated there.<br />Its the proliferation of bogus knock offs that has my attention.

				I ordered 100 suboxone off him sunday night, awaiting their arrival. Prices were looking like I was going to be paying around $24 a strip until I saw greendaddys listing for slightly over $3 a strip. I messaged him and he said they are made with the &quot;good ingredients&quot;. Really hope they are legit as they are needed to quit opiates so if they are anything other then suboxone they will be completely useless.

				@dissolvedgirl<br /><br />Yeah I&#039;ll definitely post feedback, no good in sticking more then one of us with bunk subs. Someone in the other thread posted that he got a couple subs thrown in as a sample and he said they seemed bootleg, however he wrote that he did a bunch of those oxys that day and due to that i doubt he tried the subs himself so I still have some hope. I&#039;m hoping if they are bunk I can get a refund or at least an exchange of some kind. He claims he sells them to people in his local area without issue so we will see. It&#039;s a shame there isnt an easy way of testing pills to see exactly what is in them.

				@dissolvedgirl<br /><br />Sounds good, I&#039;d be interested to know as everything is a very good price. The unfortunate thing about the subz is that if they are anything other then suboxone they wont have any use for my purposes regardless of whether or not they give a buzz. If they are real suboxone however then it&#039;s definitely a great deal. He says they are sourced from the UK which is more encouraging then them being from India or something.

				i got my order today:<br /><br />9 of the k/9 pills<br />1 of the a215<br /><br />and as a bonus:<br />2 suboxone <br />2 endocet (5mg percocets)<br /><br />packaging was decent, obviously from a smokers home though.

				there is no way i would have ever fallen asleep like i did on 30mg of adderall. i don&#039;t take it often. i haven&#039;t really seen many reviews of his adderall though and any that i have seen say they are good.&nbsp; i will try again tomorrow morning &amp; not take anything else at the time to see if that changes anything. i&#039;ve never seen that brand/style of adderall before either.&nbsp; if not i will be really disappointed because i was counting on those to be legit...whereas these roxies were a gamble since he clearly said what they are.&nbsp; the fact that there is a burn when snorted combined with the fact that i fell asleep makes me think maybe there is some kind of benzo in these? any other ideas?

				It sounds like everything of his has been fake so far so its starting to seem unlikely that the suboxone would be sourced from a legit source, especially considering the price. It&#039;s a shame because at least if i was ordering pain pills to get high off of and they werent as advertised but still got me high I would at least be getting what I wanted but if the suboxone isnt suboxone it is essentially useless. Has anyone complained to him after recieving the order? I ordered sunday night and havent recieved mine yet. The suboxone was not listed as replicas or fakes however and he assured me they were good over PM, maybe they will be good fingers crossed but if they arent I hope he will either refund or at least exchange it with something else. Has anyone hear complained to him, did he offer a solution if yes?

				He clearly says the quality is good and they&#039;re just not as strong as the originals.&nbsp; Listing something as oxy (or any other drug) and sending out completely bunk pills is not being honest; it&#039;s a scam. (And his original listings didn&#039;t even have that disclaimer; they simply said made in India.)<br /><br />I have sent him two PMs requesting cancellation on his end, and both replies from him have been the same paragraph copied and pasted about how people can&#039;t expect full strength product at those prices and he doesn&#039;t offer refunds.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think he even read my messages.
