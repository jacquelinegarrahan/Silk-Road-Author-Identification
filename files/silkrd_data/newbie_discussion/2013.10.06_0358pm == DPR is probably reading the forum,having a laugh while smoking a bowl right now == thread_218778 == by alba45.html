Do you just take everything written in the warrant as fact? Cops would never bullshit right? They certainly wouldn&#039;t trump up evidence on bullshit charges for which they appear to have nothing more than whatever was unencrypted communication: which equals nothing unless the mastermind was actually a moron, in which case good luck convincing a jury he&#039;s a mastermind.<br /><br />Cops do shit like this all the time, trump shit up to get a warrant and hope they hit paydirt when they strike.<br /><br />They have to convince a jury, presumably without the cooperation of DPR giving them passwords and such, that he is THE one and only DPR (that there even IS one DPR is a fact that&#039;s been hotly debated, as is the question of whether one person who (if you believe the warrant) is incompetent enough to make all these idiotic mistakes while remaining one step ahead of every police force in the world for more than two years - yet another thing they have to convince the jury.<br /><br />Would the &#039;real&#039; DPR have been living in a share house even? Hell, maybe, but it&#039;s again not the picture the warrant paints - that of a book-smart criminal racking up huge illicit profits but apparently unable to engage others to hire servers on his behalf, not have stuff specifically shipped to his street address - much less things with his photo inside (apparently).<br /><br />Would DPR ever give out his photograph to a member on here?? Apparently his real date of birth? No fucking way...<br /><br />Feds sent those, probably unasked, as a mechanism to a) make it international since the documents passed over the Canadian border b) make it controllable - since they made and sent the IDs (if they ever even existed) it&#039;s easy for them to do a &#039;routine&#039; border mail check (yah right), and then show up, incriminating evidence in hand, to an address they probably pulled using PRISM.<br /><br />Ulbricht knew at the time, imo, that he never ordered those (probably never got his photo from him either but used one they got from somewhere) and said flat out: &quot;Hypothetically, anyone could order something on a web site named silk road and have it sent to them&quot;. Anyone - as in, it&#039;s not illegal to receive something in the mail, unless they can prove &#039;he&#039; (ie the man standing in front of them) ordered it.<br /><br />The ID, and probably the whole murder for hire bullshit (none of which is admissible in court anyway if the communication was encrypted I believe, assuming he encrypted it to an undercover cop) was just in the first instance to manufacture a legitimate way of gaining on public record of the investigation a suspect&#039;s name, dob, residence, photograph and whatever interview they could coax out of him. The warrant and a bunch of really flimsy unprovable bullshit, rests on whatever they find on his computers, if anything.<br /><br />Remember - the warrant sounds damning because it&#039;s SUPPOSED TO. The events in it are not debated, nor proven. Its sole purpose, from the police point of view, is to convince the judge by any means necessary that this citizen IS a criminal, even if it appears otherwise. They did that, now they get to try to prove it all.<br /><br />Considering all that, and the fact that the online drug trade has barely skipped a beat, it makes it even more confusing why they would make THIS move now.

				Conspiracy theorist nonsense. If they can get a guy in pakistan whom has no contact with almost anyone and the complete faith and admiration of his comrades, then they can get a teenage pothead controlling a drug site. Hey people mess up man. The idiot like to brag to Forbes and probably all his buddies. Thought he was in complete control as it turns out he wasn&#039;t. It was only matter of time before they found him. People mess up. I&#039;ve seen better drug operations than this fall.

				Well bad news for most of you Ross was DPR as you and most the other people on silkroad know. He was the primary administering force behind silkroad, he was here since the very beginning, and helped with the creation. But here&#039;s the kicker if you mean the founder and creator of Silkroad, he has never gone by the name DPR other then he has used and spoken from the account on occasion. But if you ever noticed DPR&#039;s account was not even the oldest administers account. Any who he is definitely sitting back watching this laughing. Not only is he reading but vending, many of you order from him and would never know and most certainly he is probably smoking a bowl, as many of you are smoking his bowls too. =P<br /><br />Hint hint, I know im going to get some angry messages when he/they reads this, but you guys have to think with your head, why else would he create the silkroad, not just for other people to vend, but for himself to move product.

				Well if they lay low their market share will be gone if they ever come back&nbsp; - silk road may have been the longest lasting so far, but the only reason it didn&#039;t have tougher competition before is because it was established and trusted.<br /><br />Now that trust and establishment are back at ground zero, anyone and everyone from organised crime to ambitious geeks are going to try and get in first to establish whatever the standard platform is next.<br /><br />With complaints about BMR&#039;s interface, Sheep&#039;s customer support, how many websites do you think are being made right now? :D<br /><br />If online black markets were a genie, silk road was the cork in the bottle...FBI just removed that cork.

				Everybody knows that the Winklevoss Twins are the true founders of the road, and I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll find another patsy to create their idea.<br />&nbsp;Though, I think anybody new will have to woo the vendors to their site. Hopefully, with all the publicity, the next main site registers some new and decent vendors. I mean several major dealers were caught, and it&#039;s obvious that they were pitiful drug dealers. I was wondering while all the drugs on the road seem to be inferior and exorbitantly priced. Now, I understand why...

He took me to his cabin and he told me his secret. ‘I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts’ he said. ‘My name is Ryan; I inherited the ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from is not the real Dread Pirate Roberts either. His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like a king in Patagonia. Then he explained the name was the important thing, for inspiring the necessary fear.
