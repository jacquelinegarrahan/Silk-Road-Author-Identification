				If customs seized your package deny that it&#039;s yours. You have no control over what gets shipped to your address.

				Did you use paypal to pay for your package? Not a good idea. Pay pal is NOT annon. for a reason. SR uses btc for a reason. When you deal with a government controlled currency you have way more restrictions etc. <br />If you are just wanting to use pay pal to generate a fake receipt I dont think that will work either. Each transaction will have a confirmation #. It would take all of two min. to realize the transaction records are fake.<br /><br />Like it was said before I would just call them back and tell them politely that you dont know where or who it came from. Also I dont know what polish customs is like but I assume they have no grounds to push it any further than that. <br /><br />It sucks to hear that you lost your package. In the world of SR that is juat the reality sometimes. No matter what deny, deny, deny!<br /><br />Cheers

				As stated above, There is no need to ever contact them about it, They are fishing for information, You cant control what people send you even if it does look suspicious. The most they could do would be to send the police to knock on your door and ask questions. Dont even answer it. They can just say they smell weed and search your full house if they feel like it. If they had evidence they would not be knocking. <br />Consider the adress burned and chill.
