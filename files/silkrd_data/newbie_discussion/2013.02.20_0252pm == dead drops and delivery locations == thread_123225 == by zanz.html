				the best way is to get them delivered to a legit residential address with a real name connected. make sure the vendors packaging methods are up to scratch and avoid international until you&#039;re confident or you&#039;ll be a paranoid wreck for a week+<br />vendors often refuse to ship to PO boxes because they get seized more often and just make the whole thing look sus.

				Honestly i don&#039;t really see a problem using your real name and address, as long as you don&#039;t do something stupid like sign for the package, anyone can send anyone else anything in the mail. The important thing is to always try and maintain plausible deny-ability.

				Send to a legit residential address using the real name of whoever lives there. <br /><br />HOWEVER, if you use your own address and name it is important that you do not sign for the package and that your product does not stay in your house. <br />It&#039;s best just to move it immediately once it arrives.<br /><br />As for me, I use my friend&#039;s apartment and I pick it up as soon as he tells me it&#039;s arrived and move it to where I keep it.<br />-Mel

				PO boxes are run by the government. You also have to walk into a federal building to receive your mail.<br />If that PO box is in your name and you arrive to pick up a package that they have seized or whatnot it may not end well for you.<br /><br />While yes you are involving your friend by getting things sent to his place in his name, he then has plausible dependability if things were to go bad as long as he has nothing incriminating in his possession. The trick is to never have him be involved in holding the package, even though it would have to be in his name. Just a reminder though that nobody should ever sign for a package, ever. Let the mailman leave it on your doorstep.<br /><br />But yeah PO boxes = federal government which makes it a bad idea. The only exception which I don&#039;t know everything about would be&nbsp; if you were to have a PO box under a company name which has no direct relation to yourself.<br /><br />-Mel

				As the laws vary so greatly from state to state, country to country, you really need to check and understand the laws (and relevant past case precedents the courts will generally accept and follow) as they apply to you in your location, to work out what the best strategy is going to be for you in minimizing your legal risks, and creating your &quot;fire safety plan&quot; for when LE come knocking on/down your door.<br /><br />Using a potential possession type charge as an example, where I&#039;m from, LE have to demonstrate to the court proof beyond reasonable doubt that i am knowingly in possession of or knowingly intended to possess, the drug in question.<br /><br />They could easily prove this by <br />- having me admit to it on the spot or in an interview, <br />- observing the actual transaction take place<br />- me asking an under-cover / off-duty police officer in a nghtclub for some pills or whatever,<br />- an admission / details arranging it recorded on my computer/phone/tablet etc or by a listening device or telecommunications intercept (phone call, SMSs, e-mail, private messaging on a forum etc).<br />- finding the drugs inside my house, car, pocket, any place i have control over access to the exclusion of anyone else.<br /><br />On that last point, the law assumes i am guilty of possession/intent to possess, but shifts the burden of proof onto me to allow me the opportunity to prove i did not infact know the drug(s) were there, or even if i did know they were there that i did not intend to possess them (eg un-opened envelope&nbsp; from todays mail on the floor in my house or in my PO box, or even an opened envelope - i&#039;ve seen the drugs or baggie or whatever, but knew nothing about it, dont know who or why it was sent to me, there are no other drugs or drug paraphernalia found during a search of my house, no prior drug related legal incidents, etc that might indicate i&#039;m a drug user.<br /><br />Like i said, this just relates to my country and state - learn the laws etc as they apply to you in your location, and make your arrangements around those.&nbsp; And have a &quot;fire safety plan&quot; for when you are confronted with legal problems one day (and you have to assume you will be at some stage)....

				seems very important not to have any drugs or drug tools in the residence the package is delivered to.<br /><br />also, maybe leave the package outside for a bit and even write &quot;return to sender&quot; on it.&nbsp; regardless, when in doubt, dont touch it.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				also, packages over a certain size will not fit in a PO box, so they (!) will keep it in the back room (!!) until you come in and pick it up in person (!!!!!).&nbsp; Bad idea all around.
