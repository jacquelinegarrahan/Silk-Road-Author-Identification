				Daruthless1 got me to fe for a Q p for 600 and never wrote back or shipped my pack. Now I click on his vendor page and it takes me strait to message him. I know I shouldn&#039;t have tried to order outside of the escrow system but with over 300 transactions and his rating I assumed it was Ok. I&#039;m not rich and 600 is a huge hit for me. I will never order and fe again. I feel like such an idiot and am so pissed anyway don&#039;t fe no matter what and if everyone wouldn&#039;t no seller would ask for it!!!!

				not to bust your bubble, but if you feel like an idiot for doing it, then you have just proved yourself that you are certainly not ready for this system.&nbsp; &nbsp;SR and its system combined isnt something for everyone.&nbsp; You MUST know what you are doing and have a bit of intelligence behind you.&nbsp; I found out about it almost 2 years ago and studied the site for a good year before I made any moves.&nbsp; Now these days, I am thrilled and as happy as a baby with a lollipop

				DR1 burned a lot of people. That scumbag actually did a blot of perfect transactions with me over the last couple months, but , thats the scam, be a great , reliable vendor to gain rep and buyer trust and then fuck em all. He NEVER sold anything but single roxi 30&#039;s and 5 packs of roxi 30&#039;s and suboxone. All of a sudden.....PRESTO!!, he had coke, weed and ,,,lol,,,1000 packs of roxi IR 30&#039;s, all of a sudden all his products were FE too.&nbsp; His goofy username shoulda tipped us all off . Odds are he&#039;ll be back with a new vendor account and try it again. SR administration should just ban FE all together .

				Absolutely I agree and if no one did it what vendor would require it. I admit to a beginners mistake and believe me it won&#039;t happen again friend. It was 600 lesson and I&#039;m glad it happened now because I could very easily have lost way more. I love sr and the idea of somewhat safe anonymous market place but it&#039;s up to us to be smart and keep it safe. I fucked up and I&#039;m not asking for sympathy just letting people know what happened and hope at least one person listens and doesn&#039;t disregard the warnings like I did

				Yep he got me too bro, he was super nice to me and offered to cover my shipping costs cuz money is tight for me. After I pressed the finalize button I regretted it immediately. I searched his name on the forums and wished that I had done the search before i pressed finalize. Still I gave him the benefit of the doubt and messaged him the next day. He told me DPR went narc ratting out all the vendors...<br /><br /><br />be careful what you say cuz if you placed an order he has your address. Try not to put his name out there too much cuz if he reads and wants to be an ass he could send the cops to your door or something stupid like that.

				thanks cirrus I appreciate that. I&#039;m not going to let him detour me from the awesomeness here called sr. it was my mistake. I just have to take it slower and do my research before any transaction from now on. I&#039;m a firm believer in what goes around and I prefer to keep the circle healthy.that being said he&#039;s got some pretty bad karma now. glad it was only 600
