				Hello!<br /><br />i have a few questions i was hoping someone can help me with....<br /><br />. i placed an order a few days ago... in that time ... the value of bitcoins has risen greatly... the vender has not loged on yet and does not yet know i placed an order.<br /><br />i would like to cancel my order.... and place the same order right after... thus saving a little money.<br /><br />1. if i cancel the order.... if it was a hedge fund... will i get back the hedged dollar amount?... or will i get back all the bit coins i put up, thus bennifting from the rise in bitcoin price? <br /><br />2. will the vender know i made an order.... canceled .. and placed the order again?..... or will He/She just see 1 order and not know anything unusual happened?<br /><br />3. is this consider a black hat trick? or un-moral?&nbsp; &nbsp;.... (i just want to save a little cash... buying of this site isnt exactly cheap after fees and mark ups and such.<br /><br />4. will silk rode take a fee for a cancled order before it was marked for shiping?<br /><br />5.&nbsp; can you replace an order.. right away after a cancel?<br /><br />.........<br /><br />Please allow me to say this again... in different words.. just so i am clear.<br /><br />1. i placed an order that was hedged.... if i cancle before it is marked for shiping... will i get all the bitcoins i paid back?... or only the hedged amount?<br /><br />2. will the vender know i cancled an order... if he has not loged on yet to see the order was placed? ... will the vender know i cancled... and re-placed the order?<br /><br />&nbsp; (this vender has a habbit of black listing anyone who upsets them, from what i am told........ but He/She has what im looking for)<br /><br />3. is this considerd a dirty trick?.... (just want to save a few bucks.... the shiping cost alone makes me want to cry.. as well as the markup)<br /><br />4. will silk rode take a fee for a cancled order?... if it was canceled before being marked as shiped?<br /><br />5. can you replace an order for the same product... right away after canceling?<br /><br /><br />.....<br /><br />thank you for ur time!<br /><br /><br />
