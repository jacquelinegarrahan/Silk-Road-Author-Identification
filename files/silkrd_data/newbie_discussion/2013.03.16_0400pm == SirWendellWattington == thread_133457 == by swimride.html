				Has anyone tried this vendor yet? I just received an order from him for 4 100mg MDMA capsules. The shipping was very fast, and stealthy. It took me a little while to get to the product. Product was slightly overweight, although my scale is a little odd sometimes so that could just be me. The MDMA is an off white / yellowish powder. I have never seen MDMA look like that. Has anyone else? I have only seen brownish crystals / powder or a greyish color. Also, I have never seen MDMA as powdery as this stuff is. I tested it with Marquis, it went immediately to the dark purple / black with a few bubbles. Communication was very good from the vendor. I will update this as soon as I try it.

				I just tried the 100 MG capsules from sirwendellwattington. My GF and I each took 2, and had a great night. Very energetic, and lasted for about 4 hours. The stuff seemed pretty clean and was a great roll. It&#039;s a little pricy, but it is domestic (in the US) and it got here quickly. I would order again if I was in a hurry and couldn&#039;t order from the EU.
