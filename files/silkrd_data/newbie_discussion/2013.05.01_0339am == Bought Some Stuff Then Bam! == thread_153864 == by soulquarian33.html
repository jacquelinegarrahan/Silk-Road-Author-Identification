				Hey guys,<br /><br />New here, im guessing you have to have a certain ammount of forum posts to be able to post in the other forums, is that how it works?<br /><br />Also, I found this place 3 or 4 days ago, read up, got some bit coin, put in 2 orders from 2 different vendors and then Bam!, SR goes down =(, am looking forward to Roberts getting it up again, he said in his post that its running again, I guess there are thousands of people trying to connect, its a beautiful thing looking at whats available, as you can get some range from your local but nothing thats on here,<br /><br />Am looking forward to what the future holds, peace.

				50 posts to be able to move to other forums and post. <br />Easily achieved as you can see through all the spamming devoted threads.<br />Enjoy SR when you can gain access to it ;)

				That sucks to hear you just got your first orders in before it went down, hopefully you can get those soon. Maybe even try to get ahold of the sellers through tor email if they have one. Find them on the forums, they would appreciate that kind of contact to make sure your a legit buyer.<br />As for the 50, Im right there with you, not even half way yet but Im tryin. There are lots of spam posts and it can be easy to get to 50 that way, but I try to stick to at least legitimate topics. Although it is very interesting to find yourself in some conversations happening in here in the newbie boards. I just try to not spam and be a support of the SR community, which at times like these we do need to come together and show our support of this revolution. I love it here, ive made several purchases the past few months I could have only dreamed of a few years ago. Its brilliant! And I was lucky to have two orders I placed shipped out last saturday! already got one pak of great herbs- hoping to get acceess to finalize&nbsp;
