				I got cheap ones off ebay, they were not as good as ones that I paid about $70 from a guy from an add in a paper from.<br />One piece of advice though, check what sort of batteries they use to make sure it is a battery you can easily get especially late at night when they always run out, aaa batteries or something, trust me it sucks when batteries run out and you gotta hunt around shops for them<br />You probably only need .01scales for molly, depends on how much of a tight ass with weight you are

				If you want a .001 g scale that is really good and accurate, then you probably need to shell out 100+ bucks for it. Anything under that is probably too cheap to be reliable and truly accurate, unless you buy it from a reseller on ebay or from a local dude.

				Not sure where you are but if you&#039;re in the UK search &quot;Neewer 0.001g-20g Digital Jewelry Diamond Pocket Mini Scale&quot; on amazon.<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought loads of different kinds (all cheap) and I&#039;ve sent all of them back. The ones above are incredible. Only 15 quid! You have to use the calibration weight at least twice before every use but I&#039;ve found that they&#039;re consistently within .002g of where they should be. The best I could find for the price by miles.

				Above posts are all good.<br /><br />Online is the best option. They aren&#039;t found much in the shops because they are very sepcialised field of work that use such accurate scales e.g. herbalists, chemists, jewelers, etc.

				Like one poster said, get the gemeni 20x.001 scale off amazon for ~$20. I tested it with 3 different calibration weights (2 10 gram weights and 1 5 gram) bought from different sources (to avoid gemeni altering the results somehow - yes I&#039;m that paranoid) and it was within .002 of each calibration weight. I also tested the two 10 gram weights that were provided, and again within .002 grams. Don&#039;t spend $100 on a scale that will perform just as as well for a normal user. That .002 difference is not quite withing the .001 specs, but you also have you consider the face that there might have been a slight magnetic field effecting it, some oil from my hand got on the weight, some of the weight oxidized and changed its mass, etc. Basically, you can trust the gemeni from amazon to .002 grams (maybe even .001 grams with proper weighing techniques). When I&#039;m weighing out meth, I want 30 mg. 28mg or 32mg is okay (I usually don&#039;t even weigh out to exactly a 30mg read anyways), but the difference between 20mg vs 40mg on a .01g scale is completely unacceptable. Although I have a 20x.001g scale, a 200x.01g scale, a 5000x1g scale, and a 200,000x100g scale. If you&#039;re going to spend $200 on drugs, you might as well spend $100 on proper scales so that you don&#039;t overdose.<br /><br />It&#039;s best to be safe and get high your whole life than reckless to get high once.
