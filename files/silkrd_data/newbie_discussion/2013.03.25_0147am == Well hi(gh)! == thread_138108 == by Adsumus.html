				Uh, well, kinda sux I can&#039;t post in other sub-forums as a newbie, but why not, you gotta be careful nowadays. So, as a greenhorn in the whole TOR and SR thing I was thinking I might as well share some of my thoughts and hope for some feedback:<br />1) Do you think there&#039;s some demand for homemade organic fruit spirits (52%) and wines at the black market? I&#039;ve checked both SR and BMR and it seems BMR is a better shot considering there&#039;s currently around 55 items in the &quot;Alcohol&quot; section while there&#039;s just one at the same section on SR market. Also, you only gotta pay like 0,7BTC on BMR while you gotta pay 10x more on&nbsp; SR when you wanna become a vendor, right? What do you guys reckon?<br />2) You can check my first post ever here: http://nb5df7xeas3zl3sf.onion/umb/showthread.php?threadid=3f040ca3f5575f2306723f81b94d46dd<br />Hoping you won&#039;t fucking troll me to death over here.<br /><br />P.S.: if there&#039;s anybody out there who&#039;d be willing to trade some of my stuff (the earlier mentioned spirits or wine, but I think you&#039;d rather go for the spirits - way easier to get fucked up than from wine) for some psychadelic stuff, pm me here or you can eventually email me at adsumus@tormail.org (yeah, I&#039;ve made me some mail account too, why the hell not), I&#039;d throw some BTC in the deal too, we&#039;d figure something out. I&#039;d rly love to explore the options over here as much as I can, get to know the community and stuff. I wonder if there&#039;s any Deadhead out there for example? <br />Thanks for any response in the topic ;)<br />P.P.S.: I thought I&#039;d never get through the captcha, wtf am I retarded or what?!

				Alcohol is a bitch to ship stealthily and liquid is really heavy driving up the shipping price. I&#039;m guessing that this along with the fact that alcohol is readily available at reasonable prices almost everywhere is why no one sells it.

				Hey man, thanks for your response!<br />It&#039;s interesting I got a negative response here and a positive one at the BMR forum, but that&#039;s good, I need every info I can get.<br />As for shipping. It might be a bitch shipping to/within USA, yeah. Although, I&#039;ve made some research on it and it seems doable as long as it&#039;s not marked as an actual bottle (supposedly marking it as vase works). Sending one bottle per order seems to be ok. I&#039;m based in EU, so I was thinking I&#039;d start shippin&#039; within EU first while willing to send some testing samples overseas to some member with high reputation for feedback and possible build up of my rep.<br />I think I&#039;m rly better off starting to sell on BMR as the initial investments are much lower and the market for beverages seems to be bigger there.<br />I&#039;d still welcome more opinions, tho! :)

				I agree I think you&#039;ll have an easier time starting of on BMR than maybe work your way onto the road or just stay over on the BMR if thats working for you man. Whatever keeps your customers happy and you making money. Where I live there&#039;s a plethora of local breweries, wineries and liquor stores so purchasing homemade alcohol is a little unnecessary for me :p however I might have some left over bitcoins after my next purchase so perhaps I&#039;ll purchase a sample from you. I&#039;d be more than willing to vouch for it&#039;s quality/stealth here on the forums.

				That&#039;s cool. I&#039;m gonna go and take some pics of our stuff and cellar tonight so that I can create some decent profile and portofolio.<br />Also, yeah, I think I&#039;m gonna start selling on BMR but the stuff I&#039;m lookin&#039; for I found on SR, so my first buy will be conducted here :) <br />Just gotta pick a vendor that lets me stay in the escrow even tho I haven&#039;t made any buy yet. <br />Idk if it&#039;s allowed but if it is, I&#039;d sure advertise somewhere on this forum too once I&#039;ll have some free samples rdy to deliver.
