				I received a small order of yip today from kirbynose, and to put it succinctly, the shit is great. <br /><br />Service: 10/10 - I sent a message before my order, which kirbynose replied to right away. Once my order was made late on Monday, it was processed quickly, and shipped Tuesday morning. If you haven&#039;t looked at the main coke vendor thread in the Rumor Mill, I recommend you do it. kirbynose is new on the scene, but if you read the past 10 or 15 pages, you&#039;ll get a sense from his posts that he cares about safety, quality and service. <br /><br />Stealth: 11/10 - Perfect on a technical level, with an extra point for giving me a good laugh. I&#039;ve yet to see better.<br /><br />Product: 8.5/10 - Simply put, this is really good cocaine. The weight looked to be quite generous - I only ordered .5g and I&#039;m sure kirbynose sent a bit more. Unable to confirm, as I just learned I crushed my scale last time I moved. The smell is mild, and there wasn&#039;t even a hint of gasoline/kerosene odor. Has a nice sparkle in the light, and it chops up nicely to a very fine powder with no hard chunks flying everywhere. I rubbed a bit on my gums and a nice, subtle numbing kicked in after a minute or two, and it lasted a good 40 minutes. I did a small matchstick sized line to test, and it went up smooth with no burn. Got a surprisingly intense buzz almost right away, and felt no urge to take another rip for 45 minutes or so when the high started to tail off. The buzz is clean and euphoric with no edge to it at all. I did a couple more lines and I&#039;m feeling fantastic. kirbynose&#039;s coke checks all the boxes, and I&#039;d rate it a &#039;10&#039; if comparing only to what I&#039;ve had so far from SR. It&#039;s the best I&#039;ve had in a LONG time.<br /><br />So there you have it - kirbynose is now a go-to guy on my list.&nbsp;

				Couldn&#039;t agree more with you!&nbsp; I snagged 4gms of his first batch a few weeks ago, and just received 2g&#039;s today.&nbsp; As long as Kirby keeps his supply up, he&#039;ll have a great future here.&nbsp; I&#039;m a coke snob, and his stuff is very good.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried Nod (excellent), Bungee (excellent), ItalianMafiaBrussels (outstanding).....and a few other fakers who sell pure bunk.&nbsp; Kirbynose knows his blow...
