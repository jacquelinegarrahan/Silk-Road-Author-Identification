				I don&#039;t think so, I will get the message &quot;Firefox can&#039;t establish a connection to the server at silkroadxxxxxxxxxx&quot; VERY frequently, I usually have to keep trying until it finally loads, and also when I&#039;m browsing the market, it will occasionally crap out and give me that message to so I have to keep refreshing till it loads again.<br /><br />I think this is just because of the anonymous connection we are using with TOR network,.<br /><br />But-- you may be right. I&#039;m trying to load SR now and it wont work after multiple tries. It usually kicks in.

				Hahahahaha, &quot;The network SR is on&nbsp; wasn&#039;t designed to handle this amount of traffic. Just keep refreshing.&quot; -- that&#039;s the worst advice ever, that&#039;s just going to keep flooding it with traffic if you keep refreshing! Take a break, walk outside and get some fresh air for an hour or so and come back and try again.

				BBB, my is intermittent -- sometimes it works, other times it doesn&#039;t. I would say it&#039;s not their PC as they can access the forums fine. My check to see if SR is down/overloaded, either check to see if you can connect to these forums or try www.startpage.com -- the &quot;hidden&quot; alternative to google. If you can connect to either of those, then your tunnel via TOR is working fine and it must be something server side.

				yeah a few hours ago it was down for me, unfortunately after I realised I had entered my details in to a phishing site by mistake!&nbsp; Came back up eventually but if you are having trouble getting in, at least you can be confident it&#039;s the RIGHT site...

				Thank you.&nbsp; That had not occurred to me and I had considered engaging in even further random wild clicking.<br /><br />Of course I&#039;ve learned.&nbsp; But in my defence there is not exactly an easily locatable central &#039;check point&#039; for the SR URL for newbies.<br /><br />That being said, I know now.
