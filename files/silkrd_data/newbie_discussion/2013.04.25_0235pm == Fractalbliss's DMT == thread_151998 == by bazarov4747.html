				I would just post a review on his page but I&#039;m not up to 50 posts.<br />The seller was great communicating with me. Polite and the product arrived on time and weighed out. He&#039;s a new seller. I have nothing to do with him other than a purchase. Wanted to put his name out there though<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c7be494993

				Fractalbliss is a great vendor.&nbsp; My order was shipped almost immediately and arrived intelligently disguised in just over 48 hours.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know what to expect, not having used DMT before.&nbsp; I covered the top of a small bowl of trees, probably about 75 mg.&nbsp; <br /><br />1st toke: Almost immediately the room got brighter and anything in my field of vision appeared wavy.&nbsp; I laid back and closed my eyes and saw loopy red and orange kaleidoscopey pulsating shapes.&nbsp; Everything got very quiet for a few minutes as I watched and could feel the visualizations as a warm massage feeling.&nbsp; I was having trouble keeping my eyes closed and the light in the room was distracting and was also making a mildly annoying hum, so I got up to turn it off and took a second hit.<br /><br />2nd toke: Laid back down and saw more looping colorful swirls then started having flashes from a few different scenes which settled into the slow construction in my minds eye of a floating tent/canopy/stage which blossomed into a Shiva character all of this was on the back of an elephant and was spinning and radiating different colors.&nbsp; Primarily an intense neon purple.&nbsp; I could still see this with open eyes and understood 3rd eye visions.&nbsp; I was coming back down so felt connected to reality, but knew in my mind there was a place of unimaginable enormity and power.<br /><br />Anyway, thank you to Fractalbliss.&nbsp; I am an extremely satisfied customer.

				I &quot;died&quot; today, and it was the most significant thing to happen to me in my life.<br /><br />I undertand the sybology of a baptism in religon; letting your ego die, letting fear go, and embracing the infanate love all around us.<br /><br />I understand pain, and why it is nessisarry to heal. Nothing about this experience can be described as &quot;fun&quot;. In all reality death kinda hurts if your body is still alive. haha Whatever your vice, if you just give it up to love you will have true freedom.<br /><br />Sorry if this seems like a bunch of incoherent babblings, but I hope everyone else who does the Pharma can experience what I have.<br /><br />Let&#039;s start from the beginning. (Of my old life)<br /><br />I was raised by my mom since I was 3, and on some sort of drug (adderall, Ritalin, and even anti-psychotics) since I was 5. Needless to say, I was very confused about how love actually worked. I mean for the longest time I tried to rationalize it with my own limited experiences so far. I literally thought nature operated out of fear, and that is really the only thing wrong with faith these days IMO. TOO MUCH FEAR, AND NOT ENOUGH LOVE! <br /><br />Fast forward to about 3 years ago. I have not had much contact with my dad or my late step mom in many years. All I really had was just some torn fragments of memories I wasn&#039;t sure what was real and what was in my head because of the pills. She had been fighting cancer for many years now.. Really since right before I lost contact for 7 years... Over the time we didn&#039;t talk because my mom&#039;s fear of my dad being some pedophile freak. I can&#039;t blame her overwhelming fear, but it&#039;s hard to show love when your parents beat you. (Her not me).&nbsp; Anyway.. I had been with a girl out of fear for about 2 years when my late step-mom passed on. I went to the memorial ceremony several states away, and I feel that was the catalyst that has driven me since.<br /><br />That day I was moved to tears... Something that hadn&#039;t happened to me without the use of drugs or booze in years... I didn&#039;t realize at the time I&#039;m empathic also. (Been having a hard time coming to grips with that one until today.) I went back &quot;home&quot; and over the next couple months tried fungus, and realized my whole life was a lie up to this point.<br /><br />Obviously this caused a very large amount of undue angst on my part, and caused me to wholesale reject faith (which is a HUGE MISTAKE), but at the same time I also learned a small lesson about what love isn&#039;t.<br /><br />So, after I break up with my ex of two years, I move back in with my mom, and looking back on it I really appreciate her sacrifice... That&#039;s another thing I was to talk about... Sacrifice.. You can&#039;t love without giving it. She ended up kicking me out because I was having unprotected sex, using drugs, and having strange people in her house. (She didn&#039;t know about the unprotected part, but I was a whore and she knew it at the time).<br /><br />This is possibly the best thing that could have happened to me actually. I moved in with this bi dude and another straight guy in a condo, and proceeded to basically be an opposite cum-dumpster. It was actually really sick and gross. Having sexual relations with women and tricking them into thinking they are getting any kind of love. I have paid already for what I did to all those girls, but still thinking about it makes me sad because I know a lot of guys and gals are in the same position. We guys have sex because it&#039;s a natural desire to reproduce, but what we fail to grasp a lot of the time is the female aspect to sex. Pure, raw, unadulterated love.<br /><br />So I&#039;m selling Molly to stay afloat (okay lets be honest, I was rolling in cash) at this point, and it&#039;s funny because I always thought that money would bring happiness. I mean that&#039;s the way it work in Hollywood right!? False, on every account. Really money without someone special to spend it on almost becomes a burden. I&#039;m sure many people on the road can agree on that. If not a burden, then a depressing factor that never let&#039;s you rest. Loneliness is the worst pain, but I&#039;ve realized that the feelings I felt drove me to start going to raves. I went to a few shows with friends, and it was okay.. I overdid some fake Molly the first time, and the second rave I had to leave early because I decided to not sleep the night before. The week after that rave I decided I had to go to another one to make up for it. It was there that I met my now-wife.<br />This is about 8-9 months ago only. We knew we were meant for each other the second we locked gaze. We tried to take each other home at the same time, and spent our first night (after coming down off the amphetamine cocktail we were both on) tripping on 25i-NBOMe, and having sex/ getting to know each other for 8 hours.<br /><br /><br />We ended up getting our own place together for various reasons other than money after just a couple months of dating, but I knew she was my completer because sex with her was unlike anyone else; and I did sleep with an old FWB before we were &quot;official&quot;, and it sucked. I also admitted aforementioned event while tripping on 5mg of 25i (yes that was a really bad idea, but it prepared me for DMT more..) She obviously had an adverse reaction, and I felt out of sync with her since the first night we met.<br /><br />In the time between that and now, I went hard on real L, had delusions from Vyvance after a 300mic LSD dose... I made me get sucked into the false part of faith again. I truly believe that we have grossly misinterpreted all the sacred texts. All they say is love until it hurts, and you will have that come back to you! The infinite does not judge or condemn, it only loves boundlessly.<br /><br />So, up to this point I&#039;ve had some really heavy doses of psychedelics, but no real positive lasting results from them. Enter Pharmahusca.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really sure what I was expecting, but it sure wasn&#039;t what happened...<br /><br />I started off vaping a trench out of my MFLB with my wife. We took the Harmalas, then 20 minutes on the dot later we took the DMT, ate a small something neutral, and attempted a short walk. I say attempted because we only made it half way out of our apartment complex before it started setting in. we barely got back before I was on the floor unable to move because of how intense my body load was. I didn&#039;t know it at that moment, but the old me was in the process of dying.<br /><br />I remember spectacular fractals in visions beyond describing. I felt like I was raising frequency VERY quickly. I was used to LSD and a gentle come up over an hour.. With this stuff it&#039;s more like a shot to the head. I got scared for a minute because I thought it might be evil spirits messing with me. It took about half of the trip to realize it was my old ego, and once it died, so did any notion of &quot;evil spirits&quot; messing with me. My wife had no real epiphanies, but I feel she was the sacrifice for my death tonight.. She ended up being really sick and puking a whole lot. (DON&#039;T EAT ANYTHING A FEW HOURS BEFOREHAND. ESPECIALLY MILK BASED THINGS!!!!!)<br /><br />I honestly fail to see how anyone can glean anything significant off smoking DMT… At least before dying the first time.<br /><br />I literally know the meaning of being born again, and I thank you FB!!!<br /><br />I don&#039;t condone/endorse bigotry, big churches who don&#039;t help local people, or any specific faith because they all have the same things to say.<br /><br />JUST LOVE.

				Hello all! I&#039;m brand spanking new to SR and Fractalbliss was my first experience dealing with anybody on here. I haven&#039;t received my spice just yet but still felt the urge to drop a couple of lines to let people know how impressed I am with Fractalbliss overall. He/she/they really took the time to make sure this noob fully understood everything. I must have asked a gazillion questions but each time I got a thorough and detailed response/explanation. With such a warm and welcoming demeanor, who wouldn&#039;t want to do business with them?!<br /><br />I will post a review of the spice once I&#039;ve experienced it... The anticipation is killing me! Lol.<br /><br />Thank you once again and keep up the fantastic work, Fractalbliss! =)

				isiz is born again! : )&nbsp; All smiles on our end as it really makes it worth it when we hear your experience.&nbsp; Words have no justice to describe what you experience on Pharma or DMT.&nbsp; We always say that words are meant to describe the reality we live in on a day to day basis but words don&#039;t make sense in the other realms.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it quite amazing to see the ego for what it really is, a bundle of conditions and thoughts nothing more.&nbsp; We hold onto them as if this is who we really are.&nbsp; To experience complete peace and love without the thoughts of who we think we are is truly amazing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pure experiencing without the mind!&nbsp; We very much appreciate you sharing your experience with others and opening up to something new.&nbsp; <br /><br />To others that are open to seeing a different perception, don&#039;t be a stranger, message us with any questions you have.&nbsp; As we have always stated, Pharma and DMT are not for everyone and should not be taking lightly.&nbsp; Be open to experiencing life differently even if it means taking a different route on your way home to work! <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ll start by saying that the product shipped quickly &amp; the prices are very reasonable. The product did arrive in a melted state but I can&#039;t fault Fractal for mother nature&#039;s work; I just popped it in the freezer for a while and it reformed just fine. 5 out of 5 on the order.<br /><br />As far as the experience, I don&#039;t want to type much of a trip report but I will say that it is some fairly potent stuff and I had a wild experience. It was everything at once both physically and emotionally &amp; trying to explain it without first fully understanding it myself wouldn&#039;t contribute much to this discussion. I will however say that for some reason (maybe an overdose) I skipped 2 stages of the trip and went directly into the 3rd stage, during which I experienced a decent amount of pain and discomfort. Despite that, I didn&#039;t once feel like it was negative or something I didn&#039;t want / need. However, I can say that if I wasn&#039;t ready for it it may have messed me up for a while so be careful with it for sure.<br /><br />All in all, a great transaction and Fractal is definitely on my go-to vendor list for DMT.
