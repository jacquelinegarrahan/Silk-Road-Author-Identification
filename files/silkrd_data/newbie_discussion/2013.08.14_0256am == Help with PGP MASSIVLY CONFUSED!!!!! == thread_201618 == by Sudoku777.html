				I&#039;m massively confused by what you are asking...<br /><br />Are you trying to recover the message you initially sent to the vendor? If so, you are out of luck.<br />Are you trying to encrypt your response? If so, just do what you did the first time.<br /><br />Perhaps you can clarify for us what you are trying to accomplish.

				I&#039;m a newb myself, and i suppose there are differences between encryption software, but I think you&#039;ve got to choose the key for both the person you&#039;re messaging and yourself.

				you should encrypt the note to yourself and the vendor, if you wish to read it again later. depending the program you use, this is as easy as checking your&nbsp; name and checking the vendors name then pressing encrypt. This way you or the vendor can decrypt it an read it

				You can only decrypt messages that you have the PRIVATE key for. If it was encrypted with the other person&#039;s public key, then you will NOT be able to decrypt it. That&#039;s the point!

(vendor tells you that you gave him the wrong address) if you didnt save the note you encrypted to him/her then you will not be able to go back and check if it truly was your fault or what.<br /><br />if you use pgp4usb this is as easy as checking your public key and the vendors public key then clicking on encrypt.
