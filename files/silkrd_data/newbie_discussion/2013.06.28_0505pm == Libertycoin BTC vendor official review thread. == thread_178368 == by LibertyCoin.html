				This review is overdue, and it was time to pay my dues for Libertycoin being so helpful.<br /><br />So there I am, fresh on the road with nothing but some cash on hand trying to score some product. I searched and searched and saw many decent and safe ways to obtain my first bitcoins. The more and more I read, the more scams I saw..which started to put me off the whole thing entirely. My first route was going to be MoneyPak but like I said before, lots of scams. I didn&#039;t want to bother with bitinstant, localbitcoins ( which seems like decent ways now) and wasnt spending enough for BST..<br /><br />I stuck my neck out there and took the risk and gave Libertycoin my new business on the road. Skeptical at first, I told him if we could work in smaller deposits instead of the whole lump sum at once. NOT A PROBLEM. Communicated very well with me and was straight forward. NOT A PROBLEM. I received my bitcoins in the time it takes to show up in your SR wallet after a deposit. NOT A PROBLEM. Libertycoin was real helpful through my first purchase of bitcoins ever and worked with me with any amount of cash I desired. NOT A PROBLEM. I would recommend anyone out there to give him a try. Great bitcoin vendor!<br /><br />Most importantly, I was so lucky to get nothing more than a 1% fee on my first purchase ever...NOT A PROBLEM :)<br /><br />Would definitely use him again in the future, thanks friend! 10/10<br /><br />~Z<br />

				The 1% fee was only for a limited time, this thread was also started on June 28th. After $15k and 3 months my site is now live http://www.cryptocap.com/. Unfortunately i only had 300 btc setup into it and was gone in 3 days. I will have at least 500 btc back in by next week once my Mt.Gox wire transfers are complete. Please take a look at it and msg me with any questions. Once I feel I can meet the demand I will create a New thread promoting it.

				I can&#039;t tell if you are legit since there is little evidence of your transactions visible on SR. I don&#039;t really buy coins anyway.<br />I just wanted to stop in and offer some thoughts to try to help you with this business that is so important to SR. You may have thought of all this already. I would create free or nearly free items for buyers to buy so they can leave feedback and people can see recent transactions have been occurring. SR hides transactions without feedback now, so it is still hard to get a feel for transaction frequency, but, I think it would help your buyers a lot.<br />You probably know by now that telling customers you will be back in the biz when you receive your Gox wire transfer is almost like telling them you may never be back in business, lol.<br />If you use a clearnet website and Gox to do Btc trading related to your sales on SR, I believe, the US Fed Govt will require personal identifying information be gathered from your customers. I don&#039;t think any vendor that tries that lasts long these days.<br />I truly wish you success in this venture and hope you find a way to remain a trusted vendor on SR for a long time.

				Yea, I hear ya NW on the gox comment, but I got a bunch now and am back in biz with what should be enough capital to keep it flowing. I appreciate the comment. The unfortunate thing is that I&#039;ve done plenty of transactions throughout my btc selling career, but mostly in person. I know the niche market is here, so that&#039;s why 1) I&#039;m trying to push to get some good feedback and 2) offering at a great price of 7% over gox! Don&#039;t hesitate and see how easy it is to make the transaction. I have accounts at most major banks for cash deposit convenience. Look forward to it!

				Took a chance with a new vendor and I am SO glad I did! I was about to pay a much higher rate to exchange my MoneyPak for BTC and I decided to use LibertyCoin because my friend bbd vouched for him. He was very fast, professional and extremely affordable. Had to email back and forth for a couple hours because I couldn&#039;t get my PGP encryption to work, he was totally understanding and patient. Then when I finally got the info to him, he got the funds into his account within just a few minutes and the BTC showed up in my account LIGHTNING FAST, within about 20mins! I was really surprised it was that quick, I was expecting to possibly have to wait a couple hours so I was extremely happy with this transaction! On top of it being so fast, the BTC actually went a little over what I thought I&#039;d be getting.<br /><br />LOOK NO FURTHER for your BTC exchanging needs!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178368.msg1567252#msg1567252">Quote from: bbd82584 on September 26, 2013, 07:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">**LC: ^It&#039;s too bad the your vendor page doesn&#039;t reflect this^&nbsp; I&#039;d be willing to purchase $.00-.01 listings for each future trade from now on so that your vendor score/reviews begin to reflect your legitimacy.&nbsp; Just a thought.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ditto.
