				I have posted about this vendor before but i completely forgot my username for the forums but I&#039;ll remember this one.<br /><br />Vendor &quot;Oliver&quot;<br /><br />I had ordered 1g of alprazolam powder from him 2 times in the past.&nbsp; Both successful. My 3&#039;d order:<br />Did not come for 3 weeks.&nbsp; I inquired and was told it was marked returned to sender.&nbsp; It was to be to delivered to a property I am only at part of the year.&nbsp; He confirmed a new shipping address.&nbsp; It never came and I was told it was sent to my texas address.&nbsp; Umm lol.&nbsp; I told him i would not be there and he had confirmed my other address.<br /><br />So.&nbsp; I stupidly placed another order hoping he&#039;d make up for it in weight.&nbsp; &nbsp;Simply never came.&nbsp; Never a reply.&nbsp; Similar feedback from others.<br /><br />Then about 3 months later he pops back up with a big long page explaining his situation and issues and that he is back and better than ever.&nbsp; I received a mass email offering 1g orders to be filled with 1.25g of oxycodone powder or 1.5g of alprazolam when he stocks back up in a week or two.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had two orders.&nbsp; &nbsp;I asked him &quot;can you just send me 2 of the .25 extra weight (.5g) of the oxy powder and then just send me my 2grams of alprazolam when he had it.&nbsp; He agreed and seemed so convincing and friendly.&nbsp; The email stated that if people went back to change their feedback to reflect his has offered to correct his errors that he would offer the afore mentioned offer.&nbsp; So i did as such.<br /><br />I received a package quickly.&nbsp; It was to be .5g of 99% pure oxycodone powder.&nbsp; My baggie said &quot;1500mg&quot;&nbsp; and it was 1550mg.&nbsp; <br />That raised suspicion since I would have been happy with .5 (a good business man does not give away 150% excess for free).&nbsp; I am not usually into pain killers and have no tolerance.&nbsp; I took a large amount to GET OFF...60mg (20mg of hydrocodone has me in cold sweats followed by high as hell).&nbsp; I felt an inital light onset and then nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I gave it to 4 different people and all 4 said they felt nothing but that initial mild onset.<br /><br />So i come back to email him.&nbsp; I see his page says &quot;in stealth mode&quot; and he has no products listed.<br /><br />My conclusion:<br />He fucked things up bad.&nbsp; Then he decided to just go out with a bang (he sold a lot of that oxy powder) and fuck over as many people as possible.&nbsp; This seems illogical because surely he would gain more from providing a legit service (his prices on powders made it by far the best route for alprazolam on silk road from the US).<br /><br />So...he got me for idk&nbsp; around $600 (i cant remember the bc conversion).&nbsp; There were many feedbacks that were changed saying he is going to make up for is issue but no accounts of doing so aside from ONE which said his package was way heavy and did not mention the quality.&nbsp; Thus I can only make such conclusions<br /><br />I have updated feedback to express this.&nbsp; <br /><br />In conclusion:<br />If he comes back....avoid at all costs.&nbsp; Questions:&nbsp; How does one get banned? He certainly should be<br /><br />ANYONE WHO KNOWS OF A SOURCE FOR HIGH QUALITY ALPRAZOLAM FROM A LONG TIME LEGIT VENDOR IN THE U.S. ....PLEASE let me know.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would prefer to avoid things coming from outside the U.S. but if the best bang for the buck comes from outside the U.S. and does not take forever I would consider that.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for any input.<br /><br />

				THat might have been me under the name i forgot before I made this name which I remember now :)&nbsp; That was before his promises of being back and better than every (his big goodbye and last big scam it is clearly obvious).&nbsp; &nbsp; Now that I&#039;m certain it&#039;s not only a scam but also potentially quite dangerous I must post again.<br /><br />either way....there IS an ongoing thread about olivers recent and potentially dangerous powders.&nbsp; i wish I could post my input because some people are still considering trying it and NO ONE should try what he sends you because no one knows what it is.&nbsp; Its&#039; certainly not oxy powder.&nbsp; Nor was his last alprazolam order alprazolam.&nbsp; If you search Oliver in all threads it will be one of the top ones.<br /><br />Aside from this warning to newbies and others, and the fact that I&#039;m kind of freaking out from taking it (one person says he is still wearing a catheter from it, but that&#039;s all the bad info i saw from that person).<br /><br />My secondary goal is to get a recommendation for the best quality, lowest priced alprazolam on silk road in the US, ideally.&nbsp; Anyone grad student with access to a lab can make this shit for pennies on the dollar so either he is sending out hazerdous stuff, is a horrible chemist, or who knows.

				I really wanted to be able to paste this in the main thread. What he sent everyone is essentially baking soda if I&#039;m not mistaken. Here is a message I sent to him confronting him about it (no response, all listings disappear shortly afterwards).<br /><br />&quot;<br />[...]<br />After sampling the product, I was a bit hesitant and confused, as I did not seem to get the right effects, and the taste was...lets say familiar for now, as I will get to that aspect in a moment. Nonetheless, I proceeded to finalize and give you a 5/5 (as of now that 5/5 is still there). Before I continue, let me prelude the rest of my message with a bit of an introduction to my background.<br /><br />I am not a novice in chemistry or laboratory techniques. Nor do I fall under the category of intermediate practitioner. I have extensive experience working in the field of organic chemistry, specifically in the area of organometallic macrocycles, and use of the aforementioned to produce catalysts, design new catalytic reactions, and produce metal organic frameworks and tuned catalytic environments. I&#039;ve assisted in the authoring and editing of many forms of chemical literature, ranging from dissertations and conference presentations, to publications in journals such as JACS, JOC, and Organic Letters.<br /><br />That being said, what you have sent me here is what we in the chemistry community like to call &quot;baking soda&quot;.&nbsp; I no longer have the luxury of access to analytical equipment, but confirming the presence of baking soda is a simple deductive matter. After various simple tests I confirmed that it was without a doubt an ionic compound which evolved a small amount of carbon dioxide and thermally decomposed into another ionic solid at a relatively low temperature of between 70-100 Celcius. Both the original and heat-borne compound rigorously evolve carbon dioxide when reacted with weak acids. PH testing confirms that both compounds were bases, with the heat reacted compound being a much stronger one. Occam&#039;s razor here. Obviously sodium bicarbonate with the thermal decomposition product of sodium carbonate. There are some kind of slight effects from it, so its possible its baking soda mixed with trace amounts of something psychoactive. (Please tell me this is not baking soda with fentanyl citrate because that&#039;s quite a dangerous idea unless you employed a ball mill to ensure a homogeneous mixture. A ball mill is really the only way to mix two solids of that dilution reliably). <br />[....]<br />&quot;<br /><br />Since he did not reply I am now posting this.

				I do not come on here often. but when I do it is to pursue oliver with the most diligence possible to get all of my original funds sent to him refunded.&nbsp; My diligence does not stop on the forums either.<br /><br />There is one person who claimed medical aid was needed after taking this oxycodone powder.&nbsp; I suppose he, like a friend of mine in the same situation, kept dosing up until they felt something.&nbsp; Certainly unwise but does not make up for this shit oliver is pulling.&nbsp; To not be granted a refund is affirmation that he is simply messing with people.&nbsp; To have two reports of medical aid needed is ..i mean....why is he even allowed to be on silk road? <br /><br />It is extremely unwise and certainly unscrupulous to send out an unknown chemical/powder in the mail.&nbsp; This guy could send anthrax next for all anyone knows.&nbsp; I&#039;m not claiming he is TRYING to hurt people.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve encountered 2 instances of him doing so.<br /><br />There is no doubt that this product is NOT oxycodone powder and any feedback saying that it is legit is likely a feeble attempt on Oliver&#039;s part to keep his feedback from plummeting.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yes,&nbsp; &nbsp; This should be posted everywhere.&nbsp; NO ONE should be buying powder from this person.&nbsp; &nbsp;FIrst the issues with the alprazolam...then a grand scheme to &quot;make up for it&quot; with oxycodone powder that the majority say is bogus.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a genius but I can see it would take a fool to order a raw powder from such a vendor.<br /><br />Oliver.&nbsp; Just refund me for the 2, 1 gram orders of alprazolam I tried for months to get from you and I will simply switch to another vendor.&nbsp; &nbsp; I will NOT change any of my feedback to 5/5 but I would raise it from one to 3.

				at the risk of sounding noobish, what is the draw for xanax powder over the pills? Is it cheaper? The pills are so fast acting that I guess I don&#039;t understand the need for powder, unless it&#039;s binder-free for snorting?

				Update.<br /><br />every day a message or two is sent to him Never a reply.<br /><br />I know you are here reading this oliverr, the lowest of the low.<br /><br />Please explain to myself and everyone why you A) send out unknown and possibly toxic chemicals in the mail (especially amidst current poisonous agents being sent to federal offices.&nbsp; &nbsp; B) sell fake/unknown and clearly dangerous substances to begin with and finally C) why have you not granted me a refund like you have so many others.&nbsp; I have a history with you that was fine until recently.&nbsp; &nbsp;The moment a refund for my 2 orders of 1gram aplrazolam is refunded the sooner I will cease the pursuit act of making everyone aware of your failures/dangerous activities and over-all shadiness.<br /><br />I will not stop,&nbsp; I will not rest....until I get every penny that is owed to me or until you are banned (and it will be quite easy to tell if you come on with a new name unless you plan on changing products that are vastly different because you stick out like a sore thumb selling what you do.<br /><br />I deserve an explanation why you still refuse to refund me back my 500 some dollars (i forget the exact amount now&nbsp; &nbsp;but there were two&nbsp; for near 250 over each).<br /><br />Either you are a&nbsp; fool or one&nbsp; who is on the fast track to ruining a good thing (if not ruined already) which sitll makes you a fool.&nbsp; .&nbsp; I do not want any gimmicks to &quot;make up for it&quot;&nbsp; I just want my my money back.&nbsp; ANd i&#039;m sure everyone is curious to know why you d not give refunds from producs hat many many say is no good.
