				So While staying in a hostel in South America (I&#039;m here doing volunteer work) a met a South African man. We shared a few drinks over the course of the night. He seemed normal enough, his hand was infected so I cleaned and bandaged it for him, drawing from my experiences as a medic. Something went horrible wrong after we came back from a walk. In two seconds the schizo flashed from joking and laughing with me to slamming a beer bottle across my face. I woke up covered in blood missing my two front teeth and nothing else. This was not a robbery. He fled the hostel while I was out cold but I got a copy of his passport from the hostelkeep. Can I do something with with this info to ruin his life like he did mine? I don&#039;t believe in getting police involved not that South American police would do shit anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Sorry to hear about that, getting a bottle broken in ones face is no joke.<br /><br />With a copy of his passport you must be able to find out where he lives. If you can be 100% sure he is alone (at least not with kids), what about throwing a molotov coctail through his window?

				There is no telling what set this guy off. South America is a dangerous place with dangerous people. With that being said, I am sure if you ask around discretely you can find someone to take care of things for a price.<br /><br />This will keep your hands clean. You will just have to deal with your conscience if any.

				Thanks for the support guys. I don&#039;t quite want to kill him but burning his house down would be a plan if he didn&#039;t live on another continent. I guess maybe I could find where he lives them perhaps order drugs to his house... possibly call the police with a tip about the drugs. <br /><br />I hate the police but this (if anything) would be what they&#039;re good for. Randomly violent schizos.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				here are your fun options<br /><br />1. call the police and show them the passport<br />2. sell it on the silk road<br />3. fill out a whole bunch of &quot;free credit score online&quot; things or other malicious data stealing thing<br />4. act important and go around asking people if they&#039;ve seen this man, as he has been distributing large amounts of drugs<br /><br />5. copy his picture and paste it all over the place with the title &quot;this man has distributed over 10000 videos and images of child pornography and is armed and dangerous, if seen, permission to shoot is authorized<br /><br />6. it has his home address on the passport, buy a huge gat and some backup and pay him a visit<br /><br /><br />enjoy my ideas.

				newguy321, i dont see how it can blow up in your face, simply state you head it on the street he was importing drugs online and wanted to file a complaint, theyll flag his adress and catch the next thing coming and you remain anonymous

				Wow what a bunch of helpless responses. What a &quot;community&quot; this is....<br /><br />If you are an American citizen (or whatever) and are assaulted in a foriegn country go straight away to the embassy. They will liaison for you with the police.

				Agreed with Shino about the embassy. <br />The other thing is, if you have the $ and or the connections, and know where he currently resides, you could always pay the right people (both LE and &#039;others&#039;) to do the right things.

				Depends if you are an eye for an eye person or not. If you are PM me. <br />If you are going the legal route take pictures and call the police or go to the embassy. Fast
