				Okay...<br />I ordered from alot of hash vendors on here but saw atlas2012 last week for the first time and thought hey this guy seems to know his shit! So Okay... WHAT THE FUCK PLEASE? Ive seen quite a few good stealth packages on the road but atlas is SHOOTING DOWN THE BIRD with his one. I would feel safe ordering to North Korea and I am a paranoid person from time to time. Now the product...Ive been a regular smoker and lived in Amsterdam for more than a decade. I ordered the sample packageee, and thoughtt &quot; Oh well, let us try the thirdd quality first and then work my way up.&quot; Now i just rolled a TINY spliff with the 3rd quality and man ARE YOU KIDDING ME? i put it out after 5 puffs because i am so damn high and smiling like a MOFO! Such a nice body and head high GODLIKE, so clear and not giving headache at all. This shit is medical grade son!!!!Damn you atlas2012, you really have the best hasje on SR. And now I am convinced to the fair-trade you mention in the description, as I know this hasj you can barely even get in our coffee shops! This stuf is even double times better than the potent shit I head back in the days in Cambodia... So you either are Bob Marley or have some high class connections to a Moroccan farm. Love your work, piece of Art. God bless you for easing my pain. MAN MY HANDS AND ARMS FEEL SO FUNNY. light and warm. gg<br /><br />

				Ordered 1st Manali on Monday evening from the UK and I am so looking forward to this hash coming. I only smoke pipes and bongs and as a result I&#039;d normally much prefer a good resin over bud. But sadly since the advent of soapbar I haven&#039;t seen any decent hash this side of Amsterdam since the mid 90&#039;s.<br /><br />So I thought I&#039;d search SR for some quality stuff and Atlas looks like the best of the best. Every single review is awesome. Normally with most sellers there&#039;s usually a couple of poor / mediocre reviews mixed in with all the good ones but not this time. Coupled with highly praised stealth packaging Atlas seems like a real pro and could well be my future go to guy.<br /><br />My only slight regret is that I didn&#039;t hold off for another 48 hours as the latest sharp rise in BTC exchange rates would have saved me an additional 0.78BTC, as most SR prices are hedged to USD, but nevermind I wasn&#039;t to know.<br /><br />As I was saying I really can not wait for this to come just like a big kid waiting for Santa. <br /><br />Atlas do you know how long shipping is currently to UK?

				Mitsubishi Man: I can assure you, you won&#039;t be disappointed. Had some of the Manali mid of December and this hash was beautiful. What a pleasant smoke, highest quality.<br /><br />I also made an order for the Manali in the night Tuesday to Wednesday, but it&#039;s still processing. I hope it get&#039;s dispatched today. Is your order also still processing?

				Was given a 3/3/4 sample pack as a Christmas present off a friend!<br /><br />The hash was some of the best I ever had.<br /><br />Will buy some as soon as I save up some coin.<br /><br />My husband smokes a lot of hash and is going &#039;exclusive&#039; with Atlas2012 for hash needs. <br /><br />Better than most of he hash I smoked during a recent stay in Amsterdam.<br /><br />I love Atlas2012!<br /><br />So will you when you try any of the 3 hashes. I like the native Moroccan No 1 hash the best.

				@thinkforyourself I ordered Monday night and it was marked as in transit the following morning. Have my fingers crossed it&#039;ll come sometime over the weekend. I think typical DE-UK postal times are about 3-5 days. Was scraping the shit out my bong tonight just to get a tiny smoke!<br /><br />When I ordered it was a toss up between Atlas and Charras Brothers from India. Charras Bros were cheaper, probably because they&#039;re sending it from source, but required FE plus package comes from further away so takes longer to reach me and they had some mixed reviews. Atlas appears to have 100% excellent reviews and good customer service which I think is worth paying that little bit extra for. Had also been considering the Culero, sold by Emerald I think, but this one looks like the winner to me.

				I&#039;ve had most of the best hash here on the road and don&#039;t usually comment because I always expect the best. <br />Sometimes it&#039;s not, or it&#039;s ok, or it&#039;s what&#039;s expected.<br /><br />Atlas&#039;s 1st Manali is superb quality, very strong!&nbsp; Expensive, but price/quality ratio is the best available.<br />A little goes a long way. The shop menu recommends that you roll it around in your palm but I&#039;ve found that if you freeze it and shave it with a medium/heavy knife, you&#039;ll get a keif like powder. Lots of surface area. Great for spliffs or pipe. Smooth clean smoke. Big Bang!<br /><br />As for shipping, although I find this point somewhat insignificant after receipt of product, good stealth and 4 business days to western America! So to the ones waiting, look out your window for the postman or check your mail.<br />Atlas also seems to have a habit of shipping heavy and not marking order &quot;in transit&quot; until a day after postmarked. Others could learn a lot from this practice.<br /><br />My only concern would be that everyone discovers this treasure shop and we&#039;re all lined up outside waiting to get in!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ordered 10g of 3rd Moroccan Rif<br /><br />...After 14 days<br /><br />Rec&#039;d 10.56, or thereabouts ;D<br /><br />In a triple sealed, perfectly secure and discrete package. <br /><br />It was a flat piece with a nice extra nugget. seemed hard and brittle right out of the pack, but softened relatively easily and soon got sticky with some handling. <br /><br />Softens, puffs up and crumbles into chocolatey flakes with minimal heating, a quick flick with your bic is all it takes.The flakes harden as they cool.<br /><br />Smokes without hot rocks, tastes nice and isn&#039;t harsh. I don&#039;t have a pipe but if you like it that way, this hash would be a good choice<br /><br />Nice trippy fun buzz, not blindingly heavy but good value. I really hope the fair trade ups is genuine because this was a professionally executed transaction and I will probably buy this product again.<br /><br />**********<br />UPDATED*******<br /><br />After smoking this for a few days, I feel I really should update my review, as what I have said doesn&#039;t really do the vendor justice. I&#039;ve been used to a really heavy bud for ages, so this didn&#039;t seem so potent at first, but it really is beautiful hash.<br /><br />&nbsp;I snapped my long slab into 2 pieces, one about 50% bigger than the other. I put the bigger piece under a hot reading lamp, so I could divide it into a piece for the weekend, a piece for after work, you know how you do...<br /><br />It got very soft very quickly and a large bubble began to form on the surface&nbsp; ;D I&#039;d obviously left it for seconds instead of nano-seconds, which is all it would have taken to make the piece pliable.<br /><br />When I picked it up it fell apart like a fresh muffin&nbsp; &nbsp;??? I figured i would be left with a load of hard,dry dusty material that would almost powder after heating but it has turned into what looks like shaved chocloate&nbsp; :P <br /><br />I rubbed the smaller bits into sticky little ricciolini shapes, they stay oily and soft in spliffs and pipes and taste excellent. The larger chunks firmed up enough to be compressed a little tighter, but I don&#039;t need the bic at all to get crumbly moist toppings for my spliffs.<br />Peace

				ok, i order 10g Manali last Monday, and 8 days later the postman had a present for me (EU). So the stealth is very secure, for sure my next order will be 50 g , with no hesitation. I think I dont need to mention about the overweight , since this is standar for Atlas with all his customers. Thx, is the least i can say.<br /><br />The hash is the best i have smoked , ever. Because where i am, hash is rare, and good hash is inexistable.. so truly thanks atlas and SR, i am so glad. <br /><br />Very nice smoke, it breaks easily with very little heat, very oily, and the high is intense and clear, while it lasts for hours. The smell of it while burning is very characteristic. I only smoked one good joint (0.3g) 5 hours ago, and i can still feel my head stoned. <br /><br />This is such a nice experience for me. Not having to deal with dealers of local black market, and getting my hash to my door... is like a dream!!!!<br />Thx to the global post, and thanks once again to atlas for the professional service. <br />My only concern is whether he gets out of stock, but really, this guy has a true connection with that farm, its not a lie, i totally believe in the fair trade. And i hope the family knows about the hash being sold on individuals on SR, we totally appreciate it.<br /><br />Love

				To Machete, I have had a lot of hash off the Road, this includes Pakistani hash, in fact, its hard to tell if the Pakistani hash is from Pakistan and also you got to look at the myriad of production methods in Pakistan. How can you tell Indian charas/hash from Pakistani? Or if its from Afghanistan? Answer, its impossible as India and Pakistan nations share the same land along the border which was put there in 47/48 as I recall. Before that there was no Pakistan, but the British formed a line to keep the religious factions from killing each other for God. Afghanistan is close by so that hash, Indian or Pakistani, I think a lot of people sell without knowing the origin. <br /><br />We should have grown more hash as odds are you won&#039;t want to kill anyone smoking good hash! <br /><br />So in short, the Atlas2012 No 1 qualities are superior to most so called Pakistani hashish. <br /><br />As for Charas, that is made by hand, people spit on the hands (sometimes) but you will be smoking some skin and other debris when smoking hand rubbed charas. I avoid it as there is a slim chance you could catch something if eaten. I&#039;ve made my own though and it was wonderful stuff if you rub the plant lightly on the resin covered top colas and the ripe buds. Also, buying hash in India or Pakistan (been there) is funny as the kids will sell you cow shit if your not onto how things are over there. Good shit? lol<br /><br />Sieved hash using a number of different sieve sizes is far better and less wasteful and purer than hand rubbed.<br /><br />Now for the Atlas2012 review with photos to come.....<br /><br />My advice to anyone who has not tried this is to go for the sample pack of the 3/3/4. Thats 3 grams each of the No 1 hashes (Manila and Native Maroc) plus 4 grams of the No 3. I&#039;ve bought a bit of the No3 for med users. Reports are glowing. I&#039;ve also partaken of the No 3 myself and am actually smoking a small joint of it now in work. Well, its Friday and the guys and girls here are already thinking of the Friday night out. This No 3 is the ideal pub hash! I like a little sly smoke outside the pub but find the No 1 qualities do not mix well with alcohol. In fact, I almost crawled home after sharing a joint of the native Maroc and drinking a few pints. The No 1 in my opinion is best used on its own. A buddy who uses coke said the No 1 wiped out the coke high! <br /><br />The No 3 is basically UK No 1 hash from the 80s. It is the usual hash we used to get here - the classic Maroc that kind of fluffs up a little when heated. You can actually crumble it in a joint by the heat of your hand or a little lick of the flame of a lighter. We used to wrap hash in silver foil to heat up so as not to lose too much THC and other cannabanoids. <br /><br />If your using med weed, try this No 3 hash in a vape. It is very different in its effects than the UK bud we see. More relaxing, and the natural grown plants it came from have no poisons on them. They are not pumped full of nutes. <br /><br />I do recall someone saying the No 3 was something they were not interested in but you would have to be a snob to turn down this excellent hash. Great daytime/work smoke. Smoking bud in work we got a telling off as that stuff you can smell half a mile away. I guess a dozen workmates have smoked the No 3. All agreed it was like the hash we used to get. For the price, Atlas2012 is offering a great deal and stocking up on some of this will give you peace of mind in the knowledge that you have a nice stash.<br /><br />The No 1&#039;s..........<br /><br />Manila No 1: Without a doubt this hash is one of THE best I have smoked online sourced and even in Amsterdam I got to say hash of this standard is not easy to get even though it might be legal! I have never seen fair trade hash in Holland or anywhere but I know a few of the Maroc shop owners do send back money to the family who send hash to them. <br /><br />The Manila does NOT need to be burnt. And this is so beautiful a hash that you do not want to spoil the taste! Simply snip off a piece with some scissors and heat up using your hand so it becomes pliable. I use my nails to put small flakes in but many roll into tiny little rolls. Either way do not burn because this hash might be rock hard when cold but you can make funny animals out of it if you like modeling hash! Trouble is it won&#039;t last long! It does go a long long way and for many here one or two joints at evening is the most likely scenario. Fantastic to come home to after a hard day dodging work. <br /><br />The Manila high is excellent as its derived from a Sativa variety. This is what I might call an art lovers hash as it would help concentration on tasks that require fine attention to detail. A buddy who actually has one of those toy train hobbies vanished into his shed for 12 hours and painted some more model houses. <br /><br />As for med use, I would always say that a Sativa for the day and Indica for the evening. This is not to say the Manila will keep you up at night! Smoke a little and hash can help you stay awake when tired. Everyone will have a dose that will do this but smoke more than that and Sativa or not its going to put your lights out because its such a high quality hashish! <br /><br />I will report back on my latest experiment for the good of the human race. I&#039;m sacrificing my time to see what effects the hash has when eaten. The plan is eat all three hashes several nights apart and report back. I also know a few med users who are in the process of eating small amounts of the Maroc native No 1 and the No 3. Amounts as low as 250mg of the No 1 are taking effect and I can see the reds of the eyes. Red eyed and smiling. <br /><br />Native Maroc No1 ....<br /><br />Two joints and gone!!!<br /><br />I&#039;ve already had a few of the sample packs so know all these hashes very very well. I&#039;d be happy to leave all other hashes alone and just have these three to see me through. :-)<br /><br />The Maroc No 1 is what I&#039;d call a stoners hash. Not a hash I would use to paint a picture but one that makes looking at art work out real well! A great music listening smoke also! Makes you get out all those old albums and CDs.<br /><br />This hits you like only the best of the best of hashes could! I can smoke with the best but I have had to leave the No 1 hashes alone in the day. We had a little session in work with this and to be honest we just had to hide away because we were too shit faced to deny being stoned. The boss smokes also which is lucky as at least he laughed when we confessed to have put out less than than 5% productivity. We had heavy machinery to use so wisely left that alone. We made up the time the next day as we all slept a great sleep. A few wives complained about the No 1! Smoke too much of this and you best take a viagra before sleep and give her permission ;-)<br /><br />Lastly but not least, the fact that this is Fair Trade Hash is an historical moment and one the media should praise. Silk Road gets bad media but few journalists believe what they write and they know their friends, colleagues and family and neighbors are using drugs of one form or another. Hash is classed as a drug, but in the scheme of things its a natural drug and one we have used for thousands of years. <br /><br />With Fair Trade hash we know the farmer is getting paid a fairer price than he would if Atlas2012 had not take the initiative and struck a deal with the actual farmer! This is future of the hash trade happening now. And for me I feel better knowing that some of my money is helping a family who are poor have a better standard of life. I am also happy for Atlas2012 to make some money because he/she/they have shown the initiative and done what I guess many people have spoken about. Fair Trade produce is a market which was once laughed at but now the tables have turned and Fair Trade products are common and the trade itself is in the billions. <br /><br />I only hope that Atlas2012 keeps on selling this fantastic hash because its THE best hash I&#039;ve had here on The Road! And that my hash smoking/vaping/eating buddies is the truth. <br /><br />Other things to know for UK...<br /><br />Postage time varies, but it always comes. I&#039;ve had a few off Atlas2012 and time varies from 5-10 days. Point is it always arrives. <br /><br />Packaging: Spot on. About as good as we get here. No flimsy packaging here! <br /><br />Communications: A pleasure to deal with. Polite and to the point. <br /><br />Issues over underweight? NEVER! Always a bit over to ensure against that I guess. <br /><br />Order with 100% confidence. Expect what I said! <br /><br />Note&gt; I enjoy other hashes off the Road but if given a choice of having just one it would be Atlas2012 No 1 Maroc native or the Manila No 1. I could toss a coin over those two. For eating, go for the No 3, in fact if you smoke UK sourced soap hash the No 3 will blow your mind and make you realise that UK sourced hash of the soap bar formula is total shit. <br /><br />You WILL NOT be disappointed with the sample pack. You could fly to Holland, pay more for a lesser hash or buy this and get it delivered to your door without having dodgy geezers in alleys say &quot;pssst, coke? V? you want? Psssss&quot;. <br /><br />Oh, one last thing, through the microscope you can see this is fine hash indeed!<br /><br />Right, almost 6.00pm, time to light one up. Hope you all have pleasant evening. With this hash, its always a pleasant evening! ;-)<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Red. (edited 11 April)

				This is rather late...<br />&nbsp;:-[ I kinda don&#039;t want to say anything nice, because the hash is going fast!<br />As far as I&#039;m concerned the manali is the best hash on the planet, at least until someone can prove me wrong. (please try)<br /><br />My second order was from this newer batch.&nbsp; It was a little harder to melt in my hand than the last stuff, but the flavour, and high are unmistakable.&nbsp; I love that I can get stoned on just a small amount.<br /><br />Half-way through my stash, I stopped in on an old friend with a joint.<br />I used about .6 of a gram of hash, and some nice hydro.<br />By the end of the joint he couldn&#039;t move, and I was feeling pretty awesome myself (I&#039;m pretty used to the weed I was smoking, so the hash was definitely the predominant instigator of my state of mind).<br />I LOVE doing that to people.&nbsp; Just showing up out of nowhere, and getting them so high they are like, WTF just happened!?!?!?&quot;<br />I hope when I go, my buddies will say, &quot;That asshole got me higher than any other person on the planet.&quot;<br />I give away abut half of what I pick up here, just in the name of spreading this amazing treat.<br />Thanks again Atlas!

				Looks like this hash is going fast!<br /><br />glad I got some of the Manila&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I just hope that Atlas gets some more stock in soon!<br /><br />And if you have bought some, smoked it (or eaten it) a review would be nice! I don&#039;t need reviews myself as I have smoked all 3 hashes for the past few months. I think Atlas had not done 300 sales when I bought. I envision more people finding this hash and once you buy you will be a fan!<br /><br />So more stock soon please!<br /><br />And if you have not tried - go for the 3/3/4 pack. If you love hash, I guarantee you will love these hashes!

				Absolutely recommend Atlas.<br />Theyre the best vendor ive came across on SR.<br />Ordered the Sample Pack and 10g 3rd grade.<br />Quality is amazing and the descriptions on his items are just spot on! You know what youll get.<br /><br />Yesterday Ive reordered again, apparently that was during this whole bitcoincrash-thing. (which went even crazier, after ive ordered, e.g. today etc )<br /><br />Since then it was on &quot;processing&quot;<br />I m not sure about this, but Atlas is one of the few if not the only one(i didnt see anyone else) who posted a statement about the crash on his vendor page.<br />Big thumbs up for that, which enhances the REALLY satisfied experience, ive had so far.<br /><br />And apparently Atlas is even going to ship, thats just amazing support guys !<br /><br />So, overall, definitely a 100+\10<br /><br />Gonna order asap he restocks !<br />

				Complete Review:<br /><br />From hitting &quot;add to cart&quot; until arrival it was about 36 hours. 10/10<br />Unpacked it, also very stealthy after the second vacuum package the smell already made me smile. <br />I dont have a exact scale, but it looks very overwheight, about 10-20%<br />After unpacking the Hash everything smells like it.&nbsp; :P<br />The smell is really soft but 100% like hash should smell.<br />Consistence a bit like chocolate, maybe a bit softer even without heating.<br />I begin with the 3rd, im smoking it with a pipe. I heated it once it got very soft and i just took a very small amount.<br />The taste while smoking is just like the smell very pleasant.<br />Even though i had a very low amount i am really high now, amazing!<br />Very clear and pleasant high.<br />This one is of superb quality, im almost too high to make another head...<br />Now im going at the 1st (Manali).<br />After i smoked a small bit of this one, i am totally stoned...<br />Its awesome, i can just advise everyone to try this!<br />The taste is just perfect..<br />When you smoke it you feel like you are on that farm in Marocco!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br />The high is incredible, music sounds so good and i wasn&#039;t that stoned in a long time.<br />Im now going to try the Native one, also small amount.<br />Very strong, but soft in taste.<br />Different high, but both are indiscribanlie good!<br />All in all i like everything about atlas2012 the communication was great, sending time great, stealth great,and quality superb and pice is 100% fair.<br />I will definitely order from you again.&nbsp; ;)<br />The best seller on SR!<br /><br />MfG ForgottenIdentity

				Dear friends,<br /><br />we understand you anger.<br /><br />but let me say, there are always two sides of the story.<br /><br />usually we have round 10-15 orders a day.<br />During the &quot;Crash&quot;, we received 100+ orders in 8 hours.<br /><br />This means that 90+ orders are made by people, who wanted to exploit the situation with the crashed bitcoin and our unhedged orders.<br />This is not fair to us.<br /><br />Then we made the mistake and canceled ALL orders, instead of selecting the panic-ones out. we are sorry for this mistake.<br />As you see on our reviews, we are full love and light traders.<br />We take care for every single customer.<br />So we will take care of every case to find a fair solution.

				As all of you guys I ordered some hash with bitcoins i bought at the price of 190 euros. Today when I got back home, first i saw that the bitcoin had dropped to 60 euros, i thought &quot;nice I haven&#039;t lost so much money&quot;. then i went on the silkroad and saw that my order was cancelled, i was disappointed, tried to buy something else but with 0.9 btc the only things i could have bought were just a couple of gr. Then I messaged Atlas To ask him what happened, I had an answer within 10 minutes, we quickly found a good deal that was just fine for me.<br />I totally agree when he says &quot;we are not Walmart&quot; this vendor is doing such a great work providing us with one of the best hash on earth. Be thankfull for what he is doing. Cannabis is not for angry people, maybe you guys should quit or something^^. Atlas is THE man on SR...<br />&nbsp; Bless.. ;)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Atlas is the most trustworthy EU vendor on SR - i have dealt with him numerous times - all thru the SR escrow system - and everytime he has exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />If you really are serious about getting the best quality product - i.e hashish - then look no further. Even his 3rd quality hashish is surprisingly strong, and such a clean and smooth taste..still produces thick plumes of white smoke - this sort of hash would sell for £25 for 3.5grams all day long in the UK. Even just smoking a single skin of this mixed with tobacco gets you very mellow indeed..far far stronger than any standard moroccan pollen...if you hold a piece in your hand it will still go soft - it still has a decent THC (oil) content - most commercial pollem is so old and dry it just is not worth smoking....whereas atlas 3rd still makes your rizla papers go all oily when you smoke it....<br /><br />i find number 3 hash is perfect for smoking before bed - it has a stronger physical hit and the number 1 hash - that may surprise you as it is cheaper you would expect it to be weaker...but it has a stronger body hit....so perfect for just chilling and watching a movie.<br /><br />whereas the number 1....well....i dream about atlas number 1 hashish......even after i have been smoking it everyday for a few weeks - even when i have the first joint of the day it is like having the first one i ever had.....i never ever get bored of smoking it....most hash or weed after i smoke it for a few days i start to get a sore head....and it no longer makes me high and happy...but i feel tired....but never ever when i smoke atlas number 1 hash.....this i know is because of the quality.....this hash is so so special.....you can just feel something different when you smoke it.....you may think i sound a bit mental...but please....i am completely sound of mind.....but every single time i have a smoke of atlas number one....it is quite special...<br /><br />&nbsp;his manali hashish quite simply the best quality hash on SR i can smoke it knowing its come from a fair trade grower to a fair trade vendor...to a very happy buyer.<br /><br />i have tried a lot of hash on the road - spanish fly, emerald, scurvy crew to name a few....and i have tried some very good quality hash..but i keep coming back to atlas...his manali hashish i would almost describe as &quot;farmers hash&quot; - i.e the sort of quality the growers keep for themselves......i have never come across such strong, clean hash even whilst in the netherlands....when you smoke it, you realise that good hash is always better than weed...everytime....the high is so so clean..its like the cocaine of hash...you can smoke a strong spliff and be soaringly high...but still manage to function completely fine...in fact for going out and getting stuff done this hash is the best i have tried.......when it is at room temperature - a sharp blade just slides thru it....like a knife thru butter.................... :)<br /><br />i have bought several 50gram blocks...and a few 10gram deals - every single order has been over-weight..and the packaging is above and beyond the usual amateur job you get from most other EU vendors - you can tell atlas is an efficient, organised and highly professional operation....i have complete faith and confidence in him....way above all other SR vendors....he really has no competition on the road imho......

Even after i attacked him with words u usually doesnt even get from ur worst enemy. I am very sorry i flipped out completely and i cant apology enough. I lost quite some money in that crash and atlas made me forget about all that crap. If i am completely honest, I personally would not have given people like myself (people who even insult me the worst way possible) any more attention and would probably even ban them from my service... Not so atlas. The guy deserves a lot of respect for what he is doing here.<br /><br />At first i focused my anger from all the shit happened the last days on atlas which was pretty unfair after thinking about it. The guy has a mega loss and kept cool as much as possible and made even more loss to make me (and others) feel good. Honestly i have never seen so much courage in my life. <br /><br />They certainly have a new full time customer.<br /><br />Hope u all have as much of a nice weekend as i do.<br /><br />Cheers<br />

				So! Finally we see the light at the end of the tunnel in this mess, the light is not another freight train coming our way, it&#039;s atlas with some premium hasch and customer care!<br />Seriously, the btc crash was unfortunate, bitcoins have been pumped up by a lot of speculative morons, trying to make easy money, thus creating this inevitable bubble to crash.<br />We need to remember, that no one is breaking any rules of Silk Road by canceling your orders. It&#039;s always up to the vendor if he wants to process it or not.<br /><br />I was also angry when my order got canceled, I also wrote an angry message to atlas.<br />Then I smoked a bong, tried to get some distance to the situation and quickly realized that atlas always had the best intentions, and of course he cannot take such a huge net loss that it would cost to send out all those crash abusing orders.<br />If you aren&#039;t satisfied at the moment, just give him some time and he will make you happy, please don&#039;t scare Silk Roads best hasch vendor away.<br /><br />When I logged in today, I had an offer in my inbox from atlas, which was way beyond what I was going to request. I&#039;m still smiling, 1 hour later.<br />I really hope that these compensations doesn&#039;t set him back too much that it hurts the re-supply of the goods we all crave. If that would be the case, I&#039;m pretty sure most of us will accept a higher price when the next batch arrives.<br /><br />Atlas, once again you show us true concern, trust and top notch customer care, I can only imagine the work you put in, going through all orders, trying to make everyone happy again. With this post, I want to state that my respect for you, is even higher than before.<br />Silk Road needs you even more than you need Silk Road.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				lets say i bought my btc 1 month ago. at 26euros.&nbsp; and after a month it worths 200euro. if i buy at the right moment, i get 10g manali (at less than 2 eyro per gram) and still have 50 euros to spend. and it crashes&nbsp; to 80 and i panic buy atlas hash, not because i lose real money, but because i am greedy enough not to be satisfied with the REAL / profited price per gram. because i hold bitcoins looking to buy 50g with 10 dollars. fucking stupid kids who is the greedy? how do you even dare to talk like this for Atlas??&nbsp; i wish i had money to donate for this guy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone that says bad words for atlas, should really go fuck off. What is the problem that you got canceled orders? did he steal your bitcoins? no, just your BTC&nbsp; have -50% value? Booo - fucking Hoo. wait until it gets back to 200, or buy now cheap bitcoins. shit happens.<br /><br />Really, its funny, noone speaks of the advantage that the money left in account rise in value, but you have problems with vendors getting rich??? if you have atlas balls, do it too.<br />Respect for atlas, <br /><br />once again, i want to thank atlas, for i have wanted to visit holland, but fortunately, i now only need to visit atlas page to bring marocco to my home. heh<br /><br />cheers, i cant wait for my next order... <br />and the fact that atlas even tries to solve every customer issue by making a special price, this alone says it all, about who is the greedy and who is not. Because he can only trust you if you say that you bought your btc at 250. He cant know it, you could have bought at 5 or 10 or 50 or anything but not 200... you should really get banned from SR for inapproprieate behaviour towards vendor. You are very lucky that atlas forgave you and offered a solution. As always, scammers cry first. <br /><br />PS: btc is not stable, you know that before ordering, so my personal advise, always buy at least 50%more&nbsp; If you can afford, for insurance in case of bubble bursts, and you are junkie as hell to get your hash?!@<br />PS2:btc makes you greedy, even if you are the most innocent on earth.<br />PS3: fuck mtgox, they spread the panic, they manipulate the price. <br />And for fucks sake, this is a review thread, if you want to spam for your 50 posts, go to a spam thread.. end.<br />

				Well, the btc crash really did put some vendors at a loss. No trader in the world can take a two thirds loss overnight so the cancellation of orders was for our own good if we want THE best hash seller to continue to trade in btc here on SR.<br /><br />I never knew the btc was crashing, but the next day I noticed my order still processing and read the Atlas2012 vendor page which explained the situation. I fully accepted that most with orders during the time frame that btc crashed would be canceled. Whether your btc cost 180 UK pounds or 40 UK pounds matters little. Anyone buying btc ought to know that it can go up or down. The recent crash was a reminder. And although some might be angry that what could buy 50 grams can now just about buy ten grams has to just chill out. Its not the end of the world! Its unfortunate but no way has Atlas2012 got any say over the btc markets.<br /><br />And for people who have been using btc for a year or more, we have had a good run also if we saved any btc. No customers complained when the btc worked for them and value increased between buying and spending. Nobody saw the crash coming so its a case of extraordinary circumstances for most traders here. What did happen is that many noticed the btc reaching a giddy height and they used vendors to offload the coins and keep the value when the drop was noticeable. <br /><br />Bitcoins are 55 UK pounds right now. In a few hours, that might go either way as the btc price has been all over the place in the past few days. I know its frustrating if you bought when they were high as 180UK pounds!<br /><br />Anyway, instead of thinking that my btc is worth little, I&#039;m happy to buy ten grams even though the btc I spend would have bought 50 grams! That, my friends, is just life. And if you think your few coins are giving you a headache, imagine how Atlas felt waking up to see the virtual money plummeting. Many vendors will keep some coin back as investment - but most obviously have to convert btc back to dollars or whatever. I doubt the Maroc farmer would be interested in a usb stick with a virtual wallet containing virtual coins! <br /><br />So, if you had a loss - accept it, move forward, lets look forward to Atlas2012 resupplying. <br /><br />Let us also hope that btc levels out again. After all, if we see swings like that on a regular basis it won&#039;t be good for btc because we need a currency that does not fluctuate so much that you might wake up the next day with bitcoins that have dropped in value so much that you will struggle to restock! <br /><br />As a regular customer of Atlas, I have no issues with the cancellation and in the long run its a good thing for us! Especially if your polite about it. Crying about &#039;your&#039; losses is selfish. Think instead of the actual hash! I don&#039;t care if I&#039;m buying 40 grams less - my concern is having the best hash in Europe in my stash box and keeping Atlas as the go-to vendor for hash. I don&#039;t even have to thnk about hash any longer! I just click on my fav list for Atlas2012, and there is all the hash I need.<br /><br />Also, Atlas2012 has been very generous to customers. Everyone got overweight. Everyone was delighted with the three hashes on offer. I even blow a trumpet for the No 3 which I&#039;m smoking right now. I&#039;d choose that over some of the No 1s stocked by other vendors.<br /><br />So, if you got an order canceled, please accept that any trader has a right to cancel under exceptional circumstances. These were exceptional circumstances and we just have to&nbsp; accept things, take whatever losses we had and basically buy the rest of this hash so Atlas2012 is back with more stock! <br /><br />I&#039;d sooner have ten grams of Atlas hash than 100 grams of the basic generic hashes sold here. <br /><br />Look forward to Atlas2012 restocking and would appreciate any news on that and if this btc crash has affected this trader.&nbsp; <br /><br />As buyers, we can get over it. Vendors can come unstuck if they sell when btc is 180 UK pounds and find they got 40 UK pounds the next day! Anyone expecting any trader to do that must be smoking too much of that No 1 in the daytime! <br /><br />So, hope all goes well for you Atlas. Ignore the abuse - thats just childish. If you lost out - so did everyone. If you think your entitled to a sale because its processing, think again. Any vendor here has the right to cancel a sale. Any regular buyer of Atlas2012 hash will accept that in this case, canceling was a case of survival. And I am not alone in wanting Atlas2012 to survive and prosper on SR. <br /><br />Now, I&#039;m at work, but have a present for the missus to grab, then I need more coin, then its some Atlas hash to order. Just try to forget about paying 180 UK pounds for your coins!&nbsp; ;D Shit happens! And you will be able to smoke the most expensive ever hash you ever smoked! <br /><br />Or you can hold onto your coins and hope they creep up to 100 UK pounds by the weekend. Right now, we don&#039;t know how it will swing. I just hope we see a cut off point of around 50 UK pounds - having btc drop any lower than 40 really makes trading a difficult thing. Despite all this, I think its possible to trade if your hedged and that btc will stablise.<br /><br />And for people really crying about losses its a rule of common sense that your drug spends ought to be based on what you can afford. <br /><br />And finally, if you think losing money is bad, try real life were losing money might well be done in a less pleasant manner with violence. Here, we don&#039;t have the worry of street deals and dodgy guys offering &#039;anything&#039; which generally means heroin, crack, dodgy hash and weed grown by 13 yr olds and the inevitable &#039;coke&#039; containing 10% coke (if your lucky) and some nasty RC plus a variety of other rubbish. <br /><br />Atlas2012 is pleasant to deal with. They would have hated canceling orders but did ask for understanding which is lacking some I guess. I think anyone with common sense will understand 100% why orders were canceled and will have to just accept it, deal with the new prices and hope Atlas2012 has not lost too much.<br /><br />Remember our losses will be 100 fold with Atlas and other vendors. SR without Atlas would be a lesser place. I&#039;ve smoked a lot of hash bought from here, I mean a lot! Between me and the posse, we have smoked our way around the world, from Pakistan, India, Afghan. South American, Mex hash, Lebanese and Maroc of every type, from the squidgy black to the crumbly pollen. I&#039;ve had one bad hash, some bag of dust which was pictured as a resiny piece of Maroc! <br /><br />Most of the hash has been really nice. Then there is Atlas2012 hash, and I swear that of all the hashes here NONE beats this one. OK, we can point to UK hash, the small quantities of outdoor and indoor. That is more powerful than any Maroc, but its a farmers hash, rarely seen outside the farmers stash box! Atlas2012 is the best foreign grown outdoor natural hash. <br /><br />Its so good, I will not grumble at buying ten grams when last week my coin could get 50 grams! Life is too short to cry about money and I&#039;ve had good luck with btc as I hoarded a few and have a buddy who sells them also. He was lucky selling of late, but so were many buyers who bought at 50 UK pounds and saw the price rise. For the past few weeks btc has been a bit of a gamble - we don&#039;t need that insecurity in the btc market but hopefully nobody has been hit to the point were they will struggle to restock. <br /><br />So, no hard feelings here. We hit a problem and all had to swallow any losses. My concern is for Atlas2012 and I&#039;m glad to have an order cancelled if it meant Atlas2012 would be left short. Its unfair to expect that and selfish also. <br /><br />So here is to a more stable btc market and I also wonder if other virtual currencies will end up replacing or complimenting the btc. <br /><br />Anyways, best just order some hash - I need the Manila for the photo shoot we got planned. <br /><br />Hash porn. Not hard core - its romantic, hashes on top of each other or side by side. Glistening in the sunshine, shining No 1s., and the No 3 with its resin shining also. I gently caress them. Stroking them. I feel the need to touch and hold, to feel the pliable surface, feel the warmth moulding the hash. I look for the Rizla, lay down the hash and gently break off a small piece. Oh baby, its time.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Best hash on the road!! All my needs for hash are 100% satisfied by this wonderful hash. I sing its praises because I love it. Everyone who I know who has smoked it has been amazed by the standard and an instant fan. If you love hash you WILL love this hash. I&#039;ll stake my rep on that - trust me people, you will be doing yourself a big favour by heeding my advice and going for this hash!<br /><br />And hey! Writing this has made work fly by! Smoking a joint of Atlas2012 No 3 has made me chill out over btc losses - you win some, you lose some, but your just a customer, a vendor has more woes that you and if your crying or being abusive because a trader won&#039;t take a loss of two thirds and more - you need to chill out and give Atlas2012 a chance to recover from the crash.<br /><br />And hey - I started writing this 3 hr ago - now the btc price is 58 UK pounds. <br /><br />Anyways, best buy this important present for the missus and something for my own stash box!<br /><br />Hope there is some left! But I got a small stash of the native Maroc and No 3 to tide me over. I have barely been smoking bud since discovering Atlas2012! I still toke on bud of course (its all over my area) but prefer this Atlas hash. Out of a few dozen hashes, this wins the prize of the most wanted hash for the stash box.<br /><br />OK, best do some real work now. I think I&#039;ll dust my monitor and clean my keyboard. Also need to think about what to cook tonight. Got to say, the No 1 native Maroc does stimulate the appetite. For med use (I pass it on to med users) its fantastic for anyone needing to gain weight. A buddy recovering from cancer has been vaping this and eating well again. Bud never has the same effect due to it being a lot weaker than hash which is the active part of the bud without the waste material and other unwanted by products that taken in by the user. Many med users have acclimatised to bud, rejecting UK sourced hash as most is nasty dangerous shit. Its great to see people enjoying hash again! Its even better when people are using for med reasons and singing the praises of it. <br /><br />Long live Atlas2012! I for one will continue to buy and will gracefully accept my losses in the btc crash of April 2013! I look forward to more hash soon! And I wish Atlas2012 all the best and hope that the crash has not hit them so hard that it affects the trade. <br /><br />I got to say, Silk Road would not be the same without Atlas!<br /><br />Nobody here gets a rating of 100 without being 100% professional, courteous and honest.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />So, hope everyone takes their losses and shrugs their shoulders and thinks about the quality of this fine hash! <br /><br />This weekend I plan to bake a cake using 5 grams of No 3 and 3 grams of No 1. Well I&#039;m not baking it but will be making the ghee butter mix to add to it. I got a few days off so will be able to get pretty stoned. I love eating hash with good company. <br /><br />I also bought a small bottle of pure coconut oil. Some talk of that being a real good oil to use with hash and oil. I guess if it does not work I can always use the coconut oil to, (censored) lol. OK, I&#039;ll go now - but I&#039;ll end on a happy note!<br /><br />This hash is fantastic! Forget about the btc markets, just be grateful we don&#039;t have to hop on a plane or boat and search Holland all over for hash that would not be of the same standard! Trust me, I know, there is plenty of good hash in Holland but for true hash lovers, it is great that we can click on a few buttons and get this hash delivered to the doorstep!<br /><br />Its just, really great that we can do this!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Thanks Atlas2012 for being the best trader on SR. <br /><br />Now, back to work, I see my mouse needs a clean also. <br /><br />Hope everyone out there is fine. Hope we get the btc stable again.

				Hi Atlas. Really enjoyed the 1st Manali I got from you the other week. The packaging was very good. The product had a lovely dark aroma to it. Almost like chocolate. Like others have stated you could see the oils bubbling away as you heated it. The flavour was lovely with a very uplifting sativa high that had very little negativity to it like other weeds can sometimes have. It also created noticeably more smoke per bong bowl so it went a long way too. Very much looking forward to trying some more.<br /><br />Can I ask if you know when you will be re-stocking again? I will be on holiday for two weeks soon but didn&#039;t know whether to order now or when I get back?<br /><br />The pros to ordering when I get back being that I&#039;m hoping for a rise in the BTC rate after stocking up on a few coins just days before the crash. Plus leaving off ordering right now, when I don&#039;t necessarily need to, gives somebody else who needs it this week an extra chance to order before stock runs out.

				What we must understand, is what caused the crash. It was the big number of speculators, people buying BTC without knowing how to use it, but persuaded that its like gold and gets high value over time.combined with&nbsp; MTgox being unable to handle many orders. This must be a lesson to all of us, we should use alternative exchange sites. Personally i am a little suspicious about MTgox.. It is Japanese bank..<br /><br />Fortunately there are other sites, much more user-friendly, and stable. For the moment, as people look mtgox for the price standard of BTC, BTC will be unstable, because mtgox is too. <br />But i definitely believe that it will soon reach 200euros again and over time, it will be only rising. the key is DON&#039;T PANIC at a crash, cause usually its created by technical lags. And even if you are think its like gold, then wait for it one year, and then check price to see if it really is. ;) many speculators bought BTC with intention to keep a long time, and yet due to the crash they panicked and sold off, just not to lose all of their investments. If they really believed in bitcoin, they should not care about the price of every day, but check once a month or so.<br />I think all this was a scene built by goverments / media / bankers.&nbsp; SO that people&nbsp; trust only fiat currencies and take this as a lesson, not to invest in bitcoins.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yes Atlas hash is the best on earth. Even smoking&nbsp; very high THC buds seems &quot; very light&quot; compared to the crazy high of Manali. I will give up weed as long as atlas sells such hash!<br />

				I did buy his 3/3/4g hash bundle a few weeks ago and the quality of the hash just blew me and my wife away. You just need a tiny little piece and two people can get high as fuck, a very funny and euphoric high, not just tired and dumb as street weed does sometimes.<br /><br />I smoked this as a sticky, with long papers and pure in my bong. It just tastes amazing and even the third grade hash is still way better than any street hash I ever got.<br /><br />I hope this vendor will sell again soon, the value you get here is really good.

Would really love to order one of those Alex Grey 10 strips from him... But until I see anything confirming the two are the same guys, I really can&#039;t make that order.

				On Friday I ordered 20 of alaskas lsd blottors to test them-&nbsp; He told in his profile that he will be offline for holiday and he will be back online on Tuesday. Thats reasonable because the post offices dont work on this monday in germany.<br /><br />Now he is for 3 Days offline, but all his listenings are not longer avaiable. The reason for this cant be the max. quantity he want to sale of the &quot;promo price listening&quot;, because i saw that it was limited to several hundrets.<br /><br />Atlas is also offline like alaska and has also no active listnings now.<br /><br />Whats happened there? Maybe the support deleted the listenings? Couldnt anyone check the signature of altas in alaskas profile and post here that its valid or not?<br /><br />I think atlas will clear up the situation tomorrow, because he will be back then.<br /><br />sorry for my bad english&nbsp; :-[

				First of all: I really love your Hashish!

Which one is more indica or sativa?<br /><br />I usually used to smoke weed, because before SR i never got good hash. I always have the same problem and asked myself &quot;How to make it small?&quot; I smoke it nearly always in joint.<br />The method that Atlas recommends (warm it in hands and then make it small) doesn´t really work for me :/<br />it´s still to big, and then the joint doesn´t burn very good and it´s (imho) very unefficient.<br />I´m using a knife and try to make a pouder of it (without heating the hash), but this is always so much work and after the first spliff i´m most of the time too lazy to do this :D haha<br /><br />Does anybody have a better methode to make the hash small enough for joints? <br />Thanks for your help :)

It is already pressed to chocolate.<br />When you take a piece between you fingers, its getting soft and you can play infinite time with it. totally sticky. when its cold its still little soft.<br />It smells fresh and fruity. When heatet, you see the surface cooking from oil. When burned purely, it burns to white ashes. The taste is soft and neutral. You get best taste when you play a little bit with it before you smoke.<br />(Picture next days, sry for delay, but my cam is missing)<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />*** FIRST QUALITY from traditional Plant: ***<br />Best original-berber product. smoked for hundred of years by the natives. The plants are native-moroc genetics and native grow-style. no sensimilla. Its also processed on 70nm screens to gold-red powder. It is already pressed to chocolate.<br />When you take a piece between you fingers, its getting soft and you can play infinite time with it. when its cold. its hard like rock.<br />It smells typical maroc. the pro&#039;s out there will recognize. When heatet, you see the surface cooking from oil. When burned purely, it burns to white ashes. The taste is intense maroc with soft smoke.<br />This is same quality we were selling last time<br />Full with Resin, soft and bubbling.

				Quick summary of my experience with<br /><br />1st Sieving Manali [Super-]Ketama<br /><br />Look: As described on the sellers page. Very flat plates, darkbrown interior, black, shiny exterior. The oils have poured out homogenously and made the surface reflect my room after I removed the plastic. <br /><br />Smell: Hashish smells like typical Ketama, chocolaty smell on the outside is noticeable but not too amplified. When you open it up it emits a smell of fresh hashish with a hint of orange. Burned it smells very herbal. <br /><br />Taste: Clear, aetheric herbal taste which leaned towards peppermint.<br /><br />Effect: Strong. This hashish produces a quite clear and very punchy body-stone that does not make you tired, eventho you become very forcedly relaxed - its not very likely, you will be cleaning your apartment after you have smoked this. Both head- and bodyhigh are rather neutral in nature, no feelings of sickness, weakness, nor stupor but also no noteworthy medical use or actual enhancements of psycho-mental functioning. This is pure, strong relaxation.<br />On a subjective note, if you have problems with headaches the head-high is one of the more &quot;luminous&quot; kinds that you feel kind of strongly in the eyes - not sure it&#039;s adviseable to use regularly for such patients.<br /><br />Overall this is a very good quality Ketama hashish, high oil content, no noticeable dirt, no additives, tasty and strong. Definitely very solid material.

				Time for Red to get some more of that wonderful fair trade hash! Its so good, I&#039;ve had to treat a few friends and colleagues. <br /><br />Although the two No 1&#039;s both excel in every area hash can excel in, I got to stand up for the No 3 because 50 grams of that No 3 has more THC in there than a nine ounce &#039;puck&#039; of the usual UK soap bar. In fact, I&#039;ll say a kilo of UK soap bar has less THC in there than the 50 gram listing of Atlas2012 No 3 hash. That is why UK soap bar goes for like 0.25 btc per oz!! Wish Atlas had a price match promise! But, the UK soap is just nasty filthy stuff and Atlas2012 is just lovely stuff.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Also, for any UK based people here, the word is that soap bar is now devoid of natural THC in many instances, they are using research chemicals in there. Avoid &#039;soap bar&#039; and watch out for the &#039;squidgy black hash&#039; also! <br /><br />I will be grabbing some hash next week so will post up the hash-porn.&nbsp; ;D I also got to say that I have looked at all the three hashes under a microscope. It looks beautiful, I wish I could be like the incredible shrinking man and sit on top of my stash! <br /><br />And anyone doubting Atlas2012, trust me this vendor is 100% honest. If you got low spends and need to FE, do so without fear. The hash will arrive. And it is a hash that is worth every penny charged. <br /><br />It does not get much better than the No 1s. But that No 3 is a gift for worktime chill outs with this sunny weather. Nice, uplifting high, nice taste, great for having a few beers with.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If your a hash lover who remembers that good old stuff from the 70s and 80s, here it is again! Only, even better!<br /><br />If your a younger smoker smoking UK soap bar, please buy a small listing of this which will make you realise UK soap bar is not even hash. The &#039;high&#039; might be anything from a glue to some research chemical.<br /><br />This Atlas hash will make you see the light. It will educate you on what good hash is. <br /><br />And fair trade is good also. Help the farmers! Those guys work hard and usually have big families and many mouths to feed!<br /><br />Right, off to the pub now, I wish you all well!

				1st Native Maroc -&gt;<br /><br />Look: Flat, red-brown interior, black outside, looking very polished and reflecting like a pond when you remove the plastic. Bit harder than the Manali but can still be worked without heat, since just like its Indian colleague the plates may be thin, but theyre certainly not overpressed.<br /><br />Smell: Typical herbal marrocan smell.<br /><br />Taste: Varied tastes alternating between lightly sweet herbal flavors and this acetous resin which remotely reminds of gooseberry.<br /><br />Effect: Ambivalent effect. This is a hash for having a grilling session or generally being outside. It creates a slightly numbing body stone with a light movement, accompanied by a rather distracted head high that amplifies peripheral perceptions, making you more open for just taking in scenery. Its actually a rather pushing high, so if sit around, dont know what to do and smoke this, you will feel even more restless after smoking this :P.

				Title: <strong>Atlas hash med uses and other praise</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>redalloverthelandguyhere</strong> on <strong>June 13, 2013, 01:50 pm</strong>

				A serious topic now, and its about med use.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure most here know cannabis has been used as both a medicine and recreational substance for thousands of years. But how many here have had dealing with med users or cared for a loved one who is ill?<br /><br />One story I&#039;ll relate (I want to keep the guy anon) he caught cancer. He was a big smoker of UK soap bar, and we all think this had a play in the cancer. I stopped smoking UK sopa bar in the early 90s. Not bought it since I went to Spain and met a gentleman whose job was to take the good hash, powder it in an industrial mixer, then add 90%+ powdered cannabis leaf! The ingredients to make this &#039;soap bar&#039; differ from gang to gang, but the real problem comes when they end up with a powder that will not just seal under a bit of heat or remain compressed in one black if they put into an industrial press.<br /><br />Some kind of &#039;glue&#039; needs to be added, molasses used to be used, but there are a variety of binders out there and most not meant to be smoked!<br /><br />The &#039;soap bar&#039; craze in the UK came from the genuine 9 ounce &#039;pucks&#039; that were common in the 80s. Most were stamped and the quality of that hash was almost as good as the Atlas hash. It was wonderful stuff until things changed. The hippy trail ended and Morrocco was visited by the usual gangsters who cut deals, at first on good hash. Then someone realised that hash was like any other powder. They could break up the blocks of hash and add more powder!<br /><br />Adding just cannabis leaf was maybe the safest way to bulk up the original hash. You could break up a gram of Atlas No 1, take maybe 3 grams of shit fan leaves off cannabis plants, soak the leaf to get the colour out a little, dry it out, powder it finely, and it will bind with the sticky goodness of Atlas2012 No 1. That way, 1 gram of hash becomes 4 grams. I actually think this 4-1 mix would work - you could repress the hash and that would be the safest form of soapbar as you have nothing too bad in there. It would of course spoil the top hash but still get you stoned. In fact, it would be seen as a good pure hash over here. <br /><br />It gets worse.<br /><br />Today, the gangs have access to hundreds of different cannabis RCs. This means that they can use the cannabis material left over after hash making - add some binder to it (industrial glue and the shit in tarmac has been found in independent tests in early 2000 via a UK pothead mag) and press out the 9 ounce pucks.<br /><br />Todays soapbar can cost a mere 180 UK pounds or even less. I&#039;ve seen an oz going for 15 uk pounds.&nbsp; Roughly 2 btc for 9 fucking ounces!!! WTF???<br /><br />Due to cannabis being illegal the actual testing of the substance is haphazard. We can get EZ tests to test for the cannabanoid RCs but there are so many cannnabanoid/THC synths out there that its a certainly that some of the soap bar is now almost devoid of any thc and the only active ingredient is some drug never tested before on people. By the time the Morrocans batter the plant after the No 3 sieving, you get mostly leaf - maybe 1-2% THC but mostly stalks not the sticky heads that contain the most THC.<br /><br />Aks yourself what happens to all those leftovers? Some gets sold on to Europeans, and likely Russians as well who are outgunning UK gangs in the illegal drug market.<br /><br />Many older people here in the UK will recall &#039;African bush&#039;, a cannabis that was brown, branchy as hell, full of seeds and you could smoke it all day and still go out and drink all night. That weak &#039;bush&#039; was usually the leftovers from Morroco, the cannabis left after the hash making process. It was brown so blended in as genuine hash when mixed with binders.<br /><br />So please stay the fuck away from soap bar hash. I&#039;m not saying there are not some great 9 ounce pucks still being made, but I&#039;ve not smoked it for 15+ years. Not bought it for 20 years. <br /><br />Now, back to the med use.<br /><br />With cancer, some patients struggle to have an appetite when they go through the treatment. My friend was diagnosed, taken into hospital and cut open. The cancer was removed but he needed radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Two years of recovery were needed.<br /><br />He was still having the odd smoke, but only UK bud, and good bud at that plus it was vaped. However, I decided to see how he would go on the Atlas2012 No 3 quality. <br /><br />We found that taking 500mg around 4.00pm each day, really helped. HE put on almost a stone more in 2 months after struggling for a few months gaining no weight. Whilst the UK bud we get is fantastic, I have always thought hash to be better at promoting &#039;the munchies&#039;, that craving to eat good food! Plus eating hash is more healthy than smoking it. And more value for money, for high for your btc.<br /><br />So, with the 500mg doses, he was eating well, even went out a few times but stuck to soft drinks as eating hash and drinking beer = falling over or ending up with some nightmare chick. We also tried out the No 1, we started at a 500mg dose and the guy likes to party. However, the 500mg dose of the No 1 native Maroc was a bridge too far. He was wasted. We ended up the atypical potheads watching nature shows till 3.00am. We ate a lot also but the guy agreed that 500mg was too much for med use. Great for getting wasted and watching ants, hippos and lions. The No 3 is a more social hash. It gets you high but not so high you just want to lay back oand become as one with the sofa.<br /><br />The 250mg dose of the No 1 was ideal. Gave a nice appetite and allowed the &#039;patient&#039; to be able to pop to the pub as he became a bit homebound at the worse of it and lost some confidence as he was not socialising. <br /><br />Its amazing how much weight the guy put on. <br /><br />Eating the hash has effects that can last for 8-12 hrs. I love nothing better than to wake up at 7/00am. get driven by the wife to some hills, and sit on the hill all day, with a big picnic, a blanket and havea bit of a mess around with the wife. Its a tourist so I&#039;m not going past first base. A few kisses and a bit of a discreet grope. I don&#039;t want ants crawling over me. I love to watch ants but hate them being on me. Some bite. No way I want a certain part of the Red bit!<br /><br />So, I&#039;m just relating that although most here seem recreational users, please think about hash as a medicine and maybe we can have others relate how hash has helped someone on the road to recovery.<br /><br />My friend has a big tolerance for hash. I would say that anyone who is thinking of using hash as a medcine for a loved one ought to start small. 100mg of the No 3 hash IS active, even I can feel it, but I&#039;m a stoner as well as med user. I&#039;d sooner eat one gram of the No 1 than pop a load of pills for pain!<br /><br />I&#039;ve also cooked with both the No 1 and No 3. All I can say is that I had my cake and ate it.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I was sitting in a room of sleeping comatose people but we added 10 grams of No 3 and 2 grams of No1 (I actually slipped in 4 grams of the No 1) 7 people partook of The Cake. I had seconds. I was so stoned I actually bounced off the walls walking home. Slept like a King! Woke and ate a full sized English breakfast. If you drive, beware that eating cannabis would come up as a positive if the police needed to take a blood sample. I&#039;d NEVER drive stoned. And eating hash, the nexy day you might feel a bit high still, which is great unless its Monday morning with police stops for all those Sunday night drinkers.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I can say thousands of years of cannabis being used as a medicine is a kind of clue that it does work!!<br /><br />Tonight, I will visit a guy who was skin and bone, barely a will to live and with no appetite he was heading towards the grave. Cannnabis enabled him to get his appetite back. Lets just say that without cannabis he may not be here alive today.<br /><br />THAT is how much of a difference cannabis can make. People die all the time after cancer treatment because they cannot eat. I&#039;ve never met anyone yet who did not toke and feel like munching on something. They don&#039;t calll it &#039;The Munchies&#039; for nothing. <br /><br />So, my buddy says thanks to Atlas, and other vendors here and the few honest ones in the real world, those old school dealers who are doing a fair deal and not selling shit bud grown by 14 yr olds in their mums loft.<br /><br />Atlas2012, its not that you allow people to party, to meet new people and break down the social barriers (hash does that) you also sell a product which can save someones life or give them more time.<br /><br />For that, you should be given a grant by the government and you could bring billions into Morrocco and into the German/EU economy.<br /><br />You deal with one farmer, there are thousands, tens of thousands of small farms there. We ant more hash they need more money. Governments stop us helping each other over a drug that will be around whether its legal or not.<br /><br />And I love fair trade. Why should we not pay a little extra knowing that someone poor can make a better life for their family.<br /><br />Atlas, you are a legend already. Any vendor wih a rating of 100 on SR is an honest trader.<br /><br />Please read the SR &#039;Trader&#039; statement if you have not done so. It describes a person of honour and sincerity. <br /><br />Atlas is/are persons of honesty and integrity. Fair trade hash is a brilliant idea. Selling good hash to people in the UK is fantastic service and I will say to any UK hash smoker that I&#039;ll send you a bitcoin IF the Atlas hash is not everything I have said it is.<br /><br />Smoking a joint of No 3 now in work. We smoke our own joints here and stash them outside for later on some little hidey place.<br /><br />Its raining here, but thats good for the outdoor growers.<br /><br />Speaking of which, any chance of listing the Native Maroc seeds or the Manilla?<br /><br />That would be cool! Fair trade seeds! <br /><br />Atlas - I take my hat off to you sir and applaud your business here which is one of the best for hash smokers.<br /><br />To anyone who has not tried, get a grip of yourself! Do yourself a favour, grab a listing, save the airfare and risk of smuggling back from Holland hoping that there are no sniffer dogs!, save money on Dutch prices and get hash better than 99% of the hash in Holland.<br /><br />I feel in a great mood today. Maybe its because we got a half day tomorrow! Guess someone will give me bad karma for that! Well, I love you anyway. Peace! Hope things work out for you!<br /><br />Atlas2012, hash that you really ought to try.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Red.<br /><br />ps sorry about the long post - helps work pass faster&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />So I&#039;m getting paid for this which is a fair deal.<br /><br />Hope its informative and helps some med users or friends and family to think about hash as a med for certain conditions. Research online for the long long list of illness and ailments cannabis can help with.

				Received the Manali 1st sieve a few days ago... And how glad I am I bought it :)<br /><br />The smoke is a bit expansive in the lungs, but not harsh at all. The taste is amazing :) it&#039;s a pretty &quot;heavy&quot; aroma.. but still fruity at the same time.<br />I remember the first time I smoked it, afterwards I thought &quot;oh well, I guess it&#039;s not THAT good, I thought I&#039;d get higher from that..&quot; and 5minutes later I was on a cloud. Definitely a creeper.<br />It sneaks up on you after a while and then for a good 30mins, it&#039;s a very strong, mental high. After that it settles down in a dreamy, relaxed high, for 2hours.<br />I&#039;d say it&#039;s an indica dominant hybrid, but not very indica-heavy, I can still be awake late in the night, not like the usual hash that puts you to sleep after an hour.<br />It&#039;s a very pleasant high, I haven&#039;t experienced any paranoia or anything. The intensity of the high can be surprising though, especially if you keep smoking because you don&#039;t feel it that much in the beginning haha.<br /><br />That&#039;s my experience with it :)<br /><br />hope I&#039;ve helped anyone with it,<br />Noom

				I drifted accidentelly into the med scene when a buddy got cancer. His treatment of chemo-therapy and radio-therapy were supplemented by a daily dose of 500mg of the Atlas2012 No 3. This hash is a mix of the Manila and Maroc Native. <br /><br />My buddy told the consultant who actually gave a thumbs up and did not mind in the least about the hash.<br /><br />&nbsp;The hash helps on a number of levels for many who might have cancer. The main thing is that it promotes an appetitite as some treatment makes it hard to actually eat. The main battle then is getting enough nutrition into the patient to help him or her cope with the fairly traumatic experience of chemo and radio threrapy.<br /><br />So far, this guy has put on a stone of weight. The treatment has worked so far and its down to 6 monthly check ups which is good news for anyone getting this treatment. <br /><br />Due to the guy going for the chemo and radiotherapy he met a lot of other people and a good percentage were either using cannabis or thinking about it. Consultants know that cannabis promotes appetitite and can help you cope with the nausea caused by either of the treatments but both together its more nausea.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying hash saved the life of this guy, but the consultant agrees that it certainly helped. After all, if you don&#039;t eat, your not going to be able to fight cncer as well as if you eat! Its that simple!<br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t know any other drugs which make you hungry and take away nausea. Seems to me that Atlas2012 should be seen as a way to supply med users with hash that actually gives the farmers more money.<br /><br />And in the Riff Mountains, they are poor! There is no welfare system and its entirely down to the years crop that allows these people to have enough supplies to see them through. Even books for the children. Everyone deserves a cut. <br /><br />I know one thing, you need to know someone in Maroc if you want to buy from the source. You actually get the chance to inspect the bags of resin, they store it loose and brick it up to order. The Atlas2012 thin slates are ideal for posting. Saves you the bother and risk of going to Maroc as they don&#039;t like strangers nosing around up in those fields! But if you make a friend of a Maroc guy, its a friend for life. The hospitality shown by these people is renowned. They may not have much but guests are looked after very well.<br /><br />I have tried many varieties of cannabis for med use. Bud is ideal for smoking of course, but hash in a vape is even better and more healthy. The best way to use hash is eat it. My method is to use capsules, add the hash to olive oil and heat gently. You end up with a paste if your ratio is 5ml olive oil to 500mg of hash. <br /><br />Of course, you can always boil some milk, add the hash, allow it to cool, add some coffee and sugar - gulp in one, then eat a small piece of something sweet because hash always tastes bitter. Its not a flavour that you can savour! But, I admit, I like that bitter taste as I know that in 30 mins or so I&#039;ll be high! <br /><br />So, for med users in particular, go for the No 3, eat it but start off small if your not used to it.<br /><br />Atlas2012, I salute you for bring us this fantastic hash!<br /><br />I&#039;ve smoked all 3. Personal fav is the Maroc native, but that Manila, wow, its up there with the best hashes I&#039;ve ever had. <br /><br />I look forward to more purchases. Never lost a thing. As stated, postal times may differ but its the same all over. One buyers gets in 3 days, another, over 10. Either way, it will arrive! And if you have not tried this hash, you are missing out!<br /><br />UK sourced hash is often bulked up with who knows what. Boycott that &#039;soap bar&#039; shit and buy some real hash.<br /><br />Red.

				A few questions in regard to the 3rd quality:<br />- Does it soften up when warmed by hand, or does it stay rock-hard?<br />- Does it crumble or turn into a powder?<br />- The description says &quot;not much bubbling&quot;.

				Hello Atlasians,<br /><br />As someone who:<br /><br />a) Was a first time buyer on SR<br /><br />b) Chose Atlas as their vendor of choice for the 1st Manali plant<br /><br />c) Used to lurk this forum post over and over for a significant amount of time to find solace as the package&nbsp; &nbsp;had not arrived in 12+ days<br /><br />All of the above posts could not be more understated, Atlas is the real deal. <br /><br />Communication : While some messages took a little while to be replied to, this is very understandable given his reputation<br /><br />Stealth : This is absolutely awe inspiring and is not worth ruining your first experience with it<br /><br />Product : Simply mind blowing - brace yourself.<br /><br />if you are waiting for your product to arrive, be patient and take comfort in knowing that if you were told that the item has shipped, it is most definitely on the way, the global post system can vary greatly in terms of delivery times.<br /><br />Will be placing my next order soon. <br /><br />Long live Atlas and all who support the cause of a world where great cannabis should be accessible to all.<br /><br /><br /><br />

I&#039;ll feel safe when ordering from Atlas again. 5/5<br /><br />The 1st Manali is the best Moroccan i&#039;ve had so far.

				dear friends,<br /><br />if we mark it in &quot;transit&quot; means, that its in the shipping-queue. <br />we ship out most of the orders at same day. just few of them at next day.<br />if we have a delay, mostly because of we need to prepack an order, then we inform the customer individually with a message.<br /><br />hope that answers your question, bro.<br /><br />one world - one family!<br />

				I received my first order from Atlas [1st quality native hash] about a month ago.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a quick review :<br /><br />Shipping (5/5) It arrived in 7 shipping days from shipping date, which is blazing fast considering all the water separating us.<br /><br />Smoothness, vendor, etc. (5/5) No surprise, I got what I ordered, smoothly.&nbsp; No need for communication, everything was clear.<br /><br />Product quality (5/5) : I can confirm it melts before burning when you apply a flame to it, which is good.&nbsp; You can play with it after warming it up.&nbsp; Tastes really good, even better when vaporized with a little bit of weed.&nbsp; &nbsp; Seriously it&#039;s the best way to smoke hash !&nbsp; Product is also very potent.&nbsp; Nice high, even almost psychedelic sometimes.&nbsp; It messes you up but I found that the hangover is very light.&nbsp; And my brain lived great things when I mixed it with LSD (in the same night, not actually smoking LSD :))

				Anyone waiting - don&#039;t worry. I order to UK and itr can take anything from 4 days to 14 plus. Atlas1012 always sends, stealth is fantastic, its the post office that makes things take longer and when we are talking two international post offices, customs and local postal offices - it can take a while.<br /><br />Was going to write a review on the med uses of the hash - I been in a collective for a while and we supply med patients with medicine in the form of cannabis and its various derivatives.<br /><br />For now, I&#039;ll just praise the No 3 Hash - its fantastic stuff.<br /><br />The other two are lovely.<br /><br />Atlas2012 is a legend.<br /><br />For me he/they are the best vendors on SR.<br /><br />You do not get a score of 100 without being bloody good traders with quality on offer always.<br /><br />Just ordered more No 3 - I don&#039;t care how long it takes - I know it will get here.<br /><br />One last thing - the stealth has gotten way better! It was already brilliant but now its even more so.<br /><br />IF you have never tried this hash, or if you think its a bit pricey, I can say that you would be hard put to find this quality in Amswerdam. <br /><br />Saves me walking through customs with 2 oz down my crutch.<br /><br />My fav is the Maroc native No 1 - but got to say, that Manila is the fav amongst me and the guys and girls.<br /><br />Sure, you can go to the Riff Valley - meet up with someone called Mohammed (they all have that as a name, well the Muslim guys do) and likely get ripped off because over there, you need to be invited. Strangers aksing for hash, might get lucky, but most get ripped off and I reckon a few got worse!<br /><br />The Maroc people, once they accept you as a friend or trading partner, are loyal people and very welcoming. <br /><br />I&#039;m happy some of my coin goes to a family that needs it more than most here I guess.<br /><br />And, Atlas2012, they deserve every coin they make because they got off their ass and somehow made a buddy in Maroc! How? That is not our concern. All we need to know is that this hash is the best on the Road.<br /><br />There are other good hashes here, as good as sometimes, but Atlas has consitency. And they kknow what they are doing.<br /><br />As for the med use - I wil write up on that. Got some testimonials from med users, docs, specialists and even police who think med weed is illegal but not a problem as long as it kept discreet.<br /><br />Long live Atlas2012!!<br /><br />

				Hi atlas, hi folks,<br /><br />I used to be extremely happy with atlas in the past: I was a returning customer, have already ordered a couple of times and was extremely happy with the quality of the products (I tried the native, the manili and 3rd quality; all were amazing) and with the communication of atlas (there were several times I had the need of individual customer support and I received it just as if it was a very professional regular brick and mortar business). and shipping times were fine, always around 2-3 business days domestic.<br /><br />so far, so fine.<br /><br />now I have this situation: I ordered on sunday more that one week ago (8th of september) and my package hasn&#039;t arrived until today. and I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve ever had a similar situation, but for me it is like psycho-terror. I am each day awaiting the package and almost walking happily down to the mailbox and am very frustrated that it is still not in there.<br /><br />so I started to write atlas. but, unusual - compared to the other times - he doesn&#039;t answer at all. on the 10th of september he wrote in his vendor description that he had some lack of time to answer messages, so he promised to answer all requests in the next days. but this has been about a week ago, and all my messages since then have not even been read!<br /><br />I now ask myself two questions: may it be that atlas has gotten into trouble with the authorities? I don&#039;t think so, because in the feedback history there are still very recent entries which make me believe that everything is running fine.<br /><br />the other question I ask myself after finding this feedback<br /><br />&gt; My package never arrived. I think atlas2012 initiated the famous vendor scam.<br />&gt; The scam goes as following: you order, they don`t send, wait a month, then you get a 50% refund in exchange for 5/5<br />&gt; <br />&gt; In hindsight i should have given them 1/5 but live and learn.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Order on your own risk, the communication with vendor was also bad.<br /><br />is this possible? I really don&#039;t want to believe this as I really love the way atlas is making business and I don&#039;t want to question his loyalty, reliability and honesty I had experienced in the past. but due to the fact that nothing arrived after 6 business days (DOMESTIC!) and not answering my questions I&#039;m really getting suspicious...<br /><br />I would simply love to order another item, but on the one hand that would be unnecessary if the package still arrives, e.g. today or tomorrow. on the other hand: if atlas &quot;broke bad&quot; and lost his loyalty, I would not want to buy another item that might not arrive.<br /><br />please folks, give me advises.<br /><br />or atlas, I would really much appreciate if you could tell me what&#039;s up here... if you want to continue this conversation in private please let me know and we can switch back to SR privmessages...<br /><br />thanks to everyone. peace and love to you, atlas! I wanna believe that you&#039;re still &quot;on our side&quot;! I wouldn&#039;t wanna have to change my vendor as I love this one...!

				I&#039;m in the same situation like toktoktok<br />I ordered around the same time. Today is the 7th day in transit, but it&#039;s my first order with atlas.<br />I hope that it still shows up, or that he contacts us.<br />

				Please be patient, you are worried over nothing and making an unnecessary post. Atlas is a trusted vendor and if youve dealt with him<br /><br />before you know he has your back either way. The package is just on its way sometimes mail is slowed up for various reasons. About the communication its clear hes just overwhelmed with messages and doing his<br /><br />best to catchup. Atlas has always done everything for his customers so i dont think its asking a lot to just give it some time. <br /><br /><br />Atlas hashish is as good as ever. Still rocking it. I would sign down on all the praise that was written in this thread to him. A lot of love to atlas and appreciation for his work.

				Don&#039;t forget to tell us if you received it eventually.<br /><br />As they posted they had lots of messages to answer and now they are out of stock. Maybe they needed some time to sort out the last shipments etc.<br /><br />But I wonder: Doest the current offer of getting 25% extra if one orders now carry any risk if one stays in escrow? What happens if they don&#039;t deliver? October 1st is still far away and ordering now it gets pretty close to the 14-day autofinalize...

				I agree with orkssp. Just stay calm. I&#039;m confident atlas is not out here to scam anyone.<br /><br />As you can see in the recent feedback allot of packages started arriving the last few days.<br />&nbsp;<br />And 0xDEADBEEF: you can just order it in escrow so you don&#039;t risk anything. When the time is getting closer to auto-finalize you can take it to the resolution center and extend the time. <br /><br />My experiences with atlas have been very good so far, and I don&#039;t think this will change anytime soon.<br /><br />Love &amp; Light

				upfront: still nothing arrived (10th business day) and atlas has not answered yet (and not even read my messages).<br /><br />to be honest, I am worried and &quot;you are worried over nothing&quot; isn&#039;t appropriate here imho. I have spent about $160 and not received anything yet. I don&#039;t know how much money you earn, but $160 is quite an amount for me. and if the package hadn&#039;t arrived until now but atlas would&#039;ve gotten in contact with me, I probably wouldn&#039;t be worried at all. but the combination of those two things make me worry...<br /><br />but I have to repeat: I have just made the very best experiences with atlas! he has the best stealth I could imagine (ninja mode), the quality of the products are amazing (even the 3rd quality is much better than any street hash I bought!) and the customer support hast always been amazing, friendly, target oriented and helpful. I don&#039;t think that atlas is trying to scam any customers. I believe that the whole philosophy of atlas&#039; business is based on loyalty and fairness (e.g. regarding the fair trade with the manufactures).<br /><br />I have prolonged the due date by 14 days because it&#039;s coming close to auto-finalize. I&#039;ll keep you posted how this develops.

				I am also very concerned about the recent events.<br />Atlas seems to not answer recently made requests although he is online regularily and probably could calm a lot of people by just giving a quick response in either this thread or on the vendor page (as he just changed the discount rates). I do not want to accuse him of anything as he seems to be a very good vendor and as a lot of people made very good experiences with him. But as a lot of people say he cares about his customers and communication used to be good with him it feels a bit weird that he can&#039;t eliminate people&#039;s concerns with just minimal effort.<br />For me the combination of the recent lack of communication and the given discounts for current orders (which obviously should increase the current order rates) seem a bit suspicious.<br />I hope he gets in contact with his cusomers soon and that everyone gets satisfied.<br /><br />Best

				hey buddy, welcome back. glad that you&#039;re well up!<br /><br />I would very much appreciate if you could handle all the complaints about non-received packages first. It&#039;s the 16th business day since I ordered, and I still haven&#039;t received any personal message from you. so I think it would be fair if you would handle those of us, who are still waiting for answers, with higher priority.<br /><br />but anyway: good to know that we don&#039;t have to pass on atlas on silkroad in the future! some of us were already drawing weird scenarios...

				I too would like to know how atlas got on with all the preorders, Im really worried for atlas financially , im betting he had a massive amount of money in escrow after offering that 25% extra deal last month on the preorders, and the really bad thing was he was due to ship out all preorders on the 1st-2nd Oct so I believe , so he may have lost an awful lot of money if they all got shipped.. I really hope not, but i know i personally lost €3000 in escrow on atlas orders, and the worst thing is i actually asked him not to send them out until I&#039;d tested my address on something smaller (lost a small order recently -not from atlas, so wasnt sure if my address was flagged) .. so i know 100% my orders were not sent. I was so looking forward to the lovely Manali..<br /><br />Im also wondering something: lets just say the site was shut down by admins and they had time to enact the failsafe BTC return, I know the wallet address thats for BTC in account to be returned to in case of a site shutdown, but what is the story with our money in escrow, if the failsafe system works properly does the escrow BTC get returned to the buyer or the vendor in case of site shutdown?&nbsp;

				It was for sure a nice idea (and a good deal :) ) and no one could have predicted this.&nbsp; Things worked out bad this time but it could just as easily have gone the other way if they had raided a day later. <br /><br />I for one knew the risks coming onto this marketplace and certainly wouldnt ever hold any grudges over things out of everyones control. I was always willing to lose any money I exchanged for bitcoins,&nbsp; You dont swap real money for virtual money and then hand it to an anonymous escrow system to be possibly given to an anonymous vendor on an untraceable internet without knowing there are things that can go wrong..&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Its a shame but we must all get on with it and concentrate on the good things. :)

				Hi there, <br /><br />i also lost a 50 preorder with 25 % and the bc going with it. But i have to say it wasn&#039;t the first preorder i took and atlas was my trusted vendor nr. 1. nobody had seen this is going that way, so atlas is not the one to blame for. i loved the quality and secure packaging. <br /><br />sure it fucked up that the bcs are going, cause im not the richest guy :) but i hope atlas come back on another platform or maybe find another way to sell, cause i love this stuff very much and i would be thankful if we can find a way. Maybe an abo :) on the 30th september i thought i should finalize early for my trusted vendor but there this shit happens, dammit i would love to have you the bc instead of the us gouvernment. <br /><br />Anyway, i really like atlas quality, stealthy and reliability so i pray for all of us that hes coming back. you can also contact me per mail or message my pgp is listed on my account. <br /><br />wish you all the best<br /><br />harry<br /><br />

				hi friends,<br /><br />sorry for you to wait so long for our decision.<br />we did a full cleanup of all physical places, bought new pc-hardware and set up new&nbsp; insane-paranoid operating systems. currently we setup our own email and tor servers.<br /><br />and what you will really not like: we sold the full restock on bulk. so we currently can not deliver hash at the moment. please understand that we had to do this - regarding all the events that happened.<br /><br />if you find a vendor account on any market who claims to sell &quot;atlas2012&quot; hash, it is definitely a scam.<br />we will inform you in the next weeks, when we restocked again and can continue.<br /><br />FOR CONTACT:<br /><br />WE WILL POST OUR OWN .ONION LINK SOON.<br /><br />the .onion website will show our current status and our accounts on the different markets.<br />please check this thread again in 2-3 days.<br />once you bookmarked the coming link, you will have a permanent contact-data to us.<br /><br />C U SOON!!!<br /><br />much love and light<br />stay safe.

				Im glad to hear from you. <br /><br />Sure the hash topic is hard but i understand that i was necessary. Better waiting a few weeks more for the great stuff instead of never taste it again :)&nbsp; I also think improving the security and wipe out old evidence was a good decision, we dont want you in trouble. guess it was the right choice.<br /><br />im looking forward for your come back in the next few weeks. you still have my trust. <br /><br />and thx for the scam warning.<br /><br />harry

				thanks for the update. i think you are dealing with this whole situation very professionally and made the right decisions. it&#039;s good to know for us customers that all evidence of old transactions has been destroyed. i&#039;m still a little sad though for all the pre-orders money being taken away by the feds, but now it&#039;s about time to move forward.<br /><br />i hope to see your hash offers back up soon! got only a tiny little piece left! lol ;D
