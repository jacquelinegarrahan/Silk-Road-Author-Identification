				Have you tried youtube? There&#039;s some pretty good tutorials there, specifically to use PGP with SR.

				Take a look at this tutorial ( http://32yehzkk7jflf6r2.onion.to/gpg4usb/ ). It should get you started. <br /><br />If you have any questions, either ask them here or PM me, I can help you out.

				I tried that damn kleopatra shit and it sucked. I read somewhere here on these forums about gpg4usb.cpunk.de/index.html it was easy try that. Ill try to explain it like I would have wanted someone to do for me. Maybe&nbsp; you understand it to this point, but I didnt. through that program make your pgp key, your pgp key is what you give to people so they can read messages you send them. you only need to send your pgp key to them once. copy there pgp key from where every its posted, paste it in the text part of the program and select import. make a message and select you name(pgp key) and there name(pgpkey) and encrypt it. Copy the message that now has been encrypted and paste it in a message to them. Thats it. theres one or two steps I left out, but youll understand those easy. Hope this helps.

				GPG4USB has a better interface, I think. And you can stick it on a USB drive! But please, be patient with figuring out PGP. It can be a little mindfucky at first but it&#039;s worth it in the end.

				My difficulty in getting this is that it is actually quite simple, but few of the tutorials actually lay it out step by step, most assume you already know what you are doing.<br />http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/guides/shepj.html<br />This link helped me a lot.&nbsp; There are still a couple things it doesnt completely explain, but this is the one that explained it well enough for me to get it.&nbsp; It goes through mostly step by step, and includes LOTS of pictures.&nbsp;

				For me, PGP&#039;s learning curve was much easier than learning how to get bitcoin!<br />

				you have public and private key (called key pair)<br />other person has public and private key (=keypair)<br /><br />public key can be send to others (private key not!!)<br /><br />in order to send encrypted message you will have to encrypt the message with other person&#039;s public key. this makes sure that only the person which has the private key of the keypair can decrypt / read it.<br /><br />same way around.<br /><br />hope this helped

				Its too confusing for some vendors, even. So don&#039;t stress. You can learn on your own time.
