				Just to help any people new to the SR cola market, here are my experiences with the cola vendors I&#039;ve dealt with so far.<br /><br />NOD<br />An 8ball from him was the first order I&#039;d ever placed on SR. I&#039;ve picked up from him 2 more times. The prices, as everyone knows, are quite high, sky high. Customer service is beyond excellent. As slow as TOR is sometimes, he gets back to you pretty quickly and doesn&#039;t just write little blurbs. They are thought-out responses that show that he cares about his customers and his business. I&#039;ve only ever picked Express shipping and if you make the cutoff, you get it next day. It&#039;s that simple. The product comes in one big beautiful rock and little size lines give me great, smooth euphoria, no jitters, and the kind of comedown that I like (yawn, yawn, 15 minute nap, back to normal). People (including me) obviously are willing to pay the price that he sets, and I have absolutely NOTHING BAD to say about him except that somewhere inside me still cries a little bit when I pay up for his 8ball :) In any case, if you&#039;re financially ok, Nod should be one of your top choices.<br /><br />SPACEWRANGLER<br />This is one cool dude. My first order from him was just for some Xanax bars. I had just placed an order before he took down listings and he pm&#039;ed right away to let me know about his inventory issue. He is super friendly and sent me another msg once my pack was in the mail. The second order I placed was last week for some cola and xanax bars. Same little inventory issue with the Xanax but he threw in some addy&#039;s to make up for it, which was class. His stealth is fucking amazing and actually kind of funny. I saw it and it made me laugh. The cola comes in caps so for all of you that are obsessed about getting stuff in rock form you may be disappointed. HOWEVER, the cola is visibly shimmery, and the high is smooth and euphoric with a nice comedown. I hate to say this because I really like SW but I would rank his cola just a tad tad tad tad behind Nod&#039;s. But because of the price, I would say SW is the better deal. I can&#039;t stress how pleasant it is to do business with SW.. really cares about his customers and I want him to succeed so that the cola market on SR has more competition (which means better prices for the consumer).<br /><br />DRAGONCOVE<br />Sends Tracking Number right away. Bought 1g from him and product comes in little rocks and powder. People seem to be pleased with his product but, at least for me, his cola was not even close to Nod&#039;s or SpaceWrangler&#039;s. In terms of transaction and delivery, though, he is spot on and professional.<br /><br />UGS<br />Got 1G from this vendor. Shipping was on point; stealth could use a little work. No vacuum seal. Comes in a rock. The cola was good, but I would rank him behind Nod and SW.<br /><br />So, I guess the final word is if you have $ burning your pocket and want your gear RIGHT AWAY, go with Nod. But in terms of value, quality, and increments (meaning SW handles smaller orders whereas Nod only does 2G and 3.5G), SpaceWrangler should be your go to guy. Both of these vendors (Nod, SW) are legit; just depends on what exactly you&#039;re looking for and how much you&#039;re willing to spend.<br /><br />NEXT UP TO TRY IS COCAEXPRESS, who has marketed his new cola product brilliantly. The prices are the best out of all these vendors but I cannot vouch for the quality as I have not yet sampled it. I hope this helps everyone.

				Update on SpaceWrangler (second order of cola from him):<br /><br />What else can I say about this guy? His listings are down at the moment, but once they are back up you HAVE to try this stuff. I used to say this stuff was tied with another vendor (who has gone stealth so I won&#039;t mention his name anymore). But in my opinion, SpaceWrangler comes out on top. Unlike all of the other vendors I&#039;ve tried here where the coke comes hard and brittle, SW&#039;s is oily and fluffy and dissolves instantly into an oil between the fingers--no gritty bits: great sign. Obviously, these aren&#039;t exact, precise, empirical measures but they count for something. After a small nose test, extremely smooth come-up and non-existent comedown. I don&#039;t comedown that hard in general, but other vendors&#039; stuff either keeps me wired for too long (indicating active cuts) or leaves me super, super sleepy afterwards, not a bad thing. But with SW&#039;s stuff, it&#039;s just...back to baseline. Granted, I don&#039;t do rails, and I have--after being a habitual binger when younger--disciplined myself to redose only after at least 90 minutes. But... still... no jitters at all, just a smooth, mellow euphoria. The weight was on point; the stealth is unmatched. The customer service is prompt and friendly. <br /><br />Seriously, try this guy out once his listings are back up.<br /><br />-ozy

				I wanted to make every one aware that ColaExpress appears to be a fraud vendor. I can&#039;t post in the main forum for obvious reasons, so I searched out a thread where my post might been seen.<br />I made a 1 gm purchase from him after reading all his hype. No FE,great pricing,family beeswax,yada,yada,yada. His advertising was indeed very enticing. Days have gone by and nothing has shown up in the mail. <br />I did the research after the fact, in the Coke Supplier threads in the main forum, only to find that no one has received their free samples either. Dudes been MIA for 5 days as of today. Luckily for me, I made extra coin, during the price rise of the bitcoin,so it doesn&#039;t really hurt too bad, but still... When and if it goes to resolution and I ask for a full refund, will this effect my perfect buyers stats??? <br />I&#039;ve since moved on to &#039;Lexq&#039;, the vendor out of Canada. I will up date <br />-MarcoRuas

				Marcos,<br />I just read your posting.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newbie.&nbsp; I placed my first small orders about 14 hours ago with 10toes for a gram of blow and with newamerica for a gram of MDMA.&nbsp; My order page says the orders are &quot;processing&quot;.&nbsp; How long does it take to fill an order?&nbsp; 10toes wants an FE for someone with less than 5 orders.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; Do I have to finalize BEFORE I receive the product?&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand how to use PGP so I didn&#039;t use it when I placed the orders.&nbsp; <br />Will the vendors not complete my order because of this?&nbsp; Sorry for such basic questions.<br />Thanks<br />winedrinker

				FE means you have to finalize before you receive it. It will say &quot;processing&quot; until the vendor moves it on to &quot;In Transit.&quot;<br /><br />A lot of vendors require FE from new buyers to cover their ass. I don&#039;t necessarily agree with it but there are also plenty of other vendors who don&#039;t ask for FE from new buyers.<br /><br />Most vendors ask you to use PGP, but only a few 100% insist on it. If you want to figure it out, search for some tutorials, whether on clearnet or youtube. It&#039;s not that difficult once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />And Marco, I purchased a few point sample from CocaExpress as well. I know on principle I should take it to resolution but I finalized just because the $ was so little and I wanted to leave neg feedback on his vendor page. Also reported the vendor. What an incompetent dude. If he wanted to scam he didn&#039;t even do a good job of it... with the money it takes to even open a vendor account and all the time he wasted in posting on the forums... he didn&#039;t even manage to get that much $ out of it if he was trying to scam. Most likely was a dude who didn&#039;t really have as much (or any) of the product he said he had and was frantically trying to scrape together some initial capital to work with. What a dumbass. Especially since he came back on after everybody started howling and said &quot;Oh wait sorry I actually DIDNT mail out your stuff, you&#039;ll get it this week.&quot; What a laugher. But I&#039;m more of the dumbass for falling for it, even if I only lost $20 or whatever it was for a point. <br /><br />I&#039;m hearing good things about lexq but these pros will NOT f you over: MarloStanfield and SpaceWrangler. SW doesn&#039;t take orders from newbies but I believe Marlo does. Good prices too.

Your references and your list of vendors is brilliant. I&#039;m just a newbie is posting, but I have over 10 purchases with an excellent rating thus far. I shouldn&#039;t have an problem purchasing from any of the vendors you listed. I was gonna make a purchase from SW, but he had no listings. As soon as I get the Lexq package, I&#039;ll try and find this thread again and post to keep the folks updated&nbsp; &nbsp;

Sometimes the speedy shit sensitizes you to look for that jittery speedy feeling as a part of the cola high.
