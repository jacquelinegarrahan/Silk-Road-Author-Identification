You simply have to empty it of BTC, log out of it and leave it inactive for a number of months and it will be archived. Once it is archived, it is no longer accessible without a message to admins requesting access to it.<br /><br />You cannot delete a Tormail email account, to the best of my knowledge. Just delete everything in it and log out. As far as the forum goes, you can go into your &quot;show posts&quot; list and manually remove your posts (Profile -&gt; Summary -&gt; Show Posts), then delete your account in the Profile -&gt; Summary -&gt; Actions menu.<br /><br />Please make sure to remove anything that you want gone before you delete your profile as we do not delete member&#039;s posts here.<br /><br />Libertas

				There&#039;s no way to delete the SR account, but you can definitely start a new one if you&#039;d like.&nbsp; As for the forums, you can delete your account yourself, but if you want any of the posts deleted, you&#039;d need to do that manually first.

Unfortunately you cannot change your username for the forum, no. Simply delete as much as you can, delete the account and assume a new identity here.<br /><br />Libertas

				Thanks very kindly Libertas...<br /><br />I have done as per your instructions and edited out everything I wrote...<br /><br />The only extant record now is in your posts where you have quoted me...<br /><br />Any possibility that you could edit those out...?<br /><br />Sorry or the bother...<br /><br />I just want to make sure that everything I do here is 100 percent bulletproof...I am learning quite a bit and I think this technnology platorm can be 100 percent secure...the problem arises i and when we give out identifying snippets o information...even writing styles...<br /><br />Let&#039;s not fool ourselves...the surveillance state has untold resources in manpower and billions o dollars and the most sophisticated equipment that no one knows even exists...<br /><br />We must be on our guard to not give away any snippet of information that can be linked to the real web and our real identities...<br /><br />I think in cases where SR users have been compromised it is in exactly this way...careless dropping of certain phrases...that can then be linked to a real person...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Gumi...<br /><br />PS: I will be editing out the text of this message in a few minutes also...<br /><br />PPS: how do I then close this forum account...?
