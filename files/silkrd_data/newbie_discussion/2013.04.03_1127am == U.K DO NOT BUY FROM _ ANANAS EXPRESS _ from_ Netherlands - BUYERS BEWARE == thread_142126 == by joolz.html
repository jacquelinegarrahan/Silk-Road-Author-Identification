The vendor offered to make up for this by including a free extra with your next order but you stated that you did not want to.

I do not know why the administrator that was overseeing the resolution decided to award 50%; that is something that you would have to take up with them. All I can tell you is that they take both the buyer&#039;s and vendor&#039;s account histories into account, and make a decision based on all of the evidence that is presented and available to them.<br /><br />Regarding CharasBros, if you did not FE then he did not have an opportunity to take your money nor &#039;refund it&#039; as he did not have it in the first place. It was being held in escrow and the vendor cancelled the order. As a result, you received a refund. Please see the following SR Wiki entries which may help you understand why you received the amount of Bitcoin that you did when the order was cancelled:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_is_my_refund_less.2Fmore_than_I_paid.3F<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Escrow_hedge<br /><br />You have presumably read the buyer&#039;s guide so you presumably knew what would happen in the event of a cancellation. Neither Silk Road nor the vendors that trade on it are responsible for the volatility of Bitcoin. Silk Road already does its best to limit this volatility by utilising a moving 24 hour average rather than a moving &#039;last&#039; price.<br /><br />Regarding the cancellation itself, this is a free market and both vendors and buyers are free to elect to do business with whomever they wish. The commission that a vendor generates is absolutely NOT taken into account if they break the rules governing vending privileges. The reason that your report resulted in &quot;FUK ALL&quot; happening is because there was no actual issue to begin with. It seems it was a misunderstanding on your part as to how the escrow system works.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142126.msg1107943#msg107943">Quote from: joolz on May 09, 2013, 07:42 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; If there was more mods who had some sort of teeth.. me and the rest&nbsp; of sr wouldnt have&nbsp; to report&nbsp; vendors 50+ times (the button doesnt work anyway) whos kidding who here.<br />&nbsp;look at sam&nbsp; many times was he reported ? or dont you know , would be interesting to see how many times&nbsp; he,s been reported or charas (100 - 200 times)&nbsp; &nbsp;???&nbsp; can you say ....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As I stated above, we are forum moderators, not Silk Road administrators. I hope now that you understand the difference you might be less venomous towards us in the future. We are here to help the Silk Road community, and answer any questions that customers may have. We do not have access to the main site to take care of customer issues, but when things are reported to us that we feel need to be passed up the chain to administrators, they are sent without delay.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how many times any vendor has been reported, nor is it any of my business as a forum moderator. All I can say on the matter is that if you believe a vendor is scamming or posting listings for items that are prohibited, you can click the &#039;report this vendor&#039; / &#039;report this item&#039; link and detail your suspicion or issue in the area provided.<br /><br />Libertas
