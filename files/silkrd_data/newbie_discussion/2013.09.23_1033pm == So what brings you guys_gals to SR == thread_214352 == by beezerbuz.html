				I am curious as to the make up of our little community.&nbsp; Is it because you cannot find what you want locally?&nbsp; Or convenience of it delivered to your door?&nbsp; Or do you buy both locally and on SR?&nbsp; I am going to assume the quality of most people on here probably exceeds most of what society would assume a druggie to be, I know that I have been smart about it my whole life, using drugs and lots of them the whole way, but (knock on wood), staying out of any kind of trouble, not bothering anyone else with my usage and contributing to society along the way.&nbsp; I am a firm believer in letting people live their lives the way they want, and for those that can&#039;t handle it, well they are the ones that would have been eaten by a lion 500 years ago (you know natural selection), instead we make laws to protect them (drug laws, gun laws etc), and then I have to pay the price (pay high prices for mediocre drugs, and chance getting caught by the law) to pursue my own happiness,&nbsp; as the constitution provides us.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m here for the beer and the bitches!<br /><br />Whatchu think I&#039;m here for??<br /><br />Just kidding, I&#039;m here for drugs I can&#039;t find IRL, which is mainly MDMA an MDA. I&#039;m sure I could find &#039;em in town, but honestly it&#039;d probably be sourced from here, might as well just order it myself.. And the EURO price on MDMA is too good to pass up. <br />I have an IRL source for LSD, I get from him in person during Phish tour but other than that we do mail business. I prefer to get drugs IRL, its usually pretty cool humble people that deal in MDMA and LSD.

				why shop at your local mall when you can find everything you need more conveniently and cheaper at amazon.<br /><br />not my reason but probably is for the majority.<br /><br /><br />

				See that surprises me, you find it cheaper to buy here, Coke, at least in the US is pretty cheap IRL (So is the quality but that is another story), and on here it is at least twice as much (but quality is a little better than street), I definitely aint on here to save money, it is the only way I know to get it without pulling up on to a street corner somewhere and risking LE staking you out or flat out thieves that will rob you blind.&nbsp; Whatever happened to the glory days where normal people dealt high quality coke right out of their house, or down at the bar, I guess I don&#039;t know the right people anymore if they are around.&nbsp; I guess alot of them came here LOL....Either way I am pretty happy here, glad that it is around so I can partake when I feel like it.&nbsp;

				I buy on SR because I know what I&#039;m getting every time that I order from a reliable vendor. I know that I&#039;m not going to get bunk product or cut product (due to the review system) like I would potentially get on the streets, through friends, or at clubs.<br /><br />It&#039;s convenience, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and great people that keep bringing me back to order week after week.

				Good question, good thread.<br /><br />Reasons why I come here:<br /><br />1) I&#039;m a mid thirties professional and don&#039;t know anyone who sells drugs.<br />2) I know the products I buy from here will generally be of a high quality.<br />3) The prices seem reasonable.<br />4) There is a great selection of my preferred poison (weed).<br />5) It seems like a great community.<br /><br />I&#039;m really glad I found this place :-)

I hear theres a lot of heroin around, and from what people are saying theres been an influx of high quality stuff coming in causing overdoses (who knows that influx of pure could be from SR?) IDK, I don&#039;t usually associate with people who do heroin. The couple of friends I had that were occasional users, ended up getting really into and fucking over everyone for petty cash to get high. <br /><br />I could probably find decent cocaine for a good price, I have friends who sold coke for awhile and probably wouldn&#039;t mind taking me to make a few intro&#039;s to some people, but out here coke is a risky game, cops love to find it, people love to steal it. Plus I have a weird thing about selling drugs I don&#039;t personally do, I don&#039;t do it.<br /><br />MDMA is plentiful, but 90$-130$ a gram for pure crystals, also plenty of people pushing bullshit for cheap to outrageous prices. This makes it easy for me to resell, even small amounts that customs usually wouldn&#039;t bother with. I can get a handful of grams here for 20-40$ a gram, take it out to the street and sell it at 90$ gram and people be very grateful for it. <br /><br />Weed here goes for a little bit more than SR, and at quality that is hit-or-miss at times, generally lesser quality than the pics i&#039;ve seen on SR (but for all I know those pictures are better than actual stuff?) <br />I&#039;ve been tempted to buy weed off SR but it wouldnt be worth it unless I got at least a QP, an HP or LB if i was gonna do it consistently. <br /><br />I&#039;m paranoid about buying bulk herb though, I&#039;ve known many people who got busted getting shipped bulk herb..Coulda been shoddy packaging on their peoples parts, or people snitching, but its nothing I wanna risk. <br />Plus there&#039;s a lot of competition around here selling weed<br /><br />LSD was one of the first drugs I tried besides weed. A couple years ago you could get a sheet of amazing ~150ug fluff on WOW for 500$-700$, ten strip for 60$-80$, as easy as getting a bag of weed (sometimes easier honestly) <br />Nowadays we&#039;re awash in Nbome&#039;s, everyone&#039;s selling under the guise of &#039;Family&#039; shit, making the local Dead scene shady as fuck (shadier than it was before around here) <br />LSD is making a comeback here though (cus it seems like the West coast is flooded in fluff) I&#039;ve made an IRL contact who lays their own sheets, and from what I hear a couple other acquaintances are selling bomb WhiteOnWhite too. <br />It warms my heart knowing great LSD is on a come-back. Everyone who I&#039;ve dealth with it lately too has been real cool and humble, as opposed to the pretentious hippies (I say that as someone who&#039;s been considered as a hippie by most people) I had to deal with in the past to get good LSD.<br /><br /><br />Safe travels y&#039;all!

				Lack of consistent connections for most stuff except for the green trees which I can get just as cheap locally.&nbsp; When I was younger I&#039;d just hit up the club scene or festivals and be successful most of the time but not always.&nbsp; Nowadays I&#039;d feel like a creeper at some of those places I use to party at and I&#039;m not even 30 yet.&nbsp; Basically here for the cocaine, mdma, coca, lsd, mdma, and finally but not least the blow.
