				I want to buy 5 e-pills and 1-2 grams of molly but i dont know how big the packages are going to be. I just want to make sure it fits in a normal mailbox so the mailman wont leave it by my door or something. This is my first time buying from SR so that&#039;s why I&#039;m not sure.

				HEY MAN, IT&#039;S RUDE TO ASK A DUDE HOW BIG HIS PACKAGE IS!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />LOL, JK<br /><br />More than likely they will use a small flat rate box, something that will fit easily in a mailbox. That&#039;s a very small amount of product in a physical sense.

				loll ^^^^ i knew someone was going to say something like that.<br /><br />But yeah, that&#039;s what I was thinking. I figured it shouldn&#039;t be too crazy since I&#039;m ordering such a small amount. I just didn&#039;t know if each vendor did it differently or not.

				Yeah like SBF says. Will probably be in just a standard letter envelope. Don&#039;t want to go into too much detail about stealth but will defo fit through your letter box.<br /><br />Hope it all goes well. Ive had no problems in 30 purchases.<br /><br />DD

				That&#039;ll probably be in a bubble wrapped envelope, if you&#039;d only ordered molly (or powders) though it would&#039;ve been in a flat letter to be as inconspicuous as possible. Some people ship pills in bigger boxes though to somehow hide it buy it doesn&#039;t matter because of the USPI inspects it they&#039;ll find it either way.
