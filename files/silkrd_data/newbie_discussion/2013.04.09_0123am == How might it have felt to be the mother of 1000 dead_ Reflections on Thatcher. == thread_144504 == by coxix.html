				To be frank, I don&#039;t give a fuck how she felt, not during the time when her power murdered 1000 kids sailing away from battle, not when she drooled in some fucked version of living hell for her final months.<br /><br />I fucking hated her, her fucking rat son, almost as much as I despair of her legacy.<br /><br />Still, can I celebrate her death? It didn&#039;t hit me the way I thought it might. Really, I just want to hear your views, not just on the death of the consummate murderous cunt&#039;s actions, but also some of your fonder memories-poll tax, Murdoch, SAS, privatisation, the sell off of social housing, and how well all you middle class types currently relish the security she provided.<br /><br />Part of me wants to spit on her grave, part wants to wish death and suffering on no-one.<br /><br />You tell me.<br /><br />

				I understand that a lot of people hated her for various reasons, but I think overall her influence was positive. She got rid of those mines, which were nothing more than a burden on the economy and a crude form of welfare, and she reclaimed the Falkland islands from Argentina&#039;s attempt to colonise them - both pretty good achievements in my opinion. So I&#039;m certainly not participating in this vitriolic celebration of her death. It certainly doesn&#039;t make her detractors look good when they start partying in the street and talking about pissing on her grave either. I notice that kind of talk only comes from one side of the debate.

				Thanks for taking part and manning up. I&#039;m way too tangential and drunkenly discombobulated to be anything useful re: this conversation.<br /><br />That said, there&#039;s been a Global culture that&#039;s enslaved and murdered for centuries.<br /><br />I look forward to hear what you have to say that she and her political progeny have done that&#039;s positive for the people of the world.<br /><br />Death comes to the most wondrous of souls, and it is part of almost all cultures to herald it&#039;s passing. I regard the very fact that Thatcher gets mention without vitriol to be an insult to truth, while so many misunderstood souls(victims) are lost to time and forgotten.<br /><br />Please, educate me, not to why I should celebrate her death, (it&#039;s been anticlimactic) but why I should not relish in my own spiteful way her demise.<br /><br />There are many more who would wish they had her power and recalcitrance who are pathetic by comparison--cunts who should be nipped in the bud, lest we live a revolting spied-upon existence stripped of meaning..<br /><br />coxix
