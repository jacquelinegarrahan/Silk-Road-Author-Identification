				I don&#039;t have enough posts to be allowed to post on Emeralds main feedback thread.&nbsp; You can find that here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=56378.msg590251<br />I hope someone with access will copy this post to the main thread, or at least post a link back to this thread.<br />Thanks!<br /><br />I recently ordered &quot;1kg Pakistani premium &#039;TMAX&#039; soft hash&quot; from Emerald.<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5059a9c3f9<br /><br />On arrival, I noticed that the product was NOT soft hash, and appeared to me Morrocan type hash, not Pakistani.&nbsp; I messaged Emerald, asking how sure he was this was Pakistani has, as it didn&#039;t look it.&nbsp; This was his reply:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is hash from pakistani strains cultivated in Morocco, it&#039;s stated in my profile page or in the product page.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First off, this is NOT stated anywhere in the listing, or on the vendors profile page.<br />Secondly, Pakistani strains do NOT make it Pakistani hash!<br /><br />For those of you who may be unfamiliar with hash, let me break it down for you.<br /><br />In Morocco, hash is made by shaking the dried marijuana plants over a fine screen.&nbsp; The trichomes (the little crystals you see on good bud) fall off, and make their way through the screen.&nbsp; The resulting dry powder is known as kiff, or pollen (It&#039;s not actually pollen, but the term is widely used).&nbsp; This powder can be pressed into bricks of hash.&nbsp; If you look closely, you can easily see that it&#039;s composed of lots of tiny grains stuck together, almost like sandstone.&nbsp; This type of hash tends to be very hard and brittle at room temperature, and ranges in color from brown to light brown.&nbsp; It is often known as &quot;blonde hash&quot;.<br /><br />In Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, a very different process is used.&nbsp; Hash makers roll fresh buds (sometimes still on the growing plant) back and forth in the palms of their hands.&nbsp; A sticky black resin builds up on the hands, and is periodically scraped off.&nbsp; This is the hash.&nbsp; It is soft at room temperature like stiff plasticine, and much more homogeneous (it&#039;s NOT a bunch of grains pressed together).&nbsp; It&#039;s very dark brown, almost black on the outside, and a dark greenish brown inside.&nbsp; It is often known as &quot;black hash&quot;. <br /><br />Moroccan blonde hash is faster, easier, and more efficient to produce.&nbsp; Pakistani black hash is more labor intensive, slower, and inefficient, but results in much stronger hash.<br /><br />For this reason, black hash commands a higher price than blonde hash.<br /><br />Emerald knows this well.&nbsp; My kilo of &quot;Pakistani&quot; hash cost $4200, whereas his Moroccan blonds hash sells for $3000 a kilo.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if they are, in fact the same product.&nbsp; What i received was in 100g bricks with TE pressed into them.&nbsp; The side view looks exactly like the picture in his listing for &quot;1Kg Good quality &quot;Ali baba&#039;s Hash&quot; from Chaouen&quot;.&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5fcebea907<br />I&#039;d appreciate hearing from anyone who&#039;s bought his &quot;ali babba&quot; so we can compare notes.<br /><br />Reading his feedback thread on the forum, it appears that past customers did, indeed, receive soft black hash.&nbsp; It appears that Emerald ran out of this product, and instead of getting more or removing the listing, simply started shipping a cheaper product.<br /><br />The ironic thing is, this is the best blonde hash I&#039;ve ever smoked!&nbsp; He&#039;s got a great product, but it isn&#039;t the product he claimed it was, or the product I was looking for.&nbsp; As a reseller, my customers simply aren&#039;t willing to pay as much for blonde hash as for black, regardless of quality.&nbsp; There&#039;s no way I would have paid as much as I did had i known I&#039;d be receiving blonde hash instead of black, and I REALLY don&#039;t like being lied to.<br /><br />I&#039;ve asked for a $1200 refund, to bring the price i paid down to what he charges for a kilo of Moroccan.&nbsp; I will update this thread with his response. <br /><br />
