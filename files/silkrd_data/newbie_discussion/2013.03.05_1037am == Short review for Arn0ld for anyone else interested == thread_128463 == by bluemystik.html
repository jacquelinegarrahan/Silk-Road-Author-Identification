				Had an order with Oliver in the past during all the drama, went with Arn0ld last week, Placed order late Thursday Meaning It should be shipped out Priority mail Friday if he&#039;s a man on his word. Welp sure fucking enough 2 business days later (Monday) There it is in my mailbox, so stoked. started off with a nice tiny dab (def about 1-2mg i&#039;ve had lots of experience with sub 10mg powders) parachuted. 10 min later that nice perfect xanex bar feeling kicked in, def about a bar from tiny ass specks, Legit. Comparing to Oliver&#039;s powder it could just be Placebo effect but I really feel this stuff is ALOT cleaner, sometimes i&#039;d do specks of Olivers and feel nothing, othertimes it worked. A friend took 10mg of Olivers and felt nothing but she has high tolerance. They&#039;re both good IMO but now that Olivers gone Arn0ld is your man<br /><br />Shipping 5/5 He lives up to his profile standards thats for sure, that fucked will be out that of the next day for sure!<br />Product 5/5 Excactly what you&#039;d expect it to be, amazing. Volumetrically measured out some xanex candies, friends are loving em 1mg each they said they&#039;re right on point!<br />Stealth 5/5 Blended right in with the other legal Priority package I received the same day, nobody would ever think twice about it<br />Communication 5/5 even though we didn&#039;t exchange messages (no questions on mypart) I feel it is not needed, He pulled through as his profile said he would and that&#039;s sign on a top notch vendor IMO He&#039;s got my business<br /><br />So if anyone isn&#039;t retarded and can handle this powder without putting yourself in the hospital, Arn0ld is the way to go for Xanex. A tiny bit of knowledge and you&#039;ve hoy yourself bars at around 50 cents i believe? My math is probably wrong .<br /><br />My 2 cents on my experience with this vendor
