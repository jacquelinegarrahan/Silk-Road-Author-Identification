				Deep and meaningful would be about perfect.<br /><br />Would DMT be ok to do in a motel room? Salvia? LSD? Shrooms? We could walk around outside without any issues, just dont wanna trip to hard and alert anyone.

				Great way for two love birds to experience a drug in my personal opinion are good rolls, none of that meth shit, or shrooms. you really get that natural happiness from shrooms, bond like no other. MDMA just makes me confess all my secrets so that could be a good or bad thing lol
