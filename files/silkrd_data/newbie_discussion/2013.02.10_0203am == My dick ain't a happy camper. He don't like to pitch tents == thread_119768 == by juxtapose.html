				Hey y&#039;all. Anyone else like me? I don&#039;t get morning wood anymore, and my dick don&#039;t get hard too quickly. I&#039;m pretty damn young, 20 years old. I feel like I need to buy copious amounts of viagra.

				i&#039;m sure i heard that morning wood is related to needing a piss not being aroused. i&#039;m not about to do that google search though. if it&#039;s taking you longer maybe you&#039;re just wanking too much?? depression/mental health affects these things too.

				Your dick is mad at you for some reason, I read this somewhere. You have to sit down and have a serious numerous discussions about relationship, or you can divorce your dick, and replace it with a plastic surgery one. Worked for me.

I&#039;d still<br />recommend you pay a visit to your doc for complete piece of mind, one can never be too careful with their health, and never think it&#039;s too embarrassing to ask them about such a thing, it&#039;s their job, and whatever you tell him/her stays in strict confidence, that&#039;s the doctor patient confidentiality agreement. In reality, there&#039;s a very minute chance a guy of your age is going to be diagnosed with a penile dysfunction problem, don&#039;t panic or worry as that&#039;s the situation getting better of you, be the man and beat it! Remember you&#039;re not alone too, lots of men go through this stage sometime in their lives for whatever reason, it&#039;s a very common &#039;issue&#039; but it take a man to speak up about it +1 for having the courage, mind over matter, I wish you all the best :)

				Yes, in my opinion, a doctor may be advisable.<br /><br />But, you may also be experience a lock of libido due to your diet.&nbsp; I&#039;d search out Apple Cider Vinegar on the net (google it) as an adjunct to your diet as well as refraining from all fast food, empty junk food, HFCS, and white sugar.&nbsp; Also, try adding some zinc to your body as well.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp;

				When was the last time you had sex?<br />If you&#039;ve not had sex for a long while, your cock will think you&#039;ve forgotten about it. <br /><br />Obviously this is not a scientific explanation, but you get what mean. lol..

				Not using steroids? I saw that you said you don&#039;t take meds. But if you have been on cycle or anything like that for the gym; that naturally shuts down your test production in the ole testes aka balls and proper PCT should be done to get LH levels booming again.... Substances like Deca ....you won&#039;t get wood lol! There&#039;s also substances from GNC and other workout companies supplements that could be of effect if you&#039;re taking any.&nbsp; Maybe your Dr will prescribe you testosterone Enanthate or Cypionate because maybe your body doesn&#039;t produce enough. Nitric Oxide pills sometimes do work for vasculization in the penile area aha but over all it&#039;s mostly all in the ole head! I&#039;ve been there before brother but mine was caused mainly by steroid abuse, it&#039;s common man. Don&#039;t fret about it really aha !
