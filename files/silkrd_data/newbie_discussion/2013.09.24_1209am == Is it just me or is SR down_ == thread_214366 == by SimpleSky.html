				I&#039;ve been refreshing SR for over an hour and haven&#039;t caught a connection once. When I tried logging in at lunch, I got in, started doing my biz, and it just stopped responding. Spent the rest of my lunch trying to connect with zero results. Now, after dinner, I try again - and again - no connection for over an hour of trying to connect.<br />If anyone else is having this problem let me know.

				Its judgement time folk, objects you stay attached to will be destroyed for you to realise that this is a hologram and theese objects aint real since spirituality is the only thing thats real..<br /><br />My predictions is that SR will stop working kinda soon since alot ofpeople are attached to it so internet will probably go to. <br /><br />My computer started acting like it was broken, and it was when i saidto myself -fuk the computer I dont need that bullshit object, then it started working instantly..<br /><br />But you have to mean it since it will get destroyed if your attached to it. <br /><br />

				I am also unable to log in at the moment like most days during peak hours. I just think the network can&#039;t handle the traffic during peak usage hours.

				Also, keep in mind that tar can become overloaded with users, so this could be the problem as well.

				I still have no response from the site, been trying periodically for the last 5 hours. This just happens though sometimes, wait it out. It always comes back up eventually, just the nature of the beast I suppose. We can&#039;t all be winners.

				No folks, its going down now..

				She is just giving you a taste of reality since she is a part of a hologram that will not continue forever..<br /><br />She loves you thats why she lets you know what gonna happen since she will not be going on forever, neither does the internet.<br /><br />I say when the first solarstorm hit Earth after the protectionshield is lifted then the internet and Sr is gone, and the protection is getting lifted now I guess since I heard that the northen lights have changed to a something else then a horizontal energylight.. Its more vertical now since its getting lifted.<br /><br />Thats just my thoughts tho and you all know how crazy my thought are i mean look at my karma.<br /><br />Dont worry I say but prepare yourself by not getting to attached to things like Sr, internet or drugs.<br /><br />Its a time of evolution now. evolve or devolve.
