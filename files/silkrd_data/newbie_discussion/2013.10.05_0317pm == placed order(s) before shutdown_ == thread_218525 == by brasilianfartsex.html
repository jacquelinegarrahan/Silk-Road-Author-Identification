				Hey guys. So i placed an order on a QP friday with spaceshipusasafeship which he told me was set to be shipped monday and arrive between wednesday and thursday but it still hasn&#039;t arrived. I tried sending him PMs on the forums be he hasn&#039;t answered so I was wondering if you guys think that it will ever arrive or if I&#039;m being too impatient or something.<br />Thanks

				Dude, I feel your pain. I had 5 orders in transit when this happened. Supposedly they were all mailed out by Monday, I&#039;ll assume Tuesday at the latest to give an extra day. You know how vendors do sometimes though... they&#039;ll mark in transit and then not really send it for a day or two (or a week, like one guy did to me). I&#039;ve received 1/5 orders so far. I&#039;m hoping like hell the rest get here, sweatin the mail man hard as fuck. As soon as I hear that truck every day I&#039;m running outside, only to be disappointed. <br /><br />2/5 orders were mailed PRIORITY too, and one I know FOR SURE is on the way because I FE&#039;d for it and the vendor just contacted me here yesterday to let me know they were tracking it and it should&#039;ve been here YESTERDAY. WTF??? Ugh. I hate the USPS around here, SOO fucking slow.<br /><br />Anyway let us know if you get yours. I&#039;ll update if I get mine too.. who fucking knows man. Honestly I think it&#039;s safe to assume that the mail might be getting watched a little closer but I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be ok. Best of luck!

				Shit man..&nbsp; I lost 300 bucks in cannabis because of the Feds and their busybody ass behaviour.&nbsp; How the fuck can I supply the public with pre-rolled joints with no cannabis?<br /><br />Fuck the feds and our shitty US Government.&nbsp; Messing with Jack&#039;s weed was a low blow, man.

				I got several orders mailed out tuesday. I thought i was gonna lose like 500 dollars on SR. Turns out I lost nothing but the vendors took a hit a palpable hit. I&#039;m a lucky one.

				I usually place orders in my cart then transfer enough bitcoins just for what I&#039;m buying only. I&#039;m lucky I only lost like 0.09btc!

				Thanks for the support guys. Hope everyone&#039;s orders come through and keep me posted on the discussion if they do (so will I). And yeah about the transferring BTCs on the account I would only transfer enough for my order too so luckily i lost nothing on the site like so many other did but can only hope my 900$ on that QP aren&#039;t lost :/ But yeah I feel for the vendors right now they took a big hit and hopefully they were careful enough for the most part and evaded the Feds...&nbsp; What puzzles me is how they have time for silly operations like these while the government is shutting down and they haven&#039;t payed their workers in months... (I guess all the BTCs they stole from SR users will be cashed in... -_-)
