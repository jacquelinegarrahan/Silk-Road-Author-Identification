				For people of a certain state of mind - it&#039;s certainly been one of the most amazing shows ever.<br /><br />Google &#039;Family Guy Breaking Bad (and the Wire)&#039;.. most of you already know. I laughed my head off as this behavior was exactly me for months. Still, apart from the ire bit, it was so true, and can&#039;t wait for July.

				Breaking Bad is probably my favorite TV show of all time. The only others that come even slightly close for me are the shield, and the wire. BB just has such an amazing cast and a seriously badass set of writers.<br /><br />Magnets, bitch!
