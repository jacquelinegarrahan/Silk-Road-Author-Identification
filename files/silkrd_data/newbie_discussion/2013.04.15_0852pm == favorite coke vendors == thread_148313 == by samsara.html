				so far i&#039;ve tried three vendors: godofall (which was the worst i&#039;ve had), btcltd sells in dimes and requires fe but i&#039;ve ordered twice and there was no problem at all and i consider theirs pretty damn good. just received a sample from theXchange from uk in 5 days and this was really good. prices seem pretty high but it is high quality girl. any shooters bpcltd and xchange won&#039;t let you down. any one want to add their favorites would be cool. hear MarloStanfield is the guy to go to.

				Decided to pony up some serious BC and tried an 8ball of Nod&#039;s stuff. It&#039;s indeed quite excellent. I have a pretty good local connection but will use Nod&#039;s gear for special occasions.

				Have tried<br /><br />Nod<br />SpaceWrangler<br />UGS<br />DragonCove<br />MarloStanfield<br />ayesdee1080 (never know how to spell his vendor name... just look through the coke listings)<br /><br />Waiting on:<br />bcpltd (again, forget how to spell, but its the dude that sells per point)<br />CocaExpress (dubious... weird shipping issues but is a new vendor so I&#039;m willing to be patient)<br />Second order from SpaceWrangler<br /><br />DragonCove seems to get good reviews but the shit I got was not the best for the price. UGS was decent for the price.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for bang for your buck--MarloStanfield.<br /><br />If you have coins to burn, go with either Nod or SpaceWrangler... the gear I got from SpaceWrangler a week ago matched up really well with Nod&#039;s gear. He also sells grams (Nod only does 2g or 8ball), so SW is my go to vendor now. Stealth is off the charts. Friendly, communicative and his gear was FIRE. I don&#039;t know how I feel about ayesdee1080 just yet. It&#039;s a nice mellow buzz, no jitters, but also pricier than SpaceWrangler per gram. SpaceWrangler also doesn&#039;t do express shipping so if you have the coins to burn and want quality gear AND need it really quickly, go with Nod. Otherwise... give SpaceWrangler a go... I think he even sells .5g if you just want to sample.

				Only had great coke from one vendor on here and they went stealth so out of respect for them I will not mention them.. Have tried countless others with none of them really living up to the price or hype you read about in the reviews.. All local to the USA.. I will stick to my local dealers for the time being slowly trying out other US based vendors as they show up..

Received from bcpltd today. It required FE, which I&#039;ve never done and didn&#039;t really want to do until making sure the guy is legit. After seeing the feedback, I placed an order. Prompt communication--shipped exactly when he said it would ship and arrived quickly considering he ships First-Class USPS. Arrived in a few chunks and initial impressions are good. Nice, clean euphoria with no jitters. His listings were just taken down but when they go up again, I would recommend him esp. if you&#039;re just looking to buy small amounts. If anything weird happens on the comedown, I&#039;ll update. If no update, means no comedown (then again, I don&#039;t usually have comedowns because I rarely do more than 100-200mg in the course of 6 hours... When younger have had too many experiences doing 1-2g in a few hours and NEVER want to relive those experiences again :) Cola is good in small quantities). Which makes me think of my using Marlo&#039;s stuff last night. Took a medium sized line that was around 75mg and... was wired for longer than should have been (mind you I was tired after a long day too). Was wired (not speedy, almost just sort of like a caffeine wired) for a good 2 hours. It wasn&#039;t anxiety-inducing, just alerted me to the fact that there is an active cut in there. But I know Marlo&#039;s bricks turn over twice a week so you may not get this with his next batch. Don&#039;t get me wrong though :)--it&#039;s still a good product, especially at the price, which is the best on the road. <br /><br />As for CocaExpress...well... It&#039;s been an eternity since he&#039;s marked &quot;In Transit&quot;--doesn&#039;t look like this was legit, even though it doesn&#039;t look like a scam either since he is a brand new vendor who didn&#039;t require FE and was really taking a lot of time to market his product in the forums.<br /><br />Tomorrow will be receiving my second batch from SpaceWrangler, which should be excellent as the first--his listings are down but SpaceWrangler is my go-to dude.<br /><br />When I next get some coins I&#039;m going to try DrWhite, KingoftheTrill when his listings are back up, Delta11, and TambourineMan. Will update as it progresses.

				Update on SpaceWrangler (second order of cola from him):<br /><br />What else can I say about this guy? His listings are down at the moment, but once they are back up you HAVE to try this stuff. I used to say this stuff was tied with another vendor (who has gone stealth so I won&#039;t mention his name anymore). But in my opinion, SpaceWrangler comes out on top. Unlike all of the other vendors I&#039;ve tried here where the coke comes hard and brittle, SW&#039;s is oily and fluffy and dissolves instantly into an oil between the fingers--no gritty bits: great sign. Obviously, these aren&#039;t exact, precise, empirical measures but they count for something. After a small nose test, extremely smooth come-up and non-existent comedown. I don&#039;t comedown that hard in general, but other vendors&#039; stuff either keeps me wired for too long (indicating active cuts) or leaves me super, super sleepy afterwards, not a bad thing. But with SW&#039;s stuff, it&#039;s just...back to baseline. Granted, I don&#039;t do rails, and I have--after being a habitual binger when younger--disciplined myself to redose only after at least 90 minutes. But... still... no jitters at all, just a smooth, mellow euphoria. The weight was on point; the stealth is unmatched. The customer service is prompt and friendly. <br /><br />Seriously, try this guy out once his listings are back up.<br /><br />-ozy

				IMHO &quot;street&quot; coke (Let&#039;s say under 70%. But most likely 50% ish) should be called &quot;Rich mans amfetamin&quot; and cocaine above 80% should be called cocaine.<br /><br />The difference between some cut up coke that makes you jitteri and &quot;speedy&quot; VS. Ultra clean coke is like Skoda and Porsche. The high you get simply do not compare.<br /><br />You might wanna tjeck out &quot;Sukey&quot; He has some ultra clean coke. Mellow high, every line lasts really long, You don&#039;t ever feel like you &quot;need&quot; to take another line to get a buzz again. You just suddenly remember that it has ben more than 1½ hour since your last micro line. Maybe you should do another after this drink.

				I can also vouch for sukeys &quot;ultra clean&quot; very nice long lasting cocain. Besides that the vendor also are a true pro with superfast shippingtime, something that makes me a returning customer!<br />Happytimezz also have really good quality coke when i ordered a couple a weeks ago and for a really good price. The coke was like powdery snow and comes really smooth up in the pipes.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				BTW. There is a difference between &quot;strong&quot; coke and pure coke. Some ppl. with less xp. Usually get&#039;s blown back by what I would call a &quot;strong&quot; coke. Small lines may hit you fast and make you feel a bit of that coke buzz but you are &quot;jittery&quot; as hell. Not really comfortable and you are not sure why. <br /><br />Pure coke takes 10 min. or so to start kicking in and it rises slowly from there. You just start smiling.<br /><br />If you ever have to ask yourself: &quot;Hmm is this good coke&quot; It is shit.<br /><br />When it is pure you are NEVER in doubt.

The other 3 were all fine blow as well, just not quite as good . No complaints with any of them though. Marlo&#039;s was the best as far as price goes .

				godofall and ayeseadee (spelling?) are the two vendors that have come through for me. high quality gear... good melting point, good taste, clean high. my use of it is mostly medicinal: in place of adderall, i bump it in the morning and sometimes in the afternoons--never at night--and get more work done and sleep better at night.

I just had to respond to your comment on Sukeys ultra clean. <br />Although I do not doubt that you enjoy his batch #2 (66% Coke, 7%levasimol and 3% caffeine) I would say, that the ultra clean (83% Coke) is well worth the extra money. For me at least. But then again... My name kinda gave that away I guess :)<br /><br />But since the ultra clean batch it limited to 200g, the fewer that buy it = The more for me :D So I guess I should support your statement, Westb0xes. Instead of trying to justify the extra cost of the ultra clean :D

				I&#039;ve tried most of the U.S. and Canadian vendors over the past couple of years.&nbsp; There&#039;s a number of decent coke vendors right now, and to some extent people have different preferences for coke, but as long as Nod is vending, I&#039;ll happily pay the premium for what he&#039;s got.&nbsp; I&#039;m not usually very vendor-loyal, but coke is expensive, and I&#039;m sick of going for the better deal and being disappointed.&nbsp; Or in a couple of cases, overspending and getting shitty gear. Or getting scammed entirely. Nod sends me shiny, euphoric, clean chunks, just like I got on the East coast many years ago, and he sends it fast.&nbsp; Worth every penny.

				I have tried most of the domestic US vendors and Sonya has been the best so far.. They quit doing grams which is all I buy at a time so have not had it for quite some time but after spending the last few months trying others, they just don&#039;t compare.. Have not tried Nods as it is just soo damn expensive.. been considering it after seeing all the reviews, may have to next time..

				My King of the Trill review--<br /><br /><br />Worked with me when I said I needed a delay on the shipping (sent it snail mail and wanted to test the speed of that).<br /><br />Well I&#039;ll be dipped in Coca Butter...<br /><br />Communication- 10/5 Above and beyond.&nbsp; Very cool, professional, and amicable.<br /><br />Stealth- 5/5 I&#039;d say a bit above average, which is better than most here.&nbsp; Cocaine bag inside of Mylar bag inside of bigger Mylar bag.&nbsp; No smell until the little baggie was opened, but oh what a smell!<br /><br />Shipping- 10/5 Sent it snail mail and, from being &quot;In Transit&quot; it only took three days, coast to coast.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I&#039;m still waiting on a Priority package shipped same day.<br />Product- 4.5/5 Well now, let&#039;s break this down.&nbsp; Tasted phenomenal, went up the tooter brilliantly.&nbsp; My partner and I went through it in a night.&nbsp; I put some aside for two tester shots (IV).&nbsp; Dissolved easily in water, no need for heat.&nbsp; That was a good sign.&nbsp; I know the difference between a coke rush and an amphetamine rush.&nbsp; This was definitely cocaine, but not terribly strong (tried a small dose and a really high dose).&nbsp; Might be better if I had used silly amounts of it, but I wasn&#039;t trying to stop my heart :P<br /><br />If you like to boot, it&#039;s still pretty much worth it.&nbsp; Try an average dose and gauge accordingly.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have enough to find my sweet spot with it, but it was definitely real and good.<br /><br />For sniffers?&nbsp; BUY THIS UP.&nbsp; Seriously, if I weren&#039;t so poor, I&#039;d get back on this right now.<br /><br />Overall- 8/5 I love these vendors, I love this product, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wanted some good, solid celebration coke (remember those dopamine levels, boys and girls :P)<br /><br />~&lt;3 Ali

				Here&#039;s my review of CaptainSnowFlakes, who&#039;s new here.&nbsp; Brilliant stuff if you don&#039;t feel like reading it all:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Alighier</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Oh Captain, my Captain!<br /><br />All right, here we go-<br /><br />Stealth 5/5-&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen stealth like it before.&nbsp; I was a bit disappointed to begin with, but after talking with the vendor, agreed that it was spot-on.<br /><br />Shipping- 5/5 On time, always a plus ;)<br /><br />Weight- 6/5 a bit above the .25 sample, OH YES!<br /><br />Quality- 10/5&nbsp; Here&#039;s where it gets fun-&nbsp; I had lost hope in IV cocaine, even the supposedly &quot;top-notch&quot; vendors on the road, not to mention street quality, had always been so disappointing.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think cocaine was worth all the hype IV.&nbsp; The Cap promised me goods, and I received.<br /><br />Passed all tests- between the fingers, cook test, 25mg sniff test and taste test.&nbsp; Now it was time to prepare a shot.&nbsp; 50ml of water and 75mg of the Captain&#039;s coke- dissolved with no heat (a must for coke) and... here we go!<br /><br />The rush was slow to set, which is indicative of something good to come and then then BAM!&nbsp; It was as if I were hit by a train, the bells ringing away like a church, my body filling with tingles and my mind filling with the all the euphoria of my best coke experiences slam packed into 15 seconds.&nbsp; Before doing a single shot, I decided I was going to save the rest for later.&nbsp; No such luck, though the desire to redose was far less than anything else I&#039;ve ever shot.&nbsp; I shot another 100mg with just as brilliant an effect.&nbsp; The last 50mg shot was lackluster, which is to be expected, but still got me in the right mood.&nbsp; Coming down now with no jitters and could definitely sleep.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t seem to be an active cut and unlike another vendor I&#039;d ventured this with, no strange marks at injection site.<br /><br />All in all, CaptainSnowFlakes has restored my faith in coke via this route.&nbsp; And for that, I can&#039;t thank them enough!<br /><br />Much, much love!<br />~Ali<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
