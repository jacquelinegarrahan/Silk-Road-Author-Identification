				I bought some wares from UNCLESAMSSTASH which failed a marquis test horribly. <br /><br />See for yourself: <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=146775.0<br /><br /><br />Anyways since I&#039;ve called him out on it and left less then 5 feedback he&#039;s &quot;blacklisted&quot; me. Will that have any negative effect on future transactions with other, more honest vendors?

				No it means that he is a sad cunt vendor with no morals... and hes not AT ALL big enough to have any sway or power over any other vendors,&nbsp; just go to them for a for better service. I personally only got with the top 5% ranked vendors, they will never let you down. These kind of new vendor scamming schmucks make SR look bad.<br /><br />If I were you i&#039;d change your score to 1/5 for trying to blackmail you and tell him to stick the black list up his arse with all his shit gear. <br /><br />Stay away from that clown.<br /><br />

				The &#039;blacklist&#039; is more myth than reality. A vendor has to have a lot of credibility before other vendors will take his complaint against a buyer seriously.
