				&nbsp;8)I wanted to vend some myself, I have a small supply every month of what appear to be pretty popular items: 30 - 10mg hydorcodone; 30 - 600mg neurotin, 30 to 90 - 10mg cyclobenzaprine, 30+ - 10mg baclofen, 30 - 60mg Cymbalta, 30 + - 4 mg. zanaflex (tizanidine - good for sleeping after speeding, no drug hangover), and 1,215 mg. of Androgel Tetosterone Gel 1.62% (could be a 30 day supply for up to 4 men, but comes in one bottle and gel is hard to divide up into doses). My dependability is that I have already been getting these EXTRA every month (e.g.&nbsp; I get 4 - 10mg. Hydros per day - only need 2-3max)&nbsp; for over 5 years, and if anything I would only get more or switch on up to oxy. I feel a hell of a lot better when I can get just a few tokes a day of some med quality smoke! I don&#039;t really want to get into getting more supply, but would like to sell/trade/barter what I&#039;ve got. Problem is the $500 they want me to put up to be a vendor. I&#039;m on a pretty much fixed income,&nbsp; I&#039;m helping my daughter raise 2 of my grand-kids, and that is a fairly large chunk of pure cash to me right now. I wish they would let me start vending and just keep all the proceeds till I&#039;ve got the $500 in there, but DPR is so sidetracked right now I&#039;m not about to ask him (unless someone with some experience says it would be okay to ask). So, would someone be interested in helping me get started (or I&#039;d work a wholesale price deal with someone that would just keep going ). I&#039;m thinking that ought to retail about $600, 8) 8) before SR fees, mailing &amp; stealth packing cost etc.. I&#039;d be willing to split that with someone that could help me out, or sell them the whole thing for @$285, or the going price of a good Oz. of prime weed. Any thoughts or help on my situation? I&#039;ll sure appreciate any help or ideas you can give me! And I already know that the Atlantis joint only wants $25 to start, which of course is do-able, but it doesn&#039;t feel right to me yet. I like the whole deal here with SR, and hope it can get back going, and I along with it! Thanks, Pappy<br />

				Have you been able to find that &quot;middle man&quot; you&#039;ve been looking for?&nbsp; I too am looking to sell on SR but I don&#039;t have the supply and I have no idea how to get it.&nbsp; I have the capital but it doesn&#039;t do much good if I don&#039;t have anything to sell.&nbsp; So how can we make this work together?&nbsp; Let me know if you&#039;re interested.
