				Nobody can answer that only you have control over it. Different substance effect different people completely different. Some people cant even drink a beer without losing it.

				yeah, some people can do it, some people can&#039;t. you won&#039;t know until you try it. it&#039;s a game of russian roulette. meth is just all around bad news, it&#039;s by far the most toxic of all common drugs and the after effects can last for weeks. everytime i&#039;ve tried it i never really felt normal again for a month, and no way is the high worth that kind of comedown.

				my statement is do it if the reward is worth the risk and as a meth user i&#039;d honestly say stick to acid&#039;s, MDMA or pills.<br />Meth can be your best friend and it can be your worst enemy its not worth it mate trust me but do as you wish thats the only way you will ever know.<br /><br />Enjoy

				Done it once.... holy shit that rush, I felt like fucking superman. On the other hand that crash was the most horrible thing I&#039;ve ever felt, 10 fold that of a heavy night of E. I dont regret trying it but not my thing.

				The truth from a meth head&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a high tolerance to just about any drug as well as meth but not many people do and can handle it .&nbsp; They think they are fine and handling it but you just have to look at them to see otherwise .It seems to be the younger you are the worse it is.&nbsp; &nbsp; If your here asking this question then i would say stay away from it.

I don&#039;t get comedowns from speed (but many people do), and the last time i took meth it only took me a week to get back into some sort of routine. Nevertheless, my preference these days is Ecstasy for parties cos it&#039;s easier and friendlier and less likely to end up complicated.<br /><br />Amphetamine dependancy is more an insatiable and potentially destructive habit, rather than a physical craving of the body. (Adddiction generally requires time, money and a certain amount of committment.)

				I have never personally done meth but I&#039;ve been around a lot of people who have. I agree with evetSFree - if you have to ask this question, it&#039;s probably a bad idea.<br /><br />SR gives you access to plenty of fascinating chemicals with a much better track record in the ruining lives department.
