				Shit that was a worry....i was completely fucked on the heroin at that stage<br /><br />What i was trying to say was that im been up for about 4 days on crack and meth...and thought it was timed to slow down so i started taking heroin yesterday which smacked me in the head and i could hardly move.<br /><br />Now not that experienced with heroin and i was doing it on my own by was freaking if i was falling asleep i was overdosing cause i was nodding so much hardly get that message out....<br /><br />i was wondering should i take some meth at this stage to keep me awake/not oding?<br /><br />pretty much just gave up after that message and passed out or slept....whatever....but the main thing is i woke up again - i threw up this morning....i think that was cause of the heroin...the meth has me feeling ok today

				Maybe you should slow down a tad bit... Especially with the heroin. Meth isn&#039;t really going to pull you out of a heroin overdose, only Narcan can really help, or similar antagonists. It&#039;s what emergency response teams use to pull people out of a typical overdose.<br /><br />Stay safe.
