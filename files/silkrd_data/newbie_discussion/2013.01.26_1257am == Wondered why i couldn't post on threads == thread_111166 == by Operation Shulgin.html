				This 50 post count requirement is a bit excessive. I&#039;ve been on this forum since at least July of last year and now I can&#039;t post.

				This 50 posts before you may actually post is not cool. Some members might be big in business but not so eager to post on forums all day. I would wanna read what those guys had to say about shit. 5o spams counts for nothing in my opinion.

				So spend a couple days posting in the newbie forum and you&#039;re in for life.&nbsp; The reason they did it was because of newbie spam and idiots I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good way to weed out the assholes that don&#039;t want to take the time to join the club.
