				Please reply to boost those numbers!!<br /><br />Before relocating to another part of the country, I had a couple of excellent connects. Granted, they were close friends, so were probably on their better behavior. And I was willing to overlook uncomfortable situations, like illegal firearms sitting in plain view, without batting an eyelash. But bad dealers can make you question your most basic goals in life (which, of course, involve smoking weed every day). The first 10 reasons why I prefer hitting the road over the street that come to mind are:<br />

				1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know when it’s coming. Ok, you might not necessarily know the exact day on which it will arrive, but it’s comforting to know that, if it is coming, it will arrive when the mail is delivered. If it does not arrive with the mail, at least you know it won’t be that day. Some weed dealers can set a window of time that will kill an entire weekend and make the cable guy look like johnny-on-the-spot.

				Because you can check it out before you buy some and not feel like a dick if you decline, because they won&#039;t even know you did :P And even if they did it&#039;s not like you have to actually tell them you don&#039;t want it, just click on the next listing.<br /><br />Plus you can check out a bunch of other reviews of what other people are saying about it

				When I buy off SR I feel like I&#039;m buying from a professional who usually knows their shit about weed. Going to college in small town midwest, when I buy off a street dealer he usually can&#039;t even tell me what strain the bud is or where it was grown. SR has completely changed the quality of my smoke, hopefully soon I&#039;ll be able to spread it around and let my friends enjoy too.

				Would have thought that most people selling on the road aren&#039;t your average street dealers. They value their privacy as well as yours. Safer than walking out to meet someone then carrying shit around.<br />But there&#039;s always the change the postie will get hold of it before you do...<br />From friends experience its much better quality though, as you&#039;d expect

				Sounds like you guys live in shitty places. Awesome AAA with bargain bulk prices are abundant where I&#039;m form. Honestly, the weed prices on SR are way overpriced (especially for bulk). Basically SR is great for all your substance needs, aside for weed (unless you live in a Muslim country or East Asia, I really don&#039;t see why you would choose SR over street) and RC&#039;s. You can obtain quality RC&#039;s of&nbsp; all assortments on the clearnet that provides gc/mc and usually are lab grade with 99% purity. You just gotta do more research into it and look harder (believe me, you can even get hooked up with the rarest, novelty RC&#039;s over the clearnet).

				personally i like shopping around for that certain bud i want, instead of just getting whatever the guy down the street has in stock. although i have smoked some hella dank where i am from. i don&#039;t really like how my buds get flattened when i order from sr, i love my buds fluffy. so i guess it just depends on where your at and what your looking for.... just stating the obvious

				My initial idea behind the SR being better is that I have access to strains I&#039;ve never had.<br />I will have to wait and see about the actual quality of the product when I receive it. <br />Getting it and having it flat/compacted isnt something im looking forward to<br /><br />My area has had good selection in the past but right now, the problem with all drugs in my area, is quality.<br />

				I been all over the game and areas and unless you have a good connect your not getting the vast majority of this quality of smoke I see listed on SR for those prices if that&#039;s so I wanna live where you live.&nbsp; For good as dank in my area unless your know somebody your paying any where&#039;s from 350-450 a oz and if your lucky maybe 300-350 if ya know somebody and it&#039;s still not as dank cause people&#039;s word are shit anymore....lol.&nbsp; As far as legalization of medical marijuana goes there will always still be money to made in the street because there really strict on who and can not buy, pretty sure the police prolly pulls there entrapment shit on people leaving those types of venues and the prices are pretty damn high.&nbsp; And when and if they do legalize marijuana completely it will be awhile yet before you go into your local deli and ask for a pack of some haze bubble wrapped flavor joints. As they will be figuring out how to sell it for how much how much tax what licenses do ya need how strong should they make it how old do you have to be and etc..... Besides getting it through the mail which I think is really only part scary about ordering it cause all it takes is one fuck up from a vendor not to package it right and have the wrong want a promotion employee to get suspect on us were fucked, unless you follow all the advice that these veterans on SR have been so kindly to give us, besides that SR is the shit and Im damn proud to be one of the few to know about it now...

Thats what im talking about, but SR is the shit, there are tons of quality dealers but yes, the shipping in the mail method means a paranoia filled few days!

				Because I don&#039;t have to move to a district where marijuana is tolerated to enjoy high quality medicinal marijuana?<br /><br />I&#039;d say that&#039;s the most obvious. <br /><br /><br />Plausible deniability I&#039;d say comes in at a close second.

				Because you can read reviews before buying and know what you&#039;re buying is fucking stanky dank. On the street any &quot;hustla&quot; can sling some schwag or mids as high grades giving the illusion of exclusivity, because who&#039;s going to question them? Who&#039;s going to call them out on it even more than that? On SR a vendor&#039;s long term livelihood depends on building good customer base and good reviews so they&#039;re incentivized to give us the best of the best.
