				I think it&#039;s raising the quality and lowering the price for the US on average, but with such a sudden market will need a few years to balance out and for the right consumer to find the right producer.

				I wonder whether this means we&#039;ll eventually see weed vendors growing in colorado who can make more by being a cheap SR vendor, than by selling locally... that would be a win-win situation.<br /><br />Although I guess customs are probably more suspicious now of packages originating there...

				I doubt the flooded market and lower prices will cause quality will drop much. The MMJ market in CO has been around for years, so there is already a good establishment of high quality professional growers in the state. The streets are already loaded with dispensary quality bud that I can&#039;t see amateurs growing in their backyard competing with the quality of the pro&#039;s.<br />

				Personally, I think the stuff sold in California, and colorado can not compare to the stuff grown illegally. My only evidence of this is when dealers say &quot;this that cali shit man&quot; its almost always just good weed not the best. So I just told myself all of these guys were liars. Then I met a guy at work that was from the Bay area, and he sold weed down in New Orleans, I hung out with him alot, and I saw his medicinal marijuana card. He told me his friends still sent him OZs from Cali. One day I was smoking with him when one of his packages came, I watched him open it. I saw the packging, the stuff really came from Cali. And still I have smoked much higher quality. The stickiest smelliest stuff seems to come from people growing totally illegally. Just my opinion.

My only evidence of this is when dealers say &quot;this that cali shit man&quot; its almost always just good weed not the best. So I just told myself all of these guys were liars. Then I met a guy at work that was from the Bay area, and he sold weed down in New Orleans, I hung out with him alot, and I saw his medicinal marijuana card. He told me his friends still sent him OZs from Cali. One day I was smoking with him when one of his packages came, I watched him open it. I saw the packging, the stuff really came from Cali. And still I have smoked much higher quality. The stickiest smelliest stuff seems to come from people growing totally illegally. Just my opinion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree 100%. In Mi, before medical marijuana, the best weed was SOOO fucking good because it took a bomb ass grower to be able to command $400 an oz when the regs were $100 an oz. Now, you cant find that bomb shit anymore but you can find some meadiocre shit for like 300 a zone<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I will back this statement %100
