				Hi there!<br /><br />I took about 20 Valium (10mg) in the course of the day the other day. Smoked some weed and everything was nice and I felt very good. I know (now) that was too much Valium. <br /><br />The next day I drank about 1 1/2 liters of wine, smoked weed and took three Valiums that I had left. This was a very, very&nbsp; stupid thing to do. I know (now).<br />Then I have memory loss what exactly happened next. I woke up in the middle of the night and one of my eyes was so swollen that I could not open it anymore. My bed, shirt and floor was full of blood and my nose was bleeding. I went to emergency and had to stay in hospital for five days because my maxillary sinus had multifragmentary fractures.<br />My face and nose has recovered mostly. In the worst case it will stay a bit unsymmetrical. But the most frightening thing is that I still have very much problems with cognitive demands. Mostly with memory.<br /><br />When I came home from hospital I flushed any drugs I had left down the toilet. So I did not touch any drugs or alcohol since then. The whole mess I made is one week ago but I still have great problems with remembering things. E.g. I had to change my passwords nearly every day because I could not remember them anymore. And I still have amnesic aphasia and other cognitive problems. I even could not understand the timetable for subway and took the wrong direction once. I am in neurological care with making a MRT of my brain but I have to wait two weeks for that appointment.<br /><br />It would be nice to know what exactly happened. But that is not that important to me right now.<br />My question is if my brain will stay a vegetable for the rest of my life or are my cognitive problems still the aftereffects of the Valium overdose and if I will recover in some time. The doctors told me to relax and not to worry to much. They told me that I probably did not had a brain concussion. But the whole thing really scares me. <br /><br />As I am a software engineer my brain is quite important for me.<br />Any info or advise would be greatly appreciated.<br />Thank you.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />The stupid drug guy<br />
