				So, I ordered #4 Heroin from a certain vendor.&nbsp; I have never been scammed on SR before, and I don&#039;t know exactly what to do.&nbsp; I paid almost $180 for 10 bags of #4, and what I received was what looked like brown sand and had a very odd smell.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using dope (unfortunately) for a while, and this isn&#039;t dope.. Anyhow, I will paste the message I sent him and any advice would be great!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here more then a year, and hardly ever use the forums... but I guess this is a good reason to.&nbsp; Thanks again! :)<br /><br />&quot;Hey,<br />Disregard all previous messages. The truck was late for some reason. However, the shipping isn&#039;t the issue. Im not going to be a dick like some people or accuse you of anything, but this is not right.<br /><br />I opened the package, and pulled the bags out. I dont know any other way to say this, but...what is this you sent me? I have been using IV Heroin for 10+ years, and this stuff is not dope. I used three different rigs to try and pull up this stuff that I mixed with water (by the way, had to use A LOT for it to even be able to be halfway sucked up). The product did not dissolve hardly at all regardless of how much water I used. If this is #4 Heroin, it shouldn&#039;t be brownish water with what looks like sand sitting on the bottom of the cap.<br /><br />Ive used BTH, #3, and #4, and I have never seen this before. I tried sniffing a bag, and it BURNED like holy hell. That&#039;s something else I&#039;ve never encountered. If this was just bunk dope that didn&#039;t get me high, I would release the funds and just say fuck it, I didn&#039;t like it. But this is not dope. I feel like this was just a scam, which I hope it&#039;s not and you can make this right.<br /><br />Thanks&quot;<br /><br />

				Realease the vendors name in the OP. People need to see what vendors have shitty quality. It isn&#039;t private info, and the vendor won&#039;t be able to see who you are.

				He&#039;s reading my messages, but not replying... So I am going to take a guess and say he&#039;s not going to fix this problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am just glad it wasn&#039;t a huge order, but if I lose $200 that&#039;s still going to fucking suck.

You should ask for 100% reship or 100% refund if you got 100% bunk. Many people in your shoes have gotten 100% (depending on past history, etc) from resolution but hopefully the vendor will do the right thing and you won&#039;t have to go to resolution. As mentioned it could have been a mistake when trying to implement new stealth or other process.
