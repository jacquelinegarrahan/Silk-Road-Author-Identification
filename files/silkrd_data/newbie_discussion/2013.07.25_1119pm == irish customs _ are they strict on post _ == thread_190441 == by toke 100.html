Within EU you just dont need a customs declaration for tax/duty. That doesn&#039;t effect this thing here.

				Southern Ireland or Northern Ireland.<br /><br />If the former then yes they are stricter and slower for sure. If the latter no problem IMO/IME.<br /><br />I recently posted someone some green to a Belfast address which is then picked up and transported to a Dublin Mail Box they then send a PIN by Text and you go collect your parcel. The reason for Belfast route is it&#039;s much faster that passing through Eire Post/Customs 2 days rather than 5-8 days. I don&#039;t remember the name of the service but if interested PM and I&#039;ll ask my friend.<br /><br />Edit: EU to EU Customs most definitely exist but it would seem they concentrate on hotter regions but seizures do happen.

				ugh, just got a letter from Irish customs. 3G of weed from holland. packaging wasn&#039;t the most professional looking tbh, but i think they might be cracking down, i&#039;;ve noticed packages taking an extra day or two to arrive from the EU than previous. can take over a week now when it used to reliably arrive within 4 days.

				yeah there are practically no irish vendours - jerseycow sells large amounts, and nobody sells mdma, just pills. ordered from uk recently and it has been a long time so think it got seized/lost, wondering if i should expect a letter or not if it was seized on uk side. have had stuff from PL mostly

				Only one vendor..Really! .<br />I just moved here from Atlantis a month ago and while I cant speak for the site I remember there being at least two Irish vendors there offering free samples at one point when they were starting out. <br />I was annoyed as they were looking for domestic clients and didn&#039;t want to try sending through Scandinavian customs to me. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;m allowed link to Atlantis vendors on here but I believe &quot;superhands&quot; was the name of one.

				Caman is a good Irish Cannabis vendor, I got some of his emerald jack a few months back, great smoke and next day delivery. He&#039;s just back from a long break too. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5d57e787c1<br /><br />Other Irish vendors out there are SweetGreenDreams, MaidMandy, TheJollyRoger, Swanney, zapco.. Probably forgetting a few but seems they&#039;ve got most drugs popular drugs covered, just more expensive than international vendors. That&#039;s the cost of the convenience.<br />
