				Hey guys. So I just bought my first BTCs from localbitcoin. <br /><br />I have been using tor browser every time to access localbitcoin but when I met the seller to exchange cash (everything went perfectly btw, transfer was immediate) I only had my phone so I had to log on to localbitcoin from my phone to confirm the transfer.<br /><br />When I send my BTCs to my SR account, could this be somehow traced back to me due to the fact that I used my phone to access my localbitcoin account 2 times?<br /><br />My newbieness is definitely making me paranoid.. Should I be worried here? Have people accessed localbitcoin from their phones (or other unsecure places)?

				Unless your planning to buy ridiculously stupid amounts I wouldn&#039;t worry about Law Enforcement.<br /><br />I doubt they could trace it back to you and to be honest they only would if you were a big time dealer. I know people on this site who use there personal name, address, bank card and any other possible personal details you could think of.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry you are being paranoid, but sometimes that is the best it keeps you on your toe and for future I have a old phone with a throw away sim card I change every so often, pre paid debit cards and a postal drop box in a fake name. So don&#039;t worry your not the only paranoid one ;) but honestly you don&#039;t need to be

				With what the NSA is doing the data has definitely been logged. There was an article that came out a couple days ago that was talking about how any communications that used tor, pgp, etc. were to be logged regardless if the participants were either in the US or it was indeterminable where the participants were located. You have to assume that all everything is being logged. For now you really have nothing to worry about with local police or the DEA tracking your info and trying to bust you for buying something off the road. However with how easy it is becoming to store large amounts of data longterm the big thing I would worry about would be when they change laws regarding what they can do with the data they mine, or when they start going after political dissidents.

				The basic rule is if youre a newb and trying to buy. Just keep it to normal quantities and you&#039;ll be fine&nbsp; When you start buying pounds of anything recheck everything youre doing but until then if you have any common sense your in the clear.

				Doesn&#039;t matter whether the care at this point. It&#039;s still good to be informed that they are absolutely holding on to everything they sniff and they might use it in the future 5-10 years from now.

				Just be careful that information will never be deleted. On the other hand its not illegal to buy BTC and if you get to buying a lot of BTC over time just start up another wallet somewhere else or a new account with same site if you like them. This was suggested to me from a long time SR user that I know personally that got me on to the site.

				Bitcoins can be traced around the bitcoin network too, so motivated LE could go to bitcoinlocal with a warrant and say &quot;we know this bitcoin address went to the silk road / busted dealer X*, give us all info about it&quot;, they could hand over your IP address. Won&#039;t happen with small amounts, as others said, so don&#039;t worry excessively, but it isn&#039;t best practise. Install the tor android browser (I forget the name; find it on https://torproject.org) for the future.

				I am pretty confident about bitcoin, yet I do keep up with current events to make sure there are no developments.

				Yes it can be linked - however as already stated it is unlikely that anyone would bother and would require access to the Localbitcoins.com server logs. The actual transaction/check would have been performed over HTTPS so even somebody sniffing the wire would not be able to associate your access from&nbsp; the phone with a particular account or wallet address.<br /><br />Your best bet is to transfer from localbitcoins to another online wallet or better still a local wallet installed on a laptop/desktop. Better still ensure that the local wallet machine connects to the Bitcoin p2p network via TOR (there are various guides on this - basically it is a one line change to the bitcoin.conf file to add a SOCKS proxy).<br /><br />Anyway, one you have transferred to a local wallet you can then pass on to SR or perhaps another wallet first.<br /><br />Localbitcoins &gt; Local wallet(via TOR) &gt; Another wallet(s) - local or online &gt; SR<br /><br />The above adds a layer of obfuscation as well as enhancing deniability. Ideally only use an online wallet once, burn it afterwards (use a username and password that you do not use anywhere else).
