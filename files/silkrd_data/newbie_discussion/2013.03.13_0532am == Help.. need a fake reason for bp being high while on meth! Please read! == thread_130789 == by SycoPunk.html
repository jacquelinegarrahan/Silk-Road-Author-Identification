				If you don&#039;t want to read everything here&#039;s the short version:<br /><br />I&#039;m admitted into hospital 2 weeks now. snorted some meth. 2 hours after dosing which is like an hour and a half from now my BP and temp will be checked and both will be high becuase of meth. Can i explain away a sudden increase in BP / temp with a fake reason about how I&#039;ve been extremely anxious over something? if not whats the best fake reason to give?<br /><br />Full story:<br /><br /><br />Ok! So i am in the hospital. been here for 2 weeks. Had abscess drained and I&#039;m okay physically and only reason i am not out yet is just time for incision to heal a bit more.<br /><br />SR meth order arrived in mail and someone has been bringing me my mail every few days! have been fucking bored out of my mind stuck here so when i opened my mail and saw my meth i figured.. what the hell.. why not... (I know stupid when I&#039;m in hospital.) I insufflated about 10mg 2 - 3 hours ago and another 20-30mg about a half hour ago. So here&#039;s where i need advice:<br /><br />I then realized... &quot;Oh shit they check my blood pressure every 4 hours&quot; and my BP is definitely high. How can i explain having a raised BP all of a sudden and for so long once they start constantly checking me because I&#039;m sure they will once they see its high (also body temp is up too). I have been staying up late here in general anyway so explaining being awake wouldn&#039;t be an issue. I was thinking since i told them i sometimes have anxiety and they also started me on antidepressant a week and a half ago if i could tell them I&#039;ve been feeling really anxious.. I&#039;m usually not away from my belongings for so long and usually do get anxious when i cant see that my belongings are safe / with me so would a lot of anxiety about worrying about my stuff (among other things) be a good fake reason to give that would explain a high BP and body temp? I do not want to tell them i took meth. Or if not what would be a good thing to say I&#039;ve been doing / feeling that could explain it? exercising? lots of coffee?<br /><br />I also have access to 10mg oxycodone every 5 or 6 hours for pain from the procedure (i don&#039;t have any pain anymore though but been taking advantage of my access to them) Just took a 10mg dose about a half hour ago as well.<br /><br />Any advice would be appreciated. Also.. FYI... I&#039;m only being observed physically when BP is checked so i can stop myself from physically looking tweaked for the few minutes they check vitals as well so i think the only thing they will notice related to my high is the high BP and body temperature.<br /><br />One last short question. Is there any way i can lower my BP and/or body temp by drinking a lot of water or eating food just so it lowered even just a little? Or will relaxing / laying down / anything else 10 minutes before nurse comes in help at all?<br /><br />Thank you to anyone with input!

				Pretending to sleep will not work as they will just check it anyway and wake me if they need to.

				I&#039;m not worried too much about getting caught high since they cant tell the cops anyway. I&#039;m definitely not running id rather tell them. I&#039;d just rather not have to tell them and have a good explanation for my vitals.

				Don&#039;t mention it and if they say anything just say &quot;oh i&#039;m just feeling a little anxious, being in here away from my things for so long.&quot; <br />That really should satisfy them.<br />If not, just shug and stick with it...no worries. You&#039;re psyching yourself up-making it worse. Chill. It&#039;s all good man.

				they said it a lil high but i was walking around and they said oh it prolly cuz u just got up... so i figured they would wait the 5 hours till checking me again so i took another 20 - 30 mg line but then they came in like 10 mins after that to check it again and it was 170/103.. Talked to them again and they were like yeah its high but your bp has been going up and down anyway.. so i dont know what theyre gonna do now.. that last test was like 5 mins ago.<br />Modify message<br />
