				Hi Peaceful<br /><br />It&#039;s great you can lay your own tabs. Do you have any idea on the crystal purity, origins etc. Have you trip tested your own product...OEV, CEV head space etc? Any further descriptions would be appreciated and I would love to sample your product. It is a shame that you will have to hike the price up afterwards. Aussies have to pay way too much for acid. At $20 a tab multiplied by 3 tabs per session = $60.&nbsp; EU equivalent or US/Canadian equivalent = $30 to $40 per session. If you have a way of keeping fairer prices and if your product is as good as you claim, you will have the domestic market at your heels.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Dimmu

				Hi,<br /><br />Obviously without giving a full synth guide, here&#039;s as much as you need to know:<br /><br />We produce the LSD from ergot.&nbsp; The ergot is grown by us in an extremely controlled environment and carefully seperated from any additional fungi.&nbsp; &nbsp;A few more refinements to get it into a substance we can extract LSD from and walah.&nbsp; <br /><br />This batch is tested at 91.4% purity.&nbsp; Our next batch will be even higher.<br /><br />Of course I have tested my own product, I would never send anyone anything I hadn&#039;t eaten myself yet.&nbsp; I had three tabs the other night.&nbsp; I went to the beach and had a lot of OEV&#039;s, the sky was changing from dark green to deep blue to deep orange slowly and beautifully.&nbsp; After sunrise there were 3 seagulls on the beach, I let myself relax and sit back and the seagulls turned into about 20 of them, each of them slowly disappearing into the sand like they were burrowing. There also appeared to be little rectangular rainbow looking shapes in between everything I was looking at, small but beautiful.&nbsp; I had some great self insights and when I closed my eyes I felt very seperated from the world in the most peaceful way with great OEV&#039;s (mostly random geometric shapes and colors.&nbsp; I had a xanax to get to sleep (I always follow my trips with benzos) and woke up feeling fantastic and had a really productive week.<br /><br />Hope that helps

				Hi Guys,<br /><br />I got a private message from someone about our made LSD:<br /><br />&quot;Guys...............150ug really? That was the MOST amazing acid i have ever had hands down game over!!!!!<br /><br />I really apologise because for whatever reasons i don&#039;t want to make a forum account so i hope you can post this review in the forums on my behalf.<br /><br />Let me start by giving some background to my experiences. I have tried just about every psychedelic RC out there. I am also fairly experienced with LSD over the last 5yrs. I have tried many vendors here on silk road local and international. All types of dosing claims ie.. 300ug, 250ug, 150ug hits etc.. So put straight, i aint no noob.<br /><br />Unfortunately there isn&#039;t something more than caps lock to express this....THIS IS THE FUCKING REAL DEAL ELL ESS DEE MY FRIENDS. The MOST amazingly beautiful, clearheaded, incredibly deep and intense trip off of just one blotter. Me being the guts almost took 1 1/2 thinking 150ug would only leave me wanting more. Holy fuck how wrong was I. However given the utter beauty and lack of severe body load i feel i could do more. This trip at times felt so far deeper than some of my largest trips (3 x 250ug hits Matrix blotters. Was great acid, shame about the vendor). I was just able to go astoundingly deep and then come back to reality with reasonable ease. There was a real defined peak in ways i have not experienced with other acid also. It was so deep for about 4-5hrs then transitioned into come down very quickly. The peak was so high compared to the comedown that it really made for a strange experience compared to others. During the trip, it was so deep that I was constantly thinking, Oh fuck i&#039;ve bought some fucking crazy cunts homemade blotter and he&#039;s laid it with some untold ug and i&#039;m gunna be tripping for 24hrs, goddam i have to work tomorrow! I had a beautiful sleep. Dropped about 8pm was head on pillow by 2am awoke 10am. Given the intensity of the trip i can&#039;t believe it was that short. Now some may be thinking by the sounds of that, that this aint acid. Let me tell you i know what acid looks and feels like and this is LSD.<br /><br />I know i still have 9 left burning a hole through my cupboard. But goddam i just want to get some more.<br /><br />So clean. So clear. So beautiful. Best LSD EVER!!!!!!! totally changed my expectations of LSD. Body load was so minimal. Euphoria was very prevalent. I did have a little issue with vaso-constriction towards the end of the trip. I think this may be related closer to my health situation rather than the product, as i&#039;ve experienced a similar thing with shrooms of late.<br /><br />This seriously takes the cake. You guys have really excelled and i feel so grateful to have had the chance to try this stuff. I&#039;m going to really treasure my future experiences with this amazing blotter. Thankyou sooooo much. Whilst i&#039;m annoyed at prices of LSD in the domestic australian market, I would pay $20 a hit for this no worries.<br /><br /><br />Also interesting random side note....Whilst i was tripping i figured out another local vendor GoldTops is trying to pull the same scam as EnterTheMatrix earlier in the year. Big clear out sale. Lots of FE. He&#039;s made an excuse about LE so when packages don&#039;t arrive thats his defense. DODGY!!! Hopefully i can get the little bit of coin back off him to invest in Peaceful. Infact i can&#039;t see myself ever needing another vendor, this is the best shit hands down. Why try anything else!!!!!!!!<br /><br />-&nbsp; ***********&quot;<br /><br />If you think I am making this up, or fabricated this review, please contact SR support and ask if I received this PM.&nbsp; I give them permission to check :-)<br /><br />Not sure why he didn&#039;t want to make a forum account, but yes folks, BEAUTIFUL LSD :-)<br /><br />

				This was my first SR purchase and I was extremely happy with it. Peaceful was fast and friendly in their communication and shipped promptly.<br /><br />Now on to the product:<br /><br />I was with a large group of friends taking LSD.<br /><br />Myself and two friends had used LSD more than 8 times previously (I have used it more than 15) and the three of us started with one of these tabs each at around 10:30 am. The other friends took slightly weaker tabs.<br /><br />Each tab was large and the three of us felt the effects much sooner than the others and with greater intensity.<br /><br />It started with the usual body fuzziness after around 25 minutes which was pleasant and exciting. Soon my mind had slowed down and I was thinking about things with intensity, seeing metaphors and discussing extremely abstract concepts.<br /><br />This stuff is strong! Colours and patterns everywhere, people laughing so hard they were often in tears (in a good way). There were so many of us it was a very social and party-like atmosphere so we didn&#039;t have the opportunity to really plumb the depths of our consciousness but I have no doubt we could have with this product.<br /><br />Midway through the trip we had a cap or less of mushrooms, which served to enhance the visuals for a couple of hours of the trip - which I would definitely recommend if you have a good handle on yourself.<br /><br />There were interesting moments of introspection and self-analysis and enjoyment of nature and our surroundings.<br /><br />In addition to two of these, I also took one of the weaker tabs and 3/4 of a mushroom cap + liberal servings of weed and alcohol [it was a big day]. I slept (though not very well) at approximately 3-4am. I took a 150mg 5-HTP tablet in the morning, not sure if it did anything but I was functioning well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product. If you haven&#039;t taken much LSD before, probably start with just a half, especially if you weigh less than 60kgs.<br /><br />During most trips I usually start with two tabs and will take more later - I wouldn&#039;t do that with these unless I wanted to get super super high, they are that good.<br /><br />I always trip in the daytime so next time will probably do 1.5 of these to start, then a half or maybe one more after three or four hours.

				Ok, these blotters are fucking potent - a single tab was comparable to some (supposed) 300ug trips that I&#039;ve had in the past. (Either all of my previous tabs were weak as piss with over-embellished dosages, or you packed these ones here with a little extra oomph!) Compared to past trips, if I had to guess the dosage of this recent tab, then I&#039;d say 240.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only tried 300, 150 and 75 doses. The two former doses have always resulted in wonderful trips, whereas I suffered a random 10-second panic attack during the the 75ug trip. Strangely enough, I think my body came to associate that brief moment with the slight metallic taste that you get with some blotters, because since then, it has always taken a small amount of effort for me to actually get the blotter into my mouth! (Fucking weird?) =P<br /><br />Now as for these blotters, I don&#039;t think they had any taste to them... but I wouldn&#039;t know for sure, because I was a complete pussy and I wedged it between two starbursts and swallowed it, lmao!)<br /><br />---<br /><br />As for the actual trip:<br /><br />11:40AM - I ingested the tab; noticed first effects at 35-40 minutes; I almost always experience mild nausea during the come up, but this time there was little-to-no nausea, and I instead experienced extreme arousal. I had to wonder if it were laced with something else (You didn&#039;t store these in the viagra cabinet did you?) because I was that fucking horny! I&#039;ve never experiencing that during a trip before, haha.<br /><br />1:10PM - Had reached the peak by this time, which lasted a good 5 or so hours; plenty of OEVs, and lots of colorful, shimmering 3D CEVs. (I dunno about others, but during a strong trip I always see vivid, elliptical, predator-like eyes constantly flashing all over the place (both OEV and CEV) throughout the peak, and this time was no exception! At some point I remember questioning why I always see so many eyes during trips, and then I looked down and I was wearing this. http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=c11e327<br /><br />About half way I felt like listening to some music, but my computer screen decided to fuck up and I was tripping too hard to fix it. &quot;Come on, I could fix this shit in 10 seconds flat if I were clean.&quot; - So I fucked around rearranging cables (in 15 second attention bursts every 5-10 minutes) for 2 hours, before finding the common sense to try removing and reinserting the power cord... 10 seconds flat! XD<br /><br />c. 6:00PM - I&#039;m usually pretty good on the come down and most times find it quite pleasant, slowly easing back into reality - but this trip had a much more harsh, defined come down for me (nothing too bad, just much more noticeable). Perhaps I was enjoying it so much that I didn&#039;t want to reconnect with myself, who knows. (This was the first trip where I actually experienced periodic ego disconnection, delving in to the Superego and touching upon the Id). For that reason alone, I&#039;d say this was definitely the best trip that I&#039;ve had to date. Very insightful experience.<br /><br />Occasionally, during the latter half of a trip I might decide to attempt a quick painting. I find that it helps in the midst of a less-than-pleasant come down, plus whatever crap I draw is usually a direct reflection of how my brain is feeling at that time. (Most of the time the pictures turn out morbid or fucked up in some way, reflecting the feeling of my brain constantly being &quot;slammed&quot; with information). Anyway, here&#039;s this trip&#039;s painting - a dead furry: http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/image.php?id=63f59c8<br /><br />c. 3:30AM - I managed to fall asleep by this time (the come down is incredibly gradual with me and the effects often last well into the night before it finally settles).<br /><br />---<br /><br />Fucking awesome trip, and I&#039;m looking forward to the next one. I think I&#039;ll try two next time, and I fully expect that it will blow any previous 300ug trips right out of the water.<br /><br />The only downside is that - after trying one of these tabs - it will definitely raise your bar of expectations in regards to what LSD can offer. (In other words, I&#039;m betting that 95% of other acid that I may or may not try in the future, simply won&#039;t weigh up compared to this stuff).<br /><br />Excellent! - and my advice to anyone new is, either go with a 150ug or a 300ug dose - depending on how much you know or trust yourself. (Anything less than 300 and you may be left unwilling to go any further but always wondering. If you&#039;re an introvert, then trip alone in a safe, familiar environment; if extroverted, then trip with someone you trust.

				I purchased 20 of peaceful&#039;s love heart tabs. Received em in the mail very promptly, good stealth.<br /><br />The tabs came as 2 lots of 2x10 love heart pictures which I had to cut up myself (easiest thing in the world) along with one bonus one from the old heads tails comp and nearly a whole tabs worth of offcuts :). Couldnt&#039;ve been happier, till I tested them.<br /><br />4 people tested the tabs, taking 1 - 2 each, all reported terrific results. I can see why peaceful says his LSD is pure, I think that was the cleanest acid experience I&#039;ve had, no stomach discomfort, no scattered feeling afterwards, top. shelf. stuff.<br /><br />As for the dosage I&#039;d say 150ug is maybe even the minimum you&#039;d get on one tab, everyone who tested with me is pretty experienced with tabs, it can take a bit to get us going, but all of us were flying very high that day.<br /><br />Communication with seller was good also, assured me i&#039;d get my delivery before I went away which is just great service

				Well I must say that I am interested but I&#039;m also keenly aware that all the actual reviews here have been posted by members with only a single post. The other detailed trip review comes from Peaceful himself. That could appear to be slightly dodgy if I was a skeptical kind of guy.<br />I&#039;m pretty excited to think that we might have a decent Australian vendor for LSD. I don&#039;t mind using the OS vendors but there is a long wait and I have had one package never make it. I doubt that it was actually sent but there is always the &#039;customs&#039; excuse.<br />Have any senior members used Peaceful&#039;s product and care to make a comment?

				Yes, all of these reviews have been left by users with 1 post, but none of them have been left by me, I can assure you that.<br /><br />If you take as much LSD as I have in your life, you only have love for everyone and everything.&nbsp; I would never lie/cheat/steal from anyone, and you will see this if you place an order with me.<br /><br />I am extremely reasonable and always go above and beyond for my customers.<br /><br />I sent a senior forum member a sample of my LSD yesterday for free so he can do a detailed review for me.&nbsp; I asked him to lab test, reagent test and sample himself.&nbsp; Basically I want him to test it as thoroughly as he can because I am sure of my product (I make it, you don&#039;t get more sure than that).<br /><br />Anyway, please look at the hundreds of reviews on my vendor page, I have over 300 transactions and 100% positive feedback.&nbsp; You don&#039;t get that by selling bunk products :-)<br /><br />Peace!<br />Peaceful

				Try to also consider the fact that I have sold over 2000 of these tabs with a public forum readily available for feedback.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone received bunk product, I&#039;m sure there would have been a review here by now :-P <br /><br />Generally, if people aren&#039;t happy with the product, they will ALWAYS write a negative review.&nbsp; Generally, people that are happy with the product, continue with their lives as normal because they got what they expected and they gain nothing from leaving a good detailed review.<br /><br />Peace!<br />Peaceful

				played some video games. After a while (30 mins or so) I started getting that fuzzy feeling in the back of my head which is like First up- THANKYOU Peaceful for making it possible to try lsd of this quality!&nbsp; <br /><br />Me and a mate decided to give the tabs a go on the Friday after receiving them in the mail. Previously we would usually have 3 tabs each to start a trip but we thought we would just have a small trip and took 2. Those two tabs gave me more vivid visuals than I have ever had before.&nbsp; <br /><br />While waiting for the effects to start we an&nbsp; alarm bell telling me that soon I will be tripping hard! We stopped playing games and turned on some jefferson airplane and let the lsd take hold. <br /><br />Slowly my lounge room started to distort, the large Window with the city lights in the background started to fish eye. There were hexagon colored patterns over everything while my carpet and walls were breathing.&nbsp; Both me and my friend were laughing together and bonding like only a good trip does!&nbsp; <br /><br />We both discussed how much better this was than ANY previous trip. At one point I was convinced that I could see sound waves.. but seems unlikely now. I felt like I had dare devil level senses and could still see.&nbsp; <br /><br />We decided to try to draw.. we couldnt find any paper so we used a drawing program on my friends tablet. We could not work out if the drawing program was interactive because it seemed v like it was constantly morphing... later a friend who was sober told us it looked like we were just scribbling for an hour.&nbsp; <br /><br />The closed eyed visuals were EPIC! My closed eyed visuals are always following whatever music I am listening to... this time I had SO MUCH more than just patterns.&nbsp; I saw detailed pictures develop in front of me.. I felt amazing. <br /><br />There was a point v when we had some sober people join us.. that was not the best. <br /><br />I am just counting down the days until I can get out of the city and take this in the day! <br /><br />So much gratitude for the product peaceful has brought into my life! <br /><br />Thank you!!! <br /><br />

				Received some LSD from Peaceful this week, I&#039;ll be posting a review up of the acid itself and my trip once I get a chance to try it (with a bit of luck this weekend), but all received perfectly and the tabs look good :) <br /><br />Shipping time couldn&#039;t be quicker, easy and quick communication and packaging was perfect for the order. Must admit I&#039;d only ever flicked past this vendor as I haven&#039;t had\bought LSD in almost a year now. As far as my experience goes though I&#039;ve had some (in my opinion) accurately dosed 150ug tabs in the past, as well as more standard 90-100ug doses than I care to count.. And for the most part all locally made Australian LSD as well so I should have a good base for comparison :) <br /><br />Thanks again Peaceful, really looking forward to trying it and keep on doing what you do and putting out &#039;dem good vibes.

I have been around the road for a year now so have seen the LSD scene go through some antics.&#039; Matrix&#039; was a classic case. We liked his acid even though the doses were overstated but he ended up being full of shit and ripping everyone off after 1000&#039;s of sales. <br />I recognise that there are over 300 feedback comments on your page and that&#039;s what gets me wondering. 300 sales totalling over 2000 tabs and the best we can do is a few reviews from single post members on the forum? <br />Not that the number of posts is always indicative. I&#039;m listed as a newbie but have been around for a year and tried LSD from several vendors. I just don&#039;t have much time to spend on the forums. <br /><br />Looks like Moksha however is going to give us something that I will be very interested in. I for one will be a definite customer if I think that you really have the goods. Domestic LSD ... hell yeah! ...but I&#039;m not interested in buying RC&#039;s labelled as LSD. I don&#039;t mind RC&#039;s but I like to know what I&#039;m taking. I&#039;m also very pleased that if you make and lay the acid then you should be well aware of the ug content on each tab and therefore we are getting an accurate dose. That is something that I really like to know. I can pretty much guage a dose now from 60ug up to about 300ug by feel but I would much rather know exactly how much I am taking so that I can take it as a single dose at the start. I don&#039;t care what dose is on the tabs, its me knowing the dose that&#039;s important. Jersey Cow&#039;s recent Gandalfs were spot on at 145 - 155 ug I&#039;d say.<br />I take acid for different reasons. Sometimes a low doses of acid can be an extraordinary learning enhancer for example but it is such a waste of time having half a 150ug tab and 1 1/2 hours later having to re-dose because the tab only had 60ug to begin with. <br /><br />You said that LSD was not that hard to make....hats off to you my friend because my understanding of chemistry tells me it is very difficult indeed. I am a lover of fine LSD and I look forward to trying your product after some reviews from members of the community here that I have come to trust over the past year. The road has come a long way with acid vendors in the past year and I would happily welcome a domestic vendor of quality to the community.<br /><br />Roobix<br />

				Hi,<br /><br />No worries at all Roobix, I can&#039;t wait for you to try my product and leave a trip report.&nbsp; Satisfaction or your money back.<br /><br />I say making LSD is easy, but that&#039;s only because the person I have teamed up with is very experienced.&nbsp; When I say it&#039;s easy to make LSD but extremely difficult to get it this pure, basically what I mean is that if we made it at 70% purity we could LITERALLY make almost 3 times as many blotters.&nbsp; <br /><br />This acid is 91.4% pure, which means on each blotter there is 137ug of PURE LSD.&nbsp; Sometimes people advertise 150ug, but it&#039;s with 70% pure LSD so really you&#039;re only getting 105ug and there are impurities that can make the trip bad.&nbsp; The ergot is grown by us, and this isn&#039;t something that my team member has only done once and it was no accident obviously :-)&nbsp; you can try make ghetto mdma or ghetto speed but never LSD.&nbsp; This is the product of hard work for 15 years by an experienced organic chemist.&nbsp; We have kept all the records of chromosomes for the last 8 years and have been comparing DNA of the ergot that has given the best trip and this is the best one in our opinion.&nbsp; From that we extract the ET and from that LSD.<br /><br />On top of that, none of the chemicals are available in Aus now, so everything is made completely from scratch.&nbsp; This is completely made in Australia, with plenty of love and extreme attention to detail, just wonderful LSD that will blow most of the LSD you&#039;ve had in the past out of the water.&nbsp; Please do check reviews on our vendor page, there are plenty of comments that reinforce this.<br /><br />Love and Peace my friends!

				Hey Guys, just putting in a trip report after taking Peaceful&#039;s LSD.<br /><br />First of all this was my first time with this product but is by a long way not my first time using LSD (15+ trips)<br />this is actually my first time buying off silk road and it is so impressive the quality of stuff you can get.<br /><br />so getting into it. I dropped around 4:30 in the afternoon with a friend while we were watching BBC&#039;s Wonders of the Universe, had one and a half tabs to myself and half a tab for my friend.<br /><br />5:15: first noticed that the trip was getting started as my friend started to sit there and giggle at the amazing colours that were coming out of the screen for him, for myself it was another 15mins before I noticed myself getting there and I felt as if the show we were watching was extremely intense and everything around started to flow really nicely. I started to move around and felt extremely energetic so we basically roamed around our small residence finding things that entertained us. <br /><br />6pm: two more of our friends came around and both had 1 tab each and were extremely entertained by how much fun we were having, I have never before had visuals from acid after many many times using, but this was the first time where I had experienced it in the form of synesthesia, giving me a small time where certain sounds would induce different colours being formed in front of me and the same thing when I closed my eyes. My friend who dropped earlier with me was looking at pictures on his phone and was enjoying that fact that some photos were growing out of his phone and forming amazing psychedelic patterns and colours in front of him and on his hands. this basically gave him two hours of solid entertainment. I spent the next hour and a half basically roaming around the house being consumed by my own movement.<br /><br />8pm: my two friends who dropped later were now in the midst of their trip and consumed by a video which was giving them extremely intense visuals and a great amount of enjoyment. I had entered the stage I like to call the crack stage where I roam, build, explore and just generally find the funnest parts of my environment, I extremely enjoy this part of my acids trips and this lasted me well onto about midnight which is the longest I have ever experience this and it was extremely fun to have this being a big part of my night.<br /><br />12pm: after a bit of convincing I got all of my friends to come for a walk in the rain with me down to a local river that we live near, we starting walking in extremely light rain which was very sensual and the feeling of it on my skin caused me to really be uplifted and my jaw is still sore from the amount of smiling that I was doing that night. one of my friends said she was able to see amazing amounts of colour around because of the light reflections in the rain drops. we ended up sitting and watching the flow of the river for about 2 hours in this light drizzle because of the amazement that we found in the area that we were in.<br /><br />2am: at this point we headed back to the house and roamed around a bit more finding fun stuff to entertain us, we poured glow stick fluid into detergent and made glow in the dark bubbles which we blew around the back yard and caused a great amount of fun for all of us and we continued this for another hour or so.<br /><br />after this I lost track of time a little bit as I was just very active for the rest of the night until about 6am when I went to bed.<br />I woke up after a decent sleep and felt amazing the next day and today two days later I am still feeling the lovely acid afterglow which is definitely making my days feel nicer. <br /><br />everyone who tried this LSD with me said that the next day they felt great and had absolutely no ill effects. <br /><br />I am extremely impressed with this product and I would definitely recommend everyone to try it and I immediately got another order the next day so that I could share it with more friends. Thanks for bringing this product to us Peaceful!! <br /><br />Cheers<br />NCZ

				Hey guys, please find my review of the LSD below:<br /><br />I placed an order for 10 tabs on Tuesday, I must have selected the wrong PGP key while encrypting my message and received a message on Wednesday from Peaceful advising as such, I replaced the order and it was still sent out on the same day and received the next, with an extra tab thrown in, very happy with the service.<br /><br />I have had LSD I&#039;d say about 15 times or so, the first time being new years eve this year. I&#039;ve purchased LSD from about 6 or so different vendors on SR, all international except for Peaceful and one other AUS vendor; although it was only 2 tabs from that vendor. My regular international vendor is on holidays so I thought I&#039;d give Peaceful a try, the price was pretty good and it worked out not much more than purchasing international especially when I factored in the extra tab, the next day delivery and near impossible getting lost in the post etc.<br /><br />Anyway, I usually prefer to trip alone, as I did this time, my usual dosage is between 2-4 tabs usually tested between 150-200ug per tab. It had been 4-6 weeks since my previous trip.<br /><br />10pm: I dropped 3 of Peaceful&#039;s tabs on Friday night at 10pm, by 10:30pm I could definitely feel the come up, very little nausea, at this dose I feel a bit of nausea is always going to be felt on the come up, at least in my experience. I put on some music and did some random internet surfing until about 11pm when it was starting to ramp up, I noticed the subtle vibrations around objects that made me look twice.<br /><br />11pm: I always enjoy watching movies on acid and usually when I am tripping alone I try to get in at least one, I&#039;ve been told I&#039;m crazy but I most enjoy horror movies when I&#039;m tripping, as well as Sci-Fi/close encounter movies etc, I enjoy the intensity that these movies create when combined with acid. I decided to watch a movie called &quot;The Girl Next Door (2007)&quot;, based on a true story, it was definitely an intense experience and at times unsettling, the screen was popping out with vibrant colours and I was very engrossed in the movie. <br /><br />12pm: Half way through the movie, I decided to vaporize some weed out of my Da Buddha Vape, put on my earphones/music and I went out to my backyard, the stars were glowing and looked awesome, I have a few fruit trees out the back, lemons, oranges etc, they were popping out and hardly looked real, the breeze felt great. I came back inside and remember just standing in the door way of my kitchen and watching the room, I have these titled floors that have a pattern that just comes alive on acid, It&#039;s actually what I use to gauge how &quot;high&quot; I am during a trip; how much is my floor rotating lol. Definitely one of my best trips visual-wise.<br /><br />12:30am: I came back and finished the movie, in hindsight it&#039;s probably a movie I wouldn&#039;t have chosen to watch while tripping just because it was a more a story about child abuse than it was horror-like, still a well made movie. <br /><br />1:30am: At this point my room/walls was just melting/rotating around, it was pretty amusing and I just sat on my couch, vaporized some more weed and just watched and let my thoughts run. Decided to drink some Coke Zero, usually I don&#039;t get a craving to drink much more than Juice/Cordial/Water etc but Coke tasted great and went down well this time. Also had some snacks (yes, I&#039;m one that likes to eat a bit while tripping). <br /><br />2:30am: Lost track of time and ended up just doing a mixture of listening to some new music I had, watching TV, went out side for awhile and just watched my surroundings, again the visuals were fun. Put on another movie &quot;Mirrors&quot; - horror movie involving mirrors lol.. It was OK, less intense than the other one, more fun, at least for my taste.<br /><br />7am-9am: Went to bed but didn&#039;t sleep, just rested, I usually can&#039;t sleep at all after acid, until the next night, my floor had mostly stopped moving at this point.. still felt pretty good during the day though.<br /><br />Had a good night, very happy with the product, felt clean and energetic, I&#039;ll be back for more, thanks Peaceful!<br /><br />Regards,<br />Sekt0r.

				Here is my detailed review for Peacefuls LSD.<br /><br />This was my first time on LSD. I bought 10 tabs from Peaceful, and they arrived VERY quickly (within 2 days), with great stealth.<br />I dropped them with my roommates on the Friday night after receiving them. We had 1 each to begin with, but as expected because of my anti-depressants, I wasn&#039;t feeling it as much as I would have liked (they were tripping balls, so it was nothing to do with the product quality, just my damn medication!)... So I took another. An hour or two later and BOOM, I was the happiest person in the world, and I felt completely weightless.<br />The roommates went to scab some cigarettes from a friend which involved us walking outside. Outside was the best thing in the world, so we decided to take our bong out the front of the college and sit on the stairs while we smoked up. This is when it really hit. The visuals were so great. It was like when you cook a gas BBQ, and you see the ripples of the gas vapours in the air, expect it was right in front of my eyes. I was loving it. Then I started losing sense of time and distance. Everything I did or thought about took a LONG time, but it was so great that time stretched out like that and I could enjoy it more. We laughed together, shared our deepest thoughts, listened to some amazing music and watched TV. Everything was perfect.<br />I didn&#039;t go to bed until about 4:00AM and slept like a baby. I woke up so refreshed and didn&#039;t have any after-effects (except everything was super vivid in the sun in the morning).<br />I know it was my first trip, but after reading a lot of reports from other products, I know that it was a great trip. I had a tonne of fun and can&#039;t wait to get onto it again.<br />If you&#039;re considering buying from Peaceful, think no longer about it. A great seller and great product. Thanks mate!

				Fairly new to LSD but have lots of experience with Shrooms and recently DMT thanks to the wonderful SR.&nbsp; LSD in the past for me has always tasted &quot;metalic&quot; and trips never felt clean, apart from my first and second time.&nbsp; This has led me to believe that most tabs and vials on the street are crappy research chemicals, but due to the aussie &quot;lets get fucked up&quot; culture, very few people educate themselves about the &quot;drugs&quot; they put in their bodies.&nbsp; So people actually believe these chemicals such as NBOMe and other Research chemicals are LSD-25. <br /><br />After coming across Peaceful on SR I had a very strong urge to try proper LSD.&nbsp; After receiving what i had no doubt was the best acid I had ever come across decided to drop 2 tabs to get a proper feel for this famous molecule.&nbsp; I am not going to go into much detail about my trip because I could write all night.&nbsp; But it was exactly what I had expected plus more.&nbsp; Felt cleaner than anything I had ever had before, also never had visuals like this!&nbsp; Came close to DMT experiences when I laid down and meditated.&nbsp; Was an amazing experience and I am looking forward to my next trip. <br /><br />I also believe that if you are reading this you need to make it your mission to share this wonderful psychedelic with as many people as you can!!!!!!

				I purchased some of Peaceful&#039;s acid... and it is exactly what I have been looking for. The cleanest acid I&#039;ve had in a very long time.<br /><br />Purchased 10, probably should have got 20 haha.<br /><br />I had an interesting trip:<br /><br />3pm: Dropped a single tab on my upper gum (my preference) and just spent 30min watching adventure time.<br /><br />3:30pm: I swallowed the tab and I felt hungry, so I made some food.<br />So far the transition has been a pretty smooth ride.<br /><br />4pm: Ok at this point I was tripping out, amazing CEV and OEV. I put on some M83, which I consider amazing to trip to (Massive Attack is also pretty mind blowing). <br /><br />4:30pm: So yeah, I have a complete inability to sit in my chair; I had ended up on the floor for the next 2 hours which felt like around 5 hours. I had the most important realizations about the world, my life and where I am at this point. I made the decision that I need to move on from where I am, there is not much left here for me.<br /><br />9pm: I peaked for about 4hours and around now I was starting to come down. I felt like I could eat more now, so I heated up some soup, which ended up being a complete mess haha. I normally enjoy eating while tripping, but usually for the interesting texture, not taste or nourishment.<br /><br />2am: I am pretty drained by this point, but I stay up for a while longer to get closer to baseline before attempting sleep :)<br /><br />4am: Finally asleep, what an amazing trip to have.<br /><br />I really want to thankyou Peaceful; you have provided an amazing tool to help me understand myself much more. From the 15 or so acid trips I&#039;ve had, this was the most.. productive to say the least.<br /><br />I had no chemical taste that is familiar with 25i or 25c. The real fucking deal.<br /><br />Peace out!

				Wow, my most recent trip was crazy. My order contained 10 tabs (one half of 5 cut slightly smaller than the other) plus 3 additional half-tabs (I suppose to make up for the slightly smaller half?)<br /><br />I decided to take one of the slightly smaller ones, as well as the 3 loose tabs (no idea what the dosage was, but I normally take between 120ug and 300ug; 150uh brings the most comfortable experiences for me).<br /><br />Ingested at 8:15am (I always swallow my blotters), started feeling effects at around 8:40am. By 9:00am I was well into the trip, poked around on the computer, listened to music and just laid around for 1-2 hours.<br /><br />Then somewhere between 10:30am and 11:59am I went to take a piss and couldn&#039;t walk properly, the act of standing up was incredibly nauseating - I vomited 3 times (never happened before) and didn&#039;t know wtf was happening! XD So I just remained lying down for the entire day.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t stand up at all without experiencing an overpowering urge to vomit, even 14 hours into the trip (10pm), everything I looked at was moving lightning fast so I also kept my eyes closed from 11am to about 7pm. I experienced intense pain in the centre of the chest which lasted from lunch to about midnight. I felt incredibly drained (both physically and mentally) the entire next day!<br /><br />All that negativity aside, the initial stages of the trip were quite pleasant and filled wonderful insights. No regrets, that was without a doubt the most important trip I&#039;ve had to date. though I&#039;ve no desire to try that high a dose in the future, I think I&#039;ll stick to 150ug, where I can actually get up, paint and do shit! (but I can&#039;t help but wonder exactly how much I ingested; it could&#039;ve been anything from 400-700! Crazy!)

				Hi<br />First of all I must say, Thanks for a wonderful product and extremely quick delivery and for helping me get one of the best weekends of my life ^^. <br />So I live in a shared house with 3 other people together with my girlfriend on the friday 2 of the guys was havin a small party(we were 7 all together) and we decided to join in. After drinkin a bit the conversation went in on drugs and then to me havin the lsd.<br />Everyone was really keen on takin it(2 never tried before, rest was fairly experienced). So we decided on half a tab each, handed it out around 9.30.<br />After 30mins everyone started to feel some. I got more energy and started to feel the music everything got enhanced.<br />The conversations started to go all over the place. There were balls lying around so we started juggeling, haha. <br /><br />Around 11 everyone decided to head out. Me and my Gf and another flatmate stayed to finish a joint while the other 4 headed out.<br /><br />We continue talking, laughing, dancing, juggeling then went out and looked at local street art. The colors were absolutely AMAZING.<br />Suddenly a phone rings, its the other guys wondering were we were. It was now 1am and they had come back to see the door locked and none home. We headed back. At this stage everyone was completely fucked, but in an awesome way. <br />We continued drinkin and talking till about 4. Me and my gf went back in the room had some of the best sex ever, the feelin was incredible..... went to bed around 5.30<br /><br />Saterday&nbsp; <br />Got upp aroud 9, had a lot to do during the day.<br />In the evening me and my gf had invited over a friend(call him M and he had never done acid before) for some more fun.<br />We took half a tab each a bit after 9.30.&nbsp; About 10 M said he started to feel a bit, he started to move his feet with rythem of the music. Me and GF didn&#039;t feel to much since the last day so we took the other half and I put on some mushie tea.<br />10.30 <br />Everyone was feeling it now, the music was getting better and better, I started to see a lot of patterns everywhere and started to see small eyes everywhere as well(ALways gets this when I start seein things, friends fault -.-) . M and GF were dancing like crazy while I was enjoying the views :). I finished my tea around 11.<br />11.30 <br />Started to feel the tea as well and the OEV started. I was watching my GF dancing to daft punk and by relaxing my eyes and letting them do the work she started to move in the air and the whole room started to shift, colors changing, it was incredible. I was clear in my head but the communication skills on everyone was starting to go down.<br />After about 1am everyone had lost their speech only bein able to say a couple of words.<br />At this point I had both OEV and CEV which was so cool, it felt like the music took me for a journey, I could see myself dancing to the music and feeling my whole body do it even do I was perfectly still on the couch and every once in a while I open my eyes seeiing M and GF dancing the same way.<br />2.30(I got my speech back now, the others not)<br />We go out and look at the street art again and it&#039;s even better today, while they are watching some pictures I walk to a parking lot with surrounding street art and start walking around looking at it. I start getting closer to something I think is big rocks(why would there be rocks ?!) After getting closer I realize it&#039;s 2 people sitting on the ground looking at the art. I turn quickly around I leave. I tell GF and M the story and they look confused. We go back, but GF decide to have a look for the rocks(people). She forgets what she is doing and suddenly walks closer to them and suddenly they stand up and walk quickly away, She then did the same and more or less ran to us(Me and M saw this from a balcony, looked so funny).<br />4<br />We are still going I still got OEV and CEV, they still can&#039;t stop dancing, I start to juggeling at this stage. Was an incredible feeling, got the balls in the rythem of the music and felt amazing.<br />5<br />I start to come down a wee bit, the visuals start to go down. The others are still going, I decide I&#039;m ready to go to sleep. They can&#039;t communicate still but decide to continue. It&#039;s around 5.30 when I finally get to bed.<br />I wake up at 10.30, walks out in the living room and they are still going....<br />I took GF to bed.<br /><br />Overall 2 fucking awesome days. Looking forward to do it again :)<br /><br />Thanks again Peaceful for a great product it&#039;s by far the best I have tried and it didn&#039;t leave you with any bad effects the day after(more than sleepy for not sleeping ^^).<br />

				Peaceful, firstly, an apology for doubting your product my friend. <br />I am absolutely tripping off my nuts at the moment. ;D<br />I took 2 of your tabs tonight. I waited for a few hours before I had a smoke. I wanted to see what the acid was like on its own. I&#039;m not ultrakeen on LSD on its own, it always takes a bit of weed to get it going for me. This is some fine acid.<br />I&#039;d say you are spot on with the dose, 300ug is producing OEV geometrics over just about everything.<br />I have just the finest faintist sulphur feeling in the back of my throat that I get when the acid <br />is really good. It also makes the red wine I&#039;m drinking a special something... yeah slight mind fuck for a minute there but whatever??<br />Anyway this is good shit. <br />Maybe I&#039;ll write more later or go sing about your acid on the other forums.&nbsp; <br />Roobix<br /><br />7 hrs later,<br /><br />OK so I wrote all that last night but Tor or the forum site was being a dick... I dunno, Saturday night regional Australian slowness or something, probably to do with the election, I couldn&#039;t end up posting it. I swear it felt like it was doing it on purpose to me because I was tripping so hard and could barely type and it would just keep timing out. <br />Anyway, it’s the morning after I feel great enough to get on here and sing your praises a bit more.<br /><br />I couldn’t wait any longer for Moksha’s trip report so I just decided to have a punt on you regardless.<br />I sampled the extra half you threw in, last Monday just to see what this was like and it felt good so last night I dosed up properly. <br />Another of your customers said that this is up there with the best acid in the world and I have to agree. I had some of Vitacat&#039;s 300ug Mayas last year that were the bomb! I&#039;ve been lamenting that I didn&#039;t buy 50 instead of 10. Well lamentation is now gone. This acid is just as good as the Mayas. Best visuals I&#039;ve had since then. No body load at all just the faint throat feel that I described above and I quite like that- the flavour of LSD.&nbsp; <br />I think that I drank too much red wine in the end... it tasted so fucking awesome. I seriously thought that it was the best red I&#039;d ever had and I could smell the vanilla chocolate in it. I thought that wine labels were full of it, now I know that the writers have probably just had a solid dose of your acid before describing, he, he&nbsp; <br /><br />Seriously though, great product man. About the right price I guess.. I mean, I&#039;d like it if it was cheaper as I could buy more….<br />but I probably will anyway.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />You are now the number 1 acid vendor on the road for me, hands down. <br /><br />Yeah lastly, I like LSD artwork and am looking forward to seeing what you choose as your signature sheet design. The white paper is OK but one of Alex Greys magical fractilating designs would describe this stuff perfectly. There is absolutely 0 taste from these tabs. I can usually taste the slight, slight bitterness of acid but I didn&#039;t get anything from these and there was no ink taste - that&#039;s a bonus. So yeah whatever, change if you want but don&#039;t change the acid... unless you decide to put it through the column once more to make it better!<br />Congratulate your chemist for me please!<br />Roobix<br />

				I would love if you placed one add about sending the cure for cancer systematicly to all homeadresses in a country, I would pay alot to get that ball rolling since the cure for cancer was found 84 years ago and he got a nobelprize for finding the cure for cancer so people would not be able to deny the info that came in a letter from a unknown vendor on Silkroad. They say 1 in 3 will get cancer so if you did this and wrote in the letter how people can find your add and pay to get more letters sent out to peoples homeadresses.<br /><br />Lets say you give the option for people to chose what country the letters will be sent to and if you write in the add where all the letters are sent then you would probably be able to become a millionair very fast since 3 of 3 people is afraid to be the 1 in 3 who gets cancer, and if people see the cure for cancer and how to join the spreading of the cure for cancer thru giving a anonymous payment then alot of people would do that.<br /><br />just think about the people who had relatives that died from cancer because they kept the cure for cancer in the dark for 84 years so they can make huge money from acting like they are searchin for a cure that has already been found.. 84+ years ago.<br /><br />So thats what I wish you had for sale, the service of copying the letter and placing them in cheap envelopes and give people the option to pay like 10 bucks for 10 letters to spread the cure that the media ignores to talk about.<br /><br />

				I have experience with international LSD before, specifically I have had two trips where I had a 100uG hoffman each, two trips where I had a 150uG Gandalf each and one trip where I had 2 150uG Gandalf. .<br /><br />Last Saturday I had a trip with two of the tabs from peaceful.....AND THEY BLEW THESE AWAY!!!!<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical of Peaceful claiming international tabs were 70% purity and his were 91%, so I decided to take 2 of his 150ug tabs and compare it to my last trip where I had 2 150uG gandalf tabs.<br /><br />First of all, Peaceful&#039;s tabs did not have any bitter taste at all while the Gandalf&#039;s tabs did a bit... maybe due to impurities?<br /><br />2nd of all the trip with 2 of Peaceful&#039;s tabs were significantly stronger than two gandalf&#039;s tab, therefore I believe that Peaceful&#039;s claim of 91% purity is legit.<br /><br />Now for the trip report.<br /><br />At 7pm, I took 2 tabs, held them underneath my tongue and let them stay there for 45 minutes....<br /><br />At around 8pm I started getting the fuzzy feeling in my stomach, I normally get these with LSD and is a nice feeling.<br /><br />At around 8.30 PM, I start to see rainbows and start grinning a lot for no apparent reason ( I usually do this if the dosage of LSD is quite high, &gt;200uG)<br /><br />at around 9PM the visual starts to kick in, I could see rainbows, this time it was significantly more visually intense that the 2xgandalf trip<br /><br />The visual keeps getting more intense until 11 PM, by now my thoughts are tripping out and I cannot make any coherent speeches or thoughts. When looking at photos on the phone, these real life pictures literally turned in colour outlines, as if someone traced around it in paint shop.. I never had these before... I guess you get these the more higher dosage you go..<br /><br />peaking at around 12 am but by now I stop grinning , have more coherent thoughts and can make proper speech<br /><br />LSD slowly comes down, by 7 AM i still have some visuals.<br /><br />Overall this LSD is the real deal!

				Just thought I&#039;d bump this up a bit.<br /><br />Ordered from Peaceful and received it very fast, with good stealth. Questions were answered promptly, and in a helpful manner.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried yet, but if all the trip reports before me are anything to go by, I&#039;m in for a great time.

				Hey guys<br /><br />So here is my experience. <br /><br />Now, I am a bit concerned as no one else is experiencing what I am experiencing. I was hoping for Moksha&#039;s report before I posted mine for a bit of confirmation. Anyways...<br /><br />I will start with this. Peaceful is an excellent vendor. He shipped out the tabs in no time and even had an extra half. Anyone who does this is already a +1 in my books. He also had good comms so no complaints there. So I am in no way trying to slander his reputation as a seller as it is top notch. <br /><br />So I got my 10.5 tabs and I planned to take them with a friend. <br /><br />For a bit of history. Both of us have had extensive experience in LSD and hallucinogenic RC&#039;s. We both know how to go about our shit. So I hear all these awesome reviews of Peaceful&#039;s LSD and so for the first one we take 1 tab each an see what happens. <br /><br />No chemical taste, good start. Good smooth come-up. Even better. Start tripping, around the 45min mark. All good signs of LSD. It is however low key at one tab. Nothing wrong with that. And we have a good time. Come to the 5 hour mark things start to slow down and we both start to question the quality of these tabs. It seemed that the trip had come in &quot;one hit&quot;, plateaued, and then started waning. Now this is not like LSD at all. At about the 6 hour mark the visuals are disappearing and we are getting tired. Needles to say, both of us were asleep by the 9th our of the trip, without any help! Now we both wake up in the morning and think something is wrong. No LSD would wear off by the 6th hour and let you comfortably sleep by the 9th hour!<br /><br />But we shrug our shoulders and go, we will take 2 tabs next time and wee what happens. <br /><br />So about 1.5 weeks later, enough for a tolerance to wear off, we take 2 tabs each. Same beginning, no taste, smooth come-up. We think we maybe misjudged the first trip as by 1.5 hours we are truly tripping balls. But, to our utter dismay, by the 6th hour it begins to wear off again and once again by the 9 - 10th hour this time, we are both sound asleep. <br /><br />Now in my history of using hallucinogens, this wave length of trip does not belong to pure LSD. <br /><br />To consolidate: We experienced a 45 min come-up and and full bang of a trip for the first few hours. It then plateaued to nice relaxing visuals and feelings and then started to dip. <br /><br />This type of thing reminds me so much of RC chemicals. Example: 2CE is a bang of a trip and then a plateau and then a slow come down. And the more you take, the bigger the bang, but not the longer the trip. <br /><br />However, LSD, in my experience anyway, comes in waves and dips and doesn&#039;t reveal itself in this bang like effect. And most importantly lasts at least 12 hours! Weak LSD lasts up to 9. But still operates on a different wave length. And the more you take, the longer and more intense the trip becomes, it does not create a bigger first effect. <br /><br />So we begin to question. What could it be? No way it is Nbomes of sorts as there would be a distinct chemical taste. No way it is a 2c-x as they are required in mg doses. <br /><br />So, we are actually stumped. It is most likely LSD. But just different to what we know. <br /><br />But the reason I am posting this is because I want to know if this is what other people have been experiencing. All these trip reports saying this is LSD from heaven seem so farfetched now that I have tried it. It is most certainty not the best trips I am had. <br /><br />Once again, I in no way mean to damage Peaceful&#039;s reputation as we still received a good product and we had fun. But was it what I was expecting? Not so much. <br /><br />Would love to hear your responses. <br /><br />DG

				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to hear you&#039;re disappointed.&nbsp; We make the LSD ourselves, it&#039;s definitely LSD.&nbsp; People can be affected quite differently by LSD and trips can be affected by set and setting.<br /><br />There&#039;s not much we can really do here to argue who is right or wrong, so I&#039;ll just leave this offer here:<br /><br />We are so confident our product is &gt;90% purity LSD, we will pay anyone who has access to lab testing facilities $250 to lab test our product.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can&#039;t try to make LSD and come up with a psychedelic that gives you a good experience by accident that isn&#039;t LSD.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like you can grow ergot, extract ET and somehow mess up the synthesis to arrive at 2CE or any other research chemical.<br /><br />Peace and love my friends!

				Reporting back from my psychonautical exploration. I&#039;m an experienced psilocybin and one-time DMT user, so I used those as my standards of comparison. I hadn&#039;t done acid before (apart from one bunk tab) so I am not an expert on what fantastic acid is supposed to be like, but I had read information and trip reports and so had a basic idea about what a proper acid trip is supposed to entail. Athough I attempted, of course, to enter the trip with no preformed expectations.<br /><br />Woke up around 11am. Dropped one tab, under the tongue, went for a smoke and some water. Started feeling it around 11:50am - noticeable shifts, drifting shadows, blurring vision, giddiness. The cobalt brushstrokes of one of the oil paintings in the hallway shifted as I glanced it on the way to my bedroom, which I cleaned up a little to make it a little less chaotic (my mind would be chaotic enough).<br /><br />Open eye visuals were apparent, and I enjoyed watching my hand constantly transform into a gnarled old claw and back. I dropped another half tab at around 12:30am and continued recording my observations in handwriting, although my hand and body was trembling and the paper appeared to breath slightly and it was becoming difficult to write legibly. So I decided to switch to art and started drawing in coloured pencil. <br /><br />The delightful thing I noticed about tripping on acid was that instead of leaving me sluggish and lethargic like shrooms, I felt light, energetic and restless. Unlike the heavy body load of shrooms, which gives you the palpable sensation of experiencing your own mortal body decaying, every breath a conscious effort, your heart beating hard, my body felt slightly sedated and pain free. In contrast to shrooms, my mind was lucid, the closed-eye visuals were clearer, and I felt in control of myself at all times - no chance of a segue into an unexpected mindfuck. <br /><br />Around 2pm, I went outside into the backyard and lay on the grass. The sky was a brilliant, faultless blue and the weather was comfortably warm, althought it was windy. I closed my eyes and shut out the environment, deciding to pretend that I was dead. The wind constantly rustling the leaves of the trees under which I was lying sounded like the waves of the ocean lapping at the shores of the beach. The wind chimes were tinkling spasmodically. I could hear the paws and soft huffs of my dogs as they padded around nearby on the grass.<br /><br />In my mind, I visualised dark rotating matrices and posterised tendrils and vivid kaleidoscoped images that were incredibly lucid. I started to perceive the nature of intuition and thought, the systems 1 and 2 that were running my mind. <br /><br />As I lay there competely motionless on my stomach, trying to die, it I felt and visualised that the gusts of wind were disassembling my molecules into the universe, and insects and microbes had started to crawl into my nostrils and up my legs and over my body trying to start the process of decomposition. Pain, from the hard knobbly surface of the grassy incline digging into my check, was rendered as visuals, but it was relegated to a lesser and controllable sensation that could be brushed aside. I felt completely and utterly at peace at the notion that I would die then and there. <br /><br />This was all a dream, a dream of a person before me. His last dying dream was my life, a spectacular one, all things considered. And then when I would die, I would have one last dream, and that dream would give birth to a new consciousness. And so on. Grasping life&#039;s infinite regress was a marvellous relevation. Man&#039;s curiosity, the efforts of science and religion, is directed towards finding that first person who died, the proto-dreamer.<br /><br />Having done with that thought experiment, I tried the experiment of trying to eject my ego. Not in the way that the shocking soul-shattering blast of DMT does, but in a more conscious, step-by-step way. I could zoom out from my body, further and further, trying to encompass the nature of the entire planet and universe inside my mind and my small part of it, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn&#039;t get rid of the &#039;my&#039; and the &#039;I&#039;, I couldn&#039;t quite depart from the tether of my mortal body. Tendrils slithered up and grasped the stalk of my escalating thought and soul before it could completely project itself into the unknown. <br /><br />So I couldn&#039;t quite shake my ego, but it was a good realisation that I couldn&#039;t. I sat down around 2:30pm, and having abandoned the idea of scribing my observations, dictated them as best I could into my phone&#039;s voice recorder, while smoking my menthol cigarettes. <br /><br />I realised the futility of constantly trying to record each and every observation during a trip. It is like trying to grasp what is ungraspable. It is better to try and live as mindfully as you can while trying a trip and go with the flow instead of trying to encode your every thought and feeling like some detatched anthropologist.<br />I decided to eat some food, since I could feel hunger in my stomach, and so I ate some noodles (plain but nice texture) and a banana (one of the most sweetest, nuanced bananas I&#039;ve ever had). I then went upstairs and drew some more. I kept moving upstairs and down, inside and out, restless, listening to different pieces of music. Around 4:30pm I went outside and enjoyed the setting sunlight and playing with my dog and running my hands over the brittle, fractured bark of the big tree outside. <br /><br />I went back inside, had some food, and wrote some emails and IMs to people, which consumed some time. When it was twilight I went outside and walked around the block for a bit. I encountered a lost little kitty, white and grey and tiny and mewing, soft and brushing against me. I seem to come across cats near the (tail) ends of trips, although it may be just coincidence rather than any symbol, given the high cat population in the westernised world. <br /><br />I then lay down on my driveway and watched the stars. There were some that shone particularly bright. I wondered if it was a satellite or a planet or something else. There were faint black lines superimposed over the sky which seemed to me at first like electricity wires, although I realised it was another visual. My mind was automatically imposing a sense of order on the disorder of the night sky, the stars lighting up in their constellations and rearranging themselves into more pleasing arrangements. <br /><br />I heard the strains the most beautiful guitar music playing somewhere distant, and a male voice singing a song I didn&#039;t recognise, and it took me back to ages past, back when I was in San Francisco, and I felt an immense sense of saudade.<br /><br />&nbsp;I walked up the hill a little way, and then down the hill a little way, trying to pinpoint the location of the music. I walked through the meandering streets of suburbia until I found where I thought was the right location where the music was coming from, and I sat down on the nature strip and listened. <br /><br />The notes died down and people at the unseen party clapped and cheered. I realised I wasn&#039;t at the right house and turned the bend and came to the right house. I knew because the lights were lit up and cars were parked in the driveway. People draped with fake rainbow haiwaiian leis were entering the house. It was a fiftieth birthday party, I was told.<br /><br />&nbsp;I wished I&#039;d been invited, and been able to enjoy the live music and ask what song they were playing before. But I was a stranger there, so I detached myself from the tableau, lit up a menthol cigarette and walked back through the dark lonely streets from whence I came.<br /><br />I started coming down around 9:30am onwards, but it was around 4pm when I finally went to sleep because I was chatting to folks on my phone and reading (I&#039;m too damn good at distracting myself from sleep). I dreamt of San Francisco that night, and then I woke up, opened my laptop, had a cup of joe, and started writing up this trip report for y&#039;all to read. <br /><br />It was an absolutely amazing, serene and tranquil experience that made me see psychedelics (and the nature of mind and spirit) in a fresh new way again. Would highly recommend buying this product. Thank you Peaceful, you live up to your name!

Nor did I say that is what I thought was going on. Rather I used 2c-e as an example of type of trip just t compare what I was experiencing. I actually said:<br /><br />&quot;No way it is Nbomes of sorts as there would be a distinct chemical taste. No way it is a 2c-x as they are required in mg doses.<br /><br />So, we are actually stumped. It is most likely LSD. But just different to what we know&quot;. <br /><br />So yes, it is most likely LSD. But what I am saying is I have had stronger LSD when you are claiming that this is 90% pure. That is my hesitation.<br /><br />And I am also aware that LSD can affect you differently in different situations. Hence why I waited until I had taken yours twice to see if there was a significant change. But the only change came in the fact that the first &quot;bang&quot; was bigger. The rest of the trip mimicked the other. Hence also the comparison I gave. <br /><br />At any rate, you are right there is no point in arguing. And just to clarify, I did not have a bad experience and as I said I am in no way trying to deter customers, I actually said it was quite fun. A good trip. But not quite as pure as I had hoped or as strong. What I was after with this post is for other reviewers other than newbs with 1 post to come and share their experiences. No offense, but when you have a review thread full of accounts with 1 post and this being their first and calling down the gods to say that it is the best acid they have ever taken, it does raise suspicions. <br /><br />*Clearnet Warning*<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_article1.shtml<br /><br />LSD is notoriously hard to test for purity unless you have access to some nice labs. Which I don&#039;t unfortunately. However I would love some confirmation on this LSD and its strength. <br /><br />At any rate, I wait upon the SR community for feedback. <br /><br />Thanks<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />just thought I would add in, I have had some amazing trips off this LSD and most lasting 10+ hours. I did have one trip though which was quite lack luster though which only lasted around 7-8 hours but I do think that was my fault for trying to trip off little sleep and a less than ideal setting. <br />just a cool note to add, I have recently started to micro dose with LSD, 10mics mon/wed/fri, the interesting thing about this is that it has drastically reduced my normal tolerance to LSD.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I had a look in &#039;Tikhal&#039; and Shulgin lists LSD as 8 to 12 hrs duration. In my experience I can usually sleep after about 8 hrs. I haven&#039;t found this acid any different. I get about 8 hrs if I take it in the evening or maybe 10 hrs if I take it earlier in the day.<br />The duration of the trip is also influenced by the way I drop. If I stagger the drop the trip is less intense on the comeup but lasts longer. I had 2 tabs together a couple of nights ago and the comeup was intense but I could sleep after 9 hours. Actually the first few hours of the trip were pretty intense and I was taken a bit by surprise at just how strong it was - knocked me on my back for a couple of hours- I was glad I was on my own and didn&#039;t have to do anything but trip. I peaked for about 4 hours pretty strong and then it was a slow and steady passage downward to the 9th hour. <br />It was really what I would expect a 300ug trip to be like but often claims of strength have been a bit off.<br />It was a pretty similar pattern to all the other LSD that I&#039;ve taken with about 4 hours or so of peaking. I can usually extend it a bit with a bit of weed.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested that you find your tolerance reduced with the microdosing. Any comparisons ie does a single tab feel like 2 or 1 1/2 ?<br />How may weeks did you microdose and what doses did you try after it?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Peaceful! <br />I hope that you are doing well, and that you&#039;re on your way to getting setup in the new marketplaces!<br />I came a bit late to the party, but still wondering if you are in the need of some more set up funds? I had received my order from you the day before SR was shut down! My co-pilot and I were talking about it for ages, thinking about if we had waited one day later to order from you. <br /><br />Regardless, all is well! And from the ashes, we are reborn! Looking forward to finding you back on BMR and SM!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />TRIP REPORT: Peaceful&#039;s LSD; Dosage: ~325ug followed by ~325ug 4 hours later.<br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />My co-pilot and I dropped the tabs at about 1730, on empty stomachs, after having consumed about a liter of water each 45 minutes prior.<br />The come-up was smooth, the tabs tasteless in our mouths, and we could feel the general body high kicking in at about the 35 minute mark.<br />As we started peaking, at about 1hr15m in, elements in our peripheral vision started to pulsate, breath and melt. We decided to watch a very trippy anime called &quot;Cat Soup&quot;, I suggest that you all check it out, it was quite the experience. At about 2hours in, the waves were in full swing, I would stare at the floor, the tiles, the ceiling, and see amazing patterns and moving, snake-skin like surfaces on everything, and the tracers were some of the most amazing things I have ever seen! Waving my hands around, watching my co-pilot dance, it was splendid!<br /><br />As the waves came and came again, we decided to listen to some chillstep, with winamp&#039;s visualizations on the big screen, the music was on a very low volume, yet it seemed like it was flowing right through us, the patterns and colors on the screen bleeding from it, and drifting and being absorbed by everything around it, and I found myself, multiple times, slipping in and out the screen, awash with color and pattern.<br /><br />At about 4 hours in, we decided to drop the other tabs, and at the moment, about 2145, I decided we needed to be outside! We promptly changed to more comfortable, warmer clothes and shoes, and set out on a quest to walk to nowhere.<br /><br />We walked to a lake nearby, and set out on the coast, the water looking amazing as the lights of the city reflected off of it, shooting beams of light back up to the sky, reflecting the stars, and illuminating the heavens with blues, reds and greens. The tiled walkways snaked from under us, making it feel like no matter how many steps we too, we weren&#039;t moving in any direction, just perpetually walking. My body was senseless, and yet all my senses were so heightened. <br /><br />We reached a monument, and laid on our backs staring at the sky, with the monument in our peripherals, and the waves came again, washing over me, asking me to accept this new found perspective as reality. After about a 15 minute flight into the cosmos, getting up and trying to take things in the right way up seemed so alien, but we were off again, walking perpetually, watching the trees breath and bend on this windless night.<br /><br />Colors were brighter, more vivid, music was constantly playing even though there was nothing but the sounds of the city, the stars were brighter than I&#039;ve ever seen them, and the lights of the city were reflected by the silky surface of the murky lake, almost beckoning us to skate across it!<br /><br />We walked and walked, and reached the other side of the lake, stood in an amazing echoing hallways and stomped and clapped, listening to the sound bounce around the hallways, laughing, and watching the tiles slither under our feet.<br /><br />We walked and walked until we followed light beacons home, four hours and 14 kilometers later, we arrived back home, peripherals still buzzing, tracers still flying, body still warm and euphoric.<br /><br />I checked the time sunrise was scheduled for, and we picked the highest mountain overlooking the entire city, and decided that we&#039;d lay down for a few hours, then get up and head up the mountain.<br /><br />Three hours of resting our bodies, but minds still racing, wide awake, watching, searching for things to keep them occupied, catching glimmers and glimpses of light bouncing around the otherwise dark room, the alarm sounded, and we were off again.<br /><br />We followed the track to the top of the mountain, and waited... The sky turned an amazing shade of yellow... then peach... then tangerine, then the sun broke its crown over the hills that seemed so far away. <br />A spectacle to behold as it chased the shade and shadow from the city, the lake below lighting up like a mirror reflecting thousands of individual beams of light. Still buzzing, we sat there, amazed that we hadn&#039;t ever experienced anything like this before.<br /><br />Needless to say, we were happy, and we were there. Watching the sun rise over the city we had traversed only hours before in the blanket of night. Couldn&#039;t help by try and associate the sunrise with a new begin for Peaceful and the magic he weaves!<br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Once again, looking forward to becoming one of your biggest fans, wherever you choose to make your new home!
