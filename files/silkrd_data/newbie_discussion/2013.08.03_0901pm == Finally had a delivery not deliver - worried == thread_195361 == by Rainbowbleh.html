				So I&#039;ve been ordering on SR for about 8 months now.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had over 25 shipments in that time.&nbsp; All domestic.&nbsp; Never once has an order not made it to me.&nbsp; Or even arrived more than a day later than I expected it.&nbsp; But my latest order was shipped over a week ago.. last Friday. Shipment was sent via Priority Mail.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never used the vendor before, but they have an excellent rating.&nbsp; And according to my friend who orders from them all the time, they have excellent stealth.. constantly changing things about the package and he&#039;s never had an issue.&nbsp; He also converses with the guy and he seems like a stand up guy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve messaged him, and all he can do is confirm that it shipped to the correct zip code.&nbsp; The one thing that I was maybe stupid about, is I placed 3 orders around the same time.. all pending at the same time.&nbsp; Which I never do.&nbsp; I rarely order more than every week or 2.&nbsp; They were all from different vendors and for different products.&nbsp; But 2 of the orders made it no problem and within a day or 2.&nbsp; Then nothing in the mail for a week now.&nbsp; Luckily the order was one of the smallest orders I&#039;ve ever made.. and would definitely be considered a personal amount.<br />-Should I be worried<br />-Did it likely get lost are am I legitimate in my concern that it may be intercepted?<br />-Is there anything I or the vendor can do to check on it before I am able to go into resolution?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had many sleepless nights and having to wait so long to resolve before I can even get a hint at what has happened is kinda driving me bonkers ha<br />-Anyone have similar experiences? How did it turn out?<br /><br />Thanks for your time!

				The vendor should have the tracking number, unless they&#039;re an idiot.<br /><br />If they check the tracking label from a remote location, and it was seized, the Track will have stopped, with either &quot;forwarded&quot; or a simple &quot;Processed through sort&quot; being the last updates in the system.<br /><br />... some times things DO get lost in the mail, but it&#039;s more likely that the vendor is yanking your chain if they can&#039;t tell you what&#039;s up. <br /><br />Good luck with that my friend, and definitely do NOT Finalize.

				Cool ya I wasn&#039;t sure if they kept the tracking, or if they submit it to SR and burn it or something.&nbsp; Is there a security risk for why they may not want to provide an update?&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard vendors generally won&#039;t give out tracking for security reasons, but I would think a simple &quot;Oh, yeah, it looks like it got lost, or seized&quot; or something shouldn&#039;t be an issue.&nbsp; Just not sure what general practice here is.

				If you get a simple letter in the mail saying you had something confiscated, how long does that typically take?&nbsp; And if cops were to actually knock on the door, I assume that would have already happened by now?

				Thanks for your help.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m good.&nbsp; Heard from the vendor and it sounds like they accidentally sent it to the wrong address... wrong state entirely.&nbsp; So I should be in the clear.&nbsp; We&#039;re working out how to fix it now.
