				What&#039;s the best storage method for weed? I was reading about using Kerr/Ball jars, that seems like a good idea. Would it be a good idea to vacuum seal them as well? Maybe with a nitrogen flush first? Just want to keep my personal bud supply dank as possible as long as possible. In order to avoid droughts I&#039;d like to keep a few oz on hand stored various places.

				I use Kerr jars, definitely a good option. My weed always stays fresh in those things, picked up like a 12 pack of them at the grocery store for like $10.

				Definitely a Ball jar. Strong, air tight, smell proof, and will keep your weed for months. I&#039;ve also heard puting it in the freezer as well can help (although it probably isn&#039;t necessary unless you want to keep it for over a year). I&#039;ve kept weed for months in a Ball jar and its been totally dank still.&nbsp;

				Ok thanks, I&#039;m using the Mason jar. It works great. How the weed can still smell through the jar lid is amazing. I saw these neat like quart size jars but they were short, like 4&quot; high, but wide mouth, pperrrrffecctt for those large buds.

				To keep your stash completely dry, no matter what the outside humidity is, buy some calcium chloride and pour a small amount into a paper towel. Tie it into a ball and put it in a airtight container with the weed. It will suck all moisture and never again will you be stock on a rainy camping trip with damp weed.

				Just use glass jars. I keep all the best bud I sell on the road (look at the images on my vendor page) in glass jars.<br />It contains the smell/flavor the best, and also continues the curing process. If you want a less subjective answer, <br />it may be interesting for you to research how cannabis cup winning bud is cured/grown. Hint: soil, organic, glass jars and cured for months.<br /><br />

				I store mine in old prescription bottles with twist-on caps, but I really only handle small amounts. They seem to work well enough for me but I imagine if you have a substantial amount you&#039;ll want to try something else.

				I just ordered some of the cvaults (google them). They&#039;re fairly expensive, but keep your weed at the perfect state. They have little humidity packs on the inside to keep the weed from getting too dry or moldy. Different sizes although I&#039;d recommend getting one of the larger sizes as the large I ordered only fit about an ounce.

				Some considerations about your storage. <br />It should be:<br /><br />1.) airtight - not just for prevention of smell leaking out, but also because it somewhat reduces the chance of your weed getting wet (by accident or through humidity).<br />2.) lightproof - light falling on your weed will degrade the THC to produce other cannabinoids with less &quot;high&quot; (though useful for some medicinal purposes).<br />3.) cool - if you want to cure, you might want it at room temperature, but generally, storing should be done in a cool environment. The freezer is too cold (and ice forming will make your weed soggy after you thaw). A basement or windowless room is the ideal temp. A fridge might be good too, but even here you run the chance of moisture building up when you remove the container. When in doubt, just keep it in a cupboard at room temperature, because the most important thing is -<br />4.) moisture free! - Moisture will make your weed soggy and help bacteria and fungus to grow, which will ruin your stash! This means you should never put an orange peel or other moist crap with your weed like some people here say. you can use these little silica packets that are shipped with some PC hardware or food to soak up air humidity inside your jar, but a bottom filling of uncooked, dry RICE will work just as well. use a few centimeters of rice in the bottom and put a layer of kitchen towel/paper tissue between it and your weed to catch small parts falling off when handling.<br /><br />I have been using either old food tins with a screw cap, or glass mason jars with proper rubber lip for sealing, with a generous bottom layer of rice. Always choose a dark place to put your container.<br /><br />Doing this, I have successfully stored my own produce for over 2 years at room temperature without any difficulties or degradation

				You could buy some cheap MBB&#039;s (Moisture Barrier Bag&#039;s) and seal it with a hair iron thing. Great for shipping as well!
