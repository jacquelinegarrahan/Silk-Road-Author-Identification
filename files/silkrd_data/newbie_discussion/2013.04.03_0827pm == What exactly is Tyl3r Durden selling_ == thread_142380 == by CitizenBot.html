				I&#039;m interested in his blotters but I am a complete newb when it comes to any drug BUT cannabis. Are the blotters on his page worth it? How do they compare to LSD? Any dangers of using these blotters? Tell me all the info you know about them and Tyl3r Durden. Thanks!<br /><br />Tyl3r Durden&#039;s selling page:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b8da404fa1

				All the things he is selling (such as 25I-NBOMe) are derivatives of the 2C class of synthetic psychedelics. Google them.

				He&#039;s selling 25I-NBOMe, which is a psychedelic drug derived from 2C-I. The blotters he sells are of a relatively strong dosage. 25I can be compared to LSD with regards to its effects, but since it was discovered in 2003, research on it is very new and potentially incomplete.<br /><br />Here is the Erowid page: https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/<br /><br />Be careful with this one, as less is known about it than what would be preferred.

				Thanks so much for the replies! Could you recommend a safer, beginner dose LSD?

				Beginner does LSD is about 100 micrograms. After taking one tab wait for the effects to kick in, do not take another one for at least 5 hours otherwise you&#039;ll end up very confused altogether. Many people wait 30-60 mins, feel no effect then redose only to find out that 10 mins later they&#039;re tripping balls and know that they&#039;re gonna get a LOT more twisted once the second hit kicks in.<br /><br />25i NBOMe&nbsp; couldn;t tell you much about other than its very new and untested. It is however incredibly potent, your best bet is to read up on trip reports on erowid.<br />I plan on ordering a sheet of them soon just to check them out.<br />:) Happy tripping.<br />

				With lsd you can push the amount you take a lot its a fairly safe chem and high dosage will definitely get you high up on the shulgin scale. I wouldn&#039;t do the same with 25i nbome. There really strong and more than 1 can even be pushing it.

				related but as a sidenote, I&#039;ve received a few international orders from Tyler in a very short time.&nbsp; Very impressed with this vendor, very trustworthy.<br /><br />Definitely recommend starting with a small dose, and working up from there, you can always do more, you can&#039;t do less. Be careful though it does take between 1.5-2 hours to take full effect. I&#039;d recommend trying the 25C (blue caps) first if you arent experienced with psychedelics, the 25i can be pretty intense for a first timer!

				He is selling NBOME&#039;s. They are fun, however, less intense than LSD. My first time, I took 1.6mg of 25C and it was awesome, tons of visuals and amazing music, lasted around 8 hours. The second time 1.6mg of 25C and 1.6mg of 25I, I tripped pretty hard, but all the while was able to safely drive home, it lasted around the same time although I dosed the I about an hour before the C. Anyway, it&#039;s all fun stuff and would definitely recommend. LSD &gt; Nbome imo, but every chemical has intrinsic value and can make you smile.
