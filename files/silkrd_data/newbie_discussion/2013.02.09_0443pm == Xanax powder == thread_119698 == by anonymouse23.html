				Yeah, you definitely want to get an accurate scale. And he just meant to dissolve the xanax powder into a liquid and measure as a mg/mL solution but I think the scale would be easier for you. For $50 you can get a fairly accurate one to the .01 like I use to weigh heroin. It won&#039;t be perfect but would prevent overdose.

				I would suggest mixing it with PG Propylene glycol easily found online.&nbsp; I would dump the whole gram bag into 1000ml or if sold in ounces 32oz (946ml).&nbsp; That would give you about 1mg/ml dosage.&nbsp; I would try to find something you could put the solution on if you were going to sell it.<br /><br />No cheapo scale on amazon is going to give you accurate measurememts.&nbsp; Especially if you are going to sell this you don&#039;t want to risk giving someone to much.&nbsp; If they end up in the hospital and rat you out that is your life.

				Volumetric dosing. &amp; wou have a couple of easy options actually &amp; I&#039;ve done this with etizolam powder.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get some propylene glycol, you can order it online. Get 100% food grade.&nbsp; I got a 1L bottle for like $20 when all was said and done.&nbsp; I found it on Amazon of all places.&nbsp; Alprazolam, as with most benzos except I believe midazolam are not very soluable, if at all, in water.&nbsp; Though I&#039;ve heard people dissolving xanax in boiling water for injection.&nbsp; But storing it that way the xanax would likely precipitate out after a short while.&nbsp; Most benzos are however, soluable in propylene glycol, chlorophorm (tougher to get) and ethanol or isopropynol. The safest and best method I believe is propylene glycol.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had 250mg of etizolam powder and I went to the pharmacy and asked for an empty 100ml cough medicine bottle (they just gave it to me.&nbsp; If they ask why, tell them you make herbal tinctures or something.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you could buy those bottles online as well). I put the etiz powder in the bottle, filled it up with 100% PG, sealed the bottle, and ran it under hot water to speed up dissolving the etiz (and of course, shook occasionally).&nbsp; Total process took about 10 minutes tops, and I had etizolam suspension with 2.5mg per ml.&nbsp; I also got one of those 3ml measuring syringes (like the ones you use to give medicine to babies or pets). With a gram of xanax, that may be more difficult and you&#039;d almost certainly need to use much much more PG.&nbsp; I would suggest getting a mg scale online (you can get one for $30) and weighing out 250mg amounts, and using volumetric dosing using 100ml increments to ensure the alprazolam dissolves fully.&nbsp; You can always add more PG later if need be, but you will of course be constrained by the size of the bottle you plan on storing it in.&nbsp; &nbsp;But a 2.5mg per ml solution would be perfect I think. <br /><br />You could also do something similar with isopropynol or ethanol.&nbsp; How I would do that, is I would dissolve a weighed amount (see where I&#039;m going with this) in a small amount of either alcohols (preferably ethanol as its safer), and use blotter, or something similar (heavy paper towel would likely work) and dip it in the ethanol/alprazolam solution, then allow it to evaporate (the alcohol that is).&nbsp; The only problem with this, is the dosing won&#039;t be anywhere near as accurate, and frankly its a more timely and difficult process. But it is an option.&nbsp; <br /><br />But if you plan on playing with powders which are active in micrograms, and can black you out for days with an amount that could get stuck to your finger, I&#039;d say get a milligram scale.&nbsp; They&#039;re great to have around if you&#039;re dealing with RC&#039;s or really any super potent drugs.&nbsp; Get one that weighs to at least .001 of course.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope that helps.&nbsp;

				I didn&#039;t even realize ign0ramus had suggested PG.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s the best way to go for storage and dosing honestly. Worked great with etizolam, and a 1000ml bottle of PG would likely dissolve the whole gram. You could probably get away with 500ml to be honest.

				Yeah I would go with 500ml (16oz) so you won&#039;t have so much solution.&nbsp; I would go lower but I&#039;m not sure what the maximum concentration of alp propylene glycol can hold.

				Yep, I definitely agree with ignoramus.&nbsp; Less than 500ml may not dissolve all the alprazolam.&nbsp; Plus, at 500lm you&#039;d have 2mg/ml which I&#039;m sure you know is a bar, so that would be perfect. If you&#039;re planning on selling it though, I would certainly invest in some empty medicine bottles and a bunch of measuring syringes to ensure the people buying it are dosing properly, and sell them together (you can even get the 1ml syringes for cheap by the box of 100).&nbsp; With high doses of xanax its easy to get out of control and end up blacked out or in jail as I&#039;m sure you know. If someone buys a bottle and thinks they can just sip on it, there&#039;s a huge potential for problems there.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason me and my buddies used to call xanax prison bars. Shit, even with myself properly measuring out the doses of etizolam I still lost nearly an entire weekend. But thats just me, I can&#039;t be trusted with hundreds or thousands of doses of any benzo...I end up trying to eat em all.

				You could also probably mix it with some type of filler, e.g. lactose, and then weigh it out (check that the filler is suitable first however). The key would be to get sufficient mixing but I am not sure what the +/- would be on final xanax weight. Something like 9 grams lactose to 1 gram xanax and then weigh out 10mg (1 mg xanax: 9mg lactose) lots.<br /><br />Either way you have to be very careful as even 10 mg is very difficult to measure with even the most precise and accurate lab scales. I am not sure how well it would hold up in solution but maybe someone else can answer that?
