				For most buys on SR (less than 200$ upto 1000$) are very small personal use quantities<br /><br />LE and customs will not strain their very llimited resources on individual buyers..they simply are overstreched with less resources to follow small users<br /><br />they after big fish catches which will atleast make a headline on page 3 next to a cracked up hooker stabbed news on grade B newspapers...lol<br /><br />only committed stupids using same address on multiple shipments getting caught get their attention<br /><br />they not gonna charge you for 100$ buy on SR and take it to court with 50000$ wasting public money on court man-hours and investigative costs<br /><br />and you post 50$ bail...grow up<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ignorance is bliss it seems...... <br /><br />The police will charge an individual user, they will raid simple end users homes and they will go above and beyond to make your life difficult if they believe there is anything of value they can get out of you, information or whatever.... They will lie, manipulate and not think twice about what impact it will have on you and from my experience they are not caught up on silly things like &#039;natural justice&#039; or that other annoyance to them &#039;truth&#039; every arrest gives them more goodness for their stats; more drugs seized, more property stolen, er forfeited, and convictions are just the icing. They have no real interest in touching the real big boys and so focus on the mid range and end users with exceptions made for the lower big boys who get over confident or whatever. Forces their hands you see.<br /><br />OP; I have had ALOT of seizures for everything from stun guns and bb&#039;s through to a $3 lighter. (on the lighter... anyone wants a laugh go read what justification Australian customs need to take a lighter! nothing to do with safety clips or what you would expect) I even had several items make it through after the multiple love letters I received over the time. I hadn&#039;t been flagged, my address hadn&#039;t been flagged and when the drug pigs raided me (simple end user right here BTW) they had absolutely no idea until they found the one letter that had escaped the shredder. Even after the raids (drug related despite full knowledge of my &#039;user&#039; status) I had 2 old orders arrive over the next month.... I think you would find it an impossible thing to flag normal unregistered mail... Tracked on the other hand.... Oh an interesting thing is that of the packages seized it was only the registered mail types that got picked up but again it was not EVERY registered package I ordered that got got and even after the love letters it seemed to be a random thing. that was all about a year ago now... Perhaps a G of coke would get a little more in terms of preliminary investigations but can you imagine if they went after even half the small intercepts? heh on their figures of seized things it would be half a billion each day ;-P but maybe if there was 10 identical packages going to the same end location it may get the extra attention of them..<br /><br />Nothing in life is certain and whats true today may or may not be tomorrow so its worth remembering that its an illegal activity and alot of these LE types actually believe the bullshit and actually think they are making peoples lives better by being the oinkers they are. drugs are bad and anyone involved in any part of them are criminals and less of a human and are single handedly destroying the Ozone layer, the polar ice caps, tearing the very fabric of society and are the spawn of demons...

				for registered or courier mail (ems) there is a&nbsp; data log and address is marked<br />i had a mate who got a love letter for 100 odd grams of bzp/tmf and they informed him his address was marked<br />funny thing is they identified the tmf but said that the other substance they could not identify and if he could provide documents for it<br />he could have it back....or it would be destroyed in 30 days ......leading him to believe that there is a gram limit that must get a reaction from customs ......and he crossed it but they are so over worked that they said they did not know what it was so they didn&#039;t have to do anything about it........ rc chems seem to get a low response from customs <br />another mate never received an order for 5 grams of 25i no letter no nothing ........this seems to happen a bit<br />they focus hard on class A drugs<br />coke<br />mdma<br />weed<br />ice <br />heroin<br />as they are easier to prosecute rc chems are still a greyish area for the law

				Iv been thinking about this. I requested a reship after a no show to the only other address I can trust an again I gt a no show. Neither address received a &#039;love letter&#039; but im quite reluctant to order again. The order was about $230 40 xtc pills from holland to the uk. Have I been screwed? Rather than hassle an international drug dealer Iv just given up and told him to keep the money but im more annoyed Im under the impression that I dont have any adresses to get my shit sent to. Not going to lie its ruined my whole sr experience after having plenty of packages arrive. Do the uk customs send out letters? I had one several years ago but im led to believe its normal not to receive one for 40 210mg xtc tablets?

Duh. Lol. Yea I suppose id like to think he thinks hes reducing the chances of you reoffending by saying that. I wouldnt imagine hed have any plans to come back but you will have gone on a list sumwhere that your a drug user with the police but I wouldnt imagine theyd spend any extra time looking at your mail. I like to imagine government are as effective at catching us as they are at running the country which is very poor. Still id hate to lul you into a false sense if security. Maybe for a while dont open your packages immediately? Write return to sender on the envelope (if it doesnt have a return address slap one on) and leave it in the hallway whilst you nip to the shop. Even in a controlled delivery youd be apprehended the second you looked like you were going out to sell what youd taken delivery of. If they are watching and you get raided at lwast your lawyer will have something to play with

				I was thinking some more about this and what should have been obvious has finally hit me.. None of my intercepts have ever been for anything more than &#039;toys&#039; ;-) I guess class A drugs will be a different outcome... <br /><br />I&#039;ve been avoiding coming on here to the forums for a while again cause every time I do I walk away feeling really uneasy about so much stuff!! Now I can&#039;t reply to threads that I had before but can on this one which is fucking my head no end... So many stories about LE taking over here and user names being posted etc has left me numb and in shock.. then the one with the pin number request to a long time and seemingly respected vendor and forum member and their coins all going has me just going bananas.. killing me I can&#039;t reply cause from the way it looks that was a very sophisticated injection hack that resulted in the person thinking they where adding a second pin but if you look at the url it seems that they had been tricked onto the make your pin, as in the ONLY pin you have, and so the person thinking &#039;ha I know I&#039;ll post some bullshit pin and all will be ok.. oops they actually just changed their old pin and gave it to who ever!!! <br /><br />All this and the total exodus of Australian vendors has me worried.. too many 1 in a hundred chances all add together to a 1 in 1 chance something has/is going down.. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=111330.0<br /><br />that&#039;s the one about the coins thing.. I gotta say after reading what was a very well written and appropriate thread about free speech and watching people turn to total cunts on the OP despite this OP trying to remain civil and being extremely restrained and posting well thought out and logical (albeit perhaps a little too intellectual and perhaps abstract for some to ever grasp) in their retorts to petulant, ignorant and frustrating attacks from people that I would bet are still in their teens and have less life experience that some of the jeans and shoes I own I&#039;m really disgusted... Frankly this is my third account here on the forums and will, if I bother staying on here, do many many more (like a burn phone, a drop address and so on how safe do you really think it is having an account for many years posting many many little crumbs to follow?) On this I want to say too that it seems to me that there is really only a handful of&nbsp; &#039;100+ posts&#039; users and some of the originals seem to have any idea about most of the things that the rest of the 100+ post users have so much to say on.. I could be a troll and post on every thread with useless pandering or parroting but at the end of it all the people who I would value liking my posts won&#039;t be judging (pre Judging more accurately) my post from my post count but rather the content of my posts... like how the people in real life I care about could give a fuck about how I look and value me for my id if you please.<br /><br />This is whats really pisses me off more than anything... I&#039;m driven these rants and always hit this point and think &#039;sheesh... another rant.. sigh walk away, come back and read it like its from someone else and either post or turn the PC off&#039; I&#039;m not a nut but this fucking forum makes me like this and just gets under my skin the mess that people are making of the best chance we all have to actual change inside our lifetimes.. Just living down to the low expectations of the LE, polies and indoctrinated and giving them ammo to use against us.. I haven&#039;t spent 20+ years of my life walking the tight rope between being considered reputable and intelligent amongst the people I interact with on a daily basis and not just a drug user attempting to justify my immoral ways while not being one of those that condemns drugs in public and uses in private to watch trolls and children get away with shooting from the hip on things they have little to no concept on (the worst of the worst IMO and a shameful place to be.. cowardly and you should have the courage of your convictions and have the self respect to actually want to learn about things you know deep down you have no understanding of rather than lying to yourself and talking crap....) It has meant that ANYTHING I say about prohibition has had to be factual and robust less I get discounted and shunned... Basically it has meant so much reading and journal research combined with actually thinking about the exact sentence structure and even the words I use (slang for example can discredit you in a heartbeat in some of the top level circles I have been in, around or discussed) so that I can maybe, just maybe convince or plant the seed in one persons mind that maybe there is something not right ....<br /><br />ended up walking away half way though that sentence cause I even started to question my soberness and objectivity and after reflection I have decided that given the recent policy changes it is clear that unless I&#039;m prepared to play the post numbers game my opinions are invalid and have no worth and so by extension I cannot offer help or advice to people of any value. Given this and my general contempt toward these types of artificial hierarchies and variable based discrimination not unlike so many of the government and social ones that are used to censor the truth IRL&nbsp; I have decided I don&#039;t give a shit any more.. Its costing too much in time that could be used to further the movement in other areas and has become clear that on here its a loosing battle and not productive anymore so feel that its time to delete this account and get on with living my life IRL and doing the good where I can out there. Hey maybe if someone who has any real vision that extends further than the OS order they are waiting on&nbsp; and keeping the status quot comes in a guides the powers that be (such as they are) towards that better world, read forum, that we all want I might be back.. but here is the kicker.. you will never know as it will a new name again.. by then though my character and the content of my knowledge will be worth more than a post count....<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You Australians have a lucrative drug market indeed, all it would take is enough urging of your compatriots for vendors to step up their stealth methods from Australian orders, make them pay more for special stealth whatever, but abandoning the market entirely is a poor business decision on the vendors&#039; part. One, a few at least will not be able to set aside.
