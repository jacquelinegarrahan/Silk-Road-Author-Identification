				For some reason this is the only section of the forums I can start a new thread, or reply to existing threads even.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been on in a while but every other section of the forum doesn&#039;t permit me to post at all.&nbsp; Please help.

				Ok, I get it now.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t understand at first since all of my post were in now restricted areas.&nbsp; I do not mind this at all and will go about it the way that keeps this site and it members and leaders safe and blocks spammers/scammers and any other asshole who wishes to screw this place up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m glad steps have been taken to cut some of that annoying shit out.
