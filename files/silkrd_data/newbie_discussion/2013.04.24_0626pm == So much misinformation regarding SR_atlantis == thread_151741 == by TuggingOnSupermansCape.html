				I appreciate loyalty, i really do, but some of you have absolutely no clue what you&#039;re talking about when declaring SR better than Atlantis. Here, allow me to put my BS in Cyber Security to use for you.<br /><br />Silk Road:<br />Severely outdated code, that is both insecure and inefficient. It is filled with open loops, inline styling, and code snippets that haven&#039;t been used since 1999. It has so much errant and extra code within the pages themselves, that it accounts for 26% of the page load time alone. It is written in php 4 (which was phased out in 2009), and is vulnerable to multiple site hacks to including the php-cgi hack, and the null byte attack (which is what is currently happening). It&#039;s &#039;code&#039; is extremely amateurish, and appears to be a hodgepodge of several different premade scripts. <br /><br />Atlantis:<br />Written in bootstrap (html 5/css3) with a lamp backend (php 5+). i wont discuss the benefits bootstrap offers, because they&#039;re too numerous. Let&#039;s just state it&#039;s pretty much the most efficient coding template available, google will tell you specifics. It has a team of professional developers. It is stable and secure, and every single bit of information sent is hashed, then hashed again. No plain text vulnerability here (cough, SR). <br /><br />Even if every single SR user logged onto atlantis and started doing business at the same time, you would NEVER face the instability issues that SR has.<br /><br />Now i&#039;m not saying that one is better than the other from a consumer standpoint, as its obvious SR currently has more to offer, however i had to clarify the technicalities of the site, because i&#039;ve seen some really idiotic comments here from people who simply have no idea what they&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />There&#039;s many more differences that can be pointed out, however i wanted to concentrate on the website aspect alone (to avoid any personal feelings, opinions, or conjecture being used).<br /><br />tldr: Atlantis is, and always will be (as long as SR stays on it&#039;s current platform) more technically advanced, stable, and secure. You&#039;re only fooling yourself if you believe otherwise.

I&#039;m a casual user here maybe ~20btc total, and i only purchase the occasional bud. I do, however, have orders placed from last Friday and Saturday, that the vendor can&#039;t even login to send. That is unacceptable.<br /><br />2. There is no DDOS going on. If there was, they wouldnt be able to set a maintenance message the last 2 days. The site was prone to a null byte hack, which is why the site is totally down (requires DB changes/upgrades to prevent as well as a code update). Are you familiar with DDOS over TOR? Here let me quote you some official info from the TOR project so you can be more informed.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks typically rely on having a group of thousands of computers all sending floods of traffic to a victim. Since the goal is to overpower the bandwidth of the victim, they typically send UDP packets since those don&#039;t require handshakes or coordination.<br /><br />But because Tor only transports correctly formed TCP streams, not all IP packets, you cannot send UDP packets over Tor. (You can&#039;t do specialized forms of this attack like SYN flooding either.) So ordinary DDoS attacks are not possible over Tor. Tor also doesn&#039;t allow bandwidth amplification attacks against external sites: you need to send in a byte for every byte that the Tor network will send to your destination.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />3. Why are you so hostile towards competition? It only forces those not performing up to their rivals to get their ass in gear. It&#039;s a good thing, and necessary for a healthy market.

				I love the UI of Atlantis, so sleek and easy to use; not to mention fast as shit. Despite all that though, I&#039;ll stick to the tried and tested SR until Atlantis has really been through the ropes- hell, maybe not even then. The amount of established vendors on SR is enough for me.

				Nobody knows anything about the guys behind Atlantis or what happens on the backend. With Silk Road at least its known the DEA have been looking for DPR for years without luck. They could find the atlantis servers, creators within months and these guys being kids for all we know could easily roll over and taking down all the buyers / sellers on their site at the same time. For me I&#039;ll check it out in 6months to a year if its still around, stay safe this is not EBAY

				I agree, all this Atlantis hype when SR is under attack is highly suspicious..... If you want to praise Atlantis go do it on their forums..... oh wait, they probably don&#039;t have one. <br /><br />I don&#039;t give 2 shits and a fuck about Atlantis.... even if SR only works for 5 minutes a day,&nbsp; I&#039;ll continue to support it over the competition.<br /><br />If I was DPR I&#039;d delete every forum member hyping Atlantis, along with any SR account that has matching username. I&#039;d also lock new user registration on the forums for a few weeks as well.<br /><br />This is the SR forum, you should only be aloud to talk about SR.

				I was going to try Atlantis for myself, but after they spammed this forum to get started, and have started running some kind of passive advertising campaign now that the site is under attack, I don&#039;t trust them at all. <br /><br />As someone who switched from one of those Cyber Security/Ethical Hacking BSc courses to Computer Science BSc, I would strongly question your ability to perform a security assessment on this site.

People can only put up with so much downtime. Downtime is money. It&#039;s sales vendors are not making.

				I appreciate your response. However, i just want to clear up one thing. I didn&#039;t do this as an Atlantis promotion, SR demotion thread. I know it certainly reads that way, but that&#039;s only because the facts steer it towards that. I wanted to make sure people actually knew that their information is no safer on SR, and is probably much less safe in all actuality, than another site in the industry. <br /><br />You&#039;re absolutely correct about people though. Humans as a whole have become a much more closed minded species since digital media has become more prevalent in our lives. Questions used to be good, and breed innovation. Nowadays questions bring attacks, accusations of disloyalty, and libelous statements. One day we&#039;ll wake up.

				These morons don&#039;t even know what DoS means. It&#039;s a term used to describe any attack that results in a denial of service to users. In other words, if it results in the website going down, it&#039;s a DoS attack of some form. They&#039;re only trying to claim it&#039;s not a DoS attack so they can then suggest that DPR is either technically inept or dishonest. It&#039;s just their way of trying to make the community lose faith in this site and its administrators. <br /><br />The other point of interest is that the members on this forum who are claiming that Silk Road is vulnerable and unsafe compared to Atlantis also claim to be customers on Silk Road. Every time I have found what I consider to be a better alternative to a site I use, I just go there and use it, and I don&#039;t start preaching about it. <br /><br />I remember first hearing about Atlantis when this forum was briefly hit by spammers advertising it. That alone looked a bit shady, but now they&#039;ve really exposed themselves. Whether it&#039;s members of the community doing this or the admins, I don&#039;t want anything to do with them.

				For the record, I have no affiliation to Atlantis (haven&#039;t even visited it) but I will pick up a couple of superman&#039;s / Eleusinian&#039;s points:<br /><br />- If SR is really still using PHP 4 then that would be pretty shocking. PHP 4 hasn&#039;t received any security updates since 2008.<br /><br />- PHP-CGI is an old PHP handler, security can be improved with SUPHP although it&#039;s very slow compared with modern FastCGI.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite easy to DOS CGI by forcing it to spawn processes until it dies on it&#039;s arse.<br /><br />- &quot;Bootstrapping as in tunneling all traffic through a single php file?&quot; No, bootstrap is a modern, clean, CSS3 framework used by Twitter etc.&nbsp; Security doesn&#039;t really come in to it but it does indicate modern standards compliant web development.<br /><br />- One way hash functions are standard on all modern CMSes for obscuring passwords stored in a database.&nbsp; No one in their right mind stores plaintext passwords.&nbsp; Even MD5 hashes are pretty insecure these days, there are plenty of sites where you can break them in a few seconds (still better than plaintext though).&nbsp; Salting helps though, or using stronger algos.&nbsp; It has nothing whatsoever to do with a one time pad which is something completely different ( and very secure as Eleusinian implies).<br /><br />The earlier point about TOR not routing UDP sounds legit (really), this doesn&#039;t feel like a DDOS, it feels like a lack of resources.<br /><br />Just my 2p<br />

				Well although initially I was neutral in regard to Atlantis, I now am very sick of seeing people claiming to be them spamming the shit out of this forum. I don&#039;t jump to conclusions, it is quite possible that the feds are trying to turn us against each other by framing Atlantis, in an attempt to cause general discord. However, if this is the case, they have succeeded in my case, as I start to really think Atlantis is likely a scam, provided they are truly responsible for the DDoS and the massive spamming of their site here. It is really admirable that DPR even allowed them to post links to their site here a few times, he honestly does not strike me as a ruthlessly competitive person. Hell, he even gave OVDB an entire sub forum here for a while. But the Atlantis supporters are really wearing out their welcome imo, because we do not need to see in a hundred different threads information about their shit. That is spamming. People who spam tend to be scammers it seems to me. I wonder if they are going to run away with the escrow?<br /><br />As far as the code of SR, why don&#039;t you post some of it since you know it is so shitty? Oh, you cannot post it because PHP is fucking server side code you retard. Did you hack into the SR server and do a security audit on their code? All you can see is the HTML that it outputs. The same goes for Atlantis. You cannot see their code unless you have access to their server. Additionally, it doesn&#039;t really matter a whole whole lot how secure the rendezvous server between vendors and customers is. As always, security is up to those who want it, it can not possibly be outsourced in a secure fashion, especially not outsourced to anonymous characters doing illegal things on the onion net. Admittedly, Atlantis has a few innovative features, I like the idea of automatic GPG encryption of messages to the vendors key, provided the messages are not encrypted already. That is admittedly a bit more secure than what SR is doing, however it would be utterly foolish to rely on it, and as always, security should be managed by the people who need it, not outsourced to potentially malicious third parties. <br /><br />As far as DDoS being impossible over Tor, this has already been covered extensively in some of the other threads these idiots have been making. DDoS over Tor is possible. If you don&#039;t believe me you could ask the Tor developers, but OZfreelancer already did and posted their response saying that DDoS is possible. Not only is it possible in the specific way that they mentioned, which is HS specific, but they are also weak to an assortment of traditional DoS and DDoS attacks. So the people claiming that DDoS over Tor is not possible are talking out of their asses, most certainly.<br /><br />They have either penetrated SR and Atlantis to get copies of the code, or they are lying about having compared the quality.<br />They are overstating the importance of having a secure server, as far as vendors and customers should be concerned.<br />They are lying about the ability to carry out DDoS attacks over Tor. <br />They are spamming this forum with Atlantis bullshit that everybody is sick of hearing, despite DPR being kind enough to allow them to do it ever at all<br /><br />So either they are affiliated with Atlantis, and Atlantis should never be trusted, or they are not affiliated with Atlantis and are trying to cause a problem between the established community and the emerging community, which is a technique that would indeed be utilized by the feds, or could even be bored trolls.

I think that is good. But I think that this Atlantis spam has gotten beyond annoying. Make a single thread about it and shut the fuck up everywhere else already. Nobody really cares about Atlantis.<br /><br />PS: If Atlantis is so much more leet at security than SR&nbsp; , why did I have to tell them to disable hotlinked images on their forum 0_0.

I don&#039;t jump to conclusions, it is quite possible that the feds are trying to turn us against each other by framing Atlantis, in an attempt to cause general discord. However, if this is the case, they have succeeded in my case, as I start to really think Atlantis is likely a scam, provided they are truly responsible for the DDoS and the massive spamming of their site here....0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />This. If you want my two cents, and this is not from a programmer, or developer, or hacker, or anything really, but I feel like TOR services are slower than clearweb anyway, so why have all that extra jazzy graphics for a TOR service? What I look for is functionality. The good looking marketing stuff is to attract masses, and I think SR users, or TOR users that are looking to buy stuff with bitcoin are above visual marketing gimmicks. I could be wrong, but that&#039;s just the way I see it. Give me a Windows 3.1 service that gets the job done or a flashy Windows 7/MacOSX display that&#039;s just showy and slow and doesn&#039;t quite do the job, or is not as intuitive, and I&#039;ll take the Windows 3.1 looking service any day. What&#039;s the use of all those flashy colors? Plain old black and white (or green and white) works great for me.

Indeed most buyers and vendors would prefer to see more competition to drive prices down, but more importantly to increase the diversification of the darknet economy.<br /><br />My problem with Atlantis is mainly down to the fact they are acting weird, specifically obfuscating the difference between clientside and serverside PGP encryption. This is very bad in Pine&#039;s book, and you know why. It does not prove that they are a DEA honeypot but it does make them look suspicious, so you can hardly blame people for jumping to conclusions.<br /><br />You cannot accuse SRians of being sheep. Although some of it may be naive tribalism, look at how former OVDB was welcomed by SR, and more importantly, how there is almost no rancor with discussing backopy&#039;s BlackMarketReloaded, a direct competitor to SR. Atlantis is being picked on specifically because of its marketing approach and what some would call its proponents abrasive manner (not to mention the DOS attack started immediately after a sharp rise in people or sockpuppets talking about Atlantis). The Atlantis people came out and said it was not them, which is accepted and appreciated by me. The timing was highly unfortunate though.<br /><br />If the Atlantis admins want to advertise on SRF, I don&#039;t think DPR has a problem with that. Just show the correct nyms and talk plainly instead of this apparent astroturfing we saw a few days ago. Whether it&#039;s true that&#039;s what it was or not, it makes Atlantis look unethical. You Atlantis supporters do not want to give the impression of an American electoral campaign I should hope. Like kmfkewm says, it just comes across as unprofessional spam. Just imagine SRians return the favor and spam your discussion board (oh wait...). I think we understand each other. Surely we&#039;re better than that.<br /><br />FWIW, I think there are a number of important areas where darknet marketplaces can cooperate to great affect. Namely vendor insurance, backup strategies, vendor information sharing, security information sharing and so on. We should be all aiming towards a darknet confederacy.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151741.msg1075681#msg1075681">Quote from: TuggingOnSupermansCape on May 01, 2013, 05:31 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">p.s. why is no one freaking out about tormail being a honeypot?It was the only other tor site to go down with the &#039;attacks&#039;.

You&#039;re right though, that Tormail is unavailable at the same time as this attack on SR is suspicious. Although they may be unconnected events, it biases our idea of the attacker being somehow connected to LE. I think it is time we emphasized we diversify our contact information or find a proper system for distributed encrypted anonymous communications that cannot be shutdown. <br /><br />I like BitMessage and Liberte&#039;s Cables, but I have not yet had the time to investigate BitMessage fully.&nbsp;
