				So I saw this post on the &#039;Silk Road Discussion&#039; forum, wish I coulda replied there, but I don&#039;t have 50 yet... Still, if anyone who also saw this (or didn&#039;t) could answer my question, I&#039;d appreciate it! :)<br /><br />Here&#039;s the OP under the topic &#039;Honest question for vendors...&#039; from the user divinechemicals:<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m pretty drugged up right now so this might sound stupid, but I&#039;m honestly curious: Have you ever looked up your customers on Facebook? I mean you know their names and where they live, it probably wouldn&#039;t be that hard. Obviously you would never friend them or contact them at all, but you ever gotten the urge to see what they look like, what they do, etc.? I don&#039;t know if I could control that urge. I guess that&#039;s why I&#039;m not a vendor&nbsp; ;) &quot;<br /><br />In response to this, most comments said vendors would never do that, or at least wouldn&#039;t admit to it. One comment said the address info is never even looked up, just copied, pasted and deleted. What I&#039;m wondering is how did a vendor know my house-specific zip code extension?? I recently purchased a little bowl from a vendor and sent him my address (encrypted) as follows:<br /><br />My Real Name<br />#### My Street Name<br />My City, STATE XXXXX<br /><br />When I received the item (stealth packaged so it looked like it was coming from a business) the address on the outside was as follows:<br /><br />My Real Name<br />#### My Street Name<br />My City, STATE XXXXX-XXXX<br /><br />Basically, I had sent him my info with my regular 5 digit zip code only, but the address on the package contained my full 5 digit dash 4 digit extension zip code, which is specific to just my house. How did he get the 4 digit extension?? Did he look up my location online? Did the stealth packaging have anything to do with this, like add it automatically?<br /><br />Am I being paranoid for even asking?<br /><br />Well I need to get to 50, so I might as well get something useful out of it. Any and all help is welcomed :)<br /><br />Thanks!

				It&#039;s entirely possible that they verified the correct address through USPS. You can put in an address and it will return the proper USPS approved addressing method. I think that adding the 4 digits helps with the business persona it&#039;s being sent from; most every legit business I order from ends up using my +4.

				I feel it. Thanks for your reply. Would you recommend me sending future vendors my full +4 digit zip code, just to be sure it looks that way on the package?

				If you type an address into usps.com it&#039;ll give you the full zipcode. many vendors request you give them the full 9-digit zip. apparently it gets there faster or something. But yeah, if you&#039;re worried that giving your address to someone might somehow indicate to them where you live, I have news for you...

				Hahahaha! Not worried at all about giving them my address. Obviously necessary for this whole thing to work... More so concerned about sellers looking it up on their computer, as this was the primary concern of people on the original forum. But I&#039;m sure if they&#039;re using Tor while they search and such, I have nothing to be worried about. Which I don&#039;t. Honestly, not worried in the slightest! :) Just thought I should make my first few posts count.

				I think some vendors would look up the address to make sure it is a legitimate address and correctly written. Esp for international this would be important to make sure its written correctly so it will arrive. <br /><br />I think that is the hardest part about SR and the decision on whether or not to use a fake name. The idea of some random person knowing a name that can be linked to you is a bit freaky.
