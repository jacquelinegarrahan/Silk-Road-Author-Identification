				I&#039;ve wondered that myself.&nbsp; There is certainly nothing stopping them from the anonymity aspect, but not sure what the law would say about it.&nbsp; They would essentially be doing the same thing they are trying to get people in trouble for.<br /><br />I also wonder if they ever buy any drugs from vendors to see how it is packaged, so they can know what to look for.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t think they care about small purchases, it&#039;s not like we know who we&#039;re getting it from anyway, so they can&#039;t use us to make a plea bargain to turn the dealers in.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d be interested if the Feds really even care about silk road.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem like it would benefit them to go after safe, anonymous transactions.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I have my plausible deniability in any case.

Would they break the law to keep the law? It would be good cover for finding the big time suppliers. In a way it would be a good thing for us though - ensure a clean supply, unlike the free market!

				yeah no doubt. if you&#039;re buying for personal use, then you&#039;re not a big enough fish for the feds to fry.<br /><br />these tulane chumps got too big for their britches and the feds jumped on it. If you&#039;re buying mdma in bulk, then you probably have cause for concern.

				Your friendly vendor might not be law enforcement, but what if they fail to purge your address and they get busted?&nbsp; Maybe not a big deal if you only order $40 of stuff but lots of people in here probably order more than that.&nbsp; In the US it is only a matter of time before multiple vendors go down.&nbsp; What if they find your address with more than one vendor?&nbsp; Or what if a vendor gets caught but agrees to help law enforcement get a bunch of customers?<br /><br />If your local police have enough time on their hands they might just search your address.&nbsp; Getting a search warrant isn&#039;t hard for them.<br /><br />paranoia is essential because too many people are too comfortable buying drugs on here.&nbsp; People are getting caught and going to jail.&nbsp; Posting to the forums isn&#039;t their priority when that happens.

Surely all the big venders know to get rid of any information on their customers? I would be worried if I were one on the mass mailing front though, I mean how the hell do you send out dozens of that kinda package from one place without arousing suspicion? That one might be best left unanswered but I hope they have a strategy for that. I think where you live plays a big role in how careful you need to be if you&#039;re just after dimebags etc.
