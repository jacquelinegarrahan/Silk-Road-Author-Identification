				Firstly thanks/apologies if this is a lame question :)<br /><br />Ok so PGP is a fundamental must have pretty much as is Tails, there&#039;s also running TOR from a USB and a host of other configurations.<br />I&#039;m going to give myself a long time to get properly acquainted with best practices on SR but would like to find the best route to do so. Should I simply scour the various topics until the bigger picture comes into view or is there specific links I may utilize to better and faster learn necessary rudiments and methods?<br /><br />Much respect Namaste,<br /><br />M

				A random suggestion to ramp up my post number:<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest to encrypt your USB stick with TrueCrypt - with a hidden partition in case you live in a country where LE can force you to give up your password...

				Of course this mostly applies for vendors - LE usually doesn&#039;t care how much you bought and consumed in the past (depends on your jurisdiction of course - and this is a worst case scenario for a user now; LE usually cares about distribution... then again you might live in the USA :-))... as a user you should be more concerned about concealing the product in your home - if you want to be concerned at all. :-)

For the casual user though, using the tor browser bundle on your regular OS is safe enough. It&#039;s good to put SR related files on a hidden volume though, like gpg4usb that should have all your vendor keys and stuff like that. Hiding torbrowser in tself isn&#039;t very important though IMO, unless you have bookmarks on it. Keep a copy of torbrowser on a non encrypted drive for plausible deniability. <br />I&#039;d also suggest doing a full disk encryption if you don&#039;t use a live USB like TAILS. The safest way though is whonix, with whonix you can safely open PDFs, view flash videos, run java applets and things like that without compromising your anonymity.

To encrypt a message to Bob you use Bob&#039;s public key, only Bob can decrypt that message because it&#039;s decrypted with a different key (obviously). If you don&#039;t know about PGP then you won&#039;t understand that.<br /><br />The link in his sig links to a post containing his public key.

				once ya get yur PGP client set up you will creat a &quot;Public Key&quot; which you will then use to pass to your friends to safetly<br />communicate with them.<br />Also you will need to copy any of your vendors &quot;Public Key&quot; so that you can encrypt your personal information when placing and order.<br /><br />Hope this helps ya :)<br /><br />Peace &amp; Hugs,<br /><br />ChemCat&nbsp; O0

				It just warms my heart to see Newbies using this discussion to learn about SR and security.&nbsp; ;) In all seriousness, good job Moloko, actually using the forums as a tool instead of using them as a garbage can.&nbsp; The new members who have contributed to&nbsp; this thread are the kind whom I like to see becoming part of the SR community.
