Couldn&#039;t wait to get off work, drove straight home, opened the door, and there they were! Sitting on the dining room table in a small, innocent envelope. Opened it up, aw yiss.<br /><br />I have to admit...until I actually opened the pack up, about 5% of me still suspected Silk Road was just a scam and getting drugs in the mail was way too easy. I&#039;m so glad it (kind of) is.

				It is exciting, isn&#039;t it? Once about 6 months before I found SR I did a email order and got scammed for about $250. I knew it wouldn&#039;t work, but I had to try it. In my life I do not run across many people to get my pills from, actually I only know one, and my doctors were becoming suspicious and very stingy with the Percs for my back issues. So, after all the searching to get things set up and reading the forums I figured I had to give it a try. With a smaller order this time : )<br /><br />When I got my first package I was in shock!. Holy shit, you could actually buy drugs on line, financially safe just like ebay. Of course not legally 100%, safe, nothing ever will be, but as safe as possible with Tor and pgp, etc.. For days I kept thinking, holy shit : ) <br /><br />I&#039;ve been on a little over a month now I think and I&#039;ve gotten about 4 orders. Every vendor has been great, especially these past few weeks with all the down time. They go out of their way to help you out. Well enjoy your package, it might take until you get another before you truly believe it, lol.

				I remember getting my first package not to long ago. When it finally came in I was like this is really happening!!!! At first I thought it was a scam. After that moment I knew I had stumbled onto something very special, and life changing.
