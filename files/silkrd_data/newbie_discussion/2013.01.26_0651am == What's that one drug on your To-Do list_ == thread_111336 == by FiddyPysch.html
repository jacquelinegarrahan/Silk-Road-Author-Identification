				What&#039;s the one drug you&#039;ve always wanted to try, but haven&#039;t gotten around to yet? <br /><br />Me, I&#039;m really looking into the 2C&#039;s right now. I&#039;m obsessed with psychedelics, and have had great experiences with both LSD and Shrooms. I just love the feeling of trying something new.

				i couldn&#039;t tell you specifically about LSD because i have never taken it. but for me 25i is extremely visually. everything is &quot;breathing&quot; and moving and morphing, nothing standing still. tons of colors and the colors just look amazing. depending on your setting you can feel very relaxed and chill or very energetic and upbeat. you get a sense of interconnectedness between things and certain people may give off different &quot;vibes&quot; than others. very cool visuals though everything wiggling and moving and tracers after things.

				to FiddyPysch ,<br />I have experiences with these two thing (25i-C-nbome and acid). Acid is way better but 25i is great also. There is a few very important differences. If you just want to get high, to have a great night etc. - use a 25i - it is really great for that. But if you want hard evening, with awesome visuals and some transcedental experiences, you have to take acid.

				Definitely want to try IV DMT. Don&#039;t know if will ever get an opportunity though. <br /><br />Smoking DMT is fine and dandy, but only lasts 5-10 minutes tops. Having a rate-adjustable IV dropper would be something else.

				Mescaline. A massive, vision-quest-inducing amount of mescaline.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard some really crazy trip reports on it and it seems like one of the most spiritually shaking substances out there (besides DMT possibly).&nbsp; I just don&#039;t have the patience to grow a cactus for 5 years yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also wouldn&#039;t mind trying ketamine, I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s pretty fun if you&#039;re into just being good old fashioned fucked up.

				Anyone considered Salvia?<br />I had a very large dose of the 50x extract once; all i could see were strips of colour representing my conciousness that were thrown together by chance, it was like waking and realising all of life had been a complicated illusion based on the chance orientation of these colours - a machine was stripping the colours one by one, unaware of my existence, and i thought it was the end. But without fear or panic, just a sudden realisation of &quot;what is real&quot;... and the world had been an illusion so there was no real attachment to it anyway.<br />Took me several hours to come to grips with the fact i was alive and in the world again afterwards...<br />Might sound like a bad trip but it was actually fairly damn good!

				Psychedelics are easily my favorite category of drugs, and I&#039;ve tried most of the major ones and even quite a few of the not-so-important ones, but there&#039;s three that I&#039;ve been looking to try for a LONG time.<br /><br />1. 2C-T-7<br />2. Mescaline<br />3. DOM<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems like these three are rarely offered on the Silk Road. Especially DOM, I&#039;ve never even seen it here, not even once. It&#039;s a shame, I feel like if someone brought good, powdered DOM to SR at good prices they could make some pretty good money!

				Hey,<br />I&#039;ve ticked most off my to-do list, but there are a few left. DMT I&#039;ve never done, and I would love to. Also, a truly heroic dose of shrooms (5g+) would be great to try, I&#039;ve tried heroin before but it isn&#039;t my favorite narcotic (luckily) and so I&#039;m not too bothered about trying Oxy or other synthetic opiates. I would also love to try the 2c family, which I have never done before.<br /><br />Ethylphenidate I hear is a really good stimulant, especially for those who really enjoy coke (as I do), so that is definitely on my list. All in all, the more time I spend on the road the more new chemicals I discover and investigate, the longer my to-do list gets ;)<br /><br />- JH

				25b has been on my to-do list for awhile, just haven&#039;t gotten around to ordering any yet. Somewhat nervous due to the high amount of 25i I&#039;ve done and the feeling it&#039;s left over on my brain after each trip.

				As a starter, I decided to start with the weed, to go easy on this, and to familiarize myself with SR.<br /><br />Now, after I browsed for a little, I am aiming at LSD and 2C-b. First one is classic, and second one was advised for me by some random person on the Internets. He told me that it has a shorter effect than LSD (4-8 hours vs 10-12), it&#039;s softer overall, cheaper a little, is aphrodisiac (ROFL) and gonna trip my balls off. But I read about an important downside - if you have vegeto-vascular dystonia, it&#039;s ill-advised to use psychs at all and 2C-b in particular, because it can turn a harmless condition into something a little bit more dangerous. Though I will spend some time doing workouts to exercise my blood circulatory system and will try it nevertheless.

				Careful with those 2-5&#039;s. LSD has always been kind to me but for a while all that I could find was extremely bitter/nasty tasting blotters.
