				Hi, I don&#039;t seem to be able to post in any other forums, so I thought I&#039;d post here.<br /><br />I am *fascinated* by Salvia Divinorum.<br /><br />If anyone does not know much about it and wants to, good info here: http://www.sagewisdom.org/faq.html<br /><br />It is the most powerful naturally occurring hallucinogen, in terms of power it blows the pants off LSD but is very short lived (5-15 minutes if smoked, up to 1.5 hours via other methods). I believe it also blows the pants off DMT, but I have read it is so different that is can&#039;t be compared to either.<br /><br />I have read that trying super strong extracts (like x60 to x200 etc) is NOT a good idea, unless you have extensive experience with it. In general you want to work your way up from a low potency, until you find the right level for yourself.<br /><br />I am surprised there is none in Australia and no apparent interest in it in this country? For me it is something I must try, but I am hoping to avoid having to important some myself (I have no experience yet with international orders).<br /><br />I have joined the road over the last few months and ordered several times- every time totally satisfied. However, I am new to the forum.<br /><br />I can&#039;t post in the request section, but I would love it if someone else who finds interest in this stuff would consider putting an Australian request for this substance in the request section. I am sure others would want to try it if they read enough info about it. At this stage I only want the raw leaf, and X5 extract. I want to try these and gradually work my way up, as suggested in the good FAQ at the website I linked above. I am willing to pay good money if anyone can get some in Australia.<br /><br />Seeya<br /><br />
