				I hope I am preaching to the choir with this post. I have been getting a number of messages by PM and through the forums saying &quot;hey I have the info you&#039;re looking for&quot; or &quot;I can help you out with that thing you&#039;re looking for if you&#039;re real&quot; and so on and the providing me with an email address.<br />NEVER communicate with anyone regarding SR matters using ANY email address. You will instantly negate the anonymity SR provides and you and everything about you can become an open book.<br />In my opinion these messages are LE phishing attempts and if you fall for it, you put yourself and others at risk.<br />I hope this post is totally unnecessary and anyone who reads it thinks &quot;man this person must think we are complete morons&quot;. And I hope that&#039;s what you think because that means you are being safe. I don&#039;t think anyone on SR is a moron, but there are people, especially newbies, who just may not have given any thought to this particular method of LE attempting to get you to reveal yourself. My mantra is &quot;Protect myself, protect myself&quot;. When I protect myself I am also helping to protect everyone else. There is no such thing as being too safe. <br />Have a great day comrades! <br />

I&#039;m fairly tech smart but the top level stuff is beyond me and I&#039;m not going to make statements outside my level of expertise so I can&#039;t be positive about the anonymous email. I do know from reading posts by people like Pine that I can be doing more to be safer, so my current project is trying to create a Virtual Machine, and my understanding is that will up my safety factor considerably. It seems to me that there is more and more of these sketchy things happening (like the emails I, and others I&#039;m am sure, are getting) and it makes me think LE may have more of a presence on here recently. After the big darknet pedophile (just writing that word pisses me off, people who hurt children are truly evil) bust, LE may be looking to see if they can do something headline worthy with SR, so my antenna are extra sensitive. As the saying goes &quot;Just because you&#039;re paranoid doesn&#039;t mean they aren&#039;t after you‚Äù .
