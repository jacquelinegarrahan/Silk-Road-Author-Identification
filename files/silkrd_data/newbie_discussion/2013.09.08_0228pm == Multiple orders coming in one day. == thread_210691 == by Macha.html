				Hey guys, I have not made many transactions on SR but would like to know from some people if it&#039;s safe to have multiple packages from different vendors coming to mail on the same day? I assume there will be no return addresses, so would that raise any flags?

				It happens, I mean unless you are dealing with shitty vendors, its not a big deal. Consider how many people order from amazon, and ebay in a day..more then a few..and amazon sends multiple boxes all the time. <br /><br />There is a mailman who was posting in the shipping forum last month, basically he said they just want to deliver your mail and get it done..unless its leaking or reeks to hell and back.<br /><br />I have had multiple priority packs show up on the same day, and once 2 express came at once..they were not suspicious looking, and they were delivered just fine. Sometimes its from ebay, the road, amazon, and really thinking about it, with proper precautions there is no reason to worry.<br /><br />And of course vendors use return addresses, they just are not theirs. No return address would fall under not slightly odd, and the idea is to blend in.

				you need not worry. at least not more than one usually tends to when waiting for an order. <br />whether it&#039;s still your first orders, at which point you can physically feel the occasional paranoia, blowing ever so gently into your stomach flower,<br />or be it you are no stranger to the Road, an experienced package-receiver, if you will; at which point - you feel no physical paranoia - yet, it remains there, in a hammock, resting in your subconscious, not alert, but logical, and wise.<br /><br />LL<br />

				Yeah, don&#039;t worry about it. Mail is mail to the mailman, just remember not to sign for anything.

				surely you&#039;d be fine as long as you didn&#039;t suddenly get an avalanche of mail/sign for any of it.

				I really don&#039;t think it matters. Postal workers see so much mail everyday, they wouldn&#039;t think twice about it.

				not trying to hijack the thread, but i have a relevant dumdum question. does anybody ever have multiple packages incoming for the same product from different vendors? if so, how do you tell them apart, so you know who to finalize? do you ask vendors to put a clue in the package?

				Well, at least it&#039;s good to hear that most mailmen just want to get the mail out and end their day. Thanks for the replies everyone!

				You have a mail man, UPS man, Fedex man, etc. to them it&#039;s just another piece of mail or package. Don&#039;t worry about it, order as you please. Just be smart about it. A red flag won&#039;t be raised for getting package. But let&#039;s say you start picking things up on a schedule, well that might raise a red flag but even then I doubt it. Random purchases here and there are probably your best bet. Even buying a bunch of stuff in one shot isn&#039;t sketchy. Sometimes they&#039;d rather deliver you everything in one shot. Don&#039;t worry man, MAIL IS MAIL.

				I have had multiple express post letters come on the same day and I did have a green cross marked on one of them.&nbsp; Not sure what this means, if anything? Have also heard of other people with similar markings.. anyone have a clue as to what this means?
