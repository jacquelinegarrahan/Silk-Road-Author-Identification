				Im obviously a newbie and buying for the first time.&nbsp; But the seller wants newbies or ppl without a good reputation or no rating(like myself) to release the funds before shipping the package.&nbsp; The seller to be specific is rorock.&nbsp; He has a 100% rating but I was told countless times not to release funds.&nbsp; Since there is no way around this should I release the funds early or just find another seller that doesnt require this?&nbsp; Thanks for the help

				In my personal opinion, unless you trust the vendor because you&#039;ve dealt with them many times before (and even then, finalizing early is always still a risk) then I would cancel my order and find a vendor who allows you to remain in escrow.

				A lot of vendor say that if you have no/bad rating must FE i only do if i have used said vendor before with no problem(still a risk) but most vendors wpnt sacrifice there good rating to rip you off but you never know till you go

				I&#039;m a newbie too, obviously.&nbsp; It says (s)he requires FE from new users in their seller profile.&nbsp; Why not message the seller to ask what new members need to do to verify their validity.&nbsp; Maybe you can FE a small sample purchase first, the do normal business?&nbsp; <br /><br />I messaged the vendors I would be using days ahead of time letting them know I am a new account, waiting for my bitcoins to come through, and if they had any issues working with me to please let me know before I placed an order.&nbsp; The responses I got were all positive.<br /><br />Good Luck

Go to another vendor that doesn&#039;t require FE. It&#039;s that simple. I like the peace of mind that comes with escrow. It makes waiting for the mailman so much more less stressful.

				Look for a trusted vendor that offers tracking.<br /><br />I did that for my first 5 purchases and none of them required FE(because of tracking so they can prove to SR that something was sent and received if you scam them)

With tracking is even better, but alot of vendors don&#039;t offer tracking because it gives away their shipping location.

				DONT DO IT REDDOT!!!!!! RESIST THE TEMPTATION!!!! I was ripped off by a vendor who at the time was reputable. Thats what people are doing now. Building up there accounts then ripping people off SR WILL NOT HELP YOU if you go outside escrow. I know you want your order but find someone else that doesnt ask for FE..... Seriously dont dont dont do it. Once you hit finalize your order disappears from the screen and there is nothing you can do. Its all in the vendors hands. They are drug dealers and by reputation not always the most honest lot. There are some especially on here that try to maintain high standards but there are about 50x more who just want your money and couldnt give a shit about you.

				if you fe at least choose someone with 100% feedback. there are plenty of vendors selectively scamming via fe and their feedback score reflects this

				It&#039;s entirely up to you. If you feel like you trust the vendor enough to FE, then do it. If you don&#039;t want to take that chance to be ripped off, then don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve FE&#039;d for free shipping before and received items from well reviewed vendors, but you never know. Some people do not get so lucky.

				Never, ever FE! Never, ever!<br /><br />Way to many cases of good vendors going bad and having their usual customer base FE for them and then scamming them!
