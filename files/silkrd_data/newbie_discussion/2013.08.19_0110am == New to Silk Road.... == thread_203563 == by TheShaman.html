				Hello!&nbsp; I am rather new to the Silk Road, been a long time lurker and wanted to take the plunge.&nbsp; <br /><br />I figured there would have been a pinned discussion on the topic, but I haven&#039;t seen it. Is there a thread on here that goes into detail what you have to do in order to get a successful order complete.&nbsp; I mean a step by step process and explanation on procuring Bitcoin, Digital wallets, security precautions,&nbsp; and transferring finds to the SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />If someone could please help me out with this request, I would be most grate :Dful<br /><br />BTW- I am living in United States.&nbsp;

				Just do a bit of research, none of these things are too terribly difficult. For coins, if you&#039;re looking for the fastest way to get them at the moment, I&#039;d check localbitcoins.com and try to find someone in your area to get them. A lot of people seem to enjoy using Coinbase.com , but your bank account must be linked to the site in order for you to buy coins, not to mention it can take a bit of time to get verified, and then it takes something like 6 business days for your first purchase to go through.<br /><br />Coinbase also acts as a wallet, but if you don&#039;t want to use their site, there are a number of wallets available, online, for your desktop, mobile device, etc. You get a series of random characters that make up your wallet address, and you simply just get the bitcoins transferred to the address once you&#039;ve managed to obtain them. <br /><br />Like I said, just look around and read some things; it&#039;s not too hard.

				Be sure to research the vendor also. Make sure he is reliable. Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re super careful and a careless vendor does a poor job at packaging.

				I have a nice buzz going and I am actually getting pretty comfortable on SR so I will post a summary of what I learned so far.<br /><br />I started on reddit. [**CLEARNET WARNING**]http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/wiki/index[CLEARNET]. You can copy that link into your browser but it is not an onion site and thus more vulnerable to tracking or something (maybe someone else can clarify). That is why I (and others I learned from) use the clearnet warning.<br /><br />That link will give you pretty much everything you need to know to get started on SR including buying bitcoins and encrypting private information.<br /><br />(continues below)

				What follows is my own summary of what I think is important for you to learn to get started. Please do more research with multiple sources to get the best of idea of what to do as you can&#039;t trust some random dude on the internet (except for me of course! lol). Most of my information comes from the reddit sr wiki anyway.<br /><br />Write your login names and passwords down somewhere where you won&#039;t lose them. SR does not allow recovery of forgotten passwords and you can lose your money this way.<br /><br />Bitcoins: I worked my way on coinbase.com to get instant bitcoins. They usually are discounted too which is sweet. You will have to make 1 purchase and wait a month, and provide them with verifiable personal information which doesn&#039;t even work for everyone, and you may not be comfortable giving out your personal information. Localbitcoins seems to be a good service too, and you can do cash deals. <br /><br />wallet: I transfer my BTC to my digital wallet before I send them to SR. I use bitcoin-qt. Many people say this is unnecessary.<br /><br />Encryption (PGP = pretty good privacy): When you send your address to the vendor (usually when you complete the order from your cart) you should always encrypt your name and address. The details are a bit different whether you use PC or Mac (or other?). I use a mac program called gpg keychain access. You will need the vendor&#039;s public key, usually present on their SR profile. Use the link below for step by step details.<br /><br />[**CLEARNET]http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/wiki/guides[CLEARNET] <br /><br />READ IT. Mac and PC versions are there. Righteous also has a brief PC guide on his SR profile. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b0ea6121e7 <br /><br />Finding a vendor: Look at their average rating on SR, the number of transactions, how long they have been a vendor for, but don&#039;t rely on that stuff. Check the forums, too, particularly the rumor mill. Research multiple vendors before choosing one. If you rush it you are taking more risk. Righteous is an example of a vendor who has high ratings and a good reputation from what I have seen. (No he is not paying me to advertise for him lol but I do like 25i)<br /><br />Security: Experienced and reputable vendors often use high levels of stealth to conceal their products. Do not ever talk about the details of the vendors stealth and packaging as that could compromise their security. All personal information sharing should be encrypted. <br /><br />In the rare case that your package is seized by customs (in the US at least) you will probable receive what is called a &quot;love letter&quot; where customs tells you that they seized it. I have never heard of any further action from law enforcement (LE) after someone receives the love letter. Often vendors will split the cost with you or offer a reship (even a full refund) if a package is lost or seized. Everyone is on the alert for scammers however so your reputation may affect your ability to get reships/refunds. LE don&#039;t usually go after personal quantities so if you don&#039;t buy bulk or sell they probably can&#039;t afford to bother with you anyway.<br /><br />Purchasing: Find the item, add it to cart. Go to cart, pick shipping, update. Paste PGP message containing your ENCRYPTED address encrypted specifically for the vendor&#039;s pubkey. Type in your super top secret pin that you probably want to change every now and then just to be safe. Hit the button and bam! The vendor is notified of your order and your bitcoins are put into escrow. DO NOT FINALIZE. ONLY FINALIZE WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE ORDER (and do it right away to be polite).<br /><br />NEVER FE. Some vendors may require that you finalize when you place the order instead of waiting to receive the product (the whole point of escrow). This is called finalizing early (FE). Unless you don&#039;t care about your money, it&#039;s wise to find another vendor if you can. FE is how you get scammed, and it might even piss off good vendors who don&#039;t write down your address and can only see it until you finalize (SR rules require them to not record addresses and destroy records).<br /><br />Finalize when you receive the package. Do not wait until it auto-finalizes after 17 days as it will show up in your purchasing stats, implying you won&#039;t finalize when you receive a package. Feel free to inspect/weigh/test the product though. Also you can go back and change the feedback that you left when you finalized if it turns out the product is garbage or not what you ordered. *Only do this if you are not able to resolve it with the vendor privately. If everything arrives as promised, or the vendor is responsive and solves the problem, leave them a 5/5. <br /><br />If you do not receive your package after 15 days, do not panic. Simply go to your orders on SR and submit a resolution to the vendor (refund or extension). Usually the first resolution you will offer will be an extension of say 1 or 2 weeks. Sometimes the vendor will offer a resolution first. Check out their profile to see if they have a policy for these sort of things (shipping).<br /><br />That&#039;s all I can think of right now. I hope that was coherent and helpful.<br />&nbsp;<br />EDITs: For MAX security (as far as my knowledge goes) you can download the program Tails and put it on a zip drive. Then you boot your computer from tails (it&#039;s an OS with PGP and Tor installed) and everything you do while it&#039;s running is stored on your ram and erased when you shut down/restart. [**CLEARNET WARNING**]https://tails.boum.org/[CLEARNET]<br /><br />Tip: Feel like gambling? http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206086.msg1480678#msg1480678<br /><br />Additional edits for spelling and grammar...

				Also I want to add DO NOT follow random links to SR you find on the internet (or atlantis or whatever). There are many phishing attempts to get your SR login information! You will never have to enter your pin to login to SR.<br /><br />I remember it like silkroad vee bee 5 piz3r (pronounced pie zerr) .onion. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion that is the right link but if you use it you may be missing my point lol.
