				Does anyone know some other trusted site where you can buy prescription medicines (without prescription of course).<br />I tried to find METYRAPONE(trade name Metopirone), but i couldn&#039;t find it from silk road. Internet is full of other places where<br />i could buy med, but many are scams. That&#039;s why i would like to know does anyone have experiences of any good? <br />

				&quot;this one have a fun factor I&#039;m not aware of ?&quot; I have a feeling that no :P I&#039;m looking it for experimentation.<br />Problem is that it is not used in my country at all and i have read about only few cases who got it in very special cases.<br />Any way would be useful to know other sites where meds could be found.

				just search it on clearnet, i used to use them and the pills actually worked, i mostly bought xanax and kpins but i remember them having a ton of other stuff! Using those websites is actually what brought me to SR as a matter of fact.

				I have actually searched, but i have no idea what site is real and what is scam(take my money or/and send me placebo/something else). That&#039;s why i have a feeling that real deals are something that &quot;underground society&#039;s&quot; such this one might know better.&nbsp; Good to hear that pills have worked(if we talk about same thing).<br /><br />And thanks GlenRunciter, maybe i could check those as well. If it doesn&#039;t take much effort from you&nbsp; :)
