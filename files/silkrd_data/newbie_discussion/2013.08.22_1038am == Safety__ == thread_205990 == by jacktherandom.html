				I&#039;m wondering how security for the buyer and the vendor is kept?<br />I know that not every parcel is searched, but if it is, isn&#039;t the buyer compromised because the address is on the letter?<br />Also, how would it be possible for a new vendor to start trading? Wouldn&#039;t they be distrusted as police because the police could get your address... Sorry I&#039;m paranoid, just want to figure out how to keep secure while buying.<br /><br />Also, the forum keeps mentioning &quot;escrow&quot; which is just a middle man service, but how can you use it and be kept anonymous? Or is there a Bitcoin escrow?

				yeah you are paranoid.<br /><br />maybe this isn&#039;t for you if you really are that paranoid. but you should think to yourself that this has been going 2 years now, its obviously working on the whole otherwise nobody would use it. you are definitely at less risk than you would be walking home with shit on you. you have plausible deniability. that means that they cannot prove beyond doubt that you ordered for drugs to be sent to you. just to be on the safe side tho, clean your house whenever you&#039;re expecting a parcel. even put your laptop or hard drive in your neighbors house if you have to. the police can&#039;t prove that they didn&#039;t send the drugs in the post to you just to set you up, which is why they rarely bother to knock, instead the drugs just get confiscated. if this happens tho, don&#039;t go ordering any more because your mail will be scrutinized for a period afterwards.

				I would suggest you do a little more research on Silk Road before asking those kind of questions my friend. Why not try DPs own guide: http://www.silkroadlink.com<br /><br />PGP is the key to security around here, and yes there is always a risk of a package getting intercepted, its rare, and as mentioned the package alone proves nothing!!<br /><br />Clean house regular man, read up on PGP.... SR is safe enough for sure!!!
