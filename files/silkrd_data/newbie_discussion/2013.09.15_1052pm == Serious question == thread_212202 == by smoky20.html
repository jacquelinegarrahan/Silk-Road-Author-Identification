				if you look up tracking does it give the address the package is going to? if not then the best bet is to get in contact with your vendor, i would shoot the vendor a message to see if he may have mixed up the tracking numbers with another order. if it was confiscated im sure you would have gotten some kind of memo about it.

				should the last point on my tracking state the address used? it just says the town postcode not the actual house address? and if it had been seized would it not have went into customs? nothing mentioning inbound to customs on the record

				the package went to the correct town right? if so you might want to double check the address you gave the vendor. i would give it a few more days to see if it arrives, if it doesnt show then contact the vendor for the next steps.

				the last stop on the tracking where it says delivered is just the postcode for the town i sent it to but no actual address? could that mean it was just accidentally scanned as delivered or what could be up? Thank you for taking the time to help me out freaking out about it

				Who is the vendor? It could be a scam.<br />He may have sent an empty package to a location in a different part of town and given you a tracking number so he could claim he mailed it.<br />Take it to resolution if you can&#039;t work things out with the vendor.<br />Also, you might want to check with the admins to see if there have been any similar complaints about this vendor. Good luck.

				i have been pondering that idea myself and tbh i would rather it was a scam other than it being intercepted. Vendor is a high ranked weed seller only for two months tho. If it says delivered could that be to trick me? and its actually been intercepted? That is my main concern. What do yous think it could be? I assumed on the tracking information once it was delivered the lest point would be delivered: My address. But it just says Delivered:postcode in my town

				Ive been scammed before where sender sends to different address.&nbsp; If that is the case, chances are it was just a box filled with newspapers and no product.&nbsp; Unless he put the wrong address there is literally NO way it would say delivered unless it came to your door or you went to pick it up at the PO.&nbsp; Although in the USA USPS fucks things up royally all the time, and employees get lazy and say they delivered things, or left notes, and no notes were actually left, nor packages delivered.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can always call the post office and provide the tracking number and see if they can locate where it went.&nbsp; Ive had to do that before.&nbsp; Make a dummy email address for them to contact you at if they respond via email to follow up on things.

				Tempted to ring the post office in the morning and see what happens from their. Have never received tracking before so not 100% how it works. It says<br />Item delivered :Time:Date:Postcode:<br /><br />The postcode its saying it delivered to is not mine but is close by and does not have any sort of address attached to it. I thought one a package was delivered it would state on the tracking<br />Item Delivered :Time:Date:My Address:Postcode<br /><br />Yet it only states a postcode and not mine at that.<br /><br />So in my mind either postman scanned all his packages at the same time and has just been late delivering the item, seller made a mistake with the address and some random person has my g or its a scam and he sent a pile of shite to a random address near by.<br /><br />Doubtful it would have been seized if it states delivered am i wrong?

				If it was seized, it would have never made it out of Customs.&nbsp; They dont list delivery addresses on the tracking website. Call the post office and tell them you were expecting a package but it never arrived, although it says it was delivered, and then give them the tracking number so they can sort it out.&nbsp; It might be sitting at the post office, or it was delivered to the wrong address (or the sender is a scammer who intentionally put the wrong address on the box)

				Thanks very much for taking the time to reply eases my mind that it shouldn&#039;t have been seized, that was my biggest concern. Will ring in morning if their is still no package and will update with what i find out. Will also release sellers name if it turns out to be a scam, it is my first order with him but a friend of mine received a pound only two weeks ago which is why i went to him. He could be a selective scammer only time will tell. Hopefully it was just a mix up and i will be a happy person tomorrow&nbsp; 8)

				Requested an extension with seller, rang the tracking company and they said once it leaves the country its updated on what should happen and is not 100% accurate so im hoping that the site is messed up and my package will be here any day. Usually 10-12 days from where i ordered from but this time the tracking said delivered after 5. Tomorrow is the 11th day so i will be praying
