				And how does the karma system work? +1/-2 = 1 positive and 2 negative votes from buyers/sellers, or can random people vote too?

				You need over 100 posts to leave karma. To see if a vendor is serious, here&#039;s a checklist:<br /><br />1. Make sure they posted their PGP key on the listing/vendor profile as well as the forum.<br />2. Make sure they have a forum review thread, read the reviews. If they don&#039;t have a review thread, that&#039;s a big minus.<br />3. Do a search fo the vendor name on the forum and see what people are saying.<br />4. Karma is not an indicator of trustworthiness as some people leave bad karma for comments, view points, or products that they don&#039;t agree with (i.e. cyanide).<br />5. Obviously check the reviews on the item you are interested in as well as the vendor profile reviews for all items.<br />6. See how long they have been in business and the number of transactions along with the total rating (0-100).<br /><br />

				Well as a potential new vender....trying to learn the ropes prior to signing up....check out their vender page, then ask questions.<br /><br />Just because you only have a few posts or history, does not mean they are NOT serious.&nbsp; Just means they new to SR.<br /><br />Also from what I can tell never &quot;Finalize Early&quot;......from my view point....that is where the problem lies.<br /><br />I have used many other sites...and the problem with a honest vender is believing customers will actually pay when they receive the product......i have been burned may times....by customers not paying.......now SR is a different story.....venders get paid when customer &quot;finalizes&quot; or at the latest 17 days after...if the customer never finalizes....in my book, if the customer can&#039;t finalize after they receive their product.....I do not want them as a customer....Venders need their money...and U have received your product.....from a customer standpoint....just wait till you receive your product....and finalize....if the tracking number says delivered....the vender knows u got your product....don&#039;t play that game.....&quot;dude i never got it&quot;....that is for punks, rippers, jackers, and stupid people....and there are always people looking for free meds.<br /><br />Customers need to be realistic in what they want and what they want to pay for?....You are not going to get AAA top shelf indoor medical cannibas for a cheap price......You Get what you pay for.......if all you want to do is get high....go with the cheap stuff....but if you want smooth....good tasting....good smelling...full of frosty trichomes...has excellent bag appeal (where you can show anyone a jewel) and you know it was grown with care...using no synthetics...and no harmful chemicals or sprays....and was grown to OMRI standards....you will pay more.<br /><br />Of course I am talking about WEED......I have personally seen DDT....Bleach.....Raid......and other very harmful chemicals sprayed on large outdoor grows.....it&#039;s disgusting......every time I saw that....I asked they WHY?.....they said it&#039;s just weed....I not going to smoke it.....who cares?.......SMH<br /><br />So as a customer.....be realistic....get educated.......and when you find an honest vender keep them happy....because they are not easy to find.<br /><br />good luck

				I don&#039;t even see a point to restrict things on the forums based on post count since they don&#039;t even seem to actively moderate the forums to prevent spam (whether to scam/attempt to direct traffic to a different site or to up post count).
