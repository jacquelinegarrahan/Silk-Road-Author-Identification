				&nbsp;Ok, let&#039;s assume I&#039;m going to smoke some cocaine.&nbsp; I could either buy a gram of crack,&nbsp; or a gram of powder coke to prepare as such. <br /><br />So what makes more economic sense?&nbsp; It seems some of the coke vendors offer their product either way. So would it be more cost-effective to buy the powder or hard?

				If you buy the puro, why not cook your own? The majority will turn hard anyway if it&#039;s not a cut-up job. <br /><br />Shit I&#039;ve seen crackheads cook their own shit from some of the worst coke out there, of course the returns aren&#039;t that great, but you get what you pay for right?

				Since I need posts to get out of the noob section , lets talk about technique for a while. My recipe is:<br /><br />Dump about a gram of coke into a spoon or small metal cooker of some sort. <br /><br />I then add a &#039;pinch&#039; of baking soda. I dunno, maybe around&nbsp; 1/4 tsp. not sure what the proper ratio is here tbh. <br /><br />Then I add basically a pinch of water. Just drip in enough to barely cover everything and mix it up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gently heat until it stars reacting. Once it gets going pretty well I remove it from the heat and it continues to bubble and react for a while. <br /><br />This basically yields a nice oily waxy creamy product which you can scrape off the cooker with a knife or penny or something and apply directly to your pipe-char or whatever you&#039;re using to smoke. <br /><br />Cont...

				...(cont)<br /><br />Technically you&#039;re supposed to leave it to dry, maybe heat lamp it or something but I have never done such a thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some 10 years ago when I first tried cooking my own the only recipes I could find on the Internet were scarce. And they didn&#039;t seem to work for me. I think they all called for too much water.&nbsp; Like the rocks are supposed to float to the top and excess baking soda sinks to the bottom.&nbsp; I dunno but it just doesn&#039;t work for me if I use too much&nbsp; water. <br /><br />Also it seems like I just end up with a whole spoonful of product my way. Everything that&#039;s on there gets scraped and smoked. Turns out fine, I think.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I guess I wonder if I&#039;m being wasteful at all -- like possibly leaving some unreacted coke hcl in the mix that just burns up in the pipe.

				Oh, I forgot there&#039;s also the part where you cool it by putting the spoon on ice or dripping some ice cube drops onto it after it&#039;s done cooking.<br /><br />

				I like to do it in a small glass &#039;ginseng&#039; bottle. I use a 4:1 coke to baking soda ratio and put twice as much water as it would take to cover the powder. heat from the bottom steadily until you hear the &#039;popping&#039; sound of the reaction and you see the oil coming to the top. when there&#039;s no more popping, there won&#039;t be any more oil. then flick the bottle a few times and swirl it around so that all the oil comes together to form a single glob. slowly pour out about 1/2 of the water and replace with cold water. continue to swirl until you hear the &#039;tink&#039; sound of the rock hitting the glass. pop that sucker out and viola!
