				Quit spamming! We get that you gambled with FE and lost, grow up big boy. Life in the fast lane always causes accidents for the reckless. If there is a review thread for MendicinoMistress post your experience there. Post it once and get over your crying, we don&#039;t want to hear it.

				SR can do nothing if you FE other than what it appears they did, shut down the vendor account. If you had done any research at all you would know you FE at your own risk. Did you do a search on this vendor for reviews before purchasing? If there were no reviews and this vendor was brand new do you see the risk associated with that? If you want to be mad at anyone be mad at yourself. Hopefully this will be a good lesson for you and you will apply this knowledge to your next purchases.

				One of us? you&#039;re part of the problem, mate. - The best thing you or anyone else on SR can do to reduce the liklihood of scammers, is to not FE... Think it over. If nobody FEs then scammers will eventually quit trying. This is one of the basic rules of SR that everyone tells you about. The fault lies with you and you alone.

				The original poster appears to have the intelligence of a rock. The site has an escrow system set up to protect people from scams; you bypass it for a known scammer and then complain when it doesn&#039;t protect you. What a dumbass... Do you expect them to then take money out of their profits to repay you for your idiocy? Get real. Chalk it up to a lesson learned (the hard way since you&#039;re incapable of learning the easy way) and move on.

				SR doesn&#039;t control a vendor&#039;s ratings.&nbsp; That is controlled by feedback received from buyers.&nbsp; Also, you can stop bitching about it any time now - as soon as the staff received complaints, they looked into it and banned the vendor.

				don&#039;t FE. I&#039;m new and have talked to 9 or 10 vendors. The ones who said &quot;no need to FE&quot; are the ones who got my business and all of them have came through with no issues. The ones who demanded FE did not and will not get my business.
