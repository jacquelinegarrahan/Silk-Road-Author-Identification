				Disclaimer: this wasn&#039;t my silk road nick :)<br /><br />Hi,<br />I feel like I have to say few words from myself.<br />Silk Road and you guys, UK Vendors, have changed my life. For many years I have thought I&#039;m getting fair service from people I know. A lot of times it was pure rip off by street dealers. <br />Then I decided to use Silk Road. I knew for quite some time it exists, I just wasn&#039;t brave enough to do it and try it. Which happened a month ago...<br />I used domestic Vendors for additional security.<br />I just want to say thank you so much guys for the greatest service I have ever seen in my life. Must add here that I am not some young fella and I did seen some stuff ;)<br />Your service and what Silk Road did is completely another level of existence for me. Simply amazing!<br />This is life changer. Never felt so good while buying strains, I could only read about or never even heard about. Again, Vendors were super helpful with any questions I had. <br />I feel like crying, it&#039;s gone!<br />Special thanks to UK GROW TEK for my last silk road delivery.<br />Your black kush really is special and thanks for a bit over of peruvian flake too. <br />I will use it wisely.<br />Thank you DPR and everyone else for doing this for us. i hope this is not the end of this great thing, I knew is missing in my life. FREEDOM!<br />&lt;3 <br />Th3 Cat<br />
