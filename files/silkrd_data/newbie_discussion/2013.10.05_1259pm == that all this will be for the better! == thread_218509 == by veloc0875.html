				hello all ! sorry I do not speak good English . I will not give my personal opinion on the person or powers that have closed silk road , I think we all think more or less the same, and not worth wasting time talking about them. all our energies must be focused on solutions , such as using the best encryption programs , and communicate only by that means ( do not use the website to send Messages ) . The heads of the websites that most of us have passed , have a responsibility to ensure the maximum security for sellers and buyers , and now! I think the web will get sufficient benefits to be up to date on the latest tools to ensure the best protection , both at the website itself and the sellers and buyers , such as to provide information to users about the best tools for protection and anonymity , and be updated constantly, and resort to more qualified people . do not forget that many people used this website, and used many others, and generating many capitals , uan small part of that has to be aimed at our maximum protection . these communications to be updated and to take the necessary mededidas , should always be produced under the highest seguirdad measures , if not, we are exposed to outsiders try to be at the same level or one step ahead , and finish with the web and not only that , but to gather information to pursue sellers and buyers. if the sites they see necessary, could charge a somewhat higher rate both sellers and buyers , so yes , that would go 100 % for the seguirdad , let us not forget what is most important! Or want to happen the same? say it is not good to work for the duration , or think , I guess it will be as safe as it should be , it is to do everything possible for this to be safe as far as possible and more . I even think I should have appointees , with responsibility, to take decisions and discuss about what steps to take . dealers even we could give our opinion and even vote on whether we agree or not on decisions made . always respecting the rules that protect freedom of those responsible for the web, the freedom of sellers and buyers. what happened to silk road of serbir should to strive to the fullest to turn around or improve many things , and be all protected everything you can and more . probably never be completely sure, but we do better against everything, but we try and more united we are , the harder they will tear down our barrier ! can not leave something so great in the hands of one person only , or protect with limited resources, so then what happens happens . is my humble opinion. I hope it will take things much more seriously. if not I fear the day will come that neither sellers nor buyers trust in these places . would give me grief that happen , here there is freedom ! nothing I say has to do with politics, or any other movement , do not believe in them, just believe in my right to decide for myself. but the organization in need ! seize to change things ! not mean to sound smarter or lead anything , just want us all to be united and strive together to make everything the best it can for everyone! are already doing this work and efforts! Thanks to all who haceis this possible, and apply all whatever you need to make changes or improvements needed ! Greetings and see you ! veloc
