				Remarkably, the number of vendors has increased in line with the number of mailbox master keys that have been sold. I wonder how far prices will drop?

				Don&#039;t rely on price drop here in Australia. If you do you could die before you see any improvement on pricing that will encourage you. Local vendors ask ridiculous high prices it is up to the buyer whether to pay or order from OS in which risk increases and postage times are not reliable. Your decison.

				Prices have dropped a little around where I&#039;m at - but still ridiculous. Down from $1000/gram to 6 or 7 hunge. <br /><br />But assholes like infinite source listing &#039;sent to Australia in envelope&#039; , don&#039;t help our cause of getting decent priced gear through customs.<br /><br />Has anyone had any AoD arrive down here yet? So eager for some decent priced, decent gear, I got it shipped express. Hope that don&#039;t mean extra scrutiny, but got ripped by I.S, so running dry :&#039;(

Speed means different things in different countries. Some places it means base, others it means powder, while in Australia it could mean real amphetamines salt or meth.

Nah, I usually only buy from Kush ( is he still on holiday? ) , <br /><br />Hammertime ( Although he says he&#039;ll only send full ounces to Aus now, which leaves me fucked ) <br /><br />FirstClassFix ( who is a fucken champ. He doesn&#039;t usually ship to Aus, but if u catch him at the right time he definitely will - FE though until trust is established ) and more recently<br /><br />AoD. - Ordered a gram first up that was great, but then got a 1/2 oz which one of his crew had fucked up and packaged whilst still extremely wet. Acetone ate through one of the layers of vac seal so lucky his stealth was great. I found little bits of black fibre ( when I asked him he apologized and said it was cat hair - fucken yuck to smoke ) Had another on the way already which is heaps better, however, I have a mate who is a dealer, and what AoD sends him , and what I have received are very fucking far from each other in terms of quality.<br />&nbsp;My mate has received some lovely shards which are downright just fucking awesome.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have brought these concerns up with AoD, although if you&#039;ve seen his page &quot;SOME SHIT WENT DOWN&#039; last week, and he&#039;s been busy. So depending on the reaction I get from him and if he replaces the product or not, will determine if I ever purchase from him again. I didn&#039;t mention any of this in my feedback and still gave 5 out of 5 cos I didn&#039;t want to seem like some blackmailing fuck out for freebies, although the more days that go by, the less confident I am in the fuck up being corrected.&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:(<br /><br />REALLY KEEN TO KNOW WHERE THESE AUSSIE NAMES ADDRESSES AND WHAT THEY ORDERED ARE POSTED, IF SOMEONE COULD POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I WOULD BE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL&nbsp; &nbsp;:) :)<br /><br />

				It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve touched meth, and I&#039;ve never bought it from SR. <br /><br />What&#039;s the quality difference like between Aust &amp; SR venders abroad?
