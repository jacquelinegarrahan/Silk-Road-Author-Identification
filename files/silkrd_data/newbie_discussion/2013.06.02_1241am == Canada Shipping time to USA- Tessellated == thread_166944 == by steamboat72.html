				What is the shipping time from Canada to USA?&nbsp; Letter from Tessellated was marked as shipped May 24 and has been at least 7 postal days in transit. I wouldn&#039;t mind normally but I&#039;ve seen things getting to Europe on other posts in four days.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s well hidden packaging, etc but I&#039;m the only one controlling the mail and VERY carefully going through everything that has come in. Junk mail or not.&nbsp; So I know I haven&#039;t thrown anything away or have been careless.&nbsp; Anyone know if this is normal shipping time?

				I had an international usps express package take more than two weeks. Nothing is guaranteed international IME, I&#039;ve seen stuff from EU arrive twice as fast as crossing said national border can take.<br /><br />Tessellated looks to be a good vendor with good packaging etc. so just sit tight dude. You shouldn&#039;t have anything to worry about.

				I had several parcels of mail delivered from Vancouver to US (east coast) took 6-7 days (each) counting weekends. I ordered mid-week, arrived mid-week.<br />Shipping times vary, I expect this to be the fastest delivery for regular international mail from that area.

				I had a non-SR related package from Hong Kong take almost Two months to clear customs, from a legitimate business who has gotten me other items in less then a work week. And ive had an SR letter of NBOMe from RUSSIA make it in 4 days. Customs has their head so far up their own ass you can never tell, but i could recommend going domestic with your orders to help reduce this. USPS still fucks around a lot but much more consistent about it and much less risk involved.

				So glad I found this, I placed an order exactly a week ago and still nothing.&nbsp; My house gets so much mail so im constantly checking everything so carefully esp since tes told me how the package looks but my gpa crashed and i havent re set it.&nbsp; I will admit i am getting anxious since i also placed 5 different orders all withing 3 days.&nbsp; Guess I went a lil crazy there. I hope it comes soon!

				Been two weeks since shipment (roughly 9 business days not including memorial day) and still no arrival. He&#039;s already offered a 50 percent discount but I&#039;m still holding out. . .

				It took mine 8 days to get to me, the stealth is perfect and will not get noticed so if its taking long its just the mail being slow. Other people it has taken longer. I think he only ships out on certain days.

				Why call it quits? It&#039;s not unheard of that an international letter takes a month to arrive. Take an extension and hang tight.

				It&#039;s officially been three weeks since shipment date.&nbsp; The USA is right next door. No way it&#039;s coming. I guess it got confiscated or returned to sender. I put real name and address. I took no bullshit shortcuts. I&#039;m so pissed right now.&nbsp; One week in I was nervous, two anxious/scared/ now I&#039;m just fucking pissed.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s some shit now that all I get is a 50% refund.&nbsp; Not blaming him but that doesn&#039;t make me feel better at all.&nbsp; So think it&#039;s alright to give up on it?&nbsp; Nothing I can think of at this point.
