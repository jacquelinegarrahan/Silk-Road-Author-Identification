				Is it possible?<br /><br />I live in OZ and to buy BC&#039;s I need to go to the bank and deposit money into an account. Fuck that, lol<br /><br />Even MtGox requires you to verify your identity to purchase them.<br /><br />So, where do you guys buy them, anonymously? Or is that even possible/needed?<br /><br />Cheers

				I dealt with a place that was cash by mail.&nbsp; It was risky but anonymous .&nbsp; The bank deposit system isn&#039;t that bad.&nbsp; They shouldn&#039;t ask for ID or anything.&nbsp; There are a couple reputable vendors in the money section on SR that do cash by mail or bank deposit for BTC.&nbsp; Just be careful they have long history of good feedback.

				Thanks for your reply.<br /><br />Would the bank option just mean I go in with cash and say give money to this person? How do I prove to the seller that it was me that sent him that money?
