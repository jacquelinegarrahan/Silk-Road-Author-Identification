				Nothing is &quot;necessary&quot;. That&#039;s an arbitrary determination. If you&#039;re asking if it reduces your footprint, then absolutely yes it does. Significantly? That&#039;s for you to decide.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t look at the thread, but based on your question, that setup would limit all of your &#039;dirty&#039; data to a USB stick and destroy all temporary information by design and ensure that all connections were properly routed securely and would fail if they weren&#039;t.

				right well that all seems like a lot of work to me and I&#039;d have no idea what I&#039;d be doing.<br /><br />Maybe a better question would be - is this common practice here?

				Just go with the flow man....<br /><br />Do as much as your able to/willing to cause I have never heard of someone wishing they hadn&#039;t used so much stealth/precautions but I have heard more than once...<br /><br /><br />&quot;oh i wish I&#039;d been more careful..... I miss shitting with a door that&#039;s closed, showering on my own and not being raped every other night by Darnel and Hecter on the other nights.. :-(&quot;<br /><br />or some equally tragic and depressing from dude facing down real time for fake crimes..<br /><br />personally I have shit locked down... encryption, both hardware and software, VM, even a &#039;panic box&#039; which is a box that I can throw all the SR/drug shit, hdds, gear etc, in and after a 2 stage activation (had to be 2 but its still a quick process) the contents of the box are rendered.... messed the fuck up... its not fun knowing the cops are breaking your door down but the the 30 seconds you have isn&#039;t enough to flush/destroy the shit you know they will find so this gives me peace of mind and a final get out of jail free card.. if i&#039;m quick enough that is...

				found this post<br /><br />for securing a macbook i suggest using a bootable live operating system.<br />There are operating systems preconfigured for TOR that are really easy to use and come with handy tools like pgp pre-installed. On shut down the system wipes your ram and leaves no trace of activity.<br /><br />The Amnesic Incognito Live System - Tails, is one of those systems that runs fine on a Macbook.<br /><br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Download the current version @ https://tails.boum.org/<br /><br />2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burn the ISO image onto a DVD<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insert blank DVD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open &quot;Disk Utility&quot; (OSX feature)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the &quot;File&quot; Menu click on &quot;Open Disk Image...&quot; and choose the Tails ISO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ISO will now appear in the lower part of the left column<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Select the image there and click on the atomic &quot;Burn&quot; icon in the top left corner and burn to the DVD with slow speed (2x/4x)<br /><br />3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you restart your Macbook with the DVD inserted wait for the screen to get white and immediately press and hold the alt button until you reach the bootloader. Navigate to the DVD entry labeled &quot;Windows&quot; and press enter.<br /><br /><br />Voil√°! You are now ready to go. Network drivers, Touchpad, etc. all supported by default.<br /><br />You also have the option to insert a Thumbdrive and clone the system to it via&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Applications - System Tools - Tails USB Installer<br />This will give you the option to create a persistent Volume (e.g. save files, pgp keys) and will work much faster than a DVD.<br />Although booting from a USB drive is not possible with the default apple bootloader you can download and install rEFIt from you OSX, which will recognize the drive.<br />rEFIt: http://refit.sourceforge.net/<br /><br /><br />hope that helped :)<br /><br />Guess I&#039;ll try this

I mean why not?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Its so very true...<br /><br />&nbsp;look like a tin foil hat wearing twitcher the 999 times nothing goes wrong and you have gone to lengths to be secure ... but feel like the boss the 1 time shit does go down and you are covered by being so precise with the security...<br /><br />I can only say to stay fervent with your dedication to security and flying under the radar with this stuff cause the 999 times may take .. oh say 15 odd years to happen and that 1 might be right there when you have lost the fire and lapsed your security... Unfortunately when you go from being someone who will never see freedom again if you get caught to a nobody buyer and general derp and you have been living the knifes edge for so long it seems like you never had a day of not being all over it you can get lulled into a false sense of security.. who knew the fucks I was trying to educate about being safe would be the ones to lead the investigation right to my , now loose, frond door.. <br /><br />Its something to be aware of... we all buy our drugs from someone.. most have access to a low or mid level distribution branch but some have a access that&#039;s higher on the ladder (double entendre like a boss!) but the thing common to all drug users is the chain/ladder goes up to someone.. and does so again and again. my point is that you mayb be of no interest, even your dude may be a nobody but at some point the step up the ladder leads to someone who is very sought after by the LEO of this world... so being a weak link in the chain, even the last link, can open a world of hurt on you from LE and also from those on the higher parts of the ladder who think its&nbsp; fairly annoying that they spend so much time being careful only to have some tweaker bring them undone through silly little mistakes or lazy attitude towards being safe.. <br /><br />&nbsp;Again may never come up as an issue.. but if it does... yeah that&#039;s the sort of lucjk I would have I think... 1 in a billion chance I get ones in my life and no its not Powerball I get... its Hector, a black leather bag, a shipping container and a long... long... long night that I get. Actually I am very blessed in alot of ways but the point is still valid... <br /><br />:-P
