				I lost my virginity on a roll. That&#039;s the only time I&#039;ve ever combined hard drugs and sex, sadly. I even remember the tab. It was a yellow Y2K (showing my age, lol). My girlfriend refused to dose, so I took hers. What followed can only be described as a (from what I can remember) very slow, sensual 6-hour single session. Amps usually give me limp-dick, but somehow I had a halfie that raged all night. I might be off on the time, but I swear we were screwing and/or soaking (gotta rest) the entire time. I can&#039;t speak for how good it was for her, but she continued to allow me access for several years into the future. Since then, I&#039;ve only had one GF that was cool with my toking, and I miss intoxicated sex. We&#039;ll see what the future holds. I&#039;m holding out for a stoner chick this time. We&#039;ll see if I can last...&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;ve heard from a number of people that they have mind-blowing sex on coke.&nbsp; My own experience is that if I do enough coke to really qualify as a &quot;binge,&quot; my erotic imagination runs rampant but my dick barely works at all.&nbsp; While that does limit the options, any lesbian could tell you that it doesn&#039;t slam the door altogether.<br /><br />If I use coke very very sparingly, the dick still works fine and orgasm is somewhat enhanced.<br /><br />All kinds of psychedelics make for great hugs and general physical closeness, but they also interfere with goal-driven behavior in general.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that they make penetrative sex impossible, they just provide abundant distractions from it.

				Best sex in the world is with Meth - but only if you slam (IV) it.&nbsp; There&#039;s no more intense sexual feeling than a good shot of dope.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost an instant orgasm for men.&nbsp; Back in the day when I was really green to drugs, and especially needles, the only thing that made me try it was watching one girl give another girl a shot - she was laying in the bed, nude, and had a g-spot squirting orgasm to the end of the bed, nearly, and immediately de-clothed me and the two of them rocked my world, porn star style.&nbsp; I can say that when your on that shit, IVly, it&#039;ll make you get into some shit you normally wouldn&#039;t do.&nbsp; And it&#039;ll last a few hours.&nbsp; If you shoot coke, it&#039;s comparable, but ya gotta keep shooting it about every 30 mins or so, b/c it doesn&#039;t last long at all - which, in turn, can KILL you - so, it&#039;s certainly not recommended - but then again, Im not recommending anyone shoot meth either.&nbsp; It&#039;s an experience, I will say that.&nbsp;

				Sex on weed is good as long as Im not too stoned and I have had sex on most of the drugs I have taken at one time or another.&nbsp; Sometimes this is good, sometimes bad and sometimes indifferent MDMA makes me not cum but have nice long sensual loving stuff.<br /><br />With shrooms and acid its been both awesome (in the forest, midsummer, under the stars...wow) and shit (at a party, thinking i had puked on my gf and trying to scrape it off!!) depending on the head scene at the time (like so much with hard tripping its never quite predictable)<br /><br />My worst sex experience with a drug was on alcohol.....<br /><br />My best was with 2-CB, me and my gf spent an evening on a 20mg dose each each doing every imaginable thing we had sooo much fun and we both had no probs cumming, it was superbly filthy!!&nbsp; I would recommend 2-CB at moderate dose for a special fuck....<br />

				sex on drugs is the best! :D and almost all drugs makes sex more interesting! Psychedelics can make it a bit hard to focus and stay turned on, if you are having some crazy hallucinations :D<br /><br />my favorites drugs to have sex are:<br /><br />amfetamine<br />or<br />cocaine + GHB<br />mdma is also ok, but its hard to cum, and that&#039;s pretty annoying! :D

				I have to say that sex on GHB is great, and also on MDMA. And poppers are a great enhancer too, particularly combined with other hard drugs! Poppers are a great potentiator of MDMA, GHB, ketmaine, mushrooms... not only during sex, but when dancing or tripping! However, it is hard to find good quality ones nowadays. Personally, I think Amyl and butyl nitrite are the best, but stay away from isopropyl nitrite based poppers, many of which come from the UK.
