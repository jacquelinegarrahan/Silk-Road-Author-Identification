				Hello.<br /><br />&nbsp;I was wondering if it was within vendor parameters to let buyers know their package has arrived at the postal facility, to give them a heads up etc..<br /><br />Is this common? (currently asked my vendor for that, but no reply yet. Dont know if im overstepping or not.)<br /><br />Thanks

				Depends entirely on delivery method- some tracked delivery services can tell you where the package is right down the the depot involved, when it&#039;s on the van to be delivered e.t.c<br /><br />

				totally misread the question, sorry!<br /><br /><br />The vendor changes the order status to &quot;in transit&quot; when they post it.

				Yes but I was wondering if the vendor ever contacts the buyer to let them know the package has arrived (via tracking number online) at the local postal center?

				you can let them know it has arrived, but don&#039;t get them the tracking number unless 10 days have gone by.... my 2 cents.

				i feel you on the not knowing when shit will arrive... i been trying to get up and goin on the road... but its not easy.. gotta get bitcoins, wait days for shipment... its kinda a hassle... but if i can get this going its gonna be worth it.. i mean there no way SR could get all my business.. the delay in shipping just kills that... maybe is someone out there sent overnight and didnt have a people with putting like 2 in a box and would send like 3 boxes a week to the different places i have lined up to accept packages... then SR might get like half my biz<br /><br />i wouldnt need a tracking number... i just would like a &quot;hey... watch out on------------&quot; that would be all i needed
