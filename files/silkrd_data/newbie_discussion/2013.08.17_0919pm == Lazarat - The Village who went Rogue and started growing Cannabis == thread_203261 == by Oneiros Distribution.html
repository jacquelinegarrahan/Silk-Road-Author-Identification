				Saw this amusing article on reddit recently, Europe’s marijuana capital isn’t Amsterdam: http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/130815/europe-marijuana-capital-lazarat-albania<br /><br />For those not wanting to read the whole thing, this is basically what it&#039;s about:<br /><br />&quot;Drugs traffickers have taken advantage of a political power vacuum during the formation of a government following national elections in June to invest large funds in the fields this year.&quot; A village of 5000 + people decided it would be a good idea growing Cannabis everywhere, and so they did. With the massive amount of money they made from it they&#039;ve bought heavy weaponry including anti-tank missiles and will stop any police attempting to cut down or burn down their crop. Police got attacked big time in their last attempt to remove the growing operation and has decided they will not attempt to remove it without the government making an official decision to remove it - something that would most likely require the army as there would be thousands of casualties in that case as basically the entire village is involved in some way.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Now my description might simplify the situation a bit as everyone there aren&#039;t exactly saints as they appear to deal with human trafficking, but the concept of a small village gaining so much power they&#039;re able to tell the government to Fuck Off and that they&#039;re better off without them is priceless.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />For another interesting article on the village: http://inserbia.info/news/2013/08/albania-village-of-lazarat-annually-produces-900-tons-of-marijuana-video/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">To those who export the marijuana, it is sold at a price of 500 euros. For larger groups, which have motor boats, and smuggle marijuana into Greece and Italy, the price is 800 euros per kilo.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Albania where the village resides has a chance of entering the European Union in December 2013: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Albania_to_the_European_Union
