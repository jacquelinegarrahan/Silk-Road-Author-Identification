				It&#039;s all in how you approach it. Don&#039;t tell anyone but Modziw has been known to help out a newb.<br /><br />He has Provigil which is like a cup of coffee that lasts all day.<br /><br />I think I have a link to his store here somewhere...<br /><br />Oh, here it is:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/14845f6687<br /><br />Read his profile first.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br /><br />Modzi

				There are several sellers who do not require new buyers to FE. Most sellers will state whether or not they require early finalization in their profiles.

				make it a habit to read vendor profiles. i&#039;ve found everything i need to know just by reading up. if you&#039;re still not sure about the vendors newbie policy or just want to double check; shoot the vendor a message (read their profile to also see if they prefer pgp form).

				yes it&#039;s very possible, I&#039;am new here and was not asked to FE.<br /><br />Read vendor&#039;s profiles, I&#039;ve already marked a lot of them who don&#039;t require FE, some are asking you to NEVER FE !<br /><br />For me it&#039;s a very good sign. <br /><br />As a newbie I think it&#039;s important to get in touch with the seller with a pm, my stats are not speaking for me so I need to introduce myself.

				Yes it is like all said very much possible. It is very sad many beginners think they must FE their first transactions. Scammers know this fact and exploit it good. Never FE!<br /><br />When a vendor write &quot;trust me or dont buy from me&quot; ALWAYS CHOOSE DONT BUY!!! NEVER CHOOSE TO TRUST ANONYMOUS CASH HUNGRY SELLER WITH YOUR MONEY!!!

				I&#039;ve never Finalized Early and don&#039;t understand why anyone would really. The only reason I can think of is if you&#039;ve done business with the vendor for a long time and you trust them to come through on their end. But still the big boys don&#039;t need to have cash in hand because they already have product in stock so they aren&#039;t fronting you anything.

				thanks for the advice there people, looks like we have a mix bag.<br /><br />I think I will take a calculated risk and buy real small off a &#039;trusted&#039;<br />vendor, a lot of the ones in uk who don&#039;t ask for FE,<br />don&#039;t have as good deals...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				What about double checking the vendor that asks FE? Not only feedback profile (ok, it maybe faked) but also searching on the forum for reviews,asking previous customers...<br />And at last buying something of small value,not above 50$
