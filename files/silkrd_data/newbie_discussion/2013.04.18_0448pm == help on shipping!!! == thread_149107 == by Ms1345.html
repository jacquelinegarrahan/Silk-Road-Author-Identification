				I need to send a package to Belgium and one to Australia with a gram of cocaine each.&nbsp; I am using vaccum sealing three times and MBB twice. Then I&#039;m putting gift wrap over that. So I&#039;m good on the security part<br /><br />I just have no idea how to actually ship it. On USPS website it was saying 95$ to send to Australia for less than an ounce package. That can&#039;t be right. Someone help me out here. I want to use stamps if possible.<br /><br />Thanks

The guy said he is sending some coke to two people. He didnt offer anything to anyone.<br />Your security sounds great good luck, wish I could help. Read through the shipping section. <br /><br />Seriously man dont say shit like your gonna go to jail, you&#039;ll scare the newbies.<br /><br />Chaos<br /><br />

How do you ship your items? I doubt you tripple vac then double MBB, then gift wrap your items. He definitely is sending it more secure then anyone else that sells on the road. So yes I&#039;m telling him to go for it, there is more of a chance of you fucking up then him with the method he posted. <br /><br />Again, if your going to fearmonger someone, at least read their whole post first.<br /><br />Ms1345, your security is fine, just make sure to double up on gloves.<br /><br />Chaos

Like that he isn&#039;t allowed to post this, or that he can&#039;t vend without an account even tho he said nothing of doing that. Or the fact that his shipping method is way overkill in the security department so he has no reason to worry. <br /><br />I have shipped many items domestically and I still don&#039;t know how to ship internationally so either help the guy or get the fuck out of here,<br /><br />Chaos

				And then northstars deletes his idiotic posts. If anyone wants to see what he posted just check where I quoted him. <br /><br />Iv said it many times before on here, do not scare newbies, it&#039;s like people just get some kick out of scarring newbies and fucking with them wrongly.

				Ha , nobody wants to get involved .&nbsp; Good move. <br /><br />Good consultation is never free , only opinions from people who always have one.<br /><br /><br />Jesus, just read the shipping thread already.&nbsp; &nbsp;Double vac seal, heavy food grade, then toss in a anti-static MBB bag.&nbsp; Put inside an envelope and inside a bigger one in case the first one gets ripped. <br /><br />This is far better then most of everything I&#039;ve ever received from here. Very few use the MBB anti-static bags.&nbsp; Nothing gets through those.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m no expert but at&nbsp; least I provided something.
