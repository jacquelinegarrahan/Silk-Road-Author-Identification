				I just FE&#039;d for a vendor (don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s a small amount, this is beyond the point) and want to know if I leave feedback now, can I go back and edit it?&nbsp; Am I better off just not filling out the feedback for 2 week, so when I fill it out it auto-populates to the front of the list as it should?<br /><br />I want to make sure I do this right.
