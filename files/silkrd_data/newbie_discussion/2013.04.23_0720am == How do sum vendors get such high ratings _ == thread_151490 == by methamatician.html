				I would like to know why certain vendors are able to show over 300+ transactions,99.3% positive reviews/feedback,when clearly they should not have anywhere near those stats.There are a few that i am aware off where just the few transactions they screwed me in should have lowered there stats,and when i read theyre feedback there seems to always be a few others like me,that have been screwed.<br />Somehow though these vendors never seem to have lowered stats and are allowed to continue on their merry way :-\&nbsp;

				300+ can mean an infinity. It has to do with tha fact that some popular vendors has so many transactions in total that one or two or even many more negative scores are&nbsp; insignificant to the avarage.

				I used to respect mimm and his vendor style but lately have only heard bad things about him , I will show I&#039;m not a scammer by offering individual listings at good prices for people to test out , hopefully the domestic market is ready for a good domestic vendor!

I have been able to avoid using this vendor cos something about him just didnt sit right.Seriously how can you be at 94% and still rank in the top 1% of sellers? That just doesnt add up for me.Currently i am in the resolutin center after he was granted 14 extra days to get his product to me,i have bought off vendors on here that would get that item to me 3 times within that extension of 2 weeks,an thats being conservative.<br />I may be wrong about the guy,i&#039;m just speaking of my own personal transaction and other reviews i have read about this guy/girl,can anybody tell me of a good experience with this vendor ?

				Every vendor with high stats has never screwed me.&nbsp; Maybe your standards and expectations are set too high.&nbsp; But its like that any place, pick the time of the month imo.

Last of all i never said all vendors with high stats,just this particular one.

				Some of the stats have been obscured for security reasons. So leo cannot count the actual amount of transactions.
