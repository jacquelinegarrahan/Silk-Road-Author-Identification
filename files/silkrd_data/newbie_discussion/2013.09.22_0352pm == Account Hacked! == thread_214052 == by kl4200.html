				My account was hacked with very little bitcoins in it but I had 4 active orders still in the processing stage.&nbsp; I step up a new account and messaged the vendors asking them not to cancel the orders or change the shipping address (in case who ever hacked my account messaged them to do so).&nbsp; I just herd back from one of the vendors and he said it sounds fishy and thinks he&#039;ll cancel the order (understandably).&nbsp; I told him it will probably auto-finalize and I&#039;ll give him and extra .15 BTC for the trouble.&nbsp; Did I do the right thing? and who do I talk to to make sure the vendors get their BTC?
