				Hello There,<br /><br />I just want to warn you about the Habits of CrystalMethCat. <br /><br />1. He seems to have an Problem stamping his Letters sufficient enough. There is no better Way to attract unwanted Attention, cause in most Countrys the Postal Services will open the Letter in the Process of resending.<br /><br />2. He has an really big Problem with Stealth. Means: No (Zero, 0) Stealth at all.<br /><br />3. The &quot;No Communication Situation&quot;. On his Vendor Info he states that he never will answer Messages an&nbsp; &nbsp;when someone has to get in Contact with him he should add an certain Item and write the Message in the Address Field. Sadly the Item isn´t listed. So there is NO (Zero, 0 again^^) Way to get into Contact with him.<br /><br /><br />My Order is underway for 7 (!) Days Domnestic, no Communication no nothing....<br /><br />Here are a few Examples of His Doings:<br /><br />this vendor methods are incredibly crappy and very amatuer (unprofessional way) if u are to place an order with this vendor u are expect to go to the post office and pick up the letter everytime!!! is this guy a joke or what?? its highly risky for customers!!! STAY AWAY from placing order with this vendor. if u wanted to get caught by going to the post office to collect it. GOOD LUCK! this vendor are really STUPID ever i seen on SR! god, this vendor might think he is very professional in all of this, i assured u he is not!!<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Be cautious people..<br />Purchase made September 7 and nothing yet - this is a lot of time for a DOMESTIC.<br /><br />I had a letter in my mail box today, that I have to go to the post office - could be something else, of course...but if it isn&#039;t, this would be the most unprofessional vendor I&#039;ve had so far.<br />And if not - wheres my order? :/<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I&#039;m the same idiot :(<br />got ripped off !!!!!!!<br />Don&#039;t know how he&#039;s got 4.9 ???<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />so...it took 8 days for delivery, mainly because the sending was poststamped incorrectly, so I had to go to the Post Office and collect the letter whilst paying an additional 1,41€ fee, you guys all know that if i would not have been able to collect it there inbetween some days I wouldve been in trouble cause german post opens letters in order to determine its origin.<br />Product: Weight is alright my scale says 4.05 ...but quality is at most 3/5 this is peace you can buy nextdoor too, so not really worth the current price.<br /><br />I took a picture of the incoorect poststamp envelope so if sbdy needs proof i hav it...I also wrote Crystalmethcat yesterday to inform him/her that there will be a bad review incoming...ofc no reaction....and his &quot;communication object&quot; thsat you add to the cart is a dead link, so figure it out yourself <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Domestic letter was not stamped sufficient, arrived in 4 days anyhow. Basically no stealth, but a good vacuum pack, alright for domestic.<br />Cocain was alright, but not good. Weight as promised.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Order never arrived, vendor don&#039;t want customers to get in contact via message or mail, so I don&#039;t know how to react in this situation. I don&#039;t want to use the resolve function because of the small amount I ordered. Don&#039;t want to ruin my good status ;)<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps to warn People....

				I have ordered from him yes....and still waiting (8 Days domnestic an he said he put it in Transit 12. September).<br />I wrote him 3 Messages (PM) and 1 EMail on his provided Adresses....no Answer.<br /><br />And I´m not the only one:<br /><br />oh oh oh.....not again.<br /><br />I had the same with the seller &quot;High Voltage&quot; a few weeks ago. Luckily SR Admins released my BTCs but had no fun for 3 weekends and lose 10% of the money.<br /><br />Hopefully CMC is really back in business and our stuff is on the way.....in that case get well soon. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Well - I was at the post office today and the letter was something else. So still no sign of my order (day 10 - domestic). Great. Will contact the vendor, but I dont have much hope here. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________
