				Dude, that is... shocking... it&#039;s way past the usual dose. I mean, people in serious mental trouble take 40mg PER DAY over the course of a day (4x 10mg). If you&#039;re taking 100mg and nothing is happening, then one of two scenarios are happening:<br /><br />1. The drugs are bad or old<br />2. You&#039;ve built such a high tolerance to benzos that you&#039;re in serious danger of dependency<br /><br />2 is unlikely if you&#039;ve really gone months without it or any other benzo.

				Nothing wrong with drugs unfortunately, I know the doses are ridiculous but it was just my drug of<br />choice I guess, because it&#039;s legal I kind of made myself think its ok. But in saying that my Doctor who<br />is a specialist was saying he had a client who took close to 80 serapax a day.<br /><br />Im really upset that this tolerance is going to last forever, they are a beautiful pharmaceutical.<br />I wonder if Rohypnol would have not effect on me either seeing its a benzo

				I was on a lot of benzos through chemo, a lot of ativan, some xanax and valium, and then a LOT of versed with having medical procedures every time I turned around.&nbsp; I developed quite a tolerance that I STILL have, and that was several years ago..&nbsp; There are several medical procedures that I fully remember because they got to a point where they couldnt give me any more, the worst was a bronoscopy..&nbsp; i have no idea if that is spelled right.&nbsp; The tolerance is beginning to subside, but its still there - I had minor surgery a few months ago where they twilighted me with versed.&nbsp; I dont remember the procedure, but they did mention the doses they were using were almost maxed out per the recommendations for my weight.<br />I keep ativan around by legal rx, but even at 5-10mg (which of course is no where near your dose, but I am several years removed from when I was on the most benzos) its really only taking the edge off a panic attack.

				Thanks kittiesandpuppies, your the first person I&#039;ve come across that understands. Most people think Im full of shit when I tell them the<br />doses but it&#039;s literaaly like your body is not affected by them what soever. It&#039;s not even like Heroin addiction where you feel low and it brings you back up to normal, I feel absolutely nothing I might as well be eating Vitamin C.<br /><br />Well it sounds like you have got some of your ability to notice benzo&#039;s again , that gives me hope.<br />For you benzo uses just a little pointer, t make your benzo dose more amplified, add Clonidine, 150-300. I don&#039;t know the chemistry behind<br />it but later in my benzo abuse my doctor prescribed it for that exact purpose and it does work. I would say it adds about 25%&nbsp; your benzo<br />hit.
