				Unprovable fact thread you say? Sure!<br /><br />Abstract objects like mathematical objects (e.g. numbers, sets) and propositions are real, independent entities that exist in reality. <br /><br />Properties are not necessarily or only particulars nor are they like tropes, they are universals first and foremost.<br /><br />Moral beliefs are justifiable a priori and at least some moral beliefs are epistemic-ly justified. In other words, there likely do exist objective moral truths unlike what the so-called intellectuals and their swine in contemporary society would have us believe.<br /><br />Time actually is a constant, there is actually no direct contradiction between special relativity and this notion; the problem is that the time in physics, i.e. the measurement of change, is not really &#039;time&#039; at all. So time dilation should be renamed to something like speed dilation.<br /><br />Mental states are not reducible to brain states or any relevant physical states in general. There is a fundamental divide between subject and object that creates an explanatory gap that cannot be closed. Intentional content and qualia cannot be &#039;objectively&#039; accounted for other than speaking in their own terms, and any reduction to something simpler is just an arbitrary move to sustain the intellectual bandwagon that is naturalism. (I am not a theist or anything, I just think naturalism is entirely the wrong response to the instrumental successes of science.)<br /><br />Empiricism is an ill-defined philosophy that, in its modern forms, needs to equivocate between multiple definitions of analycity. As for the radical empiricism advocated by Quine, it&#039;s entirely self-defeating. Laurence Bonjour in his book &quot;In Defense of Pure Reason&quot; provides the most clear-headed, decisive, weighty, and assured refutation of this na√≠ve tradition.<br /><br />Contra-Wittgenstein, philosophy is not largely composed of unnoticed language games and riddles.<br /><br />Contra-idiots, metaphysics is not some supernatural or superfantastical study - rather, it&#039;s like &quot;describing physics&quot; or &quot;about physics&quot;.<br /><br />The denial of autonomous free will is self-refuting because it absents any coherent notion for an agent&#039;s internal reasoning. That is, to deny free will presupposes that the premises and beliefs that lead you to that conclusion are at least justified - but if the propositional content of your beliefs are not determined by your autonomous will or reasoning, then you are faced with the most severe threat of the cosmic coincidence and thus any and all of your beliefs are hopelessly unlikely to be accidental true, or even objectively coherent!<br /><br /><br /><br />
