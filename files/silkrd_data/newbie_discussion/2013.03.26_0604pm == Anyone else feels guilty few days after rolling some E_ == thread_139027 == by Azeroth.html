				Everyone, eventually. I stopped that drug about 10 yrs ago, everyone I used to do it with quit eventually because of the midweek horrors.

				I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever gotten a guilty feeling. After a good roll my brain just feels &quot;used up&quot; for a couple of days. I just don&#039;t have the processing power that I usually do, that&#039;s all.

				I get that guilty feeling when I wake up after a big night drinking and the end of it is a blur or blackout.<br /><br />I may not have done anything wrong at all but it is the non-memory of it that has me stressed.<br /><br />Best thing to do is take some nurofen or something stronger, drink lots of water and go back to bed. Dont go to work.<br /><br />As for E, yes the &#039;crash&#039; a few days after tends to get worse as you get older, in my experience. So frequency of use becomes less and less.

				The midweek molly blues are never pleasant, but I stopped taking MDMA when the sadness came with the peak. I would just start feeling so isolated from everyone around me, it was the complete opposite of the sociable function it would serve in the past. Ultimately I don&#039;t miss it too much, the best things about MDMA were the social situations it lead me to during a pretty formative time in my life. I&#039;ll still take an E pill at a show once in a while for the miscellaneous speed that&#039;s in it, if I&#039;m not planning on being very productive the next day.

				I always tried to get into the habit of doing it on a Friday night, rather than a Saturday, so at least I&#039;d have some extra, proper, sleep before going back to the rat race.
