				I agree it is difficult for Bitcoin to recover to previous highs after today&#039;s action. A dip to just above 40 (from 54) destroyed a lot of confidence to this rally. Just my technical point of view.

				This weekend I planned to sink £500 into BTC. Was going to buy them last night but ended up getting drunk instead and put it off. Glad I did since they&#039;ve fallen in the last 24 hours.<br /><br />My stats on the Road are $666.6 spent in six months (not sure I like all those sixes!). Figured that I should stock up on BTC and whatever I bought this weekend should cover my day to day purchases over the next six months and any future rises in that period would be a nice bonus.<br /><br />Still going to do it but the question now is when to buy? They&#039;re currently around the £40 mark. Most people are expecting them to rise further over the course of the next few months but as far as right now is concerned will we see them dip back into the £30&#039;s again?<br /><br />So question to everyone. If you had £500 to blow on BTC what would you do and when?

				It seems the people buying are mostly buying slow in small chunks regularly over a number of days. The people selling are selling in large chunks, quickly all at once. Pro&#039;s vs. Panic ? Impossible to guess on a short term buy but long term btc still look good.<br /><br />

				My advice to you is only but btc when you want to buy something at this point.&nbsp; If your thinking of making money the oppurtunity has passed sorry.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see its at 62 right now its going to drop and its not going back up like it did.&nbsp; I have a BS in CIS and Econmics but use drugs so I&#039;m not all that stupid.&nbsp; Was working got layed off.&nbsp; But will be working again in this field pretty soon.&nbsp; So I no this shit

				That is true.&nbsp; But your lookin at something more condensed than this.&nbsp; What I mean is as long there is a market for BTC it will be recognized as a currency.&nbsp; As soon as the narket&nbsp; has no need for BTC than it will completly go to shit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been readin that BTC are used now alot for legal stuff don&#039;t know why but thats why its worth was on the rise
