				Hey guys! Relatively new to SR though I&#039;m excited to get involved. I ordered a 2CB cap (25mg) and some tabs of 25-NBOMe (1100ug each). I&#039;ve not done psychedelics before, and realize these substances aren&#039;t best suited for greenbacks like me. I&#039;d like to know if you guys could offer me some advice as I begin dabbling with these substances. Which would you recommend using first? Would you discourage the use of either of these substances in deference to shrooms? Leave feedback and I&#039;ll let you know how it goes when I sample it. I&#039;m leaning towards 2CB, and will no doubt eventually pick up some cubensis soon. Thanks!

				i would go with the nbome first but just because you could start off with a half a tab or whatever if you wanted, but idk I never dove straight into RC&#039;s as my first psychadelic experience, but its all about headspace and your environment, as long as you dont take a crazy huge ass dose and have a positive headspace and environment you should have a great time =)

				I will probably take a full tab, though I know I can take less. I&#039;m feeling pretty good and anticipate a pleasant trip. Thanks for the tips! :) I&#039;m still interested to hear what other people might think about my plan, too.

				hell yeah if they are 1000 mics, i can honstly tell you when i made my own 25I-NBOMe blotters i dide the 1:9 complex with approximately 1000 mics on a tab and with tons of psych experience I was seeing tracers and shit that was not there&nbsp; off 1 hit. There is definitly something &quot;magical&quot; about the 25I even more so than what 25C can do, of course nothing like LSD but awesome in its own right. anyways, hope you have an awesome time man

				Smoking pot may help bring out visuals but I don&#039;t have any experience with that.<br /><br />If the 25i-NBOMe doesn&#039;t work well for you then you won&#039;t be the first.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be interested to hear later if you find 2C-B to be superior.

				Guess I&#039;m a little late for the tips. For next time, drammamine is really good for nausea (taken 1 hour before tripping). Preloading on chelated magnesium also helps for a smoother come-up. This goes for both the 2c-b and 25i. <br /><br />In any case, I hear pot goes well with the 25 series, just be careful as it will make you trip harder. <br /><br />

				I would have tried tested and proven physcadelics first like LSD before adventuring into the world of 25i-NBOME. having only eaten mushrrooms and lsd i cant coment in nbome but my friends highly recommend it. Getting a bit old for dabbling in hallucinegenics. I preger MDMA and would highly recommend the MORTAL KOMBATS. there dynamite and everyone knows THE CANDYSHOP got the best pilks on the road :) i recommend this vendor.

				25i nbome gave me some of the greatest visuals i have ever had at the 2mg range with low tolerance, shit was changing before my eyes and the colors were amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do suggest smoking weed on the comeup to help the nausea and i also suggest putting the blotter in your top lip and spitting your spit every once in a while.<br /><br />I will say that 25i nbome after a while when compared to real LSD just feels dirty 25i is a dirty chem not very clean imo<br /><br />2cB is a cool drug pop the 25 mg smoke a bowl 1 hour after and you will have a good night 2CB&nbsp; i would say is less of a body load then 25i but idk why i hate 25 i so much tripped on it probably 20 times

				If you can get some Xanax to go along with it get some. You can take it if you start to get very anxious or start &quot;freaking&quot; out and although it will dull the trip it&#039;ll be enjoyable rather than a mental roller coaster. I know a guy that does 25I a lot usually 2mg and he said that in combo with 2mg of Xanax it was the best trip he ever had. <br /><br />In my personal opinion benzo&#039;s mixed with psychedelics in the correct ratio can yield a more enjoyable experience than psychedelics alone especially for anxiety prone people. I had 10g of shrooms in combo with 4mg xanax and that was the funniest trip I&#039;ve ever had. No anxiety nothing except for the fact that I was laughing at everything uncontrollably :)<br />

				Smoking weed on anything is awesome for me. it always tends to enhance the experience ALOT, especially some legit Lucy. I even like smoking on molly, even though I&#039;ve had someone tell me it mellows out their roll ( I really think they were pussies or poor and didnt have a lot of molly), but maybe its cause I like to bomb like .3 at once for a really nice roll... I know I have done way too much e pillz and molly in my life lol

				haha talk about impressive drug combinations try mixing AMT, 5-Meo-MIPT, HBWR seeds, and then while peaking smoking a fat joint of 60x salvia. Amazingly I only threw up once and i didnt even care cause I was tripping so hard, but seriously this combination was one of the other &quot;craziest&quot; trips I&#039;ve ever had, the AMT is what blew the cap off the sewer so to speak. Oh yes but I did learn from this trip that I should only smoke salvia when tripping on other drugs because If I am just weed high or sober it wont really make me trip anymore, just makes me feel like im stuck in a styrofoam block lols.<br /><br />Oh yes and K is amazing with any psychadelic i could imagine, its just that awesome feelin shit with juuuuuuust the right amount of trippiness in it lol. I have now decided I really wanna blow a whole point of K with every psychadelic i can haha see the differences, make a line chart or some shit for the kiddies in D.A.R.E.

				25i will not make you groggy during or after comedown. I&#039;m normally very awake and have a hard time sleeping for a few hours after comedown. However, I normally feel kind of groggy during the come-up ... I never fall asleep but feel like I could. <br /><br />Yes, all nbomes are bitter ... getting powder and sniffing it would eliminate that. But if 25c made you uncomfortable, you probably wont like 25i as the body load is even more harsh. <br /><br />25b has a lighter body load than 25c or 25i IMO. The comeup can be a bit harsh since it&#039;s quicker but it&#039;s pretty smooth and euphoric afterward, similar to 2c-b but it really is a different beast. <br /><br />As for spiritual experiences, can&#039;t say I had any on an nbome: too artificial.

				Of course LSD has downsides. It&#039;s just been around for over 70 years and has been thoroughly tested to be relatively safe (assuming you do your research and acquaint yourself with the basic do&#039;s and dont&#039;s of lsd and take proper precautions). A research chemical is a research chemical because it has not been properly tested on humans. <br /><br />As for when you can take it again ... here is a tolerance chart (clearnet warning: http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/479297-The-Big-amp-Dandy-LSD-amp-Shroom-Tolerance-FAQ-and-Discussion-Thread). You can take it the next day if you&#039;re willing to double the dose you took before for the sake of tripping 2 days in a row. If you&#039;re asking when tolerance resets completely ... 14 days.

I&#039;ve heard it described before as a &quot;party LSD,&quot; which seems like a fairly decent way of describing it to others.<br /><br />Best of luck with future experimentation. Just be careful with this shit, as it&#039;s fairly easy to get into hot water with the 25s.

				when you take NBOMe on blotter if you hold it in your mouth and try and hold as much original spit in your mouth without swallowing or spitting for like 30 minutes you WILL trip hard as fuck I am sure, except for some of the people that arent really affected by phenethylamines. I&#039;ve seen a lot of kids just swallow all their spit and move the tab around in their mouth alot, probably swallowing a lot of the NBOMe and then saying they didnt really feel shit but a body high. I have done this too and there is a HUGE difference between holding and swishing all your spit for 30 minutes and swallowing it. I def think snorting is way to go with NBOMe&#039;s, but like the one guy said get some LSD if you want a truely immersive psychadelic experience. Most people I know get sold NBOMe as acid by sum dumbfuck, or get NBOMe because they cannot aquire LSD at the time lol

				I might be mistaken but i thought i read the analogue act not to long ago and remember seeing that even if something is an analogue you have to be consuming it or selling it for consumption to be prosecuted, simple solution, the &quot;Not For Human Consumption&quot; label, tada!

				I tend to have a few drinks...alcohol then drop a tab of 25i, few more drinks and a second tab an hour or two later, find the alcohol helps deal with the body load and once the second tab kinks in I&#039;m totally wasted. Then it&#039;s time to have some weed. definitely great for partying. Used to do a lot of 2CI, never measures doses so sometime took way too much and was f*cked, would come good later though....music was awesome however.

				I haven&#039;t tried 25i-NBOMe, but for a newbie in psychedelics I would go with psilocybe mushrooms. Mushrooms have a very spiritual dimension which I think is much more interesting than just visuals. Though visuals with mushrooms are beautiful. For mushrooms I would suggest taking them in a quiet environment (they are not a party club), or in nature. My preferred method of ingestion is to brew a tea, so that they are easier on your stomach. I would recommend around 2g for a newbie, but 3-5g for a stronger trip.<br /><br />2CB is interesting, but I found it lacking the spirituality of mushrooms. I particularly like LSD, but at high doses it can be quite overwhelming if you are not experienced with psychedelics.... and then there is DMT for the more advanced psychonaut...
