				I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; The Europeans have done a pretty good job of independently testing their vendors&#039; coke.&nbsp; It makes no sense to me that North America seems to have such lower quality.&nbsp; I wish we had someone doing testing over here.&nbsp;

				Levamisole is a nasty cut, and is 90% of the reason I don&#039;t really do coke anymore.<br /><br />It&#039;s gotten ridiculous.

				Everything I&#039;ve read indicates that the Levamisol cut is being added way up the distribution chain, which is why it&#039;s turning up just about everywhere, including the product sold in Colombia, as that article makes clear.&nbsp; At some point, the scum who decided that adding this stuff was a good idea will realize its ultimately bad for business.

				There are two good UK coke suppliers that I know of ATM:<br />1) Amethyst - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/5558132d80<br />2) Budwork UK - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/bd9b2bd948<br /><br />Unfortunately, neither have coke listings up ATM :( :( :(<br />Although I messaged Amethyst earlier today and he/she said they would have listings up later this week.<br />&nbsp;Budwork UK has no Levamisol in it at last analysis.<br />Had some of Amethyst&#039;s coke yesterday and I thought it was excellent, not &quot;edgy&quot; so no speed cut, dissolved easily in water at room temp and slept easily that night with help of a valium.<br />&nbsp;Will buy again, but need to find an easy way to detect presence of Levamisol !

				Ok guys first thanks for feedback advices and all.<br />About levamisole a lots of small producers of coca know the trick these days and add it to there batches,<br />i don&#039;t say all of them and talk only about small ones who have learned to transform coca leaves to (HCL? I don&#039;t know if its the proper term) lets say to cocaine how we know it.<br /><br />I have read the FrankMatthews&#039;s review already and there is not so much about C, just people talking about H n4 or n3 which apparently is amazing but this is not my thing at all.<br />About the &quot;independent&quot; lab test result thread FM&#039;s result are from 08/02/13, i guess he got a few batches since and even him stated this somewhere in the forums, actually he got a new one the 25/06/13, my order was ship the 26/06/13 so i don&#039;t know if its the new one or the one before that which is anyways not the same as early february.<br /><br />For this lab test result thread i have put independent between &quot; &quot; (don&#039;t remember the name of this sign) because how a member named &quot;undercover_agent&quot; stated and again with all the respect due to PineappleLove which i thanks again for his work because it is still a good source of information i think,<br />too much buzz about it, not so anonym and no &quot;officials&quot; documents attached or links to it or whatever just number posted on a thread and a link to a &quot;homemade&quot; onion&#039;s site. (even if for the last statement i personally trust him i mean i don&#039;t think he just put invented numbers).<br />So someone a bit too much paranoid could imagine anything and we all know drugs help to be.<br />And again i still love the initiative so thanks for that PineappleLove!<br /><br />After that i have see there is some sellers in europe who looks like to have superior product than FM but there price is so high!<br />I really hope its fucking good product with no cuts at all...(looks quite difficult these days)<br /><br />Finally thanks again to all of you guys (and girls?) for communicating, links to threads and seller etc...<br />I feel its a great community on here!
