				I was thinking of ordering from him as well. After looking at his reviews it looks like it takes about 10-12 days to get the product. The packaging looks to be sometimes hit or miss at times. Overall it seems that he has positive reviews and his prices are just kinda too good to pass up. I&#039;d prolly suggest to make a small order first so you can get a better feel on the vendor. That&#039;s what I usually do with vendors I&#039;ve never dealt with :)

				I am waiting on an order that apparently was never shipped out, now I cant get a straight answer on what is actually happening.&nbsp; I got two messages today one said &quot;waiting to hear&quot;&nbsp; HEAR WHAT?? and since it is close to auto financing time I asked of rrefund if it hadn&#039;t been shipped now they say it shipped.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went with them also after reading thru the feedback I am hoping this is legit.&nbsp; I got ripped off the beginning of this month for $300 from someone selling fake pills from CHINA.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not a newbie and have never gotten stung before on SR till May....so now I am anxious.&nbsp; I can say one thing good they communicate immediately.&nbsp; So my fingers are crossed

				I have tried the following<br /><br />Modafinil/ Modivigil( generic indian form)<br /><br />Very good/Legit stuff<br /><br />Clomazepam (onapil-2 ) Generic indian brand<br /><br />Crap, effects felt sometimes ... very hit and miss. I paid Top dollar for Rooche brand and he sent me this shit. i paid 60 bucks and he sent me a rpduct that cost roughly 2-5 aus dollars<br /><br />Valium - (Alprazolam/tranax 1 )<br /><br />Tablet breaks before it even gets pushed out of sealed package.&nbsp; Diud not feel effects<br /><br />Lorazepam (Generic was atipam)<br /><br />Not worth it. <br /><br />Valium 10mg ( zepdose)<br /><br />were ok... <br /><br /><br />But customer service was the most fucked thing . He said he would offer samples, i made 6 purchases recieved none.<br />He mislead me with the clomazepam then said he would reship a diff brand but he just sent th same thing!<br />I asked for my 10 free valium (cause i ordered 30) and i didnt recieve 3 times off him and still havnt got<br />I then left him a bad review and he said he would post about me online<br /><br />heres a little sample of our convo<br /><br /><br />ME<br /><br />&nbsp;Hey mate just recieved your package but you said you would send me &quot;rooche&quot; brand clomazepam as thats what i paid for last time and u said ok ill send you a different brand again? Also didnt get my bonus ten diazepa again? Is there anyway u could actually ship me a different brand preferably rooche cause this is all my buyers want and i cant do shite with these crypta brand ones bar ibin them , or give them away? Also you said you would esn a sample of lyrica and baclofen and i got neither? any chance u could do a resend of those before i finalise? otherwise im not going to be able to leave a very good review at all and i dont wanna bring ur rating down! Ive lleft u killa reviews in te past and am gonna have to change them if there is no resolution here...<br /><br />On the plus side the modafinil came through fine but yea issues were to summarise<br />( i ordered rooche brand , as you listed paid the extra for the what u claim is the legit brand from france but got some cytpa and u said u would reship a new brand as these i cannot sell! and not what i paid for)<br /><br />(also didnt recive sample)<br /><br />and didnt recieve my bonus 10 diazepam from the past 2 orders?<br /><br />So could u reship or do you want me to just leave wht i think is a fair review? if we resolve this of course ill give u 5/5 and finalise release money from escrow... just feel let down cause u said you would take down a note so you didnt forget again ! :(<br /><br />GOT MILK- I dont stock roche rivotril anymore, we dont have anymore its abnend in Africa now.<br /><br />all I have is what I sent you from India<br /><br />ME - LEFT HIM BAD REVIEW EXPLAINING THAT I DIDNT RECIEVE WHAT I PAID FOR (COMPLETELY DIFF BRAND , NO FREE SAMPLES, NO PLUS 10 FREEBIES AFTER 3 DIFF TRANSACTIONS. iVE MADE 7 ALL UP AND HE KEPT SAYING HE WOULD FIX THIS UP AND I KEPT HAVING FAITH SO AT THIS STAGE I LEFT A 2/5<br />i THEN RECIEVED THIS MESSAGE<br /><br />GOTMILK- hey mate, saw your review going to leave one about you in vendor forum.<br /><br />you want to disprect me after I sent you free reships and was super nice to you. You are a pun and will end up getting balcklisted soon enough.<br /><br />Good luck will popperz there shits junk, bye<br /><br />ME- This could all be resolved and ill change my coment if you answer each of these questions 1 by 1? then ill happily change it to a 5 star and fix up the feedback?<br /><br />If i even see my name pop up in the forums ill simply post this whole message thread and let the people decide who is in the wrong?<br /><br />Have you ever heard of reddit/silkroad<br />blue light and drugs 4 u? im moderators in each mate so dont start spreading nasty rumours,.. cause i will turn your name to mud mate.<br /><br />So simply appolagise answer my questions and we will sort something out and i will change my review.<br /><br />Think before you type this time KK? what would u have given a vendour out of 5 who did the follloowing^^?? REALLY? honestly would u give me 5 star if i treated u like that ? dont think so mate<br /><br />u were my fav vendouir and u really let me dowyour not thinking strightmate . u sent me<br />1) a product not listed in the description<br />2) the reship was the SAME PRODUCT?<br />3) NO SAMPLES AS ADVERTISED<br />4) NO FREE 10 VALIUM as advertised<br />5) and then i try and resolve it over what? 5 transactions with you and each time u reply with some message as simple as ok when i type you about a 100 word message??<br /><br />so really who is in the wrong here me or you? before you start saying nastey things about me put yourself in my FUCKING SHOES as a buyer whos invbested 100$ of my money in your product to get some of the slopiest service in the world? check my account mate i got 1 refund and ive spent over 3K<br /><br />This could all be resolved and ill change my coment if you answer each of these questions 1 by 1? then ill happily change it to a 5 star and fix up the feedback?<br /><br />GOTMILK<br />-Bor you area good cleitn stop stepping on my balls.<br /><br />1) a product not listed in the description - rivotril is sold out we sent you twice generic rivotril yet you still bitch at me<br />2) the reship was the SAME PRODUCT? - YES - see above<br />3) NO SAMPLES AS ADVERTISED - We dont normally do samples from India unless you ask specifically. from africa no problem because it takes many weeks to arrive we try to compinsate plus shipping is like $5 usd I pay $30 usd per EMS for controlled meds.<br />4) NO FREE 10 VALIUM as advertised - se above<br />5) and then i try and resolve it over what? 5 transactions with you and each time u reply with some message as simple as ok when i type you about a 100 word message?? - we have 100 emaisl a day and other vnetures, we will hire better customer service reps in future. <br /><br />ME- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-you advertised Genuine rooche brand tablets and sent me junk (FALSE ADVERTISING)<br /><br />-u then resent me junk after saying i would send a different BRAND ( LIE RESENT SAME BRAND)<br /><br />-have u read your home page? it says 10 FREE VALIUM and no where on your page does it say that it cant be sent because i have to get it from africa? ( LIE , MISLEADING , FALSE ADVERTISING)<br /><br />i asked u three times FOR SAMPLES ( CHECK OUR PAST MESSAGES)and you said sure your a great customer or :ok &quot; everytime???<br />(MISLEADING , LIES, FALSE VENDOUR PAGE)<br /><br />AND LASTLY COPY AND PASTE SOMETHING YOU HAVE TRIED AND RESOLVED FROM OUR CONVOS??can you please copy and paste anything you have tried to resolve?<br /><br />im still waiting on an apolagay too and ive changed your feedback to 4 but its gonna change if i dont get 1.<br />And ur gonna put my name on the forums for what? not giving samples when promised , false advertsing ( i have screen brand sot of rooche brand) I paid $59.95 for fuking k pins that i thought that were gonna be legit that i bought from bali on holiday last ear for about 3 aussie dollars ??? and then you resent them after saying diff brand.,..... arrrrrr<br /><br />What can we resolve out of this?<br /><br />GOTMILK- I guess I am sorry I am a lying cocksucker.<br /><br />Good day<br /><br />this is just a snippit of our convos. alll i wanted was what i ordered and he failed near 7 times,,,, so anoying. plus i always send my messages 3 times casuse he never replies.<br /><br /><br />also packaging always makes it through customs... god knows how its sooooo sloppy&nbsp; but i guess thats 1 plus side. But yea id only order modaf, but gonna get that from a diff indian vendour cause this bloke is off his lemon spread<br /><br /><br /><br />
