				I am going to purchase bitcoins through bitistant because I need to pay cash for them. So after I go and pay for them through CVS or walmart, it says they will be sent to my tormail, how would I get the coins out to be able to spend them on the SR website.<br />I know this may sound really stupid but I am just learning how to do all of this, any insight on this would be great.

				I&#039;ve never used bitinstants btc to email service so I&#039;m not sure what kind of email your going to get, but I imagine the email will tell you what to do next.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always used the btc to btc address option and have them sent to my wallet.&nbsp; Never had any problems.&nbsp;

				There are many different types of wallets, online, offline, hybrids, I would read up on the SR Wiki, good information there.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If just google bitcoin wallet or what is a bitcoin wallet you will find what you need.&nbsp; Just take some time and do some research, i know it is alot to take in but just take it slow and eventually it will all click.<br /><br />

				here is an relatively easy guide to get you set up...you seem somewhat familiar with the process but here it goes: if you go to blockchain.info/wallet you can create your own wallet. Once you create your own wallet you will see on the right side of the screen easy deposit and then follow the directions. You already seem familiar with moneygram (the service used to transfer cash to bitcoins). once you fill out the zipzap form you will get an email and pdf file either print that or write down relevant numbers and take that to cvs/walmart/where ever and once you pay itll transfer directly to your wallet. From there you just go to sr account, click on account, make deposit and itll give you an address (long string of numbers). Go back to your wallet and choose option send money type in your address as seen on your SR account and in an hour or so itll show up. I did my first deposit yesterday make sure you only transfer a small amount first to make sure it shows up. Change your pin and passphrase to avoid phishing and scammers (unless you want to risk losing all your money). hope this helps! Good luck!

				Kudos to the nice guide but half of the process to using the road is being able to use it without someone laying it all out for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you can&#039;t use SR by googling for information or reading through forums and you have to post to get someone to give you a short simple answer then maybe SR isn&#039;t for you<br /><br />If you don&#039;t figure out the initial processes of getting BTC and using SR on your own then you&#039;ll lack the experience and understanding necessary to avoid&nbsp; mistakes when using SR, mistakes which could potentially put us all at risk.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to say the forum isn&#039;t a wonderful place for advice or to help get, or get you started but you want to do this research yourself because it wont be last time you&#039;ll need to make use of reading or searching the forums.

				Personally i had it sent to an mtgox account, bought the coins, sent them to my bitcoin wallet then to the sr. the easyiest way to get a wallet is to install and run the default bitcoin client and make a new address to recieve coins at and give that address to bitinstant or whoever is sending you btc

				Thanks everyone for the help! I knew what I had to do just didn&#039;t know what was the best way. I also did alot of research but it is alot different when you can get an answer from someone who already uses SR.

				By not teaching people you put more people at risk. If you think that giving someone the least amount of info guiding them to look up the info actually teaches them anything your wrong. The people that have made it this far know how to look things up and follow directions. If they are asking it is because they are too lazy to look it up. Or, they have looked it up and misunderstood what they were reading.<br /><br />By doing this, it leaves them open to dip shits that give wrong info, whether it be on purpose or because they don&#039;t know, which allows them to fuck up and possibly fuck up others. So, why not give them the info to begin with?&nbsp; Being SELF RIGHTEOUS with knowledge does nothing for us on the ROAD.

				I agree with Southpaw...people that have made it as far as to look at the forum and be apart of this wonderful website and are willing to ask question deserve a good response. As I have learned from the small amount of time I have been here is that this website and the amount of users Tor has the stronger we are (strength in numbers). If your seriously saying Fuck those that ask simple question then fuck off! I think someone who has registered to the forum shows some sort of effort in trying to understand this website. Just because you might find it easy to do everything doesn&#039;t mean everyone else finds it easy. Jesus ignorant people its a free market and everyone deserves a chance to use this wonderful resource!

				I didn&#039;t use the BTC to email option when I used BitInstant.&nbsp; I used the BTC to Wallet/BTC address option(don&#039;t remember what it was called).&nbsp; But Im sure if you use the email option it will send you BTC address or code to be able to access your wallet.&nbsp; As one of the other posts read, there really are a lot of options out there.&nbsp; Get yourself a &quot;Few&quot; wallets @ Blockchain.info.&nbsp; The easiest way I&#039;ve found of doing this.&nbsp; I just started about a week and a half ago myself.&nbsp; It really is a pain in the ass with all the channels you have to jump through, but - if you want high quality drugs, this is the way to do it.&nbsp; Send me a message if I can be of anymore help.

				ALSO - the way I learned before I ever signed up for anything - if these forums are too confusing - Definitely check out the BitCoin videos they have on YouTube and Vimeo.&nbsp; They will explain ALOT and have excellent pictorials - Good Luck!
