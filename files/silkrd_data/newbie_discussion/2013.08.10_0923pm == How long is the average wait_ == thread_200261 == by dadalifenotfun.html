				I ordered domestically and it was shipped last week, how long is an expected wait for a US package?&nbsp; Do they deliver mail on saturdays? I&#039;m waiting on my package for an event and the vendor said to expect it by Thursday 8/8.&nbsp; Thank you.

				Seems like a longer-than-usual wait. I live in a US location where mail has longer shipping times than most and it comes faster than what you&#039;re reporting. Also, USPS works on Saturdays. Best of luck. Might want to message the vendor and be like, &quot;WTF maan.&quot;

				Depends on how far apart you live from the vendor. I can only speak for Canada, but packages coming across the country here can often take over a week in transit.

				I would definitely contact the vendor and ask if he is able to track the package.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming it was marked in transit sometime ago? If it hasn&#039;t, you should probably cancel for a refund.

				I just messaged the vendor.&nbsp; The package was marked in transit 8 days ago...&nbsp; This vendor has (100) and many reviews, most of the reviews talk about how quick the delivery is.&nbsp; I am hoping this is not a selective scamming attempt.&nbsp; The BTC are currently in escrow so hopefully if things go bad SR will give me a refund.&nbsp; I am extremely anxious to be honest, this wait eats you alive everyday that passes.&nbsp; Fingers are crossed.&nbsp; Has anyone else received a package this late?&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t want to name who this vendor is but he/she is currently on vacation so I&#039;m not sure if I will get a response :\ <br /><br />This is a domestic order,(I&#039;m assuming) it is being shipped from east coast to west coast.&nbsp; I will give the vendor till Monday before cancelling the order.&nbsp; How do I cancel? Sorry I am very new.&nbsp; Your replies are much appreciated, Have a great day everyone!

				Well, once it&#039;s marked in transit, you&#039;re unable to cancel the order.<br /><br />You&#039;ll have to select the &quot;resolve&quot; option on the orders screen. A refund amount will be decided either by the vendor (if you agree) or an SR admin will review the evidence and make a decision if you feel the refund amount is insufficient.<br /><br />There is a bit more info here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=The_ordering_process

				I guess you could just give him the benefit of the doubt and say he&#039;s backed up. If it&#039;s a west to east coast transaction, I can partially understand. Still shouldn&#039;t take that long. Maybe hes backed up with orders

				Just a few facts I recall from the postal service. Please note, as they have recently changed things up, my knowledge may be a bit dated. I am not a postal employee but have made friends with many. <br /><br />First class parcels can take up to 5 business days, Priority is 2-3 (on a rare occasion 4).<br /><br />The difference in transit time is processing priority at sorting facilities or airports. <br /><br />Express mail is awarded highest priority and always is sent directly to the destination sort facility. In layman&#039;s terms it&#039;s the first thing they load on the plane/truck and the first thing they sort when unloading. These packages are given first priority to keep with their next day guarantee. <br /><br />Non Flat-rate Priority is next. <br /><br />Followed by flat-rate Priority.<br /><br />Then First class letters then parcels. <br /><br />Parcel post is last. Usually put in wherever it can fit. <br /><br />There are space and tonnage procedures too but I don&#039;t know in detail what they are. Plane specific stuff that programs run through to ensure every last cubic inch and ounce of weight capacity is utilized.

				I believe the package was priority mail.&nbsp; Should I be worried about LE/CD? I am very anxious...

				If for some reason the tracking says the package is with the USPS and it hasn&#039;t moved or you haven&#039;t received it, than fuck it. Best to let the package go &amp; not get pinched. Instead, just take it up with the vendor
