				near impossible??? i&#039;m in the USA and just recieved two seperate orders of btc in two days.&nbsp; The first i did on localbitcoins.com i was able to buy BTC with mny credit card through paypal in a matter of minutes ( you can buy moneygram online with a debit card as well and use that to buy btc if no one is offering paypal) BTC is still very easy to get.&nbsp; in fact easier than it used to be.&nbsp; I used to have to drive around go to walmart so on and so forth now i never leave my chair.

				i have had no problem getting coins this week i have done 4 separate transactions and no issues whatever, i vary between localbitcoins, CampBx, and my trusted SR vendors...you should check out the avenues everyone has listed and see what is your best option and what fees you are willing to pay...if you decide to use SR for coins its risky but there are some good vendors if you dont want to use localbitcoins or CampBx....i recommend BTCking and JumboMonkeyBiscuit when they are available i know there are other trusted vendors but i have had multiple transactions with those guys without a problem ever...sometimes vendors will offer a cash out option to customers especially loyal customers of theres where they can trade the USD to BTC for little to no fee at all cause you are saving the vendor money so he doesnt have to pay an exchange to change the funds, so if you have any vendors that you have good relationships with just PM them and see what they say, either way do the research and if you are looking on the road if something seems to good for coins and the vendor is new it probably is so watch out for scams otherwise you should have fun on here hopefully you get some coins soon

				campBX.&nbsp; And they take deposits from Dwolla still.&nbsp; If you&#039;re credit&#039;s good, coinbase for instant purchase.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had no problem buying coins.&nbsp; It&#039;s mining them that&#039;s become damn near impossible.
