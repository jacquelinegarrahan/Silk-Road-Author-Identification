				barcoding is very simple and can generate a lot of profit. Ill use legos as an example<br /><br />You right down the UPC number down for a the lego set that is 20 bucks. You put that number on a UPC generator print out the product. You place over the 120 buck UPC with the 20 UPC. When the Cashier rings up the the product&#039;s bar code it rings as 20 bucks. Than you resell. Its harder to prove with shoplifting and would be even harder to pin on you if you do it with a friend. What you do is have one guy go in place the codes and leave. Maybe buy a few things. The other guy than buys the tagged products.

				Just write down the numbers and CAREFULLY peel off that scratch off sticker so you dont scratch it and write those numbers down as well. I used to do it easy, ordered online to someone elses house and sold the shit on craigslist. Lots of people buy 100 dollar gift cards and such and do not use it for a while due to them being gifts, they are bought in advanced, just keep checking to see if it was activated and once it is shop.

				Hes saying go a place like CVS. Write down the credit card information required to make a purchase without making the gift card look like it has been tampered with. Leave the gift card in the shop. Wait for someone to buy the gift card. Than buy something with it than resell what was bought. The shipping to another address is a drop point. It is credit card fraud so you would need to take safety measures.

				Since I&#039;m asking id also contribute a little with going a little indepth with barcoding<br /><br />Things you will need<br />A brain<br />A computer <br />Printer<br />Ruler<br /><br /><br />First off. Id go to a store that is not a target store. This store is used for you to gather your information on the product.<br />A peace of cardboard that you can tuck between your fingers with measuring marks is recommended. This will make sure you cut your UPC in the right dimensions to cover the old ones. You only need the numbers off the UPC. the UPC generator will generate the UPC for you based off the numbers you enter. <br /><br />When targeting a product. <br />Keep this in mind some high end products at Walmart have two UPCs on them. One is the standard one that is apart of the box but the other is one created by the store. The store 1 is not pure white. It is yellow and white. This sticker contains the product name that gets rang up at the register. So the name on that sticker is what the cashier will see when it is rang up. <br />You want to keep products with the same brand. You don&#039;t want to put a legos UPC on a computer&#039;s UPC. The cashier would see that you are buying legos when you in fact have a full blow computer.<br /><br />UPC generators<br />http://www.barcoding.com/upc/<br />http://sourceforge.net/projects/zint/<br />Also google is a powerful source. They are not hidden just look around a little. Any upc on a box you can get generated yourself via software.<br /><br />Paper<br />You can get shipping labels from warlmart and print on them. <br /><br />Cashiers<br />Target younger cashiers. The older ones tend to take their job too far for being paid min wage. Just look around for a derp. Also keep in mind these people are fucking cashiers. They are derpy. Just find the derpiest one. I have seen people just fucking take paper and tape it onto spry paint cans and buy a 10 dollar can for .99<br /><br /><br /><br />Your look<br />Don&#039;t go dressed like some sorta punk. If you are over 18 I would recommend some decent clothes. This is all for you to get past the cashier and if they call you out on it so you can be better off saying I don&#039;t know.<br /><br /><br />Know your state laws. <br /><br />Keep in mind things you get via this method could be looked into. You should keep in mind stores hire private investigators to look into this because the police really don&#039;t give a fuck after you leave the store. These guys try to track you down. So avoid being seen on cam when placing the new barcodes. If the store does not have video proof of you putting the barcode on than police wont arrest you even if pulled into the back room since they don&#039;t have proof that you did it.<br /><br />Selling on cragslist and ebay can be risky depending on how long you wait, and many factors.<br /><br />

				So that&#039;s a no on severing your own body parts? I wasn&#039;t kidding, I&#039;ll pay more the more painful it is. I don&#039;t have enough to see you castrate yourself, so we&#039;re only talking fingers and toes. Maybe be a hand, if you&#039;re a slut.
