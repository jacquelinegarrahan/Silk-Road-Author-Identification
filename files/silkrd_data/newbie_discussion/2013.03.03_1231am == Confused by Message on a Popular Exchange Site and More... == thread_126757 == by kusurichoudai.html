				Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m *brand* new, and believe that I&#039;ve done most of the requisite reading / preparation, but there is, quite obviously a little bit of a learning curve...<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit confused about a few things - first:<br /><br />Upon visiting what seemed to be maybe the most popular BTC exchange site, (I haven&#039;t been around here long enough to know if it&#039;s considered good form to mention the name), while in the midst of making an account, I noticed this at the bottom of the page:<br /><br />&quot;* Please be advised that accessing your account via the Tor network and/or public proxies may result in a temporary suspension of your account, and having to submit AML documents. &quot;<br /><br />I was under the impression that usage of the Tor network (which I&#039;m already very familiar with) is required and indeed mandatory for just about any stage / facet of the whole SR experience. Just the act of getting BTC into an escrow account here, and making payments to vendors is going to require usage of the Tor network right? Maybe I&#039;m misunderstanding something.....<br /><br />Another question along the same lines - at what point does anonymity (meaning how I access the internet) need to start? I wouldn&#039;t think that using the Tor network would be necessary for starting an account with an exchange.<br /><br />And still *another* question....<br /><br />Is it considered good form or expected that we encrypt messages to vendors when we use the internal messaging system?<br /><br />At any rate, I&#039;m excited to be here to say the least, though I regret having to ask such basic questions and I&#039;m appreciative of any help.<br /><br />Thanks in Advance!

				Yes, you should be encrypting any kind of sensitive information that you send here - especially during the order process when you are providing your shipping address.<br /><br />TOR use is NOT necessary for starting an account with an exchange like Mt Gox or bitinstant ... in fact, several exchanges - just as you mentioned - have warnings about accessing your account through TOR.&nbsp; Just use the clearnet for your bitcoin exchange since buying bitcoins is 100% legal.

				Thank you scout for your prompt reply.<br /><br />RE: Setting up an account at Mt Gox *without* Tor - understood. Thanks.<br /><br />But what about the transaction of getting bitcoin into escrow here? I guess I won&#039;t be connecting directly to Mt Gox via Tor at that point&nbsp; - but the request will be coming from SR....and SR is using the Tor network so....you see where I&#039;m going with this?<br /><br />EDIT: I just found the FAQ ( I had read other material but not the FAQ specifically...will be devouring it.)

				Well, basically, use Mt Gox on clearnet - always - and use SR on TOR - always.&nbsp; When you need to send coins to SR, withdraw them from Mt Gox and for the bitcoin deposit address, use your SR deposit address (found on your account page over on SR itself).&nbsp; There is nothing about your SR wallet that identifies it as such -- so you don&#039;t need to worry about Mt Gox knowing that you&#039;re sending to SR, because it can&#039;t.&nbsp; And, once the coins hit your SR wallet, they are automatically mixed by SR&#039;s built-in coin tumbler.

				ah! (smacks forehead)<br /><br />I see - I can get the coin into SR without being connected to SR at all&nbsp; - I just give Mt Gox my wallet address and make the transfer *from* my Mt Gox account - got it.<br /><br />Thanks so much!<br />
