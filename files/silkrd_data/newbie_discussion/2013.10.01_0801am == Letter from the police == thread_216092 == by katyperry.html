				So someone I know got a letter from the police instead of his order. Is this common? What should he do?<br /><br />Make up some story (not really living at the adress, away a lot, noticed some damaged letters before but didn&#039;t think about it, so someone could have used it as a &quot;dropbox&quot;) or just say nothing at all? <br /><br />They invited him on short notice, but he saw the letter after the date already passed. The amount we&#039;re talking about isn&#039;t even worth prosecution in my opinion.

				no, say nothing. talking to the police will not help you, they are trying to build a case against you. they are not lookng to question you to find you innocent, they want to build that case. the only reason they question you is to gain evidence via confession to further their case. if they have enough evidence to charge you already then no matter what you say they will always assume you could be lying and charge you anyway. if they don&#039;t have enough to charge you then saying nothing can&#039;t possibly give them even more.<br /><br />you&#039;ll be surprised how you can fuck yourself in an interview by giving a false account. for one they will question you about every detail of your story and if you slip up about the smallest little detail they will then be able to show you to be a liar to the court which will be a nice little bonus for the prosecution when the trial starts.<br /><br />i know it sounds like the obvious no brainer to give a story and save yourself getting charged in the first place. but it can so easily backfire. plus if you talk now to the police then you have just given them your whole defense strategy months before you go to court. they now got a whole lotta time to work a way around it. that&#039;s why its even more important for innocent suspects to stick to no comment answers.<br /><br />do yourself a favor, keep your defense for when it really matters, in the court room.

				Those letters typically sound very official, as if you will get into trouble if you don&#039;t go. Like isallmememe said, they can use anything you say against you, so it&#039;s best not to say a word. I wouldn&#039;t respond to the letter (as I don&#039;t think there is a law requiring people to respond to them) and make them do some actual police work to get an arrest warrant rather than offer myself up so easily. In reality, they don&#039;t have much to go on and want an admission of guilt to wrap it up easily because otherwise it&#039;s a lot of work for what is considered ridiculous to convict on (depending on the substance). Even if I were arrested, I wouldn&#039;t say a single word; always let your lawyer do the talking.

				let elaborate some more. the reason most people who are actually innocent, get found guilty of crimes is because they took the obvious step. they explained to those &#039;nice police officers&#039; about what really happened so this mess can all be quickly cleared up and they can go home. the pigs then give that information over to the prosecutor. <br /><br />the thing a lot of people don&#039;t understand about the law is its not about what really happened. its about whether the prosecutor or the defender gives the best performance in court. its all about word play and asking the right questions at the right time, or not asking certain questions at all.<br /><br />a prosecutor that has a good idea what your story is going to be before the trial starts has time to figure out the best strategy and exactly what to say and not say to make you look guilty. the prosecutors whole job is to present the case for you being guilty. even if he 100% believes you are innocent anyway, he still has to try to show you as guilty, and he will.<br /><br />and that is the reason why smart people don&#039;t ever talk in a police interview. its not so much about not slipping up and giving them more info, although that is still a real danger. its about not giving your defense strategy away too early. and its the courts you need to convince, they are the ones that will put you in jail, not the cops.

				say nothing to the police, tell your story to the court. the court will look at your side with an open mind and if they see that you are giving a fair account then they will let you go free. the cops are only looking at how they can make a charge stick. they don&#039;t want to hear anything that doesn&#039;t favor their case. they will either ignore it, refuse to believe it or look for a way to prove otherwise.

				This bit of advice is from personal experience. If it ever goes far enough you find yourself in a courtroom, never never, never, accept a public defender unless you absolutely positively have no other choice. Do whatever you can to pay for an attorney. Mortgage your home, borrow money, hell even steal money. The state pays for your public defender so in essence the people who are prosecuting and trying to send you to prison is paying for your defense. Talk about a conflict of interest. Most often a public defender is a green behind the ear, just out of law school dweeb who has lunch with the prosecutor.<br /><br />So always pay for a lawyer. The ones you pay for will actually work for you the more money the better attorney it is the Ju$t us system (err I mean justice) If you have enough money you can probably get away with murder (remember OJ Simpson) but if you have no choice but to accept a public pretender then sorry to break the bad news but prepare to be convicted.

				Hmm... I do agree with the strategy of not talking to the cops, but it has worked for me before to pull the wool over their eyes. Whether they knew I was lying or not, I can&#039;t be sure, but I totally played the doe-eyes, sweet young thing card and I got away with what could have been a felony charge. Let me explain:<br /><br />Me and two of my male friends were busted by the jump out boys, they pulled us into a parking lot after leaving a house they bought weed at. (They had foolishly parked on the wrong side of the road AND sat outside for awhile to weigh it.. dumbasses.) It didn&#039;t help that three of us are/were dreadheads and at least one of them had been arrested for pot, etc. before. The cops knew him by name.<br /><br />Anyway, I had just bought a full bottle of Adderall off someone, label pulled off, the whole nine. Didn&#039;t even try to hide it, it was right there in plain view in my purse. So fuck the weed, they&#039;re more worried about that when they see it. (What&#039;s crazy too is I had an instinctive feeling before we went to get the weed that I wanted to drop that off at my house first).<br /><br />They take me to their secret HQ or whatever the fuck for questioning and I just keep to my story that I didn&#039;t know what the pills were, that a friend gave them to me because I wanted to lose weight. &quot;Well you know we could charge you with a felony for these, right? We know what they are, what they&#039;ll come back as at the lab.&quot; &quot;Are you serious? I had no idea!&quot; Commence freak out, &quot;But officer, I&#039;m in school, if I catch a drug charge, I&#039;ll lose my financial aid!&quot;, etc.<br /><br />They want names, they want me to flip on someone. I really had just moved to the area and didn&#039;t really know anyone other than maybe a pot dealer, so it wasn&#039;t much of a lie when I told them I didn&#039;t know anyone. They threatened me, said they&#039;d let me go but if I didn&#039;t call them within a week with a name they&#039;d charge me. I was paranoid but didn&#039;t call em or hear from them again.<br /><br />..... and this is one time where acting the role of the innocent bystander did work. If I had refused to talk without a lawyer I&#039;m sure they would have taken me to court and I&#039;d probably be a convicted felon right now/at least have a criminal record. I don&#039;t.

If it ever goes far enough you find yourself in a courtroom, never never, never, accept a public defender unless you absolutely positively have no other choice. Do whatever you can to pay for an attorney. Mortgage your home, borrow money, hell even steal money. The state pays for your public defender so in essence the people who are prosecuting and trying to send you to prison is paying for your defense. Talk about a conflict of interest. Most often a public defender is a green behind the ear, just out of law school dweeb who has lunch with the prosecutor.<br /><br />So always pay for a lawyer. The ones you pay for will actually work for you the more money the better attorney it is the Ju$t us system (err I mean justice) If you have enough money you can probably get away with murder (remember OJ Simpson) but if you have no choice but to accept a public pretender then sorry to break the bad news but prepare to be convicted.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I used to work as an attorney for the Massachusetts court of appeals and the briefs written by the public defender&#039;s office, called the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS), were some of the best; generally more thorough, accurate, and better argued than those of the best law firms in the state. <br /><br />In many states, the public defender&#039;s office is incredibly selective, especially with regards to the are or program the attorney is responsible for. Public defenders are usually incredibly passionate about what they do. There is no conflict of interest present; the state has a vested interest in protecting the constitutional rights of its citizens, and the attorneys are committed to serving the interests of their client. Judges are state employees, too. <br /><br />Here&#039;s my advice: immediately invoke your right to counsel and to silence. The police are allowed to continue questioning you if you remain silent, but they must terminate any interrogation the moment you invoke the right to counsel. You should say nothing with regards to the incident at all. Nothing. Just say that you are invoking your right to counsel because you need an advocate and a professional to explain better to you what&#039;s going on here.

Believe it!<br /><br />Cops will get mad and slam shit down on the table to intimidate you. Your only response should be &quot;I am invoking my constitutional right to remain silent&quot; then only speak with your lawyer.<br /><br />Will you go to jail? Most likely yes right then and there but most people are typically released soon. They can keep you incarcerated for up to 72 hours before charging you (I think) Keeping quiet and doing a few days in jail is better than talking yourself into years in prison.<br /><br />The prison industry is big business so<br /><br />DO NOT TALK TOO THE POLICE!

				over here they will often try and tel you in an interview that if you tell them what they want to know then they will talk to the judge and get him to go easy on you. they often say this if they want you to grass somebody up, like a dealer. no surprise many people do actually fall for this shit. the fact is tho that if the police had that kind of influence on a judge then they would also have the influence to go the other way and get a judge to go harder than that on you. for one no judge would accept being told whether to go hard or easy on anybody, they have much too bigger ego&#039;s for that. but secondly that would in no way constitute a fair justice system. it does not and could not ever happen in a western country. it would take somebody way higher up a ladder than a cop to have influence like that.<br /><br />now that we have dvd recordings in police interviews here, and we are entitled by law to have a copy. if i ever find myself in an interview i seriously hope to god they try that shit on me now. i will let him say enough to incriminate himself, then tell him that i will be requiring a copy of the recording as is my right, and that he can expect to see himself on yt tonight telling the whole world what a corrupt legal system we have.<br /><br />i reckon that should shut him the fuck up.

				I agree with everything in this thread! Silence is golden. <br /><br />Also, if it&#039;s a trivial amount then not responding at all will certainly lose their interest.

				The problem is that there were 2 orders. I don&#039;t know how the mail system works. Maybe they search all the mail now my friend gets. It&#039;s still a very low amount of &quot;hard&quot; drugs sample size and some pain medicine. <br /><br />Also it&#039;s non-us justice system. It works a little bit different. I think they either don&#039;t prosecute because first time offender and low amount or they can also sentence a fine without trial. If you want to fight the fine you can have a trial, but it can make the judge/public prosecutor a bit angry if they think you abuse the option and then they raise the fine.<br /><br />But the justice system is a joke anyway. They steal from you and punish you for it.&nbsp; ::) ::) ::) ::) ::)<br />

				Does anyone know of any precedents set for prosecuting SR users?<br />I (aussie) heard of someone arrested, through the vine (in Perth, I think), who was dealing drugs he had purchased through the silkroad, from his home. A visitor was searched as he left the premises, after which it was raided.<br />I don&#039;t know the details of the charges he faced, nor whether he has consequently been convicted. That is the only case I have heard of where someone has been prosecuted(?) directly for buying or selling drugs through SR.<br />Who knows of some legal precedents in the area/ever?<br />Perhaps that would give OP some reference.

				usually the police wants the vendors and don&#039;t care too much about the little fish. <br /><br />I think usually you just don&#039;t get your order and that&#039;s it if we are not talking about large amounts. But there was a bust in july in germany linked to silkroad (they were selling the drug named in the letter and my buddy might have bought some of it). The vendor might have saved a database with his customers and this may have caused the letter, because the wrong drug is named in the criminal charge and the time is set before the recent order. <br /><br />Getting letters with drugs might be a different story than finding your name and adress at a raid. Either they saved it because they were stupid or the cops searched the printer memory? <br /><br />edit: The outcome as it is right now might be a fine ranging from $500 to 1k.

				If you got a letter from the police then you can assume they think they know where you live. If they had anything serious on you they would come and get you. They would at least come and knock on your door. <br />Sending you a letter asking you to hand your self in is a last resort attempt by some copper to get a result without putting in the work because they know that it&#039;s not worth chasing. They have better things to do with better chances of conviction.<br />Ignore it.<br />If you were daft enough to take them up on their kind offer then you are probably in some sort of panic, acting without thinking and very likely to drop yourself in it and do all their hard work for them. Turning a no hoper of a case into a sure thing.<br />Believe me they are just chancing it.<br />do not use the address for any more drops and remember if you do hand your self in they will arrest you and read you your right&#039;s which go something like this:<br />&quot;You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned anything you later rely on in court.&#039;&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

Searching the printer memory seems to be possible although I never heard of one case they really did this.<br /><br />You will only find out what they are knowing with a lawyer, they won&#039;t tell you the truth as they try to trick you into a confession. So remaining silent is still the best advice. No drug related criminal record will help a lot to keep the fine low or even to not prosecute.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m confused - did this happen in the US? If so, your friend has no obligation to go anywhere, do anything, or say anything. He should not respond to that letter. He shouldn&#039;t talk to the police and he shouldn&#039;t lie to the police. If confronted, he say (pleasantly), &quot;I grew up around lawyers. I would feel more comfortable having a professional advocate to explain the situation to me. I cannot speak to you without an attorney present.&quot; Done. Police have to stop questioning at that point. <br /><br />Miranda warnings are something the Supreme Court requires police officers to give for our benefit. It&#039;s not to scare us; it&#039;s to remind us of our constitutional rights. Refusing to speak and requesting counsel cannot be referenced at any hearing or trial and is cannot be considered an indication of guilt. <br /><br />Your friend isn&#039;t under arrest at this point, and the police can&#039;t detain him without a warrant outside of a Terry stop (which isn&#039;t an issue here). Since he&#039;s being pursued as a suspect, he&#039;s under no obligation to speak with or cooperate with the police beyond giving his name and submitting peacefully to detention.

				Never talk to the police, period. Unless you&#039;re uber confident and have a ton of experience in dealing with them. Even then.. its NOT advisable to speak with<br />police. They&#039;re just there to pump info out of you, if no one told on themselves or others..(not speaking). It would virtually destroy 85%+ of all cases!!<br /><br />Besides, if they knew all the details why the hell would they be asking? They just want info they don&#039;t have or a confession to hand over to a prosecutor!

				agreed NEVER talk to the police. you will very likely severely affect your chances of a lawyer getting you out of it. but isall-as a cops daughter, i can tell you that saying it may go easier on you if you cooperate, is very&nbsp; much standard operating procedure. when i was arrested they pulled that crap on me too.
