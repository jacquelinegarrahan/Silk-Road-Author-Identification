				I think its borderline derogatory. depending on the context its used it. eg &quot;you fucking cracker&quot; but then even when refering to someone in conversation it sounds a bit off. At least thats what I noticed in the south

				Angel Food Cake was invented by those master bakers, the Pennsylvania Duch, who named it so because it was light, airy, white... sorta divine. Devil&#039;s food cake was so named because it is the polar opposite of Angel&#039;s Food. Dark, rich, dense... sorta decadent. Any racism only comes from those that may ascribe alterior meanings to them.<br /><br />Is the term &quot;Cracker&quot; racist? Well, would you only call someone a &quot;Cracker&quot; if they were of a specific race (i.e. white)? If so, then yes. That&#039;s the practical definition of a racist term.

				Lorimer....great joke, great response to the &quot;cracker/racist&quot; issue....+1<br /><br />Sam....That&#039;s an interesting question!!&nbsp; If the guy feels the need to look over his shoulder before telling a racist joke it tells me more about his insecurities and would probably alert me to the fact that he&#039;s a &quot;closet racist.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; The very fact that he needed to look around first tells me he doesn&#039;t want otherwise &quot;regular&quot; people to know he enjoys telling off color, racist jokes in his spare time.&nbsp; He may also be checking if any folks who are the butt of his jokes were lingering around to overhear him and possibly wanting to beat his ass over it.&nbsp; This furtive look over the shoulder tells me the guy is an insecure, hypocritical racist coward.<br /><br />Let&#039;s take race out of the &quot;cracker&quot; issue and just consider it in context of white people calling other white people &quot;cracker.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; I guess this can be seen as the equivalent of a white person calling another white person &quot;white trash.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; I know some white people who think &quot;white trash&quot; is a horrible thing to say.&nbsp; I know others who take the label &quot;white trash&quot; and own it...even proud of the fact they are &quot;white trash.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; I see both &quot;cracker&quot; and &quot;white trash&quot; as mainly derogatory terms used by middle to upper-class whites to snobbishly dismiss whites of a lower social status or whites with little education who are uncouth in appearance and manners.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suppose some &quot;white trash&quot; earn that title, because there&#039;s a certain amount of them who know better but choose to live like that out of laziness or indifference.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Someone saying that there is no racism towards whites in North America is a bit biased in my opinion. Come to Houston and tell me everybody don&#039;t hate everybody. There is such a thing as &quot;white privilege&quot; but there&#039;s also the tipping point where the &quot;minorities&quot; become the majority, there are also federal, state, and private institutions dedicated to funding solely the African American or otherwise Hispanic (non-white) population. It&#039;s a double standard and it is racist to exclude an otherwise eligible candidate from obtaining something offered based on their skin color or ethnicity. <br /><br />Personally, coming from the South of the US, &quot;cracker&quot; isn&#039;t really a term I hear often.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s more of an old school stereotype. But you got to say it like &quot;cracka&quot; because if you say it with the &quot;-er&quot; it becomes offensive. But nah, in my experience, it&#039;s more &quot;white boy&quot; that is thrown around and often meant to be derogatory. <br /><br />And I&#039;m not racist I enjoy Angel food Cake and Devil food cake both equally.

				In Florida, the term &quot;cracker&quot; didnt used to be derogatory.&nbsp; Florida used to be cattle country, and when the trains went through, the cowboys would ride alongside the train cracking their bullwhips, hence the name.&nbsp; <br /><br />These days, when a black person calls me a &quot;cracker&quot; I understand they are trying to insult me, but I put it on the same level as when they call me &quot;boss.&quot;&nbsp; (Could I have a beer?&nbsp; Sure boss.&nbsp; Yeah, fuck you too, just bring me the beer.)<br /><br />It is said that white people have never been oppressed and so they shouldn&#039;t take offense.&nbsp; I&#039;m white, and my ancestors were sold into slavery in the Caribbean, and were visciously discriminated against in the US, but that&#039;s OK.&nbsp; The real reason white people don&#039;t take offense is because, contrary to what some people think, the vast majority of white people aren&#039;t racist, and are so guileless if not clueless they don&#039;t fully appreciate the venom that goes with that moniker.&nbsp; Sorry!

				Well Henry...This rube from Washington State has been taught a lesson.&nbsp; &nbsp;This entry from Wikipedia pretty much clears everything up about where &quot;cracker&quot; originated: <br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_cracker<br /><br />Very interesting....I had no idea Florida once had cowboys, but I suppose it makes sense.&nbsp; Florida was Ground Zero for a lot of what happened to the rest of America....and then the rest of America started moving back to Florida.&nbsp; &nbsp;So native Floridians take pride in the name &quot;Florida Cracker&quot; because it means they are descended from some of the original Floridians cow hustlers...or crackers.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Wikipedia entry for how the meaning of cracker changed over time.<br /><br />When I was dumbfounded in my previous post about cows/cowboys in Florida, I had the stereotypical picture of modern day Florida wedged in my mind:&nbsp; Sun, beaches, Disney World, spring training, voting irregularities (heh), the Everglades, the Keys, funky water table, and the all the retirees.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cows and Cowboys were the farthest thing from my mind.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is definitely a state I want to visit, along with the rest of the south.&nbsp; (Even though for some reason Florida doesn&#039;t seem part of the &quot;The South&quot; to me.)&nbsp; &nbsp; But enough with stereotypes........thanks Henry for the enlightenment...... :D<br /><br />

				Racists of any color are really just sheltered people who have not had the chance to spend any significant time with the race/people they hate and/or they have been stuck in the same neighborhood/area their whole lives. Sad really when you think about it, since they will never be able to see the world as it really is.

				Never underestimate Florida&#039;s capacity to astonish one with its weirdness....<br /><br />Getting back to the original post, there&#039;s a paradox here.&nbsp; Which is that black empowerment in the US has, all along, been dependent on cooperation from white people.&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is&nbsp; the degree of sanctimoniousness that goes along with getting involved in a big moral issue, and I think if people were less that way, and more humble, it would engender less resentment.&nbsp; This is not of course unique to our African-American brothers and sisters; I have Native American friends who say that &quot;Indian lovers&quot; drive them crazy.<br /><br />Always, always the government is the &quot;great white father.&quot;&nbsp; And that&#039;s another paradox; African-Americans politically favor a strong central government, because that&#039;s been the agent of black empowerment so far.&nbsp; I submit that the civil rights leaders have made a deal with the devil, and that the predominate problems faced by the African American community today stem in part from that bargain.&nbsp; <br /><br />So anyhow, people can call me a cracker if they want; I&#039;m not the one who profits from keeping black people down, I don&#039;t have any skin in that game, and that&#039;s why it&#039;s hard for me to get pissed off or offended.&nbsp; To be sure, though, any more the term &quot;cracker&quot; is explicitly racist

It&#039;s a sort of a white on white bias that has persisted in this country since the Civil War days.&nbsp; &nbsp;The large Baptist congregations and intolerant, superstitious religious sects that are so prevalent in the South kind of add fuel to the fire, from the Northern White perspective.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, I&#039;m not condoning any of this, but I do agree these sorts of ideas are held either consciously or unconsciously by many Northern Whites.&nbsp;

				Naggers! Good one...&nbsp; Lots of people in the south live in what are called &quot;cracker houses,&quot; this referring to the architecture, not the people who live in them. But someone suggested to me that it was a racist term, sort of like saying something is n***er-rigged or calling a boom box a ghetto blaster (not that anyone still carries around boom boxes- in fact anyone under the age of twenty might not even know what the term means). So what&#039;s the more PC term for a cracker house, I wonder?

				There are certain things one person can say that might be appropriate, when another person says it isn&#039;t appropriate at all.<br /><br />If a girl goes to a tittie bar and says, &quot;I think I&#039;ll get up there and dance with you,&quot; that seems perfectly appropriate.&nbsp; Great idea, in fact!&nbsp; When a guy says it, not so much.<br /><br />If a white person refers to a cracker house, he implies a certain rustic charm.&nbsp; If a black person says it, he implies a certain trailer-park-trash ambience.<br /><br />Chapelle has been saying nothing less for years now.&nbsp;
