				OK, so I came here looking for BTH and found the BOMB (if you&#039;re looking, look to FastForward and look no further), but he doesn&#039;t offer MDMA (Molly) and I want that bitch!&nbsp; So, I have a few questions:<br /><br />1) I haven&#039;t done any MDMA in a while (5+ years) but when I did, I had a high tolerance due to heavy usage (5+ pills, depending on quality).&nbsp; The last time I got a pill (not sure of purity, etc..) I felt great for about a half hour to an hour but that was it.&nbsp; So, I&#039;m looking for opinions on the amount you think I would need.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big dude (300+ lbs) looking for a good high for at least 3-4 hours.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried Molly (pure) and I intend to snort it - I think.<br /><br />2) Vendors???&nbsp; Looking for domestic for different reasons - I was thinking about trying to domestic redistribution of Lucky Luciano&#039;s that I saw on one of these forums, but it came in grams only and I don&#039;t know if I need that much.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather pay more for purity/quality but I don&#039;t think I need a lot. <br /><br />3) Combining MDMA w/ BTH - I know I used to get pills that were pressed with H back in the day (or at least that&#039;s what I was told), does anyone recommend this/not recommmend this??&nbsp; Any combo deals out there??<br /><br />Thanks in advance - on my way to 50!!!

				Not really the response I was soliciting...&nbsp; I&#039;m not a fan of promising a positive review in exchange for free stuff... I mean, if its good, sure, I&#039;ll hook it up to the fullest (which I&#039;m trying to do for my first transaction with FastForward), but if it sucks, I&#039;d feel whorish posting anything other than the truth.. In most cases, I&#039;d stick to what mama told me, &quot;If you don&#039;t got nothin nice to say, don&#039;t say nothin at all...&quot;<br /><br />Anyone else??

				I appreciate the offer and wish you luck in your venture!&nbsp; In the mean time, if you&#039;re such a &quot;mollyfan&quot;, why not really help me out (and increase the likelihood of me buying from you and leaving you some positive feedback) by actually answering my questions?&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

What I did was mixing the powder in a bottle of water and drink it, ofc it takes a while for it to kick in but it worked :D<br /><br />However, i&#039;ve only tried mdma a couple of times, and I really don&#039;t like snorting anything, so this reply is without a doubt fairly biosed :)<br /><br />When it comes to the dosage, don&#039;t expect that you can take the same amount as you could five years ago, start out slow if possible, I wouldn&#039;t go above 150 mg for starters, and then after an hour has passed you can dose up if needed.<br /><br />Remember i&#039;m a complete newbie though, and I&#039;ve always been extremely worried about the possibility of bad trips, so I like to start out slow and build up the high along the night

				The molly you will find on the road is guaranteed way better then any pressed pill you ate 5 years ago you bought off the street.<br /><br />Read a lot of reviews, there is plenty of info on vendors and lots of roll reports.
