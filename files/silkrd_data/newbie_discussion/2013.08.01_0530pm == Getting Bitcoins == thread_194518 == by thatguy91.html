				You can get Moneypak at Walmart and some vendors will give you BTC for them. But you have to be very cautious, it&#039;s a popular way to get ripped off.

				I would recommend Localbitcoins.<br />I&#039;ve used them twice and had my coins almost instantly. Great escrow system online.<br />They offer both online transactions as well as local meetup transactions if someone near you offers them. They&#039;re a little more pricey if local but you can be guaranteed your coins.<br /><br />Again, Localbitcoins.

				Buy local, in person, with cash.&nbsp; All you need is a cell phone to make the transaction.&nbsp; I like the Blockchain.info iPhone app [probably available on Android also].<br />If you are in a metropolitan area, try Craigslist.&nbsp; That&#039;s where I bought my first few coins.&nbsp; You can even post a &quot;buying BTC&quot; ad in the &quot;wanted&quot; section of CL.<br />Localbitcoins.com is ok, there are some more local sites.&nbsp; You can always try Bitcointalk.org in the currency exchange section, or sell your own [legal] stuff for BTC in the marketplace.&nbsp; Everything from food to servers in there.<br /><br />For a long-term solution, use a verified MtGox account with verified Dwolla account.&nbsp; Only $0.25 transaction fees plus 0.65% commission.&nbsp; Then just transfer your coins out of Gox to a wallet, then another wallet, then a tubmler service, and wala: laundered coins ;).<br /><br />Mr uP.

				also getting coins off the road is risky as hell man , there is no escrow system in place whatsoever for MP and Reloadit transactions as well as here more frequently read the forums scam artists are all over the place....and the fee you pay the vendors is still more than you would for the vendors off localbitcoins and the turnaround time hahahaha no coin vendor on SR has constant turn around times of less than 5 minutes....localbitcoins vendors do man.....the Road is great for other things but not coins and if you read the guides it tells you not to get coins of the road anyway

				www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org<br /><br />Here is a thread discussing the service:<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=237164.0<br /><br />Basically you can walk into any major bank like BofA, Wells, Citi, Chase and deposit cash into an account of a bitcoin seller.<br /><br />No need for ID, no sign ups. Get bitcoin same day.

				if you&#039;re into the idea of sharing your identity, coinbase and btcQuick are two viable options.

				definitely localbitcoins.com is your best option right now afaik<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t bought coins in over 6 months and didn&#039;t know what to do when bitinstant was down.&nbsp; Trust me, localbitcoins is what&#039;s up.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t find someone locally (I couldn&#039;t), there are plenty of cash deposit options available.&nbsp; I paid a 9% premium (+0.003 BTC fee to localbitcoins) to a seller who gave me a Bank of America account number and name, allowing me to anonymously deposit cash into their account.&nbsp; They posted the coins before I even hit &quot;payment sent&quot;.&nbsp; Truly, even easier and cheaper than moneygram and bitinstant was.<br /><br />highly reccomend localbitcoins.com

				Oh, and btw, the listings change on a minute-to-minute basis depending on who&#039;s online.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a lot cheaper when more people are online - I&#039;ve found it&#039;s cheapest when both coasts are active, like 10-2 PST / 1-5 EST

				LOCALBITCOINS!!!!! Seriously it&#039;s the best! I have used bitinstant and even tried coinbase! It&#039;s time to move on from bitinstant. lol. Go to local bitcoins and make an account. I was afraid it was &#039;too good to be true&#039; but it really wasn&#039;t. I found a seller charging 5 dollars more than market and went to bank of america and deposited and when i got home i had the coins in my wallet. Wish you the best!<br /><br />Ryno
