				Hello fellow SR memebers!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So i had a rather pressing question to ask all of you! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; let&#039;s say there&#039;s a reservoir of about 4k or so actavis prometh with codiene 16oz bottles at my disposal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now lets say that we had a tried and true way of stealth shipping in the US only. (international could be tried as we progress)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What would be a decent price that would be fair for all? And would the original bottle be necessary? (i ask for stealth reasons) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also is there a way to test this product? So customers could test themselves to ensure quality and great feedback.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i thank you all for your responses in advance! :D

				When I was younger, I knew someone who had a bottle of this stuff. It was the stuff that Pharmacists use to mix their cough medicines.<br /><br />My friend would mix it with Vodka (no kidding). He would do a shot of pure codeine followed by a shot of vodka and then put both away while we drank beers.<br /><br />He would get quite fucked up on that. <br /><br />Unfortunately for me (or perhaps fortunately) I have opiate resistance -which means it would be a waste if I consumed your stuff. It wouldn&#039;t do anything for me.<br /><br />I would separate the bottle into shots, and then sell the shots for $20 a pop. Because that seems like something people could afford (and no other reason).

				I wouldn&#039;t pay more than $100 for a 16oz bottle. Too much promethazine induces nausea so it&#039;s not the ideal choice for a fat goblet of sizzurp. Bottome line: too much of this stuff for recreational use makes you want to barf.

				personally not a fan of lean but i know where a hidden fountain is lol so i figured id share with the community and see what everyone else thinks id rather not do it by the dose because itd be harder to stealthly ship what i have in mind will only work for 8oz, 16oz, 32oz, etc. so if anyone is interested in bulk id like to know what fair pricing would be $100 is way too low though looking for atleast 2 maybe 25 if people would be okay with that. :-X

				unless u live in North Carolina where the bottling factory is for pints of syrup in Lincolnton i think, then maybe, but id have to sample it first, all this stuff about codeine, is usually fake, and nobody buys in bulk really, maybe like a bottle a two a most, but using the mail ? You can even use a whole pint which is like 16 oz, in some blue box, you would have to go in the USPS post office

				I&#039;d be down. Maaany ppl around here are fiends for that prometh. I&#039;ve always wanted to try it too but do to the large amounts ppl have anything over $100 per 16oz would just be supplying it and there&#039;d be no room for profit. So at the right price I would definitely be down.
