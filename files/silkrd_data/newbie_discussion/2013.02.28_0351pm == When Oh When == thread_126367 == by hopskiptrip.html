				When is this bubble going to burst? I cant be leave in a couple weeks the price for BTC has ballooned. It just crazy so much in such a small time. It is priceing a lot out of the purchace. and what makes it worse is the sellers here seem to keep there price the same not going by market value I have been wanting to order some beans but btc price is the same. Back when bought btc a month ago I believe they were $10 or more each well a seller then had 5 pills for 5btc which was not bad but this same seller through this rise has kept it the same. so say back then five pills for $10 was not bad but now at $32 per pill is insane. Anyway are they just playing it safe and just trying to get the most btc? So when the bubble burst they can still have more btc? I asked one seller why and the replied sorry we corrected it but I think they only took off like 0.03 off! <br />Anyway this just sucks I should have bought at $28 but I was like it is going to drop this is just what markets do. Then When it hit thirty I was really thinking of buying but my gut said no Well fuck me running its up to $32-$34 and who knows if it will be more. Either way this sucks $20+ dollors in a matter of weeks is insane. I just wish I knew more on how to deposit money to get btc and bought a shit load more back then. Fuck it sure would be nice being a dealer with tons of coins I would sell 65% of what ever I had now and save the other 35% for just in case it goes more. I am kicking myself in the ass a few years ago when this was just a dream and it was starting to gain credentials I thought this will go no where. Mining for fake shit no way. All these years I have been folding and I could have been mining. FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKK

				Well it&#039;s part of the game as any currency.<br /><br />I think price are updated automatically according to BTC market value. At least the product i&#039;m tracking seemed to constantly drop in BTC price while the $ value was ballooning.<br /><br />The first time I bought BTC, I ended up missing 0.05 BTC because the BTC was suddenly increasing in price.<br /><br />On the other hand, the opposite is true. I personnally bought a few BTC two weeks ago, and now I can buy products for a lower price.<br />Just do like anyone else, try to keep an eye on the evolution of BTC and adjust your transactions to it.<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t forget that all of this wouldn&#039;t be possible without the anonymity provided by Bitcoins.<br />

				Bitcoins can continue to deflate almost indefinitely. It may be that in future orders are mostly in bitcents instead... I can&#039;t remember exactly how far it goes, but you can get like 0.000001 BTC or something. This is not possible with current physical currency.<br /><br />SR listings are tied to a dollar value and drop in price (as in, the number of BTC being charged will drop) along with the rise in value of BTC. There is an option in setting to change it to display prices to you in dollars on the road.<br /><br />Maybe there are some sellers who are keeping the bitcoin price the same on the road, meaning their prices are really increasing, but I haven&#039;t noticed that. The products I have bought have almost halved in BTC price since I first came here a couple of months ago, and most of the stuff I look at still seems realistically priced (apart from prescription shit, but that doesn&#039;t interest me at all).<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any reason to think it&#039;s a bubble or that it will be bursting any time soon. My only concern would be the SR team getting raided or something and us losing this fantastic resource. I think BTC values would probably take a substantial dip if Silk Road went down.

				I had asked support awhile back about being able to tie it to market and the reply I got said a seller can opt in or out as they choose. I did not want to call out any vendor but here is a example<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/197632fbdb<br />These pills have been the same price since I have been using the road but $24 a pill is out right ridicules but every time I log in it almost always on the first page. So people got to be buying them at this price.

				I know that looks really expensive, and I wouldn&#039;t buy them myself, but if they are as advertised (300+mg per pill) then that&#039;s not ridiculous really. 150-200mg pills sell on the street here for £10 each (about 15 US dollars) so his prices, for the amount of MDMA in them, aren&#039;t that far off. Also, he has other pills listed cheaper, in fact his listing for 10 of those same pills is about £100, which is not too bad at all... if they are as advertised.<br /><br />They are either absolutely banging pills at a normal end user price, or if they aren&#039;t very good then they are way overpriced.

But my point is that was the btc price back when btc was $17-18. I know 5 pills is not bulk but full price for all 5? I dont want to come off as a whiny bitch but I am like a Jew I even use the calc just to run numbers. I do not like to see things in the dollar settings because it is harder to spend.

				Concerning that &quot;bubble&quot; for BTC recently:<br /><br />Isn&#039;t that related to ASIC Bitcoin miner coming to market ? I think Butterfly labs is expecting delivery during march. That&#039;s why the mining market will soon evolve quite a bit.<br /><br />As far as i know, ASIC miners will be much more likely to create more BTCs at least at first. Then difficulty should increase and the BTC price should somehow stabilize. The question is when will it stabilize and at what price ?
