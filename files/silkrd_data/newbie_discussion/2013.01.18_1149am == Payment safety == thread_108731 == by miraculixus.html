				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR and want to place my first order. To minimize my risk I wanted to buy my bitcoins via a Western Union transaction with a fake name (from nanaimogold.com). Unfortunately I recognized that you have to show an ID to send money via WU (at least it is necessary at my local post office).<br /><br />Therefore I didn&#039;t send the money yet, because I&#039;m not sure, if it is safe to buy bitcoins with your real name/ address with Western Union or for example with my personal bank account? So is it safe to buy bitcoins via WU at nanaimogold.com or to transfer it from my real bank account (@bitstamp,net), let them book to my bitcoin address from Silk Road and then shop with this coins? Or is there any possibility to backtrack the money to me with this method and if so, what can I do to avoid this?<br /><br />To be honest this whole Bitcoin thing is quite complicated for me, so it would be great if somebody could answer my question!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Lots of love,<br />miraculixus

				If you live in the States then just walk into any Western Union facility, fill out the paperwork, pay the fee and send your money.&nbsp; WITHOUT giving your real name and WITHOUT showing ID.&nbsp; If you live outside of the U.S. sorry ... no clue what you might be facing.<br /><br />You can also buy BTC from certain SR vendors via cash wired thru WU, just check the Money section on SR (and research vendors carefully).&nbsp; Some take Western Union, others take MoneyGram.<br /><br />Receiving money via WU can also be anonymous too - you can receive up to $1,000 in the States without having to show ID.&nbsp;

				I would never send coins direct to your sr account. The more wallets your bit coins pass through before ending up in your sr account the better. blockchain is a good place to start, they also offer a bit tumbling service to &#039;annonimise&#039; the coins, for a fee.

				Just buy coins under your real name through a variety of bank services, or irl services (see bitinstant), to a wallet somewhere, then just make sure to send them to various online wallets, and use a mixing service, before sending to your SR address.&nbsp;

				I just use bitstamp, but I&#039;m in Ireland, so my options are fairly limited. As long as you&#039;re only buying personal amounts, I&#039;ve figured I&#039;m safe enough after they&#039;re tumbled. I tend to have coins sitting in my account for a while anyway. I know some people are really vigilant about buying in increments and stuff so that deposits can&#039;t be directly/easily traced to how much coin they bought an&#039; all, but seriously cannot be arsed.

				Localbitcoins.com is the way to go. It is very handy if there is someone selling them near enough to you :)

				Put at least one wallet between your point of payment and your SR account. Yes, it means an extra hour or so of wait time. But you may be happy in the future that you did it. Gives you plausible deniability.

It is reliable, but they charge between 1 and 3% commission. I don&#039;t have the URL for it now, but do a search on the forums and you&#039;ll get it.<br /><br />Instawallets are free (www.instawallet.org). I&#039;ve never had a problem with them. Make sure you bookmark the URL for your instawallets as you use them because if you lose it, you won&#039;t be able to get your coins back - this is because the URL is the key to the wallet. Obviously, keep the URL to yourself as well, to prevent anyone from robbing your coin ;)
