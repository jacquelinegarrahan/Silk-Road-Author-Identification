				dear silkroad<br /><br />is there a demand for sniper rifles?<br /><br />to get a good reputation the first rifle sold will be very at a very low price and in germany only. it will cost no more then 800 euro.<br />i will make a good price for the first buyer.<br />if you cant afford that dont even read futher. all the next offers will be much more expensive.<br /><br />first offer will be a rifle with magazine that just gets the job done<br />effective range up to a half kilometer with included sniper scope<br /><br />full ESCROW (SR custom stealth listing or BMR) for this purchase if the buyer is very reputable on the forums or with silkroad history!<br />if you are willing to pay first, you dont need a SR account or a good reputation. i will deliver asap.<br /><br />if i cant get your rifle you get a full refund.<br /><br /><br />when you are still interested please read further.<br /><br />ordering and shipping:<br />first i will take pictures of the rifle to proof.<br />then if the buyer accepts i send the date of the delivery. buyer should be ready to drive on this dates also at night so he can pick it up in a few hours!<br />i deliver the rifle complete in 1 part and send the buyer the gps location and details<br /><br />because the first rifle will be very cheap the buyer must agree to confirm on the forum when he got it.<br /><br />rifle is too large and suspicious to send by mail!<br />if you are not from germany you have to get it to your country yourself.<br /><br />some rules i have to make:<br />please dont say you are interested and then you dont have the money or some other excuse<br />&quot;experts&quot; who want rifles because of some video game please stay away!<br /><br />i can send any proof that does not show my identity<br /><br />if nobody is interested right now, no problem.<br />this offer is valid for a long time because i will buy the rifles only when there is a demand.<br /><br />sorry for all those rules but my profit is low so i want to keep the risk low also!<br /><br /><br />ideas for good dead drop locations appreciated<br /><br /><br />thanks for reading, danke f√ºrs lesen&nbsp; 8)
