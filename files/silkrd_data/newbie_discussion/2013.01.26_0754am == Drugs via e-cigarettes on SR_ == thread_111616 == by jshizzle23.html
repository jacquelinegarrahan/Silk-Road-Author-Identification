				I think you&#039;re looking for hash oil or something like that.<br /><br />Look under the concentrates or hash category for cannabis.

				Buy from some venders who have amazing stealth like walter and 3jane and you&#039;ll find out what real stealth packaging is.

				Hashoil is not suitable for an ecigarette. The oily substance will clog up the vaporizer in no-time. You should probably need some sort of alcohol solution. Maybe a propylene-glycol or glycerine tincture.

				If someone could explain how this works, that would be great. As in which drugs are available to work with this. I go to a lot of football games and this would just rock.<br /><br />I guess the smell of certain things would still be there...right?

They&#039;re sold online and in head shops everywhere. You can buy vials of oil to use with them on SR under the cannabis/concentrates/oils submenu. The smell is there, but certainly less, and with little or no smoke if you do it right. I&#039;ve heard of people using them in lecture halls even! One thing I recommend to everyone who smokes is a portable vaporizer for real bud. The best is the MagicFlite launch box, which can be had online with all the accessories for less than 100$. It&#039;s totally stealthy, your bud goes a long way, it tastes great and is way healthier than smoking. In fact, after using cannabis this way for a while I can&#039;t stand the taste of burned bud anymore, really when I have to burn a traditional bowl I want to puke.

				Maybe I&#039;m thinking wrong on this. I need something that can be smoked out of an e-cig so when I&#039;m at the game people will think I&#039;m just getting my nicotine fix and not getting high.&nbsp; Preferably something that works in the e-cig that looks like a regular cigarette. Know what I mean?

				This is a public forum, I wouldn&#039;t suggest discussing any possible existing/future drug hiding places.&nbsp; If you think it something be done, then look into it offline, and save the rest for the&nbsp; imagination<br />Stay secure
