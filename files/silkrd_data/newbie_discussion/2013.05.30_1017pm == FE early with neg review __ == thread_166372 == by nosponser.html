				Noob here placed a small 3g order of hash and a seasoned vendor is requesting FE<br /><br /><br />My question can I FE early give a temporary 1 of 5 and change it upon receipt? He currently has a&nbsp; perfect rating and has been here a year&nbsp; This way if I am scammed out of my $$ I at least feel I will get my moneys worth.

				If the vendor has a 100 rating and has been here a year, go head and do it.<br /><br />A lot of vendors require FE of people who have less than 3 trades or so. Keeps THEM from getting scammed. Your little 3g order isn&#039;t worth him losing his rep on the forum.

				I would just leave 5/5 and update the feedback after your package arrives (or not). To update, click on account up at the top, then click on view feedback in the sidebar the the right.

				Or order from a vendor who doesn&#039;t require FE. There are many noob friendly vendors who don&#039;t require it.

				If they have a 100% 5/5 rate and have been here a year then I&#039;d say your chances of being scammed for such a small amount are as close to zero as you&#039;ll get.<br /><br />As a rule I won&#039;t (can&#039;t at the moment - it&#039;s against the rules until you have sold 35 things) ask for FE because there isn&#039;t any point, I don&#039;t need the money immediately and can happily wait for the 18 days or whatever it is. So long as I do get the money in the end and everybody is happy!

				Why would you even leave feedback before you get your item? Just don&#039;t submit feedback until you have it. Simples.

				Thanks guys for all the replies , I am so eager to pop my cherry here,I want to believe that if I break the rules , it will be different for me , this just reminds me of the give me the money and ill be right back out and the guy runs out the back door, street scam transaction, Oh well&nbsp; first vendor I tried just canceled my order after 3 days w no reply and there was no indication on his vendor page he does not accept newbie customers.Another 100% w over 300+ transaction in 4 mos. I did notice all his prices were adjusted by a few .01bitcoins after the holiday and thought maybe he cancelled all for a price adjustment? Either way this board/market introduced me to bitcoins and I think they are going to take off even more as they become more and more popular so even if I never buy anything off here , I found a whole new internet again....
