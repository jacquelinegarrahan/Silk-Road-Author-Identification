				Hi everyone!<br /><br />I just opened this account because nobody seems to leave feedback for my friend SunWu, they must be on their asses from his top notch product :)<br />Well here is my review for others to make informed decisions and to give some love and appreciation to SunWu, my favorite opiate vendor.<br /><br />1.Vendor: SunWu is a gentleman and will look after you at all times, once a shipment got lost and Sunwu offered a solution more than fair and very generous so rest assured you will be looked after. He ships quickly and only marks in transit, when it is actually in transit.<br /><br />2.The Product: I`ve only tried the pure Fentanyl Citrate and I must say for someone with a LARGE Tolerance (to get smashed i`d iv 240mg oxycodone) his stuff is THE Bomb. I do not doubt a second it is indeed &gt;98% pure, just a tiny bit ~25mg diluted in 10ml of water give roughly 10-15 awesome iv doses, but thats me and my tolerance. The powder dissolves in seconds in cold water and is a joy to work with. For an opiate native person it would likely be more than 50 or more doses. There`s no doubt in my mind his other products are exactly as advertised, since he clearly has the pure stuff :) <br />The 100mg last me around 5 times as long as any other comparable opioid on the road within the same price range so his deal is awesome for any opiate lover. The $/dose ratio and purity of the product make it imo the best opiate offer on sr, no doubt, trust me :) I was also very surprised how long the legs of this product are, sure the Nod doesnt last as long as H as example but after a dose of this fent I`d be well for easy 10hours before my body screams more. I do have a slow metabolism but still this is longer than I expected.<br /><br />3. Stealth:&nbsp; SunWu`s Stealth is top notch, not the best I`ve ever seen but 9/10 and from the outside his letter looks and feels just like any business mail and except for the one mentioned (which probably just got lost like other mail does) all of his shipments made it into my sunny, hard to ship to - land of oz ;)<br /><br />Have fun and stay safe, especially with a low tolerance and this stuff :)<br /><br /><br />LONG LIVE THE ROAD !!!<br /><br />

				I ordered the fentanyl nasal spray from SunWu.<br /><br />overall, i&#039;m pretty happy with the product. it seems like SunWu&#039;s products are pretty widely regarded as one of the best values for opiates on SR. my nasal spray is wonderful; it lasts longer than i expected, and is much stronger than i expected as well. having only tried a couple of fentanyl patches before, i think the spray is wonderful.. terrific value. <br /><br />the only thing i was disappointed in, was that the spray bottle leaked inside the package... and in the fact that it seems like everyone else whose spray bottles leaked, got offered compensation on the next order, except me -- or so it seems from the reviews anyway. maybe it&#039;s because i just mentioned the leaking in a calm message without demanding anything in return, i dont know... it&#039;s just a little disappointing that it seems that SO many others got offered replacements for what they lost via the leaking. i guess since i didnt lose half the contents of the bottle, i &quot;basically sort of&quot; got my money&#039;s worth, but i think i&#039;ll be ordering the powder and making my own spray next time. i love the spray, but i dislike losing what i pay for to funky packaging, and it definitely leaked enough that the inside of the packaging was all wet.

				I&#039;ve also just ordered some of the &#039;synthetic heroin&#039; (fent/lact mix) and cant wait to try it also.. sounds strong and as mentioned above this could be a cheaper way to control what can be a costly habit! <br /><br />Anyone that has experience with this.. can you tell me how long a gis likely to last. I&#039;ve been told by SunWu 10mg bumps should do.. does this sound correct for someone with a high tolerance?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				I&#039;ve ordered from SunWu on Monday but still waiting for my delivery at the moment&nbsp; :( one thing I will say is that SW communication is great and I have been kept fully informed each day practically, this makes all the difference. I have no doubt we will resolve this situation if not received. As soon as i do get my order, I&#039;ll make sure I review on the forum. I bought a g before and was really pleased with it, which is what prompted me to purchase more!&nbsp; 8)

				Fentanyl is 100 times more potent than morphine so if it was really 98% pure it would be killing people. Not saying it isn&#039;t everything people in this thread have said it is but let&#039;s not go crazy here about purity. It would have to be cut just to keep from killing people.

				Hello dear SRlers,<br /><br />first of all, this message is meant as a reply to this thread (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=194881.0). The reason why I am posting this here is simply because I do not have submitted 50 forum posts so far, and rather would not like to spam the forums just to reach those.<br /><br />So here&#039;s my experience with SunWu and his Fentanyl Citrate offers:<br /><br />I have seeked Fentanyl for a long time, since I figured it was the only medication that is actually able to ease my unbelievably intense lower back pain. My doctor had prescribed it to me once - with great success indeed - but after I told him that I had a history of opioid abuse, he was no longer willing to prescribe the transdermal patches to me - obviously fearing that I would try to abuse them by chewing them up or whatever. That&#039;s why I never again was prescribed a medication that actually worked - for chronic as well as breakthrough pain.<br /><br />I should add that, before this situation of intense desperation, I had only ever bought drugs from local suppliers. I had indeed heard about SR before, but never considered buying there due to doubts about how secure it actually was. Well, but imagine this situation I was in now: I had found a med that worked for me, but my damn doctor was no longer willing to prescribe it to me, just because from almost ten years ago I had a record of opioid abuse.<br /><br />That was why, after consulting a few friends about my concerns regarding SR, I finally decided to join this market.<br />After reading the requirements of most vendors, I noticed, that pretty much no vendor would accept new customers that did not have at least 10 successful transactions completed on SR. On SunWu&#039;s vendor page I did not find such a hint, so I decided to give it a try.<br />To my very surprise, only a few days later I found a letter with 1g of the &quot;Synthetic Heroin&quot; in my letterbox. Being an honest customer, of course I immediately finalized, hoping to be able to build some trust for further transactions.<br />After successfully testing this product, I decided to go for the more expensive (but still affordable) pure Fent. Citrate, 100mg. I made a nasal spray out of it, which worked astonishingly well for breakthrough pain as well as - dosed regularly and in low doses - for my chronic pain..<br /><br />It did not take long until I placed a few more orders. I am now still convinced that SunWu&#039;s Fentanyl offers are THE REAL DEAL. If you compare the amount you get for your money to the offers you find on SR for 100mcg/hr patches, you will soon realize that SunWu is simply unbeatable in that regard.<br /><br />Well, after praising this vendor so much, I understand I may raise the suspicion that I am biased in some way. So let me tell you that I am in NO WAY affiliated to SunWu, but I&#039;m simply a pain patient who has finally found relief thanks to this vendor. I do really, really hope that he will last a long, long time.<br /><br />Now another story where I am still not quite sure what think about it. A couple days ago I found a letter in my mailbox containing 250mg Fentanyl Citrate. It should be added that I had NOT ordered anything beforehand. Our only communication before said letter arrived was me asking why all the UK Fent Citrate offers had been taken down, and stating that I would like to order another 100 or 200mg soon. Believe it or not, a few days later I found the said letter in my letterbox containing 250mg of Fentanyl Citrate. I sent him a message asking if this was a mixup and stating that I had already received and left feedback for my recent order. But his reply to my message left me with the impression that this was an intentional and unbelievably generous treat that I had just received.<br /><br />I still did not quite get over it, and all I can say is THANK YOU SO MUCH! It allows me to prepare my own nasal spray and successfully fight my pain. I AM SPEECHLESS.<br /><br />So, to draw a conclusion about my experiences with SunWu:<br />This vendor is a human being deserving my unlimited gratitude.<br />We have not exchanged a lot of PMs, all our communication was very &quot;compressed&quot; in the sense that we focused on the important content, but still incredibly polite and understanding.<br />SunWu is my recommendation to anyone seeking a vendor who does actually care about his customers and is willing to help wherever he can.<br /><br />One more comment I have. Surely everybody purchasing Fentanyl in its pure form should be aware of what he/she is dealing with. If this is your first time dealing with this material, make sure that you have protective clothing at hand, wear protective gloves and safety glasses. Once you developed a feeling for how potent this material is and you have developed some tolerance, it&#039;s up to you to abandon parts of this equipment.<br /><br />BE SAFE!<br /><br />All the best,<br />knockforebee

				The citrate version sure is awesome. I am going to switch to the hcl though, a bit more expensive but stronger, more soluble, hopefully more bang for your buck. Not that the citrate doesn&#039;t have a hell of a lot of bang for your buck either. I would be interested to hear from someone who has tried both and can compare the two. <br /><br />For the person who thought that it must not be pure, otherwise it would be killing people, I can tell you that it is indeed pure and great caution must be given, otherwise you would be right.

I order lets say for example 100mg fent--it comes in a little baggie, its fluffy white powder.<br /><br />I have a glass nasal spray bottle with a plastic top.&nbsp; I find this kind is best: (clearnet) <br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.cheyee-cn.com/products/03_mist_spray_bottles/01_nasal_spray_bottles/02_PET_Nasal_Spray_Bottles.JPG <br /><br />(end clearnet)<br /><br />&nbsp;Just google around til you find some company who sells them; or alternatively you can go to the drug store and buy a bottle of saline or other kind of nasal spray and just empty it out and clean it and use that (you want to avoid stuff that has a lot of weird ingredients or mentholated stuff in it IMO).&nbsp; I prefer transparent bottles so I can see what Im doing, how much is left, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />The most important things in choosing a bottle are a)the bottle&#039;s top/spray mechanism can be screwed off and removed entirely, so you can clean it and fill it, b) the bottle releases measured doses (this is why I like the kind of bottle above), and c) The capacity of the bottle, and the number of sprays per bottle, is CLEARLY printed on the box so you know exactly how many fl ozs, or ml or whatever measurement of liquid, it holds.<br /><br />While you&#039;re at it buy some saline.&nbsp; I just use the kind for contact lenses, without preservatives, but you can make your own with salt and water.&nbsp; You need to use mostly saline because plain water gets really uncomfortable in your sinuses (remember getting water up your nose in the pool as a kid?), and saline is much more comfortable.<br /><br />The important part: mixing your spray.<br /><br />The safest way to do this is just to empty the whole packet into the bottle, then you&#039;ll divide the total mgs by the amount of sprays in the bottle and that will tell you what the dose is per spray.&nbsp; So 100mg in a bottle with 200 sprays is 500mcg per spray.<br /><br />If you want to buy bigger amounts of fent in the first place (cuz its cheaper in bulk) or use a smaller amount per spray, either buy a bigger bottle (100 mg divided by 400 sprays is 250mg per spray) or use a smaller amount of fent in the bottle to begin with.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can do the latter by measuring out a smaller amount from your bag of fent (unreliable without a really expensive scale); or by eyeballing it (also very unreliable, but after doing this for awhile you&#039;ll get a sense of what 25mg or 50 mg looks like, and because you are preparing something with 200+ doses if you are off by even 10mg it wont really affect each dose in a huge way.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I still wouldn&#039;t eyeball until you have done this for awhile and know what kind of tolerance and dose leeway your body has.&nbsp; If you&#039;re new to this method just buy the amount of fent you want to put in the whole bottle.&nbsp; A good place to start IF you already have an opiate tolerance is 125 or 250mcg per spray. <br /><br />If you dont already have an opiate tolerance, just don&#039;t do this at all.&nbsp; Buy the blotters or the mannitol mix or something.&nbsp; You need to have enough of a tolerance where if you&#039;re off by a few hundred micrograms per dose it wont kill you.<br /><br />Finally, once you&#039;ve figured out the measurements its time for the mixing itself.&nbsp; I fill my bottle about halfway with saline, drop the powder in carefully, put just a little bit of super hot water in there, and then fill the rest with saline.&nbsp; The hot water helps with dissolving, I&#039;ve found, and you can add up to 10-15% water in the bottle without hurting your sinuses if the rest of the bottle is saline. <br /><br />Then screw/attach the spray mechanism (hopefully with its cap still on) until its totally on there tight, and shake it up until you cant see any particles floating around anymore.<br /><br />That&#039;s it!&nbsp; Let me know if you have any Qs. <br /><br />PS with this method I find I need at least 5 mins to let it kick in all the way, and the first dose sometimes more like 10.&nbsp; Subsequent doses kick in faster.&nbsp; But either way when they do kick in their kick in hard, with a nice warm glow and relief from pain.&nbsp; So don&#039;t overdo it and respray until you&#039;re sure enough time has passed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I have been doing this with citrate and I just tried it with the HCL, which works well except it takes a bit to dissolve fully (maybe an hour or so total, with intermittent shaking).<br /><br />The main difference with the HCL is not only is it stronger but it seems to kick in WAY faster and harder, and its easy to underestimate and do too much.&nbsp; I would therefore recommend using the citrate for most people, unless your tolly is really sky high and you need each spray to be as strong as possible.&nbsp; Either way start with the citrate until you get really comfortable with the whole process, both making and dosing.&nbsp;
