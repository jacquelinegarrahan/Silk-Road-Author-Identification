				Ringo is a new vendor selling DMT he synths himself. I have an order for 200mg in, and FE&#039;ed to show I trusted him to people. Speaking to him about his product, I could tell he is a legit DMT shaman (he makes a vehicle for exploring realities... other dimensions... he is a modern-day medicine man). I am not worried about FE&#039;ing the transaction at all. I should see his DMT (he provided me with free shipping updates despite me choosing the cheapest shipping option) in a day or two. I call it &quot;his DMT&quot; very intentionally. His energy goes into his DMT. I can tell he has good energy. I look forward to the privilege of being worthy to partake of his &#039;medicine&#039; and experience re-birth through it. I will be smoking a dose with two friends... then dosing with a MAOI by myself. Look for a full report very soon....<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				i have yet to experience this batch of DMT myself (wasted some using the &quot;foil&amp;straw&quot; a.k.a. &quot;chasing the dragon&quot; method).. my new, good friend used a filtering flask to vape some yesterday and got a &quot;++&quot; i&#039;d estimate (she&#039;s innocent, part of what i like about her... i&#039;m so jaded, she balances me). i am about to take a jab at the resin left in the flask....<br /><br />otherwise, we&#039;re getting some Syrian Rue seeds and going for the long trip next week!<br /><br />and Ringo... your energy is in this DMT. if the cartels were selling DMT, i would not want it... it would be filled with dirty blood-money (energy-wise). so, don&#039;t be so modest, F.xy Ringo (in grey.fox.productions, &quot;F.xy&quot; is equal to &quot;Mister&quot;... &quot;xy&quot; being the male chromosomes. a female is a &quot;F.xx&quot;... again, &quot;xx&quot; equal female chromosomes. a &quot;FØx&quot; is someone who is of the third gender... &quot;Ø&quot; is the symbol for neutrois; honestly what i am, but it seemed to me that it might appear being called &quot;FØx&quot; meant i was special... g.f.p. has no heroes or heroines... just Heroin and equals).<br /><br />back from a visit to another place (fingers crossed) in a few...<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy<br /><br />peace&amp;love,<br />~f.xy

I am not that happy; but, my fiance committed suicide two years, one week, and one day ago. Yesterday would have been her 26th birthday. Yes, she killed herself a week before her 24th birthday. I try to be as happy as I can be... it just is hard sometimes. I feel guilty saying that... I am blessed and take so much for granted... But, material things do not bring happiness (unless the material thing is a narcotic... then you get a glimpse of happiness); relationships do. My fiance killed herself, greed caused my male best-friend to turn on me, jealousy and craziness caused my female best-friend to ice me out, and my parents have &quot;compassion fatigue&quot; at this point. Work is my favorite place to be... I am appreciated and can help people there. I love it.<br /><br />I made what I thought was a positive post on FB earlier.

				A copy of the message I sent Ringo about yesterday....<br /><br />Yesterday, we dosed 750 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe each... and went out and bought three big cans of whipped cream with my food stamps (haha... i took a picture of my purchase on the self-checkout stand... three cans of whipped cream and a thing of sprite, the 25c causes nausea). we blasted off and as we blew out our last hit each, hit nitrous. it was indescribable. and my friend laid her head on my chest. i got to experience death in the arms of someone who has given me nothing but positive energy. it was the most connected i&#039;ve ever felt to another person. she chose to cuddle with me when she blasted off. we ended up drinking later and watching a movie.... made-out. she&#039;s 20 and a virgin (thought those only existed in middle-school, didn&#039;t you? ha)... i&#039;m a man-whore; i&#039;ve literally sold my body to both sexes (and to a really hot girl one time actually) as well as a brief career as a stripper (the half-way house made me quit, who would have thought?). i&#039;ve been date-raped by two girls (twice by one). my view of sex is FUCKED. i&#039;m honest with my friend though; and she appreciates it and is helping me keep things at a healthy pace. seriously, my late fiance and i did speedballs once... and after 15 minutes and the &quot;rush&quot; subsiding looked at each other and asked, &quot;were we just fucking like crazy? you felt that too?&quot; there was a foot of space between us. with my new friend, yesterday i felt like cuddling with her was like &quot;making love&quot; and wanted a cigarette after. so different, but similar. narcotics resulted in a shared feeling of FUCKING (primal, physical) while the psychedelics resulted in a shared feeling of MAKING LOVE (emotional, tender).<br /><br />i am re-ordering my &quot;Fireball&quot; supplies today (and i think my friend wants some more of your DMT, she loves it and i feel 100% okay with her doing it... not like an old friend who loved my 3-MeO-PCP IV....); and i know that i will be able to put the needle down after i do it. I KNOW IT. and your DMT has played a major part in this.<br /><br />thank you so much, my friend.... you&#039;ve helped me return from the dead.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Lots-of-Love,<br />~f.xy<br /><br />P.S.- blasted off yesterday AM by myself... here&#039;s what i wrote:<br /><br />DMT philosophy....<br /><br />patterns are present with the CEVs. what are patterns but habits? what are habits but rules? what are rules but laws? this is why mankind shirks away from anarchy as a whole. i do not know what political system is best; other than &quot;narco&quot; should be included in the word.<br /><br />back to the beautiful, unspoiled laws inside my eyelids....<br /><br />a government&#039;s only role should be providing nutritious food, adequate shelter, medical care, justice, and drugs (both narcotics and psychedelics) to those who can&#039;t take care of providing themselves with those thing.

				My review of Ringo Deathstarr &#039;s DMT:<br /><br />Shipping was very quick , Stealth was great, same goes as pricing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve wasted a good amount of money trying to vape DMT. Quick rundown for anyone that needs to break through, try this:<br /><br />-Glass Vapor Genie<br />-Hemp Wick (instead of using a lighter,just use this!)<br /><br />I loaded it up with 8 screens, a tiny bit of mullein, I then loaded 40mg on TOP of the filter instead of the screens! My first time every doing this and I broke through. <br /><br />I&#039;ve almost broke through other times from other peoples DMT, just had some light visuals,but today..wow.. <br /><br />I put on The Doors,load up 40mg in my GVG, sat up in my bed and had a glass of water for my throat and to put out the wick. First 2 hits were super smooth and not hot at all, I held both hits in for 20 seconds. I start feeling the calming effects now. The third hit I took the biggest vape I could, and hold it in till I had to cough it all out. It starts coming on heavy, I throw the wick in the glass, and I notice how insanely loud the wick going out is. Lay back on the bed, I glance at the windows, and goodbye world. <br /><br />In 5 seconds, I went from smooth to another dimension. All the fibers in my blanket seem incredibly tall, my bed is getting longer, the walls in my room expand out and seem like they want to burst and turn gray colors. Outside is just like WTF. The trees jump to my window, rainbow patterns are coming out of the air, everything turns into this insane rainbow cartoon pattern filled world. There was no more air, just patterns floating around everywhere. Everything just so complex. <br /><br />Length was about 5-7 minutes. <br /><br />I just..am still in awe over what I experienced today. I&#039;ve read about so many peoples breakthroughs, but until you witness it yourself you have no idea how it truly is. 2cb,mushrooms,lsd...pshhh... I didn&#039;t truly think DMT was intense enough to make those seem like nothing,but in my experience it is.<br /><br />-Only downside I could think of , was just like all psychedelic&#039;s.After the use I&#039;m just wondering what to do in life after experiencing something so beautiful. <br /><br />Bottom line. This is great stuff, from a great vendor. If you have never broke through on DMT, it&#039;s worth every penny to keep trying. <br />And if your going to spend it, then this is the guy you want to try it from.

				You put the DMT on top of the GVG heat diffuser? I have a GVG for DMT and have never tried that before. <br />I also just happen to have some of Ringo&#039;s Deemster. I have to try that out. Thanks for the tip.

				Sickboy try it out! Just get it to melt a bit first before you start taking hits off&nbsp; of it. Ever since I have tried it hat way, it&#039;s worked 100%. Even my friend broke through on his first time ever trying DMT doing that method. Biggest thing is just melting it first in the filter and then your set.

				Yeah the conical filter.<br /><br />For me it hasn&#039;t clogged one bit. I think as long as you don&#039;t burn it with a flame your fine. And there are ways of cleaning it. I also read somewhere else that there are places to buy the filter much cheaper. Heck, if a filter costs 2-3 bucks somewhere else and it lasts for 6 months, its worth it to me.

				Awesome sickboy! Hope the experience was great!&nbsp; Yeah I&#039;ve tried DMT in other vapes as well, and man the GVG is sooo smooth on the throat and not hot at all.. I just love it. <br /><br />Hell, me and my friend both brokethrough on little as 15-20mg using the GVG and that technique.<br /><br />Now if I could only get the breakthroughs to last a bit longer..so far I only get 4-5 minutes max.&nbsp;

				Pink, everyone told me to get the GVG, I didn&#039;t listen... after a good amount of wasted $$$ I tried the GVG.. <br /><br />I love it. Breaking through is never a problem anymore.

				I actually don&#039;t really have a problem breaking through anymore after my first 2 times.&nbsp; I&#039;ve pretty much got my dosage down, and I always breakthrough. I feel it probably would give a clearer experience though with the GVG...&nbsp; They are kind of pricey though.&nbsp; Would I need the sherlock or would the just the bat version suffice?&nbsp; Another thing that worries me is I don&#039;t have a mg scale, so I am worried that the GVG will destroy me with my normal dosage lol...&nbsp; I guess I should start small.

				Ahh ok. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the others. I have only used the GVG. One thing that is nice about the glass is you can see the vape smoke. <br /><br />Why not just buy a scale? You can get some decent ones for 30 bucks. What I do is buy some of those small mg scoops (you can find them cheap on ebay for a couple bucks) . Then I&#039;ll see how many scoops it is for 30,50mg,etc.. with the scoops I find it very easy to eyeball it after I know how much each scoop comes to weigh out..<br /><br />Sadly for me, I still suck with GVG..even though I&#039;m breaking through all the time I&#039;m positive I am not doing it 100% right after seeing my friend use it. I&#039;m sure once I start getting the technique down correctly the breakthroughs should be more intense.
