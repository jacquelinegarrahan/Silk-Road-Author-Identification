				Hey y&#039;all,<br /><br />I had an order placed with &quot;subsrgood&quot; and the order got cancelled this AM. He has no listings up now. I need China White for my &quot;Fireball&quot; and his #4 was phenomenal. I don&#039;t want to waste my money with anyone else. 25mgs of his stuff was enough for me to feel (a whole 100mg of the local BTH doesn&#039;t touch me)... I have my Girl coming from &quot;kirbynose&quot;, but I need my Boy from &quot;subsrgood&quot;!!! Ahhhh!!! Anyone know where he went or why my order may have been cancelled?<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy

				Sad to hear... hope nobody died or is in jail. I&#039;ll be sending positive vibes his way.<br /><br />I ordered from &quot;Terabithia&quot; and got two stamp bags... &quot;subsrgood&quot; was a great vendor and hooked it up fat (160mg when I ordered 100mg) as well as warning me not to shoot 100mg at once with OxyM, Coke, Ritty and having taken K-pins and Soma. It&#039;s good he sent the extra 60mg... I tried 25mgs and felt it. I don&#039;t feel a thing from the &quot;good&quot; 100mg BTH bags around here.<br /><br />Anyone know how the two vendors stuff compares?<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love (especially to &quot;subsrgood&quot;),<br />~f.xy
