				Just from busted convicts? But what about the drugs from everyone else who weren&#039;t convicts? Does the DEA just ingest all of those or..

				Seriously, although an IT guy myself, you can do a bit of Googling and get a fair idea of how the routing works with Tor. If you&#039;re not providing an exit relay (and I&#039;m not suggesting you don&#039;t), you are as free as a bird without traceability. Remember institutions such as banks rely on the same technology we are using here to remain anonymous. &#039;I&#039;m from the DEA and I&nbsp; know what&#039;s going on&#039; comments may be true - I too know what&#039;s going on.. technology is miles ahead of authorities. <br /><br />No doubt congress could pass a blanket law to make Tor illegal (no point to make SR illegal as it resides randomly within Tor). If they do this, it would be somewhat sad, but all you have to do is Google Tor alternatives to understand that non-DNS alternative routed hidden networks are here to stay. If Tor goes, or rather is made illegal in the US, the alternatives will be plentiful.

				Plus the government relies on tor for soooo much. The government started tor, funds tor, and uses it all the time. The military and intelligence agencies couldn&#039;t function without it. They won&#039;t stop funding it until some other anonymizing routing network that is superior to tor comes along.<br /><br />I read on the tails forums that 38% of exit traffic is run by a just a handful of high powered relayz, and some of those could easily be the Government in some form, seeing as how navy started tor and its still funded by the US govt. SO USE MULTIPLE FORMS OF ENCRYPTION AMONG OTHER THINGS AND BE SAAAFFEEE.

				Totally titsmcgee123! Even PGP is quite a reasonable form of encryption I still don&#039;t get vendors who suggest it as &#039;an option&#039;. It&#039;s simple - easy. Even if SR, Tor were to be infiltrated, which is not a remote possibility right now, use PGP as a point-to-point communication method. It&#039;s so easy, free, and keeps our own peace of mind.

				Privnote goes through third-party servers. They claim the rerecords are destroyed - they well may be, but you have no way to prove this. If you encode with a user&#039;s pubic PGP key, only that user&#039;s priate key (not even yours) can decrypt the message you have sent. In short.. Privnote.. Secure, they say. PGP.. secure, you know. I know which I choose every time. <br /><br />I challange anyone to accept a PGP encrypted message from me and decrypt it - you basically will not.&nbsp; The point is, use PGP, even SR cannot decrypt the point to point, or user to user messages sent.
