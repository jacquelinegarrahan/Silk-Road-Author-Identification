				Numbers are on the card. <br /><br />Be O so careful when using money packs. Sugarmama is trusted and well respected but thats the only person I would do money pack transactions with. <br /><br />There is no way to protect yourself with those and green dot will not help you if you willingly give your money pack info to a scammer. So just be careful.

				The numbers are under the scratch-off on the back. And yes be very cautious with these. I would only use them as an absolute last resort.

				Hmm. Well I couldn&#039;t tell you then. I&#039;ve only used them twice (not for BTC) and there was a scratch off on the back of the card.

Yea, some stores do that with the pre-paid cell phone cards too. The information is on the receipt but not the card. It is supposed to be for security. Not 100% sure but it sounds like it. <br /><br />Try asking the store you brought it from what number do you use to put the money on your card. <br /><br />Sorry I couldn&#039;t be more help. Cards I got always had the scratch off on the back.

				i also say sugarmama is the only exchanger i would recomend, and the number your looking for is NOT on the receipt. It is on the backside of the GreenDot Money Pak card, under a gray scratch off area. You must scratch it with your fingernail , then you will see the number. Many people have been ripped off on a moneypak to btc, i have used sugarmama many times i have never heard anything bad about her service. Good luck
