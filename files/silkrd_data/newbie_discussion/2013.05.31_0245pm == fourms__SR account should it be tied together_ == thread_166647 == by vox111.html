				Just an idea and not sure if it even applies or is possible but with a few other sites i have worked on i was thinking it might be a good idea that <br />for ones fourm account&nbsp; to become a member ,instead of writing 50 posts to get to &quot;talk&quot; in the big kids section have your fourm account tied to your Sr buying account and have a posting limit according to the member areas based on money spent or something of the like. just a idea from someone buzzed. after reading the rumor mill i see a trend of possible fake or superbiased entries and it would be nice to know if they are legit or come from someone who say actually didnt have dummy or mult accounts or Leo&#039;s.

				though the benefits from a usability perspective would be nice I think it would add a whole lot of risk to accounts from exposing more information than people want.<br />its nice to be able to discuss things here, expose a little information and know it cannot be technically linked with actual illegal dealings.<br /><br />through the powers of deduction, manipulation and general investigation you could discover a lot about someone by reading all their posts on here... lets not give LE more information than they already have.

				good points i hadnt thought of.&nbsp; maybe something where once you create an account and have bought say 5-10 items then you can enter a new section of these fourms with a new account sent to you via tormail.&nbsp; with a list of reviews only and have a strict guideline on what could be mentioned. maybe have it where once a vendor gets a review thread SR could send you a code that can access you to be able to post in it .or maybe some variation of these ideas i find that many of the top listed selling items getting bashed saying shit is bunk ect just think maybe one or two more hoops to jump through might be a good idea.

				i believe there is no need to do that, as long as you can create unlimited amount of users anyway. :)

				I think there is a lot of value to being able to talk/ask questions over here without having to have it taint your activities on SR. I would always rather someone ask a stupid question anonymously over here then do something stupid over there because they were afraid to ask. <br /><br />That being said, my usernames are the same on both :-)
