				It seems SO hard to find legitimate cocaine on the road. Anything mostly &quot;Real&quot; will likely be 150-180 and I accept that (per gram). Has anyone sampled a large majority of vendor cocaine? From my research, it seems Sukey, Symbiosis, and Nod all have excellent coke, Sukey perhaps the best. Anyone have any input?

				depends where you are and if you&#039;re ok with international. from personal experience there&#039;s only a few left i&#039;d order from. in order of preference:<br /><br />Bungee54<br />LloydsBrothers<br />BudWorx UK<br /><br />Budworx&#039;s coke is slightly better than LB&#039;s but it took over a week for a domestic delivery, only had to wait 2 days for LB&#039;s, and there&#039;s not much in it really quality wise. Bungees is the best though and only a 3 day delivery if you&#039;re in the EU.<br /><br />if you&#039;re in the States Kirby, Studio54 and GodOfAll are supposed to have cracking gear.<br /><br />Koltbiz is supposed to be great, but i&#039;ve lost a lot of money through him so he can keep it. WhiteDreams is supposed to be awesome as well but minimum order is an ounce and you have to FE<br /><br />keep up to date on the coke vendors thread in the rumor mill is your best bet mate

				been meaning to try Sukeys but haven&#039;t got round to it yet, and after PineAppleLoves been sending samples to test labs in Holland Bungees is coming out at 87% out of a possible 89%, so i&#039;m happy with that - is another Â£20 worth an extra % or 2 in purity?

				Hi my friend we currently have A-1 Cocaine in stock and ship from the UK. We also have samples in stock so you can test the quality yourself... if that&#039;s too long take a look at our feed back to re-assure yourself. We have 0.2 0.5 and 1g listings.&nbsp; Larger orders are available buy request. Happy Shopping!<br /><br />mrhendrix<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9fddd412b1
