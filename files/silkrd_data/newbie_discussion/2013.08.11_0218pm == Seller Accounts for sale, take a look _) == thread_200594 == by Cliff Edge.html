				Vendors shouldn&#039;t be allowed to sell accounts.<br />Your account is your REP and Identity and it&#039;s quite low to allowed these to be traded as commodity&#039;s.<br /><br />At least that&#039;s the view Atlantis takes when it comes to selling vendor accounts

				You would be buying nothing cuz evry1 would know it was sold and the feedback couldn&#039;t be trusted any longer. It would just destroy the rep of the seller account. I think giving it to a reliable person with your same business ethic that you actually know would be the only time a transfer of a seller acct would seem legit to me.<br /><br />Smells bad, nobody gonna bite.

				that is very dangerous for it to be allowed because if you are buying certain products from certain vendors that are consider &quot;harder&quot; substances and one vendor has one quality and potency and than sells his account to another vendor who has something different that could harm his loyal customers in a very negative manner, im just saying i understand the whole liberty and freedom approach and i agree 150% with it but i think vendors should at least have to be held to some sort of standard to atleast notify its customers of the switch because seller A might be a loyal SR traveler and is dedicated to the success where as seller B might give to shits and if seller B got his hands on an awesome account say one ranked in the top 1% .....i could only imagine the scam that would create and the amount of money lost....just saying im kinda of wary about that

I don&#039;t know if you read The Road to Serfdom but in the book, Hayek writes that the government has a role to play in the economy through the monetary system, work-hours regulation, institutions for the flow of proper information, and other principles on which most members of a free society will tend to agree. <br /><br />We at Atlantis would argue that regulating the sale of vendor accounts and removing posts created to intentionally cause fear/uncertainty/doubt among people on the forums&nbsp; comes under &quot;institutions for the flow of proper information&quot;<br />While it must make it easier to operate Silk Road with such light touch regulation, for the buyer this only makes the risks of being taken advantage of higher. If we want to survive prosper and defeat the war on drugs then we need to foster a community of trust and people turning their personal reputation into a commodity to us flies in the face of trust. ( I think even your original DPR might have agreed on that )<br /><br />libertarians often fail to recognize the Achilles heel of their own otherwise very appealing philosophy:its doctrinaire disregard for any commonly-shared conception of the good of society at which we should aim, not only as individuals, but as people.&nbsp; &nbsp;This weakness exists because libertarians imagine there are only two players in the political game - the coercive state at the top and free individuals at the bottom but reality is far more complicated than that because in the middle you have relationships between people in a civil society who look out for one another. <br /><br />Atlantis has no problem stepping in to make sure buyers and vendors don&#039;t turn their personal reputation into a commodity to be bought or sold.<br />

				Interesting arguments from libertas, heisenberg2.0 and n0nc3s, certainly had me questioning my libertarian principles, no system is perfect and I can see some of both sides of the table, however IRL businesses change hands all the time and their online accounts and reps would no doubt go with them,<br />After careful consideration I&#039;m in the libertas camp. If I was purchasing one of these accounts, I would probably list on my seller page, Under new management, or words to that effect, after all I&#039;m not out to deceive anyone.

Otherwise I&#039;m with Heisenberg on the fact it&#039;s not right to sell &quot;Good rep&quot; for over $1500<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think you misunderstand, this unused account has a 11btc unclaimed bond attached, thats not the price im selling it for, eg. its worth $1400?(approx) when you claim the bond after so many sales and meet bond requirements then you get the 11 btc bond back, im open to offers and ill accept a fair bit less.<br /><br />Thanks for the interesting comments, it doesnt seem favoured selling accounts, but theres no harm that i can see and as said stating &quot;under new management&quot; is a honest approach to taking over a seller account.<br /><br />And buying a used account for history is worthless, these are old accounts and all history is no longer listed.<br />

My beef with selling accounts is that it would be far to easy for LE to buy these accounts and harvest addresses.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That was my first thought as well, although they could set up a new account and get some addresses as well,however I don&#039;t they would send out product, as the liability would be pretty high on there part&nbsp; for example a 15 year old kid ordered it an OD&#039;d&nbsp; (I could be wrong here, as those jack booted thugs sell guns to the cartels, and whoever else wanted them).&nbsp; I think they like to know who they are selling to first.&nbsp; either way point being they would not get much because word would spread and people wouldn&#039;t order.<br /><br />And lets face it they are not after the end users, they like to go big, up the chain, I believe they mostly rely on old fashioned police work to bust people, the road is not where most of the drugs are sold, and it is pretty difficult to track people (not impossible, but why would they bother when they can get joe dealer picking up his load for the week from joe bigger dealer in person), and have a much more solid case than proving computer ip trails etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is a little off point, I think that selling a vendor account is OK as long as it is made clear it has been sold.
