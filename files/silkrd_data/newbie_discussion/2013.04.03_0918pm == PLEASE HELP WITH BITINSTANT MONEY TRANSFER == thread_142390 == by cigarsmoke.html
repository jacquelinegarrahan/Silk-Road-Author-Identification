				Type in your SR address in blockchain.info (I&#039;d recommend doing this in TOR.)&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter if you have an account with them, they track every transaction on their website.&nbsp; When it gets between 6-10 confirmations, it&#039;ll be in your account.

				ok i copy and pasted my SR address onto blockchain.info search, and all it showed me was&quot; No transactions found for this address, it has probably not been used on the network yet.&quot;<br />thanks for your time and trying to help me but is there anything else that i can do?

				Did you get an email confirming your payment? I usually get one the second I finish filling out the moneygram. <br /><br />If so have you tried contacting their support with your order ID? <br /><br />They got back to me right away when I messaged them about an unrelated issue today. Hope you get everything worked out man

				If it&#039;s not even showing up on blockchain at all, then that means Bitinstant hasn&#039;t sent any bitcoins.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need to get in touch with Bitinstant.

				There is currently an issues with bitcoin processing and SR DPR has been posting updates here: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142356.0<br />I know this isn&#039;t really related but can anyone think of a reason that after I attempted a withdrawal from SR&nbsp; today to one of my other accounts and after I did so a transaction showed up in the block chain from that account dated the 22nd of March sending the same amount I withdrew to two accounts I have never heard of.

				What I am trying to say it that it may not be an issue with Bitinstant, but just that he is trying to put it in his SR account and SR is very behind processing these things at the moment. The problem has been going on since the 1st of the month and the original post was made on the 3rd so cigarsmoke may just have to wait another day or two until SR gets back on track.<br />In my case I realize the split may be normal but is it normal for it to be post-dated by over a week?

				I apologize for the multiple comments but I am still trying to figure out exactly how&nbsp; what you mean since how could you tell if they ever sent the coins since they were routed through other accounts and are unable to be deposited in the SR wallet where the OP listed as the destination.

				what kind of information would be needed for bitinstant to look into things? cause i cant log onto my tormail account to give them my order number. the only information that i can give them would be a reference number that money gram gave me. which by the way i called and they had confirmed that my money was transfered to zipzap. and the other information that i have is my silk road address. also a fake name and home address for anonymity.

				the amount was $383.95 total which i sent on tuesday at 5:14pm eastern time and still havent received. and prior to that transaction i had sent $313.95&nbsp; the day before on monday night at 10:30pm eastern time which i received a couple hours later on my silk road account. <br />so my best bet would be to wait untill tormail works out there kinks so i can log on and give bitinstant the order number and proper information that they emailed me on my tormail account?<br /><br /><br />

				ok, i finally just logged on my tormail account and i received a email from bitinstant on tue couple hours after my cash deposit. and they said the money was transfered to an mt gox account. so the only conclusion that i have is that i may have mistakenly choose mt gox for a direct cash deposit and entered my SR address. so instead of choosing a bitcoin address to send the cash deposit, i clicked mt gox and put my SR address. UGH. i emailed bitinstant gave them my order number and SR address and said that the funds were to be sent to a bitcoin address not a mt gox address. <br /><br />so what have i got my self into?
