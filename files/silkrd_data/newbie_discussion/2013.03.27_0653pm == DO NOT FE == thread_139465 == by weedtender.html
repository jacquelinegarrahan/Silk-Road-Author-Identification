				Let me give you guys some advice. If you look hard enough you will find a vendor that will allow you not to FE. but most of the time you will have to because your new. so here is the trick. Start with a small transaction. If you have to FE do so. If you dont receive the goods. politely ask for a reship but do not push for a refund. dont take a refund it doesnt look good that your new and you already recived a refund. it looks bad to other vendors. its best to just count it as a lost. dont leave a bad review just take it as a lost and try another vendor. that way your history stays with 0 percent refund rate. that way you have a better chance next time around that another vendor will give you a chance and not require you to FE. consider it as an investment. its worth it casue once you have a good standing it will be easier for you to be trusted. it better to lose some money in the begging and have a chance later than to keep your money from a couple of refunds and look bad to other vendors. thats my strategy

				when you make a purchase it goes in escrow and most of the time you dont have to release the funds (finalize) until you recieve the product. but since scamming is common play here on the road alot of vendor will make you release the funds before you receive the product&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( FINALIZE EARLY) its at your digression but if you do then the SR admin cant help you get a refund or reship

				I have been scammed on 5 orders straight now.&nbsp; It is all about whether you are FORCED to FE because of needing to go to shady dealers because what you want is rare or hard to ship to where you live.&nbsp; It is extremely frustrating, and the other thing of course is sellers who set themselves up as trustworthy and then scam out all at once, raking in big bucks.&nbsp; All part of the game.

				There is a problem with the definition of FE. <br /><br />For some vendors, when they say FE, they mean:<br /><br />1. Finalize before the purchased items have been shipped<br />2. Finalize before you have received the items<br /><br />In these cases I&#039;ve found that they either don&#039;t trust newbies, or they need the funds in hand to get the items promised. I can understand not trusting us, but not having the goods on hand? You shouldn&#039;t be listing it if you don&#039;t have it to sell.<br /><br />Then there are those who mean:<br /><br />1. Finalize before the 17 day auto finalize<br />2. Finalize as soon as you receive your items (before the auto finalize)<br /><br />So there needs to be a standard definition. I have no problem with the second two. It&#039;s just common courtesy to pay up as soon as you have your goods in hand. There&#039;s no reason to be lazy and wait for the system to do it for you.<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to hear what some veteran purchasers and vendors have to say?

				Yup.<br /><br />I can see why dealers are wary.&nbsp; Instead of FE what about a compromise .. 1/2 now .. 1/2 on delivery.&nbsp; ?&nbsp; At least, it&#039;s a leap of faith on both sides now.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to get intouch wtih loyalist - but no joy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got just afew questions as interested in some of that hash oil of his.<br /><br />Funny enough, so far, getting weed on the street easier than on-line !!<br />

				Stinkybuns get it together man. If they force you to FE, just decline and cancel the order. Scammed 5 times in a row and it sounds like you still haven&#039;t learned your lesson.

That cannot be stressed enough.&nbsp; You have protection from being scammed if you do!! The only good reason a vendor should ask anyone to FE is if the buyer&#039;s stats are poor.&nbsp; And if that is the case, it&#039;s the buyer&#039;s fault.&nbsp; Take care of your stats and stay in escrow!! That&#039;s the best protection you have.&nbsp; Anything to the contrary is highly questionable.&nbsp;

				There are legitimate reasons for FE, but just not because the seller demands it. Overseas orders are another case and the vendor should have a re-ship policy of some kind. I have FEd before for very trusted vendors and I only got burned once when Toyotman went rogue. He was here way longer than I was at the time so I thought he could be trusted. But I agree, don&#039;t FE just because a domestic vendor demands it. Find a vendor like me who will take orders from noobs as long as they acknowledge they understand the finalization process and wait no more than 24 hours after receipt to finalize. Preferably that same day as delivery. I always do.

				I go with &#039;compromise&#039;, half now and the rest on delivery. However, there needs to be an infrastructure change here in SR to accommodate that.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing to do (from the vendor side) is to provide an incentive for the customers to FE, like give a small gift in the package. But the last word should be spelled out by the buyer in any case.

				Now we are getting somewhere with this dialogue. it wuld be easier to start a web of trust that will allow both buyers and sellers to join in hopes of a comprise. that would not be mandatory but it would reveal who would be willing to work with new buyers.

				ok.......&nbsp; There is no way I would ever trust anything on this site ever again if new &quot;non-escrow&quot; options became available.&nbsp; There is so much evidence on here that if you FE for any reason, there is a much higher risk that you WILL be scammed.&nbsp; Just look at the huge amount of new buyers and sellers on here in just the past few months.&nbsp; The escrow system is effective.&nbsp; It is there to protect everyone.&nbsp; Buyers and sellers alike.<br /><br />As far as international order, I agree there is a much higher risk to the seller that the package will not reach the destination.&nbsp; But if you have seen what has been going on in AU lately and many other places around the world you have seen that customs services everywhere have been cracking down in record numbers.&nbsp; Also, most of the respectable domestic US vendors won&#039;t even ship internationally anymore.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t blame them. <br /><br />I highly suggest to everyone, and it is in your best interest, to never do business on here internationally.&nbsp; It will only put you AND your vendor in jeopardy.&nbsp; And will put more heat on SR as well.&nbsp; That is pretty good advice.&nbsp;

				Overseas packages are just asking for trouble, I think.<br /><br />Certainly, purchasing via SR has it&#039;s merits !&nbsp; But I guess, for sure, it&#039;s the same story of building a rapport with a vendor .. just like in real life.<br />Hmm ... what do the Vendors think ?&nbsp; Be good to get their thoughts as I&#039;m sure they&#039;ve been scammed before as well..<br /><br />Hopefully Loyalist will see this thread !
