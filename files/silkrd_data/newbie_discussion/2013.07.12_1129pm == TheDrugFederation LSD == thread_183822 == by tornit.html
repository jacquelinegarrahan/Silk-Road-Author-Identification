				I recently ordered from TheDrugFederation, he communicated well and helped me out with shipping. I got a few tabs of &#039;cid and this was my first purchase. I am going to try the product tomorrow but i havent gotten to see it yet let alone try it and I have seen almost all good feedback for the guy but recently I saw a review saying that he was selling research chemicals and this kinda makes me nervous... Anyone have any experience with him or have any more info. Im thinking that that reviewer was bullshitting but you cant be careful enough.&nbsp; ;)

Insane mental head high, no body load at all. A little stronger as well.<br /><br />I can see who left the fake feedback comment, there name is : brightlights90&nbsp; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They are a bullshitter and negative karma will find its way to them! <br /><br />Peace and Love,<br /><br />~TDF~

				We only took one tab each as we all had never tried it before. My trip was not very visual but very euphoric and gigly. It felt like I had a wider range of view - like I could see across the whole apartment. My friend was staring at a painting for over twenty minutes saying that everytime he breathed it changed colors from red to white. At one point I was sitting on the floor looking at the carpet and it seemed like the individual strands of carpet were moving slightly in a wavy pattern. Lights were very bright. We tried writing on a notepad but our writing was terrible and it didnt make much sense. One of the girls that was tripping kept talking about leaving and coming back to reality. We tried to play N64 mario kart and it took us over an hour just to set up the game to play. The trip seemed to move in distinct stages. When we were writing on the note pad we were able to write down some phrases that we said or thought that seemed very important at the time:<br />&quot;Play reality man&quot;<br />&quot;Why does it feel like water losts of water&quot;<br />&quot;NO PHONES&quot;<br />&quot;No swimming we,&quot;<br />&quot;This IS Drugs&quot;<br />&quot;stay inside&quot;<br />&quot;loops&quot;<br />&quot;Im in reality, im here in and this is goodality&quot;<br />&quot;WHY. NOT. OH. GOD&quot;<br />Its also important to note that the five of us smoked almost four grams of pot as well.<br />&nbsp;

My brain works better on this xtal :) not worse. Over time you will learn to control your trip and you can do pretty much anything you can do on a normal day :)<br /><br />Thanks for the support guys :)<br /><br />peace and love,<br /><br />~TDF~
