				Guys,<br />Whats it take for a vendor to be taken down. Yes I finalized early so lessons learned. It was a small amount&nbsp; ($70) so I might be one of the luckier ones. I WAS smart enough to at least check his feedback and at the time it was squeaky clean unfortunately if you go back from current to 14 days it has become horrendous with multiple people claiming NO PRODUCT and NO COMMUNICATION. I messaged him 4 times after FE and he never responded t a single message 11 days later and no product I have come to the conclusion that I have been scammed. People are killing him on feedback accusing him of issuing bogus tracking numbers ZERO communication after FE, and outright lying to his customers even threatening one. SO what is SR&#039;s position when it comes to this unethical treatment of customers. <br /><br />SamGiancana93 is a lying scamming piece of shit vendor and should be shut down !!!!!!!!!

				&nbsp;Im sorry to hear that you were scammed.&nbsp; Unfortunatly the only thing you can do now is update your feedback so others can see ScamG is a scammer.&nbsp; The mod libertas has clearly written up how to change feedback.<br /><br />To update any feedback that you have left simply click Account, View feedback (in the box on the right) and the &#039;edit&#039; button beside whichever feedback you wish to update.<br /><br />The more people that give him 1/5 for scamming, the lower his rating goes.&nbsp; Hopefully it will drop enough to set off red flags for other unsuspecting buyers and also for SR staff and they can shut his account down.<br /><br />You should also use the &quot;report this vendor&quot; button on his vendor page as well.&nbsp; Im sure Sam is taking advantage of the busy SR staff working to stop the DoS attack, but he will most likely be banned very soon.

				thanks for the replies and don&#039;t get me wrong ...... I&#039;m not crying over spilt milk ....... I tilted the glass by doing an FE. I have done all of the above including reporting the vendor and killing him on feedback. I&#039;m just kind of surprised that someone can&#039;t just freeze his account and say enough is enough.

				No problem michael58, The admins are usually very quick with dealing with scammers.&nbsp; Im 99% sure the reason it is taking so long is that scamG is using the recent outages to his advantage.&nbsp; <br /><br />DPR and crew investigates every vendor thoroughly before taking away their account. I&#039;m sure DPR and crew are working very hard to keep the site up at the moment and work out the bugs.&nbsp; SamG knows this and is using it to his advantage and that is why its taking a bit longer than normal to revoke his vending privileges

				As one of what I&#039;m sure is many customers who SG has scammed, I&#039;d like to add a few things to the discussion.<br /><br />Much like michael58 and a few others have mentioned, I didn&#039;t start posting about SG in an attempt to hold someone else responsible for the loss of coin. We all seem to fully understand that we assumed a large amount of risk by FEing. I&#039;m certainly not looking for anyone&#039;s sympathy and accept that what I did was foolish and the situation was easily avoidable.<br /><br />If I can, I&#039;d like to explain some of the particulars regarding my case. I was not lured into FEing by an offer of bonus. In fact, the order which ended up costing me so much trouble was placed well before SG announced his &quot;sale&quot;. Having had previous exemplary service from SG, I had been for a month or so negotiating a bulk deal with him. The one issue that had been preventing the deal had been my concern with an international order of that size and the possible involvement of customs officials. My agreement to a deal was reached after being informed of domestic availability of the product and volume that I was interested in.<br /><br />I agreed to SG&#039;s request to FE because due to the recent BTC crash his cash flow was quite restricted and I knew that an order of my size would definitely cripple him till the transaction completed. Based on my past experience with him, and the almost uniformly great reviews (at that time) from his vendors page, and an understanding of the predicament he was likely in, I let my soft side do the decision making and did something I now regret.<br /><br />The point in posting my situation in these forums was to hopefully alert any unsuspecting customers, not to garner sympathy and try to hold someone else responsible for my loss. I was also hoping that my posts, along with the negative vendor review and the reporting of the situation and vendor to SR admin, would prompt admin to at least look at the vendor and possibly freeze his accounts until the situation had been looked at. <br /><br />I reported the vendor several days ago and will keep all communications and relevant information handy should SR administration see fit to investigate this goof. I just wish they would have done so as the reports started coming in and possibly saved many customers the grief and loss inflicted by SG.
