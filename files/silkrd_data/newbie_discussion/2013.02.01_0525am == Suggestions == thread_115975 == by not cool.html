				Connection speed is pathetic. Im tired of poor performance or not being able to connect at all. Stop being cheap and upgrade your servers.<br />$500 for a sellers account if just plain greedy.&nbsp; Buyers scam more than sellers. All they gotta do is make another free account. $200 for sellers account. $100 for buyers account.

				Visiting .onion sites is slow to begin with. Suck it up. And $100 for a buyer&#039;s account? Seriously? What are you smoking, and can I get it on SR?

				Do you not realize that to be secure and anonymous you need to run through the TOR network. If you look into what TOR does you will then realize why the site runs slow. It is nothing to do with the servers.<br /><br />I know what you can do...... eBay is nice and fast, how about you sell some drugs on their and see how long you last...... you wouldn&#039;t last at all!! The necessity&#039;s of such a site unfortunately make for slow loading times but avoids you getting put into a nice little cell with a room mate!!<br /><br />I will take the slow speed any day as i know the benefits of anonymity.<br /><br />And to charge for a buyers account is just ridiculous and would destroy the site as the buyers would just leave and go back to the street! <br /><br />

Biggest laugh all day!&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D<br /><br />Wann speed up TOR/onion sites? Set up a high-bandwidth TOR relay and lobby all your friends to too - that&#039;s the biggest issue. Plus, all that encryption and routing takes time. You can super-fast, or you can have super-safe, but I don&#039;t see how you can have them both. As someone said, go try eBay....

				I agree with the other post that Sr won&#039;t last if buyers must pay $100. It&#039;s expensive enuff paying for security,shipping and annomity.

				I think charging $500 for a vendor account is a great idea! Weeds out (almost) all the scammers and promotes vendors who are in this for the long haul :)<br /><br />Also, apparently the $500 is a deposit that you get back after you have $1,500 in sales? I didn&#039;t know this, but I read it somewhere on the forums.<br /><br />&lt;3 Rose &lt;3

I wouldn&#039;t get too excited about getting the $500 back. I do nearly that much volume daily, and I&#039;ve been here directly for 6 months. Haven&#039;t seen my vendor fee refunded.
