				I&#039;ve tried most of the other domestic #4 vendors, and just tried subs for the first time this week.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s that good.&nbsp;

				Subs is definitely strong and everyone seems to like it, but I just don&#039;t get much euphoria from it, or for that matter, from any of the highly recommended sources on SR.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t understand it.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t tried Subs yet; I usually go to deluxedelivery who is absolutely superb. I just recently ordered from Maestro though and am pretty dissatisfied. Has anyone else received from him?

				Hi srcamelfeeder,&nbsp; Well, your post is encouraging.&nbsp; So some of the dope on here does give you euphoria and all the good feelings I used to get from heroin.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried a batch from subs, a batch from MisterMcFeely and a batch from gotsitall and, while all were potent, none gave me the euphoria and and pleasure of the heroin I used to do years ago.&nbsp; I have a sample of Nod&#039;s dope coming early next week (from Nods4less).&nbsp; I hope that will be satisfying.&nbsp; What batch from Nod did you like?&nbsp; Can you figure out why I haven&#039;t had pleasurable H even with these three highly rated vendors?&nbsp; I gave some to a friend of mine last night and he had the same reaction as me, so I know it isn&#039;t just me.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure this out and in the meantime it is getting very expensive to search for satisfying dope!

				Just tried subs. Will update and let you know. I&#039;ve seen mixed reviews on both DTs. Can anyone confirm whether these are good? I&#039;ve heard to stay away from the top 3 stamps listings, but the reviews on SR seem fine.

				I was wondering if I should take advantage of the 15 stamp Deezletime offer or get the 500mg Subs offering. Everybody raves about Subs, but Deezletime has some good stamps. One stamp usually has me going. I have been buying tar recently, but want powder and it seems like Subs has the best stuff on the road.
