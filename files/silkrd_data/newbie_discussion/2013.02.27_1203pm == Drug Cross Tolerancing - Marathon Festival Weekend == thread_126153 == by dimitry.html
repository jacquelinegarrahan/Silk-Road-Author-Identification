				For those of you who go to long Music Festivals, such as Rainbow Serpent of Maitreya in Australia, what drugs do you take and in what order to maximize your long weekend. Both of these Festivals go from Friday 5pm Until Monday 5 pm. I am heading to Maitreya Festival in just over a week, and plan to take the following, but am not 100 percent on the order to take them to maximize effect.<br /><br />1. MDMA<br />2. Pot<br />3. LSD Tabs<br />4. Two points of Cocaine<br />5. Hash<br />6. Mushrooms.<br />7. DMT<br />8. Changa <br /><br />Pot and LSD and MDMA tend to go well together, but MDMA and LSD are usually really good on the first day, then not as effective on the second. I think LSD and MDMA both affect serotonin, so taking MDMA on it&#039;s own the day after taking LSD on it&#039;s own probably means the second day will not be as good (and vice versa). I am not sure whether mushrooms affect serotonin, but i think they go well with all of the above, except possibly cocaine (which will cancel the shroom trip for the duration of the coke trip).<br /><br />Cocaine, in my experience cancels any other drug in your system, so i will probably take it on it&#039;s own, either on the first night or last day, but not with anything else.<br /><br />Pot/Hash tend to go well on any day, and i find are just as effective no matter how many days i have smoked it.<br /><br />Anyway, enough from me, what are your thoughts.

				LSD can have a long duration and it does go good with a little MDMA, but both have quick tolerance build up. If I were you I&#039;d go with a phenethylamine like DOI or DOB. At high doses (3 mg+) you can be tripping for over 24 hours. But its not an overwhelming high like LSD can be like. Its a very lucid and energetic high that I find perfect for long concerts.

				Acid has quick tolerance and is cross tolerant with psilocybin containing mushrooms. hash is a waste of money. <br />this is how i would go:<br />Friday--&gt;Saturday: Weed and alcohol (Weed first if you don&#039;t want to end as a zombie)<br />Saturday--&gt;Sunday: Full fire: 1. Acid, after you have finished the blotters (and/or mushrooms if you like the psilocy/LSD combination) take some MDMA crystals/ pills and then smoke a already rolled joint. The joint will make the MDMA and Acid kick in strong and fast. Repeat this if you feel the need to. <br />Sunday--&gt;Monday: Now it&#039;s time to come down. Could continue with MDMA but you might already have a tolerance (Depends on you and the doses you take). If so, get some alcohol, drink, enjoy being drunk and then when you start getting sober drink some more and then go with coke for&nbsp; a few hours. If that is too expensive for you I&#039;d recommend speed/amphetamine/methamphetamine. A few hours before the end, you might start to relax some more. MXE, keta, dope, beer or whatever you like.<br /><br />DMT isn&#039;t worth it on festivals imo because of the short duration and the strong effects. DOB isn&#039;t a bad idea but some people have problems with tripping for that long times.

I am going to try and do friday night on Weed only, as i don&#039;t drink much any more, had assumed that i would take the MDMA and psychedelics together, but i can see the merits of taking MDMA towards the end of the Psychedelics. Reckon i will try and get some DOI and have that instead of the LSD.<br /><br />Cheers again.<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya<br />

I have a fair bit. Would that work well in place of DOI/DOB. <br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />Dimitry from Straya

				you can combine DOM and MDMA but be warned: The trip is gonna be strong. And I actually meant that you take the MDMA straight after the LSD (so no break in between) but it is also possible to wait till the acid peak is over. That gives some nice results as well.
