				I would assume that cyanide is in the banned substances list - too easy to be used for unsavory purposes. <br /><br />Go buy some heroin or benzos. Easy enough to kill yourself with those.

				dude please do NOT use potassium cyanide.. it is NOT quick and its a fucking horrible death.&nbsp; as someone who has made many suicide attempts and maintains an active suicide plan, as well as known many friends and family members who have accomplished it, truly the only good answers i&#039;ve seen in here are<br /><br />1. phenobarbitol<br />2. gunshot to the roof of the mouth<br /><br />in the case of PB, it is quick and painless, it is extremely effective, and its something that you could carry out with your loved ones close to you if you would prefer to leave in that way<br /><br />a gunshot to the roof of the mouth will kill you before you even hear it.&nbsp; its extremely effective, but in some places its fairly difficult to get a gun, understandably.&nbsp; if you live in the us you can do cash n carry at any gun show though and not have to worry about background checks/waiting periods.<br /><br />pills and other drugs are unreliable and you can be revived in the ER.&nbsp; i overdosed on temazepam at one point to the extreme, thought that there was no way i could survive it.&nbsp; flatlined and was brought back in the ambulance.&nbsp; <br /><br />i dont recommend suicide of course but i know that sometimes the pain we feel is too much for anyone to handle.&nbsp; <br />if i wasnt taking a row of psych drugs a couple times a day and medicating heavily w/ hash oil i dont think i could cope.<br /><br />anyways yeah i can think of plenty of things that will probably kill you, but if you&#039;re serious then IV phenobarbitol and guns are what you should be looking into

				Someone mentioned benzos and alcohol, that will not work at all.<br />Benzos are quite safe and not toxic, (letah dose) LD levels so high.<br />But alcohol and barbiturates would work. But that combo is dumb.<br />Just take lethal does of an opiate, buy some heroin and make a capsule.<br />You will fee no pain.

				10 grams or more of an orally-administered barbiturate like pentobarbital (Nembutal) or Seconal is likely to kill anyone who hasn&#039;t already built up a high tolerance to barbiturates.<br /><br />That said, studies in Oregon, which is a right-to-die state, indicate something like a 25% failure rate in the application of prescription euthanasia, even by trained physicians. The body can be remarkably resilient.<br /><br />There is probably no &#039;poison pill&#039; that you can easily obtain that would not involve massive suffering on your way to death. Your best bet would be to combine an overdose of a barbiturate with alcohol and an opiate. And be prepared to find yourself not dead, but in a hospital.<br /><br />As a side note, do NOT try overdosing on Tylenol. You probably won&#039;t die, but you will linger on for a time with catastrophic organ failure. Not a fun way to go out.<br /><br />I am not a physician and I found this information out by Googling.

				What a dark little thread.....<br /><br />Here are my thoughts (I am a doctor...who likes recreational drugs!!)<br /><br />The pentobarbital/pheobarbital approach is probably the best as there is the least chance of vomiting or seizure before death, usually when these drugs are used to end life (as in Switzerland for example) an anti-emetic is given about 30 mins before taking the barb just in case, proclorperazine (Buccastem) is pretty good at preventing non motion nausea and is available over the counter.<br /><br />A huge dose of opiate such as heroin or morphine will also work but as many people vomit with opiates this may be more troublesome as you may not have absorbed a lethal dose before vomiting and may be revived with naloxone or similar.&nbsp; Less of an issue if you inject but as the thread was for a suicide &quot;pill&quot; then maybe the needle is not for you?<br /><br />Just to repeat the advice of others here, dont use paracetamol/tylenol (slow, painful with organ failure), Cyanide (not as quick as the movies make out, agonising and there is an antidote), benzos (unreliable even with huge amounts of alcohol) also I wouldn&#039;t overdose on cocaine (seizure/heart attack quite possible) or most other recreational drugs (MDMA, 2CB etc.) for similar reasons.<br /><br />Ketamine would also be a poor choice as it is not very toxic and a near lethal k-hole would not be very nice to wake up from in the hospital in my opinion!<br /><br />I hope you have a long and happy life my friend..for the record I have 15g of pentobarbital (liquid) on standby in a quiet corner as my way out if things turn bad, it has a long, long shelf life though&nbsp; :) <br /><br />peace<br /><br />x<br />

				Think about where you are going when you die...this life is temporary, but the next life is forever, or rather, eternal, whether eternal life, or eternal deateh.<br /><br />So I hope your heading to a better place, a place of eternal life, aka heaven.<br /><br />But on another note, If I were you, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d want to stand before God and Him say &quot;Gee, your here a bit early...&quot;<br />ya know what Im saying?&nbsp; I mean He gots everything planned and therefore Hes in control, so to take your life before it was your time to go, whether your going to heaven or hell, you basically gotta explain why you ended things before it was actually your time for things to be ended here....but Im sure you can think of some explanation...but Id wish rather you call on Jesus cuz Jesus is how I got over all my emotional problems, and tell u what, only reason Id wana take my life is to avoid some crazy type of torture, but Ill tell u what else, if I died right now I know I&#039;m going to heaven, and not cuz what Ive done Im the most rotten dude on the planet, but cuz what Jesus did for me, thats why I&#039;m going to heaven.

				I feel like the OP ran away.<br /><br />While I&#039;m pretty certain that the documents are rather difficult to find in the US due to their nature, there have been a good number of doctors that are extreme proponents of allowing people to choose their day, especially in regards to those that are suffering. Kavorkian did quite a bit of research into it, and while he was ostracized, I feel he did many good things for the freedom of people to make that choice. With modern information regarding pain (although it is still incomplete, it is deplorable the level of refusal on acceptance of being in actual pain) and the effects of various chemicals on it... it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to come up with the right way to do it.<br /><br />I would honestly recommend against poisoning - there are not many poisons on the planet that don&#039;t go badly. Some have a chance for survival too, with extremely dire consequences. Cyanide for example... it is particularly dangerous, but the commonly referenced &quot;suicide pill&quot; that gained popularity amongst spy themes has been repeatedly noted for its lack of well defined success. It will very easily leave you with a VERY bad scar... probably lose some teeth, amongst other damages to your internals.<br /><br />That being said I honestly wouldn&#039;t consider it such a great thing to plan as a destiny. At the very least, if you have any desire to leave insurance or anything of the like to your progeny, you may want to read the fine print. Outside of that, I don&#039;t know - I&#039;m just not a fan of giving up.

				I&#039;ve been suicidal since I was only 12 years old and am now between 25-30 years old. So I can say that I have thought and researched it quite intensively. And although suicidal people don&#039;t really think about anyone else anymore, I really advise those contemplating it NOT to do it by jumping under a train. There are so many consequences for other people... Some (or maybe all, i don&#039;t know) countries charge the families for the costs of cleaning, delay of trains and whatnot. This can result in serious financial setbacks for your family who are already devastated because their son/daughter/wife/husband ... just killed himself. I can assure you suicide really ruins families. So if you&#039;re still capable of acting rationally, don&#039;t do it like this and try to die in a peaceful way. Killing yourself by sticking a gun in your mouth is mostly pain free, but of course isn&#039;t really nice to watch. But this is certainly a good option when you&#039;re living in the US. <br /><br />In normal countries where people nor babies are allowed to buy guys, some form of overdose is recommendable. Overdose by benzos is dumb and will seldom work. If you only have benzos at hand, make sure you drink a lot of alcohol with it; and even then there&#039;s a decent chance you will survive it. What will work is drinking alcohol, taking some fast acting benzo and put a plastic bag over your head and make sure that no air can escape by taping it or something alike. You do have to experiment with it first, to see how fast you will pass out from the benzos so you put the bag over your head at the right time. You&#039;ll first fall asleep (use a lot benzos) and then you&#039;ll suffocate in ur sleep.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier however, phenobarbitol is when of the best choices. Euthanasia is also performed with some barbiturate (but also couple other things): nevertheless an overdose of this ( and alcohol is always a plus )<br /><br />even though I just found a phenobarbitol source, I already made my choice a while back ago: methadone. I never used any opiates so it&#039;s really easy to die from(Opiates and/or barbiturates are the way to go ). I have less than 6 months less on this earth, so i&#039;m just trying to enjoy the fuck out of it.<br /><br />While I&#039;m suggesting couple of things, which prolly already been said in this thread; i&#039;m not promoting people to commit suicide.<br />there&#039;s this saying: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know life can skullfuck you with a big fat black cock and suicide looks the only way out. But in a lot of cases, things will get better; They really will. <br />There&#039;s lots of things that can make you desperate as fuck and sometimes it seems that it really won&#039;t get any better, but again, most of the time it will.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there are people that will never get better; that are living a miserable life and have no prospect at all. It&#039;s hard to determine where to draw the line; People with permanent mental illnesses that completely ruin their life, take control of their body and or minds have imo the right to end their life. I&#039;ve heard stories before bout people telling me that their boyfriend broke up with him or husband left or even died and that they&#039;ve gone through months of suffering and then they tell me that it will get better. Some people can&#039;t handle such situations and they really break down. And I also know this because I&#039;m also one of those that can&#039;t handle these things and those weeks or months were really crazy; I really broke down. But it got better.<br /><br />Although you break down all the time and are non stop in pain and maybe want to die; it does get better. But grief and being heartbroken etc.. does not make you clinically depressed; honestly that&#039;s a whole different level; I&#039;ve got a mental illness and it will never go away and no medication works. At first I lost my friends, then my GF, then ... , then my future. etc..;&nbsp; You have the right to end your life if there&#039;s really no way out. The fact that I&#039;m still alive today is because i never could go through with it because of my parents; but after your umpteenth depression that reason starts to fade.&nbsp; And again, if u never been really depressed you can&#039;t really say anything about it, because you have no fucking idea what u go through. it&#039;s not something u just &#039; get over &#039;.<br /><br />The end&nbsp; :-X

				This may have already been mentioned (I&#039;ve not read the whole thread) but the method Dignitas use is a pentobarbital overdose preceded by a powerful antiemetic. The later would be pretty easy to come by and you can find pentobarbital in the barbiturates aisle of your favourite internet drug emporium. Death would be from respiratory arrest after entering a coma. Since they use this method for euthanasia, I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s relatively pain free.<br /><br />Edit: a quick search reveals that they use 15g (bloody hell) of pentobarbital dissolved in 100ml of water or orange juice and that the antiemetic is metoclopramide.

				You want Cyanide? Hey NP go down to your local Home Depot or Walmart and get yourself some rat poison. If they don&#039;t have that any commerical bug killer will have cyanide in it however it really does help if it&#039;s powder form so that you can easily make pills out of it. <br /><br />Another little FUN FACT for you is that cyanide has no taste or odor. Only people that would have access to that kind of cyanide would typically be chemists.&nbsp; Dying from cyanide poisoning is one the worst ways to go so not sure if that would be a good pill for suicide. Basically what happens after a large ingestion of cyanide is it will start to eat away at your internal organs dissolving them slowly over time while you sit there half alive and half dead until finally your body shuts down but not after you&#039;ve felt the worst pain in your life.

				Pentobarbital is what they use for lethal injections in Texas. I know you said pill but one vial of pento and you pass out, your body goes into hyperkalemia and poof you&#039;re dead. I&#039;d honestly just buy a gun instead of messing around with pills if you want to kill yourself, because there&#039;s no way to know what you&#039;re getting until you actually try the pill. <br />To me it sounds like you just want someone dead but oh well.

				A day may come when I am old when I might elect to check out. Alzheimer&#039;s runs in my family and I will NOT go that route. If I didn&#039;t have any loved ones left I might just use a shotgun. Quick and painless. But pretty traumatic for anyone who might find me.<br /><br />I would probably settle on a &quot;exit bag&quot;. Put a bag over my head and flood with with an inert gas like nitrogen. The inert gas prevents that suffocating feeling. A couple deep breaths and you will be unconscious. My one fear about that is, while your brain is dieing, would you possibly experience something that could be akin to a bad trip? Is it possible, just as on psychedelics you experience moments of eternity? Not sure if I want my last moments to be like a bad trip. There would be no such risk with a shotgun.&nbsp;

So I can say that I have thought and researched it quite intensively. And although suicidal people don&#039;t really think about anyone else anymore, I really advise those contemplating it NOT to do it by jumping under a train. There are so many consequences for other people... Some (or maybe all, i don&#039;t know) countries charge the families for the costs of cleaning, delay of trains and whatnot. This can result in serious financial setbacks for your family who are already devastated because their son/daughter/wife/husband ... just killed himself. I can assure you suicide really ruins families. So if you&#039;re still capable of acting rationally, don&#039;t do it like this and try to die in a peaceful way. Killing yourself by sticking a gun in your mouth is mostly pain free, but of course isn&#039;t really nice to watch. But this is certainly a good option when you&#039;re living in the US. <br /><br />In normal countries where people nor babies are allowed to buy guys, some form of overdose is recommendable. Overdose by benzos is dumb and will seldom work. If you only have benzos at hand, make sure you drink a lot of alcohol with it; and even then there&#039;s a decent chance you will survive it. What will work is drinking alcohol, taking some fast acting benzo and put a plastic bag over your head and make sure that no air can escape by taping it or something alike. You do have to experiment with it first, to see how fast you will pass out from the benzos so you put the bag over your head at the right time. You&#039;ll first fall asleep (use a lot benzos) and then you&#039;ll suffocate in ur sleep.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier however, phenobarbitol is when of the best choices. Euthanasia is also performed with some barbiturate (but also couple other things): nevertheless an overdose of this ( and alcohol is always a plus )<br /><br />even though I just found a phenobarbitol source, I already made my choice a while back ago: methadone. I never used any opiates so it&#039;s really easy to die from(Opiates and/or barbiturates are the way to go ). I have less than 6 months less on this earth, so i&#039;m just trying to enjoy the fuck out of it.<br /><br />While I&#039;m suggesting couple of things, which prolly already been said in this thread; i&#039;m not promoting people to commit suicide.<br />there&#039;s this saying: <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know life can skullfuck you with a big fat black cock and suicide looks the only way out. But in a lot of cases, things will get better; They really will. <br />There&#039;s lots of things that can make you desperate as fuck and sometimes it seems that it really won&#039;t get any better, but again, most of the time it will.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there are people that will never get better; that are living a miserable life and have no prospect at all. It&#039;s hard to determine where to draw the line; People with permanent mental illnesses that completely ruin their life, take control of their body and or minds have imo the right to end their life. I&#039;ve heard stories before bout people telling me that their boyfriend broke up with him or husband left or even died and that they&#039;ve gone through months of suffering and then they tell me that it will get better. Some people can&#039;t handle such situations and they really break down. And I also know this because I&#039;m also one of those that can&#039;t handle these things and those weeks or months were really crazy; I really broke down. But it got better.<br /><br />Although you break down all the time and are non stop in pain and maybe want to die; it does get better. But grief and being heartbroken etc.. does not make you clinically depressed; honestly that&#039;s a whole different level; I&#039;ve got a mental illness and it will never go away and no medication works. At first I lost my friends, then my GF, then ... , then my future. etc..;&nbsp; You have the right to end your life if there&#039;s really no way out. The fact that I&#039;m still alive today is because i never could go through with it because of my parents; but after your umpteenth depression that reason starts to fade.&nbsp; And again, if u never been really depressed you can&#039;t really say anything about it, because you have no fucking idea what u go through. it&#039;s not something u just &#039; get over &#039;.<br /><br />The end&nbsp; :-X<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />WTF is wrong with a big fat black cock. Now i am most offended. surely is better than a small white wrinkely one.

				Ok so time comes and you are old, and you want to die..<br />Why just suicide taking a pill? If you are going to end your life why don&#039;t you be more creative.<br /><br />I can suggest some thinks if you like.<br /><br />Jump from an airplane (if you can afford it) without parachute. Or from a very tall building.<br />Take a motocross bike and jump off from a mountain.<br />Or simply take as many psychedelics you can and overdose to the end..<br /><br />Or one of the best ideas is to become a suicide bomber and go explode yourself at the HQ of CIA, IMF or the Greek parliament (do it as a favor for me).<br /><br />I wish you all the best till that point of your life,<br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />
