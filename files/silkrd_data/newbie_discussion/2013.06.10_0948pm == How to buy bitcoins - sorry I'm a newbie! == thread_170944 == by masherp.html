				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Please can someone spare a few minutes to advise me where and how to buy bitcoins for use on Silk Road?&nbsp; I am completely new to this and any info I can find on the net is quite confusing!<br /><br />After reading another post it looks like bitinstant is the way to go, but is not accepting cash payments at the moment.<br /><br />If I do manage to get some bitcoins, how do I get them to my SR account?<br /><br />Many thanks anyone who can help :)

				This is the best way for me. It takes a little time to set up but works good for me :)<br />1. Make a gox account (learn its basic features)<br />2. Use bitinstant to transfer funds to your new gox account<br />&nbsp;-To do this: You&#039;ll have to do a moneygram at a local participating store for the amount of coin you want; <br />&nbsp;* You can only use cash<br />3. Your funds will be deposited into your gox account shortly<br />4. Use your SR coin address to deposit coin into your account<br />There you go&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				First off, don&#039;t apologize.&nbsp; This is newbie discussion.<br /><br />Second, everyone once was new here.&nbsp; I&#039;m new.&nbsp; The vets were new once upon a time.<br /><br />Third, closed mouths don&#039;t get fed.&nbsp; You are in the right place to ask and you know what?, plenty of other people here are thinking the same questions.&nbsp; You are adding to the knowledge-base of the forum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you for your question because it will help others and you will soon be able to help those who will be in your shoes.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;m having trouble purchasing my first bitcoins.<br /><br />I opened up a wallet at http://blockchain.info and now I keep getting an error message when I try and follow through with a cash deposit.<br /><br />I believe that this is a problem that everyone seems to be experiencing for the moment.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				In order of ease and/or processing charges:<br /><br />coinbase.com- the best in my opinion, tie your bank account to coinbase, buy bitcoin, transfer to your SR bitcoin address. I think it takes a few days to tie the coinbase acct to your bank account.<br /><br />bitinstant.com-find what you want to buy. put this amt. in the bitinstant web interface and your SR bitcoin address. print out the generated invoice. take it to a moneygram, cvs, etc.. pay clerk in cash and they call in the order. order generally shows up in your acct. in about 1 hour. see blockchain.info for more on how long it takes.<br /><br />mt gox- pain in the ass in my opinion, but popular/secure. probably the most secure if you think you may store bitcoin in your account for a while. get a yubikey if that is the case. may need to send them a utility bill.

				If all the pros on here would just stop posting shit like stop asking the same question, this question has already been answered.. Well your not helping.&nbsp; We noobs post these questions over and over again because we obviously have searched and have not found anything.&nbsp; If you see this questions answered in sooo many forums, how about posting a link to those forums?&nbsp; If you keep posting the links to the forums with questions, then we noobs wont ask because the answers will be everywhere. <br /><br />I just spent over $60 on fees in order to get bitcoins from a vendor on SR and it fucking kills when your a college student and dont have money.&nbsp; Sorry not all of us have hours to spend on SR and the forum to do research and learn... People do have lives... These forums are used to ask questions and if your part of this then obviously you have questions too and want to learn, so stop hogging all the knowledge and spread that shit on here!! <br /><br />I would love to learn localbitcoins so that money in fees i spent could go to my goods.&nbsp;

				Normally bitinstant is very easy to use. But while it is down, there are really very few ways to buy bitcoins without spending insane amounts on fees or having to wait days to get it. I actually have no options to get my bitcoins while bitinstant is down. Iv been looking for another method all day but came up empty. I tried localbitcoins and there is nobody in my area to trade with, and all the online options have huge fees or take days. I emailed bitinstant and they said within a couple days it should be back up and running so just be patient and wait for the site to be back up again so we can make easy cash deposits.<br /><br />&nbsp;I dont understand the hate, this is the newbie discussion. We should be allowed to ask dumb questions in here without being burned.

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />
