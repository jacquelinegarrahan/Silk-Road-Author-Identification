				Most coke in my area is usually about 60-80 bucks a gram. Unfortunately this stuff usually ranges in quality from bad to worse...<br /><br />For a few months in last year there was someone who had AMAZING coke. Like seriously right of the brick, as pure as pure can get, shiny fish scale chunks of soft, beautiful cocaine. Unfortunately because of the purity and what kind of shit people were used to in my neighborhood, he sold it for $100/g and refused to sell more than that at a time because he didn&#039;t want anyone dying from his blow. This high quality cocaine is seriously unheard of where I&#039;m from.<br /><br />Unfortunately (or actually fortunately, in my opinion) after trying this stuff I decided blow just isn&#039;t for me. When even the best available product doesn&#039;t get you where you want to, you know that it isn&#039;t for you. For stimulant/euphoric effects, I prefer amphetamines and cathinones, like MDMA, M1, and 4-MMC.<br /><br />Midwest USA, btw.

				I don&#039;t think this info is very usefull, especially if you only mention the price (per gram or more), but not the purity. <br />Here you can buy cheap stuff (without any coke in it, but sold as &quot;C&quot;) and then there is expensive stuff (with some C in it). <br />So, most of the time, the quality and the prices are linked. <br />If you want to make it more intersting, you should ask for the price and the purity. <br /><br />

				It must have been in the past millennium that I heard somebody talking about good coke in my region.<br />But reportedly mid-quality (not as bad as UK street gear) is €90-120, HQ €150 if you can get it. Anything below will not contain much coke at all.<br />Not a bad markup for a drug that sells for $1-2 in Colombia.<br />

				Most people around where I live, (UK) tend to do 3 bags (0.35g) for £40/£50, but it is always poor, blocked nose next morning ect.<br /><br />Found a guy who does 0.80g for £40, best stuff I&#039;ve ever had, hope to find better on SR though!

				All you lucky cunts complaining about grams that are under $100 should come to Australia.<br /><br />Here in Brisbane the standard rates are:<br />1G: $300-350<br />3.5G: $1000-1100<br />1OZ: $6500-8000 depending on quality ($6500 generally means cut to shit however. standard is usually $7000-8000)<br /><br />Also, the coke in Australia is fucking shit compared to the overseas stuff, i&#039;ve got a lot of good contacts in my city but nothing comes close to the stuff you get in Europe. I&#039;d estimate most coke in Australia is less than 50% pure, at 50% here most people would consider the coke to be amazing.
