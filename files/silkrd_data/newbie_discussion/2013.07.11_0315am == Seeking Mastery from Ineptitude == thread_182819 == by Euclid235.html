				Hello.<br /><br />I would appreciate the time and energy of those experienced (and inexperienced) in a matter I hold dear; <br /><br />the successful and safe use of SR. Paranoia is one of my greatest flaws, yet I would attribute it to a strength within this environment. <br /><br />My first tasks to master are: the encryption protocol, the BTC market as well as its behavior/acquisition, and red flags involved during trade. <br /><br />However, any more items of research would be much appreciated.

				Oh, you mean mastery OVER ineptitude.&nbsp; I thought you meant, using ineptitude as a tool to achieve mastery.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; It can be done; Blake said, &quot;a fool who persists in his folly soon becomes wise.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think your way is better.<br /><br />With respect to encryption, to get down to specifics, we need to know what platform you&#039;re using, and if you might be interested in trying Linux.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a bunch of places to learn about encryption, but the basic procedure is, people will give you their encryption key.&nbsp; They don&#039;t give anybody their decryption key, and their attitude is, they don&#039;t mind anybody sending them an encrypted message, as long as they are the only ones who can decrypt it.<br /><br />So you will need software to import and keep track of keys for all the people you correspond with, encrypt messages you send out, and decrypt messages you get back.&nbsp; Windows, Linux, Mac all have different products and options. <br /><br />The drill to send an encrypted message:<br />1.&nbsp; Write a note in word processing or text editor, save it as a plain text&nbsp; file.<br />2.&nbsp; Use your encryption software to encrypt that file using the recipient&#039;s key<br />3. Copy and paste the result to either a web page or an email or what have you.<br /><br />Check out Tails linux.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty nifty application, cheap (can&#039;t beat free, I guess) and takes a lot of the headaches out of setting up a pretty durn secure system.&nbsp; Spend a couple hours reading all the stuff on there website, you will learn a lot and it&#039;s clearly written. <br /><br />Tails also deals with the other whole angle on ecryption, namely how to cover your tracks and keep your data secure.&nbsp; That topic gets real complicated real fast.&nbsp; Look up TrueCrypt, their documentation is very illuminating.&nbsp; (You can look at TrueCrypt and Tails as two different options, which isn&#039;t precisely true but it&#039;s a good way to organize your thinking for now.)<br /><br />Also look up how to do secure passwords you can remember, either here or Google. <br /><br />There&#039;s all kinds of cool stuff in the security forum, sometimes you have to search for the tutorials but there are some good ones in there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Paranoid is good.&nbsp; You need to completely separate the Tor world from the default world.&nbsp; You should have a complete Tor identity, with user names and passwords and email accounts you&#039;ve never used before and never accessed without Tor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you have Tor set up, don&#039;t ever use it to access web sites you frequent without it, and don&#039;t ever access this website without it. For example, before you start googling up all that homework I gave you, decide now if you&#039;re going to use Tor or not, and then don&#039;t ever cross those boundaries.&nbsp; <br /><br />Setting up my SR identity has been a great learning experience, in fact SR is a great experience even if you&#039;re just visiting and not buying.&nbsp; Buying contraband is scary and more than a little frustrating; joining the SR community is fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would say you have a good 40 hours of reading and computer work ahead of you before you&#039;re ready to order.&nbsp; Make the most of it, it&#039;s dorktastic stuff.&nbsp;

				Good info.<br /><br />Also make sure things like your usernames and any information you give out (aside from shipping info direct to Vendor) don&#039;t point back to you in any way.<br /><br />There subreddit&#039;s dedicated to bitcoin and SR are super helpful too.<br /><br />Green Inc
