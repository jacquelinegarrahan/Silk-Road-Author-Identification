				Hello Cannabis Users on SR,<br /><br />Anyone else find the price of Cannabis high on SR?&nbsp; I understand that the nature of the delivery/transaction mechanism could warrant a little bit of a premium, but it seems a bit much.<br />I have found a great reference, for weed prices across various locations:<br /><br />http://www.priceofweed.com/prices/Canada.html<br /><br />I for one, am from Canada, and see that (on average) HIGH Quality Weed sells for $222.56/oz.<br />The closest vendor I have seen come to those prices is sellitall99.&nbsp; I hope that other vendors follow in your footsteps on bringing fair weed prices to SR.<br /><br />In my opinion, the one thing that would attract a buyer, who could otherwise just find their own source locally for a fraction of the price, is selection.<br />I&#039;ve seen some great Cannabis Strains marketed on the SR (MiMM has got the best descriptions, and deserves to be #1 seller, on that alone).<br /><br />However, I&#039;d love to see those price come down.<br /><br />I can only seem to post in the Newbie forum, but anyone else who can drive the message in the broader forums, USERS NEED A VOICE TO DEMAND LOWER PRICES!!!!<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try creating a poll, to see what Strains are most popular.<br /><br />sellitall99 (or any other up-and-comer):<br /><br />I encourage you to widen your strain selection, and what better way to choose, than poll the market.<br /><br />To the polls...<br />

				I think the prices are fine. It&#039;s not just the packing that has to be considered but also most vendors here will replace your order if it happens to get seized or lost which is money out of their pocket. I would like to see a street dealer replace a bag that you bought and getting it taken away or lost..Most likely the person would get a &quot; that&#039;s to bad, sorry bro&quot; a smirk and a middle finger for asking to replace.<br /><br />I look at it as an investment into limited insurance (I know vendor will replace order if it gets seized or lost) and sticking with the vendor &quot;investing&quot; the extra dollars will be rewarded in the end. Take care of him and he&#039;ll take care of you.<br /><br />In the end and I mean this in the nicest way possible. If the prices out there are cheaper than what is listed here, you&#039;re in Canada the country is flooded&nbsp; with buds...<br /><br />Vendors gotta eat too.

				Fair enough.&nbsp; I suppose there is always the possibility of negotiating with individual vendors, once trusted relationships have been established.<br />

				Could we at least get the option to sort by price? At the very least it would make the purchasing process easier.

				More often than not you get what you pay for. Understandably the extra effort in packaging and shipping, on top of the volatility in bitcoin keeps prices about 10-20% higher than on the street. I believe most vendors are doing the best they can.

I spent a couple weeks in the North Eastern area of the USA and found an ounce for 300 dollars which I thought was absolutely ridiculous. (The quality was very high, and it smoked great) Where as my friend who lived out there was astonished I found bud that good for that low. Then during that same trip, going all the way back to the Western coast of the USA, I found some, which were either the same, or slightly higher quality for 210 an ounce. Location location man.<br /><br />What I&#039;m trying to say is, if a vendor in say, New York wants to make money in his region, he&#039;s gonna have to sell based on the price of his region. Well, until he establishes himself here first of course.

				Growing GOOD to GREAT cannabis is an art form not all will master......<br /><br />That being said.... it is quite easy to sprout a seed and plant it in some soil.&nbsp; Do yourself a favor and get medical marijuana legalized in your state.... get a medical card and grow some cannabis for yourself....<br /><br />Not only will you have your smoke or edibles for close to free..... you will have the thrill of watching one of mother natures most beautiful plants go from seed to flower in almost no time....<br /><br />Happy Gardening folks<br /><br />mm

				There are indeed highly overpriced stuff, i think it&#039;s due to the high demand as well. I think about this moroccan hash culero, i can get some in my region for about half the price it&#039;s sold here, and my region is farer from morocco than the guys who sell it.<br />Cocaine seems overpriced as well ? friend of mine gets much lower prices than cocaine sold here.

				oh yes it is expensive here for sure but nobody is making us part with btc.<br /><br />locally I have in the last twelve months bought or gone shares in various strains for between £150 and £180 per ounce. <br /><br />here £180 would buy you 3btc and approx 1/2 an ounce.<br /><br />hopefully prices come down and I will then purchase larger quantities, until then I will just sample a few grams here and a gram there. speciality toking.<br /><br />

				Are they on average a bit higher than you can find on the street? Yes, I would say so.<br /><br />However, you can ALWAYS find good bud here, and the community here is really great. <br /><br />I may pay a little more for my herb here, but I feel it&#039;s money well spent. And there are deals if you look around a bit.

				Best thing to do and a food for thought. Find a vendor you like and become a loyal customer..A lot of the vendors will 100% always hook you whether it&#039;s fat bag or a sample of some new stuff..And who knows vendors don&#039;t really do it but maybe give you that price you&#039;re looking for, among other things. So patience my young grasshopper.<br /><br />One more thing, if you do get hooked up keep it to yourself...That&#039;s one thing I hate when I serve people extras is when I get phone calls after from people asking where is theres.. lol
