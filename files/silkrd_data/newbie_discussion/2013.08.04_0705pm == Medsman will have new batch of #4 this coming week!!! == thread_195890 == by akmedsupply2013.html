				I got a half gram of his first sample batch and let me tell you .!!!! I am 45 years old and been doing H off and on for 15 years and this stuff takes me back he gets it in rock but crushes down for shipping which is very good stealth!! The express i paid for was to me in less than 24 hours and no signature required . The dope smelled so raw it made my nose twitch and the taste was almost so strong it will make you gag and the taste stays on&nbsp; your tongue for a long time, gotta get out the tooth brush!!! Ok so i snorted a small match sized bump and it felt really good and i was super pleased as i was relaxed and just had no worries it was like i was in a time machine when heroin was still euphoric!!! My husband does his different as he goes straight for the vein and he said it was the best #4 outside of freeways he had done on silk road and then it was close but said freeway was a tad bit better/ he was actually enjoyable to be around!! he said he started out with his had getting warm and fuzzy and spreading down to his feet until his whole body was basically pain free&nbsp; and that says alot as my husband was in a bad car wreck and has tried all of the main stream pain meds and has tried every vendor on here.<br />Our best top five list:<br />1.Freeway<br />2.Medsman<br />3.Gotsitall<br />4.Fivestar( simply because of her customer service but her dope wasnt near as strong)<br />5.Supremesmoke( now that i see his prices are down i would have to put him in 6the number 3 slot and move GIA 6to number five.<br /><br />The two best going are freeway and medsman but anyway medsman says he will have his listing back up the new week coming maybe mid week. dont hesitate or you are missing out!!!
