				Hello everyone, just wanted to introduce myself :) I am offering a great product at the lowest price on Silkroad, here is my official introduction:<br /><br />I am pharmacypowder. Although I am now a new vendor here on Silkroad, I have been involved in the substance mail order business for over 10 years and been involved with it using bitcoins for over a year and a half. I am very experienced in this business and can promise you the best customer service and only the best products all shipped for free in a very discreet, stealthy manner. I assure you that anything you order from me will look, feel and smell exactly like the millions of other pieces of mail Canada Post deals with on a daily basis. Dog&#039;s also are NOT trained to smell my product of choice as well so having a 100% delivery rate in this business is something I am very proud of. Sometimes I ship so discreet some customers have trouble finding the hidden product! Anyway, I chose the name PharmacyPowder because I specialize in shipping Canadian pharmaceutical Xanax (Alprazolam) powder! This powder is as pure as it gets, it made in Canada and I am lucky enough to know someone that works for a compounding pharmacy that has no trouble “diverting” ;) me as much of this beautiful powder as I need. Since it is Canadian pharmaceutical grade it is as pure as it gets. The quality control standards in Canada are very high and the company producing this powder distributes to all the big chain pharmacy’s in Canada, so you are not getting some street made or low quality foreign sourced product. 2MG of this powder is exactly like taking a 2MG name brand “bar” of Xanax. It has been lab tested and of course human tested by hundreds if not thousands ( I have been selling this product a long time) So, one gram of powder is equal to 500 2MG bars, the money you save is INSANE! Prices are the lowest on Silkroad And I will strive to always have the lowest price on Silkroad! Spending money on Xanax bars/pills will seem crazy once you try this powder!

				Thanks my man! Business is actually picking up very nice for me, even though it still says I have no completed orders it is because I allow EVERYONE to stay in escrow and this is officially only day 4 of me vending and day 3 of orders being mailed out so no one has received yet but very soon my page will be filled with feedback from very happy customers :) I have sent a couple half gram samples out to well known forum members that have experience writing honest reviews for vendors. I planned on sending&nbsp; a lot more samples to prove myself but business is already doing good as buyers have nothing to worry about. I paid silkroad $500 to be able to vend here and I do not get paid for my product until the customer receives it so it is impossible I could be a &quot;scammer.&quot; I plan on being here for the long haul and look forward to working with this wonderful community

				Ahh man, I wish I could&#039;ve gotten in on that freebie deal. I want to start writing more trip reports and reviews. So hey, if you need another guinea pig, shoot me a pm! I&#039;ve got quite a bit of experience with your product and I like to think I know my shit when it comes to benzos.<br /><br />I believe you that you&#039;re not a scammer. You seem honest enough, and your logic against dropping $500 to scam people is solid, but everybody&#039;s gotta be a little skeptical with new vendors, ya know? It&#039;s just good practice.<br /><br />btw, we&#039;ve been corresponding on SR. I go by a different alias here, though. It helps to keep an air of mystery.&nbsp; muahahah

				Well, here&#039;s my review of pharmacypowder, who sells alprazolam powder, pure, for a pretty great price. It&#039;s $140/gram, which is equal to 500 bars. You can find vendors selling 10 bars for $50+. Anyways, I over a month ago I ordered a half-gram, to try it out. I live on benzo&#039;s like many of you breathe, so I would have ordered more but he was a new (&lt;10 transactions) at the time so the purity wasn&#039;t yet clear.<br />He marked it in transit immediately, and I expected about an 8 day wait (he ships from the same Province in Ontario my family lives, so I&#039;m used to that mail route). Well, nothing comes, and I get a bit worried. I&#039;ve had many international orders, and no problems, and while I hadn&#039;t gotten a love letter I was still antsy. I proposed a 10-day extension (I have had packages from the next state over get routed over 5000miles before getting to intended target and understand the problems with our Postal Service) and waited. Still nothing. The day before the extension is to end, I log on to find a message from pharmacypowder. This is paraphrased but it basically said that he had gone over everything, talked to the admins, and was absolutely certain that the postal service lost it (he&#039;s since put up a notice catching a scammer, so don&#039;t pull any shit; I had proof :) ) and offered me a reship AND refund, since this was a first time occurrence. I accepted, of course, and left him a feedback that was 5/5 but made sure to explain he deserved more than that. We probably exhanged 15-20 messages, and he struck me as an honest guy, always quick to respond and very polite. <br />Fast forward a week, and lo and behold my product is here. That was a couple days ago, I&#039;ve been in a bit of a blur this weekend. However, on Friday I was able to sneak a pinch back into work and GC/MS it: the impurity was less than the margin of error. His claim of 100% pure is accurate.<br />Anyways, looking for bulk Xanax, check this guy out. Not only is he affordable and his product excellent, he&#039;s the most stand-up, down-to-earth vendor I&#039;ve yet to deal with. Cheers...

				I can vouch for pharmacypowder as well!&nbsp; Product is amazing.&nbsp; Shipping is fast!&nbsp; One week from placing order to arriving to lower east coast US.&nbsp; Also great communication.&nbsp; Seems like a nice guy.&nbsp; Not one of those vendors that seem annoyed by any question you may have...<br />Id recommend and do business again.&nbsp; Best deal on xannies on SR right now....

				Hello,<br /><br />I am one of the recent few who had a bad experience dealing with this vendor. The following is copied from my post in http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168743 for increased visibility.<br /><br />I placed an order with Pharmacypowder about 6 weeks ago and never received anything after continuing to extend for well over 30 days, based on his repeated assurance that it would arrive and that the unreasonably long wait was due to the unpredictability of Canada mail, in itself understandable. He claimed to have had one order take 29 days to the US. It was clear, potential shipping mishaps and all things considered, that nothing would be coming after 4+ weeks. The way he handled my inquiries was pretty indicative of selective scamming. He was totally unwilling to work with me to remedy the situation, and actually offered me an insulting 5% refund. It sucks to take a hit on buyer stats because of unscrupulous vendors, but I&#039;m not OK with losing my money for nothing more than to preserve refund %. A real shame too, it would have been awesome to have a solid Alprazolam powder vendor, especially at his prices. Someone who can actually do business the right way and hasn&#039;t had any problems with this guy should step up and reship his product from inside the States.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Layob
