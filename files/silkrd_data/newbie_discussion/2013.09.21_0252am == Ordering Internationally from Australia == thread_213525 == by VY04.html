				Hey Guys, well im fairly new to Silkroad and have made about 7 orders on here but all have been domestic within Australia. But I was just curious as from what I have read Australia have very good customs. <br /><br />My main questions were:<br />If I do order from Europe or somewhere is there a high chance that it will get stopped at the border?<br />What happens If my order is stopped at the border, will i expect a visit from the pigs?<br />And When ordering do I use a fake name but my real address?<br /><br />Any help or tips would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Everytime I&#039;ve heard the word &quot;Australia&quot; mentioned on the silkroad or anywhere in .onion land, it has been one of the following:<br />A Australian vendor advertising to other Autralians<br />OR (more commonly)<br />A vendor saying they won&#039;t ship to australia without FE b/c of customs / A buyer complaining about how their shipment was stopped by customs. <br />My advice; stay domestic.

				Oh alright, thanks! I know it sounds weird but I really want to collect some pressed pills from europe and that haha. Would love to collect the white skulls, androids, mortal combats, Mario Bullets. Just reckon it would be really cool to get some. <br /><br />Does anyone know what happens if a small package of around 10 pills gets stopped by customs? Just curious.

				I think it&#039;s worth a shot if the deal is much better than domestic, and it&#039;s something which is less easy to detect (think odourless paper LSD vs smelly bulky things). And most importantly that it&#039;s from a country that isn&#039;t highly suspicious. As in, something from the Netherlands would most likely be looked at more closely for example.

				Been using the road for about 4-5 mths from au and was ordering small amounts of powders from international vendors 1-2 times a week for the first 6-8 weeks without incident. After this accumulation of confidence in our customs lack of detection skills I decided to chance a somewhat larger order. Needless to say it was intercepted. Within 7 days I had a seizure notification from au customs in lieu of ordered items. I spent the next few weeks listening for helicopters and waiting for the front door to get kicked in. When paranoia subsided a few weeks after that, I got a new address I could reliably retrieve orders from and just keep my orders to under 2-3 grams and I haven&#039;t had a problem since (knock on wood). <br />I think around SRs inception there were probably some ausy junkies that duded a heap of international vendors and left a perpetuating myth that our customs are somehow more advanced than any other first world country. I dont know about you, but I dont feel as though our international reputation is one of cutting edge early adoption of tech anything, let alone policing/detection tech. <br />Keep it out of the kilo range and you should be right.
