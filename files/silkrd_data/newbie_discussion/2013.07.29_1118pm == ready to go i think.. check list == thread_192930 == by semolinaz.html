				Been lurking around here for a good while now so thought I might as well get my post count up. Here&#039;s my checklist so far.. think I may be ready to go<br /><br /><br />*tails usb/persistance done<br /><br />*PGP sorted<br /><br />*email account done<br /><br />*localbitcoins &amp; blockchain sussed out (i think)<br /><br />*find a decent localbitcoin seller that excepts cash bank deposit (not done yet). Set up a transaction with them including my wallet address at blockchain where I want the coins sent to, deposit cash, wait for coins, finalize escrow.<br /><br />*move coins from wallet to SR &lt; no need for bitcoinfog or whatever as it was a cash deposit?<br /><br />*find a vendor thats good to except an order from newbs &amp; check I don&#039;t have to finalize early or sign for the package, maybe pgp message them to confirm? Check vendor profiles/feedback.<br /><br />*use checkout &amp; send coins to vendor in SR. I hope this bit goes well &amp; is self-explainitory<br /><br />*receive my package &amp; finalize in SR.&nbsp; Take necessary precautions for a day or two. <br /><br />**Get high<br /><br />still a few uncertanties in my list though :)

				your on the right track just add one more to your list<br /><br />-Dont tell nobody your using silkroad<br /><br /><br /><br />i think a list like this should be on the registration page prior to registering on silkroad advising new vendors/buyers to take those safety precautions before using the sites services <br /><br />enjoy your time on the road ( not doubting for a second you wont )<br />peace

				Thanks, glad Im doing things right. Ok, so ill use a bitcoin fogger thing - what are the tried &amp; tested ones? Bitcoinfog? <br /><br />Not sure about FE, I have found a few vendors that dont require it with newbs, they are around if you have a good look.<br /><br />Oh a few more things for the list -<br /><br />*turn java off in browser (sometimes need to turn back on again briefly as places like localbitcoins need it on some pages)<br />*change wallet address at each new purchase &lt; does this mean ALL wallet adresses..blockchain..SR etc. ??
