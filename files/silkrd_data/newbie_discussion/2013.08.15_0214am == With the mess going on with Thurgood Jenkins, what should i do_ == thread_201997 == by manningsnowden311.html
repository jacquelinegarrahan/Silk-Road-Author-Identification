				I ordered a small amount of bud (1/8) late saturday night, before all the love letters came crashing in.&nbsp; He said he is still filling orders made before he went into stealth mode.&nbsp; Question is, should I cancel this order or wait it out? Its been processing for going on 4 days, with no response to messages and he hasn&#039;t been on SR in about 2 days, which isn&#039;t normal for him.&nbsp; He&#039;s usually on everyday.&nbsp; So is he just lying low or has he jumped ship?&nbsp; Any input would be great.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll cancel if he doesnt respond by tomorrow night or so.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

				Can&#039;t speak to what Thurgood is up doing or up to.&nbsp; I did read about those love letters though.&nbsp; If I were you I would cancel as soon as it becomes available.&nbsp; It&#039;s an 8th so while I can&#039;t say for certain but if that&#039;s all you&#039;ve ordered you&#039;ll be fine either way.&nbsp; You might get a letter for that amount but that&#039;s it.&nbsp;

				He stopped responding to my&nbsp; messages around the same time but I still got my ounce in the mail. It was beautiful. 4 strains and overweight.<br /><br />Mine was sent out the same day as the love letters I think.

				Did it ever switch to &quot;in transit&quot; before it arrived? Mine has been processing still.
