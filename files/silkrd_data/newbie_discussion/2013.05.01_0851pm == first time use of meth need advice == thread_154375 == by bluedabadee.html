				If you experience bad side effects beyond a certain dose, don&#039;t go beyond that dose. If 50mg is your limit, keep it to 45mg, this applies to all drugs.<br /><br />Meth is extremely addictive(Thank you captain obvious), so it&#039;s a good idea to stay on low doses anyway.<br /><br />I will never understand why people don&#039;t think they can enjoy hard drugs in moderation like they would with alcohol and caffeine.

Weed will increase the risk of getting paranoia/anxiety, hamper his co-ordination(A dangerous impairment when combined with the energy of meth) and raise his heart rate even further.<br /><br /><br />Seriously, 50mg is obviously your limit. Think of it like alcohol, if you vomit after drinking 5 beers, would you look for a way to not vomit when drinking 5 beers or would you just stick to 4 beers and strike a happy balance between intoxication and self-respect?

				Curious as to why you even wanted to dabble,&nbsp; :-\ as a fellow drug aficionado I love foreign substances in my bloodstream but meth I have never and will never touch. All types of psychedelics, RC&#039;s, molly, benzos, weed, etc. etc. I will take with no hesitation but from what I&#039;ve heard the potential risks of abuse and addiction arent worth the high as there are similar substances that can make you feel similar chemically.&nbsp; But to each his own, and I agree with all other posts, proceed with caution.

				doing molly but saying hell no to meth is a fairly arbitrary distinction if you ask me the A in MDMA is &quot;amphetamine&quot;

The worst thing you can do when you crash is more meth, that&#039;s how you get hooked, so when you start to crash you need to just accept it and drink some tea, take some vitamins and generally take care of your body.<br /><br />Meth is a great experience but it can go horribly wrong if you aren&#039;t careful. Enjoy your ride man, might I suggest that you listen to some music.

				I guess I&#039;m the worse violator of my own advice, but I hate stim crashes so much that I never do them unless I know I&#039;m gonna have something to alleviate it (that isn&#039;t alcohol), benzos, opiods. even benadryl (but don&#039; take too much) can help you out alot - don&#039;t smoke weed on a comedown because that will make you freak out

				why did i want to try it because it is the only thing i have never experienced and kush has unusually pure meth that is very smooth and euphoric and exciting and i never have had that experience from and amphetamine before i can go through a good 8 ball of coke in a few hours and have very few effects except from psychosis it just never worked for me but i love the idea of having energy i have severe chronic fatigue syndrome that has hurt my relationship with everyone i have ever loved for years and the fact that after 6 hours of sleep i can wake up and smile today makes it worth it music i normally require between 16-18 hours of sleep a day to be a normal human being it has almost deystroyed my life thankfully there is a new type of IV treatment which i am doing which is helping to become normal but i wanted a day to myself just to be happy to smile because i had the energy to do everything i every wanted to do everyone of you knows what that feels like otherwise you would never have tried drugs i just wanted to smile again and it worked now will i do it again for a while absolutely not never had an addictive personality but will there be days where i will smile again every 2-3 weeks absolutely i feel like busting out and singing a whole new world right now sorry for the repetitive rambling its bringing out some emotions right now that i usually bottle im really thankful that you all responded so quickly i never even thought someone would write back :) ANY GOOD CHOICES FOR MUSIC :)??? PS. apples taste like cardboard wrapped in sand :( but my teeth apparently are food processors cause my jaws turned it into apple sauce before i realized i had chewed
