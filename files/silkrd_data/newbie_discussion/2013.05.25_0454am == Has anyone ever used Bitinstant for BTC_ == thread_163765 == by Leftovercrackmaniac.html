				I am new to this whole thing and have no way of getting BTC other that Bitinstant but I have never used them. I plan to do this on the 31st of may and was curious as to how reliable this BTC source is. I don&#039;t mind being charged their fees and whatnot, I just want a quick way to get BTC and to be able to rest assured that my money isn&#039;t going to a scam.<br />

				Yes lots of people use them everyday. They are legit. They;re might be a wait but usually it&#039;s less than 24 hours before your get your coins.

				Haven&#039;t tried Bitinstant yet myself, but from the people I have spoken with. It works even if it&#039;s a little slow at times. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a good tutorial. ;)<br /><br />http://vimeo.com/44849463

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				I have had great experiences with Bitinstant, the fees are annoying but the three times I used it worked great and I got the bitcoin in my mtgox within 10 minutes of it going through.&nbsp; The only problem I ever had was the clerk at the store didn&#039;t know how to work the moneygram service, unrelated to Bitinstant but just make sure you get a transaction code when they give you a receipt.

				Of course mate, as everyone is saying. Through moneygram, it&#039;s perfectly fine. Moneygram does ask for name and some other information. You can use a false one, but I never have.

				I will stay away from that for sure then hahaha. I believe I will use Bitinstant as I am seeing many great reviews from REAL people here on the road. A lot harder to distinguish on clear-net reviews because I can&#039;t tell whether it&#039;s people from Bitinstant making false 5/5 reviews of if it&#039;s competitors making false bad reviews. <br /><br />Also About how much money is taken out as fees in the whole process?

				Why stay away from mtgox? After using the exchange to get bitcoins just transfer to your wallet thats where the trail ends. How else do you get bitcoins without going through an exchange?

				I just used bitinstant today for the second time.&nbsp; first time everything worked fine.&nbsp; this time when i purchased coins, i purchased $249.00 worth....&nbsp; which after fees, was supposed to give me $239 which is what i needed.&nbsp; now after the transaction has had it confirmations, it only gave me a total of around $234.&nbsp; so i somehow got screwed out of a few dollars which now makes my account balance $3 shy of the amount i need.&nbsp; has anyone ever had this issue before?&nbsp; or know what i can do to get my full amount i should have gotten?&nbsp; i did the math beforehand so i knew EXACTLY what to purchase.&nbsp; i dont like buying too many coins and then having them sit in my wallet.
