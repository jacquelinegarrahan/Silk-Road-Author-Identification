				I keep reading people claiming that SR tumbles the BTC in their system but can&#039;t find anything to backs that up. Looking at the buyer and seller guide doesn&#039;t make that clear.<br />

				Yes but it is not efficient.&nbsp; Look at the Casey Jones case.&nbsp; His coins went through a wallet that had seen more than a half a million coins.&nbsp; It is also easy to identify addresses that are associated with Silk Road and the Silk Road reuses addresses.&nbsp; I hope that this answer satisfies you.

				So in other words something like bitcoinfog should be used. Casey Jones? Haven&#039;t heard of that one yet. What did he fuck up on?

				-----Levine said law enforcement might have gotten hold of a computer that contained an unencrypted key to the electronic “wallet” where Hughes’ coins were held. More likely, he said, is that the DEA set up an online sting operation involving a transaction on Silk Road.-------<br /><br />The article is too vague as to what went down exactly. Certainly can&#039;t hurt to bitcoinfog though.
