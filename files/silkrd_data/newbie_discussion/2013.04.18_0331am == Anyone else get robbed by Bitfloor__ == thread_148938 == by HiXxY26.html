				copy and pasted from the Bitfloor closed today thread..<br /><br />Bitfloor / LocalTill, LLC stole $412 from me.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />I made a deposit on mon 4/15 and they say it never went through. I emailed them for support about 3 hrs after since it was taking awhile to go through and did not here back from them till the next day. They asked for a copy of the deposit receipt. I emailed a copy. They said &quot;We have no such deposit. Please follow up with the bank to ensure they have properly credited out account.&quot;<br />I went back to the bank today to verify and the bank verified it went through &quot;almost immediately&quot;... Now I come home from the bank and email them again. Log in to these forums and see this thread&nbsp; :-[ :-[ Im so pissed right now&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( I have no Idea what to do. This was my first time trying to buy BTC too. I did my research and everyone on the forums had nothing but good things to say about Bitfloor. Now i&#039;m out a lot of $ and feel like shit. I mean i would at least not feel as bad if I got scammed by a vendor or something illegal. But buying bitcoins through a reputable website. At least I thought it was.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />If anyone has any advise for me on how I can get my $ back please do tell.<br />I guess I will try Bitinstant next.

				I used bitfloor for the first time today. I got my money into btc right around 5PM, and I consider myself stupidly incredibly lucky for that. Had success with bitinstant a month ago by the way, but have heard bad things since then.<br /><br />Good luck with everything.

				*Update*<br /><br />Bitfloor posted this message yesterday...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2013.07.24<br /><br />IAFCU asks all users to remain patient as they process requests as quickly as possible. The first sets of payments should be going out soon for IAFCU account holders.<br /><br />Users with account balances under 3,000 USD are urged to remain patient as IAFCU must check each persion individually. IAFCU has informed us that they have hired more staff and obtained additional software to process users. Their initial estimates for these accounts is the week of August 5th.<br /><br />Additionally, due to the regulatory checks which IAFCU must perform, the fee for fund return is now 5 USD. We are assured that this is the final fee and all account holders are subject to this fee to receive your funds.<br /><br />International users will be processed after IAFCU is able to begin processing some US based accounts. Again, I appreciate everyone&#039;s patience as we work to return funds through this long ordeal.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />my $400 still shows up in my bitfloor account so maybe I might get a refund. Not really counting on it though. guess we&#039;ll see :o

				And this is why I use coinbase. May have to wait a week but that&#039;s why you buy the coins in bulk.

				yeah I have used coinbase in the past and it works flawlessly. I was thinking about trying out localbitcoins because of the good reviews but to be honest CB works great unless you are trying to buy stuff that week.
