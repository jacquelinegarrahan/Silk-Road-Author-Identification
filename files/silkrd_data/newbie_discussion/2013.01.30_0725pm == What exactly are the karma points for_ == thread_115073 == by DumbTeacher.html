				Could someone please explain to me what is the purpose of the karma points? I mean are they just in place so that a person can say that they do and or don&#039;t like another person? I know that my karma is probably gonna get smashed for asking, but... c&#039;est la vie.

				I run forums elsewhere. <br /><br />The karma system is there to help the community self-moderate. <br /><br />If you&#039;re being a dick and get loads of -ve karma, it might make you think &quot;hmmm...perhaps I should chill out a bit...&quot;&nbsp; If you get loads of +ve karma then it usually means that you&#039;re a good community member and worth listening to. <br /><br />On some forums it works, on others the system just gets abused in a tit-for-tat fashion.

				Karma&#039;s programmed as a feature in SMF-run software like Silk Road forums. It can be made invisible at admin&#039;s discretion but on this forum (like most) it is available for viewing. whitenegro, Kinetic and NCChronic pretty much answered it. Constructive or positive post, in theory, attract positive karma, while trolling will see an increase in negative karma. So a high neg to positive ratio will often indicate a troll, meaning you might be given a heads-up if you you look at the Karma beforehand. A high postive/low neg ration tends to indicate the opposite. Sadly some children press shiny red buttons on everyone here just for the hell of it and neg everyone on a page. You get that here b/c of the demographics.<br /><br />And yeah, I&#039;d LOVE to trade them for bitcoin...... ::)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Or you just get that one person that just does not like you or what you have to say for some reason.... that single person can ruin you otherwise perfect karma ratio.... I have found it kind of like highschool although it has been decades since I was in one... <br /><br />pat on the back or kick in the ass is what is boils down to....<br /><br />but when someone has a bunch of negative karma it could mean that they just tell it like it is and dont give a flying fart..... now take the recent scandal with lucydrop and tess... anyone who would have said they were out of line or were slinging low grade acid would have had there karma points in the negative for sure... but look at what has happened or what is happening.... lucydrop scammed a crapton of people including me.... and tess is sending out questionable tabs.... although I did receive four of Tess first tabs he sent out and they were great....<br /><br />so folks before you hit that karma button remember that what goes around comes around.&nbsp; both good and bad....
