				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/db02174496<br /><br />This member has 4 feedback, 3 of which seemed to me like sock puppets, and 1 feedback that was changed from positive to &quot;resolving issues with seller&quot;.<br /><br />His one and only listing (the one I bought, marketed as &quot;lsd&quot;), is now gone after I purchased it.<br /><br />His stealth was mediocre at best upon arriving, and the packaging seems very awkward and dodgy right off the bat.<br /><br />I got a numbing sensation after taking a single tab of his &quot;200ug LSD&quot; and the blotter was slightly bitter. After 10 minutes of my mouth getting number and number I spit the tab out (I ended up tripping just very slightly that night as I was afraid of it being RCs hence why I spit it out). As most people know, LSD does not have a taste &#039;nor does it numb the mouth. After messaging him asking about the numbness, this is the response I received:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hello,<br />The blotter is submerged in the lysergic acid diethylamide, as opposed to having the chemical dropped onto the tabs. Since my product is a high dosage, some numbing may occur.<br />~RW22</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very funny.<br /><br />How do I go about getting a full refund? Nothing was mentioned in the listing regarding refunds, and I feel I was sold bullshit product by a bullshit seller who lies to his customers. <br /><br />I will be trying a reagent test on the product soon, but I am not completely sure how to properly administer a test on blotter. Any advice?

				A post on the forum won&#039;t really bring you any closer to your goal. Try and work something out with the seller barring that a respectful message to SR staff might get his account shut down. To be honest though the prospect of a full refund is grim. In the future please know 200ug per blotter for lsd is almost always a lie and if you are a new user stick with well establish vendors.

				I contacted the seller but considering he flat out lied and told me that the numbing was normal, I doubt I&#039;ll be able to come to a resolution with him.

				This is literally a scenario of he said/she said. Yes, coming to a resolution in your favor, if you&#039;ve already finalized, will most likely be impossible. The only thing you can do is try to talk to support about it, and continue talking to the vendor. Though, I fear, this is a bit of a loss, but a good lesson for anyone on the road.

The vendor himself verified that the tabs cause numbness via SR PMs. This might as well be a confession that it is not real LSD.
