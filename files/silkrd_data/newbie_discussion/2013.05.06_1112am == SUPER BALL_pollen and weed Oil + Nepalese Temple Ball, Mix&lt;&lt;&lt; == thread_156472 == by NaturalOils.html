				Limited edition. SuperBall.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />It is soon coming to an end for NaturalOils on the beautiful SR! After long conversations with very interesting and knowledgable people in the community and after having time to asses the market we feel a new price of SuperBall would better reflect your damands while compensating us for all the hard work and thought we put into making it. We have 2 bags of SuperBall left curing which are soon to be opened...I am excited about this one :) enjoy!<br /><br />NEW PRICES:<br /><br />1g = $35<br />3g = $100<br />5g = $150<br /><br />If any of you beauties purchased some SuperBall recently that was not on any special offer and felt like you have been delt a heft hand...contact us and I am sure we can do something nice for you on your next order! ;)<br /><br />Here is our lab report: <br />(please note by looking at your nose, you sometimes miss whats around you; be the master of your own experiences) but don&#039;t thnk too much :)<br /><br />THC: 20.1%<br /><br />THCA-A: 2.0%<br /><br />CBD: 2.9%<br /><br />CBN: 0.9%<br /><br />---we have updated our returns policy, please read before ordering!<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />*Reviews*<br /><br />&quot;If you don&#039;t know me by now;.....&quot;<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1d89124673 <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />SuperBall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made in response to one simple realization: If pure hash oil from natural weed or kush weed oil are one of the purest and most energetic highs, on the one hand, while on the other hand it is a bitch to handle with a tendency to stick to things you can&#039;t smoke; either we can create complex machines to transport oil to brain, in the most waste efficient way... or... we could mix the oil with great hash and make it; easy to handle, transportable and tasty :)<br /><br />This, without ego, is our finest creation yet. We have been making hash and weed oil for quite a number of years from various strains of marijuana. We personally prefer indica hash and have traveled to the best (debatable) place in the world to find the perfect smoke. Nepal<br /><br />The raw ingredients of SuperBall are: kush weed oil, pollen oil and Nepalese temple ball which all come from Nepalese farms. The SuperBall is a unique product, uniting the best raw ingredients and ingenuity of marijuana lovers. We personally over see every stage...at every village, every road block, every border, every military check point and next to every nosy neighbor wondering &#039;what the hell that smell is&#039;. We have risked much to make this and are damn proud of it....If you have any questions I am the only person you would ever need to ask....please message me :) Of course there are certain limits to the questions :)<br /><br />What is it?:<br /><br />The mix is ~35%&nbsp; pure oil, half of which is obtained from, lowland growing, Nepal Kush weed; the&nbsp; other half is from fine mountain pollen. This oil is then mixed with &#039;Temple Ball&#039; charas (hash)...All three parts are from this years harvest! We do not know the THC content, if you have the capability to test please message us!<br /><br />Personally we found ~35% to be the best ratio... with more oil it is too sticky and hard to handle, which is why we made this product in the first place: to have an easy to handle smokable oil, of the best quality! It is worth noting that the oil when mixed with temple ball does not run to the end of the joint, but smokes consistently with every drag.<br /><br /><br />Please check our SR page (link in our signature for more information, and to purchase) <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1d89124673<br /><br />To conclude...enjoy the smoke and come back for more :P<br /><br />All the best<br />NaturalOils

				I made this account just to be able to review and promote for myself this most magnificent and wonderous of hashy goodness. Firstly I must preface this review by letting you all know I am&nbsp;not overly experienced with hash although am a seasoned SR buyer, 420 smoker, toker &amp; midnight joker. ;) A massive Thank You to NaturalOils, SR and mother nature that has given the opportunity to enjoy this truly wonderful product.<br /><br />Communications: NaturalOils is curteous, attentive and very oriented towards a smooth and mutually satisfying transaction. All messages have the feel of a vendor who is genuine and cares about their product, service and customers.<br /><br />Shipping: Order was placed on a weekend and like a professional messaged me to notify me the item would be packaged and sent at the start of the working week. True to their the vendor promptly marked the order &#039;In Transit&#039; first thing Monday morning as noted by the postmark on the package. NaturalOils states a 14 day turnaround is expected for orders and being International from a remote part of the world this is understable. My order though swiftly arrived in my mailbox defying the advertising transit times, making it all the past the borders of one of the&nbsp; &quot;toughest&quot; country&#039;s customs in the world in a respectable 9 days. <br /><br />Stealth: If I hadn&#039;t have realised where this delivery had come from I would have dismissed it as random junkmail or advertising. The level of stealth is amazing to say the least, the disguise used for this item is crafty and sneaky.Once the layers are torn off revealing a MBB containing your lushious goodies. I hope I have not revealed too much guys.<br /><br />The SuperBall! : Following the Vendor&#039;s instructions, promptly placed the MBB in the freeze for what seemed like an eternity but turned out to be only 20mins of ny impatient time. Opening the MBB proved difficult, as someone who is&nbsp; clumsy and not particularly good controlling my excitement, I chopped thru the MBB indiscriminately leaving bits stuck to pieces of foil bag all over my coffee table. However the magic of this masterfully created hash/oil/pollen mix is the easy to handle state of this concoction and those little bits I thought were lost were easily salvaged, sticking to the larger chunk of SuperBall with ease leaving no messy residue or sticky muck on my fingers. <br /><br />The first thing to be noted about the product is that it is Soft! Most of the hash I&#039;ve had experience with are either one of two extremes, solid and hard or clumpy and too soft, making them tough to work with. The SuperBall however suffers not from any of the issues I have previously dealt with making it easy to cone, roll, burn, blunt or eat. Yumm. <br /><br />The Taste Test: By trade, I am a bowlsmoker so I promptly packed a bowl with a generous sized matchstick head miniSuperBall. The resulting smoke that billowed from my Betty(Bong) was thick, aromatic and plentiful as I proceeded to attempt sinking the bowl. I must say this creation is not to be underestimated. I AM STONED and I haven&#039;t even finished that first bowl. WOW! The high as you would be able to tell so far is far from incapacitating which is hard to find where I&#039;m located as the local market is dominated by heavy indica &quot;knock you on your ass, cognitive shut down&quot; buds. I am loving the high, a feeling a equate to a gentle warm summer breeze whisping against your body and brain while having your nipples tickled. It is a truly amazing high experience. <br /><br />PEACE + LOVE = PARADISE and the SuperBall will take you there.<br /><br />For anyone out there that hasn&#039;t tried this. Do yourself, your mates, your grumpy ass uncle or grandma a massive favour and feel priviledged to enjoy the bliss and nipple tickle goodness of the SuperBall. <br /><br />Take advantage of the &quot;3 for the price of 1&quot; promotion before I buy it all!!

				Have to ask on this just cos I&#039;m curious and would like to know everything is still ok.<br /><br />I made an order for this 3 days ago and sent a PM.<br /><br />Have had no reply to PM nor has it been read and the order is still sitting processing.<br /><br />Is NaturalOils still around?&nbsp; Not sure if the order is still coming or whether I should cancel when the 4 days is up since they are MIA.<br /><br />If anyone has heard from them had an order updated or anything in the last 3 or 4 days, please let me know since I need to decide one way or another.<br /><br />If they are not around its a shame as I had my heart set on this product :(<br /><br />Cheers guys - Tel

				Hey TMT<br /><br />I&#039;m not too sure where these guys are, can only assume they&#039;re busily away packing the next round of orders but I can assure you that you don&#039;t want to be late this party. I shot em a message as well so hopefully they&#039;ll find your order get back to ya soon. Give it up until the end of the processing deadline and save those BTC&#039;s when you can in contact with them. Seems uncharacteristic of them, they are the most soulful and kindhearted vendors I&#039;ve encountered in my time here. <br /><br />GoodLuck

				Can anyone compare and contrast the Super Ball to American made hashes?<br /><br />Is it closer to bubble hash, or BHO???

				@NaturalOils<br />Just spreading the love as you guys have done for those of us on SR. AWESome product guys and no doubt there will be another order in the works very soon my friends. I also noticed you guys finally got your vendor stripes today too ;D<br /><br />@TMT<br />Good things come to those wait bud ;) Hope you get to enjoy your SuperBall soon! <br /><br />@CUPIDO<br />As I stated in my review, not an experienced hash aficionado unlike some around these boards, but I would hazard a guess to say that you&#039;ll get the best of both worlds in this. The first thing to remember is that this is basically 3 forms of cannabis condensed into one awesome product. The second thing is you really should consider is the genetics of the bud it is made from to know whether or not its the high you are after. If you&#039;ve tried some Afghan origin Kush, I&#039;d say its pretty close to that high, not super intense couch-lock, &quot;whats my name again&quot; indica but a more relaxed smoooth cruise high that is more mellow and laid-back than the Big Lebowski bowling over 10 pins at the alley yet somewhat energizing at the time.<br />If you read the SuperBall description it&#039;ll tell you most of what you need to know anyhow. IMHO Handrubbed Charas (hash), of which I&#039;m pretty sure this stuff is, is the BEST Hash that the heavens and mother earth can give us. There is a tradition and sacred ritual behind this stuff that really makes you appreciate your 420&#039;s a little more. If you really wanna find out more, YouTube &quot;Strain Hunters&quot; or &quot;Charas&quot; OR if this New Age hippydippy stuff doesn&#039;t sway ya, just order the SuperBall, and I personally guarantee you, that you will never smoke another form of hash again. It ain&#039;t called the SUPER-Ball for nothing. <br /><br />Get on it!<br /><br />PEACE IN &amp; OUT &amp; ROUND - A - ABOUT

				@superstupor<br />THANK YOU for your kind words, wise advices and overall support to us and SuperBall... we sometime wonder how lucky we are to have reached people like you!!! definitely good karma angels :)<br /><br />@CUPIDO<br />Thank you for your interest :) To answer your question in all honesty, I have to say I am inexperienced with American Hash...however the age, variety and chemicals used in synthetic growing environments or fertilizers in outdoor environments..stress the plants an add adulterants to the end product...or they cook weed plants in other products to produce a similar consistency to hash...or you get great people who make honest stuff...as a customer I recommend try yourself...smell, taste, and feel the high and you will find what you like :)<br />But we can tell you what the SuperBall is, or better have a look at our private page and review page to see the reviews of people who tried it...try your self and judge the difference :)<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Natural Oils

				Well Hello There,<br /><br />Our opening offer has now finished!! Thank-you for all those that have tried and all those eagerly awaiting the arrival of your first SuperBall.<br /><br />Our new offer, for the fun of it, is that every week, on the 5g product listing below, we will add 3 discounted 5g packages at the cost of only $150...you save $100...there will only be 3 a week and we will add them randomly and without announcement...good luck and check us regularly. 1 person can order: only one per week!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/58ae2d2f66<br /><br />Curing *update*,... only a few orders left before our first batch of SuperBall is finished.... !So! our first cured bag will probably be opened next week...** I will say, I have sampled it&nbsp; ...it looks and feels better different : more cold resistant (was still very squidgy at 10 degrees C)...smoother...not sure if it is stronger...but have sent both the first SuperBall and the Cured one to a lab in Europe for tests....I will publish the results here over the next few weeks!<br /><br />Those who have tried SuperBall don&#039;t forget: if you leave a review on this page: you automatically enter a monthly lottery with the possibility to win 3 grams&nbsp; ....some say it&#039;s cheap...but honest reviews are essential here.
