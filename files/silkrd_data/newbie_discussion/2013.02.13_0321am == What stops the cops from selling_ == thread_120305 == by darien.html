				Just wondering what is stopping the cops from making vendor accounts and acting as sellers only to bust anyone that orders?

				absolutely nothing... which makes it important that you read into the vendor&#039;s profile and reviews...

				I assume DPR has some kind of vetting process.&nbsp; This place is too well thought-out for something that simple to be a threat.

				That&#039;s why you buy from someone who has a decent amount of reviews. If they have 100% feedback, they could just be feeding their account. You can check the reviews and also the items bought. When you click the item button for many different reviews and it is all the same blank product with 0.01 price, then you should be weary.

				I would assume they would be more interested in the sellers, mostly bulk orders. It is too much hassle and not enough money to bag the little guys (the majority of buyers)

LE will be buyers trying to profile big vendors or making new alternative SR type sites as honeypots while trying to scare people away from SR. they&#039;re not the brightest bunch though..

				I read on SRF in another thread that the BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) got into a lot of hot water over selling numerous guns to known criminal drug dealers working for cartels, so if the news ever came out that the DEA or the FBI was actually selling &quot;dangerous and illegal&quot; drugs to the public, bad press and hearings in Congress would be the least of that agency&#039;s worries.&nbsp; Of course, that would be my assumption, and we all know what happens when you assume.&nbsp; It&#039;s also possible that if enough senators got on the case, law enforcement might feel the heat and try to turn a confidential informant into a vendor working for them, in an effort to find out who the vendor was selling weight to, giving them addresses and names to start in on.

				i doubt very much tehy could actaully sell something illegal that someone can take.<br /><br />so if they have over 5 feedbacks sayin good product ur prolly ok... but then if u wanna get paranoid them 5 buys could be from LE. ooooohhh....
