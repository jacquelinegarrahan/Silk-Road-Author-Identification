				Fucking Tool! Love that band, it&#039;s the thinking man&#039;s rock.<br /><br />Hardstyle and trance are my favorite genres of techno overall, and my favorite while rolling hands down, but unfortunately I enjoy dubstep the most out of any type of techno to listen to while tripping. It&#039;s one of those types of music I hate to love now that it&#039;s everywhere, especially with all of the shitty fake ass dubstep DJ&#039;s out there these days.<br /><br />Hipster bokchoy listened to dubstep before it was cool.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />But seriously I did...

				Haha dubstep.. I think the matter is that dubstep nowadays is just a kind of commercial shit. <br /><br />I know some cool dubstep songs ... (even if I prefer goa)

				Exactly, just look at Skrillex. His music isn&#039;t really even that good in my opinion, he was just joined the dubstep game when its mass popularity was in its infancy, and look how popular he became.<br /><br />If you want some good, real dubstep, look up some of the British producers. Rusko, Caspa, Dodge and Fuski make some solid tunes. Now THAT&#039;S some good dubstep.

				Definitely heard of shpongle, but haven&#039;t heard a lot of his stuff. If I&#039;m correct it&#039;s really trippy shit, but I don&#039;t remember if I like it or not.<br /><br />Will have to check it out again I guess! Any recommendations on his better stuff?

				Depends on what trip you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been hitting cactus derived psychedelic though and have been opting for ambient Trip-hop beats.<br /><br />Top tune for tripping at the moment is Whistling in tongues, by Felix Laband. 8) Have a look, let me know what you think:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnooKQBg3ys

				Best Shpongle album (imho) is Ineffable Mysteries... with the best track being Nothing Is Something Worth Doing. ;D<br /><br />As for my fave if I&#039;m at tripping at home (well, not my all time fave, but it&#039;s one that I always seem to end up listening to every single time) is Journey of the Sorceror by the Eagles.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rOMGIbY-9s
