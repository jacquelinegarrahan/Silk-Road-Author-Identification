Use the following instructions if you&#039;re in the USA and you won&#039;t be scammed, nor will you have to meet anyone.<br /><br />-- To start, open a throwaway account with Mt. Gox at https://mtgox.com/. No need to verify this account unless you&#039;re gonna be trading big money.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/add funds&quot;<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;BitInstant,&quot; which will give you instructions and your account number.<br />-- Go to BitInstant at https://www.bitinstant.com/<br />-- The reason you need a Mt. Gox account is that BitInstant doesn&#039;t sell bitcoins; you must trade for them at Mt. Gox. BitInstant allows you to immediately fund your Mt. Gox account so you can start trading.<br />-- Use the drop-down menu to select &quot;cash deposit&quot; and choose a local retailer, such as Wal-Mart or CVS.<br />-- Fill in your info and you will download a .pdf file with information for filling out a blue MoneyGram slip at Wal-Mart. Basically, you&#039;re &quot;paying a bill&quot; to ZipZap, Inc. and you will be entering their four-digit receive code and account number on the form. Use your real name, address, etc. on the MoneyGram. It doesn&#039;t matter, since everything will be laundered and untraceable by the time it gets to Silk Road. Use fake info for your Mt. Gox account, although I don&#039;t think it matters. Some people use fake names on the MoneyGram. I guess it doesn&#039;t make any difference, since they don&#039;t require ID. I used my real info because I was afraid of the transaction being flagged or cancelled.<br />-- Go to your local retailer, fill out the MoneyGram with the info provided from BitInstant, and pay for it with cash. There is a $3.95 fee.<br />-- You money will appear in your Mt. Gox account within 4 minutes--1 hour at the most (never takes that long).<br />-- Use the &quot;trade&quot; button to buy bitcoins.<br />-- Go to &quot;funding options/withdraw&quot; and use the drop-down menu to select &quot;bitcoins&quot; as your currency. Enter the amount and bitcoin address from Silk Road (find that on your SR account page--looks like this: 1GDGgeTfNrxdhmJokSP7EqVRZGXSFuSnfp)<br />-- If you have 5.67 bitcoins with Mt. Gox, transfer 5.66 to cover the transaction fee. Select the option for faster transfer (0.005 BTC).<br />-- It may take several hours for your bitcoins to show up, but they will. Once they are in your SR wallet, you&#039;re ready to order.<br /><br />I hope this helps. This is the fastest, most reliable way that I&#039;ve found to get bitcoins. If you bank with a major financial institution, you also have the option of transfering funds directly to BitInstant. While this doesn&#039;t involve leaving the house and taking out cash, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s any slower than using a MoneyGram. One drawback to this method is that you have to provide BitInstant with your banking username and password (scary!) BitInstant is reputable, but that is just information that I don&#039;t want to release.<br /><br />Let me know if you have questions or problems. I discovered Silk Road less than two weeks ago and spent an evening teaching myself all about Tor browsers, bitcoins, PGP, and everything else. It takes some doing, but it is worth it. Read the feedback, forums, encrypt your address, and don&#039;t FE. (Download Portable PGP at http://ppgp.sourceforge.net/, which has a very user-friendly interface.) While address encryption is not strictly necessary, it adds an extra layer of security to your purchase. I&#039;ve had three flawless transactions and I couldn&#039;t be happier.

				I have used localbitcoins a few times. So far so good and I use cash when buying. They have a form of escrow to protect yourself and the seller only gets the confirmation number after the coins are deposited into your localbitcoins wallet. The seller shows you this code and you then know it has been done. Don&#039;t ever show the seller the code before until they tell you what it is. Also, you can&nbsp; set up a laptop to make sure the bitcoins are delivered like the buyer has after he receives the cash in hand and transfers. I think it&#039;s great other than showing yourself to someone its anonymous.

				I&#039;ve done several transactions via localbitcoins, if both parties have mobile wallets and meet in a public place, and limit the amounts to something that&#039;s not worth robbing anyone for, at least the first times, it is very safe.<br /><br />Problems are if you are a seller with bad routines, and carry around large amounts of cash in an unsafe manner, sooner or later the wrong people are going to notice and maybe try something, but occasional users are very unlikely to get robbed if they just follow what I wrote above.

				Localbitcoins is pretty cool, really the only significant risks are as a seller (chargebacks, hijacked accounts etc).<br />Unfortunately they&#039;ve required phone/SMS verificiation for my country before any trades are allowed.. disappointing.<br /><br />Coinbase are ok, not too greedy fee-wise but that&#039;s irrelevant for the majority of us that don&#039;t live in the US - they only accept fiat tx&#039;s via US banks on US soil...<br /><br /><br />

				Besides the stuff that I posted back in January, here&#039;s some more (from my tutorial):<br /><br />###<br /><br />*** Avoid OnionWallet--it is a SCAM ***<br />&nbsp;<br />MORE ABOUT BITCOINS:<br /><br />Looking to buy &amp; sell bitcoins? There&#039;s lots of options.<br /><br />--&nbsp; https://bitinstant.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins, lots of options including MoneyGram. Fund Mt. Gox &amp; other exchanges. Now requires verification.<br />--&nbsp; http://tradebitcoin.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally. Best for remaining anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; https://localbitcoins.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Buy bitcoins with cash, in person, locally. Best for remaining anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; https://coinbase.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Link your bank account and buy bitcoins online. Instant transfers after 30 days &amp; full verification.<br />--&nbsp; https://www.nanaimogold.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Similar to BitInstant. Use MoneyGram &amp; Western Union to fund account.<br />--&nbsp; https://mtgox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet. Not compatible with Tor, requires verification.<br />--&nbsp; https://virwox.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Currency exchange, eWallet. Lots of options for funding account (buying BTC).<br /><br />BitInstant &amp; Mt. Gox are becoming more transparent; you must now verify your identity to use their services. Frankly, this changes nothing--the idea that you were ever &quot;anonymous&quot; on these clearnet-only sites was a flimsy one at best. Trading bitcoins is perfectly legal--and believe it or not, crypto currencies such as BTC can be used for more than just buying drugs on Silk Road.<br /><br />No matter what you do, you lose some or all of your anonymity when buying coins; therefore, you should &quot;launder&quot; them.<br /><br />Here are some Tor-compatible sites to route your coins through before depositing them at Silk Road, which itself acts as a tumbler:<br /><br />--&nbsp; https://blockchain.info/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet. Access only with Tor to remain anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; https://easywallet.org/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Anonymous eWallet. Access only with Tor to remain anonymous.<br />--&nbsp; http://www.bitcoinfog.com/&nbsp; --&nbsp; Launders bitcoins. Access only with Tor to remain anonymous.<br /><br />BitInstant, with or without Mt. Gox, is a breeze. Just send a MoneyGram from Wal-Mart or another retailer. You can also link your bank account. Unfortunately, the site is temporarily down as they make some improvements.<br /><br />https://localbitcoins.com/ is perhaps the easiest method for obtaining bitcoins. Find someone near you, meet them, pay cash for BTC. I&#039;ve used this option and it was fast and hassle-free. The transaction is more-or-less anonymous, depending on how you handle it.<br /><br />After purchasing your bitcoins through BitInstant or wherever, you might send them through Bitcoin Fog. Personally, I never have; others give the service a mixed review. Either way, the next step is to transfer your bitcoins to BlockChain and then EasyWallet; from there, send them to Silk Road. Use at least 2 - 3 anonymous, torified wallets before Silk Road; also, don&#039;t forget to get a new SR bitcoin address before/after every transaction, withdrawal, deposit, etc. You should be changing it constantly, even though SR launders coins with its own tumbler. Chances are slim that anyone would be paying attention, but why take a chance?<br /><br />###<br /><br />For more, visit http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=112029.msg765916#msg765916<br /><br />--Dr. Jay
