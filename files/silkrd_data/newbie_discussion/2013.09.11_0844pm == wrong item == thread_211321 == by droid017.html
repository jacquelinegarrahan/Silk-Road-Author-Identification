				A seller recently sent me a wrong item worth more than the one I ordered. Unfortunately I have no need or desire for what I received, should I expect him to re send the correct order?

				At least you were being honest about it!&nbsp; ;)<br />I&#039;d message the vendor and explain what happened. Wasn&#039;t your fault &amp; I&#039;m sure him/her don&#039;t want a bad rating, so my guess would be that they would reship it. You can always flip the stuff they sent you! Cha-Ching!<br />&nbsp;8)

				I had this happen to me once.&nbsp; I ordered xanax and got a bunch of molly lol.&nbsp; It was my first order on the road too and believe me I was really nieve at that point in time because I actually thought the molly was xanax at first.&nbsp; But after some research I quickly realized what I had in hand.&nbsp; Anyways, I contacted the vendor and told him what happened.&nbsp; What he did was send out another package with DOUBLE the xanax I ordered.&nbsp; Yeah that&#039;s right a 10 pill order turned into a 20 one which was sweet.&nbsp; The vendor also sent me a self addressed prepaid label so I could mail the molly back to him.&nbsp; The problem was I tried one of the pills (supertrips green question mark 120 mg) and I was blown away and wanted to keep the batch.&nbsp; But I didn&#039;t want to fuck the vendor over.&nbsp; Also, on the self addressed return label the vendor sent me it had my shipping address as the return address.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t at all comfortable with having that as the return address.&nbsp; Especially since I was moving a long way that week and the place I would be mailing from was a long way from the zip code on the return address.&nbsp; So the vendor said that I could send them bitcoin for the molly and I did!&nbsp; I think they gave me a good price too I paid around $10 per pill.&nbsp; My original order ended up auto finalizing through this long drawn out process and to date is the only flaw in my SR stats.&nbsp; So as you see I could have easily screwed the vendor over but that&#039;s bad karma and that&#039;s not the kind of person I am.&nbsp; I started off with positive karma on SR and it&#039;s been paying dividends every since.&nbsp;

				Message him explaining the situation and explaining you&#039;d prefer the original, hopefully he&#039;l send the real order :) If s/he wants the wrong order back too send it, but i doubt he&#039;d want to lose his privacy over a small mistake
