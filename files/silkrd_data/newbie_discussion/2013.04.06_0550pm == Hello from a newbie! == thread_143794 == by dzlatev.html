				Hello SR !! <br /><br />I am completely newbie . This is my first post and I want to say hello !<br /><br />This is completely new thing to me and I am looking forward to educate myself of how to make my first order without problem. <br /><br />I read the tread where it is explained how to obtain BTC and how to start using them ( very helpful ) ! <br /><br />Another thing that I would appreciate is to get an idea , if there is someone who might send a little sample free of charge ( if thats even possible to new members like me ofc ) <br /><br />I do my homework and secured my computer ( TOR , Kleopatra thing etc. ) <br /><br />Another thing that it might be helpful to me would be an user , who is willing to sell me single BTC so I can do my first order.&nbsp; Is there any ? <br /><br />If someone could refer me to treads where its pointed out some additional information , please post .. ! <br /><br />Thanks !&nbsp;

				Hi!<br />I don&#039;t think anyone will send you a free sample... As for getting bitcoins, it depends on where you are to find a seller. I do advise using localbitcoins.com to get bitcoins (since you&#039;re not in the US) rather than buying from a seller on here, you could get scammed. Localbitcoins helps you find bitcoin sellers near your area and you arrange a meeting where you pay cash, and the guy sends bitcoins to your wallet right in front of you. It&#039;s a lot safer than sending money to someone you don&#039;t know in my opinion, and also cheaper since the sellers on here take huge fees.

				It depends what drug you&#039;re looking for but lots of vendors have &quot;sample&quot; listings. They&#039;re usually 1-2 dose quantities. If anything goes wrong they&#039;re usually small enough that you don&#039;t have to worry about cops (it just gets nicked @ customs in most countries), and the monetary risk is small. <br /><br />Vendors know that people won&#039;t drop a grand without sampling the stuff first - you can also PM a vendor and see if they&#039;ll do a smaller quantity, but I&#039;d wait until you have a few transactions under your belt. Buy an ebook or something from the site first to get an idea of how it works. Use PGP, etc.
