				I have also sent my private info thru the SR messaging system unencrypted.&nbsp; I&#039;m not worried.&nbsp; Always kept my stash in my room and it&#039;s staying there.<br /><br /><br />Maybe one day I&#039;ll get a knock on the door and wish I had cleaned out.

				I hope you don&#039;t use the same username as you did on SR Marketplace.<br /><br />DEA always go after dealers over consumers. I wouldn&#039;t really worry, but your info is there unencrypted, so I would at least DBAN your computer. If you have any drugs in your house... well its up to you what you want to do with them.

				I guess I&#039;m showing my age not bothering to learn PGP. When I was younger I would have.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never used either my SR username or this one on clearnet. As I said, I&#039;ve been prescribed pretty much everything I&#039;ve ever ordered from SR at some point in my life so.. I guess I&#039;m not THAT worried. More curious if anything. Even if they did start coming after buyers to make an example out of us, I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;d be more interested in the person buying heroin or cocaine than the insomniac who occasionally needs a benzo or 2 to sleep.<br /><br />or 4.. on nights like I suspect tonight&#039;s going to be ;) lol.

				even unencrypted, i think small personal use is ok-with all the buyers here there is no way they can hit all of us and sellers too. in any case=so they have an order(s) and your info-how can they prove it got to you with no controlled delivery. seems they would have to catch you with the goods-im just sayin. what do yall think?

				If you&#039;re strictly a buyer, especially with a low total spent, I doubt flushing your shit would be needed. But in all reality the feds could issue warrants for the local PD to fuck with lower level users. Hopefully that&#039;s way out of their budget. I&#039;m worried about the info in the resolution center. And users that used 2048 bit encryption or less. I&#039;ve heard that can be bruteforced.
