				Howdy, I&#039;ve made several purchases off of the road over the last few months, however, this has all been from a single cash deposit through bitinstant way back when when you could fake your ID.<br /><br />However, with their new site, it looks like you can&#039;t get around providing legitimate information (I did some searching on the bitinstant site and they check to make sure the info you provide is not false, even when doing guest check out).<br /><br />So here&#039;s my question: Is it safe to buy bitcoins with bitinstant using your real information and then sending them strait to my SR wallet? <br /><br />I only ask this because 1. I want a simple process to get btc and 2. I have heard that it is relatively safe to do this since &quot;buying bitcoins and exchanging them is not illegal&quot;<br /><br />

				It&#039;s safe and legal to buy BTC with your real information<br /><br />SR will tumble your BTC so it&#039;s also safe to transfer them from that wallet to this one. If you&#039;re really paranoid just open a second wallet anonymously and transfer them to that one first, but there really is no need

				I&#039;d just use Blue Sky Traders and continue to buy them anonymously.. Obviously bitcoins are legal but a money trail between someone and a bitcoin exchange isn&#039;t very good if the police seizes some of your packages and it can probably be used to have an easier time getting a warrant. If you&#039;re not using bitcoins to trade on trading platforms to make money then it&#039;s kind of obvious you&#039;re on SR.<br /><br />Buying ephedrine and glassware with your real ID isn&#039;t illegal either but it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s good idea :P

				Sentinental: Have you personally done this?<br /><br />tree: I&#039;d use blue sky traders, but there is not a Bank of America around me at all.<br /><br />My main thing is, can i use the method above and not have police waiting for me at my po box?

				Any sort of paper trail that can lead to your actual identity is to be avoided for optimal anonymity.

				I&#039;ve heard that a good btc washing service is Bit Fog, but I&#039;ve never used them personally...&nbsp; http://fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion/<br /><br />Check it out.. It&#039;s cheaper than most btc exchange services on SR that charge like 10%--they only take 1-3%.

				You can definitely still use fake information... If you pay cash at moneygram they don&#039;t ask for ID. Just use the same information you used on bitinstant when you go in and fill out the form and pay. If they ask for an ID... simple answer, oops I forgot it. If they don&#039;t let you do it. Go to another moneygram location. They have never asked me for an ID.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

Just from purchase with your ID to SR, would not be a wise choice. Blockchain and Sr both tumble the coins before the final deposit for better anonymity. <br /><br />To be extra safe, seeing as how it seems your set on using your ID, yes use bitfog.

				What PsychedelicSphere??&nbsp; I did a MG transfer last night and they definitely asked for ID and would&#039;ve required it, although she didn&#039;t notice that the names weren&#039;t the same (I think she was more concerned with how cute I was... lol) and I definitely used a fake name, I just got lucky...&nbsp; That was at a CVS though, which I wouldn&#039;t recommend using for MG/WU transfers because you have to do the little red phone BS.<br /><br />Walmart probably doesn&#039;t ask for ID as often, but you can never be sure... Just my experience, YMMV.

				It&#039;s safe. Ish.<br /><br />When an exchange asks you for ID for hitting certain limits and stuff, those are IRS and such financial regulations... it sucks when it happens, but you&#039;re not going to get arrested for buying coins.<br /><br />I agree, using tumblers and foggers, and you&#039;re fine. I wouldn&#039;t do a LOT of bitcoinage on-the-record tho, if you&#039;re like... also selling drugs. That&#039;s probably going to lead to bad things!&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />Blue Sky Traders don&#039;t ask for ID, and I contact them through a new tormail account every time. haha&nbsp; <br /><br />~Just my ghoulish 2 cents.
