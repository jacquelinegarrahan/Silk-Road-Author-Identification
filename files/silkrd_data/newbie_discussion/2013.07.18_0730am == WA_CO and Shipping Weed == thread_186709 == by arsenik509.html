				Now that it is legal to posses and consumer marijuana in these states is it also legal to mail it? That is of course as long as you stay within the amount that you are allowed to posses. I&#039;m thinking it would be grey area considering the USPS is a federal organization and it&#039;s not legal federally. What are your thoughts/insights?

As far as I know it hasn&#039;t come up in any articles I&#039;ve read about it and the like.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would guess, though, that it&#039;s illegal.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my thinking: Medical MJ has been &quot;legal&quot; in CO and CA and a bunch of other states but the feds periodically come and shut down dispensaries because *federally* it is still illegal.&nbsp; The federal law trumps state law.&nbsp; Obviously many dispensaries still operate and it&#039;s not like the fed shuts down every new one that pops up.&nbsp; But I lived in CO when medical marijuana got passed a couple years ago.&nbsp; Back then there were so many dispensaries that a few cities had to ban new ones from opening because it was literally taking too much of a slice out of the total economy.&nbsp; Today, there are very few in comparison.&nbsp; Some of this is because the shittier ones went out of business since the bigger ones could sell at more competitive prices, etc.&nbsp; But a lot of this is the feds coming in and shutting them down, because, again, it is still not legally by federal law and federal law trumps state law.<br /><br />The other half of my argument is that the USPS is a federal institution.&nbsp; So, I&#039;d guess that they follow national, federally-based legal protocols.&nbsp; So: I&#039;ve been in bars in Durango where people are literally taking bong-rips at a bar stool, and also see a ton of people lighting up in plain sight in downtown Denver.&nbsp; But regardless of how lax the local/state LEOs are about it, the USPS, because it is a federally run institution, likely ignores the state laws.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about UPS/FedEx/DHL/etc. but my hunch is they would also follow federal shipping laws and regulations.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really basing this on anything other than my gut feeling and the point about USPS being federal - but having lived a good chunk of my life in CO even with my smoker friends (I quit a few years ago) I never hear of anyone mailing it.&nbsp; People just know a dealer like anywhere else.

				The main reason I ask is because I live in one of those states. I also know there are vendors from those states. Yes I know people I can get it from here and there will be businesses that sell it too soon, but it&#039;s just like Amazon. Sometimes it&#039;s just easier/better to buy online.

				I visited those states recently, and you can just lookup &quot;caregiver&quot; on craigslist, and easily find someone who will deliver you weed as long as you have a 21 ID. :)

				Marijuana is still federally illegal.&nbsp; It is definitely illegal to mail using USPS.&nbsp; USPS mail is federal.&nbsp; It would be against the policy of a private shipping company.&nbsp; Marijuana is a schedule one controlled substance under federal law.
