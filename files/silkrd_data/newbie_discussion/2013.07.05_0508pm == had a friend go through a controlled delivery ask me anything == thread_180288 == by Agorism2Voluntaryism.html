				had him sign for it but he was sleeping so his roommate signed for it then a RFID chip inside 3 minutes later feds kicked down the door customs confused the compound thinking it was meth when it was legal<br /><br />the warrent stated only after the package was opened on location<br />&nbsp;and had to be in the day time and was active for 2 days <br /><br />so if u get a package that was stuck at customs wait 2 days&nbsp; and do it after midnight <br />and do it elsewhere as an extra precaution<br />i checked the discovery packet of his<br />a custody break helped him out alot<br /><br /><br />he did get state time though 6-9 months i believe<br /><br />

				he ordered a few things and hustled a bit of RC&#039;s but nothing illegal&nbsp; in the discovery their was no investigation into him they discovered the package on day 1 and on day 3 they had him in custody <br />it was suppose to arrive but dident the dude even called DHL said they dident know where it was <br />next day he checks still says inbound into customs or clearance delay one or the other but the package still arrived but it was a federal agent dressed as a delivery man<br /><br /><br />so even with no prior investigation overseas is scary! anything thats a amp like substance stay away from because if they test it u can get in trouble for meth as they did a roadside test it seems<br /><br /><br /><br />also it was under 200grams but them thinking it was meth was probably the reason they stopped it<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />we still joke when agents gave a a bunch of drugs to the wrong people haha(custody break)<br /><br />sorry for the misspellings i ate a few 2 many etiaam haha

				OK, so let me speak for the masses.<br /><br />No questions. Don&#039;t think much of your story, not going to send you any bread. <br /><br />Slightly amusing how quickly you dialed down the urgency from OVERLOOK THIS THREAD AT YOUR PERIL!!!1!!1!! to I&#039;m Only Trying To Hit 50 Posts So I Can Irritate The Shit Out Of Even More People.

				OP, if somebody is posting spam that&#039;s obviously going to need to be deleted it usually a good idea to not quote it. You should delete your post so that when mods go through and remove all the infowars posts those people&#039;s information won&#039;t be up anymore, or at least edit out the quote. <br /><br />Yeah, infowars is a dick.

				look up anticipatory search warrents and also look up nighttime warrents <br /><br />the CD goes off as soon as you open the package it looked like a pizza top box he described with a flashing light <br /><br />

				That&#039;s why you never sign for shit, don&#039;t even be close to your house whenever the mail kat comes, and never open your letters at home, drive by your box, pick it up, drive away, don&#039;t come home with the mail,&nbsp; <br /><br />remember to have a marker so you can start writing return to sender before you open it,<br /><br />these are just a few steps i like to take, <br /><br />have a bucket with some kinds of acid that will destroy evidence in a sec&#039;, and for god&#039;s sake, don&#039;t be near your computer or admit you own one if you get caught,
