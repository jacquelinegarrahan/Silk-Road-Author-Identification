				As title says I&#039;m wondering what to try 1st Ketamine or dmt? Thanks in advance for your opinions<br />Its more of a pain relief than getting off or outa it, but that&#039;s a bonus I suppose, spec when freaking pains r bad<br /><br />I have pain problems 24/7 as I&#039;ve ripped all nerves in back and neck; so I&#039;m prescribed Oxy as my strongest painkiller, I&#039;ve refused all the rest as all are poisons&nbsp; ;)<br />Guess I&#039;m tired of the old Oxy now, as I prob can take my full prescription without much of a hit, so time to find something new<br /><br />I&#039;ve read Ketamine is a good painkiller in small bumps, haven&#039;t read up much on dmt, but will; as always educate yrself with what your putting inside yr body :D<br /><br />I like the euphoric feelings Oxy initially give me more than say an acid type totally off it hallucinogenics, but this in a couple of hours time period would be fine<br /><br />I need always to be in control as when off it and I forget about my pain crap, shite can hit the fan big style, even if I just stand up 2 fast, <br />lol funny &amp; I&#039;m smiling when I type this, but believe not in practice :&#039;(<br /><br />I have a few coins so might even go for the 2, the only thing is; I do remember that 1 of these is not 2 good for the kidneys if took to often, or with booze or... something like that, lol<br />so prob best sticking with 1 for now, I&#039;m a thinking<br /><br />again thx in advance <br />the knowledge on this forum is awesome&nbsp; :-*

				DMT is fine fer your kidneys, not much of a painkiller though, still an extraordinary substance, I&#039;d suggest it to most anyone. You probably won&#039;t feel pain while under the influence, as you probably won&#039;t feel much.<br /><br />Never tried ketamine so I can&#039;t say

				My vote goes to ketamine, DMT has no painkilling properties as far as I know. Just make sure you keep the bumps small and give enough time in between them so you don&#039;t get too fucked up.

				Ketamine all the way dude. DMT is more of a &#039;trip&#039;, like shrooms or sid, but not really. Anyways, if pain is what your trying to eleviate, I would go with K because your brain and body actually feel like theyre seperate from each other, i found this to help with my pain, but sometimes hard to function if you do too much K.<br />Kitty also lasts longer than DMT, and DMT is a STRONG hallucinogen, so if you dont have experience with phycadelics, tread carefully.<br />You were right about kitty being harmful to your liver, but thats only if your doing huge quantities, or combining alcohol with it. Saw a segment on DRUGS INC. - Nat Geo, and this guy was doing nearly 2 g a day and his liver was all fucked up, pissing out blood and stuff. <br />So just stick with small bumps till you figure out what works for you :) <br />All the best to you and hope you feel better<br />Shades

				Subtickle or K Queen are definitely good, also Marcel Ketman<br />I think sub deals primarily in racemic, which is a little less intense. <br /><br />I have yet to cross a bad K vendor though.

				I would get the ket, it is really unique in that the effects are widely varied depending on dose, with regular small bumps, its an energetic light feeling, with heavier doses it becomes more sedative, and into the higher doses you can khole yourself and its akin to a &#039;trip&#039; but more of an inwardly focuses trip, when I khole it feels like im in my own little bubble watching the world from an egoless perspective. Fun chemical, it is addictive though, so be aware of the slide into dependance.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;DMT&#039;s&nbsp; boring, lasts for like 20 minutes, tastes like burning plastic. Ketamine is amazing. It&#039;s an anaesthetic, an anti-depressant, a dissociative, anti-anxiety drug with these crazy body loads. When you take enough it produces amazingly intense psychedelic experiences that are pretty unique, as when you&#039;ve gone that deep you are slumped, unable to move, at times totally removed from your &quot;self&quot; as a consistent identity, just experiencing psychic manifestations. Holeing away into other dimensions of the mind is pretty fucking full on.

				Never tried DMT myself but as far as I know it does not have any pain killing properties like what others have been saying. I&#039;d love to try it thought one day. As for ketamine, as long as you don&#039;t over do it, its quite helpful but does not last that long. I&#039;ve used it for depression at times.

				Another vote for Ket. If you have pain it&#039;s a lovely anaesthetic. DMT is also wonderful tho.. But i&#039;d still go the K first if it were me.

				DMT was one of those things I tried a couple times but honestly wasnt all that great. Just remember sounds and what not being extremely vivid. Ketamine from previous experience was a horrible experience both times I tried it. Just remember laying on the floor waiting for it to pass. My vote is neither but ket would be my choice for pain killer if i did have to choose.
