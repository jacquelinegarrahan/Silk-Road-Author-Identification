				&nbsp;:( Hello, trying to put this all together, but have questions.&nbsp; I need steps in laymen s terms. Do I have to download thunderbird to use S.R. or can I just register a Tormail account?&nbsp; &nbsp; Is there any other anonymous mail server besides Tormail?&nbsp; I cannot register an account because I just get a &quot;fatal error&quot; message.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to fire too many questions out at once, but want to complete each step before proceeding to &quot;where I download a PGP for non-computer savvy people&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for any help.

				I love your handle. How do you remember that? :)<br /><br />Firstly everything you need to know is all here. You just need some read-time.<br /><br />I would go with somthing &quot;off the shelf&quot; if I were starting out again. Like TAILS, for instance, has almost all you need.<br /><br />You can change later.

				You don&#039;t need thunderbird and can login to your tormail through TorBrowser (probably safer), but tormail is down and has been for several days. I have been considering hushmail or s-mail, but don&#039;t really know anything about them, I just searched &#039;secure email&#039; today to organise a backup for tormail.... else, I may create a new email with someone common with fake details and simply manually encrypt all my mail with PGP... It&#039;s much more important to get PGP right, so I would research that first...

				Hushmail has a bit of a history, use with care.<br /><br />You should be able to use the same platform that brought you here to access SR....?<br /><br />I&#039;m missing something.....time for a cone<br /><br />

				Get a USB drive with a couple of gigs. Figure out how to get TAILS running on it. Boot to your TAILS USB drive and use its keyring and PGP tools. Don&#039;t worry about Tormail so much. You could create any email account anywhere and as long as you&#039;re not storing personally identifiable information on your account, you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />-CC

				Back when I started on SR I had some good advice from Astor.... to use gpg4USB.&nbsp; Is this information still regarded as good or is there something better to use?&nbsp; It is extremely simple to download and use.&nbsp; Any information you would need is right there in the tools section....<br /><br />As far as encryption goes you dont even need a key if you are not RECEIVING messages.&nbsp; You just need the vendors public key to send your encrypted drop address to them...<br /><br />And that is 50 folks... don&#039;t really see why people spam the list just to get to 50.&nbsp; Is what you have to say in the other forums REALLY that important?<br /><br />Eat some acid folks.... it&#039;s good for ya!<br /><br />mm

				&nbsp;Tormail is back up! I just checked it again today and its working fine. Go make your TM account.<br /><br />As for learning PGP and even tormail. There are some decent tutorials on youtube. The guy who does the pgp tutorial. uses a public key from SR, and he says &quot;I don&#039;t know here I got this and I&#039;m not going to say&quot; He hides the window, but from the small part that you can see around the public key block of some seller you can totally tell is SR.
