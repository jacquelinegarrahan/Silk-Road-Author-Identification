				Looks like very good communication on the Vendor&#039;s part. Shit happens, and when someone is willing to own up to it with no bullshit is commendable.

				Hello all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I just wanted to come here and let everyone that is considering ordering from and using BMG as a vendor to just DO IT~! He is a perfect vendor for LEGIT first time customers. As a new user i had alot of questions (yes i did read all the how to&#039;s and all) especially since my first order was over $400. BMG was nothing but Kind, Patient with my dumb questions, made me feel extremely confident in using this vendor. The Package arrived in a timely manner (5 days from order to receive) even though it was placed on a Friday evening. BMG has gained a loyal customer (ME) for as long as the SR is around. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I could write all day about how please i was with communication, Stealth, His patience, and keep in mind this was my first purchase on the road. He did not ask for FE, When i Asked him about a second order he was COMPLETELY honest.. i will copy my message and his response so you can see<br /><br />my questions:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.Which day was it sent on so i may have an idea of when to expect it. i was hoping it&#039;d show today but unfortunately not. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. &quot;Is it bad practice to place a 2nd order before the 1st has arrived without finalizing the first? (should i wait till 1st is finalized)&quot;<br /><br />His response :&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Never feel sorry for asking anything! appreciate you and your patience. your package should be there no later then tomorrow. If it is not we will send you the tracking number! the usps takes forever sometimes and if i were you i would wait to place any orders before you receive your first one so that you know your package was not seized, the vendor isnt a scammer and that you got exactly what you paid for. Ty for your business and please let us know when you receive your package!<br />BMG<br /><br />Bottom line, BMG is a very HONEST, very Polite &amp; Professional, An excellent vendor, but more importantly.. I think he is a very nice person.<br /><br />Thanks all for reading and BMG, Thank you for everything.. You&#039;ve earned a new loyal customer that will be your customer for as long as you are around.. THANK YOU for your services and now i can play around with my two year old daughter and not be bedridden in pain afterward.. thank you again<br /><br />Jamin
