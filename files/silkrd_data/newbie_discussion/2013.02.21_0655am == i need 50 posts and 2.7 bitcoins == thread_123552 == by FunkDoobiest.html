				Hey there all my fellow travelers of SR:) I am brand new to the road and created my account because i am on the hunt for real mdma/mda. I have never rolled before and am almost 28. I can&#039;t find the real deal around where I live, I have been looking for two years,Only shitty meph where IM at. I can&#039;t wait to have my first roll. I actually lay awake at night and imagine it lol.&nbsp; So IM trying to get 50 posts and 2.7 btc. If anyone has any spare bitcoins and would send them my way I would love you sooo much. I don&#039;t have a way of getting any myself right now.. I&#039;ve seen other people get helped out in this manner before and thought &quot;how awesome are those people.&quot;&nbsp; So who wants to help me pop my SR cherry and my MDMA cherry&nbsp; all at once? ;) Please and&nbsp; THANK YOU to everyone!&nbsp; Oh and feel free to leave me any tips as to what vendor is good for US domestic. I was thinking LIF&#039;s MDA possibly for my first timetime. Suggestions welcome, and please no posts telling me I should buy my own bitcoins, or anything negative. I am serious when I say I can&#039;t get my own right now. Just looking for a little love :) we all need a Lil help sometimes. <br /><br />ONE<br /><br />

				That&#039;s fine. I know what your implying with all the &quot; Lols&quot; you may think that everyone is out to get someone or looking for the next big score, but that&#039;s not always the case.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s tough for ya but have a little faith in humanity. You don&#039;t know my situation, you shouldn&#039;t just assume thinngs. Just for your info I live in a very rural part of northern Michigan. I don&#039;t have a debit card and the closet store is almost 45 miles away. I don&#039;t even know where I could but a green for card up here.....as for your comment about me saying I was a girl,i didn&#039;t even mean it like that. It&#039;s just an expression. Geeze

				i guess i just think if that&#039;s your situation, you have better things to do than bummin&#039; for bitcoins. although i guess if you&#039;re from michigan it is in the wee hours of the morning right now.

				The best compensation I could offer is a couple grams of some OG Kush that I have. It&#039;s dense nugs with lots of nice trics. Better than the weed I see on SR, thats for sure. Also, I have 5 20mg adderall&nbsp; IR I could throw in.

				I know 2.7 is a lot, but not of it&#039;s contributed by say, 5 or 6 different people. I just wanna try real MDA or Mdma, IM desperate lol (obviously). There&#039;s generous people out there, I know it.

				hey guys, I&#039;m a girl, but that has nothing to do with what I&#039;m asking for.&nbsp; I live in rural Michigan as well, like FunkDoobiest.&nbsp; If anyone can help me with 1.5 bitcoin, after I gave 1.2 bitcoin to FunkDoobiest, I realized I gave her bitcoin I didn&#039;t have.&nbsp; I&#039;d really appreciate it, and what goes around comes around.&nbsp; I&#039;m 1st on SR as well, if you care.<br /><br />Thanks guys!

				Let me clarify. I was never trying to use pics of my tits to trade for bit coins. That was just a previous posters&nbsp; idea of being funny. Yes I am a girl, not like it matters, and yes the closest store to me is 45 min and Closest bank is one hour. I live in a small village in the upper peninsula. We do have a small market for food and stuff but they don&#039;t do money transfers there. When I say a small store I mean like the size of&nbsp; a gas station. We deal with cash in town. The bank is too far and inconvenient. That&#039;s why I don&#039;t have a active debit card.&nbsp; I want to try Molly so bad that it&#039;s resorted to begging for btc on here to get a little bit. I&#039;ve always wanted go try it and now IM only 1.3 bit coins away. The first 1.4 got donated almost right after I startedthis thread by two very nice people, but this last 1.3 isn&#039;t coming in so easy lol
