				Half of the time I can&#039;t tell if what I&#039;m reading is real or just some garbage from another drooling moron...I&#039;m no scientist...and I&#039;m not afraid to ask for help, which this is me asking for help. Also, knowing what I need help with, that is a problem. I do not know where to begin.

				Ummm...I guess knowing the very basic and proper procedure...I&#039;m quite flaky so it is very slow and frustrating to be technical. Also it&#039;s 7am and I&#039;m having trouble with pgp lol.

				Always err on the side of it being garbage from a drooling moron. Remember to bear in mind that you do not know who you are dealing with and that the most successful con artists/scammers are the very plausible ones. Those that you think are absolutely genuine. Take every post with a healthy grain of salt. Stay as safe as you can. Never FE.&nbsp; You will get bored with reading that if you are not already. The reason that it&#039;s repeated so often is that it&#039;s true. Otherwise, have fun!(isn&#039;t that why we are here?)

				You guys are already helping a lot, I am bored of reading it and you are right, the ones that seem the most legit are trying to hard...I don&#039;t really even know what I want to have fun with either yet. It&#039;s like jumping in a pool I guess...I&#039;m sure it will be nice once I&#039;m in it, but I know it&#039;s going to be a shock, or at least I believe it should be...I&#039;m still in awe of tor...and it&#039;s been weeks since I discovered it...It made me realize how little I know and that I need help if I&#039;m ever going to make it.
