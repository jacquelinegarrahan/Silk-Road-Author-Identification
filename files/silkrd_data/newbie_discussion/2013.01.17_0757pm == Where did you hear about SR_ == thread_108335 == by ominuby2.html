				I heard about it first from listening to NPR-- National Public Radio!&nbsp; <br /><br />I was listening to it on the drive home from work and heard a news story about this website selling dangerous drugs anonymously.&nbsp; I was like, &quot;F*K YEAH!!!&quot;&nbsp; A little probing online yielded info about bitcoins, and the rest is history.<br /><br />There&#039;s an old thread on the non-newbie forums for this, but I&#039;ll bet there are others with interesting stories, and it&#039;s more interesting than cheating to get the post count up.

				Heard about it while just reading tech sites. Either that or while trying to figure out what the hell this TOR thing people were talking about was. Took me a little while to figure out the whole bitcoin thing too. Pretty fun process though, like a puzzle... for drugs!

				I first heard of silk road through a Research Chemical discussion forum. Someone was kind enough to share some info. I have yet to place my first order. I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of pgp, bitcoin, shipping/recieving, etc amd also have a little forum presence. Hopefully I will eventually become a vendor.

				While I&#039;m not a redditor with an actual account, I read r/drugs and other drug related sub reddits. I don&#039;t really participate in discussions but it was there that I was linked to an article. Probably the same gawker article people mentioned. That was over a year ago when i first heard about SR but I hadn&#039;t been curious enough to explore all of this until a couple of months ago.

				Besides from the obvious fake posts I&#039;m surprised to see how easily people found out about this on the internet and this site is still running no problem. Damn these guys are good! I myself was invited by my friends to come crash over by them for a week to trip. I eventually asked how he got a hold of it when he hadn&#039;t know where to find any in a while. He eventually told me about this site and he showed me it and now I just can&#039;t stop searching. Can&#039;t wait to make my first buy! Also he said you have to wait about a month before you can purchase anything. Is that really true or was he just having problems? I really don&#039;t want to have to wait a month before I start buying stuff... That&#039;s way too long to have to wait to start splurging on all this amazingness.

				I don&#039;t remember when, but I was at the after... after... after party and we were talking about things, I mentioned TOR and they mentioned SR. Shortly after that, I got trapped in something I was told was a relationship, but I&#039;m holding that the jury is out on that. In any case, that reduced my personal privacy enough to restrict my avenues of self fulfillment, and I just paid attention to SR for a while but didn&#039;t really participate. Now I am free, and I like it here.
