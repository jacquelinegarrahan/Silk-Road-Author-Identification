				Still a nub here, and it&#039;s driving me nuts. (so also consider this a spam opportunity to reach 50)....<br /><br />I&#039;m sitting on a total of 9 different orders, since Tuesday. (1 on Tuesday, 3 or 4 yesterday, and the remainder today).&nbsp; All still processing.&nbsp; To make matters worse, I&#039;ve sent numerous emails out since Tuesday to 2 of the vendors, and no one has replied yet... Even though they last visited &quot;Today&quot; each day since.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just order anxiety... about 67 Btc&#039;s worth of anxiety.<br /><br />This is going to be a rough few weeks while I wait for the impending packages. lol<br /><br />Tell me it&#039;s all going to be fine?&nbsp; ???

				Just becasue a vendor has been on doesnt mean he/she had time to read your message. So they may not be ignoring you. You can see if they have read your message or not by looking in your sent folder.

				You are correct... <br /><br />The dude from Tuesday is the only one who hasn&#039;t read any messages.... A new vendor, with only 14 or so sales.&nbsp; I am getting nervous... lol<br /><br />It&#039;s friday... nothing marked in transit yet. :(<br /><br />The waiting game sucks...

				Alright let me put it this way...<br /><br />How much time would you consider too long between time of Order and marked in transit?<br /><br />How much time would you consider too long between messages and reply?<br /><br />It&#039;s now friday, and I have not got a reply (Let alone the fact my message wasn&#039;t even read) since tuesday?&nbsp; That&#039;s just to long for me.&nbsp; And if the item isn&#039;t marked in transit by the end of today, That will also be to long. :(<br /><br />How many days before I should just pull the plug on that particular order?<br /><br />(I know.. lots of questions..)
