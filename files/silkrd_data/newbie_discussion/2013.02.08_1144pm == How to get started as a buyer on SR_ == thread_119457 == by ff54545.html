				Hey guys, I&#039;m new here.<br />I want to start as a buyer on SR and possibly a vendor in the future.<br />I&#039;ve found lots of products that I&#039;m interested, but I have no Bitcoins.<br />Can someone point me in the proper direction to apprehend some of these?<br />

				BitInstant -&gt; MtGox is the way I go.&nbsp; &nbsp;BitInstant lets you deposit from any Moneygram location and they are everywhere, 7-11s, Albertsons, WalMart, Liquor Stores, etc.

				to get bitcoins you should open a mt gox account.&nbsp; Then go to bitinstant.com and enter your user name in the account # field.&nbsp; Then go to cvs or wherever you choose and tell them you want to do moneygram billpay.&nbsp; Easy as pie! and, bitcoins are a good investment.&nbsp; A few months ago 1 btc was $10, now they are like $21.&nbsp; That outplays the dow jones for sure lol

				@**********ff54545**********<br />It hasn&#039;t been mentioned and I don&#039;t know how new you are. The way to get started if you are brand new is to read as much as you can in the forums, and read the wiki, and READ the administrator, DPR&#039;s buyers guide, crucial information. And, probally most importantly, if you havn&#039;t already learned to use GPG and USE it, it is imperative to protect everyone&#039;s anonymity! The GPG4USB is by far the way easier program to use. I experimented with both for days and 4USB leaves the other in the dust. For bitcoins, if you are in the USA, Blue Sky Traders had my bitcoins deposited in my account in 45 minutes after I made a bank deposit in their account. I was blown away buy the speed. Most people won&#039;t deal with you unless you use a gpg encrypted program for communication. Good Luck, SunQueen, oh yes there is a very easy tutorial available here that makes 4USB simple to follow and get going you can print it out. If you want the link, let me know, or any questions. GoodLuck, SQ

				Is it a problem that MtGox asks you to provide them with a photocopy of a piece of identity nowadays? <br /><br />I used to use mtgox a few months ago and they never asked for such documentation. It seems that all the BitCoin exchanges are now asking for proof of ID when setting up new accounts.<br /><br />So is safe to put our real identity on MtGox, and put bitcoins through a bitwasher before transgferring them to MtGox to exchange them for currency?

				**********@KQueen**********<br />There is no way I would show any ID to anyone. I don&#039;t like MT Gox because they are required to track all Silk Road people that do business with them and I have no idea who they report to. Red Flags for me. Are you in the US? Read my above post about Blue Sky Traders, awesome company, and no ID or any personal info is required, just your Silkroad account number for the deposit. I have been with the same bank as BST for many years and to deposit they did not require any ID and they have no idea that I am an actual customer. Made me feel even safer. Good Luck, any questions PM me. SunQueen

				Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate it.<br /><br />I do not use MtGox anymore due to this.&nbsp; I now use BitBargain.co.uk, it is great as it is fast and quick.&nbsp; They do not ask for any information whatsoever.&nbsp; Can you provide me a link to the Blue Sky Traders so that I can have a look.&nbsp; Even though I live in the UK could I still use BST?

				KQueen, I am not sure if they have a Bank over there, you would have to ask. Here is the link:<br />ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It would be faster to email them with the email address they provide. I believe they also post their vendor&#039;s link on that page. They are very nice, too.&nbsp; All the luck, SQ, now to hit the sack, it&#039;s almost 4am Yikes!
