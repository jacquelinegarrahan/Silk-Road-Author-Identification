				Police net $8.2m of drugs sent by mail <br /><br />Twenty people have been arrested and $8.2 million worth of drugs seized in a crackdown on drugs being imported via the international mail system.<br /><br />The joint operation between the Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service netted 18.1 kilograms of illicit drugs including LSD, heroin, steroids, ecstasy, cannabis, methamphetamine and cocaine.<br /><br />More than 2,000 tabs of LSD were seized in Brisbane and Melbourne alone. <br /><br />The operation took place over recent weeks and saw police execute 38 search warrants across five states and the Northern Territory. <br /><br />The drugs were concealed in cushions, a handbag, prints, a jade dragon, cosmetic brushes, birthday cards and other letters and parcels.<br /><br />More than $127,000 in cash was also seized.<br /><br />Customs and Border Protection regional director Graham Krisohos says while most of the seizures were relatively small, they pose a &quot;considerable cumulative threat&quot;.<br /><br />The AFP&#039;s Scott Lee says the seizure will impact drug trade.<br /><br />&quot;These shipments contribute towards supplying the Australian market and exacerbate social problems within Australia associated with drug harm,&quot; he said.<br /><br />The operation focused on Victoria in particular, with more than 14 kilograms of illicit substances seized in that state.<br /><br />From ABC News Tue Mar 26, 2013 11:14am AEDT

				Australia has always had the toughest import customs, the ecosystem can be hurt by the introduction of plant species, diseases, etc...<br />Since it&#039;s an island with a relatively low population the government is able to x-ray every package and utilize sniffer dogs and detection technologies.<br /><br />Hence why people laugh when they hear that the average street price for coke is $250 a gram - and the quality is rubbish.<br />Hence why ETM made a fortune and made off like a coward instead of exiting the game like a real man/woman.

				Never had any trouble myself, must be lucky. I have wondered what it would take to exray every package or letter. Have they the manpower to do that.<br /><br />Saw a customs guy on tv weighing cans of soup etc. a while ago though. They&#039;s a learnin&#039;

				Knew I guy that used to import steroids 15 years ago from all over the world.<br />Most of his stuff got pinched and he got a house visit after quite a few love letters.<br /><br />Maybe stealth letters get though better vials and pills stuffed in electronics and teddy bears but you seem to be doing a lot better than he did.<br /><br />Hope they keep coming through for you brother/sister...<br />
