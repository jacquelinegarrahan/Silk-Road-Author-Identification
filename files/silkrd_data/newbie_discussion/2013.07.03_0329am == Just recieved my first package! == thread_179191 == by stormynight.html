				Man, I&#039;m still trying to overcome BIG hurdle #1: buying fucking bitcoins in Canada where it seems rarer than an honest politician. I&#039;m living vicariously through you peeps that have described your first experiences with getting shit through the mail. I get a rush just at the thought of it.

				Its just a great feeling to get things like this delivered to your house. I dont do a lot of drugs and have therefore no sources in real live. And asking around at parties makes me feel like a complete dickhead and on top of that im tired of buying overpriced lactose and paracetamol tablets :-).<br /><br />blalah... All I wanted to say was: I love SilkRoad! Hope the site will exist forever!

				I&#039;d just like to ask a question to all those who have recently (or in the past) successfully received their first packages...<br /><br />Did you order domestically at the start? Is it common practice to only order domestic until you have built up your stats/become more accustomed to procedures of SR?<br /><br />Are there any success stories ordering internationally at the start?<br /><br />Looking forward to my first purchase but still researching at this stage. <br /><br />Congrats to you!

				Congrats on your first purchase....&nbsp; I said the exact same thing 2 months ago when my first package came.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t believe that SR was actually legit....&nbsp; And truthfully, 2 months and almost $3000 later, I still get that grin every time I open my mailbox and see my envelope of goodies!&nbsp; I too received another package this afternoon, and I had and still have a smile on face....<br /><br />In my opinion, you just can&#039;t beat SR....&nbsp; I know the prices aren&#039;t all that great, but I truly do not mind paying a little extra for the convenience of Anonymity and mailbox delivery.... Truly the best...<br /><br />Thank you and cheers SR!!
