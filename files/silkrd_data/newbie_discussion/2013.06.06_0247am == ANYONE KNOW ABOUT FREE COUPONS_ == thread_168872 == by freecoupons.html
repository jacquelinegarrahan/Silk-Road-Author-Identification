				This would seem like nothing more than a deliberate attack on a vendor, possibly the competition?<br /><br />Before jumping on this please take a moment to ask yourselves what is the motivation behind this persons actions and do I want to be a part of that.

I&#039;ve always been 3 steps ahead of my biggest threat, which makes me on a whole different planet than someone like yourself. <br /><br />Here is what you do man, go out and do something good in the world. Do something nice and help the next man and not because you want anything in return, but because you want to be able to feel good about you and sleep at night and know you aren&#039;t a bad person. Do that, and do it frequently enough, and you just might be ok my dude. <br /><br />For all the wrong I&#039;ve done in my life, I&#039;ll be damned if when I die, I didn&#039;t leave the world a better place.<br /><br />GL

I really don&#039;t know what to say... I worked so hard for that perfect rating! What is it that I have to pay you again to make you disappear? Because the last thing I want is for your to hurt my rating. This would destroy me and I simply could not have that happen. I&#039;ve pitched perfectly and I can&#039;t afford for someone to get on base at this point. I could not bare having my rating destroyed.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll just stop selling, which will stop your army of clones from buying from me in an effort to later destroy me. You could invest $1,000s of dollars and that would crush me. <br /><br />Guess what? I spent more money today with no other purpose than to prevent people like you from existing than you ever asked me for. It was a cost I was happy to bare and will not be passing on to my customers. I learned an incredible amount today and it was worth every cent.... oh please, please masta&#039;, don&#039;t change your ratings on me fo&#039; not paying you for not changing your ratings to a 1 on me!<br /><br />In complete jest, (besides that I really did shell out $70 an hour for professional consultation today, worth every fucking cent.)<br /><br />GL <br /><br /><br />@iLoveTaffy: Man, hold on to those smoothie king coupons for me, those I actually keep and use. I&#039;ll PGP you my address, just don&#039;t toss them out. <br /><br />@M8R-3jt393: Worst case scenario, all my customers will too. Ain&#039;t nobody got time for that shit tho! Who buys from silkroad and gets excited when the mail arrives and there are no drugs in route? This would be a lesson I would teach, if I wasn&#039;t the type of dude who works with his brain and not his back. <br /><br />When you guys hit 50 posts, come visit our community and say hello. Ain&#039;t nothing but love over there on my thread. It&#039;s the closest thing I&#039;ve ever felt to being surrounded by family except for on Christmas and at funerals.

Thank you.<br /><br />With that being said, you would need to remove these links from your thread to genuinely make things right or delete the entire thread. I knew you were coming one day and already had forgiven you long before you ever knew what the Silk Road was. Now I secure things so no one can ever copy cat you, which is 90% finished and links will be restored soon, and then I figure out how the next man is going to come at me next time, and then I patch that vulnerability up too, long before he considers the idea.<br /><br />GL
