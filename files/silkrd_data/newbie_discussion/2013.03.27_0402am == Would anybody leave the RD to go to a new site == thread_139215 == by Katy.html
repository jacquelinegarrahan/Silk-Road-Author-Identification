				Hi I&#039;m new.&nbsp; Would&nbsp; you leave the rd to go to another site.&nbsp; For me noway, the reason for that is, since the time of been here like 3 weeks, first time on the forum, I&nbsp; really llike thew moderators very professional and they know how to talk and solve things.&nbsp; You know in my time that is a very difficult, I hope the moderators are gtetting paid because faceit, if I had that job I would just mess things up.&nbsp; Aslo the RD is established so cuts down on scams alot.&nbsp; The people are awesome and funny and some of these people, I&#039;m in love with, but that will never happen on a site like this.&nbsp; SR is the best site ever.

				I don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever abandon the road unless it became entirely scammers.&nbsp; But I might try a new site out if one popped up that was equally as reputable.&nbsp; There are a couple of private vendors on TOR that are about as reputable and there where at least two other markets that allowed illegal drug sales that I know of, but they both looked and felt kind of shady.

				I enjoyed this place because if I go to any other market, I immediately get the feeling like I just stepped into the wrong back alley.<br /><br />SR is more like a Dutch coffeehouse.

For the products I buy (best left unsaid) SR is overpriced and the quality poor. After five purchases, based on feedback and the forums, four were barely usable. Only one purchase had the quality and price I felt was worthwhile. A good part of the feedback on SR is complete bullshit -- use it with caution. I have to admit the forums are pretty good -- again use with caution. Laplace
