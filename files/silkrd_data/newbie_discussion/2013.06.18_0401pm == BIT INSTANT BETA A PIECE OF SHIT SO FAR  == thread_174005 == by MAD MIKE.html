				Hey man,<br /><br />I had the same stupid problem. Zip zap went fine but bitinstant transaction failed. If you contact customer support they will be helpful and should sort it out. But after working it out they sent my money to the wrong address. Stupid bitinstant. I have been loyal to them but this new site is fucking stupid. <br /><br />I think I will do monekpak of SR for my bitcoins for now. <br />Its sort of a high fee but its ALOT more convenient for me and also completely anonymous and if you&#039;re using someone reputable probably more secure just because you dont have to go through government regulations (ID, tracking money, bitcoin addresses, zip zap and such)<br /><br />A 20 or 15% fee really is not that bad for the privelege of ordering any cheap drug you want to your doorstep. Ive heard some complaining on bitcoin fees but for what you can do with them its well worth it I think. If you buy in bulk and play the market right you could end up saving money. <br /><br /><br />As for your problem, you should click the support page oon bitinstant and explain your problem, they are prompt and relatively helpful so theres a good chance you will still get your coins. I didnt get a refund which suck but I understand why they couldnt. <br />Anyway, good luck m,an<br />

				I think BitInstant is going to lose a lot of customers over this beta. Seems to be nothing but problems. Someone even said they deposited to some BC address different from what was ordered and they were just like &#039;well sorry nothing we can do&#039;.

				15-20% fee, pfff, gtfo with that shit. $1,000 order is $150-$200 extra, it defeats the entire purpose of SR IMO when you&#039;re paying that much extra. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been using Bitinstant for awhile now and it does have its problems, but I ALWAYS get my coins, sometimes slower then I&#039;d like, but it&#039;s still better than a 15-20% fee.<br /><br />

				I think a 15% fee is a very fair trade for complete anonymity and convenience. And if you dont buy in bulk its really not that bad. Considering the glitches new bitinstant has and the whole ID thing, plus the inconvenience of the going to walmart and all the online shit(which is more of a personal thing) I can walk 5 mins to walgreens, buy a moneypak with cash, go home make a 1 step order and get my coins in a couple hours. Then I can sell a gram to a friend and that covers the fee. <br /><br />Its all a matter of personal preference. If you do sell drugs big time you would probably have more resources than most people in terms of getting around regulations and shit if you know what I mean.&nbsp;

				I use coinbase at the moment.&nbsp; You do have to enter your bank information though.&nbsp; I would wire some BTC to a family member from either the UK, Germany or parts of SE Asia.&nbsp; They would then send it through a mixer service for me and send it back to my blockchain account.&nbsp; I&#039;d then use blockchain&#039;s anonymizer to send it to my SR.&nbsp; And SR built in mixer would add another layer of security for me.&nbsp; Paranoid? Yup! Going to jail would be a total buzz kill.

Theres a bunch of different payment options on localbitcoins, some like deposit cash at a bank, or use moneygram like you do with bitinstant but it would go through a different process. Look around for sellers who would do an anonymous bank transfer type deal or if you live in a major city you could easily find someone to give cash too at a meetup at a library and they send you coins from there.

				Blue Sky Traders worked good for me. They say you need at least a $400 trade the first time, but I tried with $!50 and had my bitcoins 6 hours later with a 2.9% fee. It&#039;s completely anonymous if you use a tormail email address.
