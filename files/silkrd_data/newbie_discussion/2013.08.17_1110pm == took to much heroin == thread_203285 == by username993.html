				Hi, I have a little problem, i was chilling with some heroin, and i did some hits(snorting) and now i think i have taken to much, like if i don&#039;t focus i feel like im falling asleep, and if i close my eyes then i fall asleep superfast if i don&#039;t stop me. So i need a way on how to not fell asleep, i also have to manually breath sometimes, because my body does it really slow atm, i don&#039;t think i got so much so if i fall asleep i would die, but if the person i live with finds me, then im straight to the ER and i can&#039;t do that. I know that this is real heroin,(or morphine) i have used the same product before and i tested myself and it said that it was morphine, beucase heroin convers into morfin pretty fast in you body. im trying to drink energydrinks but it don&#039;t help, i just feels like puking. and what i did to stop myself from puking was to take a attarax, and i didn&#039;t think thats also making me sleppy, it might have been like<br />21.00 0,2g/ 22:00 0,05g/ 23:00 0,15g so it was like 0,4 i think, not sure. so what should i do to not fall into sleep? thanks in advance. <br /><br />sry for messy thread hard to type :S

				The sleep that is trying to overtake you is the &quot;nod&quot; . People do H just for that . And the pukey feeling, thats natural too if your not a regular user, some regulars still puke. Your better off not fighting it, go ahead and puke. You will feel better and be able to enjoy the high more.

				You nearly OD on H and you&#039;re worried about a snore?&nbsp; Not everyone is going to snore the same way when they nod off on heroin, you should be okay.&nbsp; If you&#039;re able to continue posting on here and it has been over a few hours (considering you haven&#039;t taken more in the interval), you should be fine to sleep.&nbsp; I really doubt you will snore funny which will cause your parents to wake up their adult son and drag him to the hospital for a naloxone shot or whatever.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why did you try heroin if you already knew what effects it had on your brother and the consequences you&#039;d suffer from your parents if found out?&nbsp; Next time do it at a friend&#039;s house who will remain clean to watch you.&nbsp; <br /><br />-HDs

				If you are posting you are fine. You would not know it if it you and you were going down. You would just slip off. But if you are afraid of falling asleep it is best to keep busy but I would not be posting on a forum especially because in the state you would want to be careful of what you say in that frame of mind. I would walk around the house and definitely get something to eat and drink. Too many people od because they do dope, mix it up with pills like xanax, vicodin, percs, or oxy, and even will have a beer or two. Alcohol really intensifies dope which people think is awesome because they will get more fucked up.<br /><br />I have seen people who have used dope for 15 plus years mix with booze, who totally believe they know their limits and body, slip off and od. Fortunately no one died but one stamp to the next can be of vastly different quality. Even of the same dope one hit to the next even if looks like the same amount. Plus people keep doing it all night trying to chase that high and just pile that shit up in their system. <br /><br />I know I am going on and on here but just trying to watch out for people. Best to be safe.

				Just went back and read that you are worried about your parents rushing you to the hospital because you snored? Maybe I misread something but yo, that&#039;s the funniest/oddest bit I&#039;ve read in a long time. No offense but it sounds like you are too young to be fucking with drugs like dope and not having anyone around to watch for you especially that you are new to using and don&#039;t know limits. Again, no offense but take advice from older cats and go easy. There are too many news stories about young kids - those 21 and under - who od because of irresponsible use.

				This is a funny post, except for that the OP was worried about OD. If you&#039;re typing, and have snorted more than 1/2-1 hour ago, you don&#039;t have any chance of OD. If, within 10-15 minutes you start to feel it coming on really strong you might want to worry a little, but an hour later?<br />Good to be safe rather than sorry, maybe you got a friend for when you next try it? The good thing about opiates is that if you are brought to a hospital in time (still breathing heart beating, etc.) they give you narcan (or narcon or something similar, I think there are a couple different kinds of narcotic antagonist) they&#039;ll IV you with some stuff that will bring you right out of it. In fact if you have a &#039;habit&#039;, and OD, and you&#039;re given a shot of this narcotic antagonist, you&#039;ll practically jump off the table and probably become &#039;dope sick&#039; big time. You&#039;ll go into instant withdrawls. Then because you still have the heroin in your body, the narcan will start to wear off and you&#039;ll start to get high again Don&#039;t know how long&nbsp; this takes, the narcon wearing off, but I know this is what happens. I think you can find &#039;kits&#039; that have narcon in&nbsp; them (anti overdose kits) but I&#039;ve heard about them. <br />That&#039;s why it&#039;s nice to have a &#039;sitter&#039;, who can help if you get into trouble (as long as you don&#039;t BOTH do the dope)<br />Well, I wish that I was first starting to &#039;chip&#039; again (opiate &#039;naive&#039;). It takes quite a bit to get addicted the first time, after that your body changes and it&#039;s a lot easier to get hooked. <br />You got methadone clinics in your area?<br />

				About your &#039;nodding&#039;-don&#039;t drive!! You can&#039;t stop the nodding, although you think you can drive (and can between nods) you&#039;ll be driving and go to sleep for a second, and you won&#039;t know it. You could go off the freeway while on a nod. I tried it once, and it was kinda like waking and knowing you&#039;re driving and then waking and realizing you&#039;ve been out for a second and you&#039;ll drive ok for a while and wham!-you go out for a second and then wake up, realize you&#039;ve been driving, (&#039;rinse and repeat&#039;)<br />If you&#039;re using heavily, you can stay from getting hooked for a long time by taking weeks &#039;off&#039;. Just get high Saturday night (or Saturday) and Sunday, and stay away from it until next Saturday. When you start to wake up feeling tired during the week and wondering why you feel a little crummy, you will know what&#039;s happening. <br />Usually eventually everybody gets addicted, give in and do some dope during the week, and this will turn into a real addiction. As long as you can stay &#039;clean&#039; during the weeks, you can stay away from addiction. I chipped for years (and I was IV using)<br />IV is by far the best (although I&#039;ve never smoked) but you have to worry (if you have a sitter and/or share &#039;works&#039;-rigs, needles) about getting (or giving) a disease to somebody. I used to be really careful about keeping needles seperate (with somebody I was sharing the dope with) then one day, the &#039;sitter&#039; switched needles on me. He did it deliberately because he had hepatitis C, and was a stupid motherfucker (wish I knew HOW stupid he was) and thought that the more people he could infect with hepatitis the faster HE would get cured-can you believe that in the US somebody could be this stupid? So 30 years later I have hepatitis C from somebody I was GIVING dope to, isn&#039;t that a trip?

				Thanks lokiju for your observations about chipping. Makes sense to me.<br />I find that as little as 1/2 of 7.5 hydrocodn sharpens my attention. <br />My mileage is great! Yessir, chippin one piece at a time is the best way to travel.

				A little story:&nbsp; a family member of mine got addicted to heroin, eventually got low on money, and after awhile decided to rob a bank with an airsoft gun.&nbsp; He made his escape and rented a car with his proceeds.&nbsp; He bought an 8-ball and nearly overdosed in the back of the car (heroin depresses the respiratory system).&nbsp; Still on the lam, he decided to turn himself in and ended up serving 7 years in a federal prison where he saw a man get shanked through his throat in the lunch line over a dispute for a cup of coffee.&nbsp; Moral of the story: COFFEE KILLS.&nbsp; &nbsp; P.s. this is a true story, I did not fabricate this. Heroin should be avoided.

				If you&#039;re mixing up a shot and you have a sitter or somebody you&#039;re sharing the dope with, make sure that you do the dividing (you won&#039;t know how much liqued you have until pulling it all up into the rig) with a NEW or cleaned (bleach will kill all germs, if you give the rig or plunger or whatever about 30 seconds to a minute or two) rig. Make sure that NO PART of whatever you&#039;re going to shoot up comes into contact with somebody else&#039;s rig (if it&#039;s not new)<br />Some people are so stupid, especially with heroin or people who shoot up (although I know there&#039;s smart people out there who shoot up, I haven&#039;t met them &#039;on the street&#039;) that they&#039;ll mock you for being so &#039;clean&#039;. Ignore these people. The 2 lasting things that will stay with you forever when you use (whatever-coke, heroin, crank etc.) and FUCK UP are the law (and the conviction) and diseases (AIDS, hepatitis mostly). I did have a girlfriend who had &#039;endocardis&#039; (don&#039;t know how to spell that) that&#039;s an infection that resides in the valves of the heart, where the oxygen is rich, that slowly destroys the heart valves. It&#039;s difficult to get rid off, even with antibiotics because it&#039;s in the heart, it&#039;s a &#039;general&#039; or system infection. Those are the worst and come from introducing germs and viruses into the veins directly (although you also can get general or system infections from &#039;sticks&#039; or accidental small cuts when the germs are present) The other infections are &#039;local&#039; infections, this is like a infection that (usually) comes from a &#039;missed&#039; shot (when you&#039;re aiming for a vein and &#039;miss&#039;) These are like boils or HUGE &#039;pimples&#039; that come at the site on your body where you &#039;missed&#039;. When you see a doctor, the doctor will look at the boil (which just &#039;happens&#039; to be right on top of a vein) and KNOW that you shoot dope (what kind of dope they can&#039;t tell. They always ask though, I always wondered why they ask WHAT DRUG you took. It&#039;s just curiosity, unless it wasn&#039;t-maybe somebody out there KNOWS why the Doc wants to know?) This info YOU DO NOT WANT GETTING INTO YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS, it will interfere with you getting prescribed drugs that they might prescribe to you if they didn&#039;t know that you used illegal drugs. Doctors and nurses (and cops, of course) have a tremendous prejustice against IV (especially) drugs. Of course a doctor (or nurse) can write in your medical records that you &#039;exhibit drug seeking&#039; tendencies too, this is also very bad (and can get you on a &#039;list&#039; in the US that some doctors check before they prescribe anything &#039;good&#039;.)<br />These are a couple of things that I wished that I had avoided years ago, because they have followed me ever since (convictions and hep C)<br />If you stay at home and aren&#039;t &#039;partying&#039; in public, you can reduce your chances of coming to attention of police, this is another &#039;good&#039; habit.

				This young guy may not even know how to jerk off. Maybe since his mommy rushes people to the hospital because they snore she can show him a thing or two about a thing or two. She&#039;s probably really religious and screams Bloody Jesus in bed. Begs forgiveness and all that funky jazz.

				I wish you luck dude, hope your ok.<br /><br />For future reference though, you should never drink energy drinks when you are really trying to stay awake. They will only make you crash and have the shakes while your out. What would god fearing mommy think of that? You should only do this when your parents are not around or you are somewhere else with people you can trust. You probably missed out on a real groovy ride. I&#039;ve only tried a couple times and over 10 years ago. We always did it sitting up on the couch with buckets near by and a designated person to catch and flip us if we fall and run for the bucket if we puked.<br /><br />When doing H and especially experimenting with new things it ALWAYS a good idea to have friends that you trust with your life and trust you the same. <br /><br />Sorry to go mommy on you there, lol. I&#039;ve just seen to many people get really fucked over in the passed.

				I&#039;ve never cared for opiates, I had one experience where we laced a bowl of bud with some pain killers.

				It sounds like you&#039;re worried about sleep apnea.&nbsp; Heroin relaxes the muscles in your body, and sleep apnea occurs when the muscles at the back of your throat relax, obstructing your air passage.&nbsp; When these throat muscles relax, your airway narrows or momentarily closes, cutting off your breathing.&nbsp; This can result in a loud or choking snore.<br /><br />This used to happen to a boyfriend of mine if we would dose shortly before going to bed.&nbsp; The best way I found to prevent it was to use earlier in the night or to definitely sleep on your stomach, it helps.

				I don&#039;t think that apnea is the worry (although relaxation of the neck muscles is a factor worth considering), he is worried because opiates/opioids have the side effect of suppressing respirations. <br />Respiratory arrest is a common risk in the administration of these drugs.<br />However, if he is 2 hours in from administration, he has passed the point of peak drug action, which is usually 60 minutes for oral, or 20 minutes for injection (snorting would be somewhat longer than injection but less than oral).<br /><br />The drug duration is usually 4 to 5 hours.<br /><br />My guess is that he should be fine.

				Knowledge... Knowledge can be a great tool to relive anxiety and keep you alive.<br /><br />You sound opiate naive, which makes me wonder why you would be doing heroin... Take things easier in future for the sake of your body and overprotective parents. <br />And make sure you educate yourself before you touch any drugs in future. Because there&#039;s nothing worse than making an easily avoidable mistake and never having the chance to learn from it.
