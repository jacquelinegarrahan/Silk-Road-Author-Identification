				PGP is way for you to send something, like your address, to someone without a third party being able to read it.&nbsp; The third party being someone intercepting the message through whatever technical means they may have.&nbsp; Anyway you download a program that basically does it all for you, you type in an address, you use the public PGP key provided from whoever, to encrypt what you want to send, it spits out the code, you copy and paste the code and send it on its merry way.&nbsp; Then the person you sent it to uses their private key to decrypt it, so only the person with that special private key can read what you wrote.&nbsp; Look up encrypting with PGP on google im sure some sites will pop up with better tutorials.

There are several tutorials around the forums, I would highly recommend you check out the Newbie PGP club, and feel free to PM me if you have any detailed questions. <br /><br />The PGP club can be found here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=107219.0

				Go on youtube and watch some tutorials, then go on the Security sub-forum and read some tutorials. Don&#039;t be intimidated, PGP is very confusing and daunting at first but, it&#039;s really not that difficult to use and it could very well safe your life.

				PGP is much safer than privnote. No one knows who runs that site and who could possibly be leaking important information like your home address.

				Can someone technically explain how our security can be jeopardized on SR when not using PGP?<br /><br />Or even if you sent a simple email, who from the outside can take a look at it and how as it runs through the different networks?<br /><br />

				You don&#039;t really need to know the specifics on how PGP works, although it definitely wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing to understand if you&#039;ve the time to learn.<br /><br />What PGP does in the case of SR is put your address in code so that only the vendor can read it.&nbsp; This means not even SR admins can see it.&nbsp; So if SR ever got taken control of by LE then they&#039;d not be able to see your address.<br /><br />Unless someone can suggest a reason not to do it this way?? then I&#039;d recommend the following (and do it through your TOR browser).<br />1. Go to https://www.igolder.com/pgp/encryption/<br />2. Copy the PGP public key from your vendors profile and paste in the first section on that website<br />(Copy everything between and including the words &quot;<br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----<br />There will be a whole heap of random characters in here, make sure you copy it all!<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----&nbsp; &quot;)<br />3. Type your address in the second box (have a look in the shipping section of the forums for details on how to format this correctly so it can be read by automatic readers, that way no person has to handle your letter)<br />4. Press Encrypt<br />5. Copy the result and paste into the address section when you place an order<br />6. The vendor will receive the encrypted message, decode it to find your address and send your item<br /><br />Any other questions, just ask, I&#039;ll do my best :)
