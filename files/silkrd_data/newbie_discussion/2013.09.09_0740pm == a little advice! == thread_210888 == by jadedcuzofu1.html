				well i am new here of course, have a couple of issues..first let me explain my situation, pills are my choice of drug 7.5/325 hydros 120 month and soma 350 mg 60 a month..ive been on these meds for a good 6 yrs, UNTIL i go to my regular dr appointment last week he took me off both meds and gave me 60 hydro to &quot;taper&quot; myself off. I have severe back pain sciatic nerve and curvature in my spine and believe my medication improve my quality of life, and yes i love my pills they give me energy and help me do my work everyday :( now comes the difficult part..if im unable to get my pills can anyone tell me a pill i could possible take that will lower my withdrawl symptoms? or point me to a good vendor here with decent medication...also i dont quite get the bitcoin system its highly confusing, do i have to go to moneygram? can i use a prepaid debit card to purchase bitcoins..ive been trying to locate valium off the streets (cause i hear it will help during withdrawls) but of course these are hard to come by as well. any help anyone can give me will be appreciated..looking forward to figuring out how to work this bitcoin thing :) thanks again

				I can&#039;t help you with your drugs question, but I can try with your bitcoin questions. There are a number of methods, but my preferred route is:<br /><br />1) Buy bitcoins from a highly-rated person at www.localbitcoins.com via bank transfer.<br />2) Send the btc to bitcoinfog. They charge 1-3% commission to hide the fact that your btc go to Silk Road, and minimum transfer is 0.2 btc.<br />3) Sent the btc on to silk road (warning, bitcoinfog introduces a 6+ hour delay).<br /><br />EDIT: If you can find someone on localbitcoins who lives near you, then meet in person and buy with cash.

				Greetings ZOFU<br />Life is Pain....sorry for yours.(pain)<br />&quot;if im unable to get my pills can anyone tell me a pill i could possible take that will lower my withdrawl symptoms?&quot;<br />Yes SUBOXIN....but you will have to see a pain management Doctor...not all Docs can prescribe that med.<br />It cancels out withdraw and relieves pain at the same time.Expensive though...and the doc may not take insurance so you pay out of pocket and try to get reimbursed from your ins company.<br />The ingredient in it are ...buprenorphine and naloxin,you could do a search to get it all.<br />Hope this helped.<br />&nbsp; The Traveler

				Damn....Can someone explain to me why I can do any drug on the planet for any amount of time and feel no urge re-dose or get to the point of &quot;have to have it&quot;. <br /><br />People make these posts all the time and I have no sympathy for them. I always assume there is something wrong with them. Lately,&nbsp; thinking there is something wrong with me.WTF?
