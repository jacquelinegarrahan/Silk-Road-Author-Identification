				... What purpose does keeping a &quot;blacklist&quot; serve?<br /><br />If anything, to me it only demonstrates a vendor&#039;s immaturity.<br />But maybe there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing, so that&#039;s why I ask.

				1. you don&#039;t have to remember every ahole who tried to fuck with you.<br />2.you can exchange your BL with others who also keep a BL and make your experience as a vender safer.<br />3. making it public that you have such a thing can be used as a threat to customers who don&#039;t stay in line.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the replies. Certainly interesting. If (though imagine &quot;When&quot; is more apt) I encounter such persons, I&#039;ll most likely keep such a list to myself.<br /><br />Though who knows, maybe it&#039;d be something worth sharing in the elusive Vendor Roundtable. Just a few or a handful of more sales and I should qualify!

				&nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />vendor&#039;s should be blacklisted first and foremost, if your keeping user&#039;s details on a blacklist that is not ethical and bad for everyone including the vendor&#039;s themselves. i wouldn&#039;t deal with a vendor who keeps blacklists, shows their stupidity and immaturity.

				sorry but most vendor&#039;s are also dumber than a dog&#039;s turd. don&#039;t trust them, in fact don&#039;t trust anyone. if they are keeping your details after the order has been completed REPORT THIS TO SR ADMIN it is against the rules of sr.

				&nbsp;jampants don&#039;t give it any thought. The vendors are a great bunch of people and they need a place to vent their frustrations and be elite away from the buyers. It&#039;s a good thing for SR to give them their own club like that. Their round table is a place where they can talk about the buyers who are scamming and buyers who they are willing to sell to with good stats. SR policy prevents them from keeping your sensitive data<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a good thing

				Blacklist doesn&#039;t seem like too powerful a weapon against unsavory buyers because it&#039;s easy to just dump your buying account and open a new one with a different name. You could even send your coins right to your new account. But it&#039;s not likely a vendor who screws up is going to open a new vending account; he&#039;s just going to have to try to make up for it by working extra hard. Unless of course he just gets outright banned by SR admin, but that would only be in the case of gross transgressions.
