				I&#039;ve been looking around trying to find ways to make bitcoins. I&#039;ve got little money. Only thing I have to provide is my music. I figure if I post my music and offer to send the complete file to whoever wants to send me .02 bitcoin, maybe I can get a little something in my wallet.<br /><br />This is&nbsp; the best album I&#039;ve ever done and it&#039;s mostly piano music and other instruments, even drums. I wrote it all over a few months of time and put alotta work into it. <br /><br />The whole piano album is a lil over 30 minutes long. <br /><br />Message me at x if interested. Thanks. If you want to leave a reply saying I&#039;m pathetic asking for bitcoins like this, you can do so. I will consider it entertainment.

				I&#039;m not on a system that can stream etc right now, so I can&#039;t speak for the music.<br /><br />However, if you&#039;re poor like a lot of people are right now, then there are a few other ways you can get small amounts of BC for free too. I won&#039;t link anything etc so I&#039;m not digging for referrals here, but if you look/ask around there are some free lotteries (for like 0.0010 wins) that you can just loop with a bot etc daily on a spare PC. Also there are some ways to get small paypal deposits online on normal-web (surveys, referrals etc) that you could use to get tax-free small income for BC use.<br /><br />MUSIC: Try Jamendo (normal-web site), it&#039;s full of artists uploading music either under Creative Commons or as purchases for people to buy the rights to DJ it or use it in media such as documentaries or college projects etc.

				I&#039;ve tried all the bitcoin faucets. And I did the math. Even I participate in them every 30 minutes for 8 hours a day, I&#039;ll only make 4 pennies a month, lol.

				I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s a link to your personal youtube account?<br /><br />You haven&#039;t declared that you intend to do anything illegal (yet) but I&#039;d try and stay a little more anonymous.<br /><br />As for bitcoin if you are female and reasonably good looking there is chateaux de crypto and girlsgonebitcoin on reddit, you can prostitute yourself there.<br /><br />

You want your SR buyer account to have a different name to this one too and have original passwords. <br /><br />As you are not female I imagine you&#039;ve looked at the above subreddits and decided to stick with normal pron.<br /><br />Good luck.
