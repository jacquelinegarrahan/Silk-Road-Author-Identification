				So i placed an order (2 orders actually) from a seller last saturday which was marked as in transit sunday/monday. 1 part of the order arrived on wednesday (3.5g of green) and the 2nd part (1g of another strain)&nbsp; has yet to show up. The package that arrived on wednesday was very stealthily done, with professional looking printed labels. But one thing that caught&nbsp; my attention, and has since been eating away at me since using the product...there is a USPS tracking number sticker as well as a postage sticker on the front of the package. The postage sticker has the date it arrived, zip code and the name of my town on it. As if the postage was paid for at my post office, while the senders address is on the other side of the country. The postage amount on the sticker is $0.00, but there are also 3 regular postage stamps on the envelope as well, with an ink stamp on them signifying wednesday&#039;s date as well as my town. I checked the tracking number online, and all it says is that there was an acceptance scan at 10:30am wednesday morning, usually the time my post office begins processing packages. <br /><br />Is this weird? Does what i said make any sense? I received another package the same day from a different seller that had nothing odd on it, as well as 4 or 5 other packages from amazon/ebay purchases. Any help or input would be appreciated, i just can&#039;t figure out why this would happen.
