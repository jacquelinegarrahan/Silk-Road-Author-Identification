				&nbsp;The original Nichols paper on LSZ(SS-2c), is on erowid, but it isn&#039;t really very valuable without a frame of reference.&nbsp; It is a potent 5HT1a agonist, unlike LSD which is a 5HT1b agonist,&nbsp; there is data<br />integrated from the original paper compared to other psychs at:<br />http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2814854/&nbsp; (clearnet) <br />there are 42 drugs profiled at that site.&nbsp; One interesting thing to note, is that LSZ is a potent agonist at<br />3 or 4 HT receptors, while LSD is potent at 7-9 receptors at equivalent levels, I&#039;ll display the <br />computed values, these are values based upon order of intensity, with 4 being the highest.&nbsp; <br />each drop in 1 number(ie. 4-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;) is at least a 10-fold decrease, because it is based upon<br />a log graph of intensity at each receptor.<br />SS-2c: 4.00 5ht1a, 3.22 5ht1b, 2.82 D3, 2.45 5ht7, 2.44 5ht6, 2.32 5ht2a, 2.17 5ht5a, 2.17 5ht2b, 2.03 5ht2c, 1.74 D2, 1.72 Beta1, 1.62 D4, 1.16 5ht1e, 1.14 D1, 1.00 D5, 0.67 Alpha1A, 0.57 Beta2, 0.20 H1<br />compare this to the original:<br />LSD: 4.00 5ht1b, 3.77 5ht7, 3.75 5ht6, 3.73 5ht1a, 3.70 5ht1d, 3.64 5ht5a, 3.54 5ht2a, 3.16 D3, 3.11 5ht2b, 3.11 5ht2c, 2.93 Alpha2A, 2.62 5ht1e, 2.55 D2, 2.39 D4, 2.34 D1, 2.05 D5, 1.54 Alpha1A, 1.40 H1, 1.39 Beta1, 1.05 Beta2, 0.65<br />and Good &#039;ol Shrooms! <br />Psilocin: 4.00 5ht2b, 3.40 5ht1d, 3.37 D1, 3.03 5ht1e, 2.88 5ht1a, 2.83 5ht5a, 2.82 5ht7, 2.82 5ht6, 2.67 D3, 2.52 5ht2c, 2.19 5ht1b, 2.14 5ht2a, 1.77 Imidazoline1, 1.74 SERT, 1.57 Alpha2B, 1.36 Alpha2A, 1.03 Alpha2C<br />&nbsp; You can see here that it is in some respects similar to both, yet different.<br />I have tried the compound at 75ug, it is definitely active, but an associate of mine took a larger<br />dose with an SSRI and had problems with nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; The same subject had no adverse response to AL-LAD or LSD.&nbsp; I suspect that the decreased breadth of activity makes this compound not as easily tolerated as LSD, although it does seem very promising.&nbsp; I had good visuals and low body load at 75ug, but I have not seen very many reports, only 3 or 4 with low dosage and one with high dosage. <br />

				It&#039;s another one of the new, relatively crappy (in comparison to Psilocybin or a better LSD-type substance) RC that&#039;s available extremely cheap in bulk and has just been hyped up on the &quot;darknet&quot; as something special to justify the insanely high mark-up. <br /><br />Spoiler: You can buy AL-LAD, LSZ, and countless other &quot;special&quot; blotter-laid psychadelics using Google and about 100ug of common sense.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t see it being any cheaper on the clearnet.&nbsp; Frankly, I wouldn&#039;t buy it on the clearnet, for the same reason I don&#039;t buy san pedro or salvia online.&nbsp; No offense to RC dealers, but they&#039;ll give up their list to the feds faster than you can order.&nbsp; Not talking about SR, just clearnet RC sites sometimes keep records, which is why they won&#039;t ship sometimes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also heard of RC dealers doing all kinds of activity that would get them banned on SR, but they know that they can&#039;t pull that shtii here, without ruining your rating.&nbsp; I think one of the &quot;-escaline&quot; dealers on SR lost my trust when they said they wouldn&#039;t ship to my area, along with several others involved in the &quot;Bath Salt Ban&quot;.&nbsp; This is an illegal darknet site, local laws shoudln&#039;t fucking matter, lolz...&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen any posts anywhere saying &quot;oh, yeah, I brought that shit to a party, and people went fucking nuts for it.&quot;&nbsp; not that I don&#039;t appreciate new stuff, just if people would speak up and talk about it more, they might save some people the trouble of figuring it out themselves.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thousands of doses sold, and 3 reports on erowid, the LSZ that is.&nbsp; AL-LAD is fucking brilliant.&nbsp; LSZ is a decent drug, if you are a &#039;true believer&#039; in LSD and shrooms, its worth doing if you can physically handle it, I&#039;m not saying it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; I won&#039;t do 25I or 2Cs, I want to try TMA-2, but it only ships from spain, and isn&#039;t always &#039;in season&#039;.&nbsp; Spain/Europe on SR is the place to get the good psychs, not RC sites.

				LSD, Mescaline, Psilocybin<br /><br />These three are all you need IMO everything else is not as good for one reason or another. Between these three there is an amazing range of length, intensity, and &quot;type&quot; or &quot;feel&quot; to the trip. The problem is, they are all illegal. <br /><br />Safest one to procure IMO would be Mescaline which you can order online from Peru. You can order the dried green cactus chips from a Peruvian Torch or San Pedro cactus. You can easily grind this, mix some water to make nasty little dough-like cactus balls, and eat them with gatorade chaser. Or, if you are so inclined, you can do a fairly simple A-B extraction to get all the way or at least part of the way to pure Mescaline. All of this info is readily available.<br /><br />The newest RC that looks promising to me is 6-APB but the prices are too high and/or I can&#039;t find a reliable source. Technically I believe its still legal in the U.S.A. at least. <br /><br />All of this is strictly my opinion and understand that my bias towards psychedilics is of a spiritual nature and less of a party-nature.<br /><br />In regards to OP: LSZ doesn&#039;t seem that great don&#039;t waste your time on it&nbsp; :P
