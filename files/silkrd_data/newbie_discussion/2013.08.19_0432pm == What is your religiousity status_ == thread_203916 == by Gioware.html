				dont talk religion unless you want a fight, but whatever, here it goes:<br /><br />personally im athiest but i have no problem with religious people until they start bashing on homosexuals or other minority groups, and that religion shouldnt be about that or blabbering on and on about how god is so great, it should be about being a kind person and worshipping a god in your own way and not having to pay money to a church

				Not religious anymore, but grew up on a cult compound in the middle of nowhere. I&#039;m still very interested in religion and religious people.

				WOW, I don&#039;t think I have ever seen one of these where people can really speak what they think with out a baptist or JW throwing a major fit. <br /><br />I personally try to be a good person, I may not follow my government&#039;s idea of what a good person is but I am honest and I don&#039;t fuck people around for no reason and that is more then I can say for them, lol. <br /><br />Also I like galileosophia&#039;s statement <br />&quot;1.&nbsp; I, nor anyone else, knows the origin of the universe.<br />2.&nbsp; The burden of proof is on the person making claims about having the final truth for mankind.&quot; <br /><br />The bible is not proof. Even if it were true, it would no longer have any meaning because every person just twists it to say what they want. <br /><br />Don&#039;t tell anyone here in these mountains I speak like this. My yard would be filled with fat old women telling me how they are better then me, atleast my government would allow me to shoot them if they wouldn&#039;t leave. Then I would be all over the news though and the situation portrayed as a massacre and a statement against christianity. Then some christian would twist something else in the bible to make it right to hurt me or my family. So you tell me who is dangerous, lol.<br /><br />Sorry about that, I was baptist raised and have developed a sort of hate for christians, I really try not to hate anyone but damn. If anyone here has ever spent more then a week in the south eastern US you would know what I mean.

				I don&#039;t believe in a god nor do I have reason to believe in any sort of afterlife which extends beyond how we breakdown and our atoms are reused by other organisms for food.

				There exists a system of truth that can be proven through correlation,<br />but still of course faith is needed.<br /><br />But &quot;faith&quot; is something we use everyday anyway, faith in life, faith in others.<br /><br />Anyway the number 7 defines this system of principles, which is found<br />everywhere and in everything, even in our 7-day weekly cycle.<br /><br />I bet nobody here knows why there are exactly 7 days....<br /><br />It seems nobody is aware of the secrets of the number 7.
