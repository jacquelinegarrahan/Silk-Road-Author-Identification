				Like how much money? <br /><br />If you got alot to launder, a good thing to do is buy run down, beat up property. <br />Then spend/launder your cash paying builders to renovate your newly acquired house. <br /><br />Soon you&#039;ll be left with a property worth alot more than the one you started with and you can legally sell it to get a ton of money back.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone asks, you paid FA for it to begin with and it just so happened to be worth hundreds of thousands/millions in profit. <br /><br />

				If you&#039;re interested in laundering fiat money, just talk to a lawyer, you have attorney privilege.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think property would be a good way, you might just lose the value. One council decision and you&#039;re fucked. With the IRS you might have to prove how you got it. If I was an American I would seek professional help: a lawyer, who could probably point you to a good mobster. Like a Saul Goodman.

				Set up a legitimate business. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be unbelievably successful and turn a good profit. <br /><br />The only downside is you&#039;ll be paying tax.

That amount of money is going to spike interest in people who would try to take advantage of you in one way or another. You need a lawyer and an accountant.

				Fiat basically means power. It means what is money and is only money because we are forced to use it as money.

You can buy them with Bitcoin for instance on Blackmarket Reloaded. I&#039;ve seen anonymous bank accounts in others names you can get which have Internet banking, SWIFT transfers, and stuff like that. You still have to walk into a bank to get the money there. Even with an offshore account, if you&#039;ve got cash, you&#039;ve got to make a bank transfer. If you went to the actual Caymens and shown you had a case full of cash I&#039;m dead sure you would be able to open an account. I&#039;m pretty sure you just have to make a huge term deposit somehow. But my finance is rusty.<br /><br />I really strongly, as a legal enthusiast, recommend a lawyer.
