				Maybe someone can give me a little advice on what has happened here b/c I have searched through the shipping section and my situation is a little weird. I&#039;m in the US by the way. A friend of mine ordered a gift online for me and it was shipped from the UK. It arrived with the Green tape on it indicating customs had inspected it but my gift isn&#039;t in the package and I didn&#039;t receive a letter from customs saying it was seized. The only thing I have ever ordered from the UK was a couple RC&#039;s awhile back and it came through fine. I have made a few orders in SR with no problems but I only order from domestic vendors. Do you guys think that my address was previously flagged from the only other time I had a package from England? Or was this just a random inspection that wasn&#039;t resealed properly and my gift fell out in transit in the US? Also, does it seem safe to continue to order using the same address. Thanks for any advice!

				Doubtful they had flagged your purchase from before, seeing as you received the RCs, and its unlikely they actually took your purchase this time. After all why send the box to you with nothing in it? Probably just a dick inspector swiped it. Can you say what it is though? Some things are verboten to import into the US, even if its not illegal.

				I&#039;m not going to say exactly what it is b/c this forum is not exactly hidden from LE but it was totally legal in a little box.

If you feel like it you can probably submit a complaint to the customs office and see if they can&#039;t find your item. They keep track of what inspector opened each package, and there is a chance you can get it back. If not well welcome to the wonderful world of government agencies. Chances are some 18 year old drop out is feeling particularly clever with himself for having swiped your item and re-sealed the box.

				That&#039;s some shit luck man, like wsd23 said you don&#039;t have many options. I&#039;ve heard stories like this before and they all ended in no real resolution but that&#039;s the government for you I guess.

				So I should just assume it was totally random that the package was even opened by customs? Do you think that the local post office or postal worker will now be looking at my packages with more scrutiny now that they have seen the package that was empty with customs tape on it? If so there really is nothing they could o anyway right?

				Was it food, animal product or anything like that maybe? If so possibly they didn&#039;t want it coming from outside the borders as a threat to local plant/animal life? Could also be that once it was sealed back up someone at the post dept took a chance to put some sticky fingers in as it was already &quot;open&quot;
