				It seems like his delivery times have been really shit lately, I don&#039;t think he is actually scamming people.. Most get their product, it&#039;s just been taking a long time!

				Taken not tooked. 15 days takes the piss when its suppose to be next day and when you can get it from other dealers next day and when you have to finalize early. Mr Cronk is in over his head I wouldn&#039;t recommend him to anyone. If its 30 days might as well be an international order. All I&#039;m saying is know what your getting into with him. When you finalize early and send a load of money to someone and they say its Next day but it takes over 15 don&#039;t bother with them, we have duty as buyers to not let dealers take the piss.

				I&#039;m not english, try to talk my language and i we will see. <br /><br />With the feedback that you gave him, all in caps lock, if i was Mr cronk, i would just tell you to stfu and even if the package dont arrive, i would offer you a 0% refund<br /><br />You seem like a child. You had to finalize early? well, that is well writen on his profile. And the support that have have when f.e, that is 0%, it is too well writen in every place of this community. <br /><br />and btw, vendors dont have your life. they have to do many things to kids like you have their package. so, give a vendor until 3 days to he respond, and dont be worried. <br /><br />

				If you don&#039;t think 15 days takes the piss when its suppose to be next day fine buy off him all you like. If a vendor can&#039;t do what he says he&#039;ll do he shouldn&#039;t take on new custom. I&#039;m just trying to get a warning out there for anyone who thinks this takes the piss and who doesn&#039;t want to wait that amount of time with no communication when they can go else where. If I get the goods I&#039;m happy to edit the feedback and delete this thread. I just don&#039;t wont others to be in my situation.
