Slightly more stem-y or leafy sometimes, or just smaller, bottom-of-the-jar nugs. Good weed for joints to be shared with a group of friends. This is NOT shake or mids, and not to be confused with such!<br /><br />***Mid-Shelf***<br />Very well-cured, good-to-great trichome coverage, and usually super-stanky, my Mid-Shelf buds are what manage to find their way into my pipe or bong most days. THC range tends to be 14 - 23% on most of these strains, and a high calyx-to-leaf ration ensures smooth smoke. Good enough to hoard, but cheap enough to share, these buds are already getting better reviews than some vendors&#039; &quot;top-shelf!&quot;<br /><br />***Top-Shelf***<br />Only the very best of the best that I&#039;ve ever smoked can be called &quot;Top-Shelf,&quot; in my opinion. Perfectly cured, crazy potent, aroma that&#039;s to die for, &quot;are you sure this isn&#039;t laced?!&quot; THAT is what I call Top-Shelf, which is why you probably won&#039;t see me carrying *huge* amounts of it... there just isn&#039;t that much out there! ;)<br /><br />The general pricing structure for the weed is as follows:<br /><br />Low-Shelf-<br />1g - $15 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $11.25)<br />3.5g - $35 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $26.25)<br />7g - $65 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $48.75)<br />14g - $120 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $90)<br />28g - $220 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $165)<br /><br />Mid-Shelf-<br />1g - $20 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $15)<br />3.5g - $50 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $37.50)<br />7g - $90 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $67.50)<br />14g - $160 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $120)<br />28g - $280 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $210)<br /><br />Top-Shelf-<br />1g - $25 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $18.75)<br />3.5g - $65 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $48.75)<br />7g - $110 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $82.50)<br />14g - $190 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $142.50)<br />28g - $350 (25% OFF INTRO SALE - $262.50)<br /><br />These are subject to change or modification without notice! The price is based upon what I pay for it, not my subjective assessment of the quality; if it costs me a little more or less than usual, this will be reflected in the listing price!<br /><br />-----<br />USING OUR PRODUCTS<br />-----<br />It is highly recommended that you measure all of the liquid products with a simple plastic syringe, available at virtually all grocery stores and pharmacies (usually for measuring children&#039;s medication). We recently got some of these in to throw in for free with orders of the liquid products. &lt;3<br /><br />THE GHB IS 0.5g/mL, OR 5mL (1 TEASPOON) PER DOSE.<br /><br />THE 2C-I AND 2C-E ARE 5mg/mL OR 3mL (JUST UNDER 3/4 TEASPOON) PER DOSE.<br /><br />I recommend dissolving either of these into about 12oz of strongly flavored fruit juice to mask the flavor, and then sipping it slowly over a period of about 30 minutes. This will make for a smoother come-up with less negative somatic effects, in my experience. ;)<br /><br />IF YOU NEED INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DOSE CANNABIS THEN... WELL... HOW DID YOU EVEN FIND THIS PLACE? LOL<br /><br />-----<br />SHIPPING<br />-----<br />I SHIP WITHIN THE 50 US STATES ONLY. ORDERS OUTSIDE OF THE USA WILL BE CANCELLED!<br /><br />I use only USPS Priority Mail and Express Mail service. Do not ask me to use first-class, or any other service/carrier; I will not.<br /><br />Most orders will ship within 24 hours of being placed, some a bit sooner, some later. Now that I am flying solo, I do not have the resources to be quite as fast; my apologies for this. Expect to see your package within 2 - 3 days of being marked &quot;in transit.&quot;<br /><br />I take whatever address you send me and copy/paste/print/label the package. You MUST use your real name and address. If it does not show up due to non-delivery because of a fake name, or any NOT on file with the USPS for that address, I WILL NOT refund or re-ship! If the package gets lost/stuck/destroyed due to circumstances beyond your control (hasn&#039;t happened yet), then contact me to discuss refund/re-ship options. If the tracking number shows that it was delivered, no dice.<br /><br />You will NEVER be required to sign for one of my packages! I only use Priority Mail with USPS tracking (does not require a signature) or Express Mail (which normally requires a signature, but I always choose &quot;signature waiver&quot;). Once again: YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO SIGN FOR ONE OF MY PACKAGES!!!<br /><br />Please do not ever hesitate to contact me via personal message, the forums, or foreverjung@tormail.org if you have any questions about my products and services. I am striving to maintain a 100% feedback rating, but more than that I am striving to *deserve* it. If you are unhappy with anything for any reason, please let me know, and I will find a way to resolve it.<br /><br />Thank you so much for looking at my listings! Love and light to all, and have a great fuckin&#039; day! &lt;3

				Thanks for your interest! Yes, we are only doing GHB for the moment. We should have samples ready of a few strains of bud in a few days to a week, and edibles shortly after that.<br /><br />We are also considering offering small amounts of liquid 2C-I and 2C-E if there is interest. We are open to suggestions! &lt;3

				We are hoping to have the bud samples (1g each of a few different strains) ready to go this weekend. We will keep everyone updated. ;)<br /><br />We just added an option for combined shipping, so if you want to try free samples of each product (currently just the GHB and 2C-I) you only have to pay for shipping once.<br /><br />Thanks for looking, and have a badass day! &lt;3

				Better jump on these FREE SAMPLES of GHB and 2C-I, they&#039;re going fast! :D<br /><br />And, just to make certain that everyone has enough material to give it a thorough evaluation, we are DOUBLING the free samples of GHB to 20mL! That&#039;s right, you only pay shipping ($8) and now you get FOUR full doses instead of two! To those that have already ordered, we went ahead and doubled those as well- so expect TWO of the 10mL vials in your shipment instead of one. ;)<br /><br />We believe that our products and service are top-notch, and that you&#039;ll agree, which is why we&#039;re offering them to you (nearly) free, so that you can try us out with little to no risk.<br /><br />THANKS FOR LOOKING AND HAVE A FUCKIN&#039; GROOVY DAY EVERYBODY! &lt;3

				OK! We are finally ready with some FREE SAMPLES of dank kind bud and 2C-E!!! We know you guys will be excited to try these out, and they will probably go wicked fast, so grab &#039;em while you can! Reminder: you MUST have at least 10 transactions and NO auto-finalize in order to acquire our samples. You must also pay for shipping on at least one of the items; the &quot;combined&quot; shipping option may be used for any additional items after the first one. Each buyer with adequate stats is allowed ONE free sample of each item. Please do not purchase the listing if you cannot adhere these requirements, as the order will be cancelled! Thank you. :)<br /><br />We ask specifically that everyone only select ONE strain of weed to try for now; we would absolutely love to give everyone out there a taste of several strains at once (to get an idea of the variety to which we have access) , but simply don&#039;t have the available re$ources... yet. ;)<br /><br />We have samples of Flo and Afghani Bubba OG Kush ready to go now, and will have a couple more strains in a day or 2. Things will be starting slow as we invest a bit of time and money into getting as many samples out to people as possible, so that everyone has a chance to experience the quality we have to offer. Our number one goal is to maintain the highest level of service possible for everyone that orders our products.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the Flo: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/33c2d820df<br /><br />Afghani Bubba OG Kush: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/bfd1fda353<br /><br />And the samples of liquid 2C-E: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/4b637255fd<br /><br />And just a few more samples of the 2C-I left for those who haven&#039;t grabbed them yet: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2d56888626<br /><br />Thank you so much for the overwhelming initial response, everyone! We will have more GHB in stock very soon, and will continue to expand our selection of weed and psychedelics as best we can. Have a superfuckinwonderful Wednesday! &lt;3

				I received my package today from the new vendor ForeverJung. He was kind enough to provide me with samples of 4 different strains so I will be spacing the reviews out over the next day or so. I&#039;m happy to be the first to review FJ&#039;s bud and give this guy the praise he deserves. I&#039;ve been very impressed with the way he has come on the scene with a strong forum presence and great customer service. Everything about this vendor is top notch, and I have no doubt that he will be very successful on SR. <br /><br />The review...<br /><br />Communication (5/5) - I&#039;ve talked with FJ quite a bit over the last few weeks, and he is an awesome guy. The first thing that caught my eye was his name, which I thought was clever and just pretty cool. He has ended up exceeding all of my expectations. Very quick to respond to any questions, and always helpful and willing to go the extra mile to satisfy his customers. I really can&#039;t say enough about FJ. Get to know him. He&#039;ll take good care of you.<br /><br />Shipping (5/5) - Unbelievably quick. By far the least amount of time that I have had to wait on a package from SR. I ordered early Wednesday morning, and it was in my mailbox today, Friday. You just cannot ask for anything more than that. When it comes to shipping/response time, FJ is on top of it. You can expect to have no issues in this department when dealing with him.<br /><br />Stealth/Packaging (5/5) - The packaging was second to none. FJ clearly puts a lot of care into his stealth, and it shows. Outside of the box was clean and discreet, with professionally printed labels and no shoddy tape jobs. Inside was very well done as well, with plenty of visual barriers. A clever combination of bubble wrap, mylar bags and vacuum sealing ensured that this package would undoubtedly reach its destination. Absolutely no smell until breaking the final seal. Professionalism all the way around. <br /><br />Product (4.5/5) - Flo Mid-Shelf (Clearnet pic -------&gt; http://i.imgur.com/eX8vhRs.jpg)<br /><br />The first sample I tried out was the Flo. FJ has this strain listed as mid shelf, although it could certainly pass as top shelf in a lot of areas around the country. Don&#039;t let the name fool you; this is excellent weed. The scent is a nice subtle combination of floral and sour notes, with almost a bit of menthol undertone to it. A bit of fruitiness, as well. It&#039;s not overpowering (though not faint either), but still very pleasant and inviting. The spear-like buds are a mixture of mid and light green, with some dense purple calyxes scattered about. A nice amount of light reddish-orange hairs, and an abundance of trichomes. Very frosty looking buds, with only a slight amount of leaf present. Fairly well trimmed and properly cured, if a bit on the dry side. The bud ground up nicely and produced a ton of kief. Speaking of kief, the inside of the jar looked like this ---&gt; (http://i.imgur.com/MJ471mZ.jpg) Yeah, mid shelf. :D<br /><br />The taste has a lot of the same characteristics as the smell, although the sourness is not as apparent. The fruitiness and smooth menthol flavor is there in nice balance, and is especially recognizable on the exhale. The smoke is strong and expansive. Not harsh, but certainly potent. The buds were flushed well and burned down to a white ash. The high is a very nice balance of both indica and sativa traits, as a good hybrid should be. It seems to be really close to 50/50. There is a clear, energetic sativa buzz that sets in first, and a strong, heavy hit of indica follows almost immediately. It works in very nice balance, as opposed to coming in waves of one or the other. Just the way a good hybrid should be. It ends up being a soothing, peaceful body stone with a crisp, unusually high mental clarity. Very nice.<br /><br />Overall (5/5) - I really can&#039;t say enough about ForeverJung. Like I said before, he exceeded my expectations in every possible way and I have no doubt that he will gain many loyal customers here on SR. Everything about his product and service is top notch. Thanks again for letting me sample your buds, FJ. I look forward to doing more business with you in the future. <br />

A clever combination of bubble wrap, mylar bags and vacuum sealing ensured that this package would undoubtedly reach its destination. Absolutely no smell until breaking the final seal. Professionalism all the way around. <br /><br />Product (5/5) - Kosher Kush (Clearnet pic -------&gt; http://i.imgur.com/lZvIpKl.jpg)<br /><br />The second strain I sampled was the Kosher Kush. This was quite possibly the best bud that I have come across on SR. It is absolutely fabulous. The minute I popped open the jar I was overwhelmed with a pungent aroma of just pure dank. It can best be described as a potent mixture of OG and fuel. Earthy, piney, with slight hints of mint and sweetness. There&#039;s nothing subtle or faint about the smell of this KK; it is just straight gas. The bud have a slightly above medium density, and are a faint lime green color with bright orange pistils wrapped around. However, you can hardly see any of that because the nugs are absolutely smothered with a thick layer of shiny trichs. Seriously, this bud just glistens. Giving it a slight squeeze revealed a near perfect cure, as the bud had just the right amount of give and felt almost like squeezing a delicate stress ball. Very sticky, but still ground up wonderfully and left behind a TON of kief. <br /><br />If there was any question as to why the Flo was labeled as mid shelf, the answer came after smoking this KK. The kush genetics of the KK were much more noticeable in the taste. Very smooth inhale, with a rich earthiness and sweet, piney undertones. I want to say a bit of lemon mixed in as well. The exhale brings out more of the gas and a little more of the piney flavor, with a nice sweetness at the finish. As with the Flo, a bright white ash indicated a proper flush. Immediately heavy on the eyelids, with a powerful rush of soothing peacefulness soon following. This is a HARD hitting indica, and just gets you flat out STONED. I mean, I don&#039;t know how else to put it. You will just melt into whatever you happen to be sitting on (I sure hope you&#039;re sitting down), and the warm, tranquil buzz will put you in a trance. This is just fantastic marijuana. <br /><br />Overall (5/5) - I really can&#039;t say enough about ForeverJung. Like I said before, he exceeded my expectations in every possible way and I have no doubt that he will gain many loyal customers here on SR. Everything about his product and service is top notch. Thanks again for letting me sample your buds, FJ. I look forward to doing more business with you in the future. <br />

				Holy cow! Thanks so much for the kind review, dothedamnthing. We feel like our weed is pretty top-notch, and frankly all of what we sent you was our mid-shelf, including the Kosher Kush! We say that not based upon our subjective take on the quality, but based upon the prices we pay to our supplier. We plan to offer a limited amount of &quot;top-shelf,&quot; which will be a bit pricy, but only the very best of the best that we&#039;ve ever had gets to be called &quot;top-shelf&quot; in our opinion. ;)<br /><br />Some important things we would like to point out to everyone:<br /><br />1. PLEASE ONLY CHOOSE ONE STRAIN WHEN GETTING THE FREE SAMPLES OF BUD! We would love to give out a few strains to everyone, but unfortunately we just don&#039;t have that much to give out for free right now, and we want as many people as possible to have the chance to try our buds. We will try to give each person the opportunity to sample each of our three tiers (Discount, Mid-Shelf, and Top-Shelf), but especially for now, PLEASE KEEP IT TO ONE STRAIN ONLY WHEN ORDERING, THANK YOU!<br /><br />2. YOU MUST PAY FOR SHIPPING. The &quot;combined&quot; option is only for additional items after you&#039;ve already paid for shipping once, that&#039;s why it says MUST PAY FOR SHIPPING AT LEAST ONCE. Again, as cool as it would be to give out free samples WITH free shipping to everyone who would like to try our products, we simply can&#039;t afford to do anything like that right now.<br /><br />3. YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST 10 TRANSACTIONS AND NO AUTO-FINALIZE TO ORDER A FREE SAMPLE! We do not feel comfortable sending out samples to those with less than 10 purchases, and we will not (*can* not, technically) ask anyone to finalize early.<br /><br />Thanks for understanding, guys! We want to get as many of these samples out to people as possible, and it&#039;s been a little rocky to start but things are definitely taking off! Hopefully the GHB will be back in stock early next week, and we plan to expand our selection of weed (as well as start having regular 3.5g and 7g listings) ASAP.<br /><br />Hope everyone&#039;s having a badass weekend! Love to all! &lt;3

				So sad, tried to order the samples from ForeverJung but I did not have the 10 orders. I have placed 8 but only showing 2. Anyway I was sent a refund, but sadly the refund was short .01. Oh well, hopefully I will be able to try these samples soon.

				I received my package yesterday from the new vendor ForeverJung. He was kind enough to provide me with samples of 4 different strains so I will be spacing the reviews out over the next day or so. I&#039;m happy to be the first to review FJ&#039;s bud and give this guy the praise he deserves. I&#039;ve been very impressed with the way he has come on the scene with a strong forum presence and great customer service. Everything about this vendor is top notch, and I have no doubt that he will be very successful on SR. <br /><br />The review...<br /><br />Communication (5/5) - I&#039;ve talked with FJ quite a bit over the last few weeks, and he is an awesome guy. The first thing that caught my eye was his name, which I thought was clever and just pretty cool. He has ended up exceeding all of my expectations. Very quick to respond to any questions, and always helpful and willing to go the extra mile to satisfy his customers. I really can&#039;t say enough about FJ. Get to know him. He&#039;ll take good care of you.<br /><br />Shipping (5/5) - Unbelievably quick. By far the shortest amount of time that I have had to wait on a package from SR. I ordered early Wednesday morning, and it was in my mailbox today, Friday. You just cannot ask for anything more than that. When it comes to shipping/response time, FJ is on top of it. You can expect to have no issues in this department when dealing with him.<br /><br />Stealth/Packaging (5/5) - The packaging was second to none. FJ clearly puts a lot of care into his stealth, and it shows. Outside of the box was clean and discreet, with professionally printed labels and no shoddy tape jobs. Inside was very well done as well, with plenty of visual barriers. A clever combination of bubble wrap, mylar bags and vacuum sealing ensured that this package would undoubtedly reach its destination. Absolutely no smell until breaking the final seal. Professionalism all the way around. <br /><br />Product (4/5) - Afghan Bubba OG Kush (Clearnet pic -------&gt; http://i.imgur.com/vvQfxP7.jpg)<br /><br />The third strain of FJ&#039;s that I sampled was the Afghan Bubba OG Kush. This had the familiar sweet aroma of its Bubba genetics; pungent and sweet, with a little bit of mango/citrus. Sort of bubblegummy, if that&#039;s a word. The earthy undertones of the OG were also present, with maybe a slight hint of skunkiness. The bud is a bright lime green with a slight bit of purple, and flaming orange pistils. It is not particularly dense, but rather more on the fluffy side. There&#039;s a nice layer of trichs covering the bud, leaves and stem. Similar to the Flo, it is a bit dry, but retains a nice texture when crumbled up. Sticky as hell and probably needs a grinder or scissors to break down.<br /><br />The Bubba was also highly recognizable in the taste, with the sweetness being the main trait noticed on the inhale. The OG stands out a little more on the exhale, with a strong musky flavor and a bit of spiciness. A bit of a hash undertone lingers for a while after the hit. This is a nice hybrid which leans more toward the indica side. Provides a nice energetic burst initially, and then smooths out into a pretty strong body buzz that warms you up and leaves you fully relaxed, but still focused. Another very good quality strain.<br /><br />Overall (5/5) - I really can&#039;t say enough about ForeverJung. Like I said before, he exceeded my expectations in every possible way and I have no doubt that he will gain many loyal customers here on SR. Everything about his product and service is top notch.

A clever combination of bubble wrap, mylar bags and vacuum sealing ensured that this package would undoubtedly reach its destination. Absolutely no smell until breaking the final seal. Professionalism all the way around. <br /><br />Product (5/5) - Tora Bora (Clearnet pic -------&gt; http://i.imgur.com/QuHQ7EK.jpg)<br /><br />The final strain that I sampled was the Tora Bora. As it turns out, I unknowingly saved the best for last. This was just an amazing strain to experience. It did not have a particularly distinct or pungent smell to it. It was more of a faint, spicy scent with slight floral hints. Maybe a bit piney, but nothing in strong amounts. The bud was absolutely gorgeous. It&#039;s a mixture of dark and mid green with bright reddish-orange pistils crawling all over. The obscene amount of sparkly trichomes makes the bud appear a bit lighter in color than it actually is. It appears as if it was dipped in sugar. Some serious bag appeal going on here. The bud is almost perfectly cured and bounces back nicely upon squeezing it. It pretty much coated the entire inside of my grinder with keif.<br /><br />I decided to vape this bud after using my glass for the other strains. The vapor was incredibly smooth for such a hard hitter. The spiciness was most prevalent on the inhale, but the taste could best be described as just &quot;dank.&quot; I&#039;m sure you all know what I mean. The undertones of hash were present and the exhale had a bit of a sweet and sour aftertaste that lingered in the mouth. If I&#039;m not mistaken, I believe this Tora Bora is a pure indica, and man, it doesn&#039;t fuck around. This stuff will put you on your ass. My eyes were almost immediately droopy, and I felt the buzz run down through my shoulders and spread throughout the rest of my body. It wasn&#039;t long before I was slammed with a heavy full body stone. I mean HEAVY. This is some serious medicine. It has high levels of CBD which are amazing for pain relief. The effects are very long lasting when compared to most other strains. Just an incredibly enjoyable, peaceful trance that is like no other. This is a strain every cannabis lover needs to experience. <br /><br />Overall (5/5) - I really can&#039;t say enough about ForeverJung. Like I said before, he exceeded my expectations in every possible way and I have no doubt that he will gain many loyal customers here on SR. Everything about his product and service is top notch. Thanks again for letting me sample your buds, FJ. I look forward to doing more business with you in the future.

				Quoted from another thread:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=153040.msg1061417#msg1061417">Quote from: Hanzelpie on April 28, 2013, 08:13 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Purchased a sample [S&amp;H cost only] and finally got a chance to indulge in it responsibly without obligations etc so since I cant post over in rumor mill yet I&#039;d figure I&#039;d post an in-depth endorsement here.<br /><br />This is only my 2nd time using GHB in any form so I don&#039;t have a frame of reference and my opinion is mostly subjective, however, being a male of a rather large body weight and using 1mL of a 50% K-GHB sample clearly it felt very unique compared to the dozens of benzodiazepines and even quaalude analogs I have used over the years -- presumably due to its affinity for GABA-b receptors. Based on that experience I say subjectively the 50% purity can be trusted. Its taste is very oily as is consistent with a buttery-like semi-solid GHB I ordered a year ago so makes sense the liquidifed form is oily. <br /><br />Without going into details that would aid relevant customs / USPS inspector service profiling I will say that this was by far the most discreetly packaged item I&#039;ve ever received -- and keep in mind this is a liquid product in glass something bulky and not as easy to conceal as a gram or less or powder or even tablets. I can say for certain that based on what I know I can say that not even the keenest eye would suspect the contents -- they most likely wouldnt show upn so easily if at all as glass bottles on the screen [and I have no first hand knowledge with this, just knowledge of how cargo inspection radiography works and canine detection] Further. based on the several layers and methodology, I would be shocked if canines would ever indicate suspicion on these shipments :) <br /><br />I can tell subjectively if a compound is hitting GABAa type receptor types more than GABAb and benzos tend to hit Gaba-A much more than B, well the opposite is true of GHB -- and very few other compounds stimulate such a unique combo of DA release on top of GABA-b agonism [again, I must say I am not a clinical pharmacologist and I state this opinion based on personal indulgences of CNS hypnotic sedatives over the years, including dangerous convulsant ones analoguous to Methaqualone and lesser used Benzodiazepines like Phenazepam, &quot;OTC&quot; GABA-ergic agents like Phenibut, and Baclofen and I base these observations from a subjective point of view with my limited pharmacodynamic knowledge and years of consciousness experimentation with every drug class except deliriants [no thanks] -- unscheduled limited run &quot;Research chemicals&quot; and Scheduled ones alike. <br /><br />So in short, out of two GHB vendors -- one selling unspecified purity waxy/buttery GHB that was far weaker than Jung&#039;s [and more expensive] I recommend Jung&#039;s liquid K-GHB and though they are one of the bulkier items to receive, you need not worry about it getting detected based on my careful examination of each layer of packaging and how it obfuscates the contents. <br /><br />Not able to comment on any human growth hormone related effects that some GHB users seem to seek as I do not currently work out and so that point is moot lol but I say with all I know that he is the go to vendor for US buyers. The seller of the buttery GHB moved onto selling cannabis for awhile and disappeared months ago so I dont feel need to mention their nickname. lol. <br /><br />Also packed in a way where if a postal inspector shakes it around they wont hear glass bottles clinking around nor will the contents leak [i always check this for liquid items]. I have no faults to articulate on the packaging method. <br /><br />Anyway looking forward to being able to post these in the relevant threads in rumor mill once I accrue enough posts, but since it was a free sample less S&amp;H i wanted to post an elaborate review having enjoyed this powerful compound and being able to trust in someone&#039;s liquid GHB [something very rare from what I have read -- where over the years batches could vary wildly -- but i say these are definitely 50% as advertised and isnt some RC or benzo dissolved etc. it has that signature oily presence. Holding bottles up to light showed crystal clear liquid with no visible impurities. I ingested orally wiith a soft drink and effects hit you strong consistent with its widely known rapid peak as depicted on an erowid chart&#039;s dose-response curve.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I&#039;m going to go ahead and post my reviews of ForeverJung&#039;s 4/20 contest entries in here. FJ was kind enough to let me review his buds and edibles for the contest and everything was excellent and fared very well. We should have the results posted in the next couple of days. You can check out the main thread here ----&gt; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=108906.200<br /><br />This was strictly a competition of product, so we didn&#039;t factor communication, shipping speed or stealth/packaging into the scores. But, FJ is the man and as always, this was all top notch. He will take great care of you and you should order with total confidence from him. He has gone above and beyond and I am truly thankful for all that he has done.

Forest green with shades of brighter green and bits of frosty purple. Flaming orange pistils.<br /><br />Trich Coverage - (9.5/10) - Pretty much totally frosted. Just coated with sparkling trichs everywhere you look.<br /><br />Trim Job - (9/10) - A bit leafy but still a nice trim job. Leaves are coated with trichs like everything else.<br /><br />Flush - (9/10) - Incredibly smooth smoke for such a hard hitting strain. Creamy and white smoke, with no thickness or harshness. Burned down to a bright, soft white ash.<br /><br />Cure - (9.25/10) - Almost perfect density and texture. Solid structure and fluffs up beautifully upon grinding, while retaining a silky texture and burning evenly.<br /><br />Smell - (9.25/10) - Faint, piney scent with hints of citrus. A pleasant musky undertone with bits of sweetness. Becomes more prevalent and pungent after breaking down the bud.<br /><br />Taste - (9.25/10) - A bit of spiciness on the inhale, with a nice sweet and sour finish that lingers in the mouth for a while. The muskiness from the smell comes through more on the exhale but is complimented nicely by the sweetness, which is not overpowering.<br /><br />Buzz - (9.5/10) - What a true indica is all about. Heavy on the eyelids immediately, then slams you into a full body stone. HEAVY, but tranquil at the same time. Narcotic-like effects. Seriously potent medicine.

				Vendor: ForeverJung ----&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/503d93d76d<br /><br />Strain: Death Star ----&gt; http://i.imgur.com/HWAy3P0.jpg<br /><br />Category: Hybrid<br /><br />Color/Appearance (Bag Appeal) - (9.25/10) - Another beautiful entry from ForeverJung. This bud has a solid structure and is a bright green with bits of darker green leaf and really bright reddish-orange pistils. Slight bits of faint purple are present as well and the bud has an overall &quot;chunky&quot; look to it that adds to the appeal.<br /><br />Trich Coverage - (9.25/10) - Drenched in a sticky layer of trichs that give the bud a glistening effect and make it appear to be a bit lighter in color than it actually is. Almost a bit of a two-tone effect going on here; once it&#039;s broken into the darker greens become apparent but the trichs are still everywhere. An overly abundant amount of kief coated the grinder when I was finished.<br /><br />Trim Job - (8.75/10) - A bit of darker green leaf is present throughout but it houses a high amount of the trichs and really adds to the overall visual appeal of the bud with the contrast of greens. You can see in the picture how the leaf sticking out at the bottom is shiny and frosted. The bud is still very tightly trimmed and certainly not leafy in the normal sense.<br /><br />Flush - (9/10) - A proper flush gave this bud a pretty smooth smoke with only a slight bit of lung expansion on the exhale. Certainly potent, but not harsh. The smoke was more hazy than thick and the bud burned to a bright off-white ash that was fine and soft.<br /><br />Cure - (9/10) - Well cured, with a nice bounce back upon giving it a gentle squeeze. A bit of crunchiness, but not at all dry. This bud ground up beautifully, and once it was ground it had a softer, smoother texture than was initially apparent. A nice balance between density and squeezability.<br /><br />Smell - (9.25/10) - A very pungent aroma, with strong hints of diesel and lemony-citrus undertones. A nice musky earthiness keeps the scent in nice balance and provides a good backdrop to the strong diesel and slightly sour, minty undertones.<br /><br />Taste - (9.25/10) - Potent but not overwhelming, with the diesel dominating both the inhale and exhale. Almost a bit of a minty, menthol-like taste comes through on the exhale, along with a nice sweetness and more of the diesel. The hints of sourness and citrus are most noticeable on the inhale, while the diesel flavor is potent and apparent throughout. <br /><br />Buzz - (9/10) - Hit behind the eyes at first, and spread into a calming cerebral buzz with an added social effect and clear thought process. The indica buzz came out of nowhere and took over the head high, although the mental clarity and heightened sense of awareness remained. A stronger body buzz than I was expecting, but not debilitating or overly potent; just a nice hybrid with a good amount of each quality.

				Vendor: ForeverJung ----&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/503d93d76d<br /><br />Strain: Boston OG ----&gt; http://i.imgur.com/eMSsHrq.jpg<br /><br />Category: Sativa<br /><br />Color/Appearance (Bag Appeal) - (9/10) - Nice looking buds which have almost a golden overtone. They are spear shaped and feature a bright lime green color with bits of darker green and fiery orange hairs crawling around.<br /><br />Trich Coverage - (9.25/10) - Smothered in a layer of bright trichs which give the bud the aforementioned golden glow. Not particularly sticky but nevertheless a high abundance of crystals which add quite the visual effect and leave behind a healthy amount of kief after being ground up.<br /><br />Trim Job - (8.5/10) - A bit leafier than either the Tora Bora or the Death Star, but still an adequate trim job and more kiefy goodness to enjoy. The fan leaves add a bit of texture and contrast the color of the crystals and lighter green bud quite nicely. The golden hue almost makes it hard to even the notice the leaf until the bud is broken up.<br /><br />Flush - (8.75/10) - The bud was flushed well and burned to a slightly grainy bone colored ash, with bits of darker grey speckled throughout. The smoke was smooth and non-expansive, with only a slight bit of initial harshness which was quickly overtaken and did not return during later hits.<br /><br />Cure - (9/10) - Moderately dense and slightly spongy to the touch. Fluffed up nicely after grinding and retained the right balance of moistness and crunchiness. A nice soft, velvety texture which really came alive after grinding and provided a clean and even burn.<br /><br />Smell - (9/10) - A sharp and pungent mix of fuel and lemony-pine aromas, with a slight hint of earthy muskiness. Once ground up the aroma really burst out and featured more of the citrus, along with a slight bit of spiciness and a heavy amount of strong fuel. The piney scent was more faint after breaking open the nug but was still present in small amounts.<br /><br />Taste - (9/10) - The sweet presence of kush is apparent almost immediately, and is present in both the inhale and exhale, with the exhale being more dominant. The citrus and piney flavors come through on the inhale, with the exhale bringing out more of the fuel and a slight bit of the sweet and sourness. A nice earthy finish with lingering sweetness and small hints of sourness.<br /><br />Buzz - (9.25/10) - A really nice, spacey high washes over first, with high motivation and mental alertness. A somewhat pulsing body buzz creeps up a bit later, but is not as potent and doesn&#039;t overtake the initial heady, soaring high. The body buzz sort of comes in waves, while the cerebral high is present throughout and doesn&#039;t wane on the intensity. Heightened thoughts and a calming sense of well being were the most apparent effects and were persistent throughout the high.

				Vendor: ForeverJung ----&gt; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/503d93d76d<br /><br />Edible: Brownie ----&gt; http://i.imgur.com/fgDAUDQ.jpg<br /><br />Category: Edibles (Baked)<br /><br />Color/Appearance - (9.5/10) - This brownie looked amazing, with a nice light/dark swirl effect on top and some seriously dark, fudgy brownie goodness throughout the rest of it. It&#039;s also quite a bit bigger than it looks in the picture; definitely some serious love put into this thing.<br />&nbsp;<br />Package - (9.75/10) - Perfectly cared for and packaged, with the brownie itself being sealed in a plastic baggie and then placed in a Zip-Lock container to ensure maximum freshness.<br /><br />Cooking Job - (9.5/10) - So well done. The brownie was the perfect combination of moist and fudgy with no burnt ends or staleness at all. So soft and gooey, yet a nice firmness to it. It stayed intact and didn&#039;t fall apart, but chunked off very nicely when cut or pulled apart. Really nice chunky, moist texture and not the slightest bit of dryness.<br /><br />Freshness - (9.75/10) - ForeverJung told me he had just prepared this brownie and got it to me just in time for judging, and I certainly have no reason to doubt that. The brownie was as fresh as it could be after being in the mail for 2 days. Soft and fudgy, yet firm and chewy at the same time, and bursting with fresh flavor. A perfect ratio of moistness and texture.<br /><br />Feel - (9.5/10) - Just how you would want a brownie to feel. Chunky, with the right amount of firmness, and a soft chewy texture which stayed together and didn&#039;t crumble or flake apart. <br /><br />Smell - (9.75/10) - Really awesome. Nothing but the sweet smell of decadent chocolate was apparent, with no presence of the Headband hash oil that was used to make it. Just chocolatey goodness all over.<br /><br />Taste - (9.5/10) - Good lord. This was by far the best tasting edible that I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of consuming. After a quick warming up, it was perfectly soft and gooey, with an awesome amount of fudgy, chewy brownie flavor. The texture and consistency were near perfect, with just the right amount of firmness, but also a wonderful chewiness and soft, moist decadence to it. So fucking good.<br /><br />Buzz - (9.75/10) - Jesus Christ. Like I said earlier, the brownie was quite a bit bigger than it appears in the picture, so I was initially unsure of whether or not I should eat the whole thing. I finally said fuck it and just did it. About 45 minutes later, it hit me hard. I mean REALLY hard. This thing put me on my ass. In a good way, of course. Just a wondrous full body high which was so overly warm and soothing, and slightly euphoric. I mean, I was just flat out STONED like I haven&#039;t been in quite some time. The effects lasted a very long time, and started to trail off after around 6 hours. I was expecting to be left groggy, but surprisingly I wasn&#039;t at all. This was by far the best experience with an edible that I&#039;ve ever had.

				***RED ALERT:***<br /><br />I need cash desperately to pay my rent by Friday, since most of my funds are tied up in escrow/SR account. I have a small amount of weed left, as well as a decent bit of 2C-I and GHB. I will do the 2C-I for $125/7 vials (1,050mg) shipped, or the GHB for $50/100mL or $75/200mL shipped; prices only good while SR is down, and subject to sending BTC or moneypak in advance. Sorry guys, I just need cash as quickly as possible in order to be able to keep things going. Anything anyone would care to donate will be gladly refunded ASAP, with free goodies sent as a thank you when I&#039;m back on me feet.<br /><br />I hope that my reviews here prove that I&#039;m trustworthy and just in need of some help right now while the Road is being attacked. Thanks to everyone that has ordered from me so far, double thanks to those that have left reviews! I love you guys and this place so damned much; I don&#039;t wanna leave!!! :(

				Just wanted to give my review of my recent transaction with ForeverJung.&nbsp; Ordered a 10ml sample of GHB from him a week or so ago.&nbsp; I placed the order Friday evening and received it sometime the next day on Saturday.&nbsp; Fastest shipping ever.&nbsp; Also he doubled my order at no additional cost, bad ass!!&nbsp; His communication was top notch, always responded to every message I sent him within hours.&nbsp; As far as the product, it was top notch!&nbsp; It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve tried GHB and his was excellent quality.&nbsp; All in all, this was the most seemless transaction I have ever made on SR and am in the process of ordering more as we speak.&nbsp; Thanks again and keep up the good work ForeverJung!

				MDMA/MDA Capsules, 80mg + 50mg:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9e3068e4e8<br /><br />These are not part of the 25% off sale, that is to say, they aren&#039;t gonna go any higher in price in the future. In fact, I hope to make them *less* if I can find a cheaper (i.e. probably non-domestic) source for each one.<br /><br />Really good stuff, y&#039;all! Enjoy. :D

				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/71b26825ed<br /><br />HOLY SHIT Y&#039;ALL MOTHERFUCKIN 2C-B! :D<br /><br />I am about 4 hours in and beginning a gentle descent from 20mg of this liquid 2C-B solution. Very clean and energetic, moving and strongly sensual without ever being overwhelming. So intensely blissful. My companion, who&#039;d only had some GHB, ended up dozing off in the midst of us fooling around (lol), and I was equally content to shift gears and just hold her and watch her peacefully snoozing. I could probably still have sex for hours if she awoke and suddenly desired it, but am genuinely happy to sit here stroking her hair and typing on the forum. Damn, this is some good shit. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br /><br />More GHB in stock friday! I will accept pre-orders now from established customers and include at least 10% over once shipped, no need to FE. :) The listings are up, just in stealth mode, message me (preferably on sr) if you need the url.<br /><br />Thanks so much for being supportive thus far! I am working hard to keep things moving and bring you guys the best quality products and service that I possibly can. SR 4EVA!<br />

				JUST IN: liquid alprazolam (Xanax) solution!!! :D<br /><br />5mg for $5:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5f020a69b7<br /><br />15mg for $10:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/ccb45b6a75<br /><br />30mg for $15:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/1653b881f4<br /><br />No idea when GHB will be back, unfortunately, but I will have the listings up ASAP if/when I get more in stock... hoping also for more 2Cs and methylone (and possibly MDMA/MDA caps) within the month. No idea when I&#039;ll be able to afford more weed honestly; probably gonna have to end the sale prices on it when I do get more, as I was making basically no profit on the 25% off sale. lol<br /><br />Peace, y&#039;all! &lt;3
