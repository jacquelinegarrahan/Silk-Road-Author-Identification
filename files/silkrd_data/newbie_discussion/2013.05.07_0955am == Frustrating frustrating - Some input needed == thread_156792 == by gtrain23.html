				I take it you would have had to FE.<br /><br />And yes international orders can get seized.<br /><br />That is the risk you take.

				Probably it got seized. International orders (especially on certain nations) is very tricky. If I can I always order inside domestic, much less fuss both for you and the vendor. Naturally this is not always applicable but the more the quantity the more I think it&#039;s important.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry for your loss, but I think that if you search too much and the order is really being sized you can risk. Money comes and goes and while it sucks to lose it, there are things that are much more important.

				Yeah thats the risk you take.....pay through the nose for domestic with little or no risk or buy international at lower prices and run the gauntlet.

				As BlackIris said, don&#039;t search too hard (through the clearnet, etc). All you can really do is wait and not sign for anything that does arrive. Also, say it does arrive, don&#039;t open it for a while to be safe.
