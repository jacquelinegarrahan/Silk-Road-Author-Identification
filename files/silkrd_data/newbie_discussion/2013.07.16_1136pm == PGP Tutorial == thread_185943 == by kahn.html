				This is for the Windows family of OS and best of all it is free.&nbsp; Go here:&nbsp; &nbsp;( http://www.gpg4win.org/ )<br />If you&#039;re using Windows, this is the best way ( I think ) to go.<br /><br />Learning to use PGP is not easy for everyone. I know. I pulled my hair out trying to figure it out. I finally hit on:<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tim_Starling/Gpg4win_tutorial.<br /><br />This helped me to finally understand its basic function. At least enough to use it here. If you&#039;re having problems try this out...<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br />kahn<br /><br />

Just my copy and paste error or using a period at the end of a sentence. Either way, thank you. I just hope no one else spent any substantial time trying to get to the link and found my error to be an empediment. It really is a good tutorial, coupled with the Gpg4win Compendium attached to the Gpg4win download it answers most of the questions new users have.<br /><br />As far as 3072-bit encryption vs.4096-bit, while one is certainly more secure, we&#039;re using it for message and address comms., not national security. I am in no way trivializing your statement, just trying to help someone that&#039;s not familiar with PGP at all get started. If everyone here would take the time to help someone else here, I know the site would grow even more. I would love to see a day when LE just said &quot;Fuck it, we simply do not have the resources to fight it any longer.&quot; <br />I know that&#039;s a dream, but 45 years ago sitting around smoking Mexican dirt weed, I distinctly remember saying, &quot;I would love to live long&nbsp; &nbsp;enough, one of these days, to see the day when you could walk into the store and say, &#039;I think I want to try some of the Columbian Gold, I&#039;m tired of the Panama Red.&#039; &quot;&nbsp; We call them &quot;Medical Marijuana Dispensaries&quot;&nbsp; now and the brand names have changed, but they&#039;re still a store, and I&#039;m still alive. We can dream...<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br />kahn
