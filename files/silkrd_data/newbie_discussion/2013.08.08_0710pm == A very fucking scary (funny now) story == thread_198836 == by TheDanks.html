				so me and my buddies (J and K) were just sitting around at his place watching some Men In Black, eating some fucking dank pizza, when he asks if we want some booms. Now, Ive done my share of awesome mushrooms, but they were all from my town, never had any from here. So we end up getting a dub of some straight up mushrooms and splitting it between two people. THEN we get a mushroom patty (like a giant tootsie roll) and split that. Then J buys another G of shrooms for us to munch on. I had no idea how crazy this day was going to end up being. So we all start getting the tingly body high and decide its time to walk around town, maybe head down to the skatepark and shit. Were there, just trippin out at everything, looking at the clouds swirl, some tourists are just pointing and laughing at us cause were all so damn trippy. I keep on peaking, and we decide to go down to my friends &quot;house&quot;. I say &quot;house&quot; cause he doesnt reallly own it anymore, we just been drinking and fuckin mad bitches there. So we head down and he aint home, so we decide to just crawl in thru the window (big mistake). My friend J was already drunk, and me and K were buzzin so we started drinkin some leftover PBRs and then he decides to hit up a lady-friend so she can bring her hookah over and smoke. We wanted to smoke cause we were trippin so we said why not. They come over and we&#039;re all having fun, bumpin to music, laughing, and of course tripping my face off. I mean so hard, harder than I really expected. I go into the smoke room to burn one cause I found a cig leftover, and I hear some heavy pounding at the door. At first I think its J just messing with me<br /><br />Then I realize this isn&#039;t J<br /><br />BOOM BOOM BOOM &quot;SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT OPEN THE DOOR&quot;<br /><br />I turned and ran over to the window in his room to jump out, and there is a cop with the scariest look on his face I have ever seen. I thought he was going to murder me, and in this deep satanic voice he says &quot;get out here you son of a bitch&quot; and lunges in to grab my arm<br /><br />I turn around to a cop grabbing me and throwing me down on the ground, cuffing my hands and screaming not to move. I dont remember the next 5 minutes but I came to on the floor, handcuffed, staring at my friend K into his eyes with nothing but pupil, no color, and thinking I was gonna die. The floor was rolling like waves, the walls were closing in on me, and there was a table moving around the room. Plus the cops looked like looney toons (excpet the cop that lunged at me, he looked like satan)<br /><br />So they start taking us out one by one, through this house full of weed, alcohol, beers, panties and bras, pipes and bongs. They have no idea we are trippin balls.<br /><br />2 miracles happened next<br /><br />before I tell you Ill remind you that if I get any single charge or trouble at all its JDC for 6 months to a year...I was scared<br /><br />So I was fairly drunk, tipsy at the least....and I blew a .000<br /><br />Dont ask me how, its magic (mushrooms)<br /><br />Then he ran my name for probation in both my state and the state I was in<br /><br />Im on probabtion in both<br /><br />It came back clean<br /><br />he said &quot;son your free to go&quot; and&nbsp; I shook his hand and said thanks as his face was swirling and melting<br /><br />Crazy. fucking. shit

				Lucky, lucky, lucky! How&#039;d you manage to keep chill while they were sobriety testing you and running your name? I&#039;m pretty sure I wouldn&#039;t be able to keep a straight face/not come off obviously fucked up on that much mushies. More power to you, man.
