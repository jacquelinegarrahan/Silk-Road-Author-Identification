				Mountain hiking. Also, with certain drugs you can modify the high if you take a moment to meditate. So you can have moments where you are on a certain meditation high while on the drug high.

				DZ = Drop Zone.<br />It&#039;s a skydiving thing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=156868.msg1100043#msg1100043">Quote from: Iliveinthekhole on May 07, 2013, 11:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No one at my DZ does it but me ... kinda feel left out lol, what about you guys?

So when I took my AFF (accelerated free fall) course I&nbsp; was pretty much stoned on painkillers and/or weed from the first day of class through my B certificate.<br />Most everyone at my DZ would hit the J around the campfire after a day of jumping, and I smoked with people on days the weather kept us grounded. But as laid back as my DZ was, pre flight smoking was always frowned upon... In hindsight I probably should have left the buds for after jumping too. At least until I reached 400 jumps and was a total skygod!

				I&#039;ve always been extremely interested in skydiving. I have friends that tell me how amazing it is. I have been curious re: the usage on the courses &amp; the overall experience. I&#039;m not a huge smoker, but I can&#039;t imagine the altitude wouldn&#039;t make an enjoyable buzz by itself... add in a mild opiate buzz, at least in my head it sounds fun. Does it take away from the experience or add to it?<br /><br />I had a friend who popped a blotter or two before a couple of jumps and seemed to enjoy that thoroughly, but I haven&#039;t actively considered many of his decisions as particularly wise to begin with... lol.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking at going for a course this summer, soon as I figure out where my ass is gonna plant for a while when I leave my current habitat. Any advice?

Any advice?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In order to jump solo you need to take one of a number of courses that if you pass will qualify you for an A license. <br />The courses I&#039;m familiar with are AFF (Accelerated Free Fall) You get around 12 hours of classroom work with tests. Then you&#039;ll make 25 pass/fail jumps with an instructor close by to get your A.<br />There&#039;s Tandem Progression. Were you make 2-5 tandem jumps then 20 pass/fail solo jumps with an instructor near by.<br />Lastly there&#039;s Static Line Progression. You get a couple hours of classroom then they shove you out of a plane (usually a shitty one) 15 (or so) times with a lanyard that deploys your chute upon line stretch. After each jump they give you a little more slack . But you get the least amount of freefall time with static line.<br />If you&#039;re just going for the experience (or want to see if you like it) I&#039;d recommend doing a tandem jump.&nbsp; That&#039;s the way most people experience skydiving.<br />You get 30 minutes of classroom and then you jump with an instructor strapped to your back. <br />I&#039;ve never done a tandem, but I imagine you still get the &#039;rush&#039; and in hindsight I&#039;d probably do one or two just to get over the sensory overload you get on the first couple of jumps. You literally can&#039;t move for a couple of seconds, then when you can the first thought that comes to mind is to curl up in a ball and kiss your ass goodbye. <br />It&#039;s an amazing feeling. To know that you&#039;re going to be dead in a matter of seconds... unless you do something about it.
