				Blockchain.info should have options for UK buyers as well so everything you need will be on that site.<br /><br />

				Just let me know if you need more help afterwords. I checked the UK deposit options and they all seem to be bank oriented. I know some people are sketched about that but remember bitcoin is legal to buy and have.<br /><br />If you want to help make sure your coin is untraceable some people prefer to tumble them around some useless wallets before moving them to SR (pass them to another wallet then delete the wallet).<br /><br />If none of those options work we will try to find you something else that works.

				localbitcoins.com is also worth a look in the UK. Prices vary, as does the quality of the vendors (by feedback), but you can usually find something decent. if not just wait listings come and go all the time. The &#039;online&#039; ones will usually want a direct bank transfer, or some you can meet in person if you want to do that.

				Thanks for the info.<br /><br />Tried chainblock but same problem. I have no problem buying them with a bank account but... specifically need a site that will accept a Republic of Ireland Bank account. I feel dodgy posting that but I cant find a site anywhere. It&#039;s all USD and GBP.

				Ireland is in SEPA and you have euros if i recall correctly, so I recommend bitstamp.net.<br />If you do a SEPA bank transfer there, the fees are almost zero and very fast.

				I used to transfer money from a UK bank account to mt.gox, but they have since closed their UK bank account. I now use blockchain.info. They accept the &quot;faster payment&quot; system used in the UK which is quite useful. <br /><br />If you&#039;re in the US you can pay with cash. <br /><br />There are also sellers on silk road that will pay bitcoins for cash.

				A couple of vendors sell coins on the road.<br /><br />You transfer money in to their account, or pay it in at a branch with a reference and then they send the coins to your account on the road.

				I think MTGOX and BitStamp have SEPA wires or whatever it is in Europe<br /><br />Nothing illegal about having BTC, plenty of legal business behind them!
