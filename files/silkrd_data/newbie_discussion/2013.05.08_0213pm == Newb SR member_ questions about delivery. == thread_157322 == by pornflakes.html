				Hi, I&#039;m a new SR member from Romania, contemplating on making my first order. The backstory is that I got tired of shitty costumer service with local dealers and products of uncertain quality or origin. I did my research on how to place an order and receive it, but I&#039;m not quite sure how this would work in my country.<br /><br />In my case I want to buy a small quantity 5-10g of weed, unfortunately not domestic, only EU, and was wondering how I will get hold of the package. Will it be sent through the Romanian Postal service, and if so will it be in an envelope sent directly to my mailbox or in a parcel? If it&#039;s the latter I would have to go to my post office and pick it up from the post office desk, and I feel slightly reluctant towards picking up a package of controlled substances in person. Any experiences or advice?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

				It can vary from vendor to vendor! Everything i have got has come in an envelope straight through the door with no need for signature and i believe most vendors send small packages this way. With weed you might want to check the vendors reviews to see what people say about the stealth of the package. With weed stealth is a lot harder than most other stuff and a lazy vendor could get you in trouble if the smell comes through the envelope!

				I agree with Loves2Trip it depends on the seller but it usually tells you on the page the postage options the UK vendors i,ve dealt with have very good packaging double or treble sealed don,t want to go into too much detail but always been very well packed in saying that i live in UK but i ordered from czech vendor recently and i did not recieve not the vendors fault just unlucky but i,ll be staying with UK vendors now&nbsp; :)

				I feel a lot better now that you reassured me. Thanks. Nonetheless I&#039;m planning on ordering from a reputable EU vendor, so I reckon he knows how to deliver stealthily.&nbsp; Also, from what I&#039;ve read on the forums, I&#039;m certainly not the first to order weed/hash in Romania, let alone small amounts.

				You should be alright with such a small quantity.&nbsp; Just stay safe and be vigilant.
