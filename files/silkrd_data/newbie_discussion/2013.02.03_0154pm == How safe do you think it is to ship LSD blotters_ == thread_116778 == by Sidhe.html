				If the blotters are just white paper... Is it as safe as sending/receiving a letter?

				Well, Yes and No. They are probably the easiest thing as they are just paper as you said so you can hide them very easily compared to bud which is bigger etc. But blotters need to be kept in dark avergaeish sorta conditions, Im not sure exactly what i cant remember but just search the forums for how to store LSD or something and you&#039;l be fine. So light through a light envelope might damage them and half the potency. <br />Dogs might be able to smell them, Probably still requires stealth. <br />And then you have to think of accidental openings or whatever.

				Hmm. Maybe if the vendor wrapped the blotters in dark coloured paper it would have less of a chance of being exposed to light. Also I&#039;ve always heard that as long as you store LSD in a freezer it won&#039;t expire.

				LSD and NBOME are probably the safest thing to ship, i&#039;ve made regular orders of large quantities to Australia from the Netherlands and Canada without any problems.

I wont go into detail on how it was packaged, but it sure was good enough for a single tab. Could&#039;ve even send me up to 25 tabs this way, but orders over that should have better/different packaging.<br />He doesn&#039;t have a link to a topic on his vendor page though. But the acid was cheap and good :D

				+1 to AussieMitch, nice to see a newbie make some sense today!<br /><br />You could order a thousand blotters, then thousand, and still get em all. <br /><br />Acid is odorless, it is laid out on paper, you could even have acid laid on any paper you care for, on a sweet spot on a greeting card, for example.<br /><br />But back to good ol SR blotter. <br /><br />They&#039;d have to actually have a good reason to a) intercept b) open your letter to actually see the tabs. Even with x-ray, they&#039;d have to *really* be focused, and then, they&#039;d need a good reason to pick your letter out of millions to xray in the first place.<br /><br />You have better odds winning the mega-jackpot in the lottery than being caught buying acid or nbomb on the road.<br /><br />don&#039;t worry be droppin&#039;. :)<br /><br />
