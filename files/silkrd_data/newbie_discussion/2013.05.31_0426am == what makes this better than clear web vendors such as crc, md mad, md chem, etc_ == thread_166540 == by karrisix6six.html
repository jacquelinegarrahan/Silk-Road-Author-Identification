				I don&#039;t know what you mean by clear web - it&#039;s certainly not a technical term. <br />Bitcoins are what makes it difficult to pay but also far more anonymous and totally essential here. <br />The quality from here is absolutely excellent in all cases that I&#039;ve tried anything. Check out your vendor&#039;s feedback to see what other people are thinking.

				that is not how it usually it is, sometimes the newb forums get spammed, but the mods do a good job of cleaning it up quick.&nbsp; as for why this is better than clearweb vendors..<br /><br />well, first of all, the &quot;difficult&quot; payment method yr talking about is highly secure and much more difficult to trace than you just paypaling someone or some shit.&nbsp; it&#039;s also really not that difficult, at all.&nbsp; bitcoins are easier to acquire right now then they have been in a long, long time, do some research and find the way that suits you best.&nbsp; &nbsp;also the bust rate is not higher at all, and tbh the only time i was ever scammed out of money was by a clearweb vendor.&nbsp; and all the sites you&#039;re listing just sell RC&#039;s.. silk road sells everything.&nbsp; and there is a feedback system in place that, if you can learn to navigate it and be smart, really does help with any &quot;quality assurance&quot; issues.&nbsp; beyond that, it&#039;s just a bad idea to use clearweb.. anyone remember operation webtryp??&nbsp; yeah, thats why you don&#039;t use clearweb..<br /><br />if the combination of security, stability and reliability that SR offers isn&#039;t enough to convince you, then go ahead and order off the clearweb.&nbsp; but when used in combination with the forums and some common sense, i really don&#039;t think there&#039;s any safer way to get drugs than through the road.&nbsp; maybe read the wiki and it can help shed some light on why we all make the decision to use it.&nbsp;

				Well it&#039;s basically impossible to track a vendor down without ordering from them and reversing the address and then lying in wait for someone to post something!

				The Road will reward those who take the time to figure out how it all works. It&#039;s easy to glance over this stuff, be totally overwhelmed, leave and never come back and write it off as &quot;some crazy shit&quot; that a lot of people get scammed for trying, but actually ... this &quot;community&quot; is the closest thing to a free and open society I&#039;ve ever experienced. <br /><br />It&#039;s truly genius the way this place operates, but let me break down a few keys points why this would be better than &#039;clearnet&#039;.<br /><br />This is an .onion site accessed using Tor. The entire shit is encrypted and LE has no idea who the fuck you are or any hope of ever finding out by watching IPs or monitoring the traffic on this site in any way, as long as you use Tor and this website. Number one.<br /><br />As mentioned, the &quot;difficult&quot; currency you refer to is difficult for a reason, but really, it&#039;s not that difficult, more or less so depending on where you are in the world. This currency cannot be tracked. So there&#039;s two monumental reasons why this would be better. Nothing about your internet activity or finances will be traceable (if done right .. which isn&#039;t that hard).<br /><br />Whoever told you the bust rate is higher was wrong. There is no bust rate. There&#039;s actually never been a bust, ever. So SR has everyone else licked in the dept. The only busts that have happened involving people selling drugs on SR were people who were running sloppy operations and got noticed by local police, who then busted them and made the link to SR. It had nothing to do with uncovering peoples identities through the website. (**edit: I guess you were probably talking about the customer end of things. That is a risk we all take, and does happen, but you wouldn&#039;t be any safer in that sense ordering from clearnet, and any reputable vendor on SR takes great pride in their stealth packaging).<br /><br />Being anonymous is simply a matter of linkability, to take a page out of pine&#039;s book. There is a community here. People make up nicknames but come in here with a personality. People within the community can build reputations, and be known for one thing or another, whether it be good or bad, and as long as none of this can be tied to any real people in real life, we have a community full of people with personality and reputation, and we&#039;re still all anonymous!<br /><br />It is the community that runs this place, and the vendors know it. If you&#039;re worried about being scammed, just go to the vendors page. Look at his feedback. If you see that 3-5 people received orders from that vendor that day, they all left 5/5 and said things like &quot;great stealth&quot; &quot;smooth transaction&quot; &quot;great vendor&quot; etc etc. and see the same thing happened the day before. And the day before that. You can be pretty damn confident in assuming that they&#039;re not going to randomly decide to scam you for 100 bucks worth of illicit material. <br /><br />Really though, it&#039;s all there for you to discover.<br />Like I said ... The Road WILL reward the willing.<br /><br />SR staff, DPR, have taken many measures to protect everyone involved, and IMO are doing a great job.<br />20+ transactions to date. Not a scam, not a hitch.<br />Just gotta know how to travel The Road :D<br />
