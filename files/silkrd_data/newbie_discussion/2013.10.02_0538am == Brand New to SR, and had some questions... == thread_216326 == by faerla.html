				I&#039;m interested in selling some of my Adderall on SR, but I have no idea where to begin. I&#039;ve read through the Seller&#039;s Guide, but it doesn&#039;t really help me with how I&#039;m supposed to get the tabs from me to buyer...<br />Also, how does the whole buying and selling process work? The bullet points that I read were somewhat confusing...<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />~Faerla

				well - to open a vendor account you will have to lay about 500$ as a bond on the table, So it might not be worth it for your purposes.<br /><br />Honestly, I think the wiki pretty much covered everything you need to know.

				Well the first thing you have to do is put up a 3.75 bit coin deposit. You put that in the account and then convert to a vendor with it. After that it&#039;s very similar to EBay.

				I think its self explanatory, you have to pay the vendor bond which is 500$ and you will get it back once you have done 35 transactions and atleast a total of 1500$ or more ( not sure about the amount ). And then you get access to the vendors board in the forums which only vendors have access. Silkroad its like ebay , you get to post listings and people buy it..
