				Hello all, This newbie board is bullshit in my opinion, but the people who come here should know about this great vendor as well. Not too long ago, I purchased a 10 strip of LSD from Tessellated, and it arrived in about a week in packaging so good I had trouble finding it. After waiting for 2 days, it was time. <br /><br />At about noon, I dropped 3 tabs of his 200 mic tabs. I was expecting to trip dicks, but I could not have possibly expected the trip I got. Within only 20 minutes, the tight and almost anxious feeling in my chest began which is one way I usually tell if my shit has kicked in. I tried listening to the album I had listened to last time I used acid, but then I did not have acid that was as good quality as I had this time. The music scared me, but in a good way. I decided to put on some more uplifting tunes, and after laying in my bed having my existence dismantled for about 2 hours straight to divine music, I hit up my friend who I will refer to as A. <br /><br />I texted A and asked him if he was down to smoke some weed. He came in his car to my house to pick me up, but I was unable to find his car. I was roaming in the middle of my street, looking around in cirlces searching for his car. I finally called him, asking where he was. It turned out that he was about 7 yards down the street. As we drove around, the cars no longer looked like normal everyday car. Every car was breathing as it was moving, and was the size of a clown car. I felt as if we were on a gameboard, just a piece of board game. While this not amused me, it kind of frightened me as well. Eventually I had my friend drop me back home because I was just tripping to hard to socialize<br /><br />Once I was home, I lied on my bed, just staring at the ceiling deeper in thought than I had ever been before. I remembered back to moments in my childhood, significant and critical moments that shaped me as a human being. I rolled around in my bed for hours, every nerve of my body sending messages of pleasure to my brain. I felt so happy, but so vulnerable. I tripped until late at night, until about 3 in the morning. Every hour was one of the best of my life, I refuse to buy LSD from anyone else on the road after my experience. I highly recommend you take your psychedelic business to Tessellated, you won&#039;t be sorry in the slightest.

				Thanks for the review...&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I placed my first SR order last week for 10 hits from Tess.&nbsp; It&#039;s currently in transit and I&#039;ve been really happy with the process so far.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be my first time trying LSD so my plan is to test trip with one tab.&nbsp; I definitely won&#039;t be taking three tabs... ha ha... It sounds like you had an extraordinary experience though!

				Tessellated&#039;s WoW LSD is amazing! Clean, potent, and wonderful experience. Great communication, stellar speed and stealth, and a great business experience. The first trip was great! 200 ug for me and 150 ug for my girlfriend. The trip was beautiful and very productive. I gained a newfound appreciation for the beauty of the world and better understood my girlfriend&#039;s mind and psychosis, and reminded myself of my purpose in life. We grew even closer together, and conquered her eating disorder! It was a great experience. Taxing, but fun and beautiful. We&#039;re going to wait a while before visiting Lucy again because it&#039;s a really special and intimate experience, but we just bought another ten strip to keep for the future. Definitely recommend doing business with Tess! Will buy again. Can&#039;t recommend his product enough. My girlfriend agrees wholeheartedly. Recommending to all my friends!

				That is fucking awesome.&nbsp; I would like to try some of tess&#039;s L, but I can&#039;t bring myself to invest with so much on my hands!<br /><br />LSD is by far the most amazing drug you will ever experience.&nbsp; I think it is best explored with beautiful music.&nbsp; You should check out Bluetech and OTT.<br /><br />Next time you trip you should really prepare yourself.&nbsp; Make sure that you are 100% free of ALL stress.&nbsp; Take the time to do a good amount of exercise prior to the trip (like running every other day for a month prior).&nbsp; Ensure you don&#039;t owe anyone money, aren&#039;t worried about the police, don&#039;t have any relationship issues, and most certainly make sure that nothing will be planned for the day!!!!&nbsp; Glad you got the chance to explore your soul my friend!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				Great trip report! I took 3 on good Friday, and it was pretty extreme. I usually take 1, sometime 2 but only once did I do 3.

				I agree this Newbie board is ridiculous. I switched PC the same time it was introduced, and have just assumed for the last six months that the SR forums didn&#039;t work on 64 bit Windows! It literally took me several hours today to work out I could only post in a Newbie board.<br /><br />Tessellated failed to deliver to Aus (10-strip). I have had dodgy meth letters come through, so I suspect I have been selectively scammed by Tessellated.

				Cool idea to post this thread on newbie board. Tess&#039; reputation def. precedes him/her. I ordered 10 tabs, which got lost over Memorial Day holiday. I still gave a full 5/5 feedback, however, due to Tess&#039; stellar communication thru the whole process, and a 50% refund (which is the most fair way to be handled on both sides). I will be attempting another buy with an alternate address soon. Can&#039;t wait to finally be able to try this stuff :)

You think I am going to scam you over 10 little hits? You do know that your country&#039;s customs are the worst out there right? Lay off the meth man, it is affecting your judgement.<br /><br />Once we have this worked out you can order from someone else in the future because I don&#039;t need customers that talk shit in public without even first trying to work it out.

				Our customs are over-rated. I recently had a letter come through quick that literally had crystal meth floating around inside, and the letter itself was dodgy. If an Aussie claims your product didn&#039;t come through and you sent it, they&#039;re probably scamming you. The only issue in my experience is that Customs are good at spotting fake names; I order lots of decoy packages from every country I use.<br />Tessellated, you&#039;re either trying to make an example of me because you&#039;re a selective con-artist, or you simply don&#039;t realise how many dodgy vendors are on here. Especially if you deal with meth like I do. The dodgy vendors are the same people as the dodgy customers, so you shouldn&#039;t think in terms of vendors vs. customers.<br />I have reduced my feedback from 4/5 to 1/5.

				Ya okay Electro make your feedback anything you like. I can&#039;t please people who don&#039;t even try to work things out. I hope other vendors are looking at the way you act thought.<br /><br />You are one of the reasons many vendors refuse to deal with Oz. Damn fool thinks I would burn him over 10 hits. Lay off the meth.

				WTF Electrofermion, if you think I am scamming you then why did you order again 2 days ago? Are you just trying to punk my feedback now? Now I think you are outright lying.<br /><br />You are now spending money to fuck me over so now I am thinking you are not just some meth-head, but instead are targeting me. You clearly have a budget to damage my reputation. I don&#039;t think you are some ignorant customer, I think you set out from the beginning to harm my reputation. My real customers will see through this transparent shit.<br /><br />I sent your order, didn&#039;t notice your name. I will watch more careful to cancel every order you make, I advise other vendors to do the same.

				I&#039;ve got a new address for the new order; If it doesn&#039;t come through, then I know you&#039;re a scammer. There was an Aussie LSD dealer, EnterTheMatrix, who was full of crap and went rogue with everyone&#039;s money. So only a naive fool would especially trust you LSD vendors.

				So, I ordered some of Tess&#039; tabs for my friend for his trip to electric forest. He&#039;s a big guy who usually does a lot, and has had good lsd in the past, but he took 3 hits and it knocked him on his ass (in a great way). He said he and his friend couldn&#039;t find their way on a straight path, and once they finally did, the stage was melting in front of his eyes. He can&#039;t wait to do it again for our trip to global at Red Rocks. He said it was beyond the best stuff he&#039;d ever tried.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;ve done some RC&#039;s and shrooms, but had never tried lsd. My friends told me that it would be nothing like anything I&#039;d ever done. I went to EDC las vegas the weekend I got it, and convinced my friend who had only tripped once on 25i (and had a very intense trip) to do it with me the second night. We took half a tab each to start, knowing the tabs had high ug&#039;s. Once we got through security and into the festival, we decided to get on the ferris wheel. We took another half tab each about 30 minutes after the first, and once we got to the top the lights were bright and beautiful. Everything was so sharp and clear, I felt like I was seeing colors I&#039;d never seen before.<br />When we got into the dome stage, Cosmic Grounds, I was having a fantastic time. I would close my eyes and have bright rainbow visuals of people and lights dancing in my head. Much like my previous trips, every second felt different, but unlike my other trips, every second felt even better than the previous one. I was on top of the world, and I felt like I finally understood this crazy rave culture that surrounded me in a way that I never had before, even on the best nights of my life.<br /><br />Needless to say, I&#039;ve ordered more. Never going back :)

				I made the second order from you, Tessellated, before I even posted on here. I don&#039;t think you&#039;re a scammer; it is merely a suspicion.
