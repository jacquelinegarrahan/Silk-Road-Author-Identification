And like it&#039;s been stated in another thread, SilkRoad is only 0.007% of the worlds who drug trade. <br /><br />Which seems minuscule when it is probably the same people behind 20%-30% and the money can go to catching them. <br /><br />

				My job is a computing scientist, I specialise in cryptography and security systems (that&#039;s narrowed my identity down too much OH NO! lol)<br />and let me reassure some people. The current method of routing used by &#039;the internet&#039; (techies I apologise for the use of that) renders it<br />impossible to look back more than say, a week tops at traceroutes before they are totally useless.<br /><br />If you are going to get caught on this site it is through phishing and your own fault by giving up info about yourself freely (anyone makes a joke about my job above... just don&#039;t lol).<br /><br />It IS possible of course, to shut down the SR, but it isn&#039;t through some uninvented technology.

				I don&#039;t foresee SR going down anytime soon. Way too secure, especially if everyone uses PGPs like they should. If it does go down, you better believe another website will take it&#039;s place. Time will tell. Unfortunately journalism and news stations have brought Way to much public light to the website, which essentially ruins the underground aspect of all of it and could result in eventually the government or whoever being able to actually break into such a well made program.

				I&#039;d say much of the internet traffic in the USA is already being monitored.&nbsp; This includes TOR.&nbsp; I forget who, it was not Keith.&nbsp; But, an analysis at the NSA once remarked, &quot;With the right people, technology &amp; money - There is nothing we can not do&quot;.&nbsp; While quantum encryption is no where near yet.&nbsp; The few labs who have such setups...&nbsp; It has been cracked via man in the middle attacks.<br /><br />Like any busts in the past: Hive, SC, Russian CC sites, RMJCC.....&nbsp; All it takes is one person to make 3-4 mistakes or 3-4 people to make 1 mistake.&nbsp; Whomever, there are thousands of examples.&nbsp; We saw what Stuxnet did the work on that began in 2005.&nbsp; Project Aurora too 0days were horded for years on both.&nbsp; Though I do not think SR is a hot enough AO.&nbsp; There are lots of relevant people fighting legalizing drugs.&nbsp; Relevant to LE/IC there are much more important things going on in the world too.<br /><br />However, with a few million... Or billion in some cases and the right people....&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy/Security is a myth.&nbsp; Hell 1/1,000 or less of that budget folks at Grr, Def, Schmoo, CCC and other cons have clearly demonstrated this is true as well.<br /><br />It is a serious security risk.&nbsp; However, for now it is a risk worth it to many.

				A few things worth reminding :<br /><br />1) If anybody tells you his server and it&#039;s content is 100% secured. They ARE lying. There is no such thing as &quot;unbeatable&quot; or &quot;unhackable&quot;<br /><br />2) Tor is not THAT much secure. As far as i know, exit nodes are still a big risk. If you create a fake exit node and monitor it&#039;s whole traffic there is a high chance you will get some interesting data. I have no idea if there is some of these fake nodes, but they are dangerous. The content is not encrypted between the Tor exit node and the server. Well at least that&#039;s true for clearnet sites but I think it&#039;s also true for .onion sites (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong on this).<br /><br />3) It&#039;s insanely hard to keep confidential data secured, and it&#039;s even more true when this content is illegal. SR must have a small (but experienced) team and it must be very hard to keep an eye on recent 0 days or intrusion attempts. If one day someone ever gets some data from SR, it would most certainly be encrypted. Then the quality of the encryption will define how long and how expensive it will be to decode. No encryption mechanism is fail-proof either. A simple brute-force attack theoretically could let you decrypt anything you want (except maybe a weird homemade cypher).<br /><br />We have seen in the past some truecrypt containers beat the FBI processing power for brute force. So it&#039;s achievable to make something very hard to decode as long as the key is long enough (and has good entropy) and as long as the cypher is known to be reliable.

				It seems, all those image hosts and CP servers on the so called dark net and TOR have gotten busted somehow.&nbsp; You got to wonder how anonymous TOR is for people/servers who are on constantly.&nbsp; At some point they loose their secret location. <br /><br />SR is waaaaay ahead of all that though.<br /><br />This does only represent a small piece of he bigger picture of drug dealing out there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Drugs have been sent through thesis for the past 20 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gangs do it all the time and have their own strategies.z<br /><br />I wish someone would list some diamonds from Africa so we can import them through the mail and resell them.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Internet bringsmproe together and new world wide contacts for drugs and contraband.&nbsp; It&#039;s a great time to be alive right now. .&nbsp;
