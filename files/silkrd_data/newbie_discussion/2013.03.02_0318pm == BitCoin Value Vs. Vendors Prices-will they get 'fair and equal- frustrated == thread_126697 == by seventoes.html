				HI---yes newbie here and this may be more stupid newbie rantings but its killing me—financially.&nbsp; I need&nbsp; to know if there is any relief in sight.&nbsp; I was so happy and excited to find SR--although it was very expensive, I desperately needed to replace the 40mg metha a day for chronic pain I&#039;d been taking for last 3 years and I was/AND STILL AM, dying to get a fabulous high from some H.&nbsp; So I accepted the 19.00 dollar BTC price for the privileges and I got 5 BTC (not nearly enough) and started my cart.&nbsp; I found a somewhat decent price for my metha pills week one, but lost him after a week. Following week need more coins which I had to pay $8 now.&nbsp; I’m watching vendors and items closely and I notice that some vendors prices are going up slightly instead of down.&nbsp; Makes me frustrated and&nbsp; I still haven’t found the excellent H.&nbsp; Surely prices will get in line with the BTC and come down soon?&nbsp; I’m still looking for a permanent supplier and/or a comparable replacement product (AND&nbsp; H!)&nbsp; Now I need more BTC and this time they are over $35 A BTC…the price has almost doubled now over the course of the month! When are the vendor prices going lower??&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent well over 700 so far, couple more in escrow, and none of the Vendors I&#039;ve been watching, waiting for their prices to drop, have dropped anything.&nbsp; I notice many vendor prices are higher in BTC , which don’t match the dollar pricing or verbage.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some say&nbsp; (EX) &quot;selling at 20 a piece..best price around&quot; etc, only they are NOT at that price or near it.&nbsp; I&#039;m paying 35 a BTC because that’s the value now—When will they?&nbsp; WILL THE VENDORS&nbsp; LOWER PRICES&nbsp; and help the buyers with real time pricing?&nbsp; It makes me feel bad because the price is already too high.&nbsp; How long will it take? (and still looking for killer H0

				I am sorry to hear about your frustration man, BTC&#039;s stability was like the beginning of a roller coaster last month,&nbsp; way more unstable than it usually is (having said that it is still pretty unstable for a currency). Although I think you will find given a closer look that most vendors peg there pricing to the USD not BTC, so the prices are adjusted automatically.<br />I hope you find the right vendor/s that you are looking for.
