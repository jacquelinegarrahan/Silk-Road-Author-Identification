				Hi!<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for some *clean* LSD and am considering either FartBomber&#039;s blotters (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/7cb0c6fa91) or Tessellated&#039;s (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/072149359c) - I have a rather good feeling about Tess blotters but FartBomber&#039;s are really cheaper..<br /><br />I&#039;d like to know if anyone here did try both, and could tell me which one s/he felt like was the purest?<br /><br />If from what I did read it seems like Tess blotters are really clean, I did read some mixed review about the Freddy Cats..<br /><br />Anyone here with an experience of both? <br /><br />If you consider I&#039;d rather consider another vendor, please feel free to tell me his/her name!<br /><br />Thanks :-)

				I actually just got some liquid from JesusofRave the other day. I wont be eating it for a week or two but the reviews are extremely positive. I am excited to eat it and have no doubt it will be top quality.

As I&#039;m looking for as-pure-as-possible LSD, I might rather get something else..<br /><br />Maybe Tessellated is my best bet currently, or JoR liquid... Indica9 say they have really pure/strong swiss stuff, waiting for a trip report, but it can be interesting, though it&#039;s rather expensive.<br /><br />Did you guys try JoR Mayas? They seem rather good too..<br /><br />Nice day to every one :)

				I hear JORs liquid is unbelievable, but I haven&#039;t tried myself to attest to that. I have tried Tessellated blotters though and it was a very great experience, definitely dosed well.

				Fat Freddy&#039;s Cat from FartBomber or White label from Tessellated... I got both lying around here somewhere, but can&#039;t say anything about the purity yet...<br />some of JoR&#039;s vials ended up in my freezer, but can&#039;t say how pure that&#039;s gone be either (not yet)...<br /><br />but I can say that Albert Hoffman 1943 has great stuff, very very pure and nice<br /><br />and Indica9 seems to be selling some 300ug needlepoint blotters (but there are no reports yet on those blotters)... <br /><br />I&#039;d go for the vials (if still available), or maybe some of Indica9&#039;s 300ug, <br />but many other options are open (I love options!)...<br />the Fat Cat is tempting and Tess&#039;tabs have many fans... <br /><br />edit: if you want liquid but found JoR out of supply, you might want to wait a few weeks (at least 3) to order some of his new batch... we&#039;ve been waiting for his &quot;The Christ Resurection&quot; for months now and it&#039;s been said it would probably be even more pure than his actual/previous batch of &quot;The Original Christ&quot;...
