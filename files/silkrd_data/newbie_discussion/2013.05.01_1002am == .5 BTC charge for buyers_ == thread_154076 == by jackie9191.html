				SR comes back up, no idea or any explanation of why it was down for 3 days, and then in my mailbox is a message from Admin saying buyers have to post .5 BTC fee due to too many scammers. The message clearly was written by someone who speaks English as a second language. What is going on? Is this fee for real? If a moderator or long time member could clear this up for me I would be very grateful. I want to stay on SR but this is kind of weird lately. I tried Atlantis and BMR during the last 3 days and wasn&#039;t impressed. I sent 3 vendors messages and didn&#039;t get an answer. I placed an order and after 36 hours it still hasn&#039;t been processed. I hope SR is OK and things are back to normal here.

				Come on, there&#039;s no way they would ask for a fee in that manner. SR already receives a commission for each product sold and if they wanted more they would just increase the fee via that mechanism. Your product may have been processed but the vender hasn&#039;t verified it due to the site being down, or alternatively he or she couldn&#039;t access the site to see what had been ordered.

				First of all calm down...&nbsp; The road has been getting DDOS&#039;ed for the second time this month for the past 3 days and DPR just got it running again 3-4hours ago.. So this means NO ONE has been able to get on the road at all not even vendors. Watch your stuff today im sure your vendor will be online within the next day and a half, remember they sleep at different times than you do!<br /><br />In addition&nbsp; NO ONE will ever send you a private message asking for money.. They are clearly trying to scam you.. <br /><br />And seeing as someone was able to message you in the road tells me your forum account maybe the same user name as your SR account which is VERY unwise.&nbsp; Have a nice evening

I was actually talking about not hearing back from vendors on BMR and Atlantis! I went on there while SR was down and had terrible comms so I am glad to see SR back up because the vendors here are very responsive and dependable. I don&#039;t want to have to do business on BMR or Atlantis, but if that is all that is available.......<br />I will work on how I word my posts, clearly I screwed the pooch on this one.

				didnt see you mention atlantis or BMR.. yeah dont use them they suck egg&#039;s&nbsp; SR charges high fees to their sellers but hey! who care when you get premium service !&nbsp; <br /><br />If the road stays steady and this hacker gives up you can expect things to normalize within the week. <br />Keep in mind some vendors may take longer than others as events like this do spook them.

				This is another reason SR is best, you get good advice from good people. I&#039;m sure some of them got spooked, totally get that. But glad business is back.
