				hey<br />wanting to get a sense of how many buyers have successfully had their parcels arrive in from the UK in the past 3 months.<br />I&#039;ve had 100% success.<br />What has your experience been like and do you believe Aus customs getting tighter with security?

				my experience from the UK has been solid and my last purchase was around May this year. I&#039;m waiting on a new order made a week ago, same vendor/country and had heard our customs had tightened security. Hoping that it was just rumors.<br />I&#039;ve also been looking at alternative sites since the demise of DPR and the road, and think BMR/Sheep should work out just as good.<br />We&#039;re human. We&#039;ll adapt. It&#039;s our nature :)

				Never had any trouble at all... To the point i&#039;d be making 5-6 orders a week and have them come on consecutive days or two at a time.... Once its past the border, no one @ auspost is gonna give a shit... Its all in the packaging...........
