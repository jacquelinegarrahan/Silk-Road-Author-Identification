				Interesting. What do you think of Methyl compared to MDMA? I was using a shady dealer in my city and I was pretty sure he was cutting his MDMA with it or some other analogue. I&#039;m a fan of Meph and I&#039;ve tried 6-APB a couple times (I had fun but it was strange). Will a dose like this have me rolling for a few hours? I happen to have some leftover cash on SR so I think I might go for one. I&#039;d be happy to post a review of my experience as well.<br />-Astyanax

				I&#039;m serious good sir. Why does it seem like I&#039;m spamming? I&#039;m just wondering about an analogue that I&#039;ve never knowingly tried and definitely have never had in its pure form.

				in my town everyone here prefers speed based rolls (methylone is top of the line)<br />MDMA is a little different but through my experience i get really really depressed and sometimes<br />suicidal after MDMA because of the drain of serotonin and with methylone it was an easier comedown<br />for me. because of the amphetamine in it its a little rough on your muscles with all the tensing but its <br />no worse than LSD.<br />dosage though. i would suggest 2 doses of my 210mg caps about an hour apart and your in luck actually!<br />the first 5 orders get an extra 50% in their order but if its my sample ill just send 2 free rolls for $5 shipping!<br />:D<br />and invest in some glow sticks ;)
