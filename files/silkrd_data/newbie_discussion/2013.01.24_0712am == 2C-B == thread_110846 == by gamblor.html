				read what alexander shulgin has to say about it: http://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/read.php?id=20<br /><br />i&#039;ve taken it a handful of times at a wide range of doses and agree that it&#039;s very &quot;dose dependent&quot;. it was never very visual for me and I took&nbsp; up to 30mg of pure product.&nbsp; it enhanced music, caused a medium amount of introspection, and had a mild body load/high. I bought some on here and while I liked it I don&#039;t think i&#039;ll ever do it again. People combine it with MDMA a lot, on the come down I believe (I would double check this), but I never did. I&#039;ll stick to my occasional mushrooms and very occasional lsd I think. hope that helps and let me know if you have any more questions. <br />

				My friend who I gave some to said that he found it to be an aphrodisiac and while I agreed, I happened to be alone on most of the occasions and never with someone I was intimate with. Low dose for this purpose though I would say. try 10mg to start.

				I&#039;ve had 2cb quite a few times that i could prolly count them all on 2 hands, and imo i absolutely loved each one. Every trip was different from the last, ranging from extreme laughter to the point where i was crying even though no one was cracking any jokes LOL! Also intesne body highs almost like waves of pleasure were following thru my body and massaging my brain (muscle contraction). Music is awesome on it&nbsp; listened to alot of dubstep while sitting in my mates car at a one night over looking the city at a beautiful lookout, colors look very vibrant and if i closed my eyes i c alot of patterns and spirals.. I assume it similar to LSD not that i have done it before

				The visuals stand out on 2C-B.&nbsp; The snorted dose is less than the oral.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe the pain from snorting it is worth it in small nasal doses.&nbsp; Larger doses the high kicks in quickly and sweeps away the discomfort.&nbsp; Visuals on 2C-B and LSD, phenomenal!

				I have done it quite many times. Between 8 and 32 mg orally. It&#039;s an easy psychedelic. Fun, but not very profound for me. 8 mg is a perfect mood boaster for parties combined with alcohol for me.

				Always wondered what 2cb was like. Many years ago when it must have been pretty fresh I was offered some free of charge whilst stood in the q for a major dance festival but because id never tried it before I passed on the sample. Im a bit of a soft arse when it comes to taking drugs and I dont like trying new drugs. Between mdma, mushrooms, cocaine and weed I feel iv gt enough vices already and by combining the 4 in different ratios you can have a pretty wide specrum of experiences

				&quot; It is, in my opinion, one of the most graceful, erotic, sensual, introspective compounds I have ever invented. For most people, it is a short-lived and comfortable psychedelic, with neither toxic side-effects nor next-day hang-over. Its effects are felt very much in the body, as well as in the mind, and thus it has found clinical use as a follow-up to MDMA. Once the MDMA has shown you where your problems are, the 2C-B opens up the emotional, intuitive and archetypal area of your psyche to help you solve them. It was probably one of my favorite drugs, back in those yesteryear days when one could explore one&#039;s consciousness with legal immunity.&quot;<br /><br />-- Dr. Shulgin

				Shulgin is amazing! Everyone interested in things like life, psychedelic substances, psychology, self development and conciousness should read Pihkal and Tihkal! Pihkal is better, but Tihkal has some really interesting episodes as well.

				Tried 2c-b about 2 years ago, for me it was very visual, slight body load, nothing uncomfortable tho, comedown was easy, took it at 3 pm, after trip was over 6 hrs later, went out with friends and had a good time, would reccomend it for anyone interested in something no where near as profound as lsd, but still wanting visuals

				It was the first thing I ever tripped on. In fact I binged out on it for a whole weekend. Then I never touched it again. My 2-C days are definitely behind me. They were fun, but the more of &#039;em I did the worse the side effects got. I always found the 2-C body load (not as much B as with some of the others) to be off-0putting if not downright unpleasant. Once I found acid I never looked back.

				In my area, quality of a drug is a hit or a miss.. if the availability of a drug even exists...<br /><br />I do know an individual that had taken it once but based again on the above, who knows what the stuff was. He had taken it in pill form, so dosage could have been anywhere. When I asked him about the experience, he just had a stunned look on his face as if he couldn&#039;t explain it. <br /><br />Out of the numerous hallucinogens, I&#039;ve only ever tried mushrooms, two varieties. Ive had wide spectrum responses to them, 1/2 chance for me, it will be a bad one. I&#039;ve also had dirty ecstasy that caused the walls to breathe, but I was so fucked I couldn&#039;t of cared (Not in a bad way, I was just incapacitated from the overpowering high)<br /><br />I&#039;m very hesitant to dip my toe into into another hallucinogen but I have friends pushing LSD on me. I just don&#039;t think I can sign up for the duration. Now that I am involving myself in the road and learning about things like 2-CB, I&#039;m intrigued. I&#039;ll have to look into it more.. <br /><br />I must admit, on very high doses of MDMA/Clean ecstasy I&#039;ve had memorizing closed eye visuals. I wouldn&#039;t mind some of that, will 2-CB be my fix? I&#039;ve seen the MDMA + 2CB combos.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve only done it once. 20mg. I agree with what&#039;s being said here - it&#039;s fun, but not introspective. LSD is much better if you want to be shot to the center of the universe. For me, 2CB was intensely visual (watched the documentary &quot;home&quot; while tripping, I definitely recommend it as the cinematography is beautiful and it&#039;s a little trippy even if sober). Visuals were not only intense, but pleasurable. Not much body high, virtually no introspection.

				@FiddyPysch: I think 2C-B sounds like it would fit the bill.<br /><br />@R4N50M: MDMA is technically a mild psychedelic.&nbsp; That makes sense.&nbsp; I think that you&#039;d enjoy 2C-B.&nbsp; it&#039;s more visual that it&#039;s relatives(the rest of the 2C&#039;s).<br /><br />As some people have said, it&#039;s not very deep.&nbsp; I&#039;d say I&#039;m rather lucid while under it&#039;s influence.&nbsp; So, probably a proportionate amount more lucid on 2C-B than on acid as the difference is from shrooms to acid.&nbsp; Does that make sense?<br /><br />@blue123blue123: There&#039;s a couple people selling high quality MDMA in the US.&nbsp; Most of it&#039;s resold from the road.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t find them using the search term or browsing on the main site I can probably dig out some links.&nbsp; As far as the MDA goes, I don&#039;t remember the vendor&#039;s name, but I&#039;m pretty sure I saw one advertising that he was selling 3Jane&#039;s MDA.&nbsp; (3Jane&#039;s shit is always the bomb!)<br /><br />EDIT: Just noticed, it looks like costco is selling some MDA domestically.

				Well, here&#039;s my trip report from about 25mg of GrandWizard&#039;s 2C-B:<br /><br />June 1st 2013<br />I saw fractals when I closed my eyes. I had the ability to physically melt with external objects. I had absolutely no sense of time. I had no physical body because it became one with everything. The phenomenal world and my mental states were totally malleable and in my control. I said at one point &quot;I&#039;ve never felt so powerful in my life&quot;. I realized that my consciousness gives birth to the world and in a way I&#039;m totally in charge of the phenomenal experience. I walked over to a grip and did a one-arm pull up with each arm...I cannot do that sober, not even close. Today my bicep fuckin hurts, I pushed my arm beyond it&#039;s physical capacity!<br /><br />I feel like I don&#039;t need to do psychedelics for many years. I&#039;m set. It&#039;s time to work on and focus my energy into this life game. But anyways, at one point I was standing knee deep in the ocean and the biggest revelation of my entire lift smacked me in the face. It felt like one of those religious moments that converts or prophets speak of.<br /><br />There&#039;s this great essay Schopenhauer wrote about free will and our lack of it in the phenomenal world. He said that in a transcendent way we do have free will in the world of noumena (Will as thing-in-itself) but that it doesn&#039;t act on the world of phenomena...something like that. So when I was tripping it made perfect sense that the future was already written and this whole soup of twirling phenomena was fated. But what I was really curious about was noumena...whether or not it&#039;s divine. What I realized in the water is that there&#039;s no objective answer and that it was totally up to me to create that reality. Like it&#039;s not objectively true that god does or doesn&#039;t exist, I have the power to create him. I had this limited sense of transcendental free will and the only fucking possible choice in life to be made was whether or not to believe noumena is divine. Simple. A leap of faith, an affirmation, &quot;God&quot; as a choice not a fact. As soon as I made the affirmative choice I was fuckin overwhelmed with divine beauty, it was unreal, so perfect. God is a subject not an object…we are that subject, we are gods, and we have the power to create divinity as a subject realizing it&#039;s own godhood.<br /><br />I realized my ancestors are always present, always at a distance but must be recognized and accepted. I realize the way to clean up California&#039;s coastline is to find hippies and give them drugs and trash bags. We bathed in the sea and Pink Floyd&#039;s The Wall timed out to everything. Synchronisity.
