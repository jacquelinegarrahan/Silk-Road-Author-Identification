				Hello,<br />I am a newby yes, but I am not an idiot and always before I taste everything, I send it to the lab to know what compound is inside. Three weeks ago I bought 5 tabs of Hoffman &quot;LSD&quot; selled by Gammagobling, and now I have the result... there is no LSD inside this tabs, there is psylocybine or psylocine or DMT, so FAKE totally...<br />Yes, he send to me in 3 days only, very fast. and in a very good package but the most important is that this tabs ARE NOT LSD. I am waitting for the final results in the LAB with all the substance that the tab contains.<br />Please, this vendor have a thread in another forum http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9025.0<br />and I can not put messages... anybody can warns other please<br />If it is necessary I have a photo with the first test.<br /><br />0.30BTC to the trash...

				You sent 5 lsd tabs &quot;to the lab&quot; my ass. There is no such thing. Quit trying to smear a long-time member because you&#039;re inept. Just reading the title of this post makes me think you&#039;re tripping on his acid right now. Go home guy, you&#039;re drunk.

				I would really love to have psilocybin on blotters... who wouldn&#039;t!?<br /><br />Now, seriously. Looks like some vendor is really fed up with our prices and I understand it. Just check the discussion on our profile (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/discussion/user/3923da3fab). Suddenly, two newbies (less than $100 spent on SR) complain about our tabs without even contacting us personally. We had an outstanding number of transactions on these Hofmanns and an army of satisfied, returning customers. We are going to supply more and more of them, so this guy must be really scared that we&#039;ll steal his market. Well, if he can&#039;t keep up, then we will :)<br /><br />On the side note, we are closely cooperating with LSD Avengers and will let them test a new batch as soon as we get back from vacation. But I guess that our feedback speaks for itself :)<br /><br />

				LOL at &#039;psylocybine&#039; blotters. Maybe he means psylocin or psylocetin but if that&#039;s what he means then you should be charging more considering how rare those drugs are.<br /><br />I&#039;m being sarcastic btw this is blatant bullshit sending 5 tabs to &#039;the lab&#039;.

				Dear friends,<br />If I am wrong I will give my apollogies to all the community and specially to gammagobling. In 15 days aprox. I will receive the results of the lab for @chromatogrpahy test. Last week I went to do a first test with some reactives like marquis, mendelin, etc...<br />Attach to the mail there are two photos: one of the 5 tabs that I received from the vendor, and the other is after two reagent test. Two drops in the photo, the first (up) is after test a part of a tab with MARQUIS reagent, result negative to MDMA, SPEED, 2CB, etc... The scond drop (down) is after test another part of a tab with P/DMAB reagent like ELHRICH result positive to psilocibine/psilocine (yellow to green) or maybe DMT (yellow).<br /><br />first<br />http://postimg.org/image/fug0b74cv/<br /><br />first<br />http://s22.postimg.org/m8spajnwx/image.png<br /><br />Regards,<br />JC
