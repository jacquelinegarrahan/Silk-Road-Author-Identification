				Would people recommend using a &quot;above ground&quot; exchanger, or one of the established ones here on SR?<br /><br />Thanks for your input.

				I would recommend local or exchangers. You can&#039;t stay in escrow when buying BTC with SR or any other site like it, so big risk of scams.

				I did look at locals but the rates were super high by me, or too high a minimum.<br /><br />Are there any vendors of Bitcoins on SR that can be described as truly impeccable?

				There is no such adjective as impeccable unless you are describing an inanimate object. <br /><br />There is always going to be a risk buying from SR or anything like it.<br /><br />It&#039;s not illegal to buy coins. When they are deposited to SR they go through a tumbler. What are you worried about? Just use an exchange.<br />If you get caught for BTC in relation to SR and illegal purchases, then they have far far more on you than a simple, legal, BTC transaction.

				I have had good luck with bitcoin-brokers.org the fee is 2% and they hold the bitcoin in escrow until the seller confirms payment.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d second localbitcoins.com. Keep an eye on the rates, they do fluctuate. Nowadays, no such thing as a cheap bitcoin....

				I hope when I get to 50 posts I can find a thread with some good instructions for the process. I&#039;m just starting with bitcoin and know nothing. Maybe some of you have some thoughts.<br /><br />My first bitcoin wallet, before I even knew about SR, was with Blockchain. I still have it. Horrible choice, I would suspect, because that wallet was registered under my primary email address. I don&#039;t want to send any bitcoin to SR from that wallet, for sure. Or, am I being too cautious there? What I am still trying to find out is the best procedure from start to finish, i.e. should I first register an anonymous email account and then create a wallet? If I use an anonymous email is it then safe to create a wallet with Blockchain? See what I mean about being at a very basic starting point?<br /><br />If anyone has any thoughts to share, edify me please :-)

				Head over to bitcointalk.org and read through a few things, you&#039;ll learn about the most reputable routes. I always used bitinstant but they seemed to of shut down. I&#039;ve been buying greendot moneypaks personally and selling them to people for btc.
