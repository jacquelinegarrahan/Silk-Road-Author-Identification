				why don&#039;t sellers just insist on tracked mail for new users. that way they can prove to silk road that the item was delivered and so get their cash released. and they don&#039;t have to put new members at risk or go through the hassle of resolution with silk road. it would benefit everyone.<br /><br />in fact i would say to new users that if a seller tries to insist on FE then offer to pay for tracked mail instead. i would rather pay a couple of more quid than go through the risk of getting ripped off.

				if they did it that way, the hassle with the resolution center and waiting would be on them.<br />by requiring FE they get the money instantly, don&#039;t have to fear refunding etc.<br /><br />FE makes venders lives so much easier...

				but they wouldn&#039;t really have nothing to fear if they have honest intentions. they would get their money even if a scammer tried it on, as they could prove to resolution that it was delivered(well that something was delivered at least). they would likely gain extra business as new buyers would be more relaxed about buying from them.

If not they can be a very good operation.&nbsp; <br />There are plenty of guys here who wont ask FE, I say reward them with your business and the rest will have to follow

				Also you generally have to go into the post office to get tracking which vendors dislike doing.

				Tracked packages cost more for the shipper, and they still have the problem of not getting them any money for a pretty long time after it&#039;s sent.<br /><br />That and you can only really track packages when you&#039;re shipping domestically in most cases...<br /><br />Basically, it&#039;s way more hassle to the seller, for almost no reward, since if they have the buyer FE there&#039;s not much the buyer can do anyway.
