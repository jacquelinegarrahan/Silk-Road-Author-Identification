				I have my Bitcoins all lined up- I was planning on &quot;laundering&quot; the Bitcoins through a few digi-wallets before transferring funds into my SR account.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am thus far unfamiliar with the extra security protocols to protect ones anonymity- I have seen a few threads on PGP and the like, but don&#039;t quite understand it.&nbsp; Could someone please give a few pointers.<br /><br />Lastly- Can anyone offer advice through their experiences on which vender on SR offers best MDMA.<br /><br />Peace and Love to those who respond!

				PGP can be a little daunting if you&#039;ve never used it, but once you know how it works, it&#039;s actually very simple. I would recommend looking for a youtube tutorial of someone explaining the software and providing step by step instructions on how to use it. That&#039;s the easiest way to learn in my opinion. Best of luck!

				pgp seemed intimidating to me at first too. I made my first like 5ish orders without using it at all . I wouldn&#039;t recommend that though. <br />I downloaded gpg4win , it&#039;s free and I figured it out just fucking around with it for a few hours . No tutorials , no nothing. I&#039;m&nbsp; far from being any kind of computer wiz either.

				&nbsp; Don&#039;t know the best MDMA vendor these days.&nbsp; I can say every time (only like 3) that I&#039;ve gotten molly on here its been very legit in quality though pills (only gotten like three times as well) aren&#039;t much different than street.&nbsp; I don&#039;t live in the netherlands or anything though.<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve never laundered bitcoins, but I never boughten them with my anything that can be traced back to me.&nbsp; My biggest worry about using a service like that is that one day they&#039;ll go rogue and send the bitcoins to their wallet once people trust them.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; PGP is very important, it is what hides the information that connects your name and location directly with the contraband.&nbsp; Every vendor (that is worth buying from) should have a thing on the profile page that says something like&nbsp; -<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFExHvIBCADdtYGO7/g0iSv/H9QG6W5998HqrmP4r7qi35TvaUgcTsnDpBhm<br />h7GmtDprxbPQP+rg5/pKNRI1rRrBDEymBD6oC5Kln1vInpRODgE9l/HRI6Uv+<br />EV13G3DejYbMTGulc+jnuPDsBqguKHP1CmeN83MnWSfsItA1r8qEw9gT8Qx5hYBA<br />FQaYj2KPPnxAAnbnxmmrmp9vzRHRbWEKimem1Nn/lqJlXaviLwClYxM6asQUxSru<br />ovjkqMPHo9vo8pWNEDkKvAFwC7Ta8NBI5Lf/ABEBAAG0J1RoZSBEb3BlIFNwb3Qg<br />PHRoZWRvcGVzcG90QHRvcm1gkQQJxwN9luLX1AGQf/bnyJOVWknORA0twT<br />qFU2vcwAshtWDWeAp5eNMRxayIz94Ha+VedMJd25Tsu7mpWlspHccWV7ml70TY6b<br />DjtNh78unE5FzK8H3kgsf7JG4xl2CPIvrWIn+z4HmMklh1rSSwaPezGwjlihRkCV<br />oqIzNLTVGKxr3lo/iVlc4JVzxSNeg70jvdJRYsdE9lHd2ThmkzDSmYMwl+LttGMh<br />Ds35CAA+57F6R4flxH33BScAjxl2k4aaoqGs3YAQEAtvMX5RiSYZtyLK0QAOxbPD<br />Qs94LpnDosikqE7zwtnda+om7d7hRxKIkkmnGzXxPq5t1SkPv5/uiomCj5+Zjk/T<br />uL5e4<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - (not a real key) this is their public key.&nbsp; What a public key does is enables you to send them messages that only they can read since they (hopefully) are the only ones who know their private key.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you get a PGP program (I use gpg) you will add their public key to your key ring then make your message (which contains your address you want it sent to [using real name seems to have much higher success rate and be safer.])&nbsp; Your program should have an option of encrypting this message with one of the keys on your key ring.&nbsp; Encrypt it with the vendor&#039;s public key that is on your key ring and then copy and paste the encrypted message into the silkroad shopping car window where you put your address.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;ve only used GPG though the process could be totally different for a different program.&nbsp; Good luck, I hope you get some good times from the road.

				Reddit has a subreddit where you can practice sending encrypted messages to each other.&nbsp; I would give that a try, they will be willing to help you.<br /><br />Unfortunately the subreddit name eludes me at the moment, I&#039;m sure a search will find it though
