				It&#039;s Stupid Newbie Time with your Host, Miles Standoffish!<br /><br />So I&#039;ve tried multiple times now, to add a personal avatar icon. However, after cutting various images down to size, converting them to different formats, etc, I&#039;ve not been able to get mine to work. Am I missing something or just stupid (or both?!). I thought there might be guidelines on the maximum scale or filesize, but I have not seen them yet.<br /><br />(On a side note: is anyone else incredibly annoyed by the bitcoin ad noob spam or the repeated new topics just titled &quot;asafs&quot; or &quot;safff&quot; or &quot;fasdI&#039;manasswhocan&#039;tgetto50postswithoutlookinglikeIneedahockeyhelmeatdasdsa&quot; ?)

It&#039;s a hard task getting an animation uploaded, my current one is 13.1KB I tried uploading one that was 16.4KB it got rejected, does anyone know what the maximum filesize is? I like the way you wrote your post MilesStandoffish, not because your a stupid newbie, you&#039;re not it&#039;s a very sensible question to ask, your humour in your opening sentence made me smile (and it&#039;s refreshing to see a question I haven&#039;t seen before) have your first +1 from me :)

I look forward to them correcting this issue. After SR forums &quot;up-graded&quot; (lulz ::)) to, um, 2.0.3., lulz... (don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ll get used to my type of commentary) the avatars stuffed up for some reason. You can&#039;t upload avatars without resizing them or making sure they are 65x65 pixels, or 53x53 pixels for an animated avatar, at most. (Don&#039;t bother trying to find one, as this is an insanely small amount of bits.... I would look for a regular avatar.) Hang in there, hopefully they will look into this. Not sure why it happened it first place....... worked before, just not any more.<br /><br />You can, of course, simply google &#039;65x65 avatars&#039;, pick one to upload, and then you&#039;ll know I&#039;m not lying lol. This will at least get you SOMETHING up quickly, until you can choose which pic you want to resize. (Just remember not to use quotes as google gets confused now on this issue; it brings up 0 results. I think there&#039;s something in the water lately. Don&#039;t know why everyone backward these days) Get back to us if having difficulty.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.<br /><br />[Edit. Good to see Princess here. Did you ge locked out of regular forums lol?&nbsp; ::) lulz........]<br /><br />[Edit. luv your Valentine&#039;s avatar! :)]

				A 65 X 65 animated avatar works fine, tried and tested :) If anyone is having trouble uploading their avatar upload it QicPic http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/ and pm me I&#039;ll try my best to help. Happy you like my new Valentine&#039;s avatar Razorspyne it took a lot of tweaking before it was accepted but you know what they say practice makes perfect! I hope the admin find a solution for all of the bugs soon, on the plus side it&#039;s a lot less buggy than it was a few weeks ago (I hated not having my smiles and had to remember them from memory fortunately my memory served me well lol!).<br /><br />No I didn&#039;t get locked out of the regular forums I think this forum is open to everyone now, which is great, I&#039;ll be helping a lot around here now :)<br /><br />
