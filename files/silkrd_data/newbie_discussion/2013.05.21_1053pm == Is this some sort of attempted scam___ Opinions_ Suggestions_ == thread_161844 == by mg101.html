				I&#039;m not going to name the seller this early on, or report them or anything as I&#039;d rather give them a chance to sort things out, but can anyone make any sense of this???<br /><br />Conversation in chronological order, irrelevant bits shortened, apoligies for the length!<br /><br /><br /><br />Transaction #123123123123<br />status: resolution center<br />buyer: XXXXXXXXXX<br />seller: ZZZZZZZZZZ<br />item: YYYYYYYYYYYYY<br />shipping: Priority Tracking Worldwide<br />ordered: May 3, 2013, 10:17 am UTC<br />shipped: May 5, 2013, 7:58 pm UTC<br /><br /><br />Vendor to Buyer (16 Days)<br />Due to the volatility of SR going up and down, up and down, I am asking everyone to please FE for the time being. For your order you will receive XXXXX bonus for FE.....................<br /><br />(16 Days)<br />Hi, thanks for your message. I understand your concern re the volatility of SR! I&#039;m happy to either.....<br />Keep the order current and in escrow, or<br />Ask you to cancel it and I&#039;ll FE on a smaller order with you <br /><br /><br /><br />Vendor to Buyer (16 Days)<br />OK, no problem, no offense taken at all mate. Thanks for letting me know that! I do appreciate your message. Please understand that you do not HAVE to FE. I am not requiring you to do so, at all. You will receive your order regardless. I was just trying to avoid any delay in the receiving of the payment due to the site being sometimes hard to get on. For that I was going to give you an extra 20% more for you doing so.<br />Your particular order will stay in escrow for the duration. You will receive your order regardless. I understand that I am a new vendor on SR but I would not open an expensive account, only to cut myself short by my reputation and by my money, a few weeks later. I plan on staying for the duration. As long as the site lasts for that matter. <br /><br /><br />Buyer&nbsp; to Vendor&nbsp; (16 days)<br />Thanks mate, I look forward to seeing the postman, and all being well you can expect another order soon after. Welcome to SR, and good luck - I look forward to doing business with you!<br /><br /><br />Buyer&nbsp; to Vendor (1 day)<br />Hi, just letting you know this one has not arrived yet<br /><br /><br /><br />Vendor to Buyer (1 Days)<br />Your order was sent on Saturday. Should be getting very early part of next week. And again these delays wont happen in the future. If it weren&#039;t for customs, I wouldn&#039;t have lost so much damn time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day<br /><br /><br />Vendor to Buyer (1 Days)<br />Could you please send me your address using Privnote? I am having trouble importing public keys through the command prompt at the moment. I appreciate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />Vendor to Buyer (5 hours)<br />I am cancelling your order. I needed the address. I am sorry I couldn&#039;t make your order as fast as I would liked to. :( I like my orders fast and reliable just as everyone else. This may sound stupid, but I do have a new shipment in at the moment. If you order again, I will make sure that you get it in time. i.e. The very next day. But I would need your address. You can send it to me via Privnote. I cannot import PGP keys at the moment. Sorry. <br /><br /><br />Vendor to Buyer (5 hours)<br />Your order finally went out on Monday via First class mail. You should be getting it today or tomorrow. Your order went out yesterday. Please have a small amount of patience with me. Things are finally where they should be.<br /><br /><br />Vendor to Buyer (5 hours)<br />PLEASE SEND ME YOUR ADDRESS.......... <br /><br /><br />Buyer&nbsp; to Vendor (1 minute)<br />My order was to XXXXXXX I must ask, if the order was sent out already, why do you need the address again? <br />Sorry mate, I don&#039;t mean to be difficult, but you gotta understand my position too <br />
