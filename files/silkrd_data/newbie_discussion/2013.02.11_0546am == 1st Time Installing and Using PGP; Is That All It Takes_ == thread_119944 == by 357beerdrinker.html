				I read through the PGP threads and tutorial and installed the PGP software on my usb drive and went through the process of generating a key.&nbsp; I then created a test message, encrypted it using my own key and sent myself a test email to my tormail account.&nbsp; I was successfully able to copy/paste that email back into the PGP software and was able to decrypt the message and read the plain text.<br /><br />It seems that I just need to make sure I copy someone&#039;s full public key when importing it the first time and the software will take care of the decryption.&nbsp; Then just use the PGP software to encrypt, then copy/paste that text into whatever message I&#039;m sending out.&nbsp; (Assuming the recipient has already imported my own public key)<br /><br />Am I missing anything obvious?<br /><br />P.S. Yes, I already have truecrypt on my machine.

				That&#039;s it.&nbsp; It is actually pretty simple and once you have a little practice encrypting and decrypting messages it works very smoothly.&nbsp; I hope when you made your public key you used your silk road name.&nbsp; If not, when you get a vendor like me who has tons of keys and I go to send you a message after importing your key, I won&#039;t know which one is yours.&nbsp; Some people miss this very important point.&nbsp; If I had only a couple of keys it wouldn&#039;t matter much, but remember I am importing a public key for everyone that I reply to with encryption.&nbsp;

				Thanks for confirming.&nbsp; Yes, I did make sure to use my SR name when creating the key since I had read that it would cause confusion and additional work on anyone I send it to.&nbsp; Now I just gotta procure some BTC and I&#039;m ready to do some shopping.&nbsp; Oh, and it&#039;s tax season too.&nbsp; I believe big brother owes me some money so I&#039;ll take those unused taxes and purchase some party supplies.

				3 hours per session, 5 beers an event, 7 nites of the weeks&#039; got it, but for those other first time pgp users,<br /><br />one will be messaging someone else who already has their public key posted on some listing or vendor page, (or even in the clearweb world), can advertise their public key.<br /><br />you copy into your key manager their public key.<br /><br />on any message you send anyone you are new to doing business with , you encrypt whatever info is necessary to communicate &quot;TO&quot; them, it spits out a buncha garble.&nbsp; <br /><br />you copy /paste into the address field on &quot;add to cart&quot;/ or &quot;message user/vendor&quot; the encrypted garble from the previous step (of whatever the tor bundle software provides). <br /><br />to make things easier for everyone, attach your public key to the top or bottom of the message (you just encrypted) so the recipient of all that garble can more efficiently decode it as to not check the forum for your specific username public key.<br /><br />typically when sending a message, i use the above steps.&nbsp; i will have a-<br /><br />---a buncha pgp garble---(ecrypted to whoever)<br /><br />&nbsp;and<br /><br />---my public pgp key---<br /><br />so as they can respond efficiently.

				@ Princess, thank you for the offer.&nbsp; I will PM you tomorrow as I&#039;ve already disconnected my USB.&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll move all the files from this one onto my IronKey tomorrow and secure-wipe this one.&nbsp; I could truecrypt the USB but from what I&#039;ve read, the Ironkey&#039;s haven&#039;t been hacked yet and I just didn&#039;t have it on me today.<br /><br />Thanks everyone for the responses and support.&nbsp; Security is everyone&#039;s part to play.
