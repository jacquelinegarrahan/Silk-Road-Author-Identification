YOUr nothing post that no one read but myself where you tell a lie about me and dealing with me CLEARLY had no impact.<br /><br />Can you not see how I go around and call out liars and scammers???<br /><br />Be a man and not someone that is hiding behind a screen name. If you hav a problem with me...address me. Pretty simple...don&#039;e waste your time about me in the forums..all you do is spread lies and mor ebs...<br /><br />Do you really think I care if they are talking about me in the&nbsp; forums???? There is at most 200 people in here usually 100..half are vendors...the other half are no bodys and scammers...I usually leave the no bodys alone..USUALLY as I do not know them..<br /><br />I get plenty of attention on SR...where all I care about is coming through!<br /><br />So once again...if you have a legit beef...send me a pm..LIKE A BOSS..not a lying asshole.<br /><br />End message from (((((((((( RxKing ))))))))))<br /><br /><br /><br />He is mad because he is being called out as potential scammer.

				Be as it be, you have done a complete idiocy and bad thing. Posting PRIVATE messages in a PUBLIC forum is totally unpolite towards the person you are communicating with. If there is some meaning to post the message (as in the case of a blackmail attempt or a scam etc. so that you inform others, for example) then I can understand, but in this case it is completely out of place and it is actually speaking worse for you than Rx (no matter what he says there).<br /><br />The conversations that goes on between you two are for you two alone. It is completely coward and not respectful to post private conversations for all to see. You aren&#039;t in kindergarten anymore, boy. When you talk with a person in PRIVATE you expect that person to not go around posting what you say him/her in public, no matter the topic and not matter the idiocies (in case) that can come up; this goes beyond the fact of who of the two is right or wrong or if Rx is really a poser or not. Do you understand that in doing so you are passing yourself as a kid and a not respectful person that nobody with a little of dignity would want to have anything to do with?<br /><br />Do you every time you have a problem with a person spread the conversation you have had with that person privately around without his/her previous consent? Do you understand how low of a behavior this is?

				I completely understand your position here IRIS... However to me this matter isn&#039;t PRIVATE... In his message he stated many things that I have been saying to others about the way he treats users here... this only backs up what I am saying... If he had released any kind of personal info, which I doubt he would since he likes to hide behind his keyboard and screen, I would not have posted it... I&#039;m not here to cause that kind of harm but to say I&#039;m not in kindergarten anymore, boy? Sounds like the king has a user name here trying to make it seem like I am in violation of a standard that he doesn&#039;t like. Maybe the king would like to settle this in private. NO KEYBOARD NO SCREEN&gt;&gt;&gt; FACE TO FACE... but then again that would be wishful thinking, so for now I&#039;ll just stick to making sure everyone knows what the king is all about...<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there will be a plethora of users here to defend rx and make it seem i am in the wrong... that is typically how these threads go.... <br /><br />&nbsp;edit for a typo....

				This OP is CLEARLY a loser. <br /><br />I would normally not even address a troll/loser....as this is just another shill account from another Moron I have called out being a liar. So he believes he can make a thread...put my great name in it...and then say stupid shit and people will read it and believe it.<br /><br />Well he has done just that. And all he has shown is how he has no clue about anything. And that no one cares what he has to say...<br /><br />First and foremost...of course he should not be posting PM&#039;s. BUT if he is ...could he at least put it in good&nbsp; form and make it so anyone that reads it can understand what I actually said to him. His OP is so bad...people can not even understand it...and he thinks he fixed that. Again..we are dealing with an idiot...so keep that in mind.<br /><br />The FACTS are this is someone with zero credibility and is saying nothing that is remotely truthful. I have the best feedback on SR for a vendor...SURE there are a lot of other vendors that have PERFECT 100 scores with over 300 sales that&nbsp; have just as good&nbsp; of feedback. Just none better then me..Also&nbsp; I have been a vendor for over 1 year and have never had anything but 5/5&#039;s on over 4k orders. So when this troll with 50 post and&nbsp; CLEARLY from&nbsp; a shill account of someone I have exposed as a liar and a thief says &quot; I am mad that he is being called out as potential scammer&quot;.... that&nbsp; is laughable. I have NEVER been called out as a scammer. I have only called out others that were in fact scamming. That&#039;s what I do!!! This loser uses multiple accounts to try and hide the fact he has been called out and is a liar and a thief.<br /><br />So again I should not even give this loser the time of day...but I have to address this idiot so I am on record once again telling the facts. But in truth... he says nothing..in his last post he says that maybe I would like to settle this in private with no keyboard and no screen...face to face! LMAO...now if that line does not show ALL OF YOU...what a total whack job/IDIOT loser this guy is...then I do not know what to say. He also says that I am mean...lol..YES I am if you are a scammer and a liar or you just say REALLY STUPID SHIT. Like he is with this new name of his.<br /><br />If you read his last post you will see how he thinks I know about what he has been saying to others about how I treat users around here...First I have no fucking clue who he is even talking about or who he has spoken too....and I could care less..I mean he is a nobody.???How does someone with 50 post say anything to anyone ...and they would listen to him? I do not think so! <br /><br />Second he is upset because I called out his terrible advice he gave in a newbie thread to a potential vendor..that would lead to scamming. And I will always call out scammers and liars in here. And in doing&nbsp; so I am going to get some people upset and they are going to create multiple accounts here in the forums and say stupid shit.(like this idiot is doing) I can not stop that. But anyone with a quarter of a brain could see that when someone has NOTHING...I mean can not back up one of their stupid claims with evidence..and they are a brand new account.. and they say stupid shit....that they are CLEARLY a liar. Like this guy.<br /><br />I do love how he says &quot; I like to HIDE behind my keyboard and screen&quot;....He dummy we all hide behind our computer and screen!!! WTF...you say more dumb shit with every line I read.<br /><br />And&nbsp; charligibson...you are not doing a very good job of letting everyone know what I am all about...First they all know...I have been here long enough to be a proven awesome vendor. And they all know I write long post and I call out losers and crooks and liars and thief&#039;s...and when I do...I AM ALWAYS CORRECT. They also Know I respect SR and that all I care about is MY customer getting there drugs...and that ANY SR user does not get scammed. PERIOD. So if that is what want the users to know...then great.<br /><br />And NO ONE needs to defend me...they all KNOW you are wrong..that is not even up for debate...and clearly...you have NOTHING<br />&nbsp;factual to say. Though if you are going to say stuff in here...you should use just one forum account..and stand behind what you say...don&#039;t be a bitch...and don&#039;t forget this is a forum for illegal drugs...and that privacy is NUMBER ONE.<br /><br />Just quit lying and using multiple accounts.<br /><br />And if anyone wants a god laugh and REALLY wants to see what this idiot is about...search his post and see what this guy is really saying.<br /><br />Take care<br />RxKing

				I am calling you out as a SCAMMER....... Calling you out..... Calling you out...... Scammer Alert...... You wank ass peice of pancreas. Look out beyond your nose and see the world. You may feel better than us, but in reality you are no better than me.... I know you will beg differ but I mean come on, really? You think in the real world you make it for one second? No way Jose. I&#039;ve dealt with your type for years. Best thing you can do is lock your mommy&#039;s basement door behind you and hope you don&#039;t get a spanking. HA&nbsp; <br /><br />We know the little details that go on behind the scenes to make you look like you are the man. We know you want us to think you feel that way. Someone in your position should be above even taking money from people like us. Without you we wouldn&#039;t know what to do, would we. To say you call out scammers may be true. You as in this username RxKing.... However we know the truths behind it. <br /><br />Not really much more that can be said here other than to keep spreading the word.... Like you said, I&#039;m behind my keyboard and you are behind yours. Never a chance in meeting to settle it up square, so I&#039;ll be sure to keep the post alive as need be... I&#039;ll check back often....<br /><br />I got your PM. Anything you want to edit before I post it here?<br /><br />Long Live Rusty

				JESUS... read your last post.<br /><br />Jealous much? <br /><br />You say NOTHING! Just a bunch of nonsense...how in the world can you call out a vendor with perfect feedback for over a year...Think about what I just said and re-read it...I have been a vendor for over 1 year..going on 14 months to be exact...and I have thousands of transactions....and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE BUYERS left me 5/5!!! Read that again! ALL 5/5! For over a year.... Not only that but read what they have to say...It&#039;s beautiful! I have made a lot of people....very happy. So if you are going to lie about me...even if it is in a thread NO ONE will ever read...I expect you to offer some proof as your word is complete shit.<br /><br />That is a fact.<br /><br />Yet you...with about 50 post... and an account that is 11 days old...and NOTHING ELSE...say you are calling me out? When you call someone out you should have proof...something to back up your claim....now I&nbsp; have already told you that there is no proof and there can not be nay but of course you are too stupid to realize the facts and you do not care about the truth. You would probably start a thread that said &quot;Michael Jordan is not the best basketball player ever.&quot; or &quot;Tori Spelling is the most beautiful actress ever.&quot; <br /><br />I am LAUGHING at YOU. I only respond to you because I call out liars. IT is what I do in these forums. I try and make sure NONE of the SR users get scammed if I can help it. If I see bullshit, I call it out. Of course I can&#039;t catch every one of them..but I do my best to make sure the members do not fall for scams.FACTS to back it up. I quote them and I make sure I know what I am talking about. And nothing I do is personal. If they are a liar or a scammer I call them out. And I believe that there should be no second chances. If you are a vendor and you scam someone.BYE BYE.&nbsp; And I didn&#039;t even know you existed...but you of course LOVE THE KING...so I saw this gem you posted...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155875.msg1140876#msg1140876">Quote from: charliegibson on May 18, 2013, 01:13 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I havent read the whole thread myself either.... I just know what my personal experience with RXKING is..... very demeaning in nature like he is somehow better then us all.... at least he has us talking about him...I say the best thing to do is just leave him and all his personalities alone to argue amongst themselves.... If no one is talking about him he hurts..... just drop the RXKING threads altogether....<br /><br />just 2btc<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have to admit I love this post by you. And this post is what made me know you existed. I read this and I sent you a PM calling you a liar because you said you have had a personal experience with me. I said I have never had a personal experience with you. EVER. But I love that you problem with me is that I am demeaning in nature like I am somehow better then all of you. And I love how you try to include everyone by saying &quot;all of us&quot; LOL..What a joke you are. I am better then you and I do think of you as shit on the bottom of my sole. And I have not stepped in shit in over 10 years.You have a HISTORY of not knowing SHIT...but you still post! And the great thing about this post...is you say in the last line...&quot;just drop the RXKING threads altogether&quot;...LOL then of course you start a thread about RxKing!!And of course you have nothing on the king but you do not like I talk shit, that I am mean to scammers and stupid fucks like yourself and that I named myself RxKing and that I live up to it :). BUT the beauty of your thread is you say be careful that I AM a poser in the title...yet all you have done is be a POSER!!!! YOU ARE&nbsp; A FUCKING JOKE! You make a post saying to quit making threads about RxKing and that I love the attention and then you make a thread!!! I LOVE IT! You made this thread with the title be careful of me because I am a poser....What a loser to make a title like that. <br />Here is another post to show not only how stupid you are..but also how dangerous it is to have an idiot post and here is proof why it is dangerous and how YOU lead people to get scammed!!! Here we go!!!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=164752.msg1167706#msg1167706">Quote from: charliegibson on May 27, 2013, 06:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Their is a vendor here who offers us the ability to shop anywhere we want using our bitcoins. It is listed in the services category. I have not personally used it but I know one person who did use it and said they would use them again.<br /><br />As far as clearnet shopping it is limited to date, but it will grow overtime.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So in this one...you claim a friend uses this site and you have never used it&nbsp; but you are telling members to go to it!!!!What fucking friends do you have? NONE. I mean what kind of person does this but someone that has something to gain from false information. And again not only do you claim YOU have NEVER used it! You claim it is limited now but will grow! Now the best part of this is it shows how you are just plain stupid and how you badly want to be someone. Now you created this account &quot;charliegibson&quot; 11 days ago! Yet you claim a lot of information you have and you seem to have been here for a long time....And that others message you and give you&nbsp; information? Give me a break! No one messages YOU! It is CRYSTAL CLEAR this is an account(charliegibson) you have just made and that you have been on the SR forums for a while. Under what name I do not know...and I do not care...BUT when someone creates a new name..and they are not a new member...it can never be good...so you are for sure...A BULLSHIT ARTIST! And people are doing the right thing by not listening to you. You know...just like in real life.<br /><br />Here is another example......... And this is the question that was asked-------<br /><br />Hi In became a Vendor at the silk road just a few days ago.&nbsp; I have some really good deals on crystaline DMT right now.&nbsp; Can anyone give me some advice on how I can get the word out?&nbsp; I&#039;m getting the impression that I must have a whole crap load of posts before I can post this where it NEEDS to categorically be.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any tips on advertising would be helpful.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; <br /><br />And this is your response...and notice that you start off saying this is what YOU would do!! So you would be a scammer and a liar if you had a vendor account!!!! This is how YOU would get feedback ....I really hope you are not a vendor..Jesus Christ that would be bad!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160798.msg1138472#msg1138472">Quote from: charliegibson on May 17, 2013, 08:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">here&#039;s what i would do. skim the forums to find the people who leave reviews all over the place. these people will test your product, stealth, customer service etc..... they will leave you the proper feedback based on their experience... if they have nothing but good things to say than you better have stock cause they will be coming.....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now this one is VERY DANGEROUS and could get a lot of members scammed! You are the LAST person that should be giving advice and this is a PERFECT example!!&nbsp; So you are telling a new vendor that they should find someone in the forums and send them free drugs and have them write a review??? And they should test the customer service? How the fuck would a person that is sent free drugs for a review be leaving proper feedback for a vendor on customer service(or ANYTHING else!!!)? How in the world would the customer service be real if they are being sent free drugs for a review???? I mean your DUMB ASS actually says to find people in these forums that leave reviews and they will &quot;test&quot; the product and leave feedback and IF the feedback is good that they should be stocked up because they will be coming??? HOW FUCKING BAD IS THIS ADVICE? AND HOW BAD WOULD IT BE FOR THE COMMUNITY IF A VENDOR DID THIS AND GAVE FREE DRUGS TO SAY 20 PEOPLE AND THEY LEFT POSITIVE FEEDBACK? My god this could be the start of a HUGE SCAM! <br /><br />New vendors that send out free samples for reviews should be BANNED! That is total bullshit and that is FAKE FEEDBACK!!! The only VALID feedback comes from paying members who actually just buy the drugs and then leave Feedback! PERIOD. And all forum reviews should be unsolicited PERIOD(meaning they should be from members that actually bought the items) ! And the FACT you wrote this...this alone...just shows how dumb you are, how clueless you are, and how you could hurt the community with your total bullshit. And that members should NOT be giving advice on shit they know nothing about. Yet you have made post in many categories you know nothing about. It is what you do. Just like this thread you have made about the KING! Just a jealous post with no facts behind it.<br /><br />I could go on and on and show the people that you tout other services on SR and you try and stir members to those services. Most are about btc. You say things like &quot; we received messages from 6 people today that were scammed by so and so&quot; I mean who the fuck is &quot;WE?&quot; And who are the 6 people that send a person that has been a forum member for 11 days information? FUCKING LIAR.<br /><br />And now in your last message you post you are calling me out? You say that because I said in my last post ...in this thread ..that no one has ever called me out before for being a scammer....and so you thought you would? Well I will keep to my statement...NO ONE has ever called me out before. As you are NO ONE! NOTHING. lower then dirt. Your an assholeface.<br /><br />And then you said you are yet again going to post a PM from me? Someone already told you that you can not post PM&#039;s. Hence the title PRIVATE MESSAGE! Now it is clear you do not care about this community..and you are just another liar that has no life. And though I do not agree that you should post a PM and that it is totally wrong..if you do so... can you at least make sure it is readable? I want people to be able to read what I say to losers in PM&#039;s! I want people to not be confused.<br /><br /><br />Since I have now exposed you to be nothing but shit...hence the name SHITBALL...and I quoted you and shown anyone that reads this bullshit thread how stupid you are...and though I know NO ONE reads this thread of yours...at least the no ones will see the truth about you...that you are just another jealous...I mean really jealous... idiot...that just created this name 11 days ago... that has nothing to bring to this forum and you do not like that i am so cocky and arrogant...lol...and that I am mean.&nbsp; I love that. I love that you created a thread about me. And that you once wrote a post that said people should not do EXACTLY what you are doing! <br /><br />And I do love that you are calling me out...I mean you have nothing at all and no reason too. It is not my fault you are an old no body with a small dick, no life, nothing at all. And in my post I call you out as being a loser and I PROVE IT! I have exposed you as someone that is totally shady. As anyone that is not new but creates a new account and then starts saying all the dumb shit you do...should be stayed away from. And truth is..until I talked about you...you were nothing. And the fact is..I will no longer post in this thread...and I GUARANTEE that this thread will be long gone in a matter of days...and I will come back and find it in 2 weeks and it will be a NOTHING THREAD...and by then you will have moved on to yet another name! Time will tell...and time and time again...I am right!<br /><br />And you are right...I have a plethora of people that would come to my defense if I needed it...But I do not..as your post is clearly a joke. No one even cares. I only post in it to put you in your place and make sure that I have commented in it and told the truth about you. You are right that I go after liars. Like YOU. You said this in one of your post &quot;see how he responds to people who speak out against him..... like we are scammers.....&quot; And this is the only thing you are 100% correct in. You are scammers! You are lying. You cant back up one thing you are saying. In fact you are just saying it to say it. You are not warning anyone because no one needs to be warned. And if they did need to be warned...you are doing a good job of shoeing them what I will do to the ones that create multiple accounts and lie. I will expose them. Like i am you.&nbsp; <br /><br />So make another post loser...this time try and something that is worth reading...your a total bore and a nobody. And I will show the community by not posting in this thread again and just watching it go no where...Just like your life. Down the SHITTER.<br /><br />SHITBALL
