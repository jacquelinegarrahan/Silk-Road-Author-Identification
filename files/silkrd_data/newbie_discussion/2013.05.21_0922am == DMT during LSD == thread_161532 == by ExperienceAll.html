				Yea it takes balls, cause its the single most intense drug experience ive ever had, that I enjoyed anyway. It is, as I always say..The FINAL frontier of psychedelics.

				I&#039;ve smoked DMT during a LSD trip, and it was much more intense than just plain DMT. The afterglow was also much longer.&nbsp; DMT also combines also very nicely with mushrooms.<br /><br />Supposedly, the ultimate combination is to take DMT after having taken a MAOI orally such as syrian rue, but you should be careful with this. There is a diet you should follow before eating the MAOI, and the effects can be overwhelming for the inexperienced. I haven&#039;t tried this combination yet, but from what I hear it is very, very strong.

				Ive noticed that when DMT is smoked, while on other drugs, even if your not that high before the DMT, it seems to bring out w.e it is you where on.<br /><br />I noticed this after smoking DMT on: LSD, 2cb and even H! <br /><br />A friend and I where doing some H one night, and it had seemed to taper off, so some hours after the buzz from the dope was gone, we hit some DMT, and as soon as the initial rocket ride was done, my buddy was nodding all over again, i have a higher opiate tolerance, so i didnt get all silly, but i certainly felt the H again.

It is not the same as using DMT after LSD.<br /><br />Smoking DMT after taking harmala alkaloids slows down dramatically the experience (and naturally also making it longer just for this) also making it stronger (you need much less to obtain the same results, 20mg is like smoking 50 for example) but it has not a different flavor as LSD + DMT.<br /><br />DMT + harmala is used principally if you have difficulty &quot;bringing on earth&quot; (so to speak) the experience(s) you have with DMT usually. Personally I&#039;ve used the combination many times but now I use it no more since I&#039;ve not problem doing what I have to do with using DMT alone, but especially at beginning it was somewhat useful, yes, to interact better with the experiences I had (with DMT you have somewhat to learn how to step up at the same speed of it while you are there and it takes a little of time - and plateau, some of them very fearful if you are not accustomed to certain planes as the ones of hell/underworld - to do so fully).

				Tried once on the come down of a trip, visuals were amazing.<br />Only did a sub-breakthrough dose.<br /><br />My friend did ~50mg during the peak of a trip.<br />Was completely in awe for a good two hours after the trip.

				have done it and it was rather intense. <br /><br />was peaking very hard in a friends large backyard, he had a hammock under some trees that I laid i was positioned it.. Sitting up I used a lightbulb with a large amount of dmt in it and took one massive rip.. i set the bulb down, laid in the hammock and exhaled as I felt the my body being pressed into the hammock and my mind hurdled into space. <br /><br />it all stayed very much in the realm of the acid I had already taken ( quite a bit ) but it just made everything 10000x more intense, adding multiple layers of OEV and CEV fractals and i began to hallucinate some OEV&#039;s that were entitities at one point. <br /><br /><br />laid there for about 15 minutes as I finally came down enough to be back into peaking LSD lol. was a great time, took alot out of me but I enjoyed it.. <br /><br />not really anything profound to be had, but perhaps that was just my mindset at the time. <br /><br />

				I can&#039;t seem to build up the courage to try it. I did however experience a sub breakthrough dose after eating some mushies. That was plenty for me. But then again I&#039;m very susceptible to deem as I have a very low tolerance. I salute any who have done this. Its on my bucket list!&nbsp;
