				Hot &amp; Spicy Spam Coca, with Roasted Piquillo-Pineapple Escabèche<br /><br />Recipe courtesy of Chef Michael Fiorello of Chicago&#039;s Mercat a la Planxa<br /><br />Makes 4<br /><br />• 4 cocas, par baked (recipe to follow)<br />• 4 oz. Piquillo Pepper-Pineapple escabeche (recipe to follow)<br />• 4 oz. Manchego béchamel (recipe to follow)<br />• 1/2 cup grated Manchego cheese<br />• 12 Hot &amp; Spicy Spam slices, 1/8&quot;<br />• 1/4 cup fresh basil, julienne<br /><br />For the Coca Dough:<br />• 1 lb. Store-bought raw pizza dough<br /><br />Turn dough onto a clean work surface dusted with flour and form 2 oz. balls. Place dough balls on a tray and let them rest and proof for 30 minutes. In the meantime, preheat oven to 300F. After dough has rested, roll into long oval shapes, 1/8&quot; thick. Prick dough with a fork, and brush with a little olive oil. Place ovals on a baking sheet and cook in the oven for 3 minutes, to set shapes. Remove and allow to cool at room temperature.<br /><br />For the Manchego Cream:<br />• 1 cup Heavy Cream<br />• 1/2 cup Manchego cheese (3 month aged)<br />• 1/2 Tbsp. Salt<br /><br />In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring cream to a simmer. Whisk in the Manchego and salt until cheese is melted. Place in a heat proof container and chill.<br /><br />For the Piquillo-Pineapple Escabèche:<br />• 8 Roasted Piquillo peppers, small dice<br />• 1 cup Diced Grilled Pineapple<br />• 1/4 cup Sun-Dried Tomatoes, small dice<br />• 1/4 cup Honey<br />• 1/4 cup White Wine Vinegar<br />• 1/4 Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br />• 3 Tbsp. Red Onion, Minced<br />• 2 Tbsp. Parsley, chopped<br />• 1 Tbsp. (optional) Fresh thyme, picked and chopped<br />• 1/2 Tbsp. Salt<br />• 1/2 tsp. Freshly ground black pepper<br /><br />Mix all ingredients and allow to marinate, chilled, for at least 1/2 hour before serving.<br /><br />To Assemble Cocas:<br />Preheat oven to 450F with a pizza stone on center rack. If you don&#039;t have a pizza stone, wrap a cookie or baking sheet in aluminum foil and place, inverted, on center rack. Place 4 of the par-baked cocas on a clean, flat work surface. Spread 1 tbsp of Manchego béchamel on each. Top each coca with 3 slices of Hot &amp; Spicy Spam. Spread the grated Manchego evenly on each coca. Using a spatula, carefully place cocas on baking surface and cook until cheese is melted and golden. Remove from oven and cut each coca into four slices. Place a teaspoon of escabèche on each slice, and sprinkle with julienne basil. Serve immediately.

				Spam Fried Rice (This will go good with the Spam Musubi posted earlier ;)<br /><br />Recipe courtesy of Chef Scott Gottlich of Dallas&#039; Bijoux<br /><br />• 3 cups cooked and chilled jasmine rice<br />• 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh basil<br />• 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro<br />• 1 Tbsp. chopped scallions<br />• 1 whole egg<br />• 1/3 lbs. Spam, cubed<br />• 1 Tbsp. neutral oil (such as canola or sunflower oil)<br />• 1/2 tsp. sesame seed oil<br />• 5 drops fish sauce<br />• 2 Tbsp. soy sauce<br /><br />In a hot pan, place neutral oil and sesame oil. Once hot, add rice and sauté (a wok can be used if you have one). Add in the meat, heat and sear. When completed, push to the side of the pan and add the egg. Break it up and scramble in the pan. You want it to be scrambled in the pan so there is a contrast of yellow and white. Fold all the ingredients together. Add the herbs and fold, now add the fish sauce and soy sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br />
