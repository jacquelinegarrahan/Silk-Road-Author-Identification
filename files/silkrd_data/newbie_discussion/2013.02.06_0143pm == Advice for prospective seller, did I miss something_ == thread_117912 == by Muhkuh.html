				Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;ll have about 500g-600g of AK48 in a month and I&#039;m looking for a safe method to distribute it.&nbsp; After researching and previously buying on SR, I&#039;m convinced SR can provide the safest method for me to distribute my product, although doing probably a much smaller &quot;operation&quot; than the experienced sellers. I&#039;m located in germany and only plan to ship domestic.<br /><br />Can somebody confirm the steps I need to take in order to be a successful seller:<br /><br />- Buy vacuum sealer and enough materials to double vacuum each package<br />- Buy air cushioned envelope with appropriate postage stamps<br />- Buy postage scale<br />- Register seller account and pay the $500 signup fee which later can be refunded <br />- Offer competitive price for the quality of my product<br />- Ship fast and reliable<br />- ???<br />- Profit?<br /><br />Some additional questions:<br /><br />- Sellers are advertising their cannabis with &quot;Superb Quality&quot;, &quot;High Quality Pure Power&quot;, &quot;Medical Grade AAA&quot;.. Is this just salesman talk or are there real differences? <br />- For this amount of weed, what are the preferred divisions?<br />- What services can/should I offer that aren&#039;t existent currently in general or high volume sellers?<br />

				You may think about metal-layer-sealing for some interesting thread about leaking odor - see the shipment section of the forum.<br />I don&#039;t think the seller-upgrade fee is refundable, afaik this was only an idea here on the forum.<br /><br />Personally I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really worth the effort tbh. You have to invest some money here and need to give freebies and/or cheap competitive prices on a good product to build up some reputation here so people trust you and buy from you. This takes time, money and heart-blood - just to sell 500g weed...<br /><br />The &quot;medial grade&quot;, &quot;AAA&quot; should be real quality descriptions since it&#039;s always better to if a customer underestimates your product than if he expected better weed and gives you a bad rating. Of course a bit of salesman talk is always existent on a market :D
