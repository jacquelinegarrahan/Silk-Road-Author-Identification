				Hey Guys, <br /><br />I heard on this other site that the Silk Road is getting shut down in July because a vendor named EnterTheMatrix screwed a bunch of people over and got caught by the Australian police? Is this true or is just a rumor? I read this last week and a few weeks ago when I joined there was a couple threads of people talking about ETM and getting screwed by him, so I know that much is true.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lurked a bit on the rest of the forums today and haven&#039;t seen anything mentioning it. Personally I&#039;m yet to even make a purchase because I&#039;m broke and window shopping, hoping to come back here to the candy store when I get the cash and find bitcoins. Which is a long way of saying I&#039;m new here and don&#039;t know how much credence to give to rumors outside the site, but I hope it doesn&#039;t get shut down.&nbsp; :&#039;( This place is awesome so far.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D&nbsp;

				I actually went to find article that mentioned it and it&#039;s gone. Like, I swear I saw it though. I guess whoever wrote it learned they were spreading BS rumors and took it down. It was from Wired I think.
