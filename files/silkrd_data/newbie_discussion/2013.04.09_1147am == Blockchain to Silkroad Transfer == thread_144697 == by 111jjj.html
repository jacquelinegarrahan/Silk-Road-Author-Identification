				Hi All,<br /><br />Yesterday I sent a small amount of bitcoins from my Blockchain to my SR. It&#039;s almost been 24 hours. What do I do? Is there anyway to cancel the transaction? I contacted blockchain support and did receive a response. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know.<br /><br />-Thanks

				Bitcoin transactions are non-reversible. A Google search will have revealed that very quickly.<br /><br />When you say a small amount, how small do you mean? Silk road only displays up to 4 decimal places in your wallet. ie, if you sent less than 0.001 coins to SR they are inaccessible. This could be the reason for no show.<br /><br />Alternatively use block explorer and search for your receiving address to see if has been seen on the network.

				I was having trouble with blockchain the other day too.&nbsp; When I went to send money, it looked like an error message popped up across the screen.&nbsp; But when I checked the status,&nbsp; it made it look like it was sent to my other account right away, but the money was not in the other account.&nbsp; I had it happen to me twice on 2 different blockchain wallets.&nbsp; and i had changed the address on sr in between so i was really getting nervous.&nbsp; Well I had to go to work and figured when i got home i would contact support about it, but before I did i checked my sr account, and low and behold it was all there.&nbsp; So all ended well, but no without a scare.

				I sent 0.2 bitcoins. Visionenergy changing your address on SR will automaticaaly redirect the bitcoins from blockchain to the new address?
