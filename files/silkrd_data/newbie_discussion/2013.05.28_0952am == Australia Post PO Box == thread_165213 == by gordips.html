				Hi just wondering if anyone has any info regarding PO boxes? I live with my parents still and am scared that they will go through my stuff and i also dont really want cops poking around my house/address. Would anyone know how well obtaining a false drivers license would go in terms of getting an Australia Post PO box? Any information/solutions would be extremely useful. Cheers.

				I thought of the same thing, but a P.O box and fake I.D. is not worth the hassle. While I am scared to order to australia, I&#039;d say its safer just to get it mailed to like a mate that you can trust.

				yeah none of my close mates live out of home either unfortunately. to be honest if i had my own place i would just get it ordered there because it would be almost impossible for customs to prosecute as anyone can get mail sent to someones house. and they know that too, which is why all small orders are generally just &#039;lost&#039; as the cops would lose way too much money on an investigation they would most likely lose

				I guess that&#039;s a risk you&#039;ll have to take if you want to use SR, either set up an Australia Post PO Box with or without a fake ID and hope for the best, or hope that your parents respect your privacy. I live at home and I&#039;m yet to have anyone go snooping through my mail, so I guess I&#039;m lucky in that sense.<br /><br />You could always send yourself a few letters and make up a story like &quot;Oh I subscribed to a website and they send me X every so often&quot;. Then if your parents open up the first few, you can just have some made-up newsletter or brochures in there so after a while they just expect for you to be getting mail.

				I guess the only way to get caught with the PO box though is if they find out that it is a false address, or if they wait at the box for you to retrieve the mail. it would be good to hear from someone who owns a PO box to see what would entail when you actually get a box. Ie if they contact you at all once you have it set up.<br /><br />In terms of the newsletter that isnt a bad idea. do you import at all or just source locally? have you ever had any packages go &#039;missing&#039;?

That&#039;s of course up to the vendor as if they&#039;ll bother to go to that length and it would probably cost you more.

				Yeah i think that its illegal for people to open your mail without &#039;reasonable grounds of suspicion&#039; or something like that. Has the blotter been concealed well or would it be obvious that there was tabs there if the letter was opened?

				If it was opened it would be obvious, but every dealer is different in how they package their goods and I&#039;ve found that most dealers have been accommodating when I&#039;ve gone to them asking for clarification on something or my PGP encryption has fucked up, so I&#039;m sure asking for some extra stealth won&#039;t lead to them getting shitty with you.

				I&#039;ll do some advertisement for my thread Mail Forwarding and Virtual Office Providers - Concept and Thoughts ( http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143742 )<br />I just want to say as a short preface my intention with this post is not to make this sound overly complicated, I just want to go through all possible scenarios.<br /><br />So these are the current ones for Australia:<br /><br />Mail Forwarders: http://www.hotsnail.com.au/ - http://www.mailnetwork.com/city/hurstville - http://www.passthepost.com.au/ - http://www.keepingyouposted.com.au/ - http://www.mail4ward.com.au/<br />Virtual Office Providers: http://www.alliancevirtualoffices.com/australia-virtual-offices - http://www.eoffice.net/australia.html - http://www.healyconsultants.com/company-services/australia-virtual-office.html - http://www.servcorp.com.au/virtual-offices - http://www.sosmail.com.au/ - http://www.regus.com/virtual-office/australia<br /><br />Now the focus according to me should be getting the package itself inside the country as domestic has a considerable lower risk than international. With a fake ID you would most likely never be able to collect the post in person without a valid ID (if it is indeed possible without an ID that would obviously help a lot) but most providers have no trouble re-sending post to a different person and address.<br /><br />Now to get down to business. Firstly one would obviously have to acquire a fake ID, this can be done in the Forgeries section on Silk Road: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/category/150<br />Next is to register at any of those vendors I listed above or any other vendor who is equivalent to them. It would be interesting to hear specifics from someone in Australia attempting this with the following information from any specific vendor:<br /><br />* What kind of personal information are they asking for?<br />* Is the service for Australians only or is it open for international as well?<br />* What kind of ID verification are they asking for?<br />* What systems do they have for receiving payments?<br />* How expensive is the specific service in question in terms of monthly subscription/re-sending post etc. ?<br />* Does it work?&nbsp; :D<br /><br />As I mentioned in my previous thread as far as I&#039;m aware there is no way that I&#039;m aware of yet not having to sign for a package using this way, it&#039;s possible it differs from the US but I&#039;ve found no information which points to it. Lastly one should keep in mind sooner or later a package might get caught and one should keep the following in mind then:<br /><br />* Their system will track the address used to resend the package, this would get handed over to the police without question most likely.<br />* If a fake ID has been used and they find out the state will usually see that as a quite major crime in itself, however they will have no easy way of proving you&#039;ve done this short of finding concrete information linking you to it (hopefully no one is stupid enough to use their own credit card for paying for example).<br />* While it&#039;s highly unlikely there&#039;s a very small possibility that Australian customs could let a package go through on purpose to see what address it goes to. Even if customs itself doesn&#039;t notice anything a vacuum seal could break at the mail forwarder thus making an employee there report it to the police.<br /><br />Hopefully I didn&#039;t miss any major point, anyone who attempts this (perhaps even legally at first to see how the system works) please post in the thread http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161081.msg1143742 with any information you&#039;ve found out. :)

				Too expensive, too much hassle, too sketchy. Not that much benefit from it. Just be patient; wait to find a reliable place for deliveries.
