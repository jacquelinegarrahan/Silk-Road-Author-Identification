				<br /><br />Hey just a quick shout to say hello. I&#039;m a newbie for sure, just made my tails live bootable usb stick yesterday, got some bitcoins and sent my first deposit so I&#039;m stoked, but I am a little concerned with how long it&#039;s taking for my deposit to show up. I checked it out at blockchain and it looks good with 21 confirmations and I&#039;m still at a $0.00 balance.&nbsp; I made the deposit around 3 hours ago.

				Did you read the other thread? Because of the attacks and some new code or something or other, there was a bit of a problem with deposits. It&#039;s all sorted now, after 6 confirmations the BTC should appear. You can use blockchain.info to check up on the transaction too, just put your address in the search box. Good luck mate. Peace

				Oh yeah, I&#039;ve been through all of that.&nbsp; I&#039;ve&nbsp; checked it on blockchain too, and it has over 231 confirmations now. Still not funded in my account though. There&#039;s a thread in the support forum where another guy is having the same problem, so logic would dictate that someone has had this happen before. I&#039;d love to hear from someone who has been through it and find out if it ever got resolved to their satisfaction.

				I believe I read somewhere that the process can be slower during off hours, such as weekends/night time in modern world.&nbsp; Three hours is nothing though,&nbsp; my first SR deposit (over a year ago) took about 5 hours, has been around 1 or 2 for most others since.

				Who, me? No that still hasn&#039;t been resolved yet. My deposit showed up and then disappeared so...it&#039;s possible I was compromised. Support did finally send me a note back, but I was encouraged to send another one, so I did. Still waiting to hear back on that.<br /><br />I&#039;m leaning toward thinking now that someone got access to my account and stole that first .45BTC I deposited. I hope not, but deep down I think that&#039;s probably what happened. It will&nbsp; be a pleasant surprise ifI find out they discover it&#039;s something else and I ever see those coins again.<br /><br />Having said all that, the happy news is that I&#039;ve stopped using that account, made a new one and everything has worked great with it. Deposits show up just fine and everything works like it should.

There used to be some good weed floating around this area but for the past 20 years or so it&#039;s mostly cheap Mexican stink weed, and when you do find anything I&#039;d consider even mid-grade, it costs as much or more than SR prices for top shelf stuff. If all continues to go well, I&#039;ll be seeing you all on The Road&nbsp; a whole lot. ;)

				It is great when the road is running well, hopefully they&#039;ve put a stop to this prick who&#039;s been attacking, if it is possible to stop it on a hidden site, with a user from a changeable IP address.

I take testosterone replacement as well, but that&#039;s prescribed. I still might start buying that here on The Road too though, because it&#039;s actually less expensive than at the pharmacy. I paid $115.00 for the last vial that lasts ten weeks. That same vial here on The Road is around $40.00. I&#039;m at least buying one vial of it here so I can make up that $50.00 in BTC I&nbsp; lost,&nbsp; hahaha.

				Many moons ago I used to take steroids when I was a gym boy, but occasionally me and my mate got ripped off and were sold things like vegetable oil and nonsense like that. Didn&#039;t do any harm, buy also, didn&#039;t help with building muscle! Am I to assume you&#039;re prescribed it for a medical reason that isn&#039;t to do with muscle growth? The road seems to be reliable for most things, but I read yesterday that someone was sold &quot;coca leaf tea&quot;, which apparently turned into plain old just &quot;tea&quot; in the post! What I mean is, he was ripped off, apparently, apparently being the key word in the phrase. Can you tell if what you&#039;re getting is legit? I imagine it&#039;s harder than if buying weed or heroin. Also, have you looked at any of the foreign pharmacy websites for buying your testosterone?

				<br />Yes, I take the testosterone replacement because my levels are very low and that was causing me to be fatigued, killed my sex drive and caused&nbsp; me to be depressed and moody.&nbsp; I saw the commercials on TV...you know the ones where they ask you if you&#039;ve been depressed, fatigued, moody, low sex drie, and then sell you on the Androgel? Well I got my doctor to check, and sure enough, my testosterone levels were very low. I was surprised when the doctor prescribed injections though instead of the cream. My levels were pretty low. So far, I&#039;ve been taking the shots for a month and I feel so much better. I really do feel like a new man.<br /><br />You have a good point about the quality of the products bought on the black market. You&#039;re right! You really don&#039;t know what you&#039;re getting, so I will probably just stick to picking up my prescription and paying full retail for it. The foreign pharmacies are an option, but I&#039;ve heard the same thing about them...you just can&#039;t be sure of what you&#039;re getting.<br /><br />SOMEWHERE though, I am making up that $50.00 in lost BTC!!!

				Really sorry to hear that mate, still, lets look to the future and hope it doesn&#039;t happen again, eh?&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to try out two new vendors this week. New to me, not to the Road. My regular vendor has been having various problems and pulled his listings for the third time in 2 weeks. His product was excellent in every way, even the price was great for what it was, the most powerful gear I had ever sampled! So now, it&#039;s like there&#039;s a drought in UK for top quality gear, so I&#039;ve bitten the proverbial bullet and ordered from The Nether-regions. Apparently it can be difficult getting gear through UK customs from the dreaded Netherlands. Let&#039;s hope we&#039;re both lucky from now on. I thought I was the most unluckiest customer on SR. With me, the BTC site will crash as I&#039;m buying them, then SR will be being attacked, then it&#039;ll be working but my vendor will have pulled his listings, etc etc etc. For the first time, everything is running smoothly *touch wood* (besides the low strength of the gear) , I hope it is for you too mate. Remember the spare coins thread if you&#039;re stuck. This community never ceases to amaze me and make me smile.

I must have missed that message about your coins, I saw that you opened a new account, sorry to hear that you got diddled mate. I just looked through the thread, have you since been told that there&#039;s no hope for your coins? There was that problem with the code, I have no idea where that thread is now, have you asked if there was no chance DPR lost them for you? And not to sound patronizing, but have you checked the address you sent them to, checked to see there&#039;s not possibly one digit different?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes. I do have a partner. :) My luck with that first deposit though was just about as bad as it gets. There is no getting that back, it has been confirmed and checked in every way.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, look at the bright side. That was only about 50-60$. Other people have lost 800$ like that.

				It really isn&#039;t much of a conciliation, knowing that someone else lost more money. In most cases, if someone lost $800 compared to mr miller&#039;s $50, they probably had more money to lose in the first place. It&#039;s relative. People die every day, but if I break my leg, knowing that won&#039;t make my leg feel any better.

				You speak the truth, Sir. The $50.00 isn&#039;t really that big of a deal, but it did really bother me when I realized what happened.&nbsp; It all worked out in the end. I have a new secure account and everything is working just fine now.<br /><br />Yeah, it cost me $50.00 more than it should have, but in the end, the convenience of Silk Road alone is worth that, not to mention the added value of being able to avoid face-time with many of the the unsavory characters you have to deal with in order to get some of the wares sold on that site. :) <br />

				I agree, standing on street corners in the rain or snow for an hour waiting for a dealer who may or may not show up is no picnic either. The escrow system is great, you can gauge how reliable a vendor is from the feedback, and it seems that the vendors on here care, for their reputation and for customer satisfaction. I can saw without doubt, they are a different breed from the ones I used to know and sometimes work for. This system is great, I can&#039;t believe it took me so long to find.
