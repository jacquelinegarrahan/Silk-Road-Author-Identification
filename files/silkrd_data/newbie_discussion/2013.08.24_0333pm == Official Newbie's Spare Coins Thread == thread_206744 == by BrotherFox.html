				Welcome to The Official Newbie&#039;s Spare Coin Thread.<br /><br />some people have spare coins and a good heart. I thought it was be easier for Newbies to ask to borrow 0.XX BTC <br /><br />Here are some rules for the Topic.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ll Please Read The Rules. Don&#039;t Take Advantage Of This Post. ll <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />1) Any Member Can Ask For Coins.<br />2) Don&#039;t take advantage.<br />3) Please leave your Silk Road Username so people know were to send the BTC.<br />4) Give a estimate of how long it would take you to pay it back.<br />5) Know your limits when asking. ( Nothing Stupid Like 2 BTC. )<br />6) This post is for if you are short of a Order like 0.XX BTC.<br />7) Keep all communication in this Thread so we can track who&#039;s lent coins. <br />8) Enjoy this topic. :D<br /><br />Do not send BTC to new users registered the same day as they could be Scamming. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; List Of Users Lent BTC :<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do Not Lend BTC To These User&#039;s<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Why would anyone lend money? Silk Road and BTC are based on anonymity, so it&#039;s a huge risk to &quot;trust&quot;<br />anyone. Especially without any interest. I&#039;m sorry, but this won&#039;t work.

				I am much less of a newbie than my 3 posts would imply, but I have only posted on these forums 3 times so i&#039;m coming here for help. If anyone can spare a little coin (i need .2 but realize that is a lot to ask for) I will pay back in approximately a weeks time,&nbsp; I&#039;m in need do to some poor math and my normal btc supplier being out of my country and out of reach. send coin to mirrors2695 please
