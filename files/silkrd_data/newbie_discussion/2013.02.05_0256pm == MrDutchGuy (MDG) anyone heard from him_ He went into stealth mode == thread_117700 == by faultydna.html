				what ever that means over a week ago and since he is MIA (at least to me he is MIA). Said he would still provide to existing customers and referred customers but ever since then I have not heard from him. My order sat in processing for over a week so I had to cancel it. This really sucks because a) his prices were great b) only provider of Fentanyl powder that I know of c) product was amazing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve tried to message him and email him at tormail.org address but no response in over a week. <br /><br />Anyone know what happened to him or another source for fent powder?&nbsp; I&#039;ve searched but can only find patches, blotter and way over priced IV. Nothing I&#039;m really interested in.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sure wish I could post on the regular part of the forums where people who use MDG would see this. I need 30 posts? Is that correct?

				yeah, i feel exactly like you, but exactly.<br /><br />if you think about it: my only hope is - that he has to get it or prduce it. and remember he had super alot... and if i where him, i wouldnt care about my SR account and messeges if&nbsp; im in laboratory-mode! product done, hit SR.<br /><br />so maybe thats the reason.<br /><br />greets!<br /><br />Modify: i think you need 50 but im not sure. kind of hard rule 20 would be enough... but since that rule, everybody knows &quot;Newbie&quot; section is the hot spot. believe me.<br />greets, take fent care and be good!<br />
