				It is getting hard, fast, if you are new, to use the site at all.&nbsp; You will be offered up for scammers, pay commission to SR in the process.&nbsp; Be told &quot;NEVER do this act (FE)&nbsp; and then the site is rife with Vendors who use it as a regular part of their approach.&nbsp; Some target newbies (you and technically me) while maintaining great financial and otherwise, relationships with their older, wiser and predictably more wily buyers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not at all...well... you.&nbsp; So go slow! read everything you can find.&nbsp; Vendors Profile is their advertisement.&nbsp; Rumor mill has often the opposing or corroborating evidence.&nbsp; Learn to read reviews for authenticity.&nbsp; There is much power there to keep from getting scammed.&nbsp; Order small but make it worth the Vendors while.&nbsp; Few will tell you that either.&nbsp; Encryption, learn it, it, to ME, has been a nightmare. Others seem to get it right away.&nbsp; It will add 2 things&nbsp; Cache to you as a buyer, 2.&nbsp; Some vendors require it.<br />&nbsp; bueno suerte

				Sorry forgot Bitcoin.&nbsp; Start by setting up an account with Coinbase.com.&nbsp; First month kind of sucks, similar run-around as ALL the rest.&nbsp; The #) days in,&nbsp; you can do INSTANT ones from you ban acct.!&nbsp; Rockstar treatment.&nbsp; Just be cool, they are all a little nervous because they are aware of some of the current uses of&nbsp; BC.

				I use virwox (which accepts paypal/cc) and use a fog service to &quot;launder&quot; it so there&#039;s not a direct connection from the paypal account in my name to silk road

				https://bittylicious.com/ i&#039;ve found easiest<br /><br />Also as a newb on SR iv found NEVER FINALIZE EARLY UNLESS YOU&#039;RE SURE THE VENDOR IS LEGIT AND A STAND UP GUY, quite a lot of pricks on here target new buyers and maintain good feedback with their older customers whilst ripping newbs off, and when we&#039;ve FE&#039;d, there&#039;s nothing we can do.
