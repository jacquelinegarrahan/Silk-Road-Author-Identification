				Bumping this to see who else on the east coast has buds. <br /><br />I appreciate brownpurple31 suggestion and he looks like a vendor I&#039;ll be trying out as I appreciate the fact that he sells small quantities.&nbsp; Not much into indica though as I&#039;m a day time smoker.&nbsp; <br /><br />Who else ships from the east coast and sells personal amounts of say Green crack, Sour Diesel, Lamb&#039;s Breath or something like it?&nbsp; Any good sativa will do.&nbsp; Thanks.

				I was just wondering about this today myself.<br />I am looking for small amounts of weed, and have gotten some great stuff from the west coast, but would like to possibly decrease order to receive time. One of the west coast vendors was pretty quick, so it also depends on how fast they handle it. I will look into the two listed here to see what&#039;s up.

				Good Sativa is hard to find on SR on either coast.&nbsp; You can find it but it often disappears quickly.&nbsp; I want to try a strong sativa but haven&#039;t yet figured out who to order from.&nbsp; Just want a cheap sample to try out first.

				Hey guys I&#039;m a newbie to SR from the Tri-State Area on the East Coast and I&#039;m looking for all types of East Coast vendors with different products for sale. I want to stick to the east coast because I only want to wait one day for my goodies to arrive! Help me out guys by suggesting more members and vendors. Can I possibly meet up with them in real life because I really looking for a connection so I can supply my friends with goodies and make a little coin for myself. Let me know if you or anyone you know can help! Thanks!

				hey so i wanted to update the thread with things ive learned after 30+ packages in a little less than 2 months<br /><br />- it is less about the vendors location than it is about the actual vendor and the vendors processing time. fast shipping is useless if they take 3 days to process<br />- of all my packages, i&#039;ve never gotten anything sooner than 2 days. my west coast weed purchases usually come within 2-3 days if i use the right vendor<br /><br />all in all, do your research on the vendor, try them out and see who meets your needs the best<br /><br />also at first i was a little apprehensive about international orders, and i receive these in 5-7 days tops

				i ordered a sample from anywherebutnorcal when he started and for guerrilla grown bud his stuff is quite good. i got his kali mist and his panama. i grow but don&#039;t have the time and space to do long flowering sats so i grabbed a sample to try him. The km was decent and i would say it&#039;s worth at least checking out. i REALLY enjoyed the Panama great happy smoke that was a great way to start teh day. my wife gets knocked out even by sat doms like jack herer, ak 47, and blue dream if she takes more than two hits. she had a few off a joint in the morning and stayed awake and had a great time.
