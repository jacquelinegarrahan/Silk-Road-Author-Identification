				I have a quandry...<br /><br />I have been using Coinbase to purchase Bitcoins. <br /><br />I bought transferred and used 24 Bitcoins on SR so far from them in the last month.<br /><br />Two Weeks ago 7 Bitcoins I did not purchase were added to my Coinbase account.<br /><br />Its been two weeks and Coinbase has not charged me for the 7 bitcoins I did not purchase.<br /><br />I transferred them to SR and they increased in value a great deal (from 14.40 to 19.50!!)<br /><br />I want to use them to make a purchase but...<br /><br />I am worried about Bad Karma and the Ethical question of spending bitcoins that I did not pay for!!<br /><br />What does everyone think!!<br /><br />All opinions welcome...

				It would bother me probably if that happened to me as well.&nbsp; Maybe just email them and ask?&nbsp; Is it possible someone else put in your wallet number by accident and they lost their BTC as a result?

				You could only pay it forward. The nature of bitcoin means that it isn&#039;t easily traceable, so it&#039;s almost impossible to return a payment to the same person. <br /><br />There is a thread on the main forums for extra bitcoins. People sometimes get caught out with postage and are .01 coins short...you can earn some good karma there just helping out a few people and you&#039;ll still end up way ahead financially.

				I agree with the Bigjc. Technically the bit coins are highly untraceable and I would def space some fractions of bitcoins to people who are short for an order because of fluctuation or improper math skills in total calculation.<br /><br />
