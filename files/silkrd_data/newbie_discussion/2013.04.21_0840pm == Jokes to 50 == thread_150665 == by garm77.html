				A duck walks into a bar and asks the bartender for corn. The bartender says &quot;We have no corn, get out of here.&quot; So the duck leaves. The next day he comes back and asks for corn again, and the bartender says &quot;I told you, we don&#039;t have any corn! Get out!&quot; So the duck leaves. The next day he goes in again and asks for corn, and the bartender says, &quot;For the last time, we don&#039;t have corn! If you ever come back, I&#039;m going to nail those webbed feet of yours to the floor!&quot; So the duck leaves. The next day the duck comes and asks, &quot;Do you have any nails?&quot; The bartender says, &quot;No, of course not. Why would a bar have nails?&quot; The duck then says, &quot;Good. Can I have some corn?

				The boss returned from lunch in a good mood and called the whole staff in to listen to a couple of jokes he had picked up. Everybody, but one girl laughed uproariously. <br /><br />&quot;What&#039;s the matter?&quot; grumbled the boss. &quot;Haven&#039;t you got a sense of humor?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t have to laugh,&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#039;m leaving Friday.&quot; <br /><br /><br />

				A man is flying in a hot air balloon and realizes he is lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts, &quot;Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?&quot;<br />The man below says: &quot;Yes. You&#039;re in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;You must work in Information Technology&quot; says the balloonist.<br /><br />&quot;I do&quot; replies the man. &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well&quot; says the balloonist, &quot;Everything you have told me is technically correct, but it&#039;s no use to anyone.&quot;<br /><br />The man below says, &quot;You must work in business.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I do&quot; replies the balloonist, &quot;but how did you know?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; says the man, &quot;You don&#039;t know where you are, or where you&#039;re going, but you expect me to be able to help. You&#039;re in the same position you were before we met, but now it&#039;s my fault.&quot;
