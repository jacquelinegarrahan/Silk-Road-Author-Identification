				Hi<br /><br />Basically I am wondering about the feedback system and what is good vs fair.<br /><br />I like nice coke. When i began buying coke in the 90&#039;s it was basically always good. I mean the stuff smelt strong, it was lovely and about half the price of today.<br /><br />So I have had some nice gear from one or two vendors here. I got some which was a bit cheaper and it was basically like street coke is today pretty much. You get a buzz but it&#039;s short lived and not really what you hoped for. I wonder what else, then spectulate too much about what it&#039;s cut with and it ruins what little buzz there is a bit.<br /><br />Anyway so to the point - my first instinct was to just leave good feedback because I don&#039;t want to upset the vendor and he has a lot of good feedback so I thought ahh maybe I am being too picky. Then I thought nah I will say what I think, without having had a test, just say its not the best coke and and I wonder what it&#039;s cut with. I did this but thought hang on am I being unfair? This guy has to sell this and he&#039;s not lying to anyone. He is not claiming that its the finest fishscale etc. I might be wrong but I reckon there was a bit of speed in there.<br /><br />Without knowing what the vendor thinks he&#039;s selling it&#039;s hard to be too judgemental and plenty seem to like it. If you were going out drinking, to a club to dance and you had a bit you would get a buzz and enjoy it. If you are a bit of a greedy guts for really nice coke and that certain something nothing else will give you then you are gonna be a bit gutted.<br /><br />SO - say what you think in feedback and damn consequences or be a bit more considered and just don&#039;t buy from them again.<br /><br />Obviously in ideal world one would sort out a test.<br /><br />Lastly the big question - if someone sells pretty rubbish coke and you slag it off then, can you get black listed? Say if you give 5/5 but still slag it off what then?<br /><br />I am hoping that I trod the right line of noting my displeasure with the product without affecting this person&#039;s business too much, cos i like to think he/she would like to only buy and sell quality.<br />

				My view is, you have to be honest, and at the same time you have to give the vendor every benefit of the doubt. Just explain precisely your experience, and be sure to include the good with the bad. I would also weigh the price/performance of the drug rather than simply the performance. Crappy coke at 50 a gram might be a fantastic bargain, and usually if a vendor is selling crappy coke the price reflects that.
