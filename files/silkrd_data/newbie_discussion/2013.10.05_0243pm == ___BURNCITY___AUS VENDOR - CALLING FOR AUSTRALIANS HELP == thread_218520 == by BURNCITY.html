				Hello to all my Aussie comrades...<br /><br />We are not active on the SR forums but most of you all know us as BURNCITY and know our extensive listings of speed paste, meth, synthetic weed, NBome blotters, xanax etc. After what has happened<br /><br />In light of these recent events we have been struck quite hard as we had a fairly large amount of BTC stored on SR as well as coins in escrow. Which is why we are asking our loyal customers for help. (Please no randoms)<br /><br />We need a loan of 2 bitcoins to get our store up and running on both BMR and Sheep but as we had majority of our earnings on SR they are now stuck in limbo and am very unsure (certain) we will ever see them again.<br /><br />Send to 17wusQR8242qbE8iiM7sYssN2JNwwCQ86u<br /><br />Anybody willing to make this sacrifice and help us out will be reimbursed generously as for anyone who makes this loan will in turn receive either &#039;0.5 gram of meth&#039; or &#039;1.5 grams of our speed paste&#039;. Those are PER COIN so if you loan us 2 we can double that or we can give you something else with some of our other listings.<br /><br />Once our store is set up, you will receive your initial loan back and we will hook you up again on your first order with us, bigtime.<br /><br />In a time of crisis such as this we really need some support from our customer base, or any other Australians willing to lend a helping hand to our sinking ship...<br /><br />Anyone willing to make a contribution please send us an email at burncity@Safe-mail.net letting us know and then we can sort out your shipment.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />BC<br /><br />P.S Anybody who received thier order from us but did not get a chance to finalize...Do not feel bad and enjoy the product to the fullest in this dark time. Hope to see you guys over at BMR and Sheep.
