				Any idea on how to boost you sales.<br /><br />I’m selling a really god product at an awesome price, but imp still waiting for my first sale. <br />Just a quick overview what im dealing with. I have taken pictures of the product from my seller’s official webpage. (Steroids) and posted them under each item. I have offered it at half price. Large review about each product. Its produced in Scandinavian and I only ship to Europe. Am I doing anything wrong or is SR simply not the place for steroids in Europe. I have no problem shipping to USA, but I think it properly just get seized in customs.<br />Any ideas?<br />

				Open up your sales to beyond Europe. If you can package well, you can ship anywhere. I don&#039;t think US customs scrutinizes EU stuff too much, but it depends on which country you&#039;re shipping from.<br /><br />How do your prices compare to other sellers of the same product?<br /><br />You might want to sell smaller sample-sized quantities. Sometime people have 1btc left, and they can spend it on your gear, giving you some feedback.<br /><br />Perhaps consider listing some other non-steroid items that you know will sell just to build up some reputation.

				Add your vendor page to your signature.<br />Get active on the forums. The newbie section is a great place to start a vendor review thread and find new customers.

				best way to boost sales is to lower your prices and offer small amounts. i&#039;m not sure about steroids though as i imagine most people come here for drugs. pretty sure you can get the roids from your local gym for much less than you would on here

				Free samples and cheap prices to get the ball rolling, then once you have 25 plus sales and have proven you&#039;re legit and know what you&#039;re doing the buyers should flood in! I&#039;m thinking about opening a vendor account in the next fortnight! Getting excited, been mailing drugs for years but just teaching myself the ins and outs of cashing out before I start to operate&nbsp; :)
