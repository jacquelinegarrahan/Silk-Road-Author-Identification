				<br />I am completely new to this.&nbsp; I have brought the bitcoins I needed then went to deposit them on my account here.&nbsp; I copied and pasted the address into the make payment section on local bitcoins, and then sent them.&nbsp; Is there anything else I need to do because the bitcoins have gone from my local bitcoins account but my account here still says zero?<br /><br />Thanks<br />

				I like to first send my bought bitcoins to my wallet, then send them to SR. <br />I can see how many confirmations are left on the transaction when I use my wallet.

				When you transfer BTC, it has to be confirmed through the blockchain, which takes a while.<br /><br />And then, on top of that, you&#039;ve got the SR tumbler to go through, which takes a bit longer.<br /><br />Bitcoin is not the fastest currency in the world, but it&#039;s pretty thoroughly anonymous...

And then they get nothing. I&#039;m not telling you that every vendor that requires fe from new buyers is trying to rip you off, just that you can find a vendor out there that will let you keep the money in escrow, until you receive product.<br /><br /><br />DON&#039;T FINALIZE EARLY IS THE POINT HERE. Hope this helps.
