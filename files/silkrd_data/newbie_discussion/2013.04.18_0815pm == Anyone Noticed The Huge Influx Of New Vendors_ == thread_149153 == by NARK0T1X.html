				thats crazy, just be careful an dont ask me how I know but LE is collecting vendor and buyer accounts, I really havnt been trusting to get anything from a brand new vendor, I know its not very fair but I am super paranoid and like to go with my instincts, i just want to let people know somehow, just sketched cause i know they are watching&nbsp; :-X

				The number of vendors are viewable on the main Silk Road page. Yea I&#039;m with you buddy I&#039;m only using vendors who I can trust. With my luck I&#039;d roll the dice on a new vendor with persuasive price schemes and end up in cuffs. Thanks for the heads up!!

				There might be a spike for 420 and Bicycle Day? But with that, I&#039;d definitely watch for scammers. It&#039;s a shame that new legitimate vendors have to work so hard to gain trust because of all the douchebags in the world.

				Generally the more vendors the better, but I&#039;m always quite wary about being one of the very first to order from anyone new. It helps when they have pics with their username and detailed descriptions of their products.

				Let other people do the work for you, stick with reputable vendors until the new people become a foothold in the community.<br /><br />

				True shit from everyone, I also wondered if LE was operating a vendor site, do you think in their pictures most of the drugs would be sealed or something? Like for example not be able to just be held blatently in their hands or something? Lol I know its not really that big a issue, I am just naturally paranoid
