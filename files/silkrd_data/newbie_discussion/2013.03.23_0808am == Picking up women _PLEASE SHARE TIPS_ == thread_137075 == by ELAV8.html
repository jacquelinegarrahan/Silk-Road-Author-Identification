				Have you read Roosh V? He posts free quality stuff online, and his books aren&#039;t expensive either. http://www.rooshv.com<br />Nowadays he writes a lot about men&#039;s rights etc., but just browse a bit and you find the good stuff. He also has a forum, so you can get tons of info through that.<br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been getting into this stuff as well. From what I&#039;ve been reading the older pick up material is really weird. I&#039;ve been going to rsdnation.com. They have free videos and articles on their front page, makes sense to me, looks legit.

				A little psychology tip: Subtly imitating people makes them more confident in you.<br /><br />Example: You&#039;re at a bar, and you&#039;re talking to a woman there, you see she rests her two knuckles on the edge of the bar constantly. Do this for a few seconds, stop, do it again longer, and repeat. It shows compatibility and common interests which usually leads to attraction.<br />It applies to everything. The way their eyebrows raise when they laugh, the way they pronounce, or deliver their sentences. <br /><br />Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.&nbsp;

				Coming from a woman...<br />The most attractive thing for me is when a guy knows he can be on his own/isn&#039;t trying to hard.<br />What I mean is-- don&#039;t keep talking to the same woman if she&#039;s not giving you the time of day- it isn&#039;t worth it.<br />When a guy attempts to have an actual conversation with me instead of staring at my tits or being obnoxious and overbearing; it&#039;s a breath of fresh air. Humor goes a long way-- as does charm. No, I don&#039;t mean smelling her hair and whispering that she smells good or &quot;daaaamn gurrrrl, your ass looks fine in that dress&quot;. But a genuine compliment like &quot;Blue is a good color for you&quot; works really well. Mostly because it&#039;s only hinting at that you think she&#039;s beautiful rather than smashing her on the head with it. <br /><br />If you want to know anything specific, let me know<br />

				Confidence is of utmost importance. If your going bald either shave your head which alot of women love or get implants. If your confidence is low because you havnt gotten laid in awhile your gonna need to start somewhere if its been awhile since ive been out ill go out to the bar and just go around saying hi and giving the look to girls i know are not in my leauge ( of a lesser leauge then myself) when you have several girls say hi back and smile your confidence will go up then I start going upto girls I would be interested in and with high energy I come up to them with an introduction of myself and or my wing man if im not alone a good wing man can be very important too but thats besides the point then just simple whats your name where you from whod you come here with what do you do, &quot;so how do you not have a boyfriend&quot; I like also for introductions I like &quot;what did you say your name is?&quot; in the form of a question it kinda throws them off and kinda forces them to anwser they might say I didnt say then i reply with are you about to? and smile if at this point they say no they are not interested and keep it moving. Its all pretty simple once you get into the flow

Get some hair plugs, go to the gym, maybe get rid of your mantits and huge gut.&nbsp; Self improvement works wonders. <br /><br />Maybe find a hobby that will make you an interesting human being that is worth spending time with. <br /><br />Do lots of drugs like mescaline, peyote LSD and shrooms to expand your mind...to really break the broken paradigms and fail that have gotten you to the point where you have to ask anonymous strangers on how to interact with members of the opposite sex of your own species.&nbsp; <br /><br />OR.... get a prostitute. Its the same thing since that&#039;s how you think of women anyway, but instead of spending time on pickup lines and drinks you can just buy her time. If you get tired of that, go back to option 1. <br /><br />The key here, friend, is your goal. Is it temporary pussy or to become a person that is confident and interesting enough to attract the ladies. It&#039;s up to you.&nbsp; <br />

				The simplest way to &quot;pick up&quot; women is simply to not try.<br />Be assertive. That is all.<br />Simply do not try.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how many women I&#039;ve managed to &quot;get with&quot; simply by not trying, and just going out and enjoying myself.

				Confidence, take charge, and make them laugh. If you&#039;re not exciting, they won&#039;t be interested in you. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to push a situation into the next level. Girls in most cases want are thinking the same way you are, they just know they don&#039;t have to do anything because guys throw themselves at girls. So if you&#039;re not throwing yourself at the girl you&#039;re speaking with, someone else will, and that will be the one banging her while you&#039;re out in the cold. That doesn&#039;t mean be an arrogant idiot though, you have put your foot forward though. <br /><br />An easy way to tell if a girl is interested in you is if shes rebounding your conversation. If shes just answering you and not progressing the conversation, move along, shes not interested.

Take a shower.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This ^^. (I lost my custom arrows and symbols! :( ) Simple, really. :) Also, when you go out, you need to shower, use antiperspirant (don&#039;t use deodorant, it reveals you as being.............. y o u n g.........., which might be a problem, there&#039;s a bit of a &quot;young boy&quot; thing about it, also it isn&#039;t very nice-smelling, also it doesn&#039;t stop you sweating, it just covers it up if you DO sweat) boys, rub some talc on you, clean your teeth, gel your hair if you like that kind of look (to appear more natural, simply apply 1-2 hours before leaving and use hot water to melt it off and dissipate, that will decrease hold but give it more of a natural, less slicked back look while at the same time giving hold).................... Jesus H. Christ................ I shouldn&#039;t have to write basic hygiene instructions out but you&#039;d be amazed at how many guys don&#039;t do ANY of this. And they wonder why they don&#039;t get picked up. Also, if you have to pick up a woman instead of it happening the other way around, something is wrong. If this is the case, pay attention to hygiene and how you act in the club.<br /><br />RE: funny. Depends on the type of girl, doesn&#039;t it. A great sense humor is......... great.......... ::) OTOH. You don&#039;t need to crack joke after joke after joke to pick her up. If you do, she&#039;s not worth it. :) <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137075.msg935802#msg935802">Quote from: Ron Swanson on March 25, 2013, 01:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">stop reading ebooks written by egotistical wankers and talk to some women. don&#039;t attempt to mask desperation with misogyny as many do, it will not help. wear a hat?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah I can back this up: I don&#039;t read dating books but I have seen some spam from authors, and they are so far up themselves it&#039;s not funny. Like I said above, if you are just being confident with nothing else to back it up then it won&#039;t help you at all. :) But talk to women and not books, get some tips from them if stuck, but just go out. Work out if possible (like ACE ::) ) , if you do then you&#039;ll be confident. If you&#039;re confident, it will flow a bit more easy. How can you be expected to pick up if you are not feeling right about image? Just eats away at confidence levels.

Its all pretty simple once you get into the flow<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />All of this good advice, apart from the &quot;so how do you not have a boyfriend&quot; bit, guys, that is a deal breaker, if you want to be rejected this is how it&#039;s done like a pro. ::) But the wing-man bit actually true, only, instead of wing-man, make it a wing-woman, it will improve your chances by maybe 50%. Yeah. You&#039;re fucking welcome. ;)<br /><br /><br />edit.................. im tired finish later.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I have bought a few of the pickup women E-BOOKS on the main site but they dont really work or women dont like my receding hair line, one of the 2. Any advice or surefire ways to pickup other than shouting the gear all night..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;If you treat woman like a robot by &quot;insert pickup line=swoon&quot; you will die alone. <br /><br />Try to improve your sad excuse for a life first. Get some hair plugs, go to the gym, maybe get rid of your mantits and huge gut.&nbsp; Self improvement works wonders. <br /><br />Maybe find a hobby that will make you an interesting human being that is worth spending time with. <br /><br />Do lots of drugs like mescaline, peyote LSD and shrooms to expand your mind...to really break the broken paradigms and fail that have gotten you to the point where you have to ask anonymous strangers on how to interact with members of the opposite sex of your own species.&nbsp; <br /><br />OR.... get a prostitute. Its the same thing since that&#039;s how you think of women anyway, but instead of spending time on pickup lines and drinks you can just buy her time. If you get tired of that, go back to option 1. <br /><br />The key here, friend, is your goal. Is it temporary pussy or to become a person that is confident and interesting enough to attract the ladies. It&#039;s up to you. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>bbbbingo
