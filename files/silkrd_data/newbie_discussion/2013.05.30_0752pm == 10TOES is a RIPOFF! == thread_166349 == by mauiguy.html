				Levamisole is a VERY common cutting agent in the US.<br /><br />It is a pain in the ass to get out as well.&nbsp; most cut you can &quot;wash&quot; out.&nbsp; this has properties similar to coke so acetone or ethyl doesnt dissolve it<br /><br />it is a dewormer and lowers your immune system and can cause flesh eating bacteria(or is flesh eating bacteria I was confused by this)<br /><br />I have yet to find a coke dealer that is domestic that doesnt have levamisole in it.&nbsp; I have not tried Nods.<br /><br />If you have a Simon A-B reagent test, do the test on it.&nbsp; Pure levamisole is red, coke is clear(no reaction).&nbsp; Most tests will give u hues of Pink(presence of levamisole).&nbsp; the more vibrant the pink the more levamisole that is in it.

				Hi wraithe,&nbsp; How did you get test results for 10toes cocaine?&nbsp; I would love to be able to test my coke before I use it, or to find someone else who has tested it.&nbsp; Of course it would be particularly helpful to find out whether a batch has that damned levamisole in it.&nbsp; Do you know whether anyone has tested bcpltd&#039;s coke?&nbsp; My order arrived today and it is weird.&nbsp; It has practically no numbing effect for one thing.&nbsp; How can genuine cocaine not numb you?&nbsp; Even when I put it in my mouth, practically nothing.&nbsp; It is quite bitter but without much aroma.&nbsp; It does get you &#039;high&#039; to a certain extent, but what is producing the high I have no idea, because without numbing I don&#039;t see how it could be cocaine.&nbsp; Any light you could shed on this would be helpful.

				PineappleLove and a few others live in europe where drug testing is free.&nbsp; They take samples ordered anonymously and send them in to be labtested.&nbsp; <br /><br />For us US based guys we either have to go off what they find and assume it hasnt changed or get some EZ Tests and other reagents and test the product.<br /><br />EZ test Cut tests for levamisole, ephredin and phenyclin(sp)<br /><br />Marquis will show if theres ampehtamine in there<br />Simons AB will show if theres levamisole

Supposedly it is a common cut?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yeah this shit is everywhere. its in almost all cocaine now. <br /><br />i have seen mauiguy rip 10toes for this in a couple threads now. i hope he knows that its very unlikely 10toes is cutting there product. i have seen warnings about this cut all over the place. its on a bunch of harm reduction websites, hospitals, methadone clinics, newspapers/magazine articles. this is way to wide spread. it has to be getting cut by a major manufacturer or importer at the wholesale level. if mauiguy is doing cocaine on a regular basis then he is ingesting levamisole on a regular basis. he should be outting all the people he buys off of because so much of it is tainted with this cut. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Cocaine cut with the veterinary drug levamisole could be the culprit in a flurry of flesh-eating disease in New York and Los Angeles.<br />The drug, used to deworm cattle, pigs and sheep, can rot the skin off noses, ears and cheeks. And over 80 percent of the country&#039;s coke supply contains it.<br />&quot;It&#039;s probably quite a big problem, and we just don&#039;t know yet how big a problem it really is,&quot; said Dr. Noah Craft, a dermatologist with Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.<br />In a case study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, Craft describes six cocaine users recently plagued by the dark purple patches of dying flesh. And while they happened to hail from the country&#039;s coastlines, the problem is national.<br />&quot;It&#039;s important for people to know it&#039;s not just in New York and L.A. It&#039;s in the cocaine supply of the entire U.S.,&quot; Craft said.<br />Craft is one of several doctors across the country who have linked the rotting skin to tainted coke. The gruesome wounds surface days after a hit because of an immune reaction that attacks the blood vessels supplying the skin. Without blood, the skin starves and suffocates. <br />&nbsp;Eighty-two percent of seized cocaine contains levamisole, according to an April 2011 report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Why dealers would stretch their stash with levamisole instead of the more traditional fillers, like baking soda, is unclear, although studies in rats suggest the drug acts on the same brain receptors as cocaine. So it might be added to enhance or extend the cocaine&#039;s euphoric effects on the cheap. <br />Despite the widespread contamination, not all of the country&#039;s cocaine users experience the flesh-rotting reaction. It appears that some are more vulnerable to the tainted cocaine&#039;s effects<br />&nbsp;&quot;We don&#039;t know who this is going to happen to,&quot; said Dr. Lindy Fox, the University of California, San Francisco, dermatologist who first connected the gruesome lesions on cocaine users to levamisole. Similarly, some patients have more extreme reactions than others. Fox said she once saw a photo of a man whose entire body, face included, was black with dying flesh.<br />Once the drug is cleared from the body, the wounds do heal, leaving behind a shiny scar.<br />Although some people might be more vulnerable to the effects of levamisole, the drug doesn&#039;t discriminate based on race or socioeconomic status.<br />&quot;Rich or poor, black or white,&quot; anyone who uses cocaine is at risk, Craft said.<br />As if rotting skin wasn&#039;t enough, levamisole also prevents the bone marrow from producing infection-fighting white blood cells.<br />&quot;It&#039;s a little bit like having HIV,&quot; said Craft, adding that without medical attention, the condition can be fatal. &quot;About 10 percent of those patients will die from severe infections. They may be walking around like a time bomb.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think you&#039;re being a little harsh on him for selling coke cut with an incredibly common cut. isn&#039;t most coke cut at initial point of production? did you go to the vendor before posting here?
