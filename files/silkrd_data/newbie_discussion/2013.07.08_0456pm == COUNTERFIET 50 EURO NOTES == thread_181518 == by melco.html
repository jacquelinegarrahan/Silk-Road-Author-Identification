				Which is a damn shame. All of that talk about &quot;Silk Road not being about harming blahblahblah&quot; - in the case of counterfeit currency, it&#039;s more about the justice department and SS crawling up our asses. Which is still understandable. <br /><br />

				I do not understand why this is against the rules.<br />A lot of drugs are cut with crap and sold as being of superb quality. People who never used those drugs or have IRL connections might believe those are awesome products and vendors. There is no real quality control on, for example, &quot;counterfeit&quot; drugs.<br /><br />Asking 20 real euro&#039;s for 50 fake euro&#039;s is stupid though. Fake euro&#039;s get detected a lot. And if you use them and it gets detected you&#039;re in a lot of trouble which is not worth the 30 extra euro&#039;s.<br /><br />I agree that you&#039;d better not set up such a vendor account.

The most likely use of counterfeit currency is to purchase goods or services at small stores / from another regular person face-to-face. Those are not the entities that we want to be hurting.<br /><br />Libertas

				So what. If counterfeit money is not allowed here then it&#039;s only a matter of time before someone else sets up shop that does allow it. Economic principles are such that wherever there is a demand the supply will show up eventually. And a real black market where anything goes will come someday to tor and SR will slowly lose relevance as a once quaintly principled outlet. Dat der is mah prohecy.

However, DPR has decided not to permit counterfeit currency on the Silk Road marketplace; with Silk Road being a privately owned site, that is DPR&#039;s absolute right.<br /><br />Libertas

Consider this your first and last warning: If you attempt to sell any items again without first purchasing a vendor account, your account will be deleted. Counterfeit currency is a restricted item and can not be listed even if you do purchase vending privileges.<br /><br />Libertas

				Out here there are almost no shops who do not control every piece of paper to check if they are real.<br />So if they are not a 100% perfect copies, they will not be accepted in stores and people who even accidentally gives out a fake one in a store gets in pretty serieus trouble.<br /><br />Might be nice to rip off cocaine street dealers who rip u off&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />It is a little bit weird that this is not allowed on SR while counterfeit drugs, demanding to FE for bulk sales while the vendor spends $nothing to stash it and gains all the money to sell it, make a lot of moneyt if they use the escrow system and end up having to give a 50% refund on non arrival.<br />If they decide not to ship it then they got rich doing nothing.
