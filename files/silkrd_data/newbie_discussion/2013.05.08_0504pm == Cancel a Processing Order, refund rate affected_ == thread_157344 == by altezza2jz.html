				I&#039;m about to hit the cancel button on an order I placed with NorthwestDirect as soon as it becomes available, I&#039;ve never had this option before as all of the vendors I&#039;ve dealt with in the past always ship out the package in a timely manner.<br />Before I do so, I was wondering if my refund rate will become affected at all? I currently have a 0% refund rate and 0% auto-finalize rate, both of which I would like to keep that way.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a few good orders from NWD in the past, but they&#039;re off their game hardcore this time around. They don&#039;t even reply to my messages anymore. I&#039;d suggest everyone stay the hell away from them until they get their shit straight.

And instead they don&#039;t do things properly and get bad feedback and less customers. If I every decide to become a vendor, I&#039;m gonna have the best customer service on the entire site :)

				It won&#039;t affect anything but your relationship with the vendor.
