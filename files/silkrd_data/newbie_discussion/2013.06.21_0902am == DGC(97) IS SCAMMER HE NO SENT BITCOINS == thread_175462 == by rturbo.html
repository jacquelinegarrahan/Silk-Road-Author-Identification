				I know the DGC a long long time, buyed a lot of weed there.<br />But this thing here is very mysterious.<br />FE for every order? And some little arrivals only?<br /><br />For one or one and a half year, you could read about the arresting from the dgc. <br />Their own sides are down.<br />But i didn´t get infos now about whats happening to the DutchGreenClub.<br /><br />I paid for one gramm coke, no arrival since now.<br /><br />I think it could be a big big scam, only some guys take the great and trustworthy name of the DGC to take a lot of purchaser.

Lost, but couldn&#039;t care less. My intentions were to improve my refund rate, which got fucked by another vendor. <br />I than saw his C listings from &quot;the jungle&quot; and thought - how weird.<br />He later on upped a listing of C shipping from Europe and I took the plunge. His initial description didn&#039;t require FE. He requested that by PM. I refused, as it was never required in the first place, told him he only sold lottery tickets so far which is not enough for me to entrust him with my $. He replies he sells a lot of weed, I check the listings and he doesn&#039;t. He sold some hash, maybe. He says some winners left feedback already (I didn&#039;t ask him about that) check the listing and indeed it seems like one guy wins a lot (I mean that every feedback left by a supposed winner looks the same). I struggle and evt. he cancels my order. I know I don&#039;t have any proof, still it&#039;s shady as hell.<br />He updates about his upcoming vacations, they&#039;ll take place exactly when the C from the jungle is bound to arrive (poor choice of words as he never intended to ship shit). <br /><br />This is a massive carefully organized scam:<br />- DGC has a reputation on clearnet. He uses this as to sound more trustfull<br />- lotteries so to reach the required transaction count to be able to ask for early finalization + scam a (not really) little aside<br />- WU to BTC a scammers favorite <br />- vacation coincide with time when first C orders should be inbound&nbsp; <br />- the prices are so steep that his regular listings aren&#039;t really attractive. Nobody buys them, so he doesn&#039;t need to justify the missing wares. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;d really like to see the math. I wonder if this is equivalent to Tonys 420 sale in figures. <br /><br />This is of course not verified and purely hypothetical. Sarcasm meant.<br /><br />Cheers Jason

Are you saying he stole 10000€ from you? Holy cow. I&#039;m starting to believe it could be way bigger than Tony. <br /><br />Edit: I now understand he scammed you out of 1300€. Sorry for reading too hastily.<br />It confirms that he never ever intended to send any product, BTC or whatever he listed in the first place. This is huge. I will recap it later on. What a punk. <br /><br />Sorry for your loss mate

				He did me for a small order, I decided to try it out n give it a go, but no delivery and communication went dead when I started to hassle him for delivery details, I was sucked in by his menu listings of quality hash &amp; the prices to boot. It fucking drives me crazy being scammed like that but its my fault for showing good faith &amp; FE&#039;ing the fucker, now I want to kick him in the bollox. But its not all that bad, only small amount to test the water, &amp; now I will spread it about for everyone to know. DGC IS A SCAMMING CUNT.
