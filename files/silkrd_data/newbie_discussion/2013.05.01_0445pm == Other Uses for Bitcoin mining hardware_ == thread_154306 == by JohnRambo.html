				Hi all, I just bought a 50GH/s bitcoin miner, and I was wondering if there are any other uses you can put it to? Besides mining bitcoins, of course.<br /><br />The one I bought<br />https://products.butterflylabs.com/homepage/50-gh-s-bitcoin-miner.html<br /><br />With that much processing power, it&#039;s my assumption that it could be put to a whole range of uses.

				Unfortunately, no (with a slight caveat). These miners are based on ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). That means that the hardware components (circuitry) has been specifically designed for computing hashes, SHA-256 in this particular case. So, if you have another application that would require quickly computing SHA-256 hashes, then you could go and try to hack the firmware for the ASIC to do some other task, but it seems pretty impractical.

				Impractical or not, I am just asking, are there any other specific purposes or uses that the mining hardware can be used for?<br /><br />With that level of processing power, I bet it could do a lot.

				Like I said, the processing power is great, but only good for computing SHA-256 hashes. One possible application would be cracking SHA-256 hashes, but I don&#039;t think that the bandwidth for the bus going to the ASIC is wide enough. When you&#039;re dealing with mining, you have a single block to hash at a time with difference nonces. Cracking, on the other hand, you would have to process a crap ton of possible passwords.

				I would use it for mining bitcoins, I believe what above poster is saying is basically like this...<br /><br />Yes it is capable of focusing a lot of processing power, but only on one specific task or operation.<br /><br />I have no idea though.<br /><br />I wish I had one. <br /><br />Can I buy a % of yours mining capability?&nbsp; ;D

Let me first wait for it to arrive, one guy said his hasn&#039;t come yet and he ordered in January. Who knows, might take fucking months for the goddamn thing to arrive.
