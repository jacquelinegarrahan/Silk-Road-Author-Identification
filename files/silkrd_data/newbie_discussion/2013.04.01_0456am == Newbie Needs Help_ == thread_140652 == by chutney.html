				So, I&#039;m completely new to the playground- long time fan first time user and I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve already managed to get myself ripped off.&nbsp; I transferred my bitcoins to Silk Road about 30 minutes ago and they havent shown up.&nbsp; They&#039;ve disappeared from my original wallet but I can&#039;t find any record of them on my silk road account.&nbsp; How long do bitcoins take to transfer over?&nbsp; Is it supposed to be instant? Or am I stressing for nothing. :-[&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks guys x x

				No it&#039;s not instant. It can take up to 6 hours, sometimes longer on bad days. Be patient, if you did everything right they will show up.

				Yea SR tumbles coins before they deposit into your wallet. This is a security measure and takes a little time.

				The first time I transferred coins to SR was the same day the forums went down and then the site itself was down for several hours. Then my coins didn&#039;t show up. At the 24 hour mark I sent a message to the site admins and as soon as I clicked send I saw my coins come through. I immediately sent another message asking them to disregard.<br /><br />The second time took about 18 hours and the third took only about two hours.

				If you want to test it, I can give you my wallet number and you can tell me when you sent me bitcoins, then I&#039;ll let you know when I received them.&nbsp; That should give a pretty accurate time frame.&nbsp; J/k

				i suppose to help lose the trace from where they were orginally sent from further.although if i understand correctly you would need to move the coins into different wallets with differing amounts to lose the trail effectively.<br /><br />perhaps someone better qualified could confirm or not?
