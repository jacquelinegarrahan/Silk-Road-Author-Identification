				Hi all, i&#039;m new to both silk road and bitcoin and over the past few days i have been researching into ways in which to get hold of the latter, and for UK residents it seems pretty limited? Common methods that work in the U.S such as filling out MoneyGram slips or using sites like Dwolla do not seem to have a UK equivalent, and so i have been looking at options like the use of Mt.Gox through AurumXChange or at mail services like cash for btc that vendors like BTC4CASH UK provides. Neither has struck me as options that i would want to pursue, so if anyone could either convince me that these were viable methods or know of a better way to get hold of bitcoins in the UK i would be extremely grateful. I just want to finally purchase something! <br /><br />Cheers

				Yeah in the same boat Vivek; so much info to consume and understand it&#039;s hard to know what to do. Am currently using BTC4CASH UK to acquire a small amount so will post my review once deal is done. As a newbie its cash up front and hope you don&#039;t get screwed, but maybe a little faith is needed. Lots of talk on the forums about this so look around and make a judgement call&nbsp; :)

				I can vouch for BTC4CASH, excellent rates, prompt payments, and friendly anonymous service. Here is their review thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142418.0

				I researched this a few days ago, and decided on Bitstamp+Transferwise. <br /><br />Bitstamp (https://www.bitstamp.net/) is a pretty large EU-based bitcoin exchange (nearest EU equivalent of mtgox, AFAICT). They accept SEPA payments (EU-wide bank transfers). Banks often charge non-trivial fees on SEPA (~£9), which you can avoid if you want (at the cost of it taking a couple of days) by wiring the money with a service like Transferwise (https://transferwise.com), which will charge ~0.5%. The transfer&#039;s done in €, but Bitstamp accounts are denominated in USD (they convert for free on receipt).<br /><br />That&#039;s is the safe/legit route - much less chance of losing your money than with posting cash to a random SR vendor. Obviously it&#039;s not anonymous in the same way, but so what - I don&#039;t care to hide that I&#039;m buying BTC. (And BTC can always be anonymised by paying to SR via a coinmixing service).

				Thanks for the recommendations guys. I can help anyone in the UK. Have a search on the forums I&#039;ve got a couple of threads on here that people have posted in. Or drop me a PM on the main site :)<br /><br />
