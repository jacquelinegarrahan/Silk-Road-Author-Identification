				Hopefully the title/poll says it all.<br /><br />I&#039;m wanting to give a fantastic review to the Vendor who just delivered in terms of speed and stealth, but I&#039;m also wanting to check out the quality of the merchandise. I have no reason to doubt his stuff other than grim experience over my non-TOR so-called-&quot;Real&quot; life.<br /><br />Whaddyalldo?<br />

				It varies, as I often order for friends I&#039;m not always the one who uses it. But everytime when it&#039;s for me and not a harder psychedelic I&#039;m keeping for a special date I review after testing !

				I have done a lot of sample reviews for new vendors, and I realize that they are wanting to get feedback ASAP in most cases so I do my reviews in two parts. The first is packaging, shipping, communication and my initial impression from looking at the product, the second is of the product itself. Things that I can do during the week usually get reviewed within a few days, drugs I need to save for the weekend or an entire free day may take a few weeks to review.

				I finalize as soon as I get the goods, because the vendor probably wants his money. I ordered only weed so far and for that I can say a lot about the quality by looking at it and smelling it.<br />I will write more detailed reviews for everything i purchased as soon as Im done with the 50 newbie posts.

				Other. I like to finalize when order arrives and have taken a good look at it. Can&#039;t usually try until later.<br /><br />I&#039;ll give feedback on: delivery time, general level of stealth, how legit product looks, helpfulness of vendor etc.. Once the gear has been tried then go back and edit the feedback to say how it was.<br /><br />Figure if I ever get to posting a review here it will always been after I&#039;ve actually tried the item.

If you have quality issues you should take them up afterwards with the vendor. If you stick with the guys of good rep you will get a hearing. If in doubt try a small purchase first would be my advice.

I fully agree 100% you should not be doing that except in the strangest of circumstances (e.g. you live in a despotic regime and are making large international orders).<br /><br />This is about Finalizing Upon Arrival, which is slightly different.<br />

				You can finalize and still postpone your review. I would finalize upon arrival and then submit my review when I get around to trying it. Unless I plan on sampling within 1 or 2 days of receiving the product.

				Unless it gets here on the weekend i won&#039;t bother testing it first,just review stealth etc then edit review after i&#039;ve tried it for the quality.Don&#039;t see why the vendor should wait for me to have time to sample it as long as it&#039;s been delivered their part is done,so i have a quick look,wish it was the weekend and finalize in anticipation.
