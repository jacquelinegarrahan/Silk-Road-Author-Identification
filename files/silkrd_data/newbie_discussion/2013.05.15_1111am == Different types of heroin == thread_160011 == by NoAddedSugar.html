				Hello folks, can anyone clear something up for me, I understand the difference between #3 and #4, but is there a #1 and #2? And could someone compare Black Tar Heroin strength to #3 and #4. Based on 1g of each, which is generally stronger. Thank you for your time

				#1 and #2 you never need to worry about..that is for morphine base and unrefined heroin.....<br />#3 is usually for smoking, like chasing the dragon on foil and is a base and weaker than #4...it needs to be combined with acid to be iv&#039;d and can not be snorted...though some will claim they can snort...its not water soluble so you will not get high<br />tar and powder are both #4 that were created in different ways.....generally powder is more refined and therefore more pure and potent.....but tar has additional properties and can be smoked as is so there is a big following here on sr for it....and I have personally bought from almost every us vendor and the most potent stuff on the road is tar...and if you are a iv user....it has legs!!!! it last for a whole day and you wont wake up sick the next morning like you do with powder.....<br />anyways...pm if you need any help

				thanks Pacolipps, that was really helpful. I have been curious about trying out some H but I was always a bit confused on the differences between 3 &amp; 4 so that cleared it up.

				Yes, I second that. Very helpful. Hey mindfry, I wouldn&#039;t suggest anyone dabbling with heroin, I have been a user for years, only street #3&nbsp; besides one time I got some BTH. I&#039;ve been addicted twice and been in treatment for 4 years, firstly on Suboxone, secondly on Methadone. Everyone thinks they&#039;ll not develop a habit, but it&#039;s really nice, and more-ish. But if there&#039;s no stopping you, Have you thought about other opiates first? I started on Opium. Had a lot of Arabic and Persian friends and they love the stuff. I&#039;d have that before jumping in to the Heroin. Or have you already done the list of other Opiates? Remember to play safe mate, it can be dangerous, and it creeps up on you, the addiction. Mainly because it is so nice, and it&#039;s definitely not difficult to get hold of on here. I&#039;m not trying to mother you or tell you what to do mate, just be safe.

				I hear ya noaddedsugar. I&#039;ve always enjoyed the occasional opiate in pill form like Oxy. I never tried H and I dont see how it would be that much different. The main draw in ordering a stamp or two is the price compared to a couple pills. I&#039;m just thinking of the savings ;) I do like to consider myself safe and cautious enough to avoid forming any dependency, however, that sounds ridiculous when talking about heroin. <br /><br />My friend is giving me her next refill for OP oxy 60&#039;s ... I thought i might just either sell them or trade them for some other form of an opiate. I dont like the OP tamper proof formula. 60mg is way to much for my tolerance and It seems like it would be a lot of work trying to cut the pill into smaller dosages. Anyone have some experience with OP&#039;s?

				What&#039;s OP Mindfry? I would consider buying opium from here if I were you, you can get a gram for 0.24 BTC, and smoking or eating that is lovely. Smoking it is an art, having to drag a red hot bit of metal, like a metal coat hanger unwound across it and sucking the smoke through a tapered tube. It&#039;s more sociable than shooting up gear in a public toilet too. If I were you, I&#039;d start there mate. I&#039;m available for any questions you have on the subject. I&#039;ve never had an Oxy, I watched a documentary about US Oxycontin addicts, they were smoking it on the foil like chasing the old dragon with heroin. Just a whole pill, running down the foil. Amazing, didn&#039;t think that would work. I tried running Tramadol powder out of a capsule, that just burned the powder, burned the foil, and burned my throat!

				Oh sorry, I guess the new Oxycontin OP formula(replaced the OC formula)&nbsp; that the pharma company Purdue started producing is not common like it is in the US. It is tamper proof so people can no longer chew them, snort them or anything.&nbsp; America is definitely hooked on medical grade heroin like Oxycontin and opana. It&#039;s rare to hear about anyone touching heroin where I live, however, people pop painkillers like its baby aspirin. If you think smoking Oxy is crazy, I&#039;ve heard of people IV&#039;ing it too. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious about opium. I&#039;ve never seen it up on SR before. How is it any different than some pills or H? I do love the social part of drugs. That is one of the main reason I smoke weed, its fun to sit in a circle, load a couple bowls and have a conversation with friendly people. I also hate pills, I enjoy smoking or snorting substances. I however wont touch the needle.

				Well, opium is up there at the first stage in the process of making Morphine or Heroin. It&#039;s made from the poppies. I would definitely suggest having a smoke of that before heroin. Check out this dude&#039;s page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/c3ec82abd2<br /><br />You stick it on a bit of metal, put your other piece of metal in a gas flame or somewhere it can get red hot, have a tapered tube, like a cone in your mouth, thin end in between your lips, very wide open end above the Opium, and drag the red hot piece of metal over the Opium, inhale the smoke and keep it in your lungs for as long as possible. It makes a lot of smoke, you pass it around your mates. It&#039;s really nice, you can get a nod too, like with Heroin, and considering you&#039;ve not taken Heroin before, it would definitely be strong enough for you. I spent one xmas with some Muslim mates I had. We all worked at a pizza delivery shop, I was the only white guy there and I&#039;m not into xmas, so we closed the shop xmas day, drove to London and smoked Opium all day with my mates from Iran, Iraq and Egypt. It was awesome. I recommend it highly. It can make you vomit sometimes, but any strong Opiate can do. Any help?

				I gave opium a shot a few months ago. As soon as I got it I quickly learned that it&#039;s not so easy to use. I tried the hot knives method, but remember that morphine degrades under heat. I really didn&#039;t feel anything. The &#039;official&#039; method that was used in opium dens is to vaporize it with an actual opium pipe. I&#039;d love to try that but the only opium pipes I could find were hella expensive. Maybe someone else can clue me into a better way to do it, but I really didn&#039;t have any luck and it didn&#039;t seem worth the effort especially for someone already using other, stronger, opiates. It was more of a novelty &quot;oh boy I got to try opium!&quot; thing than an actual getting high as fuck thing.

				The way I just typed always worked for me. You have to gently warm the Opium up first, and you hold it with a safety pin or thin pointy metal, and only tickle it with the red hot coat hanger point. Maybe you had shit Opium. I&#039;ve never heard of it degrading due to the heat. Like I said, it&#039;s more sociable than Heroin. If you want a good time with mates, and you can afford it, all chip in like, it can be great. You can smoke it with the hubbly bubbly sheesha thing, I have no idea of it&#039;s real name. But doing it this way burns through the Opium incredibly fast. That&#039;s the rich man&#039;s way! Anyway, speak tomorrow folks, it&#039;s past my bedtime. Peace xx

				Thanks for the tip Sugar, looks like a good idea. The opium was from TheScurvyCrew on SR, I have no idea if it was good or not. If I ever get some again I&#039;ll definitely give that a shot.

				nothing wrong with tryin the heroin....just keep it in moderation and only snort it or smoke it......if you are new to it<br />no sense in developing a bad iv habit like me :-[<br />anyways....OP&#039;s do suck, but for me its because even the 80 are not strong enough and they cause serious stomach problems for me and many others because of the plastic they are made up of....and the old OC formula we used to crush up and snort and that was a nice high....back before i ever used to iv.....<br />but seriously....get you some powder and snort like a quarter bag or 0.025g to start off and keep it to only on the weekends or so...or get some tar and smoke it....and you will be able to manage just fine and have a nice high without the bad addiction side of things.....I did for 10 years......only thing that changed for me is I lost everything i owned including my house and a brand new car when the economy went downhill and I got bored at home and decided to shoot up one day.....now I have a worse habit...but I still manage it and keep it to a min and I go weeks at a time with nothing to keep myself from becoming a total junkie.....but im still no saint and take my advice with a grain of salt....I am merely telling you you can have a great time with heroin and you can use without becoming an addict and because of its potency...you can use a small amount and save a whole lot of money compared to expensive ass pills............ ;D

				I think you did not quite take my ost the right way....yes people lose everything they own from getting strung out....but I lost everything before I started doing dope ...I used to only take a few pills every now and then.....I lost everything when the economy started getting out of whack...the company i was working for canned me, so I went from making around $70- $100 K a year to not being able to find work and going broke with 4 kids and I had just put $30000 into a house I was buying and I had a brand new car that only needed 4 more payments and it was mine.....guess what I lost it all....and I was bored so I turned to dope out of plain boredom and I just am not the kind of person to sit around...dope helped me chill out so to say....but when I started to shoot it did become a habit

How were you smoking it?<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of Nod, because he&#039;s got great product, fast shipping, and is also polite and professional.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want large quantities, there&#039;s another vendor, whose name I&#039;ve forgotten, who resells Nod&#039;s product in smaller quantities.<br /><br />Also, Einstein777 has gunpowder that smokes really nicely.&nbsp; Overall, I think it&#039;s easier to get decent BTH on the road than a good #4 powder (although there are a couple of good powder vendors right now).<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of myth about heroin in US culture, in my opinion, and for that reason, I wish I could just encourage everyone to try it to counter the scare tactics and bullshit rhetoric of the anti-drug warriors.&nbsp; But instead, I can&#039;t resist telling you to please be careful. Heroin is somehow different from pills, and it&#039;s a lot cheaper.&nbsp; You can get strung out from sniffing or smoking it regularly, it just takes longer than when you IV it.&nbsp; And then, whether you embrace it, kick it, or try to moderate it, you&#039;re living with that monkey forever. Still, from a harm reduction perspective, if you&#039;re committed to experimenting with heroin, smoking is a good ROA, because it&#039;s very unlikely that you could OD that way, and it&#039;s not particularly hard on your body.<br /><br />Opium is awesome, and also something to be careful with.&nbsp; You can actually vaporize it off of tinfoil like heroin, you just have to be careful and patient, so that you don&#039;t get the flame too close.&nbsp; Or you can make yourself a lightbulb vaporizer. You can find instructions for doing that on Google, if I remember correctly.<br /><br />Good luck and be safe.

				bth dissolves in water no need for acid....it is number 4 just not as refined as powder.....just put it in the freezer and it gets super hard ....then smash it up to a powder<br />then dissolve in cold water and apply a little heat to it just until it begins to curdle up(you will know what I mean when you see it)<br />if you add too much heat or boil you will destroy part of the opiate in it...tar is much different than powder as it contains more alkaloids than regular #4 powder and it has legs ....like it last so much longer than powder and you will nod .....and I have been using powder for a couple years now...I live on the east coast and we get some pretty potent powder here...but the best dope I have ever had is the tar I have gotten off the road....<br />here is some good vendors to try out if you are interested<br />(by the way all tar can be smoked...just google it as there are specific methods to smoking it for best results)<br />Diamorphius I just recently tried out and he sent me some of the most potent tar i have ever had<br />supersun has the best dope i have ever had and he ships fast and communicates very well, he also has some potent coke if you are interested<br />einstein777 has some really good gunpowder (which is tar mixed with powder) and ships fast also<br />NOD has some excellent tar ships super fast every time, but it is very expensive<br />DO NOT TRUST NOD4LESS!! i seen someone mention him but not remember his name....he shorted me almost a third of my order (about a quarter gram on a 3/4 g order) and refused to do anything to make it right and even called me a scam artist even though I have almost 30 orders with over $3000 spent in the last couple months with no auto finalizes, no disputes, and no refunds or reships.......its been 3 weeks and he will not even reply to my messages now so YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED<br />anyways, I am trying to become more active here in the forums so feel free to PM me if you need any advice or just want to know where to get good dope or coke from ...or just post here or on one of my threads...I will help you out any way I can<br />I have tried almost every american dope vendor and I have tried out all of the top coke vendors <br />out of about 30 orders in the past 3 months I have been ripped off in some way or another 4 times so the road is actually safer than the streets....but if I can help a few of you from having to get ripped off even once than I feel like I have done something to help the silk road community<br />

				Black tar is #4, or heroin hydrochloride.&nbsp; Gunpowder is tar that has been cut with lactose from my understanding.<br /><br />Heroin #1 is essentialy opium<br />Heroin #2 is morphine base that has been precipitated from the opium.<br />Heroin #3 is heroin base.&nbsp; Non water soluble because it is a freebase, and not a salt.<br />Heroin #4 is Heroin hydrochloride or heroin acetate, or heroin citrate.&nbsp; It is water soluble.<br /><br />To inject heroin #3, heroin base, typically found in western europe you acidify it, or salt it.&nbsp; Fun fact: Salted heroin base becomes heroin hydrochloride in general terms.&nbsp; What you use as an acid changes the salt.&nbsp; You can think of it as bonding to the free heroin molecules.&nbsp; Don&#039;t add salt thinking you are acidifying your heroin.&nbsp; You&#039;re just making it useless to anyone but a desperate junkie.<br /><br />Morphine sulphate, like the pills we get in North America such as MS-contin is heroin#2 morphine base that has been salted.<br /><br />You can strip the salt from the morphine to turn it back to freebase morphine, and then acetylate it with Acetic Anhydride, or Acetic Acide (vinegar) under certain conditions.&nbsp; Ozzies call it homebake, and it will know you on your ass provided you can find your ass.<br /><br /><br />What you really need to know?&nbsp; Try to dissolve in water.&nbsp; If it won&#039;t dissolve add a bit of citric acid (best) or vinegar (better) or lemon juice (worst.)&nbsp; It will clear in the spoon, and you are good to go.

How were you smoking it?<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of Nod, because he&#039;s got great product, fast shipping, and is also polite and professional.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want large quantities, there&#039;s another vendor, whose name I&#039;ve forgotten, who resells Nod&#039;s product in smaller quantities.<br /><br />Also, Einstein777 has gunpowder that smokes really nicely.&nbsp; Overall, I think it&#039;s easier to get decent BTH on the road than a good #4 powder (although there are a couple of good powder vendors right now).<br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of myth about heroin in US culture, in my opinion, and for that reason, I wish I could just encourage everyone to try it to counter the scare tactics and bullshit rhetoric of the anti-drug warriors.&nbsp; But instead, I can&#039;t resist telling you to please be careful. Heroin is somehow different from pills, and it&#039;s a lot cheaper.&nbsp; You can get strung out from sniffing or smoking it regularly, it just takes longer than when you IV it.&nbsp; And then, whether you embrace it, kick it, or try to moderate it, you&#039;re living with that monkey forever. Still, from a harm reduction perspective, if you&#039;re committed to experimenting with heroin, smoking is a good ROA, because it&#039;s very unlikely that you could OD that way, and it&#039;s not particularly hard on your body.<br /><br />Opium is awesome, and also something to be careful with.&nbsp; You can actually vaporize it off of tinfoil like heroin, you just have to be careful and patient, so that you don&#039;t get the flame too close.&nbsp; Or you can make yourself a lightbulb vaporizer. You can find instructions for doing that on Google, if I remember correctly.<br /><br />Good luck and be safe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the advice. I have been using for 20 years but we don&#039;t get BTH in the uk. I tried it on the foil like you would with #3 but it did not run it just burnt nastly. Anyway I am always looking to try every type of h that I can get hold of so if any one has bought Tar and can tell me how to smoke ot properly then please do.<br />I have no veins left so pinning is out of the queston.

I heard you can smoke tar so I bought some. now I don&#039;t believe you need to google how to smoke somthin. It&#039;s not rocket science. Only it did not smoke that well. If i had thought there would be a problem I would have asked on here or used google as you say but I am not on line where i use so there you have it. I got the stuff, was no way on earth I was going to find a pc go on line and google it. I just wanted to smoke there and then. I think that tar was crap coz it burnt and fizzled but and did not smoke well.<br /><br />Maybe next time i will goole while ordering. Maybe

				by the way dont let vendors push you around...both of these transactions i speak of the vendors told me they were putting me on a vendor &quot;blacklist&quot;...they can only prevent you from purchasing from them and they can message other buyers...but if they get caught, they are violating their account..they are not permitted to blackmail you or try to get other sellers to cut you off....vendors base their opinions off of your buyer stats and most vendors are really good people that are here to make a living and I have had many more good experiences than bad ....I have only had problems with these 2 vendors out of the last 30 transactions and I have more risk of a bad deal on the streets locally than that...so just be sure to read reviews and if you see a seller post about a buyer on his page...think twice about ordering from him, because that means he refused to resolve a problem that he more than likely created....there are only a few people who are going to go through all the trouble of buying drugs just to try and scam a seller.....think about that

				well i dont know the entire story, just what you are telling us so i&#039;m not going to comment in depth. usually 2 sides to every story. that being said just because a vendor uses his product doesn&#039;t mean that its good. a buyer has the right to his opinion. if 100 people liked a sellers gear and it did nothing when i took it at my regular dose i would post that in the feedback. when most people are buying goods i think they look at the information as a whole and if the sellers product is good i don&#039;t think one guy saying he didn&#039;t like it is going to change people from buying. i agree with you, don&#039;t let anyone push you around. if people become censored then the feedback is useless and the entire foundation crumbles.

First of all, I don&#039;t appreciate you calling me an asshole - and especially going all over reddit - which you KNOW I cannot go on and post defending myself - so your cowardly actions are unappreciated.<br /><br />I would LOVE for you to post the messages from our conversation.&nbsp; Your story changed at least twice on two different points - first off, the bag was 50mg short - then you say that you weighed it with the bag (WHICH AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WEIGHS 350mg (+/- 10mg) - it&#039;s a 2&quot;x2&quot; baggie with little black pirates on it - I use the same bag everytime - look that up) it was 50mg short with the bag.&nbsp; You said you didn&#039;t weigh or didn&#039;t have a scale and then you had your friends scale.&nbsp; Second of all, if it were 400mg short on a 750mg order, why in the WORLD would you EVER finalize the transaction and leave 5/5 feedback, at first.&nbsp; I will NOT ACCEPT your story that it was 200mg-250mg short - it&#039;s impossible based on the weight of the bag.&nbsp; I don&#039;t keep ANY OTHER bags around - so it&#039;s impossible to be 250mg short - it was 400mg or 0mg - take your pick.&nbsp; I have sent 250mg to someone for FREE because I was 30mg short - because HE WAS HONEST.<br /><br />YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS EVER SAID THAT I&#039;VE BEEN ANYTHING BUT THE VERY BEST - IN EVERY ASPECT OF WHAT IS EXPECTED AS A VENDOR.<br /><br />I am 100% honest - and I want to believe you are too - the only thing that makes any sense is what someone else posted in another thread you started to trash my reputation - was that English may not be your primary language.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will not succumb to ANY perceived attempt at scamming me, and at this point, I perceive this as an attempt to extort from me and I REFUSE to accept that.<br /><br />On top of that - I offered you Free Shipping (because it 50mg short, as it read in your message) and then I offered to SPLIT the difference at 200mg (which is basically what you said it was short yourself) - but your pride cost you, because you were more offended at my offer (Cash &amp; never order again) that you refused to accept that.&nbsp; BOTH TIMES, I SAID, IF THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE AN ACCEPTABLE RESOLUTION - but you never gave me one.&nbsp; <br /><br />AND THEN AS SOON AS YOU SAW I WASN&#039;T GIVING INTO YOUR DEMANDS - THEN 200mg IS OK.&nbsp; That&#039;s when I decided I was sending you nothing.&nbsp; It was, as if, you were trying to push and see how much you could get and when the line was drawn, you wanted what you could.<br /><br />PLEASE POST THE MESSAGES!&nbsp; It will confirm everything I&#039;ve just said.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to post anything, because I have nothing to prove.<br /><br />On top of that, when you get your 50 posts and get to play with the big boys, come try this stunt over there - I&#039;ve served EVERY person who frequents that post.&nbsp; They know what I&#039;m about - they know I&#039;m here to help and help others not get screwed - why would I screw you?&nbsp; It&#039;s really not worth it.&nbsp; I lose sales and my # goes down and I have to waste time in my life responding to this rubbish.&nbsp; YOU REALLY THINK I&#039;M GOING TO SCAM YOU FOR $75???&nbsp; <br /><br />Fucking rediculous. If you decide to respond, only do it with the messages.&nbsp; Let others deem for themselves the true nature of this argument.&nbsp; I should&#039;ve listened to grandpa when he said, never argue with fools - because people from a distance can tell who is who.

				Always good to see vendors on the forums. Someone else mentioned you, N4L, in another thread. This is really unhelpful because I can&#039;t find it, I will continue to look and update this post when I do, but in the post I&#039;m referring to, they said to avoid you.

				I am a nooby here and N4L gave me a&nbsp; lot of his time helping me to familiarize myself with the whole business of getting bitcoins, issues with SR and other advice.&nbsp; But mainly I valued his interest and support as I explored this amazing world of SR which is, at the same time, somewhat confusing technically.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I&#039;ve seen him do this with many others; in short, he is a helpful presence on SR.&nbsp; At best, there was some misunderstanding between PacoLipps and Nod4Less, the nature of which is not clear enough to me to judge.&nbsp; Perhaps N4L felt he was being set up and that wasn&#039;t in fact Paco&#039;s intent, or Paco did intend to blackmail him.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there is plenty of misunderstanding and probably some on both sides.&nbsp; But what is clear to me from so much else obvious evidence is that N4L is a good guy and a considerable asset to SR and to the forums (and for nooby&#039;s also) and a vendor who always sells the best products with the best stelth, though at a cost above others.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with that; it&#039;s a legitimate market niche.&nbsp; &nbsp;He&#039;s one of the &#039;good guys&#039; and I think finding a fight with him is totally counterproductive.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a misunderstanding.&nbsp; They happen.&nbsp; Let&#039;s leave it at that.&nbsp;

First of all, I don&#039;t appreciate you calling me an asshole - and especially going all over reddit - which you KNOW I cannot go on and post defending myself - so your cowardly actions are unappreciated.<br /><br />I would LOVE for you to post the messages from our conversation.&nbsp; Your story changed at least twice on two different points - first off, the bag was 50mg short - then you say that you weighed it with the bag (WHICH AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WEIGHS 350mg (+/- 10mg) - it&#039;s a 2&quot;x2&quot; baggie with little black pirates on it - I use the same bag everytime - look that up) it was 50mg short with the bag.&nbsp; You said you didn&#039;t weigh or didn&#039;t have a scale and then you had your friends scale.&nbsp; Second of all, if it were 400mg short on a 750mg order, why in the WORLD would you EVER finalize the transaction and leave 5/5 feedback, at first.&nbsp; I will NOT ACCEPT your story that it was 200mg-250mg short - it&#039;s impossible based on the weight of the bag.&nbsp; I don&#039;t keep ANY OTHER bags around - so it&#039;s impossible to be 250mg short - it was 400mg or 0mg - take your pick.&nbsp; I have sent 250mg to someone for FREE because I was 30mg short - because HE WAS HONEST.<br /><br />YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS EVER SAID THAT I&#039;VE BEEN ANYTHING BUT THE VERY BEST - IN EVERY ASPECT OF WHAT IS EXPECTED AS A VENDOR.<br /><br />I am 100% honest - and I want to believe you are too - the only thing that makes any sense is what someone else posted in another thread you started to trash my reputation - was that English may not be your primary language.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will not succumb to ANY perceived attempt at scamming me, and at this point, I perceive this as an attempt to extort from me and I REFUSE to accept that.<br /><br />On top of that - I offered you Free Shipping (because it 50mg short, as it read in your message) and then I offered to SPLIT the difference at 200mg (which is basically what you said it was short yourself) - but your pride cost you, because you were more offended at my offer (Cash &amp; never order again) that you refused to accept that.&nbsp; BOTH TIMES, I SAID, IF THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE AN ACCEPTABLE RESOLUTION - but you never gave me one.&nbsp; <br /><br />AND THEN AS SOON AS YOU SAW I WASN&#039;T GIVING INTO YOUR DEMANDS - THEN 200mg IS OK.&nbsp; That&#039;s when I decided I was sending you nothing.&nbsp; It was, as if, you were trying to push and see how much you could get and when the line was drawn, you wanted what you could.<br /><br />PLEASE POST THE MESSAGES!&nbsp; It will confirm everything I&#039;ve just said.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to post anything, because I have nothing to prove.<br /><br />On top of that, when you get your 50 posts and get to play with the big boys, come try this stunt over there - I&#039;ve served EVERY person who frequents that post.&nbsp; They know what I&#039;m about - they know I&#039;m here to help and help others not get screwed - why would I screw you?&nbsp; It&#039;s really not worth it.&nbsp; I lose sales and my # goes down and I have to waste time in my life responding to this rubbish.&nbsp;

				Wow, havent logged in for a while. Kind of got hostile in here&nbsp; ???<br /><br />anyways, just wanted to thank Paco and Sugar for the advice they gave me a couple days ago (I was about to purchase my first taste of H). I was window shopping for a couple of weeks since i decided I wanted to make the economical switch from Oxy to H. I wanted to make the switch for the crazy amount of money i would save myself. I couldnt stand spending all my money on a couple pills when I know it would go so much farther with H. However, you guys helped me realize that I was lying to myself. I could only afford to mildly support my habit. I&#039;m glad i didnt make the switch. I used to always tell myself I didnt have an addictive personality but i was wrong. Opiates are deceiving, so warm and friendly. Hidden under the pure bliss i feel, there is always an unsatisfied urge. It was quiet voice telling me that a little bit more would be nice. The voice slowly grew stronger till it would shout, I want more, hell, I Need more. The other day I was sending out my usual mass texts asking if anyone had oxy, I pulled out my wallet and started to count my money to make sure I had enough. I had $150 to last me 5 days until my paycheck came. I&#039;m siting on my floor, stressed out, sorting my cash for the week, 10 for gas, 20 for food, and 120 for oxy. Leaving me with nothing to pay bills with yet again. I&#039;ve been fighting it for so long, but i finally had to admit that I didnt have control over my drug use. I decided to only spend 40$ on oxy and taper myself off. I swore to myself I will not touch anymore until I have my life sorted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m not sure why I felt inclined to post this here but oh well.

				hey nod4less...since you are here defending yourself...which I am glad to see...I only asked for you to send me a couple points to make up for it and my story never changed...I just should have been more clear as you did not understand that I was weighing with the bag from the first message, which i cleared up to you after you took a week to respond the first time...then you took 3 days to respond again and told me you did not want to send another package as it was a &quot;risk&quot;<br />now I am okay with it, I have accepted that you are never going to make this right, and I gave you the feedback you deserve, not only for shorting me on my order, but for the way you treated me and made me out to be a scam artist....but its funny that I have been on silk road for over 3 months and had 30 orders with no other major problems and by the way everyone...the other problem I had with diesel therapy has been taken care of also...he has sent me 4 bags of his new stuff to make up for it and has been very nice about it....so I will be updating my posts and reviews to reflect this....so as of now...I have had 30 orders with almost $4000 spent and the only U.S. heroin dealer who has done me wrong is Nod4Less <br />you can say what you want about me and you can cut me off and blacklist me....but there are a whole lot of vendors that I have a good business relationship with and I can get better dope for less money and I will get the weight I pay for, so after the way you have treated me, WHY WOULD I BUY FROM YOU AGAIN?<br />I am here in the forums merely spreading my experience with you and people can make their own decisions....but I am not going to let you sit here and tell everyone that I have done something wrong ....I even paid you as soon as I received my package knowing that is was under weight and I was so nice to you about it...you turned it into something ugly....but I was honest with you and I did tell you from the beginning that it weighed 0.7 gram and I did not communicate that clear enough in the first message so I clarified it in the second and my story never changed at all<br />seriously, all you had to do was send me what you shorted me and I would have praised you and I would have been very happy with it<br />but you offered me free shipping and when i turned it down you offered me a partial refund with a stipulation that I would be cut off from ordering from you and that was not very nice at all...and then you told me I was lying basically and said there is no way you messed up .....so I left you the feedback you deserve and I have posted my experience to protect others from having a bad experience and that is what these forums are for to post our experiences and knowledge<br />I always give second chances....and I believe everyone is entitled to making mistakes and I know I am far from perfect also...I have been more than willing to give you a chance to make this right and earn your feedback......but I am not just going to sit back and let you rip me off then make me out to be a scammer....I have never been dishonest and I have never done anything to deserve your actions or words<br /><br />

				My mate decided the best heroin he ever had was the one administered when he pushed a button in his hospital bed 2 years ago. 30 years old, and was gone about 3 months later, not from the diamorphine, but a rare PET cancer. It certainly made me think things a little differently since. Enjoy it all guys for now!

I just sniff and I&#039;m feeling pretty dam fine from his product. He sent extra on top of my original order as well. Seems deez is a pretty good vendor with good product.I&#039;ll repeat.

In the spoon (a regular tablespoon) the powder was probably the size of a thumbnail flattened out. I&#039;ll try and get a better estimate with next shot.<br /><br />Tolerance level wise, this was my first opiate IV in almost four months. I was doing Dilaudid 4 mg IV several times a day (the actual solution, not pills). Since, I&#039;ve been doing Vicodin fairly regularly. There&#039;s a plateau with Vicodin with me (50 mg feels the same to me as 100 mg) so it&#039;s hard to judge. Definitely not the kind of tolerance I used to have though. It felt like my first shot of Dilaudid 4 mg in the morning though, a little stronger on the end though.<br /><br />Sorry, I know that&#039;s hard to decipher for tolerance.

				N4L apparently, not if you take pacolips&#039; opinion. Or was the quality never mentioned? I forget. I&#039;d love to give the tar a go IV. Also like to try #4 soon. I&#039;ve been getting great #3 from c63amg (Holland) excellent stealth and quality.

Almost white it was.&nbsp; I never knew it was #4 and we were smoking #3.<br /><br />I read in one of these threads that you can cook up #3 for a hit and put it in a nasal spray and spray it up your hooter. Makes sense. You should be able to do that with #4. It should not hurt like when snorting a powder. I used to mix ketamin and coke with water and put that in a nasal spray. That worked really well. You can do it with fentanyl so why not #3 and # 4. I for one will be trying this soon so i will let you all know if its good or a total waste of time. I have no veins left so i am always up for other methods of getting gear into my system. Last month i had to have a blood test and two nurses gave up after stabbing me a number of times and made me a hospital appointment where they will use ultra sound to locate a vein.&nbsp; I could do with one of these ultra sound gadgets at home.

				I&#039;ve had them try the ultrasound with me. Watching them with the high def ultrasound was amazing. They still couldn&#039;t locate a vein though. They have to go into my neck to get a line in me or take blood.
