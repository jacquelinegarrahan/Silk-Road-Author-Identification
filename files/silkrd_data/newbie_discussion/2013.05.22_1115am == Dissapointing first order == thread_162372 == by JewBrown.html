				<br />So today my first order arrived, 1.1g outdoor haze from MrCronk. Stealth was good, weight was good. But whilst I was expecting some nice green smelly buds crystal covered like in the picture on the listing, what i&#039;ve received is mainly brown with green/grey, and smells quite earthy. <br /><br />I had to finalise early as does everyone with MrCronk, I don&#039;t know if this is just mugging me off because it was my first order?<br />cheers <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:(

				&nbsp;Every so often you will get burnt on here, either scammed or sub-par quality like in your case.&nbsp; You just need to weed the good from the bad. Unlucky your first transaction wasn&#039;t satisfactory though.

				Try to talk with the vendor to see if s/he is willing to do something about it (it can also be a mistake, sometimes it happens). If that&#039;s not the case and the vendor won&#039;t do anything about it update your feedback and write what happened so that other users can know.<br /><br />Sadly you did FE and this give you no opportunity to resolve the issue with the admins.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to hear about your trouble but I can guarantee you that it&#039;s not always so and one the contrary the most of the times the product you get is exactly what advertised. Next time however it&#039;s better if you don&#039;t FE if you can avoid it because, as you see now, with FE you are out of every possibility of having a refund/reship if something as this happens if it&#039;s not coming directly from the vendor itself (and it can happen also this naturally, depending on who the vendor is).

				thanks for your replies,<br />I won&#039;t be FE&#039;ing again for a start haha. I&#039;ll give him a day or so to reply and if he doesn&#039;t want to sort it out i&#039;ll have to change my feedback... The likeliness of him now sending me the right bud is unlikely...

I gather that he has been making some changes to his business lately, so orders have been a bit rushed maybe.<br />I had some Thai weed recently, and it wasn&#039;t great BUT, I will definitely be using him again without question because his service is flawless like 99% of the time.<br /><br />Send him a message and explain your issue, he&#039;s a very personable chap and will no doubt address your concerns.

				Are you sure it&#039;s not just a different batch from the picture? If it smoked fine I&#039;d be honestly inclined to not care but then I don&#039;t know all about weed strains and differences.

				Depending on the size of the vendor&#039;s business, you might have to wait a while for a reply. Never FE!! Use lotteries or buy porn to get your stats up if some vendors require a minimun or 3/5 etc orders without you having to FE. You only have protection if you stay in Escrow, that&#039;s what it&#039;s there for. Have you read the wiki and the buyer&#039;s guide? Also, always keep up to date with the latest scams by visiting these forums, they&#039;re invaluable. Good luck

				I don&#039;t think it could be that it is a different batch to be honest. This stuff isn&#039;t even green, and if you&#039;ve seen the picture on his listing, it&#039;s meant to be some dank buds. I haven&#039;t smoked any yet and I guess that could change my mind, but I&#039;ve not got high hopes<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/cf4e81a979<br />

				Granted the &quot;highgrade&quot; tag he advertises it with is a bit wide of the mark but you&#039;ve bought an outdoor strain mate. Of course it&#039;s going to be a bit earthy, a bit brownish and probably won&#039;t taste as nice as the stuff your used to. That&#039;s the nature of outdoor strains.<br /><br />Admittedly it does look better on the picture but doesn&#039;t half the stuff in the supermarket?<br /><br />If you want some bud along the lines of what you&#039;d buy off a local dealer you&#039;ll have to go for one of his outdoor strains. Hence the price difference. His outdoor and Thai strains are pretty poor in comparison.<br /><br />If you also look closely at his t&amp;c&#039;s I think I&#039;m correct in saying that FE is not compulsory as long as you finalise ASAP following delivery.

				Ive ordered from MrCronk many times and its always been fine, the buds maybe not as high a quality as he says though. Ive heard of people receiving both his thai and haze and there&#039;s been no difference in the two. I&#039;m sure if you drop him a message he may be willing to sort something out!

				That 10g weed trim looks quite good, especially as money is always an issue... 10gs for 0.34 bitcoins

				Dunno if weed trim is what you need. <br />The durban he has is quite nice, it gives you a nice high and it tastes pretty good. If you long for cheap weed and have time, try La Fuente. It might take up to two month, so don&#039;t scam that poor guy like prolly 20-30% of his customers do. <br />If it arrives you will be happy because you got weed for 1-2€/g
