				That&#039;s perfectly fine if you&#039;re buying personal amounts of anything. If you&#039;re looking to buy in drug dealer quantities I would use a different method. Just go ahead and send to your SR wallet. SR has a tumbler built in so it goes through a number of wallets before it actually hits yours.

				you can yeah. if you&#039;re not paranoid and are only planning on buying personal amounts then it wouldn&#039;t be any problem. the feds aren&#039;t going to go to the trouble of tracing btc for a personal use bust. however if you are paranoid you should know that there&#039;s nearly always a charge when transferring btc between wallets, even if its only small there&#039;s still always a charge. you have to factor those charges into the cost of your durgs.

				Well it all depends. Is it going to a big city or small town? Is there a known drug problem in your area with the drugs you are sending? Are the drugs crossing the border? What type of drug? A lot comes into play when deciding to order large quantities or multiple small quantities. There are many factors that arise when deciding to deposit money into your account. 2k worth of LSD IS NOT the same as 2k worth of cocaine. My advice is, if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing or are unsure, don&#039;t do it.

I wouldn&#039;t be spending anything over 1k on any one purchase anyway I know how to use SR was just wondering how paranoid I should be when buying/transferring bitcoins
