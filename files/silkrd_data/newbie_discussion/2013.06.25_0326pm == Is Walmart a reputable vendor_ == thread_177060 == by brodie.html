				Other than unethical wage class action alwsuits, their reputation is exceedingly getting better.<br /><br />And as someone else mentioned, they&#039;re rolling them prices back like my low-rider thru the hood.

				I saw the same thing..dropped a bunch of listings today, and the prices aren&#039;t too shabby. I was looking for some insight as well. Nothing sold this month and review thread by Walmart was started October 04, 2012.

				I have talked to Walmart and he has agreed to send me a sample of some product. So if all goes well you can expect a review of him coming from me :)

He had no problem quickly finalizing my losing attempts but is just letting my winner sit there processing. I chaqlked it up to being the weekend but it says he ships on Mondays and he didn&#039;t process it yesterday or make any attempt to reply to me so I am starting to wonder wtf is going on.
