				I&#039;m really confused atm i ordered 0,5g h#4 that&#039;s been shipped last friday and today theres a letter or rather a plastic bag with a card inside from post.nl with the following message:<br />&quot;het spijt ons u te moeten melden dat uw postzending incomleet en/of beschadigd is. Deze schade is waarschijnlijk onstaan tijdens de postverwerking. Wij bieden onze excuses aan voor het ongemak.&quot;<br />plus the front side of what was probably the letter (it&#039;s been cut out). Well I guess it says my shipment was incomplete or damaged. <br />What is now gonna happen? Do I have to except any other letters and from who and am I gonna get a punishment for it or what is now gonna happen? <br />And can I request a refund/reship for this from the vendor? If yes I guess it&#039;s not advisable to use the same address again right?<br />

				twelvemonkeys, you do not seem to have very much info to go by here. The Dutch translates to;<br /><br />&quot;sorry to have to inform you that your item shipment incomleet and / or damaged. This damage is probably founded during the mail. We apologize for any inconvenience&quot;<br /><br />I would take this as notification that the shipment has been seized by the authorities. The notification has not been issued by customs or the relevant authority in the destination country but most likely the transport provider - I would assume this will be addressed to the person who was supposed to receive the package in the first place. Depending how this narcotic is scheduled in your country and any thresholds relating to weight/quantity you might be lucky and receive a warning, you may have to go to court. <br /><br />In Australia importing Heroin which is Schedule 1, even at 0.5g I would expect criminal charges be pursued - if it was clear cut who the responsible party was, no significant resources would be allocated to &quot;setting up&quot; the receiver to take delivery or any other operations relating to acquiring sufficient evidence to prosecute. If this was sent to a fake name, drop/temporary address and customs made no effort to identify the true receiver, I think you would likely walk in this instance. Definitely seek advice locally, you cannot expect the legal systems and penalties to match globally.

				Judging by the moonspeak you posted, you&#039;re Dutch. Does the Netherlands really give a shit that you&#039;re purchasing a small amount of drugs for personal use? Judging by the fact that they gave you a note apologizing for the fact that they lost your heroin I would say not.

Why would customs give notification of damaged cargo? The goods have been seized but the notice the OP detailed is from the transport company.Anyway, decide for yourself I guess but I am sticking with my theory haha

				My thoughts with situations such as these is that if they were intent on doing something more serious, they wouldn&#039;t let you know in advance with something less serious. Keep it low key for awhile and I&#039;d say you are straight.

				dabdiego, I think you are confusing the actions of the transport company with those of customs. They act independently of one another, if customs seized his heroin, the transport provider may have no idea - they could have just received an empty or opened satchel (as customs had already recorded the details and seized his heroin). It&#039;s very hard to say what further actions will come of this because I am not native to the Netherlands.<br /><br />Toska, I used the OP&#039;s dutch with google translate to get that translation. From my experience these web translations often have minor errors and there is also a possibility that the OP may have made a minor type-o in his post - so I would not be suspicious of this. There is always the chance his heroin was stolen before it reached the local transport company, then admansta&#039;s dialog might be accurate. In Dutch that would translate to - &quot;WOOOOOW Ik heb net de jackpot! Betere dekking van deze door het versturen van een kort bericht, laat dan krijg HOOG&quot; I think it sounds better that way, haha
