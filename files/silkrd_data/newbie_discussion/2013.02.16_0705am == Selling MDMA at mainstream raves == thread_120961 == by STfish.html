			<dd class="postbody">
				So, due to financial difficulties, i&#039;ve decided to start selling PURE MDMA (83.5%) at raves.. I&#039;m just looking for tips on how to get rid of my product as fast as I can. The events are typically going to have over 500 people and i&#039;m going to have around 50 caps ranging from 135-145 mg in each cap, selling each for 20 dollars. Could you guys give me tips on sneaking it in, and finding a clientele to sell the product to as fast as possible? My plan is to just get in and get out as soon as the caps are gone, i&#039;ve decided it would be best if I was sober for the process. My plan is also to have a friend scout around and look for people wanting to buy, once they decide to do it, they&#039;ll give him the money and then he will tell them to come to me, i&#039;ll have the product on me and I will give it to them accordingly. Any advice, or tips would be more then welcome! Don&#039;t be afraid to be mean and say my plan is stupid, it&#039;s my first time doing it and I need advice whether it&#039;s harsh or not!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />STfish

				I would make sure you have a drink with you and drinking it slowly so you don&#039;t stick out, and if your friend is willing to go and get money for you, you could give him a better cut and have him hold say 5 at a time and when he runs out he can come find you and grab some more.<br /><br />If your friend got caught with anything it would be a lot less than you, and they would have no reason to search you at that point.

				Definitely makes sense to have one person holding the goods, and one person selling then a few at a time. If that person gets caught they should have no more than a few items and very little cash on them. In some cases the runner, even if they got caught could talk their way out of it, either on the scene or in court, whereas holding 15+ grams and a thousand dollars in your pockets is a guaranteed conviction. <br />Just make sure you don&#039;t look too suspicious getting more doses every minute from your mule!<br />That&#039;s how I would look at it anyway...<br />Good luck, hope your financial situation improves soon!

As far as the smoking area goes, i&#039;ll probably move out there towards the middle of the night because it will probably be where the sober people who couldn&#039;t find molly will be at, I know there will be TONS of people looking, and the events are all 18+ so i&#039;m not worried about selling to a minor and them taking like 5 caps at once and flipping shit. Most of the people taking the caps know what they are doing and have done it before.

				Alright guys so rave #1 was pretty much a success! The only problem I ran into was idiots abusing and blaming me when they were rolling to hard, I told them the product was pure, shit I even told them there was .2 in each cap just to stop them from doing to much but nope, that wasn&#039;t enough the kid took 2 at one time, and he claimed that I gave him 2ci, which I know isn&#039;t true due to me using the product myself and various tests to prove that this was in fact the cream of the crop! So any tips for that, i&#039;m thinking about going down to only .1 in each cap just to prevent this from happening in the future, I really don&#039;t want to do this but people are just stupid these days and I can&#039;t trust them, I understand that I have huge liabilities, but there&#039;s only so much I can do to prevent this from happening, i&#039;d still be selling the caps for 20 and i&#039;m almost positive whoever takes one will have a great roll, just not as long/hard (more like the shit around here that&#039;s cut with other stuff) I really didn&#039;t want to stoop down to this scumbag dealer status but I really don&#039;t see any other options.

				Yeah, I was going to suggest that you can probably get away with caps of .1. Then you could also charge less and sell more. At festivals and big enough shows people just walk around the lawn saying &#039;molly&#039;/&#039;rolls&#039;/&#039;doses&#039;/drug for sale under their breaths and don&#039;t stop moving; a person who is interested will follow or stop them. These types of places are drug paradises though, and the size and amount of bodies present are big protection factors, so it may not be as safe a method at city raves.<br /><br />The few times I&#039;ve had enough MDMA or LSD on my person to sell (with no desire to go out of my way to), I&#039;ve been on the product myself, feeling the love and, for better or worse, giving a lot of it away for free.

				In my country I would advise getting the know/getting the blessing of/giving a cut to the security/bouncers - they usually control what dealing is allowed in the venue. <br /><br />If you&#039;re discovered without their blessing then you might be in for a beating/confiscation of merchandise/etc.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;re selling good gear and doing the right thing, I wish you well...

				I do this all the time. Easily make 4-5 grand profit a night.<br />I am close friends with all of the security at the 4-5 clubs I regular. They make sure I don&#039;t get caught and if something happens with someone else were the security confiscates drugs, they sell them to me cheap.<br />Money money money

				The best way to do it is obviously have someone else do it for you.<br />I usually point our my caps to ~.08 and sell em for 15 a piece with the option to buy 2 for 25.<br />This can be problematic due to kids with stupid amounts of bills and the transaction is obvious as fuck.<br />I can usually get like 320 x 15 = 4800<br />Normally .1 per cap which results in roughly 280 x 15 = 4200<br />Making a little extra cash never hurts.<br />I really wouldn&#039;t put .2 per cap, that&#039;s just overkill.<br />.08 to .1 is enough, most people end up poppin 3 or 4.. <br />Then they roll too hard and act a foo.<br /><br />

				Yeah, the thing is, if some dude comes up and tells you his pills are twice as strong as everyone else&#039;s, you kind of assume it&#039;s just a sales pitch. So best to go with the standard dosage.<br /><br />Quite amusing that you got complaints that they are too strong though!

I&#039;m looking forward to making alot of people happy and making a lot of money at the same time!&nbsp; ;D

				You&#039;ll get busted selling to randoms at these events. I know someone who got popped selling to two paid snitches that were cute little rave girls in their underwear. Don&#039;t trust anyone, especially druggies. They get popped with a pill or two, then the cops use them to pop the dealers in exchange for not getting arrested.

				This should be more a thread about techniques about how to do a better job at this<br />rather than whether or not you should.<br /><br />Is the best product to sell just a simple mix of SR MDMA and SR speed in a empty gel cap you<br />can buy at your local drug store.<br /><br />How do you gain trust in all the people it requires to conduct your business safely?<br />Do you also know the manager/owner? Do you HAVE to know the security guards?<br />Are there ways to pick out certain clubs where it may be easier to do business?<br />Is the DJ important from a dealers standpoint? Also is the aforementioned two-person method the most effective.<br /><br />i dont consider myself a raver but i like the music i love the drugs and id like to start going to shows especially if theres evidence of people making a couple grand each night

As far as security goes i&#039;m pretty much not concerned at all, if i&#039;m not using the mule method and i&#039;m out in the crowd selling, getting away will be a breeze, also if it comes down to it, ditching the product will also be extremely easy. Securities main concern at the venues I go to is mostly kicking the people out that are too fucked up and giving their venue a bad look. Security at the venues I go to KNOW that almost EVERYONE is rolling or on some type of drug. There is no police officers inside the venue, just security, whether or not there is undercover agents I have no idea, but in all the raves i&#039;ve been to i&#039;ve never seen anyone getting arrested for selling any type of drug. The way I see it, the police aren&#039;t willing to risk the lives of others at such a large venue just to bust a small time MDMA dealer. The police understand that if someone can sneak drugs into a venue with no hassle they can easily sneak weapons that can in some cases be lethal and they aren&#039;t willing to risk the security of the other people at the venue. I&#039;ve never worked in a security or law enforcement agency so my whole logic could be complete bullshit (please correct me if you have more information). But thanks to everyone that&#039;s contributed to this thread! I love seeing that there is a bunch of smart people on the roads whether they be users, vendors, or all of the above.&nbsp; ;)

				Selling them individually is risky.. if you can find someone who buy large quantity maybe just cut the price down from 20 &amp; sell to a select few dealers.. Then they take the risk selling the caps individually instead of you &amp; its easier to keep tabs on a handful of people. If they get busted just disappear from them and lay low lol

				I think it&#039;s appropriate to mention the risk involved.&nbsp; I mean, even if the risk of jail is only 1% how the fuck is it worth it?<br /><br />How do you do it safely?&nbsp; Only sell to friends you can trust.&nbsp; You cannot safely sell to strangers at a rave.

				Always make sure you know what kind of security you will be facing at points where they funnel crowds into the venue. At one festival I went to I saw a girl in front of me get busted because they took her camera bag, opened up one of the zipper compartments, and pulled out a sheet of acid. This was just on a standard search that everyone had to go through to get in and a lot of people were caught off guard by how thorough they were being. <br /><br />Also, as pretty much everyone has stated, there is definitely a big risk of undercovers/CI&#039;s being present and working the crowd just like you are doing so be careful (obviously).

				To me the risk would be much to high. <br />Maybe just some suggestions:<br /><br />Don&#039;t try to sell at a venue you don&#039;t know - the risk is not only about cops, it&#039;s about the drug policy of the venue and about other pushers too.<br />If you know some people at the rave who want some stuff, they will also know others who want some - try to get connect indirectly.<br />To me the safest without further complications is to put into your socks - or even better store it at a place which is secure and just take some caps with you.<br />Hope this makes sense to you!<br /><br />Othello
