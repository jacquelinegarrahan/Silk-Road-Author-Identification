				As someone who is prescribed Adderall, the prices on here blew my mind. $10-$15 per pill?!<br /><br />Obviously I am overlooking something... any helpful information out there?<br />I looked for generic amphetamines and even those were expensive in pill form.

				I am wondering the same thing, I never know people like them so much.<br />I use to know somebody who had a few hundred of them sitting around because he never took them really strong ones too.<br />If I would of known, I would of bought all of them off him for a cheap and flipped them on here, sadly that was years ago.<br /><br />I also thought it was easy to get these from the doctor, so why so a high demand?

				they are the highest sought after stimulant script, and also the least prescribed script as of recent. (they have been coming up with many new ones like vyvance etc..)<br />Sure there&#039;s a premium.. but it really isnt just that seeing as you can usually find reasonable prices in bulk.&nbsp; unless you can find it cheaper locally your better off sticking to the road. <br />But personally I&#039;d just go get a script of adderall my self if you wanted them that bad.. and if you where looking for bulk i&#039;d suggest finding a reasonable goal and talking to a few vendors..<br /><br />best of luck!

				Not to worry, your buddy the friendly injun is in the process of breaking into the market with some dexedrine; no need for these mixed amphetamine salts!<br /><br /><br />My supplies aren&#039;t particularly robust, but...well, I&#039;ve other ways of handling that.
