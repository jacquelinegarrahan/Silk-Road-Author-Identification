				After a long couple of weeks of recruiting, planning, and researching we come to the The Silk Road&#039;s forum only to see a nation of people destroyed by the demise of one of the best marketplaces on earth. Our message to this society is this, (as you have heard before) The Silk Road&#039;s death is not the end. Though this community of people deserves to be woeful of what has happened this year. The destruction of the Silk Road has not only created turmoil but put thousands of dealers at risk of jail time which could become a drastic blow to all of the dark net... It&#039;s big news that major dealers in the UK have been raided and plenty more in the US and beyond. From the very beginning there was issues. The first 1-2 years D.P.R left a huge personal trail out of common inexperience, and we are not going to speculate but the latest bust from the FBI has been said to have been an inside job. Let this be heard across this forum: To us, the silk road was only a beta version. That was then, this is now. We do not have a name, we don&#039;t have a name because a name gives a target and we will never be targeted. We are a group of 1-20 people, extremely experienced in web coding and business on the Deep Web. No one person controls us, but there is a specified chain of command to keep everything running smoothly and safely. We are normal people just as you are, we believe in free Markets and we know how to do it right. Enough talk, no more saying &quot;we will rise again&quot;, we have already risen, we are already assembled and all that is left is to share what we are capable of. Sadly enough we cannot do it alone. It takes more than just us. It takes dedicated servers, money for electricity, and more than that it takes time, which is the most valuable. This is your ticket for a new free market place, An official infinite market place that is built by the best so that this situation never happens again, and all it takes is an investor. Our goal is at the least 400btc to begin we will do this through our own funding but mostly through common donations and investments, anything helps even if everyone who saw this and donated only .1btc we would reach our goal. It&#039;s time to the beginning with no end. This is a new year. A new beginning. And things will change.<br />If you are willing to donate-1Dqf1eB9uMaMPuHGFTq6UA5FFAisMWFwS6<br />~PM me for investment opportunities <br />Regards
