				Guys. ..... first of all I have no issue accessing my account ...... My question or problem is that I changed my Pass Phrase and PIN last night because I did a deposit and felt better safe than sorry both are strong. My problem is when I tried logging on to the forums with my new PIN it would not allow me to log on. I thought maybe just by chance the up date settings were not updated. So I used the original pin and was able to log on to the forums. <br /><br />BUT in order to log on to the SR account the required pass phrase WAS updated and required me to use the new / recently updated pass phrase. I still have to use the original PIN to get to the forums. I may have had to do a separate pin for the forums but I didn&#039;t think so ( I may be wrong though ) If you guys tell me that there is a different pin for completing a transaction on SR versus logging on to the forums then I apologize for wasting your time I just don&#039;t remember ever doing a separate pin for the forums. I just changed the pin on the account settings page again and again I had to use the original pin to be able to write this message.

Your PIN is only required when you are making transactions on Silk Road. Your passphrase, along with your username, is required when you are logging in to Silk Road.<br /><br />Your forum account does not have a PIN, it has a passphrase, and that is something that only you know. Your forum account and your Silk Road account were set up separately so it is entirely possible that you used a different passphrase for both.<br /><br />Libertas
