And this wasn&#039;t that long ago.<br />Very honest vendor I had but he dissapeared from the face of the earth.<br />&nbsp;SR needs domestic US high quality uncut pure mephedrone badly.Of course cut meph with mdpv was f-ed up.

				Limitless UC Mephedrone is some good shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am having the spins from withdrawl.&nbsp; I hate the electric shocks too.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Man Mephedrone is fun when you first meet but coming off a 5-6 gram binge is tough.

				Not if you want to keep your wallet fat and your nose in good shape.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus like I said withdrawl symptons AKA Serotonin syndrome. &quot;Electric shocks through the whole body,&nbsp; brief moments of scary paralysis, the spins.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh and my wallet is like skinny.&nbsp; &nbsp; I binge like 5-6 grams in a 12 hour period.<br /><br />I&#039;m fried from it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On a good note after a few days the shocks go away and you can go back to a normal life.&nbsp; sometimes it can last for a couple weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;The brief moments of paralysis is what scares the hell out of me.

				IMO,&nbsp; Mephedrone is way better than Methylone. Methylone wares off fast.

I was moving shitloads of the stuff and had it on-tap to snort whenever I wanted.<br /><br />Towards the end of it all I began suffering from really bad paranoia and I started thinking my closest friends were plotting to rip me off and snitch me into the police. I even suspected my own girlfriend and my family told me they were worried about me because I was actually really suspicious and on-edge all the time when they saw me. Me knees and elbows were an almost constant shade of blue and getting a hard-on took some serious work because my circulation was so bad.<br /><br />Everytime I went to sleep I would suffer from moments of sleep paralysis, and a sensation of an electric shock going through my brain. That&#039;s what really started to scare me. Luckily for me my supply dried up and I got off the Drone, and by the time I was able to get it again here I had the addictive part of my personality under control.<br /><br />Be careful!
