Contact SR support. Bottom right corner on any SR screen. <br /><br />Good Luck

				Should be no more than 24 hours. They do get 1,000&#039;s of issues daily so bear that in mind. <br /><br />Make sure the subject line of your message conveys the gravity of the situation best. <br /><br />Like &quot;Lock out of account due to PIN# trbl - Just about to make 1st purchase&quot;<br /><br />(you can fit a lot of info in the subject line ever since the latest update)<br /><br />I feel for you. - You can always browse the site under a new account in the meantime. Perhaps, do a little more window-shopping? :-*<br /><br />(best I can do-sorry)

				Yup, as said above, its just SR security measures that kick in IF someone is entering the wrong pin. I think it was if you entered it wrong five times then you&#039;d be locked out for a short while.<br /><br />Its unfortunate, but you should always remember your pin!<br /><br />From SR&#039;s point of view, anyone entering 5 wrong pins could be a theif or hacker. Either way its a good policy just in case the missus discovers my pin and orders an 8 ball of yayo when I want hash! <br /><br />You will be ok.<br /><br />Temporary glitch and a lesson to remember that pin next time!<br /><br />Also, unless I&#039;m wrong, vendors had to wait longer than that a while back if they forgot a pin.<br /><br />Lesson of the day....<br /><br />Don&#039;t foget your pin!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)
