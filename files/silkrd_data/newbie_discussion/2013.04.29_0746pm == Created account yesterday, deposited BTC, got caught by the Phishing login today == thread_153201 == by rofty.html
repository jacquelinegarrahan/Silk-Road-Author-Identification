				Typical....<br /><br />I must have glossed over any warning about not entering the PIN on the login page, being that it was my 2nd time logging in I didn&#039;t really think anything of it today.<br /><br />Is there anything I can do other than wait for the site to come back up and hopefully get on before the scammers?

				Op I hope you can beat the scammer to changing the password &amp; pin.&nbsp; I saw a thread the other day where people were loading up the phishing site with bad password/ pin combos so hopefully they have a ton of junk data to sift through when SR comes back live again.&nbsp;

				Oh well, you live an learn. Wasn&#039;t a lot of BTC thankfully. And they were given to me so no cost to me at all.<br /><br />Shame tho, some tasty produce on the road :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and refresh the site, but judging by my luck it will come back up the minute after I fall asleep tonight lol<br /><br />Thanks for the replies!

				god&nbsp; i fell for that too bak when i first started with sr... luckily i only had 0.18 btc and i was able to log in immediately and change everything so they didn&#039;t get shit, then i just emptied that account for a couple months. It was from a link on the hidden wiki for the SR, someone kept editing it to lead ppl to the phishing site. Ill never fall for that again :\

				Like others have said, if you can&#039;t access SR then neither can the scammer. You&#039;ll just have to keep checking and change your password / PIN. <br /><br />Hope everything ends well for you.

				tell me you arent searching for links to silkroad on the clearnet... if your searching for the silkroad on a regular search engine, with your real IP in full view...then just give up. You are probably being monitored already<br />that is such a NO NO

				If you didn&#039;t put a lot of btc, just wipe everything and start new. Also try to remember the address to the site, use some kind of neumonic to memorize it.

				SR is all over the clearnet already, it was on the front page of digg a few days ago IIRC. I doubt that a simple search for SR would be a big deal. That would be such a small lead for LE to hang on to. But then again, I&#039;m not LE so what do I know.
