				Ok,<br /><br />So I ordered some stuff from a UK vendor, It has not turned up. The total quantity was an O.&nbsp; It has 3 days left until the auto finalize kicks in &amp; have already entered the resolution stage.<br /><br />My query is, should I now be worried if my item was meant to be delivered UK to UK 11 days ago &amp; it has not? Iv had other stuff come too(not the same seller) since this and have had no problems? <br /><br />Also Im not sure what way the resolution part works, so a bit of info on the best way to proceed with my vendor would be a great help. The vendor has great feedback and I have had about 15 orders from UK/Europe &amp; beyond all come no problems since I joined the SR.<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />Yoker

You can read more about the ordering process and the options available to you here:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=The_ordering_process<br /><br />Packages can often take longer than expected to arrive but from what I have read it would seem that 11 days UK to UK is stretching it a bit. That being said it may still arrive! I would recommend requesting to extend the resolution by 5 days (this would kick in after the original 17 day period, for a total of 22 days) and if it still has not arrived by then request a refund.<br /><br />Libertas
