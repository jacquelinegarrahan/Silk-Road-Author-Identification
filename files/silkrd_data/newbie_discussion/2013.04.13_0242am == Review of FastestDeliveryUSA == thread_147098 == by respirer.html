				I&#039;d like to post a review in this vendor&#039;s official review thread, but with this 50-post minimum, it&#039;ll be a long time before I can. So for the second or third time, I&#039;m posting a review here.<br /><br />ï»¿This guy is great. He had a problem that kept him from shipping immediately, but he PMed to let me know and voluntarily upgraded my shipping to overnight. As a result I received the package today, the earliest it could conceivably have arrived by priority mail.<br /><br />Stealth was many-layered and elaborate, the last 2 layers vacuum sealed. On a 2g order, the weight came in at 2.24. I haven&#039;t smoked much hash in recent years, so I&#039;m probably not the best judge of potency. But 2 small chips totaling .08g have me nicely high. I&#039;d guess it&#039;s a sativa. The hash itself smells faintly like mint-chocolate chip ice cream. It&#039;s dry but pliable. And the smoke is smooth and pleasant. I&#039;m very likely to be a return customer. A+++

				My first order with this vendor was phenominal. Speed, quality of product, and the price were all extra-ordinary.&nbsp; But I gotta be honest and tune in with my current predicament. I placed and order last friday before the crash. After I placed my order, I sent him a message and&nbsp; didn&#039;t hear back from him before the crash. Now that silk road is back up, he still hasn&#039;t gotten back on and now he has no active listings. As frustrating as that is, its nothing to really whine about. My only issue is: I don&#039;t know if my order was hedged or not and BTC prices have dropped tremendously over the past week and I haven&#039;t been able to cancel my order yet and the admins are just too busy for me to bother them with my petty problems.<br /><br />As a vendor, I think FastestDeliveryUSA has a certain responsibility to at least check on things and respond to messages. Otherwise the name is completely misleading.<br /><br />-GB
