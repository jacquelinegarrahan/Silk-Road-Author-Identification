				Apparently when you can post off Newbie board, you will be unable to post back here.<br />So, most&nbsp; vetrans cant answer questions of newbies.

				Wouldn&#039;t that mean that all of the noobs who advance through the ranks will still be noobs at heart when they reach the main forums? I was under the impression that on the other boards everyone was glad to see the noobs weeded out.. now there will still be noobs, but their stats will obscure their true status. Another side effect of a erstatz fix i guess..
