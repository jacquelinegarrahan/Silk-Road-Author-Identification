				Hi there fellow psyconaughts&nbsp; <br /><br />I can only speak for myself as every one is different but for me being out in the woods is the best experience, pitch&nbsp; a tent with your hermano&#039;s and break out the Reefer and embrace the Good life. <br />Take some Orange Juice as the Vitamin C will take the edge off when you want to check in with the Reality Hotel for a nap lol<br />Good luck and get ready to piss your pants Laughing for 4 hours at&nbsp; least&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hahaha yea every LSD experience I had I literally laughed almost the whole trip...<br />I swear I developed a six pack haha..<br />One LSD trip me and my friends moved their whole living room (a couch, love seat and some recliners) into the front yard at like 3 am lol (ya bad idea seeing as they had neighbors.. But nothing bad happend) and we just stared at the stars all night haha.<br /><br />I have also had a bad trip on shrooms with it actually being my last and most recent trip..<br />Ate 6grams of dried p.cubensis and all was well til the end of the trip when I started feeling nauseated so i went to the restroom and threw up.<br />When I could actually focus on what I was throwing up I nearly shit my pants because I was throwing up blood. ( I have a pretty bad ulcer that acts up every once in a while)<br />I thought I was dying lol...it didnt occur to me at the time cuz i was tripping that eating dried shrooms was hard on my stomach lulz.<br />But with a little mindpower and with experiences with other minor &quot;bad trips&quot; I calmed myself down and the rest of the trip was manageable..<br />Its all in your head and telling yourself your just on a drug and it will eventually end is actually quite comforting.

				If you&#039;ve done shrooms, then you&#039;re good to go. Acid is a much more lucid experience, it doesn&#039;t mess with time/temporal continuity as hard, and like ratobhale said, the key to getting out of the woods is to remember the experience is temporary. Prepare to laugh for hours and feel like a genius.

				If you can, try to get a baby sitter. A perfect baby sitter is someone who has tripped before and will remain (relatively) sober. The babysitter will urge you on when you start going and will bring you up if you trip gets bad. If you smoke pot, smoke a bowl or joint after you take the acid.&nbsp; That way, the transition from rational to tripping will be easier. <br /><br />As other posts have mentioned, you might have a strong urging to be in nature. The great outdoors is truly majestic once your brain chemistry is altered. But, you might be in a mood to play video games or watch trippy shit on the computer or being social around people. <br /><br />Whatever you do man, be safe! Don&#039;t go into public alone or into any places that might give you a heart attack (roller coaster, laser light show, concert etc). Right now, you might not be ready for such a trip.

				Lol yea the random sober people line is spot on!<br />My first time I tripped we had all my friend furniture in his front yard. Well some of my friends are smokers and wanted some cigs so we walked to a local CVS at like 2am and on our way walking (side story lol) we walked by a suburban that had EVERY single door open on it..<br />I kept saying &quot; Man we needa a jet if the cops come they are gunna have a hay day with us.. Lol 5 of us tripping on cid so late at night haha.<br />Well anyways we make it to our destination and I accompany one of my friends who is also tripping inside to purchase the cigs. BAD IDEA!<br />Lol I get inside and we are waiting and this guy infront of me had a tyedye shirt on and OMG dude I started giggling cuz it kept moving and swirling then next thing I know Im full on LOLing and there was like 4 or 5 people in line just staring at me haha so I walk outside and wait for our friend with my other friends.<br />Well eventually he comes out and we have our shits and giggles about the shirt and start walking back.<br />Well next thing I know is I noticed 2 of the guys following us down the block and turning on every block we turn.<br />A few of us start to trip as they start gaining ground on us lol ( Us tripping jus being &#039;noid as fuck haha)<br />well eventually we turn down 1 block and the 2 fellows jus keep going straight to our relief lolzz<br />Sorry for the long story but MAN it was crazy haha

				Just relax,<br /><br />make sure no1 is going to show up at your place or call you with a problem.<br /><br />Don&#039;t do speed to meth and it can cause you to have a not as fun trip.<br />Don&#039;t smoke to much weed either unless you do normally then still lay off a bit because it will produce the same result as the latter.<br /><br />Pills are good to go with a trip though!! Candy flipping<br />Take the trip then 90mins later take the mdma pill and its the best.<br /><br />Also some tamazapane or vallium for when the night is over is also reccomended.<br />Or you can drink after its finished BUT DON&quot;T DO BOTH.<br /><br />IF IT DOES GO SOUTH?<br />Try and deal with it for30mins or so if you can&#039;t shake the bad/paranoid thoughts take the vallium and you will be fine in 30mins.<br /><br />Sorry to be negative but apart from relaxing and taking it easy before you start it wont be bad unless you start adding the wrong substances.<br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Be sure you&#039;re in a place where you feel safe, comfortable and cosy, where you&#039;re not going to be bothered by unexpected events for a few hours, that&#039;s really important. <br />&nbsp; Make that happy space really extra cosy with blankets, cushions,&nbsp; heaters, candles and incense if you feel like that stuff makes you feel good. <br />Your mindset will determine a lot of what you experience. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If you feel like crap and the toilet&#039;s busted and the landlord&#039;s a practicing Satanist Hell&#039;s Angel gang member Ninja who wants the last three weeks rent or else and he&#039;s coming round tonight it might not be the right time, you know?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure before you start the trip that you have some kind of plan for what you&#039;re gonna do, like have your favorite music&nbsp; handy, some of your favorite foods ready to enjoy,&nbsp; some musical instruments or paints and pens and sketch books, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re into. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Most importantly, if you have a trusted friend who&#039;s tripped before and is a kindly soul (who you know bears within themselves a certain amount of responsibility) see if they might be persuaded to spend some time with you while you&#039;re coming up and to help guide you at times when things might get as little rough (as they often do). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Timothy Leary stated in ,&#039;The Politics of Ecstasy&#039; that certain, experienced people should actually be licensed by a governing body to ensure that they are capable of guiding people who are tripping for the first time so that things don&#039;t turn into a psychological train wreck for them. That was in a society Dr. Leary envisioned that sadly has never occurred in officialdom (and I wonder how many &#039;acid casualties&#039; could have been saved the trouble had they listened to this man&#039;s intelligent guidance?)<br />&nbsp; Contrary to some of the advice given here, Dr. Leary also warned against indulging in other psychedelics such as marijuana during the initial stages of an LSD trip.It really is pretty potent stuff that you might want to enter into the effects of in a sober manner, oddly enough! <br />&nbsp; It&#039;s been scientifically proven that any task one can perform when unintoxicated one can also undertake if required to when tripping, and that even on a very high dose of LSD, so it&#039;s not like you&#039;ll be totally out of control. <br />You control the trip, don&#039;t let it control you, but that being said, flow with it too.<br />Have a nice trip.

				I would suggest gradually working your way up to the stronger psychedelics. Start with a few Salvia experiences, move to a few small psilocybin experiences, even some edible cannabis. I don&#039;t know what your past history with psychedelics are, but I probably wouldn&#039;t start with LSD. Psychedelics are not party drugs. Take them seriously. Set an intent for why your doing it. Prepare your mind beforehand. Don&#039;t take it for the first time as your walking into a concert. I believe the psychedelic experience an important part of the human experience and one that should be taken seriously. If your just looking to &quot;get crunked&quot; there are a lot of substances out there for that. LSD and psychedelics are not meant for that.

				I remember reading Leary referring to floating down a stream and going with it,there are copies of the guide he wrote online,it&#039;s worth a look. It helped me in the middle of pretty intense ayahuasca journey once.

				&nbsp; I would say if its your first time with anything chill with a sober friend. Someone who is chill and fun. Make plans to do it in a place with no other people, or people who are cool with the idea and won&#039;t fuck with you. Your plans don&#039;t have to be elaborate. Find a park that is close by to your place. Start tripping inside listening to music, and once you have reached cruising altitude go to the park or outside in nature for awhile.<br /><br />You only really need a basic plan. You don&#039;t really need any intense stimulation because well its Acid!!<br /><br />I&#039;ve had to interact with people who had no idea I was high as fuck on acid, and they don&#039;t notice for like a minute or so, but the more you talk to them they will realize that this person is talking the convo on tangents that are really out there. Its actually pretty funny. Like I&#039;ve told a few random people who didn&#039;t know, and they are super creeped out but absolutely fascinated at the same time.

				If you&#039;re not doin&#039; it alone, choose the right people, your friends, ppl you like. If you&#039;re a dude I&#039;d advise you not to trip with any girls (they can fucking FREAK OUT and ruin the whole thing), on the other hand, trippin&#039; with your gf can be the best thing in your life. Do not take it after midnight (unless you have no duties in the next 48 hours - such as work or doin&#039; anything that requires a lot of concentration and effort). You might also wanna stay away from the &quot;trip enhancers&quot;. For the come down I like to smoke some pot or drink a couple of beers. Never tried valium, but it seems like a good suggestion, too. The MDMA on top of lsd is a lot of fun as well.. Good luck, you&#039;ll be fine! ;)

				I can&#039;t believe I almost forgot a KEY ESSENTIAL of the trip! You need Oranges, Tangelos! Or whatever is your favorite citrous fruit. Peeling open one of those makes you feel like you are engaging in the same ritual as your ancestors. Its a wicked experience! Playing a board game like risk is a lot of fun because your more involved with people as opposed to a video game.<br /><br />As for music I&#039;m really surprised that everyone keeps saying the same old stuff like infected mushroom. <br /><br />If you want to see some really trippy newer stuff check out these tracks: Lick The Witch by TOBACCO, Electric by TEEN, Still Sound by Toro y Moi, Feel it all Around by Washed Out, Drugs in My Body by Thieves Like Us, Escape Velocity by The Chemical Brothers.<br /><br />Look for those videos on youtube. The videos are just as trippy as the songs themselves. There are some gems from my trippy collection enjoy.<br /><br />Let me know what you thought of them...

Best live shows period. Just watch any HD shows on of&nbsp; &#039;em widescreen tvs ;) Even tho I think it&#039;s kinda wasting a trip if you&#039;re watchin&#039; a tv.. I prefer interacting with ppl, thinking and exploring.

				If you can&#039;t get to nature (highly overrated in my opinion, I like my nature manicured&nbsp; ;) ) and you&#039;re tripping at night, try convincing someone to take you for a drive through any place that has lots of lights - like your red light district or entertainment district.&nbsp; Even roadwork bollard lights can be fun :)

				I can&#039;t TV during a trip either, my mind is going too much for that.&nbsp; I also don&#039;t think nature is for me, I am usually solo and it would freak me out to be stolling through the woods alone!

				I would spent a little time beforehand doing some self reflection and try to set an intent for your trip. Something you&#039;d like to work on. Continually remind yourself not to fight the experience, just allow it to happen. If things do start to turn negative than just calmly remind yourself that you are here to better yourself, and that you want a positive experience. Don&#039;t panic, that&#039;s the worst thing to do. Just accept wherever you go. Remember the less food you have in your stomach the stronger the experience is going to be. You could take identical doses, of identical product and have two totally different strengths based on how empty your stomach is. For the strongest experience you probably shouldn&#039;t eat for at least 10 hours beforehand. If you want to start slow I wouldn&#039;t do it on a totally empty stomach though.
