				Why not buy some pure heroin and go out peacefully? If you&#039;re going to use sodium pentobarbital, you gotta at least use a muscle relaxant beforehand so you pass out, i&#039;d imagine having your body shut down in real time in a matter of moments wouldn&#039;t be very nice to witness.

				I didn&#039;t know you were trying to commit suicide by overdose. <br /><br />Man, this breaks my heart to read this.&nbsp; Stay strong man.<br /><br />If you really want to go, i&#039;d definitely go with some sort of prescription drug or heroin.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to think that you don&#039;t go that route though.

				It sucks that it has come to that.&nbsp; I strongly support everyones right to take full control of their life especially if that means ending the pain.&nbsp; It&#039;s not sodium phentobarbital it&#039;s Potassium Cyanide.&nbsp; The guy also includes a download to the book &quot;The Final Exit&quot; which should have all the info you need about how to do it if you don&#039;t already know.&nbsp; Alternatively if this doesn&#039;t work look up an &quot;exit bag&quot; on google and /or look up that book.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry that you&#039;re hurting, brother.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the link:&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/62806edf01&nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck man.&nbsp; Go in peace.

				Michael,<br />Damn this is fucking ghoulish, but helium seems to be the best way to go.&nbsp; No pain, No vomiting the meds, or missing a vein. It&#039;s even said that the brain cannot distinguish Helium from Oxygen, and the decedent goes out in a state of euphoria from the resulting hypoxia.&nbsp; A few bucks at a party supply store is all that it takes..............But you&#039;re not going anywhere. I sense that you still hope to regain your ability to eat.&nbsp; I get the feeling that you haven&#039;t done everything to resolve this issue.&nbsp; Medical marijuana which can alleviate pain and stimulate appetite is all over SR. There are countless therapies out there to fix what a lame surgeon has fucked up.&nbsp; Hell brother, only getting 70 years would be a gyp. If you could eat like your old self, you would go on living right?

				Obviously we don&#039;t know your full medical details.. but where the surgeons fucked up, there&#039;s a possibility to fix, no? even if you have to take a shitload of cocaine to hide the pain.. (if you have the money) you could do that for as long as you can until the doctor comes up with a solution for you. I&#039;m just saying.. if theres still life in you.. which there clearly is as your communicating with us now... then hold onto it, instead of&nbsp; wasting what you have left with a quick overdose. Your choice though. Just a suggestion.

				I&#039;ve always said if I had a reason to top myself that heroin would be the way to go. Ingest a couple of grams and slowly drift off into nothing. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s an easier way. If that&#039;s what you want to do.
