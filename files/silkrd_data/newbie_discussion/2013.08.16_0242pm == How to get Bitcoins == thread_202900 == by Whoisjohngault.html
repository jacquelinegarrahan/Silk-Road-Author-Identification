				Hi. Welcome to Silk Road.&nbsp; For bitcoins it differs on location for the best method to use.&nbsp; If you are in the US I&#039;d suggest you go to localbitcoins.com.&nbsp; There you will be able to find someone you can buy your bitcoins from.&nbsp; They offer a ton of different payment options (find the one that&#039;s easiest for you and that you are most comfortable with.&nbsp; I suggest the bank deposit option as this is the easiest, fastest, and a good way to stay anonymous.) you&nbsp; usually get your bitcoins within the hour if not instantly.&nbsp; Once you have purchased your coins you can send them from your wallet to bitcoinfog and then your SR wallet. (search it in the search box) <br /><br />If you have any more questions feel free to ask.&nbsp; If you are outside the US i&#039;m sure there are plenty of others who can help you better than I.

				Odd, thanks for the info and helpin me out. I saw some good things about localbitcoin on another post in the forum and will definitely check it out.<br /><br />As far as some of the exchanges are they just a rip off with the fees or do they ask for more information than say the deposit option you were talking about with localbitcoin?<br /><br />Thanks again!

				At this point i believe the other exchanges have pretty much closed up shop for the anonymous buying of bitcoin.&nbsp; I do believe there are a few exchanges out there where you can buy your coins at market price but you have to hand over lots of identifying information.&nbsp; Since buying bitcoins is not illegal in theory there is no harm in doing this.&nbsp; If LEO are eventually able to trace those coins to you and the purchase of something illegal will it become a problem.&nbsp; But at this point in time i can pretty much promise you if you are buying BTC with your real identity there&#039;s a good chance some government agency now has some interest in you. From what i can tell the main issue people are having with the exchanges that are still around today is they are difficult to use and the wait times are rather long.&nbsp; I do not have much experience with the exchanges other than mtgox and bitinstant but they are no longer an option anymore.&nbsp; Someone else may be able to clarify more on that.&nbsp; IMO if you want coins safely and quickly and easily hands down i&#039;d go with localbitcoins
