				&nbsp;On maintaining the trust of Silk Road’s users: (after a Silk Road outage raised concerns among users that the site’s administrators might have run off with the funds stored on the site)[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“I know this whole market is based on the trust you put in me and I don’t take that lightly. It’s an honor to serve you and though you don’t know who I am, and have no recourse if I were to betray you, I hope that as time goes on I will have more opportunities to demonstrate that my intentions are genuine and no amount of money could buy my integrity.[/font]<br /><br />[/font]<br />Especially you old hats that have been around since the beginning, but this goes for everyone, you all are like family to me. Sure we have some crazy cousins floating around, but they just add character, right? Doesn’t matter though, I love you all. Of all the people in the world, you are the ones who are here, in the early stages of this revolution. You are the ones getting this thing off the ground and driving it forward. It is a privilege to have you by my side. Thank you for your trust, faith, camaraderie and love.” <br />[/font]<br /><br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=75916.msg602273#msg602273)[/font]<br />On the “heroes” who sell drugs on Silk Road:[/font]<br /><br />[/font][/font]<br />“There are heroes among us here at Silk Road. Every day they risk their lives, fortunes, and precious liberty for us. They are on the front lines making tough decisions and working their asses off to make this market what it is. Of course I am talking about our vendors. I won’t try to acknowledge them individually because we are blessed with so many extraordinary people who have stepped up to the task and taken it upon themselves to find a way to stock the shelves at Silk Road. They labor tirelessly to balance the heavy responsibilities they’ve taken on. From customer support, to supply chain and inventory management, to promotion, to quality control, to risk management and mitigation, to IT, to Bitcoin finance, to order fulfillment, and on and on, these guys and gals are professionals that are rising to the top of their game.”[/font]<br /><br /><br />###<br /><br /><br />End Part III, cont&#039;d in Part IV<br />&nbsp;(http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=13347.msg127993#msg127993)[/font]<br />&nbsp;
