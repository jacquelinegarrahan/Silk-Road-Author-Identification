				I logged in today to finalize on a couple orders and noticed I can only leave bullshit premade statements.<br /><br />The feedback system here was an awesome tool for buyers.&nbsp; I used it just last week on some blow because I was light and sure enough the past 10 comments were about the vendor being light.<br /><br />I also used it to gauge who had the best H many times.&nbsp; <br /><br />Through custom feedback it&#039;s super easy for buyers to talk about what vendors are light on their orders, what vendors have the primo product, etc, etc.&nbsp; Feedback is simple, right there, and easy to use.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, no more feedback, do I have to login into the forums to find out the skinny on what vendors are up to?

				The ratings system and the feedback (review) system have been separated. You can still leave feedback by going either to the vendors main page after finalizing (and rating) or through your account link. There are two threads started by DPR on this board that detail the changes, as well as the wiki over at SR.

				Yes and guys please keep using the review/feedback section.&nbsp; After your order is complete, there will be a &quot;review&quot; button the vendor page that you can use to writeup the feedback.&nbsp; This is obviously critical as we as buyers use that information to see what our peers have to say about the vendor.&nbsp; You know stuff like was the stealth good.&nbsp; Was the product good.&nbsp; All that good stuff.&nbsp; You&#039;re not alone in the way you feel about the new feedback system.&nbsp; While I wouldn&#039;t put it the way you did, there has been a lot of negative response over on the sections of the forums.&nbsp; This aspect that you mentioned is the most disappointing part of the new update because buyers have to hunt down the review page to write the feedback instead of having it conveniently located in the same spot as the 1-5 rating.&nbsp;
