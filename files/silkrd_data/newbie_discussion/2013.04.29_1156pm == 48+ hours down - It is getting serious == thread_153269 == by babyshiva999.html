				There are discussions about this going on the other boards, so let us noobs give out 2 satoshis on this very serious matter. <br /><br />First of all there seems to be a lot of paranoia around that it&#039;s the government doing it. I like a healthy dose of paranoia, but this makes absolutely no sense:<br /><br />1. This is a 20 milllion usd per year venture, it&#039;s nothing to them, not a competition to their 500 plus billion monopoly on heroin in Afghanistan and multi trillion cocaine business in South America.<br /><br />2. If the CIA/DEA/FBI or whomever wanted to halt the tor drug trade they would attack all three main sites at the same time, and BMR and Atlantis seem to work flawlessly.<br /><br />There&#039;s been another foolish theory going around that this is just another boring kid doing a DDOS attack. No siree. No fucking way. This is highly sophisticated and organized attack, and besides hackers always want something, be it money, or whatnot. <br /><br />So this leaves us with the competition. BMR is the second biggest site after SR, and they would have the most to gain. So my proposition is that they are probably paying some collective serious dough to do it.&nbsp; I cannot prove it and I might be wrong, but this is the most plausible explanation to me?<br /><br />It&#039;s the age old question: Cui Bono - To Whose Benefit ?<br /><br />Would&nbsp; love to hear your thoughts, comments, insights on this. Because if this goes on, many vendors will have to move on - it&#039;s the nature of the marketplace, the rule of business. <br /><br />Peace,

Tor connectivity is spotty(to say the least) on a good day,&nbsp; I would suspect that a DDOS could be launched with a relatively small zombie-net at almost no cost to the person controlling the attack. Why do it? To see if they can perhaps. It could be a diversionary tactic for a much larger con their playing. Though it is also entirely possible this is nothing more than a person in control of a zombie-net doing it for the lulz, who knows? To suggest this is a government organized attack is a little premature and does nothing but make people who are already getting paranoid and antsy even more paranoid and antsy(with good reason). I&#039;m not saying it couldn&#039;t be a major attack, but I think there&#039;s too little known(to those of us who aren&#039;t DPR) right now to suggest this is the end of the world.

I&#039;m certainly not claiming to be an expert, nor am I in any way saying there&#039;s no reason to be worried; just that I think it&#039;s too soon to start thinking the government is coming after us. But it&#039;s better to express your concerns to see what other people are thinking than to sit and stew on them and worry yourself into having an ulcer. From what I&#039;ve seen in my short time on the Onion Network, some of the most used websites can go down for days at a time due to the nature of how the cloud is designed.

				I doubt it&#039;s the other site doing the attack, honestly.&nbsp; Really, why should they bother?&nbsp; They don&#039;t have that much to gain, most people will just wait for SR to come back up.

				I&#039;ll tell you one thing...I&#039;m fucking pissed! I just found the SR and I can&#039;t even try it out because of all the DDOS attacks! I&#039;m trying to do my research, find a good vendor, and make some small purchases and then&nbsp; &quot;Sorry...tor is unable to connect to....&quot; FUCKING ANNOYING! <br /><br />As far as theories, this is definitely no bored kid, not unless it&#039;s the next Mark Zuckerburg or some shit! These attacks are sophisticated, obviously! That being said I think it&#039;s one of three scenarios. One: the competition has paid some really smart dudes to take the SR down. Two: The feds have decided there is no legal way to stop the SR, so they use the hackers way. Three: Someone has decided to see what fucking with SR would do to bitcoin value.<br /><br />No matter what is REALLY going on, it sucks, big time!!!<br />I feel like the kid who has been trying to get to the candy store forever, and now that I&#039;m here it&#039;s fucking closed.....ARRRRRRGHHHH!

Keep researching, get to know the ins and outs as much as possible. Either the site comes back up and you are more prepared, or the site doesn&#039;t come back up and you move to Atlantis or BMR, to which most of the same lessons learned in your research apply.
