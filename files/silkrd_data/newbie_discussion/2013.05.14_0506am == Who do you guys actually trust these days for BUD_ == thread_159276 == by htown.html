				Just wondering if you guys can give me a up to date list of good vendors.. I ve tried a few but alot of the times there is no active listings. <br /><br />darkexpresso is a good choice. Always been nice and always get 5 days max.<br />HumboldtsFinest another good choice. Always been nice and always get 5 days max. <br />caerus is the shit. Hes always cool and hooks me up. When I have ordered always 3 days max.<br />anonymart has tons of stuff to choose from. His listings are back up! He does not ship Priority. 1-2 weeks for delivery but you can trust them. <br />Last but certainly not least farmer1 is a guy you go to if you want DANK. You know what to expect when you order from them but you pay more. <br /><br />I know there are more vendors but these are the ones I use for bulk and would like to know yours. <br />

				@ Theory<br /><br />with all the precautions taken in packaging, smell shouldnt be a problem if your vendor knows his business.&nbsp; I would think buying a large bag of weed domestically would be less risky than all these international orders.&nbsp; Those scare me&nbsp; &nbsp;=(

				Never bought bud on the road.&nbsp; I&#039;m lucky enough to live in an area where topshelf nugs are easy to find IRL.&nbsp; International orders definitely seem like a bad idea to me.&nbsp; Ganja is just so light it seems like packages would have to be so large for relatively small amounts.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious how bud vendors&#039; stealth strategies compares to powders?&nbsp; MMB bags at the very least I&#039;d hope.&nbsp;

				I got a sample from vendor Slkhkk. He is in the Czech Republic where medicinal cannabis use has been legalized. It took a day to get to the UK, don&#039;t ask how - I just messaged him to say thanks and he retorted with &quot;I only posted it yesterday&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, the packaging is really stealthy, I couldn&#039;t smell it until I was practically holding it! It smells good, and tastes good, and gives a nice stoney buzz (I&#039;m not the best at writing reviews)<br /><br />But yeah, check him out and give a new vendor some love. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/671f59d9e4 <br /><br />
