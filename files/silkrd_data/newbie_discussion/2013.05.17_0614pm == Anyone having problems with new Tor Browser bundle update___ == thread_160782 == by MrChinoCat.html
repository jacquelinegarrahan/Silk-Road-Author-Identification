				Since Monday every time I open my Tor Browser I get a message that says &quot;Security update available for Tor Browser&quot; followed by a link to the download page. On the download page there is no update download, but just a download for Tor Browser bundle. So I assumed this download is just a new version and I downloaded it. After downloading I unzip and try to run this new version, but I get an error message that says &quot;Error code 2: Tor exited abnormally&quot; and then two crazy ass gibberish files appear in the directory. I&#039;ve tried re-downloading a few times, as I thought perhaps the download was corrupted en route. Needless to say it&#039;s the same thing every time. Anyone else having issues like this?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />ChinoCat

Not useless at all actually. I was thinking that could be the problem, but didn&#039;t want to be stuck without a working Tor Browser. I think I will try that, as it seems like a logical fix.

				Someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong here but isn&#039;t tor a standalone program? Meaning it doesn&#039;t need to be installed?<br /><br />You basically have to delete the old tor bundle directory and download then extract the updated version and start using that. <br /><br />If your using windows, even though the bundle download is a .exe file I think it just unpacks the tor bundle to the directory of your choice.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking if you&#039;ve download the new version and your still getting the update message then your still using the tor in the old directory, delete that and start using the new version.

It was my own stupid mistake. I downloaded the 64-bit, and I should have downloaded 32-bit. I got confused because my machine is dual boot with Win7 and Ubuntu (side note: Ubuntu is FAR better than windows) and my Win7 side is 64-bit, but Ubuntu is 32-bit. Once I remembered that I downloaded the correct version and presto...got my secure updated version of Tor Browser working like a charm! Sorry for the confusion you guys, and thanks for the replies!<br /><br />ChinoCat

Shit no. I may be lazy but not THAT lazy :) Using the TOR browser bundle on Mac OSX. I think there&#039;s an update available but I don&#039;t know and won&#039;t be arsed to install more crap. I see the update thing and just shrug and go &quot;that&#039;s for Windows people,&quot; and I move on. Grin.

				Dammit, Libertas! I just realized I forgot to use the word UPDATE.<br />I meant to say that I&#039;ve yet to download the bundle update. Took me a second to realize why you&#039;d asked that. It&#039;s been a longass day, sorry. <br />&nbsp;:o

				Hiya Aktion1314 <br /><br />I would prob advise updating you just click on the orange line that says update available, takes you to the Tor download page, default it will show the Windows download, and on the right it will say MacOSx. Just click on that, then the download icon, it will take less than a minute to download, and then from your downloads list that will appear as the latest numbered version. I&#039;m running 10.8.3, and you don&#039;t have to restart or anything. <br /><br />Given the nature of the community and activities you and I are involved with, why take any chance on security? Better safe than sorry, I suggest.<br /><br />Take care.
