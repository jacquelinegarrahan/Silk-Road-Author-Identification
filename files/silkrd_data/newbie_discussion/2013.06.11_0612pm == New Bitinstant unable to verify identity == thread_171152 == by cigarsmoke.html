				Ive been having problems with buying bitcoins anonymously with the new bitinstant. And thats the only way ive known how to buy bitcoins with out being traced. on there new and improved website you can either sign up with bitinstant which asks you a whole bunch of question about your personal information that im not willing to give them, and another way to buy bitcoins on that site is to use it as a guest option, i proceed buy using the cash deposit to my bitcoin silk road wallet and then it displays another page wanting more information about me i give them the usually fake info that i used to do and use a tormail email, once ive completed that section of the forum it say &quot;UNABLE TO VERIFY IDENTITY&quot;&nbsp; what am i doing wrong? and is there other alternative options buying bitcoins anonymously?<br />

				I had the same problem yesterday with bitbargain wanted proof of my identity. <br />needless to say I fucked them right off. <br />after liberty reserve I think the larger Exchanges are looking to insulate themselves from any accusations of wrong doing. <br />

				I would recommend using one of the established bitcoin vendors on the road.&nbsp; If you go to the money section you&#039;ll see there are a couple of users with perfect feedback and a ton of transactions who can accept moneypak in exchange for bitcoins.&nbsp;

				First, someone said there is a money section?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see that on the forums, this is probably a dumb question, but can you tell me how to get there?<br /><br />Also, buying bit coins is not illegal, however, this new account creation page sucks.<br /><br />Though, you can still put in fake info and use a mailinator email address and you should be fine.

				If you want to buy bitcoins without proving identity first you can either go to localbitcoins.com and buy from a regular joe assuming there is someone selling close enough to you or as of right now you can still buy coins from Blue Sky Traders (http://ok2yri46aaptiu2d.onion/index.htm) without proving ID. They just have you make a cash deposit into their Bank of America account and BOA does not require any of your information to make the deposit.

				So can we use the guest mode then or do we have to register?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how they&#039;d be able to confirm my information if I tried to register.&nbsp; I&#039;ve made many deposits in the past with fake information.&nbsp; I just use the same information every time.&nbsp; Fake number, real address (business here in town), fake name.&nbsp;

GOX.....but you can save yourself a fee and deposit right into SR....once I do that, i changed my address&nbsp; on SR......so I&#039;m not sure how much more I need to do,&nbsp; to be safe.....the only weak link in the chain is&nbsp; having to show ID when paying.,....and so far i haven&#039;t had to do that....I hope that don&#039;t change.. the only time you have to register is when you withdraw cash, then they want to know who you are.....

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.

				I buy btc about once every three months and usually go bitinstant. Today when I tried to use their service I got a &quot;Sorry, we are currently having issues with one of our partners&quot; message several times and was unable to move past the Name/Phone number page.<br /><br />Anyone else see this or know anything about it?
