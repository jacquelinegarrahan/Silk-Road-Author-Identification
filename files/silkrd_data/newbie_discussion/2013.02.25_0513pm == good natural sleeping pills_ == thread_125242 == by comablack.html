				Ambien can put you to sleep, yes, but it often tends to not *keep* you asleep. It&#039;s also not natural, and at higher doses (10mg and above) it can do funky things to your short term memory, induce odd behaviors, etc. Another unnatural sleep aid is dyphenhydramine (yes, Benadryl, available anywhere, cheapest by far at CostCo). This is the exact same chemical that&#039;s used in over the counter sleep aids like Sominex and in night-time cold medicines. Typical dose is 25mg (one pill). 50mg in a pinch, but it can give you a bit of the groggies in the morning. More than that generally isn&#039;t a good idea. In fact, it can actually keep you awake with something that feels like restless leg syndrome.<br /><br />But! You were asking for natural sleep aids. I can recommend valerian root (no, it is not related to valium). Nature&#039;s Way makes a decent standardized valerian in capsule form. Start with one capsule to see how it affects you, because (like diphenhydramine) and can make you groggy the next day. I found that two was all right, more than that was counterproductive. It&#039;s also available as a tea. Be warned: it&#039;s stinky, weird-smelling stuff.<br /><br />If you get the herb or the tea, stick to single ingredient (that is, no &quot;valerian plus other stuff&quot;).<br /><br />Other than the aforementioned and valid exercise/diet/sleep schedule lifestyle changes, the other important thing to do is to avoid caffeine within about six hours of hitting the sack. Caffeine is metabolized in several stages, if you have coffee at say 5:00PM you&#039;ll still be on the tail end of that if you&#039;re getting to bed at 11:00PM That includes soda as well.<br /><br />Me, I&#039;m up at an ungodly hour in the fucking AM because I am full of hydrocodone. But my eyes are blurry which means my head is crying for feathers.<br /><br />Good luck!

				A valerian root supplement works pretty well. Gives you strange dreams though. 2mg klonopin usually gives me the best night sleep ever, but if its natural you want try the valerian. Exercise and healthy diet helps too as has been mentioned.

				I wouldn&#039;t recommend using opiates as a sleep aid. You&#039;ll soon get a rebound effect to where you can&#039;t sleep at all without it.

				Unless you&#039;re malnourished or old, melatonin supplements will do you no good... Instead, try to establish a regular sleeping pattern. Go to bed the same time every day, get up the same time every day. If you can&#039;t sleep, get up, do something for 30-45 minutes, and go to bed again. Do not use your bed for anything else than sleeping (or sex). Do not watch TV in bed! Establish pre-sleeping rituals (like brushing your teeth) and stick to them, to teach your subconscious that when x happens, it&#039;s time to sleep. When you&#039;re lying in bed, do not think of the day to come, but reflect on the day that passed instead.

				Good god! How could I forget 5-HTP? I actually take 100mg every night for general brain maintenance, but when I first started taking it it was as effective as (and gentler than) Ambien. I think of valerian as an &quot;acute&quot; (i.e., I need to go to sleep right frickin&#039; now) solution, and 5-HTP is a long-term solution.<br /><br />Agreed about the opiates: bad idea for sleep. It seems counterintuitive, but the nods are not the same for your brain as gen-yu-wine sleep, they don&#039;t refresh...and for me, a good dose is something I&#039;ll actually stay awake all night with, drifting and feeling good (like last night). Similarly, over the long haul benzodiazepines like Klonopin and Xanax actually work to prevent your brain from entering the full-on delta wave state that characterizes the deepest and most restorative portion of the sleep cycle. So although benzos will knock you out, the sleep is actually lighter and of worse quality.<br /><br />All of that said: your mileage may vary, everybody&#039;s body&#039;s different, so on and so forth. In truth any chemical/herbal solution should be temporary; lifestyle changes in support of proper sleep habits are the best (and cheapest) solutions.

				5-HydroxyTryptoPhan definitely the most natural.&nbsp; It&#039;s converted by your body into melatonin which is why it helps you sleep.&nbsp; It&#039;s also MUCH safer than taking melatonin (which is usually extracted from pig glands).

				What dosage of melatonin did you take? I&#039;ve found melatonin to be more effective at smaller doses and that larger dosages actually cause less of the desired effect.

				Just a warning to any of you who are taking 5-HTP on a daily basis.<br /><br />If you are an mdma user, do not take 5-HTP on nights that you decide to roll. Definitely NOT healthy for you.<br /><br />the day before and the day after help you rebound from it quicker though and I recommend that.. just don&#039;t take 5-HTP and mdma at the same time.

				If you do some biology research and look up melatonin you&#039;ll see that it only helps when you have a deficiency for some reason. Just adding more to an already healthy amount is no good. If there was a natural &#039;cure&#039; for insomnia (I&#039;ve had insomnia for 7 years and get between 1-6 hours of sleep a nigh, averaging about 3-4) then it would be famous.<br /><br />Things that help:<br />1) Exercise<br />2) A Banana<br />3) Hot milk or malted drink<br />4) Lavender<br />5) No caffeine after 7pm<br />6) No TV at least an hour before bed<br />7) Likewise no food at least an hour before bed<br />8) Any drink with hops in (a pint of something perhaps ;-) )<br />9) A wank or better yet a shag<br />10) ONLY USE YOUR BEDROOM FOR SLEEPING!!!<br /><br />I&#039;m now in psychotherapy because of my insomnia (and opiate addiction) but at least I sleep now... thanks Oxycodone! =D (ironic lol)

				Rohypnol. Two tablets should be enough. <br /><br />But on a serious side note, exercise and lots of it. It really works, but makes your body ache especially after lifting weights. I heard garlic helps you sleep too, if that doesn&#039;t work you could always try chloroform. I&#039;m beginning to sound like a rapist, even I&#039;m beginning to get worried. But as long as it is all in good fun....<br /><br />But in all honesty, go to a drug store (not Silkroad, a real one!) and see what they recommend. They should have some natural sleeping aids.

				Haha Cooler, you have some of the best replies on this board.<br /><br />If you are going to go off the &#039;natural&#039; route then temazepam is the way to go.<br />I was prescribed it and 2-3 a night would work. What&#039;s more is I&#039;d wake up refreshed not just having had slept.<br />However, it also made me moody as fuck and not very patient with people, decided it wasn&#039;t worth it in the end and coming off<br />it was like being shot in the face every morning.
