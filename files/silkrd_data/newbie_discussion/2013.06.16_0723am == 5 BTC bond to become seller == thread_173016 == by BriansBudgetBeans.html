				Wow, i just hoped to make a SilkRoad account to sell of some of my home produced cannabis seeds. But i need to pay 5 BTC to become a seller. Can that really be? It&#039;s like a third of my monthly salary. Is there any way around it or other sites i can use, that provides a similar service as SilkRoad?

				It&#039;s still a big investment. I would need 25 orders at 0.2 BTC to get them back. I&#039;m not sure my items are selling as good as yours&nbsp; ;)

				You don&#039;t PAY 5 BTC, its a bond. You get it back after 6 weeks and over 1500$ worth of trades.

				I still have to come up with $500, change them into bitcoins and transfer them to SilkRoad. And combining them and the $1500 i need to earn to get a refund, i&#039;m ending up with at least $2000 in bitcoins to spend. That&#039;s a awful lot, when i was just hoping to earn a few to BTC to spend on the site.

				I think it&#039;s a good rule, keeps some scammers away and makes for a more serious market with trusted vendors.

				I agree also, infact needs to be 2-5x the bond as there is still scammers....infact I find it shity that some vendors use resources, time and btc to hassle and hurt other vendors. We will soon update and post any possible or potential (risk) users to give others heads up.<br /><br />We have had 2 users try to get free shipments saying they bought but there was not record of orders using dates or transaction info we looked multiple times and then the fakes stopped asking.<br /><br />Also another worry is abusers who claim missing,lost or stolen,,,this is less of a risk and harder to prove, just a warning to other vendors!&nbsp; prepare for those users possibly too...<br />

				If you look at it this way; There are many vendors on SilkRoad making thousands a week easily. It&#039;s a little investment but if you&#039;re serious, you can make a massive amount of money alot safer than you can on the street. I wouldn&#039;t say SR is the place to get rid of a few seeds you have left over. (Unless you feel like selling your account after, which might even come out more than you bought it for if the btc rates fluctuate enough).<br />~D

				I think SR should keep 5 BTC than bail. and refund them more later. only if the seller is not a scammer!

				Weeds out a lot of scammers maybe? I&#039;m sure it ws 3.6 bitcoins just a few weeks ago when I became a seller. Lucky if so! Still looking forward to getting it back mind you.
