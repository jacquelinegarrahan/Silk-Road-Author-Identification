				I&#039; m a long time member, unfortunately I lost my forum pw.<br />It&#039;s about 5 month from my last order, I noticed that there are still many vendors who require FE but there are many others who have almost impossible to respect purchasing rules, I mean 0% refund rate on over 50 transaction is unrealistic on a statistic base, under 10% IMHO is the percentage that describe an honest buyer.<br />How do SR staff deal with vendors who requires &gt; 10 transactions AND 0% refund rate? I mean if a order got lost or it was never shipped, and it goes into resolution without any agreement between vendor and buyer ? <br />

				Not sure if there&#039;s much you can do. I&#039;ll either message the vendor and see if we can work something out, or just find someone else.<br /><br />Luckily my preferred cake has some amazing bakers who are willing to work with new buyers :)

				The FE/Purchasing rules are more like a guideline for me. You do not have to satisfy them, but if I notice something fishy I might require FE on a per client-basis, or if you have a refund/autofinalize rate of 7%+ just to be on the safe side. So far, only 2 people had an autofinalize/refund rate of 10%+

				There are some fairly cheap digital goods that should help you get above 50 transactions if your vendors are really being sticklers about it.
