				WHY ARE PEOPLE STILL USING THIS FORUM IF THE FEDS HAVE IT?<br /><br />I would call it a honeypot, but that would imply people didn&#039;t know the FBI is running this forum...<br /><br />WTF!?

				I do find it strange that this forum is still active. Implies that a staff member controls the secret key to the domain. Maybe when DPR&#039;s colo doesn&#039;t get paid that forums will go dark?

				I would say that the marketplace was on a different entity than the forums.<br /><br />The forums itself aren&#039;t illegal, it&#039;s the marketplace where the transactions are being made.
