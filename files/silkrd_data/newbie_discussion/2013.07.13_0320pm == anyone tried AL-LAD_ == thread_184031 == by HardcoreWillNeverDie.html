				I&#039;ve got some of AL-LAD, I&#039;ll be trying it soon. Though I&#039;m not sure of doage, does 200ug sound like a good number for a person who maxes out at around 300-400ug of LSD?

				It&#039;s vast right now because one synth was done for both chemicals and dosage is in microgram range. Even a few grams of this stuff is a lot. In a year current stocks will be depleted and definitely not be for sale anymore (if so, at a high premium from people&#039;s reserves). Maybe you will see someone bother to synth them again 10 years from now. But hey, I&#039;m the vendor so don&#039;t take my word for it... I&#039;ve only been doing drugs since the 90s and this is the first I&#039;ve encountered them. I&#039;ve considered putting my stock on ice for the next year and then bringing it back at premium price but who knows if SR will even be around then and I may not have a route of distribution. No need to be greedy...

You would be in the position/have the past aka experience to know such. As lucky as we(the community) are to get these novely chems I was hoping luck would be so vast that prices would drop to get a few hundred hits but understand this unique situation and still SHOULD stock up.
