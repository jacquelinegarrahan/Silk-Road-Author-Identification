				The SR buyers guide recommends I ship my package to a location other than the final destination for storage of said package. Sounds like a good idea, and I can see how this would protect against a potential police bust of my property, but I receive packages from Amazon and other internet vendors regularly. If I properly use my real name in the shipping process... ..... I&#039;m not over thinking this, am I? <br />Thoughts? How much do you feel comfortable with shipping direct to your personal residence?

				for personal stash amounts I wouldn&#039;t have qualms about using your own house and name. If someone does a sting (highly unlikely), you can always claim ignorance (or better yet say NOTHING and call your lawyer). <br /><br />LE is usually looking for the other end of the game.

				I think as long as you go through a good vendor and keep things on the small side, ordering locally (in your own country) there&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br /><br />But the risk vs reward factor changes a bit when you start ordering schedule I stuff - I&#039;d just be a nervous wreck waiting for that stuff to come...<br />

				Perosnal amounts I have not even the slightest worry about using my real name and getting them sent straight to my door, my only concern would be not getting them... because I want them :D<br /><br />I&#039;m about to start ordering semi-bulk amounts of eckies, and I&#039;ll be getting them straight to my door, using my real name... and still my only concern is that they don&#039;t arrive, because I want them :D<br /><br />I would maybe start being slightly concerned if I was ordering thousands of pills, or ounces of powder frequently or something. But I&#039;ll probably never be doing that, and if I was I would probably still just get it sent to mine using my real name and hope that they couldn&#039;t pin anything on me if it got stopped. I&#039;d maybe try and get it out of my house as soon as possible after it arriving or something. Or maybe the other way round, ask a friend to get it delivered to them and then moved to mine, but that may be a bit unfair on them.

Most of the people I know would be happy to get stuff delivered to their houses for the same reason that I am happy to do it. So far the only reason friends of mine aren&#039;t ordering from SR is because of technical barriers (or rather, imagined technical barriers... it&#039;s not exactly rocket science). But I would definitely not feel comfortable paying someone to do that for me, that would feel a bit like unfair coercion or taking advantage of them needing money. <br /><br />As for ordering from overseas, I think that may depend on your country. I&#039;m UK and I don&#039;t think our authorities pursue these things as aggressively as, for example, the US or Australia. I think they would also have some difficulty actually making a charge stick for you getting drugs, even bulk, delivered to your door unless you were dumb enough to either start blabbering when the police turn up, or be dealing the drugs directly from the delivery address.

				You think they&#039;re getting a warrant for a dime bag or an ounce or 2 of weed? No. I know a postal worker, they don&#039;t care it shake rattles or rolls. Throw it in a bag, seal it a couple times with a vacuum sealer or mylar if its gonna take a while to get to its destination Take soap and water to clean the vacuum bag or&nbsp; clean with a dishwasher f its a bigger pack ;), make sure you get in that flap at the top of the vacuum seal. And your good to go. Whether you hide it or not is up to you. I do use stealth. But it&#039;ll get there for the most part via usps whether express or priority. Been doing it for years. Never lost one package. Had a scare once because it was a holiday. But the person on the other end got it. If someone here says i didn&#039;t get it and the dcn says delivered. I&#039;ll know they&#039;re running a scam. You can send it to your grandmoms house. If its stealth correctly and she opens it. She&#039;ll just say, &quot;You got this in the mail today&quot;.

				A good one I&#039;ve heard (if you&#039;re super paranoid about even getting small amounts for personal use &amp; don&#039;t need to use the product the day it arrives) is to have it addressed to a believable fake name or the name of a previous occupant of the property, then when it arrives cross out the name &amp; write &quot;NOT AT THIS ADDRESS, RETURN TO SENDER&quot; on the envelope then sit on it for a couple days. The only way they&#039;ll get you for a small amount is if they happen to have detected the package at the post office so they&#039;d either do a controlled delivery or knock on your door before you have a chance to smoke it, in which case you have (legally) plausible denyability that you don&#039;t know what was in the package.<br /><br />Not that I think it matters though - depending on your jurisdiction, to paraphrase Stringer Bell the police usually have better things to do than go out of their way to stop individual people getting high. Since you can&#039;t give them any info on the dealer you got it from, them trying to get buyers would be more trouble than its worth. <br /><br />I&#039;ll start getting worried when politicians start crusading about SR after some 15yr old middle class white girl ODs on something off here though.

				My personal threshold is, I&#039;m not buying anything that&#039;s worth the police&#039;s time. So I get it to my address, under my real name, and that&#039;s how it goes. But, if I was buying like ounces of coke, I&#039;d probably use my friend&#039;s apartment. He only lives there like half the year, but still gets mail almost everyday. Just would be like an hour drive, and I haven&#039;t had any problems.

				I could be way off on this, but my thinking is it&#039;s better to order from overseas (not domestically) in case the dealer got busted and had kept your address info. I don&#039;t think law enforcement from another country would bother forwarding your info to your local gestapo. I only order lsd though, so I don&#039;t think that would be detected by customs.

				Regarding law enforcement, lsd is a Schedule 1 drug in most countries, although that is completely unfair. I think penalties depend on if you have a prior criminal record, and the quantity (possession vs distribution). 25 hits would probably fall under possession assuming your record is clean.
