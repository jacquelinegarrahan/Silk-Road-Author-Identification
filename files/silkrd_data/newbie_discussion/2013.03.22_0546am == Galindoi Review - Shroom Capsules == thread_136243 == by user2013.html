				This is a review of the shroom capsules sold by Galindoi.&nbsp; <br /><br />Communication - 5/5<br />Shipping - 5/5 (3 days!)<br />Packaging - 6/5 (stealthy, looked like any other vitamin.&nbsp; Cool swag included that will definitely be my flag at this summer&#039;s festivals!&nbsp; doesn&#039;t lie when he/she says you&#039;ll get more than you&#039;re ordering to make up for any discrepencies.)<br />Product - ?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but plan to very soon.&nbsp; I&#039;ll update this when I do.&nbsp; I&#039;m expecting good results, though because every other review has been strong!<br /><br />Overall - 5/5&nbsp; I&#039;ll be back, unless the product disappoints (doubtful).&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend you give this vendor a shot to earn your trust.

				Galindoi, I hope you make your way to the Newbie forum to see how much the service you provide means to now-loyal customers like me. A very close friend and I took 5 and 6 capsules, respectively, and had an amazing experience as briefly described below.<br />6/5 Shipping &amp; Stealth<br />6/5 Customer Service<br />Amazing product, well worth the time, effort, and expense.<br /><br />Trip lasted ~5 hours, after effects lasted well into the next day. I was absolutely GLOWING.<br />OEV and CEV, smooth up and down, little to no nausea. GREAT experience.<br />Your product may very well have helped my friend create a beautifully designed and wonderfully written piece of literature.<br />I solved something in my life that I didn&#039;t even know was an issue... a well disguised and deeply hidden insecurity that was peacefully and quite logically resolved over the course of the trip.&nbsp; Thank you.<br /><br />Galindoi, I have learned so much about myself and I am so grateful for your providing me with these beautiful tools.<br />Thank you so much! HIGHLY recommended!<br />FL

				Just broke my long-term SR lurking streak and made Galindoi&#039;s product my first purchase- very psyched to give these a whirl (!) and I&#039;ll be sure to post the details. S/he&#039;s been a pleasure to work with so far (responded really quickly to messages)

				You won&#039;t be sorry. Many a vendor has a lot to learn from Galindoi. S/He will be missed.
