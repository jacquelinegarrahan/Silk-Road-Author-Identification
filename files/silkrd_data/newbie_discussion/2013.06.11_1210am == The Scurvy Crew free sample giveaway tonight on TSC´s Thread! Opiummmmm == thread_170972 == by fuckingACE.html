				Hey Gang! <br /><br />Its Ace here from TSC (the scurvy crew), we don´t usually venture into this part of the forums very often, which really is wrong of us and from now on we promise to be here more often. Anyway, I´m here to tell you about a drugs sample giveaway were doing tonight! <br />As some of you may already know, ahead of introducing a new range of drugs onto the market, TSC chooses some members to pre-test the products and give their opinions on our forum page! In the past we&#039;ve kept this to senior members only but with the new opiates range we are introducing we thought we would give newbies a go too! <br /><br />First a lil about what we currently stock. We have three sections of available products, they are:<br /><br />Our weekend kits, for those long boring weekends with nothing to do. You got your Weekend trip kit, which is trips and some hash for the comedown, you got your sexy weekend kit for you and your loverrrr to get down and dirty with, its an opium/hash mix and a romantic playlist to go with. Then you got your anti-Hangover weekend kit, which is GHB for the club and your choice of hash for when you get home (on a side note, did you know that GHB is actually really good for you?! It aids in natural HGH production and promotes a restful well balanced sleep cycle), A newcomer is our opium party kit, it contains too many individual items to list, but essentially you can turn your living room into an old school opium den for the weekend! complete with opium tea, Bayer opium, Laudanum and all!<br /><br />Then you have our hash range, which has been disputed in many threads and feedback comments to be some of the highest quality on the road and for good reason! We go to insane lengths to get the stuff, from packing it into UAV´s to old school egg eating in Morocco! We get all the stuff from source (the farms) ourselves and its all as pure as pure can be. Currently in stock we have our Sativa hashish from Ketama Morocco, our jardallah also Morrocan, our Algerian hashish which is a newcomer, one of our customer favorites is our Pakistani pollen plaque! and soon to be introduced is our AK47 hash and Mexican culero. <br /><br />We also sell Andalusian outdoor weed which is one of our TSCrew Members favorites! but more on that later. Oh and I almost forgot our S-Isomer Ketamine straight from India.&nbsp; <br /><br />What makes us famous we think is the quality of our hash and opium! We usually have Bayer opium, (currently out of stock as this years stock is still drying out, and spanish fresh opium, same thing) It will be available late this week early next. What really makes the creme de la creme is the Bayer opium, its got all our signed up members buzzing! literally. So we decided to expand on the idea this year and that&#039;s what the drugs freebies are about!<br />This year when we went into the Bayer pharmaceutical camps to rob them of their yummy opium, we not only did that, but based on the success of our opium last year we robbed them of most of their field. yup we drove a truck in there at midnight when we saw the guards leave (lazy bastards) took out the strimmers and took as many whole poppy plants as we could in 6 hours. normally our opium collection is a quiet affair, no lights, creeping around in the dark slicing up poppies and collecting the latex without even whispering, well the beginning of it was this year too, but we decided to take things a step further in the name of you silk roaders. <br />Sooo we were left with a hell of a lot of kilos of fresh Bayer poppies stems roots and even a rabbit, for those of you who are not familiar, Bayer poppies are GM modified poppies to contain on average 25% more of certain active alcaloids (including morphine) than any other poppy, that makes them very special and very hard to get... Thanks Bayer co. ! <br /><br />We then started experimenting with different types of things we could offer with the poppies and came up with the following list!<br /><br />Bayer opium Tea listings<br />Bayer pod putty <br />Bayer Laudanum<br />Bayer seeds<br />bayer poppy straw<br />Bayer poppy heads<br />Refined or cooked Bayer opium <br />and of course our regular Bayer opium and Spanish fresh opium. <br /><br />Slowly were getting all the listings up and the methods perfected but now were in a position to offer samples of almost all of the above in exchange for reviews! As I said its what we usually do before the big introduction of a new range we plan to offer! <br /><br />SO head over to our review thread and say hello for your chance to win yourself a free sample. I´ll select the members who make me giggle the most and of course those who sign up to be TSCrewbies (TSCrew Members) by joining our official members only club get preference, its totally free to join, you just need to send a tormail to TSCREW@tormail.org with your SR username. This enables us to keep track of your purchaces so you can earn points with us, also you are the first selected for our competitions, regular giveaways, monthly news letter, annnnnnnd your the only ones entitled to our premiere listings and our regular reduced price listings! Also there&#039;s the added bonus that if SR ever goes down we can keep in touch!!<br /><br />Soooooooo head on over gang! http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94723.0<br /><br />ACE<br />
