				Alexander Shulgin is pretty much the chemist that made all the best psychedelic drugs out there.<br />MDMA became popular thanks to him. And many other compounds.<br />He&#039;s old, and needs help. Many people on Silk Road have used his compounds to expand their mind.<br />Many people on Silk Road got an income thanks to his work.<br />I&#039;m not begging you for money. I&#039;m asking you to support a genius that made all our lives better.<br />Send some spare money to him on 4/20. Take a few less drugs and help the man who made your experiences possible.<br />He really needs it for his medical care. DPR as well should help Shulgin IMO.<br />He&#039;s just too much of a great man.<br /><br />If you&#039;re an MDMA or a psychedelic vendor, consider sending part of your drug income to him. He&#039;s the one that made it possible.<br />Keep spreadin&#039; the karma. Thanks.

				if you ever consulted erowid about virtually all hallucinogens, empathogens, entheogens, (or more specifically tryptamines and phenethylamines) then you have benefited from his research. it takes a certain dedication to your work to not only explore the different variations of chemicals that can be produced, but to actually test them on yourself without knowing what the final effects could be, just to document the ways in which these substances interact with our perception of reality. he is without doubt the greatest hero of the psychonaut. <br /><br />it may also surprise you that he actually worked *for* the DEA, which allowed him to run his own analytical laboratory to create and test psychedelic drugs, until the narcs got pissed and raided him in the 90s. in the last decade he&#039;s undergone a lot of health issues, and his wife has to sell off their property to pay for his medical costs. <br /><br />more information (clearnet): http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/donate/<br /><br />edit:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I wonder if they&#039;d accept bitcoins</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>shulgin&#039;s website doesn&#039;t, but the shulgin archival project at erowid seems to (i haven&#039;t verified it but i did see the bitcoin logo among the other payment logos)

				Hey,<br />I do not think the Shulgins currently accept bitcoin donations.<br />However, I&#039;m quite sure that if you ask Erowid Center they can send your money from BTC to the shulgins via cash.<br />If you feel safe enough to use traditional payment methods, check out Shulgin Institute&#039;s donation page. It should be just a google search away (or, if you don&#039;t trust google, it&#039;s on Erowid).<br /><br />

				bumping for great justice.<br /><br />think of how much good you can do if, instead of spamming this forum with your bullshit so that you are allowed to go spam the other forums with even more bullshit, you gave $5 to the Shulgins.

				there really should be some kind of algorithm to negate spam posts so that they don&#039;t count towards the 50, but nothing i can think of would be foolproof. <br /><br />also bump.
