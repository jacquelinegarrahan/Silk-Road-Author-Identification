				I already posted this in the Avengers thread, but its always nice to have content besides &quot;spam to 50&quot; posts in the newbie section.<br /><br />** Haizenberg LSD Review. **<br /><br />I am very satisfied with Haizenberg.<br /><br />Shipping to Midwest USA from The Czech Republic took 13 days.<br />I tried his product last Friday, the same day I received it.<br /><br />His product is very good, I ate a five-strip and had a very insightful trip.<br /><br />I ordered 15 hits of his Gandalf blotter, I decided to test it out with five hits.<br />I held the five-strip between my lip and gum for about 40 minutes until I finally swallowed it, there was no taste to speak of.<br />The come up started after about 20 mins, I peaked at about T+ 1:30 and that lasted for awhile.. I would like to be more specific about the duration, but time is just one of those things that stops mattering when your in the middle of a good trip.<br /><br />Haizenberg&#039;s acid feels very clean, with no notable body-load. I was very clear-headed with OEV including kaleidoscopes of color and tracers, color was greatly enhanced. The trip was separated into two distinct halves for me. The first part very introspective and visual, the second part euphoric and outgoing. Its quality acid. I havent had any this good since we got a couple sheets of WoW unperf from Colorado 2 years back, that was awesome LSD! And Haizenberg&#039;s LSD is awesome!<br /><br />Haizenberg&#039;s communication was quick. But I ordered 10 hits and another 5 hits at the same time, I sent him a message requesting they be combined into one envelope, he replied promptly in the affirmative but when the LSD arrived it was in two separate pieces of mail. Meh... not relly a big deal to me, I understand that Haizenberg is moving a large volume of mail, its a lot to keep up with. I&#039;m just happy he took the time to read my message and respond to it, and impressed that he was very quick about getting the LSD into the mail.<br /><br />The packaging.. not much to say about the packaging. The stealth is good enough, it got here, but it is immediately obvious where the LSD is once you open the mail and take out its contents.<br /><br /><br />*Trip Report*<br /><br />The first part of the trip was difficult, I am not in a good place in my life right now so when I became introspective I had several unpleasant personal issues that the acid forced me to think about and deal with. The good news is the acid also allowed me to look at my life from a different perspective and resolve my internal conflicts, I have been much happier this week than I have for some time. I realized I was depressed and had let my apartment and appearance fall into shambles, my apt was a perfect representation of my mind-Dirty and cluttered.. I got a start on cleaning my apt while I was peaking, a week later I am well groomed, and my apt is clean as is my mind. There were lots of visuals, the flies had looong streaks of tracers behind them.<br /><br />During the second part of the trip my apt became too overwhelming for me, that&#039;s when I ran into the neighbor kid. We climbed on top of our apt building and monkeyed around on the roof for a bit, then we climbed down and went to a nearby bar. We sit at the bar, I&#039;m not digging the vibe in the bar, it seemed like everyone was there to eat and just socialize within their own little groups. I convince my neighbor to walk downtown with me so we can do some &quot;urban exploration&quot; I.E. find an even taller building to sneak onto the roof. My neighbor bailed on me when faced with locked doors I climbed on top of the elevator to access maintenance hallways that I supposed would lead to the roof. No longer having an accomplice I felt disinclined to continue my exploration of the high-rise I was in, I exited the building and began walking around downtown aimlessly just soaking up the sights, everything was beautiful. An actual friend called me(not just an acquaintance like my neighbor) and invited me down to a club he and his wife were at, I walk back to my car and drive to the club. I stayed at the club for several hours drinking, socializing, and people-watching until my friend said he was leaving at which time I had him lead me to my apt in his car(There were lots of police lights and people downtown, it was all very disorienting, I felt it best if I just concentrated on driving behind my friend instead of trying to forge my own way.). I got back to my apt, popped some benzos, smoked some weed, and went to bed. Woke up the next day and continued improving my life. I had a blast, I love to urban explore but I almost never do it, I&#039;m glad I took a break and did it. Everything was just so great.<br /><br />It was an awesome day! And I appreciate Haizenberg facilitating that, I will be purchasing from him again.

				I ordered ten of Haizenberg&#039;s Hoffmann blotters in May. Haizenberg accidentally sent me five. However he offered to make up for his mistake by sending me a bonus of five extra blotters. I tried one of these blotters last Saturday during a dub party. I&nbsp; am a fairly experienced LSD user and had my share of good acid in the nineties. The strongest were so-called purple dots with 600 ug of acid in them. Nowadays I don&#039;t like to trip that strong anymore. Between 100 and 200 ug is strong enough for me. Based on my experience I think I can say that Haizenberg&#039;s blotters do contain the amount advertised. I had a trip that lasted about ten hours with enhanced sensitivity to light, a nice body load and strong insights. Furthermore, what I like about this vendor is that he is co-operative and remains in contact. Keep up the good work.

				Haizenbergs LSD is some triple A class shit for real. Tripe A for Amazingly Awesome Acid is what it is.&nbsp; This stuff tore holes in my reality like it was the matrix in 1999 or something. Man I&#039;m still picking the pieces up from this one.&nbsp; CAUTION: May be missing some time/space fabric. wait, there it is. found it.. Anyways this trip has been one hell of a ride, a very clean ride though. It has has amazingly smooth transitions between coming up, rushing and peaking and then coming down and chilling out, and now... And now writing this damn it.<br />As I said I recommend it very much. In the beginning Lucy whispered with the subtlety the precision of a ninja, then she roared with almighty fury and sang with the sacred tongue of the gods. She certainly blessed me with her beauty once again. And Oh, has it been so long since I witnessed the cosmic dance.&nbsp; The whole universe unraveled around me while I maintained perfect clarity for what seemed like an eternity. Lucy was like an old friend or a lover reunited, lets just say she holds a special place in my heart. We have danced in the sky many times, her an I. Tonight brought back some fond memories of the good old days. The days I hold so close to my heart.<br />Ok so, to recap. Trip was awesome. Still feeling good in my space cadet glow. Time to chill out, smoke some weed and relax knowing that sometimes, for somebody, somewhere out there the universe and the stars may align for a brief moment.<br />Thanks Again Haizenberg&nbsp; AAA+<br />LOVE that shit.<br /><br />peace and love to everyone on the road<br />stay safe and stay free..<br />Fuck the police and anybody who tries to take your freedom&gt;<br />Thanks to DPR and crew, for making this dream come true.<br />BuRnTHefLag!!!&nbsp;

				:) Yay, a relevant thread I can post in before reaching goddamn 50 newbie-posts!<br /><br />Preparing for a festival, I ordered 10 Hofmann blotters from Haizenberg, at a very reasonable price. They were advertised at 100 µg. I ordered from Scandinavia.<br />He sent me a message ~5 days after shipment, asking very politely if it would be OK with me to finalize now due to the high BTC volatility - normally I&#039;m adverse to FE, but since it was a small transaction, he has a good track record on SR and didn&#039;t trigger my scammer-radar at any point, I had no problem with FE. <br />The shipment arrived the day after, with really good stealth - I have a hard time imagining this being intercepted at any point. So, less than a week to reach Scandinavia. <br />I have a fair share of experience with LSD in different amounts, forms and purities, also with 100 µg pure substance measured off as accurately as possible. I and the rest of the &quot;tasting party&quot; agreed that this seemed like good, nice LSD just around 100 µg per blotter. <br />Excellent service, shipment, communications and I like to receive psychedelics and other drugs of the strength I expect. It&#039;s no fun to find out - especially with acid in the middle of a chaotic party - that the dose you&#039;ve taken was just too little or way too strong.<br />In conclusion, my best recommendations to this vendor. Honest guy, good product. I expect to be a returning customer.

				I&#039;m about to order 25 hits from Haizenberg, I expect it to be everything I have come to expect from this vendor...&nbsp; Top quality.<br /><br />Will report back after our transaction is concluded.<br /><br /><br />@ReggieHadHeart- Thank you for the positive vibes my way. That&#039;s just the way life goes sometimes. I&#039;ve got a kid on the way, I can barely take care of myself much less another person, I&#039;m bummed about that. Good news is I just started working for a new, larger company with all the pluses that entails. I keep trying to run away from my responsibilities with all sorts of self-destructive acts, drugs and sex mainly(Lucy doesn&#039;t count), but the LSD genuinely puts me in a better place for about two weeks after a good trip, I become happier and less self-destructive. Thank god for quality acid.

				Hope it&#039;s not too off-topic, but I wanted a real post too... How do those compare to Machine Maid&#039;s Orange Sunshine? I have 2 that I&#039;m taking tomorrow afternoon or the next, and I was hoping to maybe compare results... Or just increase my curiosity in this delightful subject.

				Has anyone ordered from Heizenberg lately? My order was put in transit more than 10 days ago, and like the damned fool I am I FE&#039;d. It doesn&#039;t really matter if it takes a while, I don&#039;t really have the time to be tripping much these days anyway (and I got another shipment from someone else since, enough to keep me busy this weekend :) ). But I really hope it comes eventually.

				Heizenbergs blotters came two weeks ago, great stealth and a nice bonus to compensate for the slow delivery time. I&#039;ve tripped on them twice, had a wonderful time and so did my friends.
