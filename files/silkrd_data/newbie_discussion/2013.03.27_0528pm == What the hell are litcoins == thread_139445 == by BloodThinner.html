				@Akathisia <br /><br />your so correct but what would be the point since the system they put into place with tying it to the $$$ would be the same and the fluctuation up and down from Litcoin to dollar and what people charge in their &quot;market&quot; would fluctuate most likely the same, they are quite dumb IMHO seeing how the Bitcoin will ultimately win in the end imo.. your so correct though <br />Akathisia

				No Idea, Ill break out the Reefer and think about this.<br /><br />Thought about it, bearing in mind I am baked here&#039;s what I think.<br /><br />I think that the DEA and all the other killjoy&#039;s, especially Banks, are trying to create a multitude of Bitcoin rivals to try and get the masses to stop buying into it. <br /><br />Its not to far fetched to imagine them using saturation of&nbsp; market to create distrust and fear, Banks fund Government&#039;s and they need to develop Bitcoin competition to garner a public outcry so they can set out&nbsp; to destroy the power of the Bitcoin by making up Bullshit laws to stop online currency that is not the Government&#039;s but the peoples ,&nbsp; Oh FUCK Im in the DEEP what if mental drawer here lol <br />Fuck It, Time to put on a bit of Ride of the Valkry on and relax<br /><br />Peace&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				LITECOINS ARE GREAT!&nbsp; Check www.btc-e.com for example. you can shift instant between your bitcoins and litecoins! so when bitcoins is behaving strange you can simply switch to litecoins! I personally do 50/50 <br />by the way litecoins you can use on ATLANTIS!!!

				those coins have been being mined for a year or so, i think the reason they are trying to get them&nbsp; going is because some people have shitloads of them and would love to see them rise to 1/4 of btc, last year they were dirt cheap,

				Litecoins come from bitcoins. It&#039;s a cheaper alternative to the expensive bitcoins who&#039;s owners bought them up when they were just pennies! Giving a chance for newbs to enjoy and create more awareness and popularity of the crypto currency.

				if you want to see what bitcoins are doing in real time check this link:<br />www.bitcoinity.org/markets<br />it is the best visual graph i have found.<br />my opinion, for what it&#039;s worth, i think a distinct effort is being made by (????) to set &amp; control the value of BC.<br />the current change in value during the past 4 weeks is being established by entities that are not using BC in exchange for goods or services. <br />

				Bitcoins have withstood the test of 2 years in open market.<br /><br />Litcoins sounds like a ripoff.&nbsp; Be very careful.
