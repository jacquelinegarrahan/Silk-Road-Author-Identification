				Let me preface my complaint by stating the the fact that supersun&#039;s service in the past has been nearly impeccable--however, this week I&#039;ve been having a terrible, frustrating time trying to reach supersun. I placed my order on Wednesday morning, and it was marked in transit less than an hour later (wonderful, I thought); I checked the mailbox on Friday hopefully, but it wasn&#039;t there (no big deal, it&#039;s priority mail after all). Saturday came and went with no mail to speak of, and when I messaged supersun I received no response, although he did read it. He behaved the same way when I sent another message conveying my worries and frustration. Now, it&#039;s Monday and still no package or explanation, and it&#039;s not looking good. What do I do? I feel helpless because he won&#039;t even give me the courtesy of a single-word response! I&#039;m so frustrated, and I need input.

				Last Saturday 6/22, I ordered the sample from Supersun. I told him about a thief I had living at home so I bought prime with tracking which I did not receive. Monday came and another order I placed Saturday arrived. I usually get stuff in two days. I asked supersun for that tracking number and if my product had arrived. He never answered one email except to tell me he waived his customers right to sign which I appreciated. I got paranoid that I was robbed and new I would loose in arbitration because I had confessed about the thief and I was afraid he would attack me using his reputation, so I finalized. Well my thief proved to me that he didn&#039;t take anything unless I ordered pain pills. So I am changing my review and will let my buyers stats speak for myself.

				I&#039;ve ordered from supersun and i&#039;ve never had an issue with his product in the past. However, he never answers or replies to messages I send him, which is kind of annoying.. But the product always gets to me when i&#039;ve ordered from him. Maybe try taking the issue to the resolution center, if supersun suppposedly has a tracking number, he shud be able to prove to SR that it arrived at your house. If he cant prove that it got to you, maybe you are elgible for a refund. See what the SR resolution center says.

				This guy never and I mean never answers messages that are PGP encrypted. I don&#039;t know what his problem is, I was looking for quantity.

				I really can&#039;t do business with somebody who won&#039;t communicate, no matter how good the wares allegedly are.<br /><br />Why read the incoming messages if you&#039;re not going to bother to respond?<br /><br />Also, old threads indicate the vendor was a great communicator - maybe he sold his account?
