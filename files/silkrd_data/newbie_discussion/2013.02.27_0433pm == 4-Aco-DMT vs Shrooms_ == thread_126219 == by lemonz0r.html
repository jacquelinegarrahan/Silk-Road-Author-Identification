				I&#039;ve tripped mushrooms once before (2.4g dried cubensis) and really enjoyed it. I&#039;d like to do it again soon-ish, with an increased dose.<br /><br />Then I heard lots of people say 4-aco-DMT produces a very very similar trip, and it&#039;s cheaper! So, I had a couple of questions:<br />First, for people who&#039;ve tripped on both, how do you think they compare?<br />Secondly, what kind of dose of 4-aco-DMT should I be looking at taking now? Hopefully something that would be roughly equivalent to a 3.25g shroom trip.<br /><br />Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

				I&#039;ve been told they&#039;re almost identical<br />Well you should probably take 15-20mg<br />read up on erowid

				Intrigued by 4-Aco DMT have any users experienced much body load off it?<br />The main thing that puts me off shrooms is the fact that I am almost always sick after taking them even at low doses.

				I haven&#039;t had a chance to try Shrooms yet, but I&#039;ve had a few goes at 4-Aco. My experience was that it had an intense body high, gave me a mild case of the tryptamine stupids but was very low anxiety and mellow. It wasn&#039;t especially visual for me, at least not around 20-25mg. Not particularly insightful or &quot;deep&quot; in my experience, but ideal for watching AdultSwim. It did make shit really funny. For my wife it was intensely visual and had a fractal complexity not unlike LSD, but only in a natural environment.<br /><br />Most people will say that Shrooms are a deeper, more spiritual/intellectual experience than 4-Aco, but I couldn&#039;t say one way or the other.<br /><br />One word to the wise, store it in an amber vial away from heat and especially moisture. The shit degrades if you look at it funny.<br /><br />dngdwn: I get nauseous from tryptamines generally, but 4-Aco only every gives me a mild bit of it during the come up. A little weed usually tamps it right down.

				I have done both, I like shrooms a lot more.&nbsp; They do produce a similar effect but it feels all chemical or something. Shrooms just have a really peaceful earthy effect on me that 4 act dmt does not have. Just trip less on better stuff :]<br /><br />
