				&nbsp; Ok I finally got my $. I plan on going to bitinstant.com... If I don&#039;t have a printer will I still be able to pay cash at a payment center? I don&#039;t have any other way to pay except $.<br />&nbsp; And where do I have the BTC&#039;s sent to? I mean like a wallet, then here? Or just here?&nbsp; &nbsp;How do I get a wallet? And if I send them to my SR account, how do I do that?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And where do I get a wallet, if I want to have one then send the BTC&quot;s to my SR account in increments?<br />&nbsp; Anything else that you think I might need to know would also be appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll figure most of it out once I go to bitinstant... Also do I need anything before I do the bitinstant?&nbsp; I&#039;ll wait for a reply b4 I do it.

				I think you need to print something out to use BitInstant.&nbsp; &nbsp;But can&#039;t you do that at your local Kinko&#039;s copy place or your public library??&nbsp; I think they let you print stuff for a price per page.&nbsp; Get a wallet at Blockchain.info.&nbsp; You would be smart to encrypt your wallet and create an alias for your wallet so you don&#039;t have to remember the long name for your wallet they give you otherwise.&nbsp; If you encrypt your wallet, don&#039;t forget the passcode whatever you do.&nbsp; &nbsp;if you lose either the name and/or alias to your blockchain wallet or the encryption passcode, there is no way to get your bitcoins.&nbsp; No way at all.&nbsp; Trust me on that.&nbsp; It&#039;s happened to me.&nbsp; Kicked myself for that one.&nbsp; Luckily wasn&#039;t too much money.&nbsp; I think that one your bitcoins are available from bitinstant they send you an email and that&#039;s when you tell them what wallet address you want to transfer them too.&nbsp; Search the forums for a lot more detailed info on all this stuff.&nbsp; This question has been answered thousands of times in the forums.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;I don&#039;t understand what I need a wwallet for? Can&#039;t they just be sent to my email then I email them here? And what do I send them to to get them on my account?

				no you cant do that simpy by using email, and i wouldnt suggest bitinstant right now but feel free to experiment. if you have a bank account i suggest using dwolla to campbx, while youll find many complaints about cbx it worked flawlessly as far as the bitcoin transfering..&nbsp;
