				Hey y&#039;all,<br /><br />So, that whole &quot;FOX Scale&quot; thing got out of hand. I said some nasty things to people... I apologize. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m some &quot;HOLY JUNKIE&quot; who can judge dope through astral projection. I just was frustrated over the conflicting reviews and was hoping that the idea would catch on in part at least...<br /><br />I was not looking for a hand-out. I am not better than anyone. I said some shitty things.<br /><br />I was, and always am, high. I had good intentions... but, ended up looking like shit.<br /><br />I apologize.<br /><br />Peace&amp;Love,<br />~f.xy
