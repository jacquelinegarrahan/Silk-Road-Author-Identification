				It makes perfect sense if you are trying to infiltrate Silk Road...<br /><br />you pose as a vendor to get as many real names and addresses as possible...and then steer them to a website off of tor...which means you instantly snag their physical IP address...<br /><br />At that point it is a simple matter to connect the dots...in order to log into tor you must go through your local IP...if someone already knows the name of the user and their local IP ...they can force the ISP to give them all the records of when that user has accessed tor...<br /><br />They could even install a keystroke worm on your computer and get your SR usernames...passwords...transactions...etc...<br /><br />EXTREME CAUTION...THIS DOES NOT PASS THE SMELL TEST...<br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t really understand the threat here? Is the link to a random clearnet site or a site that his owned by the vendor? Because even if i was on tor browser and then i went to a link on clearnet in another browser they wouldn&#039;t be able to link the two?<br /><br />The only way i can see this working is if the link was to a site owned by the vendor and upon sending the guide the vendor altered the link so it passed a unique value. So then the vendor could link an IP to a customer because they would know which customer they gave the link with that value too. I cant see any other way this could be done.<br /><br />If its just the same link in every document the vendor may be able to get all the IP address&#039;s that had visited that link but would then struggle to connect these to a specific buyer. Plus as its a clearnet link the site is probably searchable meaning that loads of random people would probably visit the site as well making it even harder. Or someone could just post the link and get everyone to click on it again saturating the list of IP&#039;s<br /><br />With regards to peoples names an address&#039;s, This vendor shouldn&#039;t have these details as they are providing a digital guide which doesn&#039;t require them!<br />

				@Luvs...<br /><br />The link is when she knows your name...since she asked or it on the order form for the guide...and then she finds out your IP address...since she steers you to a clearnet site to download the guide...AND SPECIFICALLY TELLS YOU NOT TO USE TOR TO ACCESS THE DOWNLOAD SITE...<br /><br />Now she knows your name...and she knows your physical IP address...and so it is a simple matter for LE to go to your ISP and say give us the records or this guy...evidence being that he ordered an item (her guide) off Silk Road...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper...<br /><br />PS: Yes she has no need whatsoever for your name and address...she is purportedly offering you a free download...<br /><br />FISHY FISHY FISHY...

If its a site on the clearnet it could be anyone accessing that link even someone that may have just stumbled across it. Unless the link was different for every customer and had some kind of unique identifier this just wouldn&#039;t work!<br /><br />Like i say, once given the link it could just be posted in any forum and have it saturated with hits in no time!

				I would be careful calling a vendor law enforcement until more facts that would support that came out. You do not want to be responsible for ruining someones reputation because you jumped the gun. Who knows, maybe she is making vendors guides to sell and was going to supply the buyers guides for free?

But even then its not an easy process and i can assure you this from experience with 4 years working for a major ISP<br /><br />I think the possibility of some kind cyber crime to be more likely! This would explain why it had to be through clearnet because it could be an attack that utilizes the methods that the tor browser disables!<br /><br />or..... She could just be a nice person who paid to hand out free guides or like some one else has also said the free guides could just be a beginning for this vendor whilst she sets up propper shop!

				why would LE even waste their time chasing newbie bitcoin buyers so they can seize a couple of grams on their first purchase? That doesn&#039;t make any sense!

				Luvs...once again I don&#039;t follow your logic...<br /><br />Sure some of the more cautious among us will not give out our real name and address...just to get a link to a free bitcoin guide...but some will...statistically proven...<br /><br />And then what...here is where I don&#039;t follow you...she has snagged a few dozen takers so far...so these are folks who have gone to her SR store...given a name and address (maybe real maybe fake)...and then gone on to her url and downloaded her guide...<br /><br />Again some of these may have used their better judgement and ignored her instructions to not use tor...but that still leaves several hapless individuals who have probably given their real names and addresses...and who have used clearnet to access her site...now how many IP addresses does she have...a few legit ones at most...<br /><br />how hard is it to match these up to the legit names...and addresses...remember she has your address...i your IP is geographically close to your address its a match...<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how this is so hard...<br /><br />Some people are using the word paranoia...but they seem to forget that we have a war on drugs that has over 1 million goons in uniform and spends who knows who many billion dollars a year...<br /><br />The drug war uses a two-prong strategy...going after both users and sellers...if LE is having a hard time cracking into Silk Road...don&#039;t you think they are going to try to go after buyers...?<br /><br />What better way tan to target newbies...?...<br /><br />Asking for name and address...?...puhleeze...for a url to download a guide...? ...puhleeze...telling you not to use tor when downloading the guide...?...puhleeze...<br /><br />This is a LE operation no question....can anyone be so naive that there are not right at this very moment several dozen LEOs logged into this site...<br /><br />Quite honestly I have to think the ones that are defending this quite transparent scam are suspect themselves...

				Where do you guys get the idea that LE doesn&#039;t go after the small fry...?<br /><br />Get caught with a 40 rock in your pocket and you&#039;re going to jail for a good long time...<br /><br />Like I said...they are probably not making much headway cracking the SR technology and getting a way into the inner circle...<br /><br />Logically then they need to nibble at the edges...<br /><br />Once they have a buyer&#039;s real name...and your real IP address...they don&#039;t have to have the drug dog at the post office every day...they get a simple legal order for your ISP to intercept all your internet communications....everytime you log on tor...they know it...there;&#039;s a good chance you have made a buy...and they can have that mail set aside for a few days or weeks...<br /><br />They come in one morning with the dog and check all that stacked up mail...bingo...<br /><br />Once they have the goods they also have a lead on the seller...they know his postal code...they are chipping away...<br /><br />but the real point of a program like this could be months in the making...they want to assemble a database of SR buyers and their real names...addresses...and IPs...<br /><br />Then they go in on one fell swoop and bust several dozen SR buyers...hundreds maybe...maybe enough to disrupt the operation...can&#039;t have sellers without buyers...

				Has anyone ever purchase digital goods from SR before. I have had a multitude of download links and different methods of delivery. All of them have been similar to what this vendor is doing. Except that she is asking for name and address. And that was not even on the listing page? Only on her profile?

				Look Llama...<br /><br />I know the address and name is obviously required when the vendor is actually SENDING you something in the mail...but why does she choose this method when all she is sending you is an email with a url...?<br /><br />It makes no sense...<br /><br />Also why is she instructing people to download her guide outside of tor...?<br /><br />Again there is no logical explanation...?<br /><br />And the kicker...why does she put up a $500 bond in order to give away free text material that can be posted on the site free of charge...<br /><br />If she wants to solicit donations...she can set up a donation jar like others...<br /><br />I certainly have not changed my suspicions about the way this person is operating...<br /><br />I also certainly am quite sure that there are plenty of LE people right here participating in these forums...yourself perhaps...?<br /><br />I am not concerned in the least about the reputation of a person whos actions are very suspicious to say the least...<br /><br />I am more concerned about those unsuspecting newbies who are going to end up on a police database with their name...address...and IP...and perhaps a legal order for their ISP to set up a VPN to channel all their communications directly to LE...<br /><br />And one last question...?...why exactly are you so concerned and sympathetic to a person that you supposedly do not know...and whose product you supposedly do not know...?

				Where did you learn your debating manners...a barnyard...?<br /><br />You think it is okay to&nbsp; insult people and call them names...?...that&#039;s called an ad hominem attack and is what the loser of a debate resorts to when he is unable to win with facts and logic...<br /><br />And speaking of facts and logic...what you just offered is pure bs...the idea that she is planning to at some later date actually sell something is pure supposition...did you perhaps consult your crystal ball on that one...?<br /><br />opening a vendor account to give away a free url link via email...looks more like a way to collect names and addresses than anything resembling a business plan...<br /><br />That&#039;s the only logical reason...knowing that the way the site is set up...she can harvest those names and addresses without actually selling anything that could not go through email or be posted here on the site...<br /><br />As for building up a reputation... I have seen several new vendors here in the short while I have been here...and they act logically...they go on the forums and they announce their plan to sell such and such and they offer lots of free samples to qualified reviewers who already buy those products...that&#039;s how this is done...<br /><br />And your explanation...maybe she is telling people not to use tor to access her download site because the poor soul mistakenly thinks it might not work...oh dear...I could stoop to some pretty creative insults here too...but that&#039;s not my game...<br /><br />Vendors have the responsibility to conduct business in a safe manner...there are tons of resources here and saying &quot;I didn&#039;t know&quot; is not a valid excuse when it comes to doing business in an unsafe way this place...<br /><br />Funny how you don&#039;t deny being law enforcement...also worth noting that if an LE agent wanted to vend here...they would have to give stuff away or free...since selling on an illegal site is against the law...<br /><br />Now wonder the call you the LAME Llama...<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve read through the guide and it seems fine to me...&nbsp; It didn&#039;t throw any red flags in my mind, and the PDF seems clean on my system.<br /><br />I&#039;m still new to all this, but SR asks for Name and Address for every purchase right?&nbsp; Just put in &quot;Thank You&quot; or something similar.&nbsp; It was a little odd that I was asked to download on clearnet, but it downloaded fine through Tor, but I always keep my connection private and secure even while browsing clearnet for other reasons.<br /><br />Even if this was some elaborate LE operation, there would be no way to prove anything...&nbsp; So you downloaded a .pdf document on how to securely buy BTC, who cares?&nbsp; There would be no way to link it to your account on SR, or see other purchases on your account, or get your mailing address provided you didn&#039;t supply it.<br /><br />I just figured it was a new vendor on the road trying to build up their stats before they went on to sell some items.

I know kind people like this who don&#039;t have to be rich to do something helpful, but obviously in your World there are none, this is as sad as your inability to accept the count less people that have explained over and over again all the possible reasons things looked the way they do.

				Topshelf,<br /><br />Have you ever received digital goods off of SR before. There are quite a few vendors that direct you to clearnet websites to download your item. I mean I have downloaded like 10 different things that way. I do not see what the issue is.

				Topper,<br /><br />I think you are properly suspicious.&nbsp; This is serious business and suspicious should be the default condition.<br /><br />If the guides are so good, then why not just post them to this forum.&nbsp; I suppose her argument might be that some folks go to SR but not this forum.&nbsp; Someone interested only in education for the community should post here.&nbsp; Maybe she is raising her stats for a future sales opportunities.&nbsp; That seems to be the only reasonable explanation other than a LE connection.<br /><br />Are these clearnet URLs serialized?&nbsp; That would be a dead LE giveaway and would make each URL directly traceable to the SR order.&nbsp; If it is just a static URL then why have people place an order just to get it.&nbsp; She explains that the guide changes but you can change the guide without changing the URL.&nbsp; Just put a date or version number on it.<br /><br />I think you are right to be suspicious.

				Snowflake you should take security more seriously.<br /><br />However its a clean file, exactly as described. <br /><br />For the paranoid among you:<br /><br />1.Get a USB<br />2.Download a version of Linux live to USB<br />3.Shutdown computer and boot Linux from Bios<br />3.Select the temporary OS (live)<br />4.Open Firefox and Download Tor.<br />5.Download the PDF through TOR<br />6.Open Pdf whilst disconnected from the internet.<br /><br />Its a very helpful review which is free because its for people who don&#039;t have bitcoin.

Building up stats, testing whether folks are interested in downloading well-written information. It&#039;s clear they&#039;ll buy pot, etc., but I wanted to see if they value the time it takes someone to wade through confusing information and compile it in a simple and easy-to-read manner, informed by a lot of experience, trial and error.<br /><br />I started with a BTC guide since that&#039;s the first and most obvious hurdle on the Road. It&#039;s free because I can&#039;t charge folks bitcoins for a guide on obtaining bitcoins.<br /><br />I *can* charge for other services, and will do so in the future, provided I can make a reasonable profit with a minimum of hassle.<br /><br />I enjoy the idea of earning a living without breaking a single law. But this sure doesn&#039;t make me LE. I support this community and am proud to be part of it. <br /><br />I in no way fault anyone, anytime, for being suspicious. The feedback I received--from folks who downloaded my guide--helped me streamline my process and make it more and more clear. Feedback on the forum is quite a bit harder to track, but I&#039;m doing what I can.<br /><br />And this, roadsters, is my 50th post!<br /><br />Peace,<br />MW

				MW,<br /><br />Are your clearnet URLs serialized?&nbsp; Do you issue a unique URL for each order?<br /><br />If so, an investigator with access to your information could tie the IP address to an actual order placed on SR.&nbsp; This is not a crime but might be enough to start an investigation of the activity at that IP.

				Thanks for clarifying that.&nbsp; <br /><br />But link shorteners could also be used in the same way as a serialized URL.&nbsp; The only real test would be to &quot;buy&quot; your guide from multiple accounts and see if the shortened URLs are indeed the same for all &quot;purchasers&quot;.<br /><br />The real problem I see that I think Topper saw too was that your methods are fraught with risk but aimed at noobs who wouldn&#039;t be able to assess or even be aware of the risk.&nbsp; In fact there are users on this thread that don&#039;t understand the risk of downloading in the clearnet.<br /><br />The sad fact is that you can&#039;t prove you are not LE.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to prove a negative.&nbsp; But you could allay all suspicions by selling drugs.&nbsp; Ironic, eh.

I thought since the guide contains nothing illegal, there&#039;s no reason to call attention to it by accessing it via Tor, so I advised downloading the guide via the Clearnet.

And I agree with your ironic assessment: I cannot prove a negative. I can ironically only become legit on this site by breaking the law!&nbsp; Being a good citizen, by offering free and helpful material, has only aroused suspicion. <br /><br />Hopefully, the newbs who have been helped out by my guide will say more in their feedback about how it helped them, and my original mission of helping folks along a rocky path will be fulfilled.

				TJ...you make some good technical points about which I was not aware....not being a computer guy so to speak...<br /><br />I think you also made a good point about medicinewoman laying all suspicions to rest by selling drugs...which would prove she is not LE...<br /><br />but analyze carefully her answer...she does not want to sell drugs because she is a &quot;good citizen...&quot;...which implies that selling drugs makes you a bad citizen...this is exactly the mindframe of law enforcement...<br /><br />This is important to note since the prevailing mindframe and culture of this place is libertarian...anarchist... and anti-state...which are legitimate political beliefs...especially in this day and age of the state becoming ever more tyrannical...financial power concentrated in the hands of a tiny few oligarchs etc...<br /><br />So I would ask Medicinewoman what exactly is a &quot;Good Citizen&quot; like herself doing in a place like this...?...she would be much more at home on facebook...<br /><br />In fact we must take notice that medicinewoman is not selling anything at all...she is giving away a product and only asking for a donation...this too says &quot;beware law enforcement&quot;...because even selling something legal...on an illegal website is an actual criminal act...and since LE are not allowed to commit criminal acts...they choose to give away the product for free...and can still be a vendor here...and try to dig deeper into the workings of this place...<br /><br />Yesterday I spent nearly an hour going through all the listings in the digital products category...and found only one other listing that was being given away for free...this was a hacking book and I should have made a note of the url...<br /><br />I think the moderators should take note of these vendors who charge no price...and think about the possibility that this is in keeping with the rules that law enforcement goes by...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper...

				I think people should be less paranoid of LE and more paranoid of hackers. LE doesn&#039;t get much benefit out of a few IP addresses. Good luck trying to get a search warrant because someone visited your website. The bigger fear is hackers. Someone gets a worm into your computer, nabs passwords to your BTC accounts and empties them out. They make off with hundres-thousands-hundreds of thousands and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. LE wants to shut down venders, hackers want to wrangle in sucker buyers.

				This thread is friggen hilarious!!! I started reading it and I thought wow this Topshelf guy is out to lunch LOLOLOL he is super paranoid and is convinced the CIA is tapping his phones and watching him through his tv. HAHA . I could only read like 1 or 2 pages and then I said fuck me 5 pages!! there is no way this moron still thinks she is LE after 5 pages, no way cant be. I almost fell off my chair sure enough this guy is still convinced.<br /><br />There is so much bulk dealing going on here by big time dealers to even think for one second that LE would spend all that time and resources on newbies that dont even know what a bitcoin is and havent even made a purchase yet and might not even go thru with it is&nbsp; Fuckin ludicrous!!!!! <br /><br />you either have no common sense or just stupid stubborn and would never admit you put you foot in your mouth before thinking. (to do this IRL is understandable we all do it but you gotta be a real idiot to do this online on a forum where you can edit and retract your statement or at least have time to think of a good comeback or excuse for the screwup)<br />sorry for the harshness I dont know why Im being so harsh, maybee its cause I just got off night shift and getting irritated that I couldnt figure out if this was a joke or not.

				I&#039;ve only read the beginning and end of this thread--will go back to read the middle--but her methods don&#039;t seem to be the cheapest anyway.<br /><br />Does anybody have alternative options for anonymously converting BTC to cash besides selling it on SR or localbitcoins? <br /><br />Also, as far as buying BTC, how does using non-anonymous methods (Coinbase, Dwolla through BitInstant) and sending through a mixer compare? A lot of people suggest buying through BlueSkyTraders or similar vendors, but doesn&#039;t that still have a trackability issue? Say, if BlueSkyTraders get investigated for laundering, their BTC can be traced back to me, etc.<br /><br />I hope this is clear-ish, I just haven&#039;t been able to find answers in others posts.

				Ok made it through all pages.&nbsp; Here is my .00000000002 bitcoins on the topic. Topshelf has valid points and I think your better off being paranoid than naive about the lengths LE will go to infiltrate the road. I feel he is free to post his opinion but should word it better like &quot;possible&quot; or &quot;Beware&quot; of LE phishing? I can see alot of haters or vendors trying to soil a competitors reputation. I can tell you that too many roadsters give up way to much information that is not needed in these&nbsp; forums. I like the point he made about them nibbling on the edges to get to the chore. LE are not that smart and almost every bust they get comes from the weak, CI&#039;s, snitches. The other 1% comes from sure luck. I say do your own homework and scour the forum for your answers. I&#039;ve been here since Jan. and have built my posts the good ole fashion way. I think that if this guide was so good it would get stickied! All I know is that I&#039;m not going to get busted. Now I am knocking on wood. knock knock.....<br />GP
