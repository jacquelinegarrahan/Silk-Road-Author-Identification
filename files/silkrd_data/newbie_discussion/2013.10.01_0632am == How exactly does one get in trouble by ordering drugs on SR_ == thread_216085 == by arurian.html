				Even if you enter your address without PGP, can&#039;t you always deny it? I could enter anybody&#039;s address, right? And they could enter mine.<br /><br />So why bother with PGP? And what&#039;s the chance that LE is going to do anything more than seize a package?

				That&#039;s true, but if someone is just buying small quantities every now and then, is it really that big of a risk?

				Some wont deal with you if you don&#039;t encrypt sensitive info.<br /><br />Kinda makes sense because it shows how a person &quot;views&quot; security.&nbsp; Like if you don&#039;t care about pgp then what else don&#039;t you care about?

				ManMist beat me to it. <br /><br />You can do everything right and still get busted. Hell, you can get busted because they had a typo on a search warrant and went to your house by mistake. All highly unlikely but it does happen. Using encryption is simply a case of controlling the variables that you can control.&nbsp;

				You guys make valid points. But has anybody ever heard a story about somebody getting their address intercepted by typing it in on the Silk Road?

				not that I&#039;m aware of.&nbsp; If that were the case I think pgp would be mandatory.&nbsp; A little hassle can save alot of ass wiping if you know what I mean&nbsp; ;)

				Buyers should always encrypt their address when making a purchase!&nbsp; I read an article online about a case in NY where the cops arrested someone at his home, and they subsequently found his computer logged into his Silk Road account.&nbsp; Obviously, the cops combed through his account.&nbsp; Orders are easily found, and unless addresses are encrypted, it gives prying eyes the golden key to a buyers identity and location.&nbsp; It&#039;s just another layer of protection in case something goes wrong.&nbsp; It&#039;s really simple technology, but is very smart to use!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, it&#039;s not just law enforcement that sellers worry about.&nbsp; All it takes is a prying girlfriend, roomate, etc. to look through someone&#039;s SR account and unless the name and address is encrypted, you are exposed.&nbsp; PGP is really very easy to learn.&nbsp; There are many threads about how to use it in the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t require my customers to use PGP to make an order, but I suggest it.&nbsp; I take security very seriously, and strive to protect my customers as much as I protect myself!

				The only thing gpg protects against is if the SR servers are compromised as SR encrypts the address box automaticalyy but that is still a possibility and Im not going to risk it esspecially with FH going down recently

Why would you want to risk getting your package siezed? Or even put yourself in a position to be questioned by the police? Even if your not convicted, you can bet your ass your on their radar. It&#039;s all about laying low and taking as many precautions as possible like someone above me said. PGP is not hard to learn. I went without it for damn near 2 years on SR and i have so much more peace of mind using it now.

				I was asking similar questions when I first came to the forums, &quot;Do I REALLY have to encrypt my address?&quot; The general consensus is that it&#039;s dumb not to. Why would you want to carelessly put yourself out there for any added risk when you&#039;re already using a black market website to buy drugs? PGP can be overwhelming at first, but once I stopped dragging my feet bout it and sat and to learn it, it only took me about an hour before I figured out how to encrypt my address. It&#039;s really not hard at all. Get to it!

				In the grand scheme of things it&#039;s not really that difficult to encrypt your address. <br /><br />Just highlight, copy, encrypt, paste. <br /><br />If you are complaining about not wanting to do a few clicks of the mouse to ensure your privacy then I think you have bigger things to worry about.<br /><br />
