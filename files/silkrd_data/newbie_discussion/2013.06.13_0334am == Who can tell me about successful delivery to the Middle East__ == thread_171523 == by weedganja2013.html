Another important detail is what product you&#039;re wondering about specifically, cannabis/hash or?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Police sit very tight on the border,Just for understanding 100 grams of hashish costs&nbsp; 1000$&nbsp; here</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s actually not that far off from the prices in Sweden though, that&#039;s nowhere near as bad as it is in for example Japan.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Now I found the question in itself interesting, so I&#039;ve decided to do some digging on domestic distributors for the Middle East on Silk Road. To begin with one would need the definition for the Middle East, I&#039;m basing this on the following wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East - in other word 17 countries. Here&#039;s how many listings I found by each respective country by switching my country location on another Silk Road user for each respective country:<br /><br />Bahrain: 0<br />Cyprus: 0<br />Egypt: 0<br />Iran: 0<br />Iraq: 0<br />Israel: 0<br />Jordan: 0<br />Kuwait: 0<br />Lebanon: 0<br />Oman: 0<br />State of Palestine: 0<br />Qatar: 0<br />Saudi Arabia: 0<br />Syria: 0<br />Turkey: 0<br />United Arab Emirates: 0<br />Yemen: 0<br /><br />You weren&#039;t kidding around when you said the area is dry.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />This basically concludes international is the only option available, but the question is how good are customs at intercepting packages in the different countries compared to for example Australia? I&#039;m also fairly certain there&#039;s not that many buyers from the Middle East on Silk Road except for perhaps Israel, and they probably have a significantly more predictable postal service than the other countries. Anyway hopefully someone with personal experience is able to answer more specifically than me since I don&#039;t live in the Middle East. :)

				So here we go,<br /><br />If we&#039;re talking about regular envelopes sent through regular mail, it&#039;s a 101%.<br />Anything else containing: pills, powder, etc.. get&#039;s caught, they send you a letter to go checkout at the airport, Yes airport; and that&#039;s the funny part - cause all they need is you to go to pay some fine to get this stuff tested!!! But as we Egyptians deal with our shitty government, they might just take a couple of 100&#039;s under the desk and release the package... I&#039;ve only done that once in the airport w/Steroids; but pills came to the post office and they asked me for the prescription cause they have to check the page &#039;since it came in a CD pack&#039; but I made the prescription note my self on MS Word. LOL<br /><br />I know we live in a shithole, but hey that&#039;s the best part of it; eh?

Until then the fact remains there is at the moment only one single Vendor in the entire Middle East ( Turkey ) on Silk Road and he&#039;s charging roughly $33 per gram for Hash.&nbsp; :o

Why? I don&#039;t know but I think I&#039;ll fail in the stealthiness of the package, don&#039;t want to ruin the market or disappoint people, cause apparently hash, and tramadol are the top drugs here for a shitty low price, so I&#039;m pretty sure that many have tried and failed.<br /><br />That&#039;s just my 2 cents if anyone wanna add..

Anyway if Egypt doesn&#039;t have any treaty with other Middle Eastern Countries to send shipments without Customs Declarations a treaty like that &quot;will&quot; be implemented within the coming ten years - if not they won&#039;t stand a chance to compete with Europe on anything whatsoever.<br /><br />So the main point is any shipment from Egypt to any Middle Eastern country will ( hopefully ) look a lot let suspicious than say something from the Netherlands or Germany. Even if it&#039;s ( hypothetically ) a small market now sooner or later it will get very big and as long as it&#039;s illegal there is very little competition in terms of anyone offering a consistent Product and Service ( I&#039;m assuming in this regard any people or establishment who are selling somewhat openly are paying heavy bribes to be able to do so at the moment ).<br /><br />Just some food for thought. :)
