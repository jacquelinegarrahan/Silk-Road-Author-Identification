				At the moment I am on Windows, I created a new user which I only use for SR, my tor browser bundle is stored on an USB-Flash drive which is encrypted with Truecrypt and before/after I run TorBrowser I run CCleaner. My addons for TOR Browser are: &quot;https everywhere&quot; and &quot;better privacy&quot; and NoScript is configured to deny scripts globally. <br /><br />Now I was thinking to format my usb-stick and use liberte linux instead. but then i&#039;ve read in another threat that there is the rumor that liberte isnt that anonymous because there are &quot;DNS-leaks&quot;. furthermore, what if there comes a new version of TOR-Bundle, is it possible to update the tor browser on liberte? And is liberte as safe as Truecrypt to get access to your data? (Or is it even possible to youse both truecrypt and liberte?) <br /><br />At first i wanted to use liberte instead of TrueCrypt because it seems a bit more anonymously because you cant get trojans / a virus / malware which may give information about your identity. But know I am not sure because I read about some leaks....<br /><br />And whats the best way to prevent that your ISP can see that you are using TOR? And what is TAILS? Is it an alternative to TrueCrypt?<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent a lot of time on this forum to get information (as I&#039;m totally new to this hole stuff) but it seems like everybody says something different. It would really help if someone could answer my questions, so where are the techpros out there? :-)<br /><br />(Info about me: i just want to buy small amounts, no vendor, but i really dont want to get into troubles, would be enough for me if cops where at my door, so i just want to make sure that they at least cant find anything!)

				Oh and when I need to surf the clearnet while using TOR, should i make this through normal firefox / TOR / or shouldnt i do this at all? (Of course just to read some guides about encrypting, no personal sites/anything like that)

				Hi mezzomixtor,<br /><br />I know how overwhelming it can all be once you get started. I was once where you are now so trust me I know the feeling. I&#039;ve gone down the path of using virtual machines, liberte, and other methods to secure and obfuscate my identity. I&#039;ve spent considerable time researching and reading and now do something that is very simple. I use a hardened Linux Debian distribution called TAILS.<br /><br />TAILS stands for &quot;The Amnesic Incognito Live System&quot; and is a standalone distribution which will allow you to securely safeguard yourself for anonymous browsing.<br /><br />I have it installed on a USB drive and the drive contains two basic partitions. <br />1. The primary partition for the TAILS operating system<br />2. A &quot;persistent&quot; storage partition that acts as an extended partition which is encrypted with your passphrase.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to use and will allow you to accomplish what you&#039;re seeking to do. Truecrypt has some major security flaws and I would NOT recommend it. But with every advice you receive, take it upon yourself to conduct your own research and see if TAILS is right for you. <br /><br />I hope this gives you a good place to start and best wishes brotha!<br /><br />-CC

				mezzomixtor, I think CannabisCrew&#039;s advice is solid.<br /><br />Tails, (as I understand it) boots it&#039;s own operating system via USB or DVD, works in RAM, and leaves no trace of it&#039;s use on the machine, (unless instructed)--it also forces any internet connection through Tor.<br /><br />As far as the Tor Browser Bundle goes, I wouldn&#039;t mess with it unless you know what you&#039;re doing, &quot;better privacy&quot; is not one of the add-ons showing on my up to date TBB. Given that we are placing our trust in them it seems apt to take their advice, that said, there&#039;s shitloads of outstanding and helpful advice right here, Pine and astor come to mind, although there are many more.<br /><br />Tails also has some cool features that come with it, great encryptionâ€¦ahh, you can read it for yourself :)<br /><br />Also, a common one that crops up with updating Tor, is to bin the version you&#039;re using before installing the update, folks have been having trouble with that.<br /><br />One thing I do is check the signature of what you&#039;re going to be running, you have to mess about a bit with command lines and such, but it&#039;s clearly explained in the Tails manual--you verify the software, you know it&#039;s safe, and you feel a bit less overwhelmed by the difficulty when you pull it off :)<br /><br />It&#039;s a pretty fucking cool hobby too, eh?

I&#039;m already reading all the information on the TAILS Homepage, and there is a loooooooot of information, I guess I&#039;ll need 2 more days till i am able to install it haha, maybe you can help me out once more with something i could not find on the documentation:<br /><br />Why is it recommended to use TAILS by burning it onto a DVD? And I assume that the encryption of the &quot;persistent&quot; storage partition is (of course only with a long enough passphrase) at least as hard to &quot;hack&quot; as the TrueCrypt encryption? So I should not worry about this point? <br /><br />And what did you mean with that?<br />&quot;Also, a common one that crops up with updating Tor, is to bin the version you&#039;re using before installing the update, folks have been having trouble with that.&quot; <br /><br />I guess you meant &quot;to back up&quot; the old version? <br /><br />Anyway big thx for your help so far! :-)

				Hi mezzomixtor, you&#039;re welcome!<br /><br />With regard to burning to DVD, it&#039;s my understanding that burning to a READ ONLY medium would prevent anyone messing around with the content of the disk--so assuming you had a clean version of Tails on a read only medium, it would stay safe, whereas saving it to USB could potentially leave you exposed to some form of computery malice simply given that it is accessible i.e. re-writable.<br /><br />For the record, I am not yet using tails, but I do verify the sig ( found around the big orange Tor download box) of the version of Tor I&#039;m about to download. This involves running a few lines of code to verify the integrity of the source--there are very clear instructions in the Tor manual on how to do this, and is mostly just a little cutting and pasting into your command line editor. Just make sure you are entering the correct version of the TorBB, or you will be in for a little confusion!! One of the files will end with a .zip extention, and the other .asc -- these have to be run in the correct order in one line with a space between the two files you will have downloaded. It may be slightly different on your operating system, but it&#039;s relatively simple even for my dumb old butt. Here&#039;s the link on how to verify the Tor sig.<br /><br />https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t help you with Trucrypt, I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s not going to be backwards compatible with Tails or some other such headache, and having so much to learn, I don&#039;t see the point in dedicating time to it.<br /><br />Regarding updating Tor, I just uninstall it from my machine entirely, download the new version (without opening it) check the sig (see the link) and when I get the &quot;Good signature&quot; message, open Tor and get back to having fun:-)<br /><br />The reason behind doing this, is that I read a fair bit about people having problems re-installing, and this was the solution that was suggested most, and it worked for me.<br /><br />I&#039;m a newbie myself, so please do your own checking, especially on the security threads--there really are some very clever people willing to help if you&#039;re willing to read widely and not ask the same questions over and over.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be investigating Tails more deeply very soon, and will share what I find out.<br /><br />Have a great day<br /><br /><br />

But you are right, I&#039;ll definitely use this method now to be 100% sure! <br /><br />Oh and one last question which i could not find out either: How should I use the clearnet during a tor-session? In the tor browser (i would do it like this) ; in the normal browser (tor browser would still be opened) ; or shouldn&#039;t i do this at all? And what about downloading files (for example TAILS .iso) <br /><br />I&#039;ve read that this should not be a problem, but the fact that most people write &quot;CLEARNET WARNING&quot; above every clearnet-link unsettles me a bit! ;)

You should be able to have your DVD readable in virtually any computer (with the exception of certain Mac&#039;s for some reason -or so I&#039;ve read). However, you will still need an Internet connection and if you&#039;re behind a domain security policy or Active Directory this might be harder than you think. You might not have the credentials to hop onto the network in say a library, but maybe not, so give it a try! :)<br /><br />If you&#039;re on a friend&#039;s computer and able to connect via WIFI then you are golden.<br /><br />----On a whole other note... TOR Bridges using Amazon Cloud. That&#039;s where its at ;)<br /><br />-CC<br />

				Hey guys<br /><br />I was able to install TAILS onto an USB-storage device and created a persistent volume. AT THE MOMENT I&#039;m having my encrypted file at the persistent volume, and after every start I encrypt it with Truecrypt. But according to TAILS documentary there may be some issues using Truecrypt, thats why i wanted to use LUKS instead (GNOME Disk Utility), the problem is that this program can only encrypt the complete storage media (for example a second USB-storage device) but not only a file in the persistent volume. (as far as i understand it)<br /><br />I think I will keep on using truecrypt, but i&#039;m not sure if even this is necessary. Isn&#039;t the sense of the passphrased persistent volume that your files are stored in this &quot;encrypted&quot; volume, the persistent volume? So why should I additionally encrypt it with another software? I&#039;m using a strong passphrase for the persistent volume, so shouldnt this be enough security? <br />

				ima clear net guy (same interesting stuff there, just more of it and much much much harder to find)<br /><br />heres how to stay anonymous<br /><br />virtual machine, windows xp, multi quad vpn, ssh tunneler, tor, store the vm on an encrypted drive, not encrypted with truecrypt as truecrypt can be beat with a $300 tool. use bitlocker. this makes you all good. not like you have to worry about getting in trouble for small drug orders (unless your shipping to your own address ofcoarse) then just get sent to a different name and make sure they cant prove you ordered the package.&nbsp;

				thx for your reply robbyman, but i think ill be fine with tails! <br /><br />And i am going to use real name (slightly changed first name) and my real address because using a different name might bring some unnecessary troubles and if i would order to another address (for example abandoned house or PO Box) LE could still catch me while picking up the parcel. So i think best way is to send everything to my home address and if LE comes i will just deny everything. <br /><br />Anyone who can answer my question from above? Is it even necessary to use an encryption tool together with the persistent volume from tails?
