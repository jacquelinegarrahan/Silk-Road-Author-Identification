				The ones on the real roads are bad enough ..... pulling people over because they&#039;ve profiled them, enforcing the road laws and law in general as &#039; fine and collect&#039; rather than &#039;serve and protect&#039;.<br /><br />But when it comes to SR I wonder how many pigs or LEO&#039;s as polite folk call them actually create buyers accounts, purchase small items&nbsp; ........... and then leave bad feedback ( there&#039;s a reason for the bad feedback&nbsp; aside from the fact they&#039;re natural&nbsp; assholes).<br /><br />Its obvious to me that police departments&nbsp; and perhaps customs would order silk road items for a number of reasons.<br /><br />They&#039;d want to see &#039; how it works&#039;. Whats the packaging like, whats the purity like etc. Its so obvious why they&#039;d do this I&#039;m not even going to say why.<br /><br />And they&#039;d naturally leave bad feed back because they&#039;d see spreading unease, dissension etc amongst silk road users and vendors as a positive result for them.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve never read of anyone suspecting the pigs and their other farmyard friends of soiling the site.<br /><br />Or am I mentioning the great unmentionable :-0&nbsp; &nbsp; !!!!!!!!!! ;-)&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				You really think so? What could they hope to achieve? They&#039;re not going to bring down the silkroad via negative feedback. Plus most vendors urge buys to resolve issues before leaving negative feedback, i.e. if there&#039;s a problem with your package or whatever- at least the one&#039;s I&#039;ve deat with do.

				Well I believe they&#039;d buy items in order to see how it all works and then they&#039;d try to formulate strategies to counter it as best they could.<br /><br />And if cops or customs agents purchased on silk road do we really believe they&#039;d leave good feedback ??? <br /><br />If they cant stop stop something they do their best to elevate peoples feelings of risk and unease.<br /><br />Plus its in their DNA&nbsp; &nbsp;....... they just try and fuck good things up.<br /><br />If I were a police commander I&#039;d be ordering all my staff to buy things&nbsp; from SR :-) :-0&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m sure they&#039;re aware of how creative and stealthy the vendors are. Getting ahold of a package ain&#039;t gonna do shit for them. Once they get a package, not much they can do after that. You&#039;re not thinking like a police commander lol

				What would they gain with negative feedback,,,,dissension? I think IF, cops were on the road , they would try to worm into the community and happy customers is what they would pose as. I also doubt any local police departments are gonna waste their limited resources buying drugds on the Road when it most likely wouldn&#039;t result in a bust. Now , federal agencies, DEA, FBI etc, might try to do something. If they did, I&#039;d imagine they would create a vendor account rather than be a buyer. A vendor would at least get names and addresses , useful info that might lead somewhere . But, I think there are legal issues with that . Entrapment maybe?

				This is a serious topic but it just makes me laugh to picture a plod sending in negative feedback for that gram of charlie they&#039;ve just destroyed ....<br /><br />I think people are underestimating the uselessness&nbsp; of our various &#039;drug squads &#039;, and to them one buyer put of buying represents a small victory ............ <br /><br />And never forget they often work in pairs&nbsp; &nbsp;.......&nbsp; the ol good buyer bad buyer routine :-0<br />&nbsp;. <br /><br /><br />Fact is often stranger than fiction <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Why would they do this?

				So if someone leaves a negative rating hey are a cop?<br /><br />Do people generally just always rate 5/5 just so the vendor doesn&#039;t have to suffer if it&#039;s a simple mistake? <br /><br />And the cops rate low because they know this and think a low rating will put the vendor out of business? <br /><br />With all the posts I&#039;ve seen saying some vendors are threatening buyers to change their rating to 5/5 even if it was bad service I guess it could make sense.<br /><br />Still I would assume that it&#039;s just a pissed off customer rather than a petty cop.<br /><br />Should just get rid of the rating and only have feedback. Seems next to worthless considering everyone always rates 5/5 no matter the service. <br />100% positive feedback is actually more suspicious. Gotta expect to have some pissed off or whiny customers every now and again. A few low ratings keeps things believable and makes you less likely think someones giving fake feedback to boost their rating. <br /><br />

				Drugs and other fun stuff has been shipped through the mail for much longer than SR&#039;s existence. They&#039;re well aware of many techniques, the issue is that these techniques make it look like a normal package. They can&#039;t single out packages easily.

				The police aren&#039;t gonna do anything purely because they don&#039;t have enough funding. They will only pursue a package if it is of very large capacity e.g 3+kg, if they bust that they can hold it for several days in anticipation that the buys orders another. That way they know the first package wasn&#039;t a mistake in postage. The costs for court and judicial services would set the feds back too much for what they would get out of it, they bust dealers not consumers. Plus bringing down an individual wont bring down Silk Road, this is why they favour monitoring data for any slip of IP address that could lead them to the operator of Silky, only then will they take full action.<br /><br />And i&#039;d also be very careful what you say, they could be among us now, reading this, never know.<br /><br />Peace and love<br /><br />MILKY

				Imagine if someone had said to you 5 years ago...<br /><br />&quot;hey man, there&#039;s this website you can get on...its like ebay for drugs. Order whatever you want, and it gets sent right to your door!&quot; <br /><br />I know my reaction would have been to call them a full blown retard. <br /><br />Now, I can&#039;t imagine getting drugs on the street. I don&#039;t even communicate with ANY street dealers I used to know unless they happen to be friends. <br /><br />Obviously SR gets its business up until recently from word of mouth, I for one tell no one. <br /><br />I can only imagine the reactions some get when explaining how this works to a friend. I know my reaction when I was brought into the loop was to immediately call shenanigans. <br /><br />At this point, anyone who thinks LEO isn&#039;t aware of SR, monitoring it and on it...is a moron. But as mentioned, because of the way it works the odds of anything getting accomplished by any law enforcement is slim to none so long as the proper protocol is followed but SR&#039;s users. <br /><br />Hi police. How are you today? If you happen to be reading, rest easy! As your job is to defend and protect me the citizen, I must tell you that this website along with the hard working people that provide information on illicit substances to educate us all have greatly reduced the risks I would take by purchasing substances blindly on the street. I know its not the best solution, and you don&#039;t want me using any substances that aren&#039;t backed by the government, but at least now I can test the contents of what I purchase and the sellers have some incentive to provide me with quality goods. <br /><br />I hope that helps you rest a little easier at night. Thank you for your continued work in protecting me and my fellow citizens. &lt;3

				I think drugs in the mail is not a new concept for cops and other LEO. People have been doing that for decades and they&#039;re well aware of what goes on. The problem lies within the manpower and resources to vet through the huge amount of mail that goes through on a daily basis. It&#039;s just too much to handle without slowing down the mail system and spending millions of dollars on a innocuous drug shipping rather than putting cops out on the street and arresting murders and rapists. At least I hope that&#039;s what they spend the money on. But just my humble opinion :)

				Not that I&#039;ve taken the time to read the rest of the thread, but...<br /><br />Of course there are LEOs on the road.&nbsp; It&#039;s a well known thing.&nbsp; What they can do with it is another story.&nbsp; They can... *gasp* order drugs.&nbsp; Which... doesn&#039;t help them at all.&nbsp; Except that now they&#039;ve ordered drugs.&nbsp; And in general, that&#039;s a bad thing for the cops.&nbsp; DEA maybe, they kind of get a carte blanche, but they probably understand how this works well enough to not bother.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought maybe the DEA might consider pulling a sting, setting up as a vendor and shipping a bunch of stuff, then hammering people as they receive it.&nbsp; But for that to be effective, they&#039;d want to hit people ordering ridiculous amounts, and that means they&#039;ve have to ship ridiculous amounts.&nbsp; Plus then lawyers get in the way.&nbsp; And yeah... trying to catch people from within SR itself is only worthwhile if they can hack it and find the servers.&nbsp; DPR&#039;s got us as covered as he can, and other than that, CYA rules have always applied here.
