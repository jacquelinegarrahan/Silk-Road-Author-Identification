				I don&#039;t do pill shit but damn is this a great idea but fuck pressing, put that shit in some gel caps and charge the dime extra they cost. Just be careful about moisture--I think that fucks with the caps. Time for sellers to make friends with some pharmacists. You don&#039;t think they trip? 10,000 tabs of soma per bottle and 10 go missing?

				It might be a fairly small market, that&#039;s the only issue.<br />Personally I think it&#039;d be easier to do gel caps, get some half-blue half-white capsules and stick your MDMA/whatever in there, it&#039;ll look like generic paracetamol or something. I could sell those if anyone wants them.<br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t be very difficult to create some generic-looking MDMA pills, I could do it relatively easily, but I&#039;ve not seen the demand there, because people who want to buy these things in large-ish quantities are typically purchasing them for resale and they don&#039;t want pills that look like cheap painkillers&nbsp; ;D

				They would be only able to sell on a market like the road. The nature would be for personal use only.
