				Just wondering how to contact vendors who used to list, and now don&#039;t - Trippy Nation seems to be in that boat - anyone know of a way to contact these vendors? Thanks for any help.

				I hope he&#039;s just off in spain for a couple weeks chilling, because he was a true gent, always well over on amounts, prompt with deliveries and good comms, most importantly though his 2CB was the best i&#039;ve had. <br />Anyhow, if you wants to try him, just type his name (trippynation as one word) in the search on SR home page and it will say at the top of the results one member found, just click on that and it will allow you to message him, I suppose it will have to be unencrypted unless you have his key, which could be a risk if he has been nabbed.<br />Fingers crossed he&#039;ll be opening the doors again soon !<br />

				He was banned from selling for threatening a buyer. He claimed he still had their address and would use it against them if they didn&#039;t change their feedback.<br /><br />I&#039;d stay away from him
