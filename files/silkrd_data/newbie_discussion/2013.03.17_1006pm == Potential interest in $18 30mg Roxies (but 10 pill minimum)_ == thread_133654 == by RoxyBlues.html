				Since I can&#039;t post in the product interest section.. posting here. The roxy prices on SR are insane. $30-35 a pill? I have nearly unlimited access (I get&nbsp; legit scripts a month, so does my girl, and so do&nbsp; &quot;friends&quot;).. and I flip them IRL for $20 bucks a pop (less for bulk) and I still make a fucking killing. I&#039;m thinking about setting up a vendor page. In fact, I&#039;m absolutely going to do that. I&#039;m curious, what would the interest be if I were to setup listings of $18 a pill (could be the M boxes, V,s A215s, K9s), with a minimum of 10 per order. Priority shipping would be free, and Express $20 (what I pay the PO).<br />Obviously would offer bulk pricing on 50 and 100 pills. What&#039;s the level of interest? I&#039;m all about making bread.. but not gouging people. I&#039;d rather have a customer who&#039;d steadily buy 10pills a week at the best price on the Road then charge them $33 a pill (are you shitting me?!) and mail 5 pill orders every 2 weeks. Fuck that!<br />The roxy vendors on SR are straight up gougers. I know this could ruffle feathers with some of them who think they have a monopoly because they have vast supply.. but they would not be able to buy me out as I&#039;ve got an unlimited supply channel. <br /><br />The only downsides I can see <br />1) People would buy bulk from me and then flip them @ a markup (still cheaper then current roxy vendor prices) here on the Road. Although to be honest I don&#039;t see the harm. <br />2) People attracted to that kind of cheap pricing would be the kind of people prone to scamming (just sayin.. lower income buyers = more desperate/fiends). Would counter this with sellers with less then 5 transactions/high refund rate would have to FE. Sorry, that&#039;s life.<br />3)Shitload of work for as I&#039;d probably be flooded. But that&#039;s not a bad problem to have! ;)<br /><br />So, would there be an interest? $18 roxies, free PRIORITY shipping, and discounts on bulk. Orders would be sent out the next day.<br />Yay? Nay? Would like your feedback here or via PM. <br /><br />(oh and current roxy vendors.. feel free to bitch to one another and collude with a plan to buy out my supply. You&#039;d be welcome to order.. show me the money baby hahaha)<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to annoy your current vendor you can inbox me privately or roxyblues@tormail.org<br />I&#039;m trying to gauge the potential level of interest before I setup shop. I&#039;m assuming it would be massive.

				Oh yeah :) Well if I get enough interest I&#039;m gonna set one up. There is money to be made in volume without gouging buyers with $30-35 dollar a pill + shipping + 0 communication. Fuck that.<br />Just weary that I&#039;d attract scammers and fiends because of literally 50% cheaper then going SR rates for the roxies. Would probably send 1 (JUST ONE) free sample when I set up my vendor page to prove I&#039;m legit. Would make the buyer pay shipping though. Oh I&#039;m liking this idea more and more. Sorry price-gouging-roxy-vendors ..&nbsp; ;D

				Interest level would obviously be insane. Just my 2 cents but I do find the roxy prices here steep compared to IRL. But I guess that&#039;s the price of doing business. And more or less all the established vendors have similar price. There are some random vendors that show up with low prices (haven&#039;t seen $18 though) who seem to run out within hours, a day max. If you have shitload of supply, I would say you&#039;d probably still sell out at some point. The demand for roxy is really unreal. The comment about them &quot;colluding to buy up your supply&quot; cracked me up. This aint oil and OPEC we&#039;re talking about LOL. But if you were able to have a steady supply on hand, fuck it, why not? You&#039;re biggest problem would be handling the massive amounts of orders you&#039;d have coming in day and night. $18 for a 30? We&#039;re talking $180 bucks for 10 (including shipping)? Jesus christ, start vending ASAP. You&#039;ll be a god amongst mortals. And you&#039;d create an entire legion of new addicts. LOL.

				I would def buy at that price. Vendors here charge up the ass, and I can get the cheaper in real life, with less risk of getting ass raped in jail due to the unfortunate CD. <br /><br />I would NOT order if you require FE. I am an honest buyer, and I understand you may request that from some people, but that defeats the whole purpose of escrow and unfortunately I just don&#039;t play that way. I&#039;d rather order bulk here and pay 25-27 than have the unfortunate event of getting scammed or losing the package and then having no way to resolve the issue :-(<br /><br />With that said I hope you take that into consideration and get a vendor account pronto!!!<br />

				Doub&#039;t I&#039;d run out. I&#039;ve got resources&nbsp; 8)<br />Could handle fast shipping once I get the kinks worked out. Never vended online before. IRL, I know what I&#039;m fucking doing.<br />And FYI - my shit = USA made pharmacy fresh.&nbsp;

				Bulk purchasers will buy you out in a day....no need to worry about being too busy as you&#039;ll have only a few buyers because they will buy you out of stock;).&nbsp; &nbsp;It would make sense for resellers to consistently buy you out of stock so that they can keep the end-user pricing where it is....it&#039;s just good business.&nbsp; &nbsp;Regardless, you can&#039;t fail when it comes to Roxies and you will become rich...fast.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just make sure you do business in a way that insures that you are not too busy to offer good service.&nbsp;

				Let them buy in bulk, without getting into specifics I have access to nearly unlimited supply a month. Sure there could be a few days where I&#039;m out of stock, but where theres a will theres a way.<br />Yeah, I would need to figure out a method for proper customer service as I would be flooded. I have a few ideas for that too. <br />As for the current vendors immediately trying to buy in bulk and resell at their fixed price (which believe me, they&#039;ve all agreed to price fix. Well, some of them have.. the other lonely boys offering at even $25 a pill usually get missed because they dont have a gazillion transactions to their name. <br /><br />Anybody know how long it takes to get a vendor page approved? I know I have to put up the $500 entry fee. No problemo. How soon do they &quot;approve&quot; the account? <br />Fuck I&#039;m lazy! Hahahaha.

				Roxy I think what you are doing is great! Just don&#039;t forget about the small time buyers as well! There is a huge market for that due to the high price of the product. Some people can&#039;t afford to buy high amounts. If you could offer small amounts at great prices you could make a killing just by reaching out to those users.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t wanna see the bulk buyers eat you up and things end up being the same IE Blues still costing 35+ per pill. (fucking murder!)<br /><br />Rock on Roxy!<br />

				I hear you my friend! Thank you, I&#039;m excited about this. Will absolutely not forget about the &quot;small buyers&quot;. Every dollar is equal to me. Just doing all the math, I think I can potentially make a killing (potentially more then the gouger vendors because they may charge more but then don&#039;t sell as much product).. so I could make up for that in quantity. Might not be able to offer same day shipping though.. that would stretch me very thin. Will work out the kinks before I have the vendor page up.

				The market is all about what people are willing to pay for a known quantity. I imagine sellers of pharmaceuticals have an easier time breaking into the market here than do sellers of other drugs that could be god knows what. Pharms could be too, don&#039;t get me wrong, but less likely.<br /><br />You already know there is a ton of interest. Make sure you price accordingly to cover SR&#039;s cut and your shipping costs. <br /><br />The biggest problem with being the cheapest seller is you are going to get all of the worst customers. Even at $18 each you are going to have people trying to scam that down and bug.<br /><br />If you are going to deal with the bullshit from cheap asses then make sure it is worth it financially. You are not here to make friends, you are here to make money. Don&#039;t forget that fact.<br /><br />
