				I ordered it (mdma) early yesterday (powerade cancelled myfirst one&nbsp; :&#039;() and now I noticed that he has no listings up and someone else in the Rumor Mill was saying that their order was cancelled yesterday. I&#039;m hoping, since mine isn&#039;t cancelled, that he is still planning on taking it on.<br /><br />What do you think? I&#039;m going to keep it for a couple days, but should I cancel after two days and take my business elsewhere? He seems to be a great vendor, but extremely lacking in the communications department.

				I bought from him and he marked &#039;in transit&#039; Feb 4th and I&#039;m still waiting. I hope it arrives because I ordered from that jackass DopeDistributor last time and he never delivered. Went with mister m100 because he had a good record...<br /><br />Edit: Received it today (17 days after &#039;in transit&#039;). Left a full review over in the rumor mill. Overall a good transaction but the product coming in .36g underweight left a bad taste in my mouth. Hopefully you guys fair better.

				Well I hope we did the right thing by ordering with him. He needs a bigger presence here on the forums (as far as I know he has ZERO presence). That much I know for sure.

				No vendor forum account and not great SR communication. I suddenly wish I hadn&#039;t rushed to order so quickly.

				I think you should wait like you said, then take your business elsewhere. He&#039;s either overwhelmed with orders or out of product. Or just not good at what he does.

				I too ordered 10 gs from mister m100. After I saw un settling feedback regarding quality, I asked him to cancel order. Never heard back then he shipped. We shall see. First order in a few months. Also ordered through another vendor in germany. Ill update.

				I received a small 2g from him about 2 weeks ago.<br /><br />While I never even tried to message him about the order it arrived to the East Coast in about 9 days and quality is superb.<br /><br />-Mel

				Order marked in transit with m100 feb 10th, shipping to usa. I saw someone who had given feedback on his page, saying their order was shipped on same day, and arrived feb 19th to east usa. I&#039;m central so may have a part in waiting period, but someone left more feedback today saying they place their order the 13th and it arrived today. Not too concerned, just a little impatient and anxious/jealous mines taking longer! hah

				@ masongate ... can&#039;t tell if you&#039;re serious or not, so i&#039;ll leave it be. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m seeing a lot of positive feedback both here, the rumor mill, and on his actual vendor feedback so i&#039;m feeling more confident now. I just want to see that &quot;processing&quot; go to &quot;in transit&quot; so bad I can&#039;t see straight haha

				Still hasn&#039;t come today, dunno what happened if it doesn&#039;t come tomorrow, considering one of his batches reached mid-east usa today, and east us 2 days before. Guess we&#039;ll see though, hoping on a prayer so i have it for the weekend.

After that bring up the thought of a refund or reship, just don&#039;t finalize until the product comes or a resolution is made.<br /><br />I hope it comes to you!<br /><br />-Mel

				i ordered 5g from him last friday and it was marked in transit on monday. it is now friday and am getting impatient. i didnt expect it to get here today, but am crossing my fingers for tomorrow, or hopefully early next week. ive read several feedback that seems promising from this vendor, but also quite a few saying they never received. this is my first order from over seas and am hoping all goes well. any experience with mister m100 would be appreciated
