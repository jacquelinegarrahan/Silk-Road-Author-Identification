				Is there any interest in kali 1.0.1 (the new BackTrack based on Debian linux) on a persistent bootable 16Gb Flash drive with TrueCrypt and Tor bundle tested and working? This is not a virtual machine image, the computer boots directly into the kali on the flash drive. It also has a FAT partition where you can store and transfer data between it and any other computer and there&#039;s a hidden TrueCrypt partition within that FAT partition for any data that needs to be kept private.<br /><br />It&#039;s like having a computer that fits in your pocket and all you have to do is plug it into a USB port of any computer that will boot off a USB drive.<br /><br />Price would be about 1 Bitcoin shipped next day.<br /><br />I&#039;d be happy to provide another distro if preferred but, since kali was specifically built for pen testing and security, I thought it would be the most appropriate here.

				Why would someone buy a freely downloadable operating system for seventy-something dollars?&nbsp; &nbsp;C&#039;mon, why don&#039;t you just be a nice guy and tell people where they can get it themselves (or they can just google it)?&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t like to see people trying to profit from open source software projects where the developers have donated countless hours to developing the software, earning nothing in the way of renumeration.&nbsp; Sure, if someone is really technically a newbie and asks your help in putting it on a flash drive, I could see that being OK.&nbsp; But selling open source software ain&#039;t cool.

				I just noticed that was your first post in the forums.&nbsp; Now I feel a little bad for coming down on you like that on your first post.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t change how I feel about the subject, but I do want to say welcome.&nbsp; I&#039;m really not such a bad guy as I might have come off in my reply.

Thus, when I went to the considerable trouble of finding out why none of them worked and making one that did, I had hoped to turn a profit on that investment of time and effort. Incidentally, it is the persistence that nobody seemed to be getting right and without it updates have to be downloaded each time the stick is booted, nothing can be saved across sessions, etc. It&#039;s pretty much useless.<br /><br />Also, I saw someone selling a virtual machine image of what sounds like kali or BackTrack on Silk Road and what I&#039;d like to offer has obvious advantages over that since it requires no host software and the computer boots directly to the OS on the stick.<br /><br />I&#039;m not offended by your outrage and if there was not some considerable value added to the freely available kali iso, it would not have occurred to me to offer it for sale. I think that there is but if, after considering the above you still think there is not, then I thank you for your opinion and will reconsider my position.<br /><br />Thank you for the welcome and contrary to what you initially thought, I do hope to contribute something meaningful to the community. Thank you for your interest and feedback.
