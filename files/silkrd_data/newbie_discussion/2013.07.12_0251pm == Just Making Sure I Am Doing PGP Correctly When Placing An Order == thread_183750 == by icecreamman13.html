				Hey everyone...I just need confirmation that I am doing this correctly when I am using PGP to send shipping information. <br />*I am using TAILS and the built in PGP. Also, I am not using a persistent state for security reasons, so keys aren&#039;t &quot;Saved&quot;. <br /><br />1. Go to vendor page and get public key<br />2. Open gedit and paste the public key. Highlight it all, and choose FILE&gt;Decrypt<br />3. Click Save <br />4. Click the Clipboard on the top bar and choose &quot;Manage Keys&quot;<br />5. File &gt; Import the key I just saved<br />6. Now shows in &quot;Other Keys&quot;<br />7. Go back to gedit<br />8. Open a blank document and enter shipping infomation<br />9. Highlight all text<br />10. Go to Edit &gt; Encrypt<br />11. Choose the vendor I am ordering from<br />12. Now the document is the PGP Message<br />13. Copy that, paste it in the comments section of the order and vendor decrypts?<br /><br />Is that it? <br /><br />As far as decrypting or having my OWN PGP key, is that necessary if I am only ordering? I am guessing that if a vendor is going to message me back for any reason (hasn&#039;t happened yet and I am guessing vendors want at little back and forth messaging as possible) then I would just use their key again from their page and decrypt it (assuming they sent it encrypted)? <br /><br />This whole PGP is confusing to me so I appreciate your pateince. :)

				Yeah, you&#039;ve got it right.&nbsp; But good lord, what a hassle man... just set up a persistent volume.&nbsp; If you&#039;re only buying stuff, nobody&#039;s gonna care enough to rip apart your drive**.<br /><br />** That&#039;s only my opinion.&nbsp; Others may disagree.<br /><br /><br />No, you&#039;d need your own private-public keypair to decrypt a message they sent to you (that&#039;s IF it were encrypted, but if you don&#039;t give them a public key, there&#039;s no way they even can encrypt a message for you).&nbsp; They&#039;re pairs.&nbsp; What&#039;s encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by the paired private key (which you don&#039;t give out, that&#039;s only for you, naturally).&nbsp; So you&#039;d need persistent storage of *some* kind to store your private key, and then you&#039;d give the vendor your public one.

				SS thank you for your help! <br /><br />I do realize that I may had been making it too difficult on myself and that when I decrypt the original PGP key, it&#039;s auto-saved and I don&#039;t have to go to the Manage Keys and import it, so that axes about 1/2 of the steps that I wrote above. <br /><br />Call me paranoid but I prefer not to use a persistent volume. I don&#039;t want anything that remotely may show that I may be &quot;hiding something&quot; in a worst-case scenerio ever comes down. But I do want to make sure that I am using PGP for an order. <br /><br />I have been playing around trying to use the PGP club keys and messages to see if I can decrypt them, but whenever I am trying to open a message it states that I don&#039;t have the proper key. But again that&#039;s just for reading messages right now, so i have to figure that out. If I can get comfortable enough with all of this I may eventually move to a persistent state drive. <br /><br />Thanks so much for your help! The search function here on the forums isn&#039;t the greatest.

				yeah you&#039;re using it correctly.<br /><br />also keep on doing so. it only takes a couple of minutes and gives you some excellent additional security.<br /><br />pgp every time for sensitive info<br /><br />+1 to you for sussing it out and being security conscious
