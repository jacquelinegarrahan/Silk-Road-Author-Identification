				Hello all. We are currently a US domestic LSD vendor, specializing in low-volume sales. <br /><br />For the upcoming Labor Day holiday, we would like to offer a greater value to our customers. After several brainstorming sessions, we&#039;ve narrowed down our ideas and feel we should allow the consumers themselves to decide.<br /><br />As a potential LSD buyer, would you prefer to see a &quot;buy X tabs, get 1 free&quot; special or 5/10-strip listings at a reduced price? The average price-per-tab will be the same in either case.<br /><br />Both offers have their pros and cons;<br /><br />1. Bulk pricing would allow for pre-packaging of larger orders, which means last-minute purchases would be more likely to ship same day. However, buyers looking to purchase odd amounts would have to spend more time browsing multiple listings and possibly pay for additional shipping.<br /><br />2. Alternatively, &quot;Buy X, get 1 free&quot; is more flexible for buyers who may not have interest in or enough BTC for, let&#039;s say, a full 10-strip. These orders would require more packaging time, and late afternoon purchases may not ship until the next day. <br /><br />Thank you for your input. We value the SilkRoad community&#039;s feedback and we look forward to dealing with you soon.

				Personally, I would prefer bulk pricing, as it simplifies the price. Essentially, Buy X get 1 free is the same as bulk pricing, only more complicated. In the end no matter how you sell it, what it comes down to is the price per tab. For example, Buy 10 get 1 free would be 11 tabs vs an 11 tab listing. Also with buy X get 1 free, you end up with odd numbers which only complicates things more. Bulk pricing all day.
