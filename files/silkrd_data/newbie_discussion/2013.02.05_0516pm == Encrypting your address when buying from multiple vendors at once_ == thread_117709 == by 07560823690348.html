				I have two items in my cart from two different vendors, and I&#039;m already new to PGP in the first place, so I have no idea how to go about encrypting my address for both of them so that both will be able to decrypt it. <br /><br />I actually can&#039;t even figure out how to add a public key to gpa... so if someone could explain that to me as well, I can&#039;t find it in any of the tutorials on the forums and searching for pgp or public key obviously doesn&#039;t yield many usable results. <br /><br />Thanks in advance.

				You could try making two separate orders, might be easier. As for PGP, all you have to do is copy the vendor&#039;s PGP, paste it into a text editor, highlight the vendors PGP, then right click, go to services, and then import hit &#039;import key from selection&#039;, that will put the vendor into your GPG Keychain Access. After that delete all the text, type all your info, highlight, and encrypt the message, it will ask who you want to encrypt to, so just make sure you choose the right person and the encryption should turn your info into a PGP message. Hope that helped, that&#039;s exactly how I do it on my mac.

				1 by 1<br /><br />take a item from one vendor, encrypt for him, place the order. then next order<br /><br />i think it wasnÂ´t possible to give to various sellers your address in one time, because each seller have his own PGP-Key<br /><br />greets<br />

				You can encrypt a message to multiple recipients as long as you have already imported their public keys. Simply select all the recipients you want to be able to decrypt the message before you encrypt it.

				If you didn&#039;t do it right, they won&#039;t be able to see it, and they&#039;ll let you know. If you did, eventually your order status should change.
