				As long as everything goes smoothly, I&#039;ll be sticking around for a while. I don&#039;t like connecting with random people on the street to find what I need. This way seems a lot more safe and the fact that it incorporates a review system makes it that much better.

				It is a miracle and i appreciate it as much as when i found it nearly 2 years ago. Much love to DPR and all the people involved in its creation and upkeep.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found some vendors on here i really consider to be my friend for the way they help me out and treat me. During this bitcoin shit with Bitinstant going on i had a vendor who knew how desperate i was offer to have me deposit to his friends account through a Bank of America if i was out of options so i could get my coins and buy my much needed pills from him. I found another way but i really appreciated that. I FE for this guy and this guy only because of all the exceptions, custom listings for me, and times he has shared from his personal stash when he wasn&#039;t selling to help me out. I may not know the guy personally but i feel a friendship bond from all those times he helped me.

				I hope it sticks around for a long time. I&#039;ve only been here shortly, but I&#039;m very happy there is a platform like this. I don&#039;t like the idea of buying &#039;on the street&#039; at all! I also hope that the heads of SR don&#039;t lose track of what they initially wanted. Keep running a tight ship, don&#039;t get greedy and this place will only flourish. <br /><br />Stay safe everyone and enjoy life!

				I&#039;ve been lurking here for about 2 weeks using the search function to gather information to understand PGP, bitcoins, TAILS and how these things play into the big picture. The forums are an amazing resource and without them I probably would have had to work a lot harder and been a lot more confused.<br /><br />About to make my first purchases soon- excited but also nervous as fuck. <br /><br />This place truly is amazing and I&#039;ve only been here a VERY short amount of time but am extremely grateful for such a service!

				Completely. I had heard about the road ~1 year ago but always wrote it off as stupid, dangerous, and mainly very very scary. I have found some of the most helpful people while dealing here. Without putting any serious thought to the idea of the road, one assumes it is a place full of crooks and criminals looking to make quick money. Fortunately, I have found quite the opposite (ofc sticking to reputable vendors and the like) and am incredibly pleased. As long as we patrons of the road do not sell out for quick cash, or scam, or anything of that order. We can keep this place going string! Long live SilkRoad

				I&#039;ve made less than a dozen SR transactions and they&#039;ve all been trouble free. None of them needed FE. It was definitely worth spending the extra time needed to carefully read the SR feedback for both the product and the vendor, as well as checking out the info here on the forums. It&#039;s great that I can now get hold of drugs which were previously unavailable, but more importantly SR gives me access to high quality products. Some stuff still awaits testing, but at least two of the items are the cleanest I&#039;ve come across for years. What&#039;s the point of snorting bucketfulls of local powders cut 100:1 (or more) which have little effect other than nose damage? Paying 20 times the price for 100 times the quality is a no-brainer.
