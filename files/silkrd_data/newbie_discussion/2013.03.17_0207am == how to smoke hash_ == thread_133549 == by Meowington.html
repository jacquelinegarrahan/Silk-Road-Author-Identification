				so I got my hands on some hash with opium mix... And I was planning on using the bottle method for lighting it up... but Ni was just wondering how do I actually smoke it.. how do the takes go... do I just inhale normally and exhale normally? How long do I hold.. I know different substances have different ways of takes... so.. looking for any responses :) also can someone tell me what to expect from the high? thanks.

				Smoking hash has very similar effects to smoking buds. I think the high is a little more mellow and relaxing than smoking pot. This of course depends on the type of hash you get. Some has is way more potent that certain buds and will knock you on your ass. <br /><br />As far as smoking it, there is no right or wrong way. Anyway you smoke weed you can smoke the hash. You can mix it with some pot in a bowl, or just smoke it out of a bowl by itself.<br /><br />My favorite way to smoke hash would be with a thumb tack and a clear glass. Apply some hash to the thumb tack and light the hash until it catches and smoke starts to rise. Then put the glass on top of the thumb tack. (You probably want to do this on the corner of a table or book. Once the glass has filled with smoke you can move it just enough so you can put your lips on the opening and clear the smoke from the glass. <br /><br />I hope that makes sense lol it&#039;s harder to explain than I thought, but the process is quite simple and since you are trapping all of the smoke in the glass you barely lose any smoke! Efficiency&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If this is confusing try searching the clearnet or YouTube for &quot;Smoking Hash out of Cup&quot; and you will get a more visual explanation.<br /><br />Hope this helps!!

				yeah his way with the glass and the thumb tack was the bottle way I was referring to. But thanks for all of the top lies! I&#039;ll probably light some up here in a few minutes. :)

				smoke a bowl down to the ashes, if it is good clean bud it will burn to a white ash. Put hash on top of ashes. Otherwise it is best to use a hash nail device or oil burner pipe.

				Knife hits for sure! Mixing it into a bowl will waste the hash! Any moment you are not hitting the bowl, the hash will still burn (especially if its bubble hash) and you will lose smoke. As far as smoking it, just straight into your lungs (you really don&#039;t need to hold in hits). <br /><br />Normally, hash hits get people extremely high. High as the first couple times you started gettin real high on pot.... so it can definitely knock you on your ass. Opium is a lot mellower of a high but I&#039;ve only smoked opium twice (and not much of it either). Just know you will definitely be very stoned :)<br /><br />Heat up a butter knife&nbsp; until it becomes red hot on a stove. Get another knife to put the hash on. Press the knife with the hash against the heated knife underneath a soda bottle that has had its bottom cut off. This way you won&#039;t lose much smoke and you will burn all the hash at once. Most people will just heat up both the knives. Either way should work but I think that is the most efficient way other than buying a hash rig. <br /><br />If you still don&#039;t get it, just look it up on youtube. There are plenty of videos of people doing knife hits on there.

				Do any of you know if something like this would be good for use with hash?:<br /><br />*CLEARNET WARNING*<br /><br />http://www.everyonedoesit.com/online_headshop/smoke-bubble-vaporiser-2.cfm?iProductID=2062<br /><br />If not, what else might be worth considering purchasing? Or would options like the thumb-tack method, hot-knifing etc that don&#039;t require paraphernalia be the way to go? <br /><br />Many thanks.

				KNIFE HITS<br /><br />Heat the tips of two butter knifes until red hot. Take a little chunk of hash and carefully set it on the hot edge of one knife. Smash the hot edge of the other knife into the hash. Making a hot has snadwhich. The smoke with rise up. Cup your hands around your mouth and capture the smoke like a vacuum. Brilliant mehtods. works wonderfully.
