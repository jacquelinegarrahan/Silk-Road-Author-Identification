				Just got some tasty looking BHO butter from PrivateReserve.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a concentrate before.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how to smoke/vap it.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to use my PAX vap, but I don&#039;t want to clog it up or anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any ideas?&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t look like an oil to dip a cig in.

				Get yourself a G pen or something to the effect, you wont regret it its my most handy device.&nbsp; Also try some full melt bubble hash, I like the taste better and plus its not processed with chemicals like BHO. Much easier on the lungs!

				Will a G Pen work with ground up bud too?<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen bubble hash, is it liquid like BHO?

				I agree. Water extracted is much smoother personally

				If you wanna smoke it without going to get any fancy utensils, get a paperclip and scrape up a fat dab. Then take a lighter and heat the paperclip (but don&#039;t flame the BHO!) until the BHO liquifies and drips off the paperclip, onto a bowl of some delicious buds. <br /><br />Blamo! Honey buds!&nbsp; 8)

				Figured I&#039;d review my BHO order from PrivateReserve…<br /><br />First off, let me say that PrivateReserve is by far the most communicative vendor I’ve dealt with on SR. He answers my questions promptly and makes sure the overall experience is enjoyable.<br /><br />I recently ordered one gram of the OG Kush BHO. I placed the order early on Thursday (EST) and amazingly the package was waiting in my mailbox when I got home Sunday night (I was out of town all weekend so probably came on Saturday). The package was discreet and packaged very professionally.<br /><br />Now to the product itself – the OGK BHO was AMAZING! The color was a very nice dark-amber and the consistency was nice and gooey (especially since I had just taken it out of the mailbox in summer). After close inspection it is clear that he purged this stuff very well. I hit a few dabs from my Volcano and was very nicely stoned for a good 3 hours. The OGK gives off a VERY clean euphoric high that did not cause me to be couch-locked. This stuff kept me feeling happy, relaxed, and creative the entire time. <br /><br />Here’s a pic of my order: http://imgur.com/w4Xd3ny <br /><br />Needless to say, I am a satisfied customer. I just placed another order for his White Widow BHO which I am eagerly waiting to arrive.

				I have a Pax as well but would strongly recommend against using BHO butter/wax/shatter in it, it could clog up and lead to a big mess and probably wouldn&#039;t be that effective. I purchased an Atomos Thermo W and it works great for these types of concentrates.
