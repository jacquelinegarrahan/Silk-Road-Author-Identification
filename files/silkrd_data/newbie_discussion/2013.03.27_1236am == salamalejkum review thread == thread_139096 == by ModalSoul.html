				Has anybody ordered from the vendor salamalejkum? He has good ratings so I&#039;m not too worried about the products. I&#039;m wondering more specifically about how long it takes to get the US. If you have comments about his service/quality I&#039;d like to hear that too.&nbsp; If anybody has any information it will be appreciated!

It took a couple days to get in transit and then about 8 to reach the US. It was short by around 20mg but it is potent. Snorting about 10mg was a ++ trip that hit in waves for about 4-5 hours. <br /><br />I did also receive what he listed as LSB at the same time as the 4-aco-dmt, but have since received a message saying that he made a mistake and it is in fact LSZ. This worries me that his other products might be mislabeled but his high ratings make me think otherwise. Though if something seems strange about one of his listings, I would say proceed with caution.

				Please do! I know the listing says the 4-aco-DMT is white. Most of the feedback does not mention the colour. Out of the 2 that do, 1 says white and 1 says brown and sticky, so I&#039;d be really interested in what you receive.

				I received 4-aco-dmt from this vendor. The powder is slightly off-white unfortunately, but I&#039;m still looking forward to trying it out. Vendor done well in that he sent it during the outage and I was very surprised when it turned up. Unfortunately it wasn&#039;t vacuum packed... I assume dogs aren&#039;t trained to smell this stuff but I was under the impression that it&#039;s just standard to vacuum pack on silk road (maybe I&#039;m wrong for this sort of thing?)<br /><br />And I could be wrong, but I think vacuum packing 4-aco-dmt will maybe slow down the degradation process. If that&#039;s the case then it really should have been used.<br /><br />Anyway, it was cheap and the vendor sent it in very good time at the point where it really looked like SR might be totally down for a few days, which is pretty awesome. Should be giving it a try in a week or so.

				Came back to update and correct some of my original statements. The 4-aco-dmt actually was white, the person who received the package was wrong about this. I tried a small dose at the weekend, lovely stuff.

				So far I am BEYOND impressed with this vendor. I saw the listing for Proscaline pop up on the front page and was like &quot;WTF???&quot; I am a connoisseur of fine/rare/weird psychedelics, and that&#039;s one I wasn&#039;t sure I&#039;d ever see... much less a decent sized sample for pretty cheap! I was about to jump all over it... till I looked at this seller&#039;s other listings and pretty much crapped myself. No way, this dude cloud not possibly have this bevy of strange and exotic psychedelic drugs in tiny amounts for cheap! I scrambled to assemble as much btc as possible and contacted him to see if there was any way to arrange a custom order. He was VERY fast to answer my messages, super courteous, and bent over backwards to work with me and get me basically every chemical he had that I&#039;d never tried, in amounts that will keep me busy for at least the rest of this summer (hell, year??) just trying them all out in a couple of different doses and contexts each. To say nothing of potential combos, holy fuck. I feel an incredible responsibility to test each and every one of these drugs with the utmost care and respect. Some of them have almost no record of use in human subjects, so the potential for negative reactions is a very real&nbsp; concern, even with careful planning and the best of sets and settings. At the very least, this vendor&#039;s service and overall attitude have been just about the best I&#039;ve encountered on&nbsp; the road, which already starts this long and incredible series of experiments with a really, really positive vibe. &lt;3<br /><br />Oh, and STUPIDLY fast shipping, like 6 days to midwest usa. Faster than some domestic orders! Not the highest-tech stealth, but it archived just fine.<br /><br />I am so excited. This is going to be a very interesting summer! LOL I will update with new posts as I try each chemical. This is gonna take a while.<br /><br />Fuck! :D

				I put in an order almost two weeks ago, and I&#039;m eagerly awaiting my mail.&nbsp; I hope I don&#039;t have to hit resolve before the auto finalize, but I still have hope!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I will post an update as soon as stuff happens, hopefully very soon!

				Anybody know about shipping with this guy? I&#039;ve placed an order for 4-HO-MiDP but he said something about signing for it.. There&#039;s a bit of a language barrier.<br /><br />If I need to sign for it, should I? I&#039;m not sure of the legality of this substance (I don&#039;t live in Europe or the US)

				I got 25-D (2.5mg) 4-aco-dmt and 5-meo-dalt.<br /><br />The DALT was NOT dalt! I dont know what I smoked, but it gave me no effect what so ever and gooey&#039;d up my vapor pipe. I was SUPER pissed not knowing what the hell I just smoked. He gave me a refund but I recall seeing another person complain of the same thing that he sent something and wasnt really sure if it was what it was.<br /><br />Maybe his other shit is okay but his organizational skills are extremely poor if he&#039;s selling people THE WRONG DRUGS. Who knows how bad it was to smoke whatever I just smoked?<br /><br />The 4-aco-dmt gave me only 1 ever so slight visual-morphing at 15mcg insulflated, and a bunch of friends at a different time insulflated 20-25mcg with no visuals only a giggly experience.<br /><br />Has anyone tried his 25-D ? Im scared to try it now since I had a &#039;unknown&#039; experience with something else he sold me, and those heavy tabs are nothing to fuck with.

				Hmm.. well off of about 20 mg of his 4-HO-MiDP I got mild hallucinations. Quite fun though so I guess it&#039;s okay
