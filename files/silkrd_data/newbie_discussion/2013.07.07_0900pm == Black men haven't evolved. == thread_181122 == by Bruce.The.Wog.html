				/spam to 50/&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oh ya i know right .&nbsp; really though knowing mostly white people are the ones i worry about. (maybe 95% of people i know are white) i dont judge that small fraction of other people who are colored as being more of a threat to me because they arnt! at least where i live that is. it fact a lot of the black people here are doing really well for themselves and making good money in good jobs.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i bet they just stole a white persons idea though, and thats why theres all these worthless whites around.

				Feminism was a convenient and politically expedient excuse to keep the brothers and sisters on the plantation.&nbsp; However I agree that when Steinem said &quot;A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,&quot; it did presage the whole thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Race politics, like pussy politics, is in part an income transfer.&nbsp; However I think race politics is more about power.&nbsp; <br /><br />The US political system right now is absolutely dependent on keeping the brothers and sisters beholden to the party of George Wallace, not to put too fine a point on it.&nbsp; How else do you explain the difference in the way Justice Thomas is treated, compared with Eric Holder?&nbsp; They way we say Susan Rice is authentically black, and Condoleeza Rice isn&#039;t?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Not to give the Republicans a pass on this.&nbsp; The Republican myth is that freedom was granted by Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp; What happened to &quot;we believe that men are endowed by their creator by certain inalienable rights&quot;?&nbsp; The Republican party thinks it is holding that lien, and that&#039;s why they&#039;re pissed (not sad, not contrite, pissed) that blacks don&#039;t vote Republican.&nbsp; <br /><br />No wonder black men are cynical.&nbsp; &nbsp;They know the deck is stacked, I&#039;m just not sure many know precisely how.&nbsp; They call it racism, but I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; You can&#039;t find one true racist in a thousand white people.&nbsp; It&#039;s not racism, precisely.&nbsp; But the man is keeping them down. <br /><br />The question is, which men?&nbsp; The truth will set us free.&nbsp; <br /><br />Heh!&nbsp; This is the only forum where I have the gonads to say this.&nbsp; Anonymity has its virtues, doesn&#039;t it.&nbsp;

				Back before I moved out of the backwoods I would&#039;ve agreed with you.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that humanity as a whole is slowing our evolution.<br /><br />If the problems with the fringe groups of blacks that still act like thugs are just because blacks aren&#039;t evolving, how do you explain the wannabe white boys typically hanging around them with dreads and wifebeaters? Or the Asians? Or Hispanics that do it even worse and more lulzy with shitty neon cars and vibrating sound systems? It&#039;s not a racial thing, it&#039;s just some people are fucking stupid and it&#039;s as if that number of people is ever increasing.

				My fwiw, as a smallish furry black pussy...my avatar is at least, and I like to represent. I feel compelled to respond to this, as it is either a rather feeble attempt at humor, trolling for notoriety to get views and responses jacked up for the thread, or it really does represent the point of view of OP. <br /><br />Black men evolving...or not. No question, the topic is feeble, and ill thought out, as any one with Google has the capacity to ferret out for themselves where the progenitors of our species originated. <br /><br />If the OP is referencing the high crime rate in inner city ghettos, still, not accurate. The most heinous of crimes against humanity are perpetrated by the ruling class of aged, males of caucasiodal descent. Those responsible for ENRON, whitey. Those responsible for the pyramid scheme perpetrated by the Stanford Group, crackah mofos. And let us not forget to include that sorry sonuvabiotch who is rotting in prison, and his son committed suicide, rather than be crucified in the public eye...anybody...think long and hard...could it be...a WHITE MAN? No, keep race out of the equation. Humans either commit atrocities, violating the covenants of society, or they don&#039;t. Evil knows no zip code, has no barriers. <br /><br />

				On the subject of IQ&#039;s Idunno how many here have had theirs tested by reputable, registered, acknowledged professionals in the field, but I have. I have been a member of Mensa since 1988. I have met in our meetings and events, humans from every walk of life, every spectrum of the human experience. <br /><br />From garbage men, to hookers, to lawyers and politicians, to the lowliest of guttern snipes, barely civilized, but had the capacity and finances to take a proctored IQ examination and return results consistent with the bell curve for genius. Now, they might have been able to pilot a rocket ship, but incompetent when it comes to making a decent sandwich. <br /><br />The bigotry and fear of &quot;other&quot; contributes to the allienation and sense of disenfranchisement the marginalized members of any society experience. When we have had a spiritual awakening, en masse,species wide, then this racist, homophobic, sexist, paternalistic, mysogynistic, bullshit can finally be laid to rest. Go learn some quantic mechanical theory. We are them, and they are us.

No question, the topic is feeble, and ill thought out, as any one with Google has the capacity to ferret out for themselves where the progenitors of our species originated. <br /><br />If the OP is referencing the high crime rate in inner city ghettos, still, not accurate. The most heinous of crimes against humanity are perpetrated by the ruling class of aged, males of caucasiodal descent. Those responsible for ENRON, whitey. Those responsible for the pyramid scheme perpetrated by the Stanford Group, crackah mofos. And let us not forget to include that sorry sonuvabiotch who is rotting in prison, and his son committed suicide, rather than be crucified in the public eye...anybody...think long and hard...could it be...a WHITE MAN? No, keep race out of the equation. Humans either commit atrocities, violating the covenants of society, or they don&#039;t. Evil knows no zip code, has no barriers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I want you to do unspeakable things to me.<br /><br /><br /><br />Warm regards,

				I.Q. is not considered an effective measure of intelligence. Tests tend to be biased in favour of certain cultures, such as referring to English-language proverbs or the <br />What&#039;s more there&#039;s a large range of intelligence types it doesn&#039;t even test for; creative problem solving, effective abstract thought expression, ability to manipulate &amp; motivate (psychos score high here)<br /><br />As for the racist board topic, it&#039;s dumb as shit too. From the time the first H. sapiens spread out from Africa (200,000 years ago; not long on the evolutionary scale) our evolution is limited to some physical variances related to migratory environmental adaptation (e.g. height tendencies in plains/deserts vs mountains/jungles), which is what we now refer to as &#039;race&#039;. Each race adapted for optimal survival; the only thing race tells us is that our species is excellent at adapting. <br /><br />Behavioral evolution such as ability to reason, communicate, and understand the abstract has clearly happened to all the ancient groups. There aren&#039;t any races, tribes, communities, or other groups in which these traits cannot be found. Naturally, some groups developed different traits to higher levels, e.g. some never developed written language. They didn&#039;t need it. It&#039;s not a marker of intelligence, in fact it would be stupid to waste time and resources on developing an unneeded skill. <br /><br />I&#039;m considering a theory that groups of ancient Europeans (whites, likely central &amp; northern areas) did not develop empathy to as high levels as some others, and instead inclined toward interspecific competition. It would explain at least why we&#039;re the ones with the most extensive and global history of greed. (extend that line of thought to the effects of population density and limited resources, given that Europe is a small area. traits resulting from this could be ruthlessness, individualism, hoarding, innovation, tendency to explore, you see where I&#039;m going? British Empire?)<br /><br />All of JohnRambo&#039;s posts are conspiracy-theorist hate-mongering shock-value statements backed by very flawed/no logic/evidence. If it looks like a troll and sounds like a troll, why don&#039;t the mods block it for trolling?
