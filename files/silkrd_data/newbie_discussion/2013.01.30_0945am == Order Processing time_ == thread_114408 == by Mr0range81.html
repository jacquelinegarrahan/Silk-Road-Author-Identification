				Hey everyone, SR noob here, just made my first purchase and confirmed the order details. It takes me to a screen showing me the status of the order and its just sitting on &quot;Processing&quot; as the status and has been for the last couple of hours. It mentions about hitting the finalize button but there is no finalise button that i can see? Is this normal?<br />Any assistance would be appreciated. <br /><br />Cheers.

As a general rule if an order is marked as &#039;in transit&#039; really quickly you can guarantee it&#039;s not. Personally I prefer my order to sit as processing until it has actually been shipped otherwise it screws with you shipping estimate and you think it&#039;s late when in actual fact it&#039;s not at all.

				Thanks for the advice guys. Appreciated. Also, SR strongly advises to use the escrow service when ordering. However, when i place my order there didn&#039;t seem to be any option to put my coins in escrow? whats with that? did i miss something? is there a section/thread somewhere where i can learn more about escrow.

				thye say that because if the seller doesnt give you your product or say something happen, then SR can help you get your money back but when you FE sr cant do anything to help you get your money back. the FE will show up after the vender marks it for trasit. correct me if i am wrong at all guys to help him out.

Think of escrow as the 3rd person who holds the funds for both you and the vendor, you can release the funds at anytime once in escrow but strongly advise against doing that until your shipment has arrived and you are happy with the purchase. Any issues cannot be resolved once you have finalized, that is why finalizing early is not a good idea.

				Any payment you make to any vendor automatically goes into escrow. That&#039;s how SR works. <br />Unless you are dealing with a trusted vendor (how you trust a vendor is worth its own whole forum, but sometimes as a newbie you have to take a risk to prove yourself, too), never finalize early (FE). <br />When the gear arrives, you click finalize and the vendor gets the money. If it never arrives, you can resolve, which usually means asking for a refund/ reship/ or just extending the time to give it more time in the post.<br />If you finalize early and the gear doesn&#039;t show, SR can&#039;t really help.<br />If you stay in escrow and the gear doesn&#039;t show, you have options.<br />Find sellers that will let you stay in escrow - they are out there.
