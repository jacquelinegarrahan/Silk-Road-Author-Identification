				Any other newbies having problems with Frank Matthews recently? <br /><br />Seems that alot, if not all orders posted on Monday the 14th January never made their destinations. <br />I was unfortunate enough to be one of those customers. <br /><br />I just wish FM would acknowledge us and do something to resolve the problem. <br /><br />To make things seem even more suspicious, I&#039;ve placed orders with c63AMG whilst I was waiting on FM&#039;s order. And C63&#039;s product turned up almost immediately. <br />So it&#039;s obviously not a problem with customs or the postal service.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Haha, registered specifically for this reason. <br />I ordered in December, that was a no-show, then re-ship at start of January - also no show. <br /><br />I think he or the post office made a lot of mistakes around Christmas and he is not re-shipping. <br />He is still keeping a lot of customers happy, but I think the cracks are showing in his operation. <br /><br />There&#039;s no way I&#039;m ordering again, he sounded quite angry when I asked for a re-ship.. I think he is too paranoid about getting screwed. <br />

				btw, I have several previous successful transactions with Frank, like his gear (even the &#039;controversial&#039; batch of MDMA) and was a happy customer up until this. <br />I hope this is a bump in the road, more than the sign of a new supertrips style crash, but I&#039;m not betting on that with my money :p

				I share your plight hippo. <br /><br />Never had a problem with FM until now. <br />Here&#039;s hoping he&#039;ll be willing to resolve things...&nbsp;

				I&#039;m going to order with another few vendors, if those orders get through (I suspect they will) I&#039;m reducing my feedback to 1. I really doubt he bothered with a re-ship and it&#039;s very irritating. I understand he is paranoid, but he must also understand the Christmas/New Year mail period is shit and lots of stuff gets lost. Would love to have my 50 posts to complain properly, but am going to wait a week to see how other vendors packages get on. <br /><br />I think the fact your c63 order got through makes it obvious he&#039;s not doing the re-ships that he said he would do. Assuming you used the same address for all packages, why would his fail? You got no love letter from customs, no police visit, nothing.. it makes no sense. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve ordered twice from Frank Matthews- once on Feb 11th and once on Feb 16th, and both orders got here to south Asia in about 10 days or so. Outside packaging is well done and a very smart and stealthy choice by him, I think. The blow is good, not great, and it will totally fuck up your nose if you don&#039;t go easy. Like, I did 2 Gs in 9 hours, by myself, and paid the price for a couple days in sinus hell. His #4 H is hard for me to rate because it&#039;s only the second time I&#039;ve done it. My first order was from Ugly Doll and all I know is I was FUCKED UP, just staring at my computer screen open-mouthed. Just snorted a very small amount of Frank&#039;s (about the size of a match head) and am already feeling pretty groovy after 10 minutes. I&#039;m no expert on H, but it seems pretty damn good to me. <br /><br />I do have 3 decades of experience with blow and I can say that for the price it&#039;s okay. Though, really, all the blow on SR is priced outrageously. So far, I&#039;ve bought blow from Frank, MIMM (whose stuff still isn&#039;t here after 17 days),&nbsp; Lexq, Sukey, and Charlie &amp; Mollie (that one was through a friend who bought it here) and my opinion is that Lexq has the best shit. Best for the money is probably Frank. I didn&#039;t think Charlie and Mollie&#039;s was all that great. Sukey&#039;s seems as though it may have some kind of speed in there, I&#039;m not sure. I do know that I personally didn&#039;t enjoy the hyped-up, sweaty, Sukey blow at all. In fairness to him though, that may be because I snorted a half-gram in one go, and the rest of the G shortly thereafter. That, too, might explain it. <br /><br />IMO, in terms of packaging, Frank Matthews wins hands-down. I fucking HATE that he makes everyone FE though. In terms of communication and the quality of blow itself, Lexq wins for sure. He was all over that order and I got three messages from him- and very quickly too. Nice dude (if it IS a dude). I think I&#039;ll go with him and then place an order with someone new next time just to see what&#039;s out there.
