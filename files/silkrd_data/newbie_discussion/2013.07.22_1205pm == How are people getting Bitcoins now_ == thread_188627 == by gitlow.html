				I&#039;m not a total newbie, but I forgot my other login, and it doesn&#039;t matter anyway, since SR wiped my old (idle) account (annoying policy for people like me who are constantly on/off the wagon).<br /><br />ANYWAY... is it just me, or is it WAY more of a pain to get Bitcoins now? MtGox no longer accepts Dwolla... so I dig a little and find CampBX, who do accept Dwolla, only to discover that they hold coins for 31 days on new accounts... then I find LocalBitcoins, but most sellers accept OKPay or WebMoney, neither of which can be funded from the US.<br /><br />So, how are people getting their Bitcoins nowadays?! Am I going to have to actually LEAVE THE HOUSE(!) to buy a MoneyPak, pay an outrageous fee to a Bitcoin vendor on SR, and cross my fingers that I get my coins?

				From another thread:<br /><br /><br /><br />The following places are all TOR accessible while being clearnet sites. <br />Since buying Bitcoins is perfectly legal, using your regular ISP is fine. <br /><br />Many accept various forms of payment from MoneyPak, MoneyGram, Dwolla, Money Order and cash deposit to a bank.<br /><br />⚀ LocalBitCoins - https://localbitcoins.com/<br />⚀ Bitcoin Brokers - www.bitcoin-brokers.org<br />⚀ CampBX (exchange/broker) - https://campbx.com/<br />⚀ BitSTamp - https://www.bitstamp.net<br />⚀ Bitcoin OTC - bitcoin-otc.com<br />⚀ CoinBase - https://coinbase.com/<br />⚀ MoneyPakTrader - https://moneypaktrader.com/<br />⚀ Virwox (exchange) - https://www.virwox.com<br />⚀ NanaimoGold - https://www.nanaimogold.com/buy.php<br />⚀ BTCQuick - https://www.btcquick.com/beta/<br />

				LocalBitcoins and similar systems are definitely the best way to go.<br /><br />In some places, buying and selling bitcoins is limited because there arent many in the market locally, however, anyone reselling bitcoins they bought in bulk from unusual markets or bought bitcoins by selling large amounts of gold and silver in exchange for bitcoins in exchange for dwolla, moneypak and paypal (with strict controls to prevent fraud) or even square to accept credit cards (again, using a prepaid burn phone that you regularly dispose of and replace) and with strict controls and limits to prevent fraud.<br /><br />I may suggest accepting ACH (bank wire transfer) or whatever the equivalent is in your country of residence, or something like Western Union or Moneygram, and then buy AND sell bitcoins, so that it&#039;s easier to afford an expensive habit.<br /><br />Buying and selling bitcoins locally, either via localbitcoins or another mechanism, including quiet invite-only offline communities or clubs, is the way to go.<br /><br />Huge financial gateways like mtgox and similar is asking for trouble.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be suckered in by huge mtgox-like financial gateways. They are obvious high-value targets for law enforcement if not honeypots to begin with, avoid them like the plague.

				localbitcoins are definitely my favorite way to do it these days. All other methods are getting increasingly difficult.

				Unfortunately, LocalBitcoins doesn&#039;t appear to be an option for me. I&#039;m in the US, so I can&#039;t buy using OKPay or WebMoney. And I&#039;m in a remote area, so there are no local cash options.<br /><br />CoinBase looks good, but there&#039;s still several days of messing around before new users can get coins.<br /><br />It looks like the old MoneyPak method is my only option, which is VERY uncool with me, due to the inherent risk.<br /><br />What a total bummer.
