				Alright, so I made a really stupid mistake and bought stuff on here. I bout a whole gram of mdma and pot, the pot being due to be delivered tomorrow. What are the chances that something will go awry with the mdma being shipped from&nbsp; the UK to the USA and what could happen if it does. I mean the dealer (ivory) seems reputable but i really don&#039;t know and now I am flipping out, especially what if it was delivered in a parcel to the door and i have to sign, or would i have to sign for the pot if its domestic and priority usps because I am just losing it right about now and I could really use some idea on if I could be screwed or not .....

				Trannyraver you can chill, the police would not even bother to knock on your door to question you over either amount. At worst you would get a customs letter and maybe a letter asking you to come down to your local station in worst case but they never charge people for small amounts in the USA. I have read tonnes of stories small amounts you just get questioned or customs letter.

				Well thats comforting I guess... Any idea if a amount like that typically would be delivered to a mail box? Because that would be even more comforting...<br />

				just like the person said before they dont have the time for 1 gram. they are looking for bigger orders. like right now i have a 100g order of MDMA im waiting on. talk about stressing there. but clean house make sure you dont have too many orders at once not a good idea if one gets caught you get another one and they catch that one. would be harder for you to say its not yours. dont ever talk if anyone asks and dont tell any one anything about what your doing.

				Since when is buying shit here a bad mistake? Overseas is a little less than desirable but people do that all the time. Chill bro, it will be in your mailbox most likely.

				If you don&#039;t have any criminal records I&#039;d say you&#039;re pretty safe.<br /><br />You could even say that you have no idea who had sent you the package. You didn&#039;t order anything, it must have been an error.<br /><br />You&#039;re innocent until proven guilty. Anybody in the world can send mail to any person in this world. You cannot control what&#039;s in your inbox.<br /><br />

				Yeah good points. A clean house, dont order more than one package a month IMO, and always hold onto the mail for a few days with RTS written on it,

				Just relax and just don&#039;t sign for anything, and you&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; Imagine it is from Amazon, and as long as the vendor didn&#039;t put some stupid shit to make it look fake it will be fine.&nbsp; Any vendor in the 90&#039;s with more than 100 transactions is going to be A+ for stealth though.<br /><br />VENDORS THE GOAL IS TO MAKE IT LOOK LEGIT, NOT TO MAKE AN INSIDE JOKE ABOUT THE DRUGS INSIDE.

				Yeah, Probably want to avoid ordering overseas. They can open any package without any warrant. Mail goes thru a little more scrutiny. Once your get a love letter. Your mail gets flagged every time. <br />

				ivory&#039;s one of the only vendors left from around 2 years ago. i&#039;m sure he knows how to package international orders by now. uk isn&#039;t a much of a red flag like nl either.

				I freaked out like you the first time I bought contraband on SR.<br /><br />I bought a lot of stuff, some drugs I never even heard of! Analogous to a young girl walking into a sweet shop with her dad&#039;s wallet; apeshit!<br /><br />I was stressing so much and then checked my mailbox later that day. Everything was delivered and I realised just how unfounded my worries were. <br /><br />If you ever have to sign for a package you didn&#039;t expect to sign for, just claim ignorance and tell the delivery man you don&#039;t know who that package is for. This way you truly absolve yourself from any affiliation, provided you used as pseudonym of course.
