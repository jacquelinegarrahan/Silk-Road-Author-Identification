				Hi everybody,<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit old school (read - I am actually getting old), don&#039;t do social networks, twitter, and all that crap. I have been using SR for 5 months and having spent a lot of time on the forums where other people have put time in to post I just thought I would say hi.<br /><br />I came about this place when my girlfriend hinted that she would like to try acid, about two years ago. She is a lot younger than me (I am a lucky bastard), and I didn&#039;t have a clue since it was years since I hung with the kind of crazies who had access to things like that.<br /><br />Careful internet research, a chance conversation in a bar, and frankly big cojones on my part, and I took the plunge into what seemed like the Wild West.<br /><br />I have been astonished by what I have found here, not just the great gear (that&#039;s nice!), but the fact that Silk Road works, the vendors I have used are totally reliable, the forums are full of people with the same belief in freedom that I have and look out for each other so much, and particularly by DPR&#039;s commitment to what is going on here. <br /><br />So I would like to thank you all, vendors, buyers, mods, DPR, everyone involved. It has been said before, but the first time I used Silk Road and the postman popped his unknown pleasures thru the letterbox, it truly felt like the future.<br /><br />And the acid? Blew my girlfriends brain to fucking pieces. What a night.<br /><br />Take care all. Thanks for reading.

				<br /><br />+1&nbsp; for Freedom!<br /><br />&nbsp;I thought the wild west analogy was dead-on.&nbsp; ;) So far, my experience with Silk Road has been a good one even though I did have some money stolen with another account. No bad reflection on The Road, that money was stolen because of my mistake and it&#039;s nobody&#039;s fault but mine. It wasn&#039;t too much, and I still consider it money well spent, even if for the opportunities Silk Road provides alone.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
