				kinda fucked up topic&nbsp; &nbsp;but something interesting imo<br />so,&nbsp; people who have done notable amounts of &quot;hard&quot; drugs over the years.<br />such as amphetamines, alcohol, barbituates, nmda dissociatives (ketamine, pcp, mxe. dxm),&nbsp; cocaine and etc<br /><br /><br />what sort of health effects have you accumulated over the years that you attribute to drug use and what type of drug(s) how much? <br /><br /><br />i&#039;ll start, i&#039;m big on amphetamines and alcohol.&nbsp; drank heavily from age 11 to 19,&nbsp; used various amphetamines from 14-17.&nbsp; &nbsp;quit both because of liver damage,&nbsp; intestinal problems, low physical energy, my jaw pops out of place all the time.<br /><br />anyone else have some intriguing problems?

				I&#039;ve known a few hard drug users who inevitably just look weak- like they couldn&#039;t run a mile or lift a weight to save their life. Finally, the development of nervous ticks is always of concern.

				I&#039;ve had and seen various. I&#039;m of the opinion these days you need to spend as much as you do on drugs on healthy food to balance out the effects... fucking hard to do unless you grow your own :D&nbsp; &nbsp;Not bragging just stating experience!

				alcohol when young, and simple&nbsp; overeating and lack of exercise are main issues.&nbsp; the volcano vaporizer seems to provide a fairly health way to extract medicinal value from weed now.

				Exercise regularly, eat well and of the right quantities and don&#039;t over indulge in any drug and you can stay healthy and use most drugs without detriment but by statistics the world over alcohol is by far the most damaging drug of all along with tobacco and both of these as we know are legal. We live in a world that is upside down thank the gods for Silk Road.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i think the damage by alcohol and tobacco are overstated&nbsp; statistically&nbsp; because they are the most popular<br /><br />as far as brain damage<br /><br />huffing petroleum based solvents, paint&nbsp; and the like <br />pcp, methamphetamine, nitrous oxide<br />heavy habitual mdma, ketamine or cocaine use<br />and then heavy habitual use of GABA oriented drugs such as barbituates and alcohol (to a smaller extentent benzodiazapines)<br />negligible mental detriment would be of non-habitual&nbsp; non-heavy use of mdma, ketamine, cocaine&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />habitual use of tobacco, caffeine, marijuana, opiates (uncut)&nbsp; &nbsp;also seem no mental detriment or effect when ceased<br /><br />bodily harm is different story and more complex as different drugs effect different parts of body, and ways of detriment making the pretty much incomparable <br />although i would believe methamphetamine would wear body out the fastest<br />heavy alcohol, tobbacco or acetaminophen use would likely kill you faster<br /><br />other drugs are easier to overdose on such as heroin<br /><br /><br />so really which one is the worst? i don&#039;t think its that simple
