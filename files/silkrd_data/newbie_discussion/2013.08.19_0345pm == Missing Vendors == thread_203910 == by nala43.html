				Even thoug I am posting this in the Newbie Section I am not to the Road. However, whats troubling me is that several really good vendors have either publicly called it quits or have dropped off (No I am not talking vacations). Example:<br /><br />A vendor who always had great stuff, recently went offline and has not come back on. No reason given just gone! He or She is not answering any messages at all. This vendor has been up for a long time and is not known for this. With Tormail going down and being compromised you have to assume that people using the email system has had their emails compromised. Any personal info and your toast. I hope this vendor is not one of them. Now what happens when the vendor surfices&#039;? How do you know its really him or her? (sercurity suggestions please). <br /><br />Another key vendor recently openly stated he was calling it quits. I PM him and said really? All of the sudden I get a message back he is thinking about it but not sure. Well he was earlier? Some people may respond to this post as calm down etc but these are things to think about ecspecially since Tormail has been compromised. You have to ask yourself is this the same vendor I have been dealing with or someone else?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				With the tormail deal I am sure a lot of smart venders have chilled out. You have to wonder as well how many just got paranoid and will be returning as a new vender as some time passes. If their mail was compromised I highly doubt they will return with the same identity and most likely no where near the location they started from.
