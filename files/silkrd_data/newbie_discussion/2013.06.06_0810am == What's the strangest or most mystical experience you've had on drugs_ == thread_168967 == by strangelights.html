				I&#039;m just curious what strange things have happened to you on drugs.<br /><br />Mine is: I broke four ribs while on acid, then talked myself out of feeling any pain.&nbsp; (I was standing on my kitchen counter trying to reach the tea on the top shelf when I slipped and fell.)&nbsp; I convinced myself that I only thought it hurt because the impact made such a loud sound. I then carried on with my day without thinking any more about it and had a fantastic trip. The next day, I woke up in incredible pain and went to the doctor. He was incredulous that I hadn&#039;t gone to urgent care immediately after it happened.

				that&#039;s funny story! I&#039;ve never broken any bones so I can&#039;t imagine how that would feel. wow. <br /><br />the weirdest for me was when I smoked salvia and I thought that everything that was happening on the TV was effecting what was happening in reality, it really freaked me out so I had to go lie down until it wore off. afterwards my friend said I was laughing at stuff, but I don&#039;t remember that.<br /><br />&quot;you took too much man, you took too much!&quot;

				Sometimes when I get really high on weed I have the power to effortlessly identify people&#039;s insecurities, fears, and motives. Even my own. This truly opened my eyes to how incredibly shallow all human beings, including myself, really are.
