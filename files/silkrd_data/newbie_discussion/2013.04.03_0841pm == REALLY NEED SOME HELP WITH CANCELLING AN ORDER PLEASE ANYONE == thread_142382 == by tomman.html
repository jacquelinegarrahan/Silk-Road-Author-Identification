				Placed an order and 30mins later found out drop house is compromised. It is a security issue I couldn&#039;t of predicted and the timing couldn&#039;t of been any worse. I am praying the seller sees my messages before shipping order. If any staff read this please contact me as if you can auto cancel this could save me and the seller any problems that could be prevented. The order is of a high value that is the only reason I am looking for staff help as the contents could pose serious danger if sent.<br />Thanks to all who can help. I know staff are very busy all the time but I see staff as the only people who can now prevent a possible big problem for me and the seller.&nbsp; *Money is not the main issue here, it is safety for all parties.

				Step 1 - turn off Caps Lock<br /><br />Step 2 - PM seller a couple of times<br /><br />Step 3 - Hope they read before they ship - if it really was 30 minutes, it seems unlikely that there wouldn&#039;t be time for seller to abort<br /><br />If the seller takes even rudimentary caution in shipping, then they should be OK.&nbsp; It&#039;s your drop house so I guess the burden falls on you, unfortunately.&nbsp; Good luck.

				Thanks everyone for fast replies. Sorry about caps/newb behavior. <br /><br />I guess I was really asking if staff have a function to auto cancel or not. Its just a shame to leave this situation down to the chance of whether seller looks at messages as if he does he obviously will not want to ship and jepodise his safety either. Ive messaged but the time difference makes it difficult. <br /><br />I just hope he checks..

				I mean if the staff were to cancel it for you there would be a chance the vendor could have already shipped and then he would be screwed out of his coin.&nbsp; You could try PMing support I guess but I think they&#039;re kind of slow at responding at contacting the vendor directly would be better.&nbsp; Just put &quot;Please cancel order - Security Issue&quot; or something as the title of your PM.
