				I have been visiting India for last 7 years. This year I came to Nepal for the first time. The country is very beautiful and nice friendly people. I was in western Nepal for last six months, where no tourist other tourist go. I came across many good Charas, something that I have never ever tried. Very highflying and very good. Some thing similar to Manali first cream but even better. The main thing that grows here is Cannabis and nettle. The people are extremely poor and they survive on barley and maize. Most of the charas grown here gets exported to Kathmandu and goes directly to European countries. <br /><br />I made few friends with nice young people on the mountains. I took a huge piece of land on lease with the villagers and I showed them how to grow the Cannabis properly. I did not use any imported seeds. I used the local seeds. Only thing here the plants grows wildly, the plants are not taken care. They do not cut it regularly. So the plant it self becomes massive and the buds do not grow properly. <br /><br />Now I have planted over 30k plants with 2.5 meters apart from each other and used locally produced organic fertilizers. The plants should be ready by early of October. <br /><br />So we will have the best of the best Charas only hand rubbed from the buds not from the leaves at all .<br /><br />&nbsp;During October, I will need one more person who could work with me. Since I will be in the village growing and taking care of the plants. I need some one who could take the charas to bigger city like Delhi or Kathmandu to post it to our SR friends and give them the best of the best. <br />I will not reply for request to meet me in person. You willl have to come to Doti district in Nepal. If u come there, I will know and we could have a chat. I am not afraid of any authorities there&nbsp; and i also know none of the cops would want to trek for few days to catch me. <br /><br />I will up date on the plants and how things are going in the mountains. Stay tuned. the best Charas in the world is coming soon on your door way.
