				I&#039;ve seen many posts about peoples BTC deposits taking a very long time to reach their SR wallet (many who&#039;ve seen 50+ confirmations in the blockchain but still have not seen their coins int he SR wallet).<br /><br />I am also in the same boat, been waiting a little over 4 hours now.<br /><br />I have not seen one post about anyone actually RECEIVING their BTC&#039;s in their wallet. The moderators (scout and Libertas) have said over and over that there is a delay and that we should wait at least 24 hours for the deposit to take place.<br /><br />My question is, when was the last successful deposit anyone has had? This morning? Last night? <br />It seems to me that it is not just a delay, but that for the time being no one is able to have their coins deposited no matter how long they&#039;ve been waiting. Has anyone had any success?

				WOW guys, ive seen all the other threads as well, and sheesh. <br /><br />I mean its not unheard of, cause ive been there before also, but only a handfull of times, when BC was experiencing tech. difficulties.<br /><br />Ive made like 5 transactions in the past 3 days, and they all went so damn smooth and quick, i was astonished. <br /><br />Im talking less than 6 confirmations and I seen my coin.<br /><br />Just be patient fellas. I know it sucks, but chill out, the money isnt lost, just breaking your balls,lol.

				I keep saying this everywhere, but I&#039;ll say it again: this has happened before, and will probably happen again.&nbsp; It&#039;s not unheard of for the site to experience issues like these - particularly after this recent site attack when DPR and staff had to adjust things on the server to fight against it.
