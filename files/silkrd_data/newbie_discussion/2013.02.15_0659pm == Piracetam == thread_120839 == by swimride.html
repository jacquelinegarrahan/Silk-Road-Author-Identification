				Has anyone on here tried smoking weed while taking piracetam? I have been taking it for a few weeks now, and started smoking weed about a week ago. I haven&#039;t really smoked at all in several years. I feel like I am still high the day after and I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s because of the piracetam. <br /><br />Anyone else ever had this experience?

				I&#039;ve used some stronger members of the racetam family while doing other drugs. Can&#039;t say I noticed the effect with weed though. I did notice a lessening of effect with DXM though.

				I&#039;m mostly using it for MDMA. I was thinking about trying aniracetam but I haven&#039;t heard if that too potentates MDMA or not.

				Glad to see this topic. I had just read some folks talking about Piracetam in a mdma thread. Only now hearing about how some praise it <br />before taking mdma. Where is the best &amp; cheapest places to purchase Piracetam in the U.S.?<br />This is my first post by the way. 8)

				I was ordering mine from Amazon, but there isn&#039;t much on there right now. I did find some capsules that had choline in them as well on ebay.

				. ebay is a good place to start, there are a few of the nootropics that work well in everyday life, they can make you feel quite up and as a pre loader for mdma you can also use 5htp or my favorite Phenylalanine.&nbsp;

				Piracetam is placebo lol<br /><br />Works only in huge doses (&gt;&gt;1200) and with choline (contra nasty headaches)
