				I have a trusty little glass pipe in red/green/yellow that I named &quot;Rasta&quot;.&nbsp; I know, original, right?<br /><br />I had bubbler named &quot;Nessie&quot;, but she broke.<br /><br />Should I name my mini-vape?&nbsp; Do people name vapes?

				I do edibles all the way now. Even thc smoke is bad for the lungs - vaping or edibles is the way to go nowadays. Plus, I can have a plastic container full of 500 doses of thc capsules in my freezer and nobody would be the wiser (except for LE with a search warrant of course...). Heck, I can even take my capsules to public places and around family and nobody is the wiser. I have named my capsules though, I call them &quot;coco caps&quot; because I use coconut oil as a solvent for the cannabinoids.

				Now that I realize it, I&#039;ve only named a pipe once and it was my first one ever a few years ago. It was a clear bubbler with some blue/white streaks all over, and a donut in the middle of it all. I named it Jesus James. <br /><br />RIP Jesus James

				Have you though of a name for you vaporizer? <br /><br />How do they compare to actually smoking? I know some people swear they get more high and others don&#039;t. I have tried a volcano a few times but was already pretty stoned so I can&#039;t really say personally.
