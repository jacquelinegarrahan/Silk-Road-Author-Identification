				hey there, I&#039;m all over the net trying to find an anonymous way to add my first Bitcoins into my SilkRoad wallet...<br />and I just came across the Bitcoin Fog website which i know most of you familiar with... but I didn&#039;t quite understood how it works. :-/<br /><br />so let me get this straight, and if I&#039;m wrong plz correct me...&nbsp; I can buy bitcoins at any website which offers bitcoins in exchange for money, even the ones which are NOT anonymous like this one right here:<br />https://www.bitgo.co.il/English.aspx<br />and deposit the Bitcoins I got into the address that they give you at Bitcoin Fog<br />and then, withdraw some of the bitcoins from Bitcoin fog into my SilkRoad wallet..<br />am I right? and is it really anonymous and secure to use this Method?<br /><br />thanks for all the answers<br />

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

Easy method. Using a REloadit card. Min amount: $300. Max : none<br />2. Slightly more difficult method.&nbsp; Using bitinstant and MtGox. Min amount : $20. Max amount : $500.<br /><br />The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />Order the free guide at:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/d05b9deccc<br /><br />The reason the guide has to be downloaded is that it is a PDF. It&#039;s clean, well-formatted, and as easy to follow as a recipe. If I were to post it on this forum, it would be a long and hard to follow.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not selling it; I&#039;m giving it away. It&#039;s a chicken-egg problem.

				Start small and simple. Take your SR # and try bitinstant. Just go fill out the forms to make your deposit, print out the form, go to the location for deposit you choose, go deposit say a 100 of whatever into the address, and in&nbsp; a short time you will find you have the bit you need where you need them. It will seem like a simple hassle once it works for you once. Note, this is going to cost you some small change to do, but it will be worth it. Take care and enjoy your journey on the SR, hope you have many blessed years of safe travel.

				I&#039;ve taken down my previous listing for the Bitcoin Guide, and replaced it with a new listing. Thanks Scintillation, et al, for your valuable input. All the info for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash is available free right in the listing itself:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download.

				Browsing via Tor keeps you safe and anonymous for most sites. <br /><br />***** HOWEVER, IT IS NOT SAFE TO ACCESS MT GOX THROUGH TOR. ********<br /><br />Doing so will cause Mt Gox to flag your account and force you to verify your identity. This happened to someone I know; here are excerpts of the note he received when he visited Mt. Gox through Tor (because of my failure to warn him to do otherwise, my bad!)<br /><br />&quot;Your account had been flagged for using services like TOR, VPN, or any public<br />networks to connect to our services without a &#039;verified&#039; account which is not<br />allowed on Mt.Gox.&nbsp; That is why you have to be verified. <br />...<br />Please note that using services like TOR, VPN, or any public networks where more than one user<br />have a shared IP address (Public school, University...) will automatically trigger an level 1<br />AML request from our side; this is in order to make sure that you are the owner of the account<br />you are trying to access. Once again, this AML system that has been put in place in order to<br />not only protect Mt. Gox from fraudulent activities but also to ultimately protect you and your assets.&quot;<br />

				Simply buy your Bitcoins at www.Bitcoin-Brokers.org <br /><br />Pay at MoneyGram with NO ID.<br /><br />Bitcoins are sold for 2% BELOW MtGox...cheaper than Bitinstant.<br /><br />Available in every country as compared to Bitinstant which is basically just for the USA.<br /><br />Additionally you can sell your Bitcoins back to Bitcoin-Brokers for a cash pick up at MoneyGram without needing to show ID...totally anonymous.<br />

				No one has really answered this question!<br /><br />What bitcoin fog do it take you coins and mix them with other peoples and then they slowly redistribute the coins back to you in different amounts that eventually add up to the amount that you originally put in (minus the fee of course) What this essentially does if give you back different coins to the one you bought meaning that they cant be traced back to yourself! It definitely does increase anonymity a great deal because everyone just has coins that have have all come from different locations!
