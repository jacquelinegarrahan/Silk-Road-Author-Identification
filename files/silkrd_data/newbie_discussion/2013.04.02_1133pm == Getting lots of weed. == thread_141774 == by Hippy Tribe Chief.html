				So, I been getting a fair amount of weed lately.&nbsp; QP&#039;s mostly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every few weeks, nothing too major.&nbsp; The vendors are the best of the best in regard to shipping.&nbsp; &nbsp;I may want to start getting a bit more.. HP and Pounds.&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone with experience getting this amount?&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been thinking about getting a separate clean ship house/ ship apartment.&nbsp; Of course other items besides weed will&nbsp; be shipped there, likely not in my name.&nbsp; I have to take measures to not get caught of course, so i don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea to have my name on utilities and water bill/electric, thus not finding any of my other location/s.&nbsp; <br /><br />The house is always clean, even if packet get seized.. whats the risk, with a GOOD lawyer?&nbsp; Will I get followed and investigated deeply?&nbsp; I won&#039;t be getting any more than a few pounds per month.&nbsp; Thoughts?

				I was under the impression using a fake name can be a red flag.<br /><br />A good enough lawyer will help you.&nbsp; But I would watch for signatures, it could be a controlled delivery. In that case NEVER sign for it, and there is no proof you knew about the package. <br /><br />Your not risking anymore buying a qp vs a pound.&nbsp; Either way your a dealer.

				Yes, please share! Ever since SDM vanished, I think quite a few people are at a loss as to where to go for their bulk weed needs.

				There&#039;s quite a few reputable bulk dealers here. Off the top of my head supercanna, lucymcgee, darkexpresso, Humboldtsfinest, WestCoastRx. There&#039;s also a new bulk dealer by the name of Kensho. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m forgetting a few.
