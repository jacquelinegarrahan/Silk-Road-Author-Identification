				Yeah I am pretty sure mollyfan means ug/drop not a vial with just 150ug lol youd be luck to even get the last few hundred mics outta a full vial. I understood what they meant.

				Unless you either busted the vial and tried to get to it and ended up cutting your tongue on the glass<br /><br />or<br /><br />diluted the 150ug of LSD and had a vial full of 8ug hits of acid <br />:x
