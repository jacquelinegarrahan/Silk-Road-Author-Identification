				Based on your experiences so far, what is the best(anonymity wise) way for receiving packages?<br /><br />I can have a PO Box to have things sent to which is not registered to my name but to a company with no personal name appearing on it, just the company title and details - I can receive things from the box without signing, just using company details.<br />The other option is again an address registered to a company but if i choose to have things sent there i&#039;ll have to use a name.<br /><br />What do you think?

				With having things delivered to your house you have plausible deniability.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s quite the same if they were to apprehend you after you go pick up packages from a P.O. Box.<br /><br />Hopefully someone else more knowledgeable in this area will chime in and comment.

				Yup, I read an article long time back where some guy got busted after he went into a post office to pick up a package.<br /><br />Was full of Xanax and things like that.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t SR-related though.<br /><br />I believe lots of places (especially the US) you can&#039;t open a P.O. Box without showing a valid government-issued ID.

				Well, in my place it;s a bit different with PO BOX.<br /><br />You dont need to present any sort of ID to take letters/items from the box unless sit is quite a big package which doesnt fit in the actual box.<br />Hopefully items sent through SR come in the size of an envelope which should fit in there.<br /><br />However, my point was merely on the fact that an anonymous PO box registered to someone else, from which a 3rd person picks mail,bills etc should be safer than let&#039;s say an address to a home with a fake name. Or not?

				Just order it to your home, under your real name - but make sure you get plenty of packages of places like, Ebay and Amazon. Makes the on-going steady package amount look less suspicious&nbsp; :)

				The best way is to order small amounts delivered in small packages or envelopes. Not only the delivery success rate is higher, it&#039;s also much less risky in case it gets found out.<br />Unless you require large amounts for reselling purposes etc then maybe someone more knowledgeable will help you.

				Well thing is i&#039;m kinda obligated to use a PO box due to where my house is...so it;s either a po box to my house or a po box to a company<br />for which my name need not be used...ofcourse as it was mentioned that probably makes no difference whatsoever...<br /><br />small quantities for sure and we&#039;ll see the results :)
