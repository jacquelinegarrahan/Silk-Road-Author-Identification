				Greetings <br />This is my first post.&nbsp; The emotions I am going through are making it hard to think clearly.<br />I want my first post to first offer my humblest commendation to someone that is rapidly changing consciousness. <br />He/she is an innovator, entrepreneur, liberator, and a little bit of a hero:<br /><br />You know the entity I am speaking of.&nbsp; Dread Pirate Roberts <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t the feeling of awe, inspiration, and excitement come over you as you log into these forums and the Silk Road.&nbsp; I know I do.&nbsp; I know when I read what Roberts quoted to the Forbes journalist, the words are almost divine.&nbsp; Roberts believes in Silk Road more than just a way to entertain people with controversial merchandise.<br />Roberts doesn&#039;t care about getting high.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Roberts barely imbibes alcohol.&nbsp; He is a self-proclaimed libertarian, now spiritually, true liberty is freedom from everything: tyranny, oppression, vice, disability, disease, hatred, envy, even freedom from feeling a need to use drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean sure, Roberts must feel absolutely great that Silk Road has become so successful and notorious at the same time. Look at the joy that Silk Road brings people.&nbsp; Sure the physical substance is great but it&#039;s more than that.&nbsp; It&#039;s a feeling of release that we don&#039;t have to meet a dealer to procure our drug of choice. <br /><br />Again it&#039;s not just the drug, it&#039;s empowering to be part of a community that doesn&#039;t just promise change like our politicians but actually just change it without hype.&nbsp; The revolution Silk Road started is not just for financial gain, revenge on big brother, or whatever.&nbsp; It&#039;s energy.&nbsp; Silk Road is changing the way people think, act, and interact with others.&nbsp; Now I am very very new to this whole thing, but there is genuine comradeship between the forum posters, moderators, vendors, buyers, bitcoin sellers, bloggers, even stupid journalists.&nbsp; There is respect.<br /><br />When a person chases a dream to the point of fruition like the Silk Road, u have to almost question if its divine or not.&nbsp; Human beings, characteristically, lack the basic&nbsp; knowledge, ambition, creativity, wisdom, courage, confidence, and intuition to create something like Silk Road.<br /><br />It just doesn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; But it did. And here it is!<br />Awesome.<br /><br />So as you are perusing your next transaction take a moment to feel gratitude towards Roberts.<br />When your purchase arrives safely in your hands, a ritualistic cheer should be in His/her honor.<br />The energy needs to stay positive.&nbsp; Universe feeds off energy and reciprocates it back to us.<br />Keep it positive and Silk Road will be here forever.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this if you took the time to.<br />
