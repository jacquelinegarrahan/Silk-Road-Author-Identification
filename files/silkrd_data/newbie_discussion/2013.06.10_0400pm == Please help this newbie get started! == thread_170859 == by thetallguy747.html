				This will probably be the most newbie of all newbie questions, but if any of you vets would help a rookie, I would appreciate the kindness!<br /><br />OK, I&#039;m sitting here with cash in hand.&nbsp; I want to be able to take the cash and send it (somwhere?) where it will get turned into bitcoins that will eventually allow me to send those bitcoins to my new SR account.<br /><br />What are the simple steps between sitting here cash in hand -- and having bitcoins in my SR account?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to figure this out on my own (the best way to learn) for days now but now I throw up my hands and ask for help from others willing to give it.<br /><br />Thanks!

				When it becomes available on the site again, use the cash deposit option to bitcoin address (SR wallet). Go to WalMart, fill out blue money gram form, pay and there you go.

				Someone posted in the forums that bitinstant wont be offering the cash deposit option anymore until there new site is up, which may take awhile. I emailed bitinstant to verify this and will post here when I get a reply. <br /><br />I too, am sitting cash in hand, waiting for bitinstand to fix this garbage so I can get some bitcoins.

				Hey there, Alex(not real name lol).<br /><br />We&#039;ve temporarily taken that functionality off of our site for system maintenance, and, unfortunately, we don&#039;t have an exact timeframe for when it will be restored. We are trying to bring it back as soon as possible. Please keep checking back if you&#039;d like to make a cash deposit transaction, and stay updated on Twitter @bitinstanthelp. We apologize for any inconvenience.<br />Best,<br /><br />Alyssa<br />Customer Service Manager, BitInstant

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />It describes more than one cash-to-bitcoin method, so it&#039;ll help you now that bitinstant&#039;s cash method is down til further notice.<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. If anyone has any corrections or info to add to the bitcoin guide, kindly pm MedicineWoman.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				You could log into SR and search for the vendor moneyhoney in the search box.&nbsp; They have a cash to bitcoin service they offer for 5% of the deposit amount.&nbsp; All you need to do is go to CVS or Walmart and get a green dot moneypak card (one with the scratch off number on the back).&nbsp; You hand cash to the teller and say load up the card with whatever cash you want to deposit and then send the information to moneyhoney and they&#039;ll transfer bitcoins to your SR account.&nbsp; All that is explained in more detail on moneyhoney&#039;s page on SR.&nbsp;

				MoneyHoney&#039;s SR page says he&#039;s not moving any product right now.&nbsp; But I did read his explanation -- very clear and sounds like a good alternative.

				holy crapppp this is frustrating. Medicine Womans 2nd method doesnt work right now since bitinstand is down, and the first method you need to be buying at-least 300 us dollars worth of bitcoins. I also checked localbitcoins and there are no places near me that can exchange money for bitcoins. <br /><br />FAWKK What to dooooooo

				I would suggest SR consider setting up its own exchange ?<br /><br />Many vendors where want cash for their coins.....many buyers want coins for their cash ?....<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t take a genius does it ?
