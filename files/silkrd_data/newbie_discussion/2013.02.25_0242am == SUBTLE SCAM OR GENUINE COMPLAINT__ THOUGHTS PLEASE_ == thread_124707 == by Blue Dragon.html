				Hi there,<br />Being a new vendor to this site, we know how important feedback and repeat business can be to the survival of the &quot;game&quot;<br />We take a lot of pride in our products, and as humans know that not everybody will be happy. Our philosophy is to strive for the best and keep our customers coming back for more.<br />A recent transaction has us contemplating whether we are a possible target for a scam. Tell us your thoughts or previous experiences please.<br />SCENARIO: :-\<br />Pleasant transaction between customer and vendor. Product delivered, outstanding review feedback given, (more than we could have asked for) 10 day after feedback left customer sends msg with complete opposite thought on product. stating product was not effective, and weak in nature. Statement of &quot;hate to talk bad about you guys&quot; and requesting vendor to rectify issue. <br />QUESTION: :-[<br />Our company policy is to ALWAYS test products before they are listed and or shipped. Every batch has to pass some standard quality testing. It is discerning to hear efficacy is an issue, though everyone reacts differently. SO, are we being scammed for xtra product? or is 10 days later still an appropriate complaint window? <br />We like to have faith in all of our transactions and our customers. Just not sure if motive is genuine. Any thoughts or opinions? possible similar experiences to share?<br />THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE

				What does he want $ back or more product he doesn&#039;t like? If you are confident in your product, I would tell him sorry and he should try another vendor. I had a guy just contact me and say his product was a no show, then I tracked and saw delivery days earlier. When I relayed this tracking info to him and I would not be giving refund he finalized. This all took place within 1/2 hr in messages go figure.

				If you are confident that your product was exactly what you said it was, then I would tactfully explain that and offer him another sample at your cost. That way in case it was an off day for him (for example, I&#039;ve gotten molly that I knew was pure and tried to roll when my tolerance was low and the circumstances just weren&#039;t right and my roll wasn&#039;t what it should have been.) and by offering him another sample at your cost, he get&#039;s a chance to see that your product was good and it doesn&#039;t cost you anything.<br /><br />Then if he complains again you can blacklist him or whatever and move on and if he doesn&#039;t, you might have gained yourself a faithful customer.<br /><br />

				Surely if you tested the product and it was good then he has no case,&nbsp; he finalised and gave you good feedback so its his problem surely?

				They are totally trying it on and given the scenario you have described and have zero credibility to back up any legitimate complaint.<br /><br />It&#039;s tough as a new vendor as one bad review can really sting but you can&#039;t allow yourself to be blackmailed by people like that.
