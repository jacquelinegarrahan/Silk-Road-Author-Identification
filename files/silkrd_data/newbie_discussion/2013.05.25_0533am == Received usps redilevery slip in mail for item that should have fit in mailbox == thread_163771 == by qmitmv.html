				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Long time buyer (over 50 purchases and over 1600 spent) first time poster.<br />I must say that I did UTFSE and found a few threads about slightly similar situations but none for an item of very small quantity that was first class and did not require signature.<br />I recently purchased 0.25 grams of a chemical substance from a member with high feedback.&nbsp; Today when I go to check my mail, I see not my package, but a &quot;sorry we have missed you&quot; usps slip.&nbsp; I find this odd for many reasons:<br /><br />First of all, the item should have been small enough to fit in my mailbox just like every single one of my other orders.<br /><br />Second, I was downstairs the entire time watching tv and never heard the postman knock.&nbsp; I had checked the mail at approx 1:30 and it was empty then checked again at about 1:50 and it had this slip in it.&nbsp; I had been downstairs the whole time.&nbsp; Even though I was watching tv, my room is close to the front door so I should have heard a knock, right?<br /><br />I believe I have covered everything.&nbsp; I did check the delivery confirmation number on the slip and it did reveal it was from the same state as the seller of the chemical, so I know it is for that item.<br /><br />I tried contacting the seller to no avail.&nbsp; I really need some suggestions please.&nbsp; I went online to the usps.com/redelivery section and told them to redeliver today and leave on porch.&nbsp; I will not sign anything.&nbsp; If the postman knocks on my door and wants me to sign and/or the package is clearly small enough to fit in my mailbox, I will tell them to return it to sender.<br /><br />I definitely would not walk into the post office to pick this up, although I am probably getting all worked up over nothing.&nbsp; For all&nbsp; I know the vendor shipped in a package too large to fit in my mailbox to make it superstealth.&nbsp; But why for such a small quantity?<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts.&nbsp; The item in question was for less than 50 bucks so it really isn&#039;t a loss.&nbsp; A question I have is would returning it to sender look suspicious?&nbsp; What about when it gets to the supposed sender which I assume is a fake return address and the post office then examines it to find the substance and sees my name written on the address label?&nbsp; I am an insanely paranoid person as it is so I could just be worrying over nothing.&nbsp; On many other threads they said that a controlled drop typically is done immediately and not for such a small amount of substance.&nbsp; Also they said that they typically don&#039;t leave a pink slip in the mailbox, that they would just come unexpectedly.<br /><br />Well sorry for the longwinded message, but I just worry.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you in advance for your suggestions on the matter.<br /><br /><br /><br />An

				That is true.&nbsp; I mean we all know anyone can send anyone anything in the mail, but I read if it is a controlled delivery and I accept, they will search my place.&nbsp; I have gotten rid of as much paraphernalia is possible, but it is not possible for me to eliminate all traces of substances from years past.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any drugs on the residence though, but if they swabbed down corners of the floor or backs of doors, they would find traces of numerous things.&nbsp; I also had some old straws and razorblades which I am not quite sure of how to dispose of other than just throwing in the trash.&nbsp; I had a scale, but I cleaned it thoroughly with rubbing alcohol.<br /><br />Of course, would they really waste their time for a personal use quantity? Or so I hope.&nbsp; And chances are it&#039;s nothing.&nbsp; I mean when I would order research chemicals, kratom, poppy pods, and Ether, I would frequently get these peach slips in the mail, with which I would go to the PO and pick it up, no problems.<br /><br />

				I had something similar just happen to me, and I posted about it. I read that you shouldnt be too concerned for having to sign as it can be an error from the vendor or even the post. specially if it goes a long way. I have the stuff here and im concerned i dont know where to put it tho.

				I think it&#039;s fine for you to mention them, I feel like that&#039;s the point of this forum.&nbsp; However I would wait a day to check if they have replied, I&#039;m sure some vendors check once or a few times a day to collect orders and such.&nbsp; The delivery mishap might even be chalked up to postman laziness.&nbsp; It could also be that the package is a weird shape that wouldn&#039;t fit.

				That could be it.&nbsp; I will say that on the vendor&#039;s feedback page people rave about his excellent stealth but also say that he never responds to messages.&nbsp; I hope his stealth is as excellent as they say.

				I&#039;m sure others agree he is stealthy that he wouldn&#039;t change from his normal packaging and slip up.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that his awesome packaging involves a large box with a vacuum sealed pouch within.&nbsp; The best shipments from SR that I&#039;ve received were package as such.

				I feel like you are fine, with that small amount I dont know who the fuck would be wasting their time on tryina bust you. BUT being paranoid is a good thing as I usually am too. Also, I have only gotten the peach slips from international orders, once from the UK, and once from India. And the funny thing is I went in to the PO without thinking twice about it to grab my 2 ounces of mephedrone crystals =p Lol probably should have been a bit more paranoid that day, but hey Im here right ;) But I really think you oughtta be aight, I am sure a 50 dollar baggie wouldnt even get noticed by L.E. by a long shot. Especially if the vendor is know for his stealth,

				Thanks for the posts.&nbsp; Yeah I will try to stop worrying; he probably just used a larger box to make it more stealth.&nbsp; Also I may have forgotten to mention earlier but the order is domestic and first class.&nbsp; I appreciate everyone&#039;s replies :) <br /><br />A 50 dollar bag is clearly for personal use so they shouldn&#039;t mess with it.<br /><br />Oh the peach slips refer to the usps redelivery slips that say on top &quot;sorry we missed you!&quot;

				Yeah I think you&#039;ll be fine to be honest. A redelivery notice isn&#039;t anything out of the ordinary, I&#039;d be more suspicious if they said you had to come in to pick up the package in person, you should be fine.

				Just wanted to update that I did get product delivered to my mailbox the next day after filling out online redelivery request without having to sign for it.&nbsp; Hopefully for anyone in a situation like mine, this will help to relieve your worrying.
