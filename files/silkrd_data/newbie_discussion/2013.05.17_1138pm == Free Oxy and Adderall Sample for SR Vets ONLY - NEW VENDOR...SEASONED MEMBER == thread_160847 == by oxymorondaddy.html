Since we have been loyal customers for a while...We are happy to start our venture &#039;on the other side&#039; of the &quot;road&quot;. We&#039;ve been purchasing our own wares here for seven months and developing our vendor system for the past 3 months to ensure timely service, quality product and consistency. <br /><br />So, to demonstrate our adherence to all that is right and good w/the SR, we are providing freebies to the first 10 members who have been a member for 3+ months; has at least 10 completed transactions; at least 10 buyer reviews posted on SR; and less than 5% auto-FEs. If you like our product we of course appreciate your feedback~!<br /><br />We wish to welcome all new and seasoned by offering some of the lowest introductory options for Oxy, Adderall and Fentanyl!<br />We price match +10% on all competitors offering the same (quality) products.<br /><br />We&#039;re looking forward to being a productive vendor here on SR. So, please view our vendor page at:<div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f128311def<br /></code>

				Hey oxy,<br /><br />I think I qualify as an SR Vet. I was just looking at your fent patches, but thought I&#039;d look around for some reviews on your business first. <br /><br />Luckily I found this free samples page! So how about a free fent (just a little piece) or oxy sample, and if all goes well I&#039;ll leave you a stellar review and swear to come back for one of those patches. <br /><br />PM on SR if you want. same name -- ornamentalist

				I PM&#039;ed him on SR and he straight up said &quot;no.&quot; to my request for the sample advertised here. I guess my purchasing stats aren&#039;t veteran enough, or he&#039;d rather sell his product than send it out for free (who can blame him?).<br /><br />If I can get another reply from him, I plan to order a fent patch and update here.<br /><br />
