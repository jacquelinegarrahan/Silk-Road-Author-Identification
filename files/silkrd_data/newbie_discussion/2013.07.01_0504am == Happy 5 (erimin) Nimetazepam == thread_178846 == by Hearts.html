				After stumbling across SR and having ordered a couple of times, I noticed that SR didn&#039;t have every drug imaginable, but there is a wide variety. I noticed there weren&#039;t any vendors selling &quot;Happy 5&quot;, something common in South east Asia, Its a cheap pill that gives a drunk like high (for me) and blurry vision. Its market brand name is Erimin. as wikipedia says, it is an intermediate-acting hypnotic drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. <br /><br />It is sold in 5 mg tablets known as Erimin. It is generally prescribed for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep.<br />Nimetazepam has a reputation in Malaysia for being particularly subject to abuse especially by persons addicted to amphetamines or opiates.<br /><br />heh maybe because I&#039;m from this shit country i&#039;ve seen it around... Since I moved out of my old town I was wondering where I could find these since I have no connects but SR... Anyone know if there are vendors selling Nimetazepam? Really because its cheap :\

				Silk road has a search feaure on the main site itself, not just the forum.<br /><br />According to the search engine unless your drug has any other names besides Erimin or Nimetazepam you&#039;re out of luck.<br /><br />You should look into different drugs which produce similar effects.

				Hey! just saw you on that spare bitcoins thread :) Yeah I did my search and couldn&#039;t find any results...<br />Looks like i&#039;ll have to do my research and look for alternatives, thanks! <br />And a pill here only costs around $3-5 last time I remembered

				Thanks VFF! I saw your thread not too long ago, all the best in getting your vendor status! At the moment I&#039;m out of bitcoins but i&#039;ll save some up and let you know if I&#039;d like to buy some! :) I don&#039;t think any other vendor sells them so you might be starting something ;) Cheers VFF
