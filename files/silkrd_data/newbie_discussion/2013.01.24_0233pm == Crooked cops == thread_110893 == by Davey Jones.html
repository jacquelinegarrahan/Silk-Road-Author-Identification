				Anyone got any good ones about crooked cops?&nbsp; I remember years ago having a local cop open up a side door of a van me and some mates were tokin some weed in, the ounce bag was right there.&nbsp; He wanted to know who&#039;s weed it was, no one said anything.&nbsp; Then after a minute or so I said, I dunno who&#039;s it is, but I know I don&#039;t want it, you can have it, just take it.&nbsp; You know what he did?&nbsp; He took the whole ounce, didn&#039;t even call it in.&nbsp; It was worth sacrificing that ounce.&nbsp; lol crooked cops, gotta love it.

				I know a guy got busted with 5 lbs of weed, it was all one package.&nbsp; When he went to court there was about a pound there as evidence he said, and it was all in individual quarter ounce baggies.&nbsp; Cops stole 4 lbs off him and kept it.&nbsp; It would be one thing if they just took his shit, but to rob him and bust him, thats just shabby.&nbsp; Even if they are crooked I still don&#039;t trust em.

				I had a friend who once got pulled over with 5 blunts rolled and one lit in his car. The cop simply asked what was in there. My friend said &quot;Tobacco&quot;. The cop apparently took them all, let him go with a warning, and told him to not be stupid about this kind of stuff.<br />

				The one thing I&#039;ve learned with cops is this, don&#039;t talk ever, and this happened this new years i was smoking out with my buds when we got searched they found hash and weed with us and we got taken to the police station drunk as fuck and on the newyears like 1am right after the big fireworks right along the beach, just imagine,it was my second time beeing busted but i didn&#039;t mind so I arrived there and immediately started asking for the cops to put handcuffs more loose immediately they started slapping me and kicking me for not calling them &quot;sir officer&quot; because of that i remembered the old saying never speak to the police and im my drunk mind i managed to keep quiet my other friends on the other hand kept talking in which the got more slaps and kicks after a while they started asking questions randomly to us that were sitting there i never said a thing but with my friends they got some answer and found out one of my friends was about to join the army, long story short they asked a lot of info to everyone and got their cellphones address and everything with me they got nothing just the basic id card thing i only got out with a mandatory visit to the drug addicts help service but i had to do community service since it was the second time and got away with just that , my other friends on the other hand was in a very risky position and still doesn&#039;t know if he can join the army, my other friends had to go to the drug addicts help center/service since it was their first time getting busted.<br /><br />SO remind yourself kids don&#039;t talk to the police they are not your friends, also thanks A LOT! silkroad community for that constant warning it helped me a lot ! :D<br />&nbsp;&lt;3 One love from europe.

				Lets just say there was this small town and small town cops too.&nbsp; But there was a big dealer in that town that brought in alot of blow.&nbsp; Well, obviously in a small town alot of people know alot of people and this particular cop would get paid 50kusd each time this guy would bring his blow in.&nbsp; Never were any problems with that whole police dept. like I said, gotta love it, but I still don&#039;t trust em.

				Absolute power corrupts absolutely so it&#039;s a given they have a certain % who are. Personally I grew up with a friend who&#039;s father was a cop in a large major city. We used to borrow from his shoe box in the closet filled with cash. When I told her we were crazy for taking this $ she said don&#039;t worry she heard her parents argue about it so what is he going to do as he stole it while on the job. I don&#039;t know how much there was in there but we would take $25-100 per week and she never got in trouble. The box was always full as well.

				Cops are normal people like everybody else. They need money just like everybody else. In some cities and states,&nbsp; the money police seize goes into their pension funds. With policies like that it&#039;s impossible to avoid corruption. There are miles of cases where LE raided someones house, seized everything, the charges were dropped, and none of the persons belongings were returned.

				How does all the shit somehow make it thru?&nbsp; Its the stuff everyone knows about but only a few are willing to talk about.&nbsp; Crooked cops, politicians, judges, thats the way it truly is.&nbsp; Paying off the right people, its like paying a toll, then off you go.
