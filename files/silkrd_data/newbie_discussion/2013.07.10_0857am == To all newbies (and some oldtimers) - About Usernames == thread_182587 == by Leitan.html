				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Today for the fourth time in a month i had to send a message to an user, because simply googling his username linked to a Google+ account with location and pictures.<br /><br />DO NOT USE YOUR REGULAR PSEUDONYM ON A HIDDEN SERVICE.<br /><br />It takes 15 secs to 5 minutes to link it to your regular identity for any LEO.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use either a name linkable to any of your close friends, relatives, old schoolmates..<br /><br />You can find plenty of names that are vague enough not to give any information on your person/location yet unique enough you could remember it !<br /><br />Take care,<br />Leitan

				Good advice when it comes to choosing monikers for the SR &amp; TOR. I thought along the same lines when I created mine.<br /><br />I just tried to come up with something unique &amp; clever.

				Ha ha, I have to admit that when I created my account, my instinct was to use the same old user name I use for everything.&nbsp; No way would I actually be that dumb though.&nbsp; Instead I just used the name of the song I was listening to at the time.
