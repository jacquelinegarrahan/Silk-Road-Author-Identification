				Has anyone seen the insane fluctuation today?<br /><br />I sent $227.33 to my SR address because I&#039;m purchasing $225 worth of stuff. I checked, and now 14.4576 (prob 14.46) BTC are being delivered to my SR address. That was $227 worth at 1pm today. Now, prices are so fucked up and my item is 14.99 BTC. WTF. So i deposited $227, and it devalued so by the time it&#039;ll hit my account it&#039;ll be like $220. I&#039;ll be 0.53 BTC short. :( :(<br /><br />Seriously BTC started at like 14.60 this morning and has gone as high as like 15.68. This is crazy.<br /><br />mtgoxlive.com has been non stop moving and I have never seen so many people selling BTC in comparison to buying. The ratio was all out of whack today.<br /><br />Can BTC really fuck up transactions like this? Just to be safe, I had deposited 240.95 but after fees it came down to $227.33, which was still $2.33 over. I thought I was golden, now I&#039;m not even close. What the fuck. How does one stop this from happening and ensure that your $227 (or any amount of $$$$) will come all in one piece?

				Are you saying that since the value of BTC went up...you can&#039;t buy what you want any more? Since what you have is now worth more..? I don&#039;t get it. The value SR uses for BTC has been steadily rising..

				I would wait, but in the future always make sure you pad your transaction to avoid stuff like this.&nbsp; If I am ordering something that is say 110 bucks I would make sure I put in 140 to take care of any transaction fee&#039;s and shipping and handling.&nbsp; Always pay close attention to those % fees the exchange your using tacks on as that is usually 4%(more or less depending on the exchange) taken off the top before your money ever even hits the market.&nbsp; Also, what ever is left over you can just apply to future transactions, and its bitcoin avail immediately so yay!&nbsp; :D<br />TinyDot

				give it a good hour before starting to get excited, then message SR Support.<br /><br />Honestly, in regards to your issue, I&#039;ve always waited till the last minute to purchase btc so they wouldn&#039;t devalue.&nbsp; Also, I always make sure to put enough btc in so that I&#039;ll end up with ~ 10% extra in my account for that very reason.&nbsp; A couple times It&#039;s been pretty close, but I&#039;ve NEVER been short.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a brighter note, my btc have increased by nearly 10% in the last 48-72 hours so there&#039;s a good chance if you chill and let it sit for a minute, you&#039;ll have enough for your purchase again.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m still confused as to what your problem is.&nbsp; BTC value has been rising, which means your 14.45 btc should be worth MORE now then they were in the last day or two, not LESS.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t understand the complaints. BTC has gone up dramatically in the last 48 hours. You really can&#039;t go wrong in this situation if your vendor has his prices locked to the USD (which almost all of us do).<br /><br />If you are buying coins as we speak then you may need to be careful. The climb hasn&#039;t peaked yet though...

				Oh definitely!&nbsp; It won&#039;t protect them from dropping in value if the market suddenly declines, but they wouldn&#039;t be safe from that anywhere.<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve had coins in the road for 5 days currently(though I generally try to spend them quickly to insulate against the possibility of deflation) I&#039;ve been on the road and forums for longer than most hero members and I haven&#039;t seen a SINGLE scenario where a person lost btc because they were on the road.&nbsp; The staff won&#039;t take them and they won&#039;t just disappear. :)

				I witnessed a 50k BTC transaction a few days ago at ~13.2... some BIG players are coming in and turning this into a profit war. BTC will rise and rise and then drop imho, hold your horses on the purchasing if you want to make an investment as it&#039;ll get to ~16 and then drop to 13-14 again.

				holy shit, if they bought at 13.2 that would&#039;ve been $660,000<br /><br />If they sold today at 15.6 they would&#039;ve made a $120K profit.

				Yep, that&#039;s how the dynamic of btc works.&nbsp; Super interesting.&nbsp; A person could get a bachelors degree studying only btc and still not know everything there is to know about them.<br /><br />not really, but just about.

There are two main factors that influence exchange rates in the real world. The first is interest rates. If interest rates move up 1 percent in UK then it is reasonable to assume that the USD/GPB rate will move up 1%, likely more but for this discussion we&#039;ll leave it at that. The reason being an increased return. If you can move your $100mil out of your US treasuries and into UK treasuries that are now yielding 1% more than you were getting in the states you will make the move. The second is future expectations or what traders believe governments and economies will do over the net 3, 6, 12, 24 months. <br /><br />So in effect there is zero reason to believe that there is a connect between the internet market and FX market. The only slight influences will be exchanges that offer USD/GBP, USD/EUR, EUR/GBP as well as currency to BTC. In my opinion as a trained economist and trader, this is a market that can be cornered. With lack of supply for inflating demand anyone with enough money in their pocket can essentially drive the BTC price through the roof by only purchasing. Their only risk would be a relaxation of mining rules and therefore an influx of new currency. In my mind it really wouldn&#039;t be worth the time as the transaction costs for BTC are exorbitant. But then again in the long run if the currency mint isn&#039;t ramped up you would be sitting on a pile of money. Unlikely though, fiat currency can be created by anyone and the BTC network is a brilliantly simple yet effective one that can be recreated.
