				So I am currently experiencing my 2nd bad/annoying experience in a row.&nbsp; The first was when Thurgood had the love letters go out, and had to cancel my order, so I decided to try MarleysMainMan.&nbsp; I ordered an 8th of his organic green crack, and waited and waited.&nbsp; Its been about 2 weeks and still no package, he responded to my message and asked if I wanted him to reship....Of course I want him to reship, is that even a question?&nbsp; I responded with a resounding YESSS, and no response, He hasnt even been logged on in 2 days.&nbsp; Im 6 days away from Auto-Finalize... Should I resolve this? Ive never had to do that before and have no idea how it works.&nbsp; What should I do?

				You just never know, I placed an order with a newer vendor and waited 14 days, it still hadn&#039;t shown up.&nbsp; I wrote the vendor and they couldn&#039;t locate the package via tracking, so just cancelled the order.&nbsp; Well, wouldn&#039;t you know it, the package showed up the very next day, so it took 15 days from intransit to reach my location, and this was domestic.&nbsp; The dates marked by USPS on the package confirmed when it had been shipped, and it indeed was in transit this long.&nbsp; Sometimes the mail system is just a mystery and it will still show up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve no experience with resolution yet, but if it were me I certainly wouldn&#039;t let it auto-finalize.&nbsp; I&#039;d click resolution a day or two before, explain the situation and suggest a few days extension just to make sure it doesn&#039;t show up.<br /><br />As an aside, and to plug one of my favorite vendors so far, check out TheDreamatorium for a future order.&nbsp; Product is very good and it&#039;s always made it to my mailbox within 4-5 days.&nbsp; Enjoy the road!

				I&#039;m sorry to hear that you&#039;re having trouble with MMM. He was great when I ordered from him (that green crack is AWESOME). If you go look at his profile, I don&#039;t think he even has any listing up at the moment, which makes me think he may have gone on some kind of hiatus...
