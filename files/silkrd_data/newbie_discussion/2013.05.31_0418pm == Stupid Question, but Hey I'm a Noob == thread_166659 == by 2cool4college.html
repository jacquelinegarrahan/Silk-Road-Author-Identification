				So, I&#039;ve already ordered a few things on the road. ID among one of them. But I was considering buying an eighth on the road because the selection around here sucks. Questions about it.<br /><br />For that amount, <br />1) Would it come in a letter?<br />2) If not, how is it delivered?

				Your best bet for those questions would be to Pm the Vendor and ask them direct. as every vendor is diffrent in packaging.&nbsp; &nbsp;ask if they use Mylar or douple bag or anything really if they have good stats they will be professional and help you with any questions.if it&#039;s a big amount it will very ect.

				It just so happens I am a vendor and am relaunching after vacation, my shipping is very stealth and currently I have AK47 (sativa).&nbsp; If you are interested in trying me out here is my vendor page<br /><br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/fce0038339

				Ask the vendor. For something that is pungent it is important. A good pre search would be to read the feedback, if you see consistent positive feedback as towards the Vendor&#039;s Stealth (Stealth being defined as their ability to properly conceal the payload from outside detection, dogs included) then it would be a good idea to delve further and message them directly and find out as other posters mentioned.

				Well, I understand the whole stealth thing. I&#039;ve done plenty of reading on that. I just was wondering about the actual...container? that it comes in. I.e. is it going to be in an envelope in my mail box or will I have a package at my door?

				Best thing you can do is use the search engine for these Forums . I don&#039;t know what your ordering an 1/8th of but the better&nbsp; vendors have their shipping shit down pretty well . Most everything I&#039;ve bought has come in an envelope, most in the larger express or priority kind, I&#039;ve got 1 that was in a priority box, but, all my orders have been packaged professional and just looked like mail....no major red flags. Remember, it&#039;s one parcel out of millions that move every day.

				My packaging consists of a double sealed vacuum bag which is then stored in a had cover to protect from detection and damage.&nbsp; It is standard from what i have seen from most vendors on here.
