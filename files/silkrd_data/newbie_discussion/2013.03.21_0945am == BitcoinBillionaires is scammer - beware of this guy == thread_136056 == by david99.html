				I&#039;m sorry to hear this, if you have been scammed by BitcoinBillionaires you need to hit the &#039;report this vendor&#039; link on his vendor&#039;s page asap to make admin aware of the situation, you won&#039;t be able to get your money back however you&#039;ll get the ball rolling in stopping this vendor from scamming others.

				Oh, he&#039;s the stupid one?<br /><br />If you&#039;ve been scammed by that idiot you deserve it. It was blatantly obvious that there was something shifty about him given how he kept on reposting the same poorly written advertisement/rhread on here. If you don&#039;t do your research you only have yourself to blame.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d have to agree and say do not order with this guy before people start reporting that they received Btc. <br /><br />Not exactly hopeful myself at this point.<br /><br />My advice is don&#039;t try and acquire Bitcoin with Ukash if you can possibly do it any other way at this time.

				Yep, complete scammer. If you are thinking about going with this guy for coins, simply do not. Shame as its my first time being scammed since being on here. <br /><br />Sent Ukash numbers two days ago and nothing. As per previous reports, very communicative up until he has your money, Then nothing. <br /><br />DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS GUY AT ALL
