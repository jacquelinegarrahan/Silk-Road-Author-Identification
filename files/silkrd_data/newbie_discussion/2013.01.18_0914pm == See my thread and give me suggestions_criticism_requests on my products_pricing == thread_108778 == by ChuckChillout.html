				I myself don&#039;t take pain meds or benzos, so I can&#039;t comment on the pricing or anything.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re looking to establish yourself, maybe try giving out small samples to a select amount of people and get thorough reviews in return from them.<br /><br />That&#039;s how many people start out, and it works great.

They are standard meds, I see no use. I can see samples of MDA, MDMA, LSD, Herion, Coke, Weed, etc...but not your standard fare<br />2. I Have a feeling that some people here get through life on samples, kinda bugs me.<br /><br />Thank you very much for the suggestion regardless.

				At launch, you need feedback quickly so typically free samples or intro pricing deals are used to get interest.&nbsp; Undercut, gain market share, then raise prices to normal.&nbsp; Think like Wal-Mart :)
