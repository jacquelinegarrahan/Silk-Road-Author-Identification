				Hey Travelers! New to the forums and to SR! Known about it for a long time, but not until recently have I dug deeper and finally actually made a purchase!<br /><br />Well, going through some things in the past few hours and I realized, my method of payment, BitInstant w/ ZipZap is down. Freaking out, because it&#039;s my only method, I think &quot;Wow, they shut it down. Crap. BS. Crap. WTF now, blah blah blah. Well emailed BI about ZipZap being down, and asked for any information, and a prompt reply was that it was down until Monday.<br /><br />Phew. Hopefully it comes back. When noticing that, SR was down (came upon DPR&#039;s post which cleared me), but with those 2 down i was like WTF, found a beautiful place, and 3 days later it&#039;s gone. All&#039;s well for now I suppose.

				About 12 hours ago I was able to select cash deposit thru bitinstant and immediately went to make the deposit. I came home ate some lunch, took a nap then checked the status update of my transaction and noticed after several attempts the transaction was cancelled...then noticed at the bottom of the screen it said cash deposits were down til for the weekend. I went to the support page on bitinstant and sent a request concerning the status of my transaction. Within 10 mins. I had a reply from their support team saying they she personally did a manual transaction and that my money was safe and in will be in my account shortly. Within 2 hours, there it was!

				Yeah, seems like localbitcoins is the only way to get anonymous USD cash into BTC at the moment. BST has been unavailable the last few days too.<br /><br />Everything should hopefully be back after the weekend.

				You can always make a new payment slip for bitinstant,&nbsp; The ones you already have expire in 120 hours from the time they were made and you are bound to nothing. Just make a new one(s) the day the site is back up :D

				I&#039;m kind of in the same boat as you.&nbsp; Coming back from a few months off and was just about to get some bitcoin to pick up some stuff and today&#039;s the day sr was down for maintenance and worse bitinstant is out of comish until Monday.&nbsp; Luckily there are some other ways to get bitcoin before then but it&#039;s going to cost me more.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t complete a transaction until it&#039;s back and running on their site. Seems fishy, wonder what they could be doing with ZipZap. Even the 3.99% conversion chart for ZipZap is down. Hopefully it comes back, and with no new strings. LocalBTC&#039;s nearest vend is like 150 miles away. FML and the boonies where my arse lives.<br /><br />Like I said, up to you, I am no one to make your decisions, but I&#039;d wait until Monday. If anyone does go through and process their ZZ ticket, let us know on time frames or any problems you may encounter.<br /><br />- InbetweenWaves
