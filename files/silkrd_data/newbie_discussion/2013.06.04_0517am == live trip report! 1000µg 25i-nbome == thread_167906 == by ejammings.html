				Purchased it from T5. Placed on my gum roughly 16 minutes ago. <br /><br />Not swallowing spit while awake for 16 minutes is currently my life&#039;s greatest accomplishment.<br /><br />Was going to say I&#039;d update when it hit me.<br />Buttt...<br /><br />0h:17m -&nbsp; Small visual effect. Computer monitor looks strange in the way it&#039;s &quot;lighting.&quot; Cool cool can&#039;t wait till it really kicks in.<br /><br />0h:39m - Smoke vision is the best way to describe what was happening before. Still happening. Tongue is numb like I just sucked a ton of sour candies clean.&nbsp; Jumping in the shower hopefully it doesn&#039;t kick in too much :)<br /><br />1h:00m - My shower took a long time. Had &quot;highdef&quot; vision as I&#039;m familiar with from using Mushrooms(most I&#039;ve used is 3g)<br /><br />1:04- My ability to spell seems to have diminished. Thank you auto correct. Insane color visuals. Turning on latest queens of the stoneage album. <br /><br />I repeat insane COLOR visuals. Fading and going and coming back stronger etc. <br /><br />2:00 - You wouldn&#039;t believe me.

				So far I recommend this as a &quot;trip&quot; drug not something to go to a concert with. This is a stay at home and enjoy yourself thing. Unless you like to be on your own when you are around others in the sense that you don&#039;t give a crap like me.

				Got a couple questions for you guys...<br /><br />Is this cross tolerant with any other psychs? How often should you take it? If I could dose LSD daily. I would. I hate being sober.<br /><br />If I can use this more frequently than LSD and shrooms, I&#039;m getting some. I&#039;ve never tried it, but... well... who knows.<br /><br />Also, which is the best, in your guy&#039;s opinions? Thanks! <br /><br />Looking forward to reading the rest of the trip report. If you keep updating, I&#039;ll stay here until you&#039;re done. This is awesome. Thank you for posting this.<br /><br />Ah, you give up. Haha. Well, enjoy.

				Good to know. I also have some shrooms, x and lsd. Used to do lots of cid but never tried any of the other three. But I like to get in my head on acid, so I was going to save that for a friendly gathering versus a crowd.

				I feel like I picked the wrong album for this trip. The evil sounds from this shit is definitely shaping my ultimately AMAZING TRIP.<br />The only way to explain it would be by dosing you with this stuff. And experiencing it.<br /><br />Way better than shrooms or mdma or weed or alcohol.. <br /><br />This is just bliss. Pure bliss. Worried about the comedown I&#039;ll let you guys know

				Yep, NBOMEs are best enjoyed at home, alone, as the body load can be quite overwhelming and i would hate to be tripping on this in public.<br /><br />I tried some 25B-NBOME from T5 @ 1mg and had very harsh nausea, but i did swallow my saliva.. sorry if my question is dumb, but is it related?<br />The trip was enjoyable, but the nausea keeps me from doing it again.. Do you guys have any trick to fight the nausea during coming up? I use Bismuth before dosing and Cannabis and ginger candies all throughout the trip, but it&#039;s not enough.<br /><br />I gave some to my friend to try and he didn&#039;t report any nausea and had a solid trip, could it be that i&#039;m just sensible?<br /><br />Also, would i be better with 25I-NBOME? Anyone can compare the two of them?<br /><br />Hope you have fun, ejammings, don&#039;t forget to put on some music, especially some you don&#039;t know very well, you&#039;re probably going to discover something great! Both my friend and i had major musical discoveries while on NBOME..!

				25I is amazing but is not something someone can easily function on. I remeber my first trip was same dosage, first psychedelic other then mushrooms and i only had used them twice, straight tripping face for me i was entirely unable to function behind a computer, walking and moving around wasent challenging but i sure didn&#039;t take the easy way around my house. Made pizza no problem, but when i tried to eat it my gums/teeth/lips all felt fused together when i chewed like i was chewing them off. Smoking weed is more then encouraged in my opinion! It was amazing, instantly kicks it up a notch and always feels so smooth. Vasioconstriction got pretty bad at about halfway and remained until well after i came down. Mainly felt it in my thighs and came to a nearly painful point if i remained standing for extended periods. <br /><br />Sound similar to anyone else familiar with the drug? Ive tripped 15+ Times since my first, all effects all the same but i cant handle myself better now, highest dosage to date was 4 1000ug tabs or 4mg consumed at once. Now that was something else, universe splitting.<br /><br />Don&#039;t trip again for at least 3-7 days depending on how impatient you are. Tripping the day after requires at least double the dosage for smiler, less profound effects. Cannot reach the same peak if you frequently trip without breaks in my opinion.

				I did NBOME a few weeks ago, at an undergrown rave in LA, there was a few hundred people. it was fucking magical, I didn&#039;t care that I was in public. The people, the energy, the music and the feelings were incredible. I had visuals that lasted a good 8-10 hours, the body high was euphoric, bliss. <br />I&#039;ve done LSD, Shrooms, Moonrocks, MDA, and a whole slew of other drugs, and NBome was up there with the most euphoric experiences yet.<br />

				I have had 25i and 25c nbomes many many times, and find the BEST way to take it, without any taste, for a super fast come up, is to take a tab, and put it into your nose, against the middle of your nose. Trust me, put it there, it wont fall out, it cant be seen by anyone and after about a minute you forget its there. You WILL be tripping balls in about 15 minutes.

				I read on here so far that people are enjoying this stuff.&nbsp; I tried 1.5 mg of 25c from silo quite a while ago.&nbsp; got some interesting visuals, almost mescaline based, was really cool.&nbsp; I was stupid and 2 days later tried 1mg of righteous 25i, felt little of nothing really.&nbsp; Then I realized you arent supposed to dose like that.&nbsp; So I didnt.&nbsp; About a week and half later I dosed 1 tab of real L from TheDrugFederation and it was great.&nbsp; Now I just acquired more nbomes 1000ug from Righteous and debating on giving it a shot once again.<br /><br />Is nbome something that I can take at at home in my room while listening to music and being on the computer and still enjoy it or is it something where Id rather be outside and in the sunlight?<br /><br />Any advice is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Im very hesitant on these new rc&#039;s and what they can do.&nbsp; I have tried 2ce and 2ci, Dox compounds (didnt like those), Shrooms (used to grow them years ago) rolled plenty of times.&nbsp; successfully tripped on real L now 3 times.<br /><br />What would be the right setting for nbome?

				It&#039;s something you can take in your room and just trip time away. Or you can go outside and have picnic!<br /><br />I recommend no lights and just music and a big glass of water for a trip session. Close your eyes and let it take you where ever it takes you. 1mg is very mild and will allow you to control the situation or adjust.<br /><br />I blacked out last night with 2mg of 25i and 6 bowls of weed. Woke up in a hospital, was found barefoot on a main avenue complaining about birds. Try not mixing and lock yourself in! I don&#039;t know why or how I left my apartment.
