				Hello All- I am a relatively new member to SR, and I wanted to get the communities feedback on an order I have made. <br /><br />I made an order from a new vendor,&nbsp; who was looking to increase their stats. There is no FE required with the order, but upon shipment the seller stated (without previous provocation or questioning) &quot;remember there are no full refund regardless of buyer stats&quot;<br /><br />He sent the shipment first class mail last week Thursday. I have not seen anything as of yet, should i be worried based on that initial response? <br /><br />Also I have messged the vendor twice over 4 days and have not gotten a response. What are your thoughts?<br /><br />Do new vendors set up listings, create an arbitrary refund %, and then if it goes to resolution they will win because they had previously stated a refund %? basically because they wrote 40% refund only?<br /><br />Thanks for any opinions.<br /><br />J

				No i have not finalized.<br /><br />I am worried that because in the listing he says 40% refund only. Even if i dispute do I de facto lose 60% of my money, because he had written in the listing 40% refund only?

				Here----http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=The_ordering_process<br /><br />I&#039;ve never gone to the resolution center so I can&#039;t offer too much in site, but it&#039;s good that you didn&#039;t finalize. It usually depends on your buyer stats and the vendors reputation...but if you guys can&#039;t agree on a refund then the admins decide.

				I&#039;d be patient. It seems it&#039;s only been a week, so it may show up.

				If your order does go to resolution because the order never arrives, either you or the vendor indicate what % of a refund you will be getting.&nbsp; If you propose 75% the vendor can either accept it or reply back with a lower % refund.&nbsp; This goes on until you both agree on a number.<br /><br />If you cannot agree on a number and it ends up going to SR, unless there are unusual circumstances, they will usually go with the refund % that the vendor states on their profile.&nbsp; If the vendor has no stated refund policy SR will probably go 50/50 unless they believe the vendor scammed you. Simply not receiving an order that wasn&#039;t tracked isn&#039;t enough to say that the vendor was scamming you.<br /><br />To be honest, you should always go with tracking, it&#039;s better for both parties.
