				Although being new to SR forums Ive been on the road for over a year now- ironically....Ive never resorted to the forums but ...I must sing the praise of MAHAKALA...Ive ordered from this vendor many times, as well as, many other vendors in his field but he really provides the most beautiful and enlightening experiences--each one of his treats has yielded a wonderful experience...never a bad vibe or aura...when I first encountered his page - I was getting back into psychedelics after a long period of using hard drugs....I decided to use psychedelics as a vehicle for growth as opposed to other drugs which -in my case- just led to total misery. anyways, I visited his page and he claims his product are &#039;blessed&#039; and at first - cynical- as I am..I thought it was just another selling point but...it isnt gimmick...they are indeed magical!!&nbsp; I cherish each experience he has provided...Mahakala..the great protector delivers the goods.... just give it a try and you shall see &lt;3&nbsp; ( he sells individual candies that are glorious--sugary, sour candies that kick in almost immediately )

				I ordered 250mg of 2C-B from him, and though I havnt had a chance to try it (weighing 2c-b is fucking difficult with a shitty mg scale, i need more practice) he had the absolute best stealth Ive ever seen! He also put in an empty blotter sheet with a stamped image of Mahakala the diety. It was a very cool little addition to the order.

				Yes..those little touches go a long way...at first It was hard to choose a solid vendor for psychedelics--it seems like most people comment mostly on the speed and arrival of package but never the quality...and never report back-- so I ventured out to the top ones first and then tried MAHAKALA.... the candy was my first and the euphoria was comparable to clean MDMDA -- his dali lamas are excellent as well...the cleanest-purest stuff ive ever tried...there are others like tessellated that deliver the goods but without the consistency of MAHAKALA--sometimes i get brutally depressed on LSD and with him its yet to happen- its more like a miracle....really. plus theres something about him...seems like hes genuinely spreading knowledge and goodwill...i sound like a mahakala groupie...apologies. for a huge period there I strayed about from psychedelics after countless shitty experiences with the drug....until i tip toed back in and its helped me overcome so much in my life. it really does open doors-insights and a wealth of wonderful experiences. continue to spread the good word!

And then if I wanted to sell 2c-b to friends or give them away in capsules, how would I do this? I assume I can take the product and dry it out, then scrape the residue. Sounds like a lot of work but Ill give it a shot.

I did once order 200mg DMT from another vendor here famous for professional shipping and good product, and when it arrived I had to laugh as a release of nervous tension but also because it would pass any scrutiny a letter envelope could possibly face. Now I hear a lot about mahakalas&#039; professional shipping practices so I&#039;m seriously considering my first &quot;powder purchase&quot;.

				Does anyone have any idea when will he be back? I&#039;ve been waiting for what seems like a million years, and there doesn&#039;t seem to be anyone else selling 2C-B powder from Europe at the moment (there&#039;s love but they only have 100mg listings, and there&#039;s alkaloyd but they&#039;re from the US, which is not ideal...)
