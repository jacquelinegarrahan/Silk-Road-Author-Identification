				I transferred $450 into MtGox. When I went to log in to convert the money to BC, my password wouldn&#039;t work. I had a link for a new password sent to me -- right when Tormail went down last week. Since I couldn&#039;t access Tormail, I couldn&#039;t get the new password link for several days.<br /><br />When Tormail finally went back up, I reset my password and logged into MtGox ... and found my money was gone. The account history says the money was withdrawn during the time that I couldn&#039;t get into the account.<br /><br />Mtgox says that there&#039;s nothing they can do (but that I should change my password -- no kidding).<br /><br />I guess the money is gone, but does anyone have any insight into the situation? Should I stop using MtGox? How did this happen? (My password was a strong one, for whatever that&#039;s worth.)

				That&#039;s very unfortunate. If your Tormail account was untouched then it sounds like the person may have known that you had money in Mt. Gox. Did anybody have the opportunity to install a keylogger on your machine?<br /><br />That or it could be a successful phishing attempt. It&#039;s hard to tell for sure though. <br /><br />My personal advice would be to stay away from Mt. Gox at least. I&#039;ve known people to have money go missing for weeks in their system, only to reappear for no apparent reason. Using &quot;instant&quot; services and blockchain.info for my wallet has proven to be a very convenient system for me so far.

				That sucks ass.<br /><br />How&#039;s everyone else getting their coin these days?<br /><br />I try to stay away from Gox because of their ban on Tor use.<br /><br />BitInstant&#039;s coin to email is OK, but I have to spread my deposits over two days because of transaction limits. When btc rates are highly volatile, I get fucked over (The value of btc almost always falls and never rises when it happens to me -- I have bad luck I guess).<br /><br />Other than local, how else are people getting btc?<br /><br />I also read something about MtGox&#039;s US operations being handled by an actual US bank know, so I fear the FINCEN, KYC, etc. policies are going to be even more strictly enforced than they are now.<br /><br />Back when I was using dwolla (over a year ago), they froze a huge chunk of USD that I was trying to transfer back to Dwolla. Dwolla had changed their TOS and started requiring that anyone transferring funds to or from MtGox had to be verified by Gox. They never bothered to notify anyone.<br /><br />I sent a copy of my passport. I had just renewed it that month and had forgotten to sign it, so they refused to verify me. I tried sending a copy of my digital driver&#039;s license and a bill with my address, and they still wouldn&#039;t take them because I sent an unsigned copy of my passport. They wanted me to send notarized copies of my ID with this long explanation of what I was using them to verify that also needed to be notarized. They wanted me to mail these to Japan.<br /><br />I balked because I wasn&#039;t going through the expense of all that and I wasn&#039;t about to explain to my local notary about what MtGox is and what btc is. I also refused because I had sent ample ID.<br /><br />They had over $1000 USD frozen, so I couldn&#039;t let it go. It was a huge fucking risk sending all that shit in. I was shitting bricks.<br /><br />After 6 weeks of politely refusing and demanding they return my money, they finally unfroze them and returned them to my Gox account. I bought coin and started using a new account, but that still worries me.<br /><br />If anyone has a viable alternative (local is not an option in my area and I&#039;m not depositing funds into a stranger&#039;s bank account who is not running a legitimate business), I&#039;d love to hear it.
