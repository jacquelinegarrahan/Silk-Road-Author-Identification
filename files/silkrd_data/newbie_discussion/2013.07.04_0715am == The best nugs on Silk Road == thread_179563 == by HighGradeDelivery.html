				HighGradeDelivery&#039;s buds are the best I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; They are top grade medical marijuana that are well trimmed in my batches, and of superb quality.&nbsp; I frequently visit Northern California and Amsterdam,&nbsp; &nbsp;and have never had better smoke!&nbsp; I highly recommend this seller to all real cannabis aficionados.

				These are buyer submitted photos, after it was shipped, packaged and safely delivered.<br />I did not take these photos, the buyer did. I&#039;d like to think this is a solid contentment to my<br />herb quality. I think SR needs a cannabis cup with some objective judging. Far to often I<br />see listings labeled &quot;medical&quot; and the images are clearly greenhouse and/or outdoor. I&#039;m<br />not accusing anyone in particular, it&#039;s simply just happening.<br /><br />Check these pics out: http://imgur.com/a/Acbwu#5

				There should be some type of consensus/review thread, and maybe a testing thread where vendors send out a small sample to labs. Personally I only want to buy the best quality strains I can get, and it&#039;d be an interesting vendor competition. Maybe have a contest and a cannabis cup winner who receives some type of medal you see when searching bud.

				Just took a look at the pics AdaParcel. Definitely quality green and definitely better the most of the &quot;premium&quot; cannabis sold on this site. You may have a new customer in the near future. ;D

				Thanks!
