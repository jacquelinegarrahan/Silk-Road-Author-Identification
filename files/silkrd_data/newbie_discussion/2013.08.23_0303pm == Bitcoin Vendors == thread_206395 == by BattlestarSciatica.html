				BitcoinDeal. Hes a great vendor. It takes him a few days to get the coins but he comes through. I&#039;ve been working with him for a few months.

				I have been trolling this site for months reading tons of forums and have been paranoid about the whole process. Two issues that have scared me off more than once was the bitcoin hoops you have to jump through and worried about stealth shipping.<br /><br />I found a guy, bankobits, I sent money via WU and within three hours I had bitcoins in my SR account. I was worried about getting ripped but it was smooth as silk. You can contact him and he will give the WU instructions you can only do $299 per transaction but is no hassle and it worked. <br /><br />my rate of coin was 114.23 not the highest rate I saw but fair IMO. This was my first transaction on this site and has given me faith that this site is legit. <br /><br />Now to find a vendor :)
