				I will, give you a brief summary of which way to go, in your hunt for coin..<br /><br />but, like i tell all the newbs making threads with out even trying to read.<br /><br />Ever question that&nbsp; you,&nbsp; or any other new member can fathom, has not only been asked a million times before, but has also been answered.<br /><br />USE THE SEARCH ENGINE!<br /><br />&nbsp;Use bitinstant, pay a a money gram kiosk machine, use bogus info..wait till block chain confirms your transaction, buy acid.. done and done.

				To help out newbs, I wrote up a simple guide for ANONYMOUSLY buying bitcoins using cash, and transferring to the Road:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2f9f85aa35<br /><br />There is nothing to buy, and nothing to download. The guide is designed for buyers, not vendors, and it assumes no previous knowledge or computer skill.<br /><br />View the information for free, and if moved, donate!<br /><br />The bitcoin scene changes frequently. By putting this info in a listing, I can update it in one place rather than in many forum posts. <br /><br />Enjoy,<br />MedicineWoman<br />

				use bitinstant and all you have to do is deposit cash at a local walmart or a list of stores that provide the service.&nbsp; Then it will automatically transfer to your mtgox account (if thats the site you use, I use it and its very easy.)&nbsp; Then once the moneys into your mtgox account type your sr account number into the mtgox blank area where it says send bitcoins.&nbsp; Or you can send it to an ewallet first then to your SR account to make it even harder to trace.
