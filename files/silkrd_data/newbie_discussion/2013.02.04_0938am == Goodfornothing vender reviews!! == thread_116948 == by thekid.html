				From his vendor comments, it looks like he can improve on his stealth for international. Hopefully he takes steps towards that.<br />His prices are appealing, definitely!<br />I ordered a gram&nbsp; and the envelope was hand printed. It would have been good to have something a bit more professional looking. The product looked and tested great though, I think I will scrape up some more coins for a 5g or 10g order.<br />Communication was very good, and he answered all of my questions to my satisfaction.

				I ordered the &quot;White&quot; mdma but by the time my order went in it was sold out, so I received the &quot;eggshell&quot;. It was pulverized into loose grey powder. Waiting on friend&#039;s reports (i didn&#039;t sample it myself), but Marquis reagent tested straight to black with a bit of fizz/smoke, so I think you will be safe.<br />Can&#039;t speak to his other batches though.<br /><br />hope this helps. if you order, please update! I will update when my friends have sampled the gear as well.<br /><br /><br />

				People seemed to like the stuff, so I went ahead with a 10g order. I FE&#039;d, which is usually not recommended, but I received it in 4 business days, over weight, so that it good. Glad he is now in stealth mode pulling his stuff together rather than over extending himself.

				I got a 50g order on. Appeared good at first but after .2 testing I think it is cut with or is MDEA. Passed reagent test but so does all MDxx. Its intense short lived and not very lovey. I can&#039;t say for sure though anyone else have issues?

				i dont know if its been cut because i ate 3 of these 2 weeks ago at about .135 or so and i was rolling balls with my girl for a good amount of time and i used to roll alot. but i think it is good MDMA and also i was talking to someone on the road he washed a gram and i belive if i remember right it came back .8 so that would be 80% pure MDMA so with those numbers i dont think he could put MDxx in it or anything?

				got you. i thought the wash was to see the percent of purity from some of the things that i was reading up on. MDMA is not one of my topics that i know by hart would love to learn about them like i have with growing &quot;medical marijuana&quot; in clinic i used to work with

				Hey, question for Crack Fox and thekid because you two seem to be the bulk mdma buyers from this guy. Are you guys getting it through to the USA or are you located elsewhere? Also how long does he usually take. I want to try him out before he goes on vacation.

				GFN is the man! Got a sample 10g of MDA to the US, came within two weeks. Stealth could be better but hey, it got here so I&#039;m not gonna complain. I FE&#039;d but was not worried as I saw he has some pretty good reviews. Product came in very, very, very, very overweight, so much so&nbsp; that I almost think the vendor made a mistake! Looks to be very pure, whole solid rock. I have never seen MDA in crystal form only powder, so this is a first for me. Passed the marquis test, instantly went purple-black. Looks to be very clean, no visible color impurities. Will report back on the quality as I will have a test run with 4 people tonight.
