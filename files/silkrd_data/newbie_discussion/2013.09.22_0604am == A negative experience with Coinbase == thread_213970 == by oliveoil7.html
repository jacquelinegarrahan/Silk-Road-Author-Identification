				I purchased my first bitcoins through coinbase. I&#039;ve kept using this method to get coins despite the 4-5 day wait to receive your coins because it was simple and I was too lazy to find a better method. However, my last transaction will keep me from EVER using this method again! So here&#039;s what happened:<br /><br />I purchased 2 bitcoins and waited 4 days for them. During those 4 days, bitcoins jumped in price by over $30, and I would have made $60 in profit from the price fluctuation! Minutes before my transaction was due, they cancelled my order claiming that it was a security precaution they take. Here is the answer they gave me for my complaint, <br /><br />&quot;Because of the inherent risks that accompany selling bitcoin (an irreversible payment system) with traditional payment methods (which are reversible), we use machine learning algorithms to determine the probability of a purchase being fraudulent. We do this for the protection of consumers and Coinbase alike. &quot;<br /><br />I smell bull on that. So I am just giving an FYI and a warning to my fellow noobs who are thinking of using coinbase. I now use localbitcoins. Although the selling prices of coins are higher, localbitcoins provides an instantaneous transaction, and it is more anonymous than coinbase.
