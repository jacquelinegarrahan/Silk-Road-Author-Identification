				Lots of bit Coin scams on the road lately.&nbsp; Vendors with legit account too.&nbsp; <br />What assurances can you give to anyone ordering with a bank transfer?<br /><br />I ask because The last scam took someone for only $100.&nbsp; The vendor account cost $500.&nbsp; He did it a few times before getting caught and made some profit.&nbsp; The sad part is by the time people figure it out , the vendor already is ahead profit wise.&nbsp; The feedback was all FE.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I only ask these things for the sake of beginners and curious about yu accepting a bank transfer for BTC and also selling coke at the same time.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t this give your bank account details to a buyer and vice versa?&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s against the rules, by who cares .&nbsp; <br /><br />It would be neat to see you stay in escrow until the order is complete.&nbsp; Then no worries At all for the buyer.<br /><br /><br />Cool,&nbsp; glad to see more vendors and I hope business goes well for you.<br />

				Hi there, yes unfortunately there has always been scams on the road since the beginning even with legit long term vendors. Im a new vendor but hopefully i will gain some trust. :)<br /><br />Im happy to stay in escrow thats what its for, i will never ask to FE<br /><br />My bank account ( one of several ) is anonymous and i think if people are ok to give their address away for orders im sure giving their bank details away is fine. If not they can deposit to my account of an exchange site, keeping themselves anonymous.<br /><br />I hope this helped with some of your concerns :)<br /><br />**will be next week when cocaine is for sale hopefully<br />Kind Regards<br /><br />Bitcoin Billionaires<br />

				You know you can trust a man who sells cocaine and meth to handle your bitcoin conversions. <br /><br />It is non negotiable for me that when I do traceable clear net transactions to purchase bitcoins, the seller must also sell illegal drugs.<br /><br />Especially when I transfer it by cash/credit card linked to my name into his easily audited bank account. <br /><br />I am also a fucking shit for brains retard who was born yesterday. <br /><br />Use Blueskytraders. It&#039;s here for a reason.&nbsp; http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9f0dd63e28
