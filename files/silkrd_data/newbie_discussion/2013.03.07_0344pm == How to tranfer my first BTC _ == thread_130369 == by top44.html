				So i am one step&nbsp; before buying my first BTC from bitcoin-24.com. I have the following query:&nbsp; Is it wise to move the BTC from bitcoin-24.com to my digital official wallet , Bitcoin-QT,&nbsp; and THEN to the SR wallet??? , or should i transfer them directly from bitcoin-24.com to the SR wallet?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is it safe??? thanks in advance for any replies

				It Depends,<br /><br />I like to ONLY send SR my BTC when ordering..if not i hold it in my Wallet....<br /><br />BUT if you are looking to order ASAP, then sending it directly to SR would save you time and a small fee. (very small like .00005 btc)....<br /><br />Remember, it takes time to &quot;confirm&quot; the bitcoin transaction, could be 10 minutes, could be 3 hours. So if u need something quick obviously its easier to go right to SR&#039;s wallet because its only 1 transaction. <br /><br />Never share your SR pin, and NEVER sign in with it. The sign in&#039;s with the pin are phishing scams.

				It&#039;s pretty damn safe to do in my opinion, so long as you trust the tumbling service providing to you by the SR. I&#039;m just in the process of transferring coins to my account for the first time, but I don&#039;t think adding another layer is really necessary.

There is still that very tiny risk for SR servers to be seized one day. Even if they do, that must be encrypted. But are all BTC wallets&nbsp; used by SR completely hidden ? Are transactions logged ? This part is quite obscure and you got to know that a direct transfer to SR could in the future an incremenating thing.<br /><br />Be proportional. If you are ordering thousands of $ of merch on SR, then you need top notch security all around. If you just order every two months small amounts of W, then maybe you don&#039;t need so much of the above.<br /><br />If someone knows an easy to use/free tumbler to put between your BTC source and SR I would love to know it&#039;s URL !
