				Searched around the forums didn&#039;t see anyone posting about CousinMolly, so I thought I&#039;d throw this up here.<br /><br />Tan Rock MDMA<br />•Quality of service - Excellent 5/5<br />•Response time to messages - Very fast, usually with the hour.<br />•Delivery time - 2 days for Central US Domestic<br />•Professionalism of communications - Great<br />•Quality of packaging (NOT THE APPEARANCE!) - /5 While the outer packing was great, the product was single bagged and taped in place, potential for bag tearing if not careful when removing the tape.<br />•Quality of product - Looks beautiful, like a MDMA version of rocky road. Will update after full testing/trial.<br />•Overall experience - Looks great, quick shipping. Was sketchy about the FE for a new vendor, but it looks like I&#039;ll probably be ordering from CousinMolly again in the future. Full report on the product when tested.<br /><br />I&#039;ll test this tonight, and should have a product update by tomorrow sometime.<br /><br />

				Sorry for the long delay on the quality, I updated the feedback, but forgot to update this one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Quality of his stuff was great.&nbsp; I packaged several ..1 gm capsules and handed them out to about 10 friends.&nbsp; Giving each a few so that if necessary they could redose in case the original wasn&#039;t enough.&nbsp; Locally, nobody trusts anything in caps (too easy to dilute or adulterate) and pressed pills have been crap for the last couple of years.&nbsp; Everybody was extremely happy to finally be able to take quality stuff.&nbsp; I had people calling in sick to work the next day so that they could keep partying. EXCELLENT product, will definitely be using him as a domestic source for MDMA.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve ordered a test kit, but am still waiting for it to be delivered.

				Most were very happy with the .1 gm.&nbsp; They would usually take another .1 g 2-3 hours after the initial dosing.&nbsp; I&#039;m a jaded and experienced user (plus physically large at 250lbs), and I was having a blast at .15 g each dosing.

				I have made two purchases on the Road and refuse to FE.&nbsp; For every seller that requires FE one doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; It should be a policy that under certain weights a vendor cannot ask for FE.&nbsp; As one poster put it, whats the point of escrow if a vendor requires FE.&nbsp; Also another good point about paying a premium for non-FEing vendors is complete bullshit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve paid the same exact price for Molly from a vendor that does not require FE as one that does.&nbsp; Do your research, stay away from vendors that require FE unless there is no there way, because at one point you will get scammed.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I ordered .5g on Monday morning, and it was waiting for&nbsp; me when I got home from work today (2 business days). The package came a good bit heavy, +1 for that. Most of the mdma is in large rocks, and the color is a very dark brown. Can&#039;t really say anything about the smell due to a stuffed up nose, but I will be testing this later in the evening. Will check back with results

				I&#039;m so happy but bummed out reading this! I saw their listening for the tan rock but I went off to look for reviews. I found lots of good reviews but of course they sold out before I could make a purchase. I can&#039;t wait for them to restock.
