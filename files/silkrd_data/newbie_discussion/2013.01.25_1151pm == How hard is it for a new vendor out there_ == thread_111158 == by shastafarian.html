				Hey guys, I started using this site for the opportunity for cheap molly that I could resell for way more. That&#039;s been going quite well so far, and I noticed something... all the weed on here is super expensive, I don&#039;t even see good o&#039;s for less than like 180. <br /><br />I&#039;ve made all this cash selling from SR to the real world, I&#039;m considering investing it in a vendor account so I could sell all my cheap Cali buds to SR. I&#039;d probably also order cheap foreign molly and sell it domestically. I&#039;ve researched shipping methods, have a cool cover business and good plans for stealth and I have plenty of experience being an ebay seller as well as just selling stuff to people. Makes me think I&#039;d be well qualified to do this. <br /><br />Just how hard is it though, to make it big on here? Does anyone with the proper dedication get popular fast, or is this a super cutthroat competitive environment for new sellers. I could give you guys like an ounce (split into 1g samples) for free to build feedback/a reputation for myself. <br /><br />Any advice for a potential new seller would be totally awesome :)<br />

				In my opinion (this is not my vendor name), it is quite hard, people EXPECT free samples for reviews, that&#039;s kinda bullshit I think. You have to set yourself apart somehow. You need great pricing and good communication and quick ships with great stealth, then the word will spread. Sell to enough people who have 50 (which makes it very very hard) posts, have them review you on the forums and keep it rolling. Not impossible but it takes work.

				I&#039;ll take some free samples. You don&#039;t even need to do that though. A lot of my best purchases have been through new seller deals. Just list your product at cost or slightly under cost, and I&#039;m sure enough people will take that risk and get you started on the path to a good reputation.

				Scammers will often target new vendors. Be prepared for a bunch of people hitting you up for free samples of threatening to give you bad feedback if you don&#039;t give them extra stuff.

You should put a store link. I&#039;m not promising anything, but I&#039;ll take a look and maybe make a purchase or two.

				Thanks for the feedback people, becoming a new vendor on here sounds way to difficult for where I&#039;m at right now.

				I&#039;m just a regular buyer and I have looked into how hard it is to become a vendor. It looks pretty dam hard like you need about 5 grand in cash handy and maybe over 1000 bucks worth of product to just get started. You will need reviews so other buyers will be more confident to order from you. I never hassle for free samples and if a vendor is giving them in exchange for reviews I want to at least pay for the shipping. Having said that I think 5 is enough reviews but a vendor that gives out more has better success quicker. I know that if I ever want to vend here then I got to be ready to give out samples for sure

				I would say the same as everyone else, you have to get a good rep around the forums and you must have to be prepared to give out a fair few free samples in order to get some good review back. That and competitive prices are key, you need something that stands out from everyone else selling.
