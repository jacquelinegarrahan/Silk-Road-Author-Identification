				Push the button!<br /><br />Just joking. The time has come to display more than two decimal places at the btc prices. I think 4 or 5 would be enough for the moment, how do you think about that?<br /><br />i also think you could display the actual exchange rates of â‚¬, $ and maybe some other currencys like the uk or the asiatic one :P . if that works with an automatical programm.<br />and the best would be the possibility to display the prices in that other currencys too.<br /><br />i let the crowd of newbies and maybe some others discuss about that, if there is not an other thread like this already maybe in an other category.<br /><br />great job by the way, even if this post will never be displayd to your piraty eyes.<br />ahoi!

				I agree about the decimal paces since the price is rising so quickly. Does anyone know offhand how often SR exchange rates update? I placed an order when BTC was $175. I was given the chance to cancel the order due to the buyers request for FE. I considered it since BC was now worth $220, but on SR it was only listed at $191 and considered it poor ethics to renege on a promise to pay where I thought FE was just, solely because it would benefit me financially.

				btc deflation is heavy in these day. i speculate on this going on and on. one btc will be worth thousands of units. now the whole thing comes from the web insiders to the public. and if it will be illegal in some areas that will only push the prices even more.<br />my actual btc transaction which is not completed yet was worth less than the half of the actual worth when i agreed :D<br />but an order of mine is still on the way which costs now just the third of the old btc price.<br /><br />i sometimes think in these day about breaking up the drug dealing stuff just chilling and looking my money growing :D

				as I understand it, it has been expanded.&nbsp; You&#039;ll only see the extra if your bitcoins are to that degree that they need it.<br /><br />so if you have 27.0025 you&#039;ll see that.&nbsp; if you have 27.4000 you&#039;ll only see 27.4<br /><br />or something like that
