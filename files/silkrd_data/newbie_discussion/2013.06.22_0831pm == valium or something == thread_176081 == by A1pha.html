				I was just looking on the road at valium and did not realise there was so many different varieties of downers. when we were kids we used to buy the blue 5mg vals and thought that was all there was but there is so much to choose from.<br /><br />what im looking for is a couple of pills I can pop along with two or three cans of lager that will put me in a happy place, not dribbling but smiley and buzxing, you know?<br /><br />what&#039;s the difference between valium or diazepam or lorezapam etc<br /><br />so what should I order? <br /><br />

				Well all benzo&#039;s have the same general feeling however some are a bit more recreational than others. To be honest though benzo&#039;s are the least recreational downers. I personally would recommend GHB or GBL for a more euphoric downer experience, or, while I dont know if they sell it on the road or not, I like phenibut better than benzos.<br /><br />In my experience the most euphoric (if you can call any of them euphoric) benzo would have to be alprazolam or temazapam.

				Xanax has more euphoria than Valium for me. You might also try Etizolam. It&#039;s got a bit of jolliness to it. I like all of them, but use them for taking the edge off after a stressful day or for easing the come down from other drugs.

				valium/diazepam (valium is a brand name for diazepam pills) is the longest-lasting of the benzos, and takes about 1.5hrs to fully kick in. it also builds up in your system, so if you&#039;re taking it daily, after a while you can lower your dose. this is not the case with other benzos.<br /><br />xanax/alprazolam (again, same thing) is much more short-acting. i believe generally it&#039;s the most abused benzo, the one people tend to like to drink with (though it&#039;s dangerous and blackout-inducing) and when i&#039;ve had prescriptions for it among other benzos, the one people most want to buy from me. it lasts 3-4 hours or so. if i take it when i dont need it for anxiety, though, xanax is the most likely benzo to make me just fall asleep.<br /><br />lorazepam/ativan and klonopin/clonazepam are mid-range in the half-life, last around 4-6 hours. klonopins always made me feel a little more buzzy than ativan.<br /><br />there&#039;s also etizolam, a short-acting benzo analogue, which is kind of weird to me... makes me feel a bit drunk on its own, and induces a little too much amnesia for me in higher doses, but in lower doses it has a bit of a mood lift and a silliness to it that i really enjoy on occasion.<br /><br />for the record valium is my favorite, but not to drink with -- i use it for general anxiety. i&#039;d say if you&#039;re dead-set on drinking with benzos (which i will perfunctorily say is a bad, bad idea) i would stick with a short-acting one like xanax so you can gauge the effects more quickly and not be zonked out in the morning. start with 0.25mg or less.

				Never been much for diazapam (valium) for recreation but to each there own. You want long lasting go for phenazapam, its legal too!!! At least in the states as far as I know, but be warned its very easy to overdo and if you do it last freaking forever,<br />

				thanks for the replies. I am not satisfied with my life, obviously we are all on here for a reason, there is a hole, however small in our lives that needs filling from time to time. <br /><br />I choose to fill mine with mary jane for the most part, with a side order of alcohol. <br /><br />

				The most recreational downer available here is SOMA (carisoprodol) Doctor Freedom has some good prices for that or there&#039;s also domestic US vendors. It blows any benzo out the water! There&#039;s no memory loss, a good body buzz and a pretty nice euphoria. It&#039;s not like benzos when you take too much and don&#039;t remember shit, with SOMA you can just take 5 pills and still remember what happened and feel extremely good. It&#039;s best mixed with opiates like hydrocodone though but alcohol mixes good with it as well.

				I&#039;ve never tried phenibut but I imagine it&#039;s similar to GHB seeing that they both act on the GABA-B receptor. I don&#039;t like GHB that much though.. SOMA is by far the best GABAergic I&#039;ve tried, I imagine only the old school barbiturates are better.

				Question was to the OP, but yeah your right, if you dont like G you wont like phenibut.<br /><br />If you like soma (carisoprodol) you would absolutely love meprobamate (sp?), as carisoprodol is a prodrug of meprobamate.<br />Soma is alright, Its definately better than benzos for recreational use. Only real use for benzos I find is for anxiety, to potentiate booze or opiates, or to calm down during a trainwreck psychedelic trip.

				no im not really experienced in this area, I am a smoker by trade and have only ever dabbled in this side of things.<br /><br />I was looking at the SOMA and there are strips of 10 350mg for sale domestically in the uk so might give that a go. <br /><br />how many would you recommend for me for a first time with a few beers and a joint. I am a big bloke, around 120kgs so can normally up my dose a bit.

				I usually take 4-5 but it&#039;s pretty strong and most people only need 2 or 3. Try with 3 at first, it should be enough if you plan on drinking! Well if you&#039;re 120kg you can probably take 5 for a first time and drink too but if you pass out it&#039;d be a waste :P If you haven&#039;t had enough you can always redose as SOMA hits you pretty fast.

They are also very personal. Some people sleep better on Alprozolam and some may not be able to sleep on alprozolam and so on. So you have to try yourself till you find the one that works fine for you. The different pills also have some that&#039;s better for sleeping some that&#039;s better for anxiety and what not, but it is still very personal. If you want to &quot;feel good&quot; I recommend you to try Alprozolam(Xanax). There is one vendor Named (CASLAVA) who sells it in powder form very cheap.

Plus you need a good scale to get the right dose. Some of these benzos are pretty potent. An extra 1mg can make big difference, especially if you&#039;re planning to mix it with alcohol, which it sounds like you are.

BAD ADVICE. if you must, and you plan to combine with alcohol, DO NOT START WITH MORE THAN ONE unless you fancy a blackout. you can always take more later, or next time. you can&#039;t un-take pills.
