				Had a package sent to me over a week ago containing 0.5g of product and it never showed up. Contacted vendor and he provided tracking number which showed that it had been delivered that Friday. Tracking info showed it then went back into transit for whatever reason and was delivered again on Monday. I thought this was very strange as when it is marked &quot;Delivered&quot; it should be waiting in my PO Box and not touched again. Both times it said it had been delivered to my local Post Office and today I went in there and asked about it and they said it was marked delivered so someone must have got it from my PO Box. All I know is that I haven&#039;t picked it up yet and nor has anyone on my behalf so where is it? Should I go back to the Post Office tomorrow and ask about it again? Get them to have a look around knowing that Australia Post can be unreliable and it could just be sitting in the back room somewhere OR could it have been seized and would I be getting myself in trouble by asking about it. I can&#039;t really turn around and deny I knew what was in the package or where it came from when I am asking them for it at the desk and have the tracking info for it. Have used this vendor before stealth is simple but effective and I have had up to 1g of product sent to this PO Box before without a problem. I could cut my losses and just leave it hoping one day it shows up but I won&#039;t be confident to order again until I know why this package never showed. Thanks in advance.

				I have had packages sent with tracking marked as delivered, only they have been delivered to the wrong address.<br />The shipping company fucked up and there&#039;s not a thing you can do about it, unless the person it was delivered to is honest and forwards it on to the correct address.<br /><br />If it was me I would cool my boots and see if it turns up. Maybe too risky trying to probe for it. I don&#039;t know anything about Australian law though, sorry.<br /><br />On the other hand if I was sick as a dog and needed 0.5g of H then I may be tempted to ask a few questions at the Post Office.<br /><br />Ball&#039;s in your court dude!

				Vendors frequently give you the tracking number for someone elses order. it&#039;s their way of trying to prove to you it arrived.<br />Or it could be a Auspost error.<br /><br />Have you finalised? Does the vendor have a good reputation?

				I&#039;m not too worried about getting my next hit I&#039;m more worried about making another order in case this one has been seized and any future mail I receive will also be seized. Definitely don&#039;t want to get myself in more trouble than I may already be in or waste more money. The vendor has a pretty good rep and I would be very surprised if someone in my area was ordering from the same vendor as me at around the same time. If they are they&#039;re definitely not sharing their gear judging by the absolute crap getting around locally. I think the tracking info is legit. I haven&#039;t finalized yet still got a week to go before auto finalize but should I finalize before then? Is there any other way the vendor could be at fault or scamming me? Considering the tracking info says delivered I can hardly expect any kind of refund or compensation. There&#039;s probably no reason for me not to finalize I think the vendor has done what he can from his end. I am still pretty new to SR and although I think I have a good understanding of it all I could easily be over looking something.

				In my experience with AustPost, if your packet has been seized and contents revealed Customs would contact Post Office and have box closed...happened to me few years ago

				In Oz, are they not required to send you a letter of seizure if they seize your mail?&nbsp; I honestly have no idea how your customs works, and I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s extremely effective compared to mine, but in the US they are required to notify you that your mail was seized by sending you a letter of seizure

Or does it just say delivered?<br />It is extremely unlikely that a domestic order got seized. Even with crappy packaging, orders should still be ok. There is no customs of checks for domestic mail. Only mail coming in from overseas gets checked. I have sent out hundreds of orders within Australia and all have arrived (except 3 but I think the buyers may have been trying to scam me, or they entered their address wrong).<br /><br />Don&#039;t finalise until you are happy with the outcome. Send a message to the vendor and explain what has happened and work from there. They may offer a reship or refund. if you accept their offer, then finalise after that. if you are not happy, Silk Road admins will decide on the refund. Unfortunately for a new buyer, it is unlikely you will receive much of a refund, if any at all.

				I also wondered about the letter of seizure. It&#039;s only a domestic shipment and I don&#039;t know what the procedure is if it were seized but I would expect they would contact me about it in some way.<br /><br />Tracking info is as follows starting from the bottom and reading upwards<br /><br />Date/Time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Activity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Facility location<br />29/04/13 04:26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivered &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;******(My Hometown)<br />29/04/13 04:25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting Collection at&nbsp; &nbsp; ******(My Local Post Office) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******(My Hometown)<br />29/04/13 04:24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Transit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;******(My Hometown)<br />26/04/13 05:01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivered &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;******(My Hometown)<br />26/04/13 04:48 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting Collection at&nbsp; &nbsp; ******(My Local Post Office) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******(My Hometown)<br /><br />Seems a bit sus to me that it would be delivered to the same place twice. Delivered should mean it has finished being handled and next person to touch it would be me when I collect it. If it is extremely unlikely that is has been seized like you guys say then I will confidently go back tomorrow show the post office the tracking details and get them to look around for it. I won&#039;t finalize until I have at at least done that.<br /><br />Thanks heaps for your opinions

				I&#039;m certain no one else has got it from my PO Box I don&#039;t think at any point the package has even been in my PO Box. I really hope I am not supposed to sign for it cause I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be doing that. Haven&#039;t had to before. The PO Boxes are in the Post Office so judging by the tracking info it has never left the building just for some reason it wasn&#039;t placed in my PO Box. I&#039;m thinking A) It has been seized (although this now seems quite unlikely) B) It has been misplaced in their sorting room and is probably gathering dust in the corner somewhere (hopefully) or C) It has been placed in the wrong PO Box which will could be quite a shock for someone who might have decided to open it or a nice treat for someone depending on what kind of person they are haha. So long as they don&#039;t report it cause it has my name on it :/
