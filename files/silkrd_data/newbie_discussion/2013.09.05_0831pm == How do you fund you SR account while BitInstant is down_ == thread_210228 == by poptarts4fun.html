				I have been reading forum after forum, here and on other sites as well, and I cannot seem to figure out how to acquire Bitcoins without using BitInstant. Currently, BitInstant says its working to improve their site and it will be down until they&#039;ve finished updating. Looks like it&#039;s been that way for over a month.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve done so far is create a Dwolla account. I have $500 in that account now (I waited the 4 business days for it to clear from my bank account into my Dwolla account). I have a Mt.Gox account which requires me to use BitInstant to add funds... is there a way to just add funds directly from Dwolla? I also just created a CampBX account but it requires that I wait 31 days after my initial USD transfer in order to buy Bitcoins. I don&#039;t have the luxury of waiting that long. I have done a small $5 deposit into the CampBX account just so I can let the clock run out, then I&#039;ll have that site as an option should I need it in the future. I also have a BitStamp.net account, as well. From what I can see, it does the same thing as Mt.Gox but I can&#039;t seem to figure out how to transfer from my Dwolla account into the BitStamp account.<br /><br />After I&#039;ve acquired the Bitcoins, I see how to launder the money through a few different wallets. My main issue is just bypassing that step that requires BitInstant. I see that SR is still buying and selling so I&#039;m sure that everyone else has a way to do it! As a newbie, I&#039;m still learning the process :-). Thank you in advance for your help.

				I went through the Coinbase procedure, which lets you buy bitcoins directly with bank transfers.&nbsp; The problem is that they charge high rates, and take 5 days to deliver the bitcoins.
