				Ok so I order a Florida ID over a month ago with rush production and priority shipping over a month ago and have yet to receive. Fauxydocs as been very fast to respond to messages and has a good seller history.&nbsp; But I was told 1 1/2 weeks ago it was shipped and nothing showed. Now I have been told it has shipped again but nothing today and their vendor account is now in stealth mode.Has anyone received a ID from Fauxydocs in the last couple days?&nbsp; :-[

				Have you already finalized your order with them?&nbsp; If not, take it to resolution and request a refund.

				The order auto finalized a little bit over a week ago. They swear I will get the id any day. So I am trying to see if any one else has received any orders from them over the last couple days.

				Got good news for all the others waiting finally got the ID today. It to forever but it does seem that Fauxydocs is staying loyal to the end and that demand respect. Other then the hologram layer not going to the edge it is flawless. They did change the birth year from what I requested to a year under 25. In my situation it&#039;s not a big deal but not everyone is just getting a ID to go to clubs many people like me use them for privacy. I can say that the quality did blow kingofclub&#039;s out of the water though. Thanks for staying loyal to the road to the end Fauxydocs . I left a review but it did not show up it must have something to do with stealth mode.
