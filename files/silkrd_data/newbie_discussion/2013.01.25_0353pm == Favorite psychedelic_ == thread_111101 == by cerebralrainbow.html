			<dd class="postbody">
				Hi there,<br /><br />This is my very first post. I&#039;ve browsed and read up on SR for a couple of months now, just made my first couple of purchases and thought I&#039;d finally contribute to the forums that have helped me thus far.<br /><br />I&#039;m a fairly (okay, very) heavy psychedelic user. They are something beyond special to me. I was an opioid and alcohol user for a long time, and was able to drop these two substances completely thanks to the insight gained from my trips. I&#039;m not knocking how anyone else gets their kicks -- I was an addict. I know, it isn&#039;t the substance, it&#039;s the user that&#039;s the problem (i.e. guns don&#039;t kill people, people kill people...) and that&#039;s what I love about psych&#039;s. I can&#039;t really become addicted. Besides that, My first experience (about 2 blotter hits of DOC, unknown mg) gave me such an intense self-reflective experience, I was able to sit back and sort my shit out. I had obtained this new confidence to give up the bad and welcome change.<br /><br />Since then (over a year ago now) I have had mind blowing experiences. I&#039;ve tried DOC, DOB, DOM, 2c-i, 2c-e, 2c-b, 25i, 25c, LSA, d-LSD, DMT, psylocin (and MDMA, but I don&#039;t really feel like that belongs) and I&#039;m sure a couple others I&#039;m unaware of. Each chem has been a unique experience. <br /><br />-------------------------------------------- END RANT--------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />SO my question to you all is... What is YOUR favorite. RC, ergotamine, tryptamine, combo -- whatever it is + a description of your favorite experience on said chemical.<br /><br />It&#039;s so hard for me to answer this myself. I went overboard with 9-10 liquid drops of DOB once and had the most intense full-on hallucinations I&#039;ve had from acid. Holy cow. I was desperately trying to get home before it kicked me in the face (YES, I KNOW, DRIVING = BIIIIIG NO-NO), but alas, too late. The clouds began forming hands and caressing the sun, which I couldn&#039;t even describe. I felt out of body. I looked in the passenger&#039;s seat and saw myself sitting there, smiling a devilish grin. Then, I swear I switched consciousnesses. I was watching myself drive. I tried to gain composure and stare at the vehicle ahead of me, but a great hydrogen cloud exploded from under it, sending it into the sky. That was the most memorable part. Wound up having a great night at the beach afterward. This was so different for me, because I&#039;ve seen the glorious colors, the shifting shapes, the feeling of floating out of your body, but until that point have never had an honest-to-god hallucination like that.... Physically though, DOx&#039;s are honestly my LEAST favorite. They are just poisonous, in my opinion.<br /><br />My favorite of all time would have to be DMT. Smoked out of a meth pipe, I was the only one out of a group of seven to break through. I can&#039;t even relate this mind fuck in any way that could be understood until you&#039;ve been there. Entirely alien and uncontrollable. This shit forces itself on you -- in a magnificently beautiful way. The hallucinations are intricate and astounding. I remember looking at my friends and just seeing aliens -- six eyes, strange heads and speaking in an alien tongue. The surrounding noises were turned into a symphony of sounds akin to those heard on some sort of space ship. I was in another world. That&#039;s really all that can be said without writing another couple of pages, and I know I&#039;m already a bit wordy :) I became a Buddhist the next few months following this due to some of the things I saw. Changed my life.<br /><br />Again, sorry for being wordy, but I thought I needed an intro at least. Happy tripping!<br /><br />-CR-

				I can&#039;t quite give an honest answer on this yet. I tried LSD once, with two hits, but they turned out to be fairly diluted and I just had a relaxing session of visuals. Nothing major came out. I also tried just 2.5G&#039;s of shrooms, which I later found out were some of the most potent out there, and I lost my shit. I feel like I haven&#039;t had an ideal experience of either yet. Just ordered some 2C-B, and might try Peyote soon too. I love psychedelics :)

				I have a lot of experience with mushrooms, some experience with LSD, and some experience with 2C-B.<br /><br />Mushrooms seems to be what I&#039;m looking for in a psychedelic. natural feeling, introspective, euphoric, and puts you in touch with nature better than anything else I&#039;ve tried.<br /><br />Yet to try some good mescaline though, it&#039;s on my short to-do list.

				Today I will be trying LSD again for the first time in about 15 years. For me back then LSD was a better trip than shrooms, but more potential to be scary. Shrooms were a great organic trip each time I&#039;ve had them. But the visuals never got to where LSD can take you. I want to try DMT too...<br /><br />Countdown 1 hr to drop.

				I don&#039;t think asking what someones &quot;favorite&quot; psychedelic is a fair question. All of them are designed to help the human being work through different parts of themselves. I&#039;m a big believer in people &quot;working up the ladder&quot; in the psychedelic realm. I cringe when I read posts about people saying I&#039;m doing LSD tonight for the first time, any advice? The psychedelic experience is one that needs to be taken seriously, and one that should be well planned out. They are not drugs to have fun with. They are meant for self examination, self exploration, and working through deep rooted issues. It&#039;s serious business. With that said, I would say the one psychedelic that doesn&#039;t get near the attention it should is ibogaine or iboga. It gets a lot of attention for it&#039;s opiate addiction curing properties, and yes it does work extremely well for this, but it is also a beautiful psychedelic for self growth. Ayahuasca is another great psychedelic that doesn&#039;t get much attention. As far as starting out down the psychedelic path, smoking salvia and psilocybin are great beginners. Jumping in too deep when you don&#039;t know how to swim is a great way to get yourself in trouble.

It was awesome. Shrooms are fucking good too. Also wish I could get hold of mescaline - I need a big house, with a big conservatory, so I can grow many many cacti.... one day.... [sigh]
