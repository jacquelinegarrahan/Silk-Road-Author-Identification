				So I tried to do my first moneygram cash to btc deposit at walmart which was a failure. I had all the info right, used a fake name, addy, phone number, etc but when she went to process the transaction, the terminal read &quot;Valid account number, invalid last name&quot;. Obviously I used a fake last name but because it was invalid she was unable to proceed with the transaction.<br /><br />Anybody else ever have this issue? I&#039;m about to try a second location with different info and see how it plays out.

				Just know that the names have to match the transaction # exactly. I had similar issue 1 time, the clerk had one letter off on last name and it wouldn&#039;t work. Got last name exact and real smooth!

				It can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours.<br /><br />Go to blockchain.info and enter the btc address you sent too.&nbsp; It will show you the transaction and sometimes you need like 10+ confirmations before it will show up in SR<br /><br />If you used a real email, then bitinstant should have sent you instructions detailing this.

				I think bitinstants maximum limit per transaction is $500 but you do multiple transactions<br /><br />Bitinstant can send it to many places and any btc address, yes even your SR address though you may not want to send it directly SR, that is up to you.<br /><br />I am really paranoid so I use many wallets and change addresses often, maybe its unnecessary but the blockchain shows every address&#039;s transaction history.&nbsp; The longer you keep an address the more of your spending habits are logged in the same place.&nbsp; So even though it is annonymous, keeping the same btc address for too long seems like an issue so that is probably why most wallets give you the option to &quot;get a new address&quot;, which I make sure to do every other transaction or so.<br /><br />
