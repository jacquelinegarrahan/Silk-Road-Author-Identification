				Just wondering if by some chance my first order would get seized. Is it automatically a felony to get drugs shipped to you in Canada even if its only 1 gram of weed or 1 tab of acid? I do want to make a purchase of a tab of acid but i just want to get as educated as possible. Would they really raid my house if they seized my package and they found a tab of acid? It seems kind of a waste of LE time. Maybe im just being to paranoid. I mean anyone can mail anyone anything it doesn&#039;t mean im guilty of a crime. Even if they do raid my house i would have no drugs in it anyways so unless they can prove i bought from SR i think i should be good. Again i think im just being a little to paranoid but its better i know the risks before doing anything. Also i know never to sign for packages if asked esp if i didn&#039;t order it with tracking. Any advice or information would be much appreciated.

				Acid doesn&#039;t smell and there is no way to tell its in there. They need a warrant to open mail and to get one, they need to know a lot of information .&nbsp; Assuming they are even looking at your package, which is really unlikely.&nbsp; It&#039;s sent to blend in with the mail. They are pros at doing this and ship thousands a week sort of thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />So why would yours be so special to get caught ?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; <br />Like you say , nobody will charge or convict you for that stupid amount.&nbsp; That&#039;s a big part of things here is that it&#039;s always ( or should) be a small amount that can&#039;t be detected or even if it was few would care or come knocking.&nbsp; They send a letter or a call.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is this yours?&nbsp; You say no. I&#039;m not expecting any packages officer. It must be a mistake or a joke.&nbsp; My address is all over the Internet on these chat sites and Facebook and shit .&nbsp; Sorry officer , no idea .<br /><br />That&#039;s it.
