Here is the problem I have with your posts:<br />1.)You refuse to put up pics of your bud. You expect me to trust that you are legit but refuse to operate within the realities of how trust works and call it fear. I lol&#039;d.<br />2.) You claim your bud is cheaper than anywhere on SR, but that is a bold faced lie. There are cheaper vendors on SR, look for yourself, asshat.<br />3.) You have zero history of sales. Wonder why? You have a terrible attitude and nobody would buy from a bully, try to be reasonable. Seal team 6 huh? Right...<br />4.) You have no reviews. Why are YOU afraid of offering samples to get some reviews? Do you want to sell on the SR or is your goal here to waste everyone&#039;s time, including your own? <br />5.) You say you will sweeten the weight if the buyer FE&#039;s, you do realize that you have to ship BEFORE the buyer can FE, right? Idiot.<br />The only fear I see and smell is from you. Ironic, isn&#039;t it.<br />Grow up, you are acting like a 12 year old, trying to bully old people. While I appreciate that you made me laugh out loud from your tactics, it&#039;s still just a waste of time...<br />Now, if you want to sell here, listen to the constructive criticism, or do you really think you are above that?<br />Good luck, really, you are going to need it.<br /><br />Until you start acting like a real vendor and not like a scammer, I will continue to refuse to be your customer. Not only that but I will recommend to anyone whom asks my advice to avoid you like the plague. You want people to trust you, on your word alone. Trust doesn&#039;t work that way, and I suspect you know this, hence you are a scammer.<br />People, beware of this supposed vendor. Buy at your own risk!

				The irony is you don&#039;t even get it that this is not like selling on the street where the buyer can look and sometimes even sample the product BEFORE committing to the purchase. The buyer wants to trust the seller but how? By being a jackass? By being abusive to your potential customer base? No, by establishing trust with the buyer.<br /><br />You don&#039;t get your money FIRST, idiot, you ship first and when said product arrives, THEN you get paid, THAT&#039;S why the onus is on YOU to establish trust with your CUSTOMER, not the other way around as you&#039;d like to imagine. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t offer that then I suggest you close up shop here and go back to the street where johnny tough guy behavior works, because your current attitude is having the EXACT opposite effect. <br /><br />When you alienate your customers and act abusive or hostile to them you destroy ANY potential success you might otherwise enjoy here.<br />Most of the items I pointed out are ways YOU can establish trust with your POTENTIAL customers.<br /><br />Around here. at the SR, we do business where it is a buyers market, not a sellers market. YOU live or die by that rule, so I suggest you don&#039;t forget it.<br />What do I know, though, right?<br />&nbsp;;)

				I see you&#039;re still listing that &quot;Med grade&quot; strain. LOL. This reminds me of that dealer that&#039;s always got &quot;the FIYA!&quot; Your profile page shows a remarkable level of apathy, even for a stoner. I can say from the short time I&#039;ve been here that without pictures and strains, you will probably not see much interest. You certainly won&#039;t get a second look from me. Beef up your profile page a bit, figure out what strain your shit is, and post some pictures. I&#039;m not trying to be rude, but marketing, dude ... come on. Would you go on ebay and put up a listing that said &quot;Very nice sofa&quot; with no pics or info? No. Would you buy the sofa? I certainly hope not.
