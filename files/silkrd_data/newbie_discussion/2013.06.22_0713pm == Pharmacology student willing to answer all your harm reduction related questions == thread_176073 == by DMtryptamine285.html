				Hello all, I am a pharmacology major, general enthusiast and avid autodidact. I have been offering my expertise on many harm reduction forums such as drugs forum, herbs.maxforums, and bluelight (on some of which I am a moderator).<br /><br />If you have any questions regarding any substance feel free to ask in this thread or PM me. I am going into the psychedelic sciences, fully understand complex receptor relationships, ROA&#039;s, pharmacodynamics, metabolism, and many other aspects which could be of use to many on this forum. I love to help so feel free to ask away... Not to mention I&#039;m trying to get my post count up so I can post in the harm reduction forums. I have detailed write-ups on all kinds of psychoactives I would like to upload as I think it could benefit this community.

				I&#039;ve got a question DMtryptamine285,<br /><br />Its about oral bioavailability.<br /><br />I was looking at an opiod comparison chart and from what I understand reading the chart, the oral bioavailability of opana (oxymorphone) is only 10%. Does that mean I will not feel 10mg of oxymorphone as strongly as I would feel 10mg of oxycodone if I were to take both in pill form?<br /><br />I know the feel is largely subjective but going strictly off of those charts, am I correct in thinking I will need to take more oxymorphone in order to get a comparable feel to a smaller amount of oxycodone?<br /><br />The chart said to be careful because opiods don&#039;t strictly translate the way we would think based upon chart numbers and that one needs to take into account the buildup of the drug in the body over time and other factors.<br /><br />Thanks for providing this service! +1 karma to you!

				You are correct in your assumption that Oxymorphone has a very low oral bio-availability (while I havent checked opiate/opioid equivalency in a while I believe it is around 10% bio-availability through oral administration. The Bioavailability of oxycodone through oral administration is between 60-87% I believe.<br /><br />That being said, bio-availability is not the only relevant value, oxymorphone is much more potent than oxycodone so much so that it actually ends up being more potent even when taken orally than oxycodone. About two times more potent when taken orally seems to be the general consensus. Ten mg of oxymorphone will likely be more potent even orally than 10mg oxycodone despite the bio-availability difference. It all comes down to individual metabolism and of course the effects are entirely subjective.<br /><br />In theory though, the oxymorphone should still be more potent. The ratio used in the medical community for converting between oxycodone to oxymorphone is 2:1 for the oral ROA, so the oxymorphone will still be more potent<br /><br />hope that was helpful<br />

				5mg of oxymorphone would feel like 10mg oxycodone assuming both are instant release and taken orally. Sorry for taking so long, I had to go look up opioid equivalencies again as opioids are not really my area of expertise.

				If you have opana IR, I highly recommend at least snorting it, it&#039;s 5 times as strong as oral administration. The only way with oxymorphone is IV though, 1mg of it is equivalent to 10mg of IV morphine. It&#039;s dangerous though because accurately measuring 1/10th of a pill isn&#039;t so easy.<br />Unless you&#039;re prescribed opana, it&#039;s a huge waste of money to eat it!

				Wow DMtryptamine285, you&#039;re a dream come true<br />There are a few people discussing microdosing LSD and lots of questions there - are sub-threshold effects likely to be vastly different, for example long term use of 15ug doses once per day for 3 days every week or two, is there anything knows on anti-depressant or stimulatory effects, or even neural regeneration or something like that? <br />[I will formulate better questions once my excitement wears off that I can ask you things I&#039;m dying to know]<br /><br /><br />One question I had some time ago was with LSD as a diuretic. Some people report laxative effects, some people say they don&#039;t need to pee ever, but I have definitely experienced large measurable diuretic effects - is there an effect on Chlorine channels maybe, or could it be a side effect of hypothalamic agonism --&gt; ADH inhibition? again with different people reporting different things I just don&#039;t understand<br />

				Thanks for being open to questions!!!&nbsp; I&#039;d like your opinion on my &quot;condition.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;LOL&nbsp; &nbsp;I was an avid user of &#039;bath salts&#039; before they were pretty much taken off the market here in the US.&nbsp; The consensus is the main ingredient in these was most likely MDPV...but as the regional bans started going into effect, I believe a-PVP and perhaps 4-FMC were being used in the lstter-day preparations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I was on a great 20 month usage pattern with these various branded products...they made me feel confident, social, funny, euphoric...I never seemed to build a tolerance in those 20 months, and never really felt a need to increase my dosage that much.&nbsp; &nbsp;And then, all of a sudden, the party suddenly stopped...either my branded products no longer contained the proper chems or my brain chemistry closed up shop.&nbsp; &nbsp;This occurred about 4 months ago.&nbsp; Since then it has been increasingly hard to get back to that desired state of being - confident, productive, rosy, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, the bath salts have pretty much dried up, as well as whatever the magic, missing ingredient was.&nbsp; &nbsp;During this time I have switched over entirely to research chemicals.&nbsp; &nbsp;The closest proximity I have attained to &quot;the old feeling&quot; is with a-PVP...however it is not the greatest substitute.&nbsp; I have become a lot more withdrawn and a lot less social.&nbsp; This is despite having amphetamines around like 2-FA, 3-FA, 4-FA, 2-FMA which I have failed too achieve any significant effects from...I have had mephedrone for the first time (outside of any bath salt product that -may- have contained it) .&nbsp; I was so excited to finally be able to try some real mephedrone, but what I experienced was almost the opposite of a what I was expecting: an opiate like numbing and a generally &quot;stoned&quot; cannabinoid feeling.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />So that is a little background....my question is, what is going on here?&nbsp; &nbsp;Did I wear out my dopamine releasing ability from too much bath salt usage?&nbsp; Did I finally &#039;hit the wall&#039; and tolerance decided to rapidly take over ??&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it because the &quot;magic ingredients&quot; in whatever were in bath salts are not being adequately substituted for with the a-PVP or RC amphets ???&nbsp; &nbsp;Has my brain chemistry undergone a strange reversal from too much stimulant abuse???&nbsp; &nbsp;One friend posited the theory that my stimulant use caused my brain to act like I had ADHD...in essence made me immune to the normal stimulating effects of amphetamines as seen in ADHD patients, hence my peculiar reaction to the mephedrone (almost a reversal of all supposed effects.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously one answer is to QUIT ABUSING STIMULANTS and give my neurotransmitters a break.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe after some time off, my dopamine producing ability may return.&nbsp; &nbsp;At any rate, I want the old euphoric confidence back in my life...the ability to be happily productive and socially affable...I&#039;ve been in a depressive tail-spin for a few months and none of the magic elixirs available to me are cutting it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What do you think is going on here, friend?&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides total abstinence, which is probably not realistic right now, how do you think I can best recalibrate my brain chemistry to work with me again?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I appreciate any thoughts you or the community have...I&#039;m sure there are others who have experienced this puzzling state of affairs.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you, Thank you. <br /><br />(P.S. I was on a daily high dosage of Paxil for three years, up till about a year ago when I weaned myself off.&nbsp; Not sure if this has a played a role in anything.)

				Haha thanks, I love this community and would like to give back anyway I can, while I have no money I do have knowledge.<br /><br />Now to answer your question, unfortunately not a lot is known in medical literature because of the difficulty of studying schedule 1 drugs in humans, most of the data we do have comes from the early sixties and up until very recently psychedelic research was rather taboo. That being said there are some recent fascinating studies regarding neural regeneration, although the studies where done with psilocybin as apposed to LSD, both compounds act as 5ht2a agonists so it should hold true for LSD as well.<br /><br />Anecdotal evidence suggests there are multiple benefits to microdosing LSD and other psychedelics and people in high power positions have been known to do it with some regularity. I could definitely see the potential for anti-depressant effects and anecdotal reports seem to confirm this.<br /><br />As to diuretic effects it really depends on the substance in question, I will have to look into this further to get some more accurate and informed answers for you because honestly its not something I ever really thought about. I personally notice urinary retention from most psychedelics especially LSA and to a lesser extent LSD, I think this is due to mild vascular constriction.<br /><br />

I also experienced extreme dry mouth from LSD and obviously cannabis. Do you know the mechanism of this? I was intrigued to discover the the same ion transporter in salivary acinar cells as in loop of henle in kidney (Na/K/Cl carrier), and was wondering if there could be a link with diuresis in the stimulation, maybe in the parasympathetic nervous system. I understand cannabis would be triggering cannibinoid pathways, but would they also stimulate 5-HT2s? or at least their end product might be similar? Sorry these are very wide open questions, as I read more and get to studying neurophysiology I&#039;ll have more precise ones that I&#039;m trying to figure out.

				The mechanism by which cannabis seems to be producing the drymouth is due to CB1 and CB2 receptors being present in submandibular gland (SMG) which is responsible for producing approx 70% of saliva in the mouth. <br /><br />Hope that answers your question. Damn If I could plus rep you for even asking that I would, Good question actually. Had to do a bit of research.

				So the LSD mechanism might be different (and again probably different in different people), you&#039;ve inspired me to learn the physiology<br />Going to do a bit of reading this summer on it all, and start learning the neuro in autumn, hope you stick around on the drug safety as this is all very new and exciting for me, thanks again for the replies.

				Thanks for this thread DMtryptamine! I love this sort of thing. I&#039;ve often debated become a pharmacology major (as long as I could avoid the GPA requirements of med school, as I&#039;ve already fucked that opportunity up...). What sort of work can you do with that degree, if you don&#039;t mind me asking? It is my dream major, and I&#039;m wondering if it could lead to my dream job.<br /><br />I have a few questions that I hope aren&#039;t too off-topic. I know I&#039;m posting quite a few, so pick and choose if I&#039;m taking advantage, lol. Do you know anything about the effects of SAMe on MDMA? I take SAMe as well as an SSRI regularly, but have recently gone off both since I&#039;m getting an MDMA order in soon. The SSRI I know would block much of the serotonin activity of the SSRI, but is going off SAMe necessary as well? Also, about how long before the SSRI will no longer diminish the effects of the MDMA? I am coming off of citalapram, which has about a 36 hour half-life. Seeing as it&#039;s not prozac, I&#039;m hoping a couple weeks off will have me covered.<br /><br />Also, would 25C-NBOMe have a similar sublingual dosage range as 25I-NBOMe?<br /><br />Lastly (I&#039;ll save my kratom/opioid questions for now, lol), do you know of any easy way to make sure some 2C-E I&#039;m about to get is what it&#039;s suppose to be, and not, say... Bromo-dragonfly? It&#039;s a long shot, but figured I&#039;d ask... lol.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=176073.msg1264365#msg1264365">Quote from: cricketplank on June 22, 2013, 08:34 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wow DMtryptamine285, you&#039;re a dream come true<br />There are a few people discussing microdosing LSD and lots of questions there - are sub-threshold effects likely to be vastly different, for example long term use of 15ug doses once per day for 3 days every week or two, is there anything knows on anti-depressant or stimulatory effects, or even neural regeneration or something like that? <br />[I will formulate better questions once my excitement wears off that I can ask you things I&#039;m dying to know]<br /><br /><br />One question I had some time ago was with LSD as a diuretic.

				To glenrunner. There are three possible problems which could be causing you to not get the desired effects from your stimulant of choice. The first is that nobody knows what was in those branded products and it could have been a combination of substances instead of just one. The problem with those kind of products is that the ingredients are constantly changing.<br /><br />The second is tolerance, this usually occurs because of receptor downregulation. The obvious solution here would be to give your receptors a break. If that is absolutely not an option, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate antagonists can often be used for a quick receptor reset (substances in this catagory include ketamine, MXE, DXM, ect.) I am not advising that you do this but it does theoretically work for both stimulants and opiates. Be warned though, abusing NMDA antagonists can cause its own set of problems.<br /><br />The third possibility, which also sounds likely, is that the vendor of your mephedrone (if that was indeed what your branded products contained) accidently gave you the wrong product. Mephedrone should NOT have opiate and synthetic cannabinoid like effects. It should be an MDMA like stimulant. Now before you go accuse the vendor of giving you the wrong product I would try mephedrone from a different source and see if the effects are the same as it may just be how your body reacts to this particular compound, its just what you described is not the stereotypical effects.<br /><br />The best solution would be to take a break from all dopaminergic (stimulant) substances for a while and let your receptors naturally reset themselves.<br /><br /><br />

				To Rafeal 5. Yes, LSD is active via intraoccular administration (dropping it in the eye), however if you choose this ROA you need to make damn sure what you have is actually LSD otherwise it could cause serious damage. I would advise reagent testing before choosing to administer via this method.<br /><br />There are trip reports on the net about people doing this and receiving effects however I would be wary about this ROA, however it should theoretically work.

				Well Dr Fernando. I am actually planning on going to med school<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to be a bio major to get into medical school, as long as you have a high GPA and take some required courses. You can go to med school with a pharmacology major, psych major, bio major, pretty much any related field. Pharmacology degree will allow you to go into medical research or work for a pharmaceutical company or lab. Its more of an entrepreneurial field than an easy field to get employment in. You have to discover something.<br />

				Something I&#039;d like to get your thoughts on:<br />A couple of years ago I spent a couple of months with a gram a day ketamine habit, at some point during this period I was lying down in a pretty disassociated k-hole type of situation when someone unexpectedly entered the room who wasn&#039;t supposed to be there and wasn&#039;t supposed to know I was on ketamine. I was aware they had come into the room and addressed me and I summoned an awful lot of will to drag myself up and pretend like I was sober, but this exertion dragged me pretty forcibly out of the peak of a disassociated state (snapping out of being unaware of my body to trying to summon full control). Anyway, since this snap back into reality I have had the left side of my face a kind of numbness running between my temple and down to my mouth. But this isn&#039;t a typical numb sensation like pins and needles or whatever. I feel it moving up and down my face pretty much constantly, as well as rotating about. It is very difficult to describe and I am fairly sure it is some kind of neurological damage. One thing I notice is that if&nbsp; I smoke cannabis the sensation is more pronounced and can move all the way around my head, changing sides and so on.&nbsp; Any idea what it could be or what could be done to mitigate it?

				CITVVTIC I am very sorry about your condition however I would like to get some more information from you. I would like to discuss this with you in PM so feel free to PM me the answers to the following questions so I can better assist you.<br /><br />1. How long has it been since the specific incident occured which caused the lasting damage, and has it gotten any better over time?<br />2. Do any medications or drugs make it better, benzodiazapines, opiates, lyrica/gabapentin?<br />3. Where you using any other substances at the time when the incident occured?<br />4. Do you have any other medical conditions<br />5. Have you seen a doctor about this, and if so what did he/she say?<br /><br />I would suggest that you see a physician about this if you haven&#039;t done so already and to be completely honest about what triggered your symptoms. While I am not a medical doctor, It seems as though you may have suffered some degree of oxygen deprivation which could explain some of your lasting symptoms. Dissociatives can in some cases cause respiratory depression. This is not a substitute for medical advice and I am not an MD so I can only give you my opinion, a thorough diagnosis cannot be conducted over the internet.

				Would you be so kind to address your thoughts regarding the use of Ketamine as a tool to combat heavy MDPV use for approximately 14 months? It&#039;s SWIM (honest), so I really cannot speak to any thought processes, cravings, or internal justifications.&nbsp; However, references to Katamine being a somewhat useful anti-depressent were raised in conversation with this person and it was mentioned briefly a few posts back and what you said peaked my interest.&nbsp; Additionally, there is an autoimmune health issue that the Ket may help with as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you for your kindness, it&#039;s so very appreciated.

				To middle, I don&#039;t have Tormail but feel free to shoot me a PM.<br />I still haven&#039;t figured out the PGP thing. I&#039;m going to start looking into it because it seems alot of people are using it.<br /><br />To: my red shoes, Ketamine does have documented anti-addictive properties. That being said I think high dose daily use could cause more harm then good. The best use for NMDA antagonists in preventing addiction is really the reduction of tolerance, when one is using NMDA antagonists, in my experience tolerance to a wide range of other substances builds slower.<br /><br />Tell SWIY that there have been documented cases of psychological addiction to ketamine.

				Hey there dude, great idea for a thread. As a ChemE student with a firm belief that all substances can be used responsibly (though not necessarily as recreation), I appreciate what you&#039;re trying to do here.<br /><br />I have a small set of questions related to this summer, my summer of fun before engineering really picks up. I&#039;m going around to a handful of camping-style festivals, and looking for a bit of feedback on my general plan.<br /><br />day 0: arrive, set-up, get drunk and smoke, possibly a little coke.<br />day 1: recover, possibly low dose of LSD (circa 30-50 mcg), as night falls MDA/MDMA mix (2:3 ratio, 125 mg dose followed by 50 mg booster)<br />day 2: 1-2 doses LSD (150-200 mcg), MDA and/or MDMA (similar dosage pattern) in the evening<br />day 3: piracetam (what time would be best for a starter dose), followed by a larger &quot;crash&quot; dose in the afternoon, with some MDMA. Booster dose of MDMA in the evening.<br /><br />Drinking will be kept to a minimum after arrival day. DMT is a possibility at some point. I hate opiates, and never want to do ketamine again after my first k-hole, so this would be the limit of my usage, except a possible 0.5mg xanax as landing gear from the acid.<br /><br />Does this seem &quot;reasonable&quot; (I already had a near miss with losing my sanity and becoming a dreaded festival gypsy on 300+ mcg LSD), and what dosage patterns would you suggest for piracetam? I don&#039;t know much about it, but it supposedly reduces tolerances/enhances substituted amphetamines, and I know I don&#039;t like eating too much MDx. Finally, do you have any additional ideas on hangover recovery? I usually drink a coconut water and eat a banana before I pass out in a stupor, and then hit the gatorade and grease in the morning.<br /><br />Thanks again

				This doesn&#039;t seem seem too crazy, actually pretty conservative compared to allot of festival goers. I personally wouldn&#039;t dose the MDMA/MDA back to back like that, its always best to keep MDMA/MDA doses spread apart to avoid potential neurotoxicity (debated), but as long as your not a regular user then It really shouldn&#039;t be a problem. I wouldn&#039;t use MDMA/MDA in the weeks leading up to the festival at all.<br /><br />I honestly dont really know much about the racetams at all. I personally have never taken them, but people take some pretty massive doses without to many side effects so I would say its probably safe. I know alot, but unfortunately not everything lol.

				If you mean phenethylamines like 2C-B then you won&#039;t have a very strong effect if you&#039;re on SSRIs. Amphetamine is okay though, there&#039;s a risk of serotonin syndrome but it&#039;s pretty low.<br /><br />To measure milligrams without a good scale you&#039;d need to make a solution. Your best bet would be to accurately weigh 100mg (maximum +/- 10mg of inprecision) and dissolve in a precisely measured amount of liquid. 1mL are very precise and nothing too expensive to I&#039;d recommend that if your substance is soluble enough. Then you just take 0.1mL for 10mg or 0.05mL for 5mg, I&#039;d drop it on a piece of cotton and parachute it because drinking drugs in solution is pretty unpleasant.

				i apologize first of all for my lack of terminology, what follows is layman&#039;s terms :)<br /><br />When &#039;neurotoxic&#039; pops up in reference to certain drugs/mixture of drugs/or redosing drugs, I&#039;ve always wondered to what extent that means<br />Is it irreparable damage or temporary? And to what extent are the symptoms? memory loss/confusion/anxiety??? And is the damage scalable to the amount drug / different drugs taken in one session?<br /><br />I just wonder because I have been sensible for a few years now but back in the day some nights got very messy with mixtures of drugs (ket, stimulants and 2c&#039;s to name a few)&nbsp; and other nights went on for literally days without sleep, i dont want to go into too much detail lest i sound irresponsible :)<br /><br />But i&#039;m basically wondering if the sort of damage that may have occurred is totally irreperable or at least partially? or can the &#039;receptors&#039; regain full functionality?<br /><br />And another quick question. Not sure if you have heard of the &#039;flashes&#039; or &#039;jolts&#039; but after some particularly long/messy sessions i can remember whilst sitting down the feeling as if a jolt of electricity went through me.. not uncomfortable or painful or even that severe, but definitely noticeable, and in the minds eye it felt like a white flash this would happen periodically for quite some time if not until a long sleep.<br /><br />feel free to pm<br />big props for helping out in this manner your enthusiasm is inspiring

				Wow lol, quite a bit of questions at once... Ill try to answer them all but I apologize if I may have missed a few.<br /><br />Question: &quot;How can I avoid harming my bladder while have long-term use of Ketanime?&quot;<br /><br />Answer: Decrease your frequency of use... Its really the only suggestion I have, unfortunately when you abuse drugs daily at high doses side effects do happen, there really isn&#039;t in my experience a good way to prevent this other than take a break as far as I know.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Question: &quot;Do you know how much &quot;harmine&quot; is needed to combine with: <br />- DMT<br />- LSD<br />- mushrooms&quot;<br /><br />Answer: Hmmm, this can vary significantly person to person but generally anywhere from 100-200mg is a good dose for mono-amine oxidase inhibition. It would be taken orally, and it really doesn&#039;t matter what psychedelic your using along with it, as long as MAO is fully inhibited it should potentiate whatever amines you choose.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Question: why is Darvon Compound 65 or any strength of that banned in cali? nobody here know what that is. i LOVED them better than norcos or codeine maybe even oxycodone. your thoughts sir/ma&#039;am<br /><br />Answer: Darvon (propoxyphene (sp?)) was banned following a series of lawsuits due to cardiac side effects including fatal arrythmias occuring in a minority of users. I was actually one of those few people who liked darvon too so I understand how you could like it better than norco. It had its own unique buzz.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Question: Would it be stupid or even dangerous to combinate a los dose DXM (Dex) and Shrooms?<br /><br />Answer: Well DXM in addition to being an NMDA antagonist is also a mild SSRI so there may be some potential for serotonin syndrome although I think that it would be minuscule if any at all. There are numerous reports on this combination and there don&#039;t seem to be any life threatening reactions reported from what I can find... Then again, I may very well be wrong. Best to start with low doses of both substances.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Question: When &#039;neurotoxic&#039; pops up in reference to certain drugs/mixture of drugs/or redosing drugs, I&#039;ve always wondered to what extent that means<br />Is it irreparable damage or temporary? And to what extent are the symptoms? memory loss/confusion/anxiety??? And is the damage scalable to the amount drug / different drugs taken in one session?<br /><br />Answer: depends on the substances in question, I cant really answer this without more detail. Generally though, in all but the most severe cases taking a break and giving your receptors time to reset themselves will alleviate most of these symptoms. Contrary to popular believe the brain does regenerate, its an incredibly resilient organ.<br /><br />Question: And another quick question. Not sure if you have heard of the &#039;flashes&#039; or &#039;jolts&#039; but after some particularly long/messy sessions i can remember whilst sitting down the feeling as if a jolt of electricity went through me.. not uncomfortable or painful or even that severe, but definitely noticeable, and in the minds eye it felt like a white flash this would happen periodically for quite some time if not until a long sleep.<br /><br />Answer: I know exactly of what you speak. It is usually due to imbalances in serotonin after abusing your serotonin system, it will go away with time. It can also occur when discontinuing SSRIs. I call it the zaps.<br />

				Hi, thanks for offering your time to answer so many questions. Log one in the good karma account for you :)<br /><br />My question: Is it safe to do coke while on low dose lexapro? (10 mg/day). I have actually done both together before (years ago, was a lot younger) , but this time around the coke I ordered is from SR and from a top quality vendor, hence higher potency. I have heard the dangers of possible serotonin syndrome, but most seem to think coke has only very mild effects on serotonin, most of its effect being on nor-epi/dopamine. I plan on doing super tiny bumps and needle thin half lines to assess my tolerance at first.<br /><br />Your thoughts?

There is already a thread in existence for this very thing called thedrugXchange.<br /><br /><br />Bodizzle, I did a little research to try and find any specific interactions on cocaine and lexapro and I couldn&#039;t come up with anything. I believe Lexapro is an SSRI and to the best of my knowledge SSRIs do not interact with dopamine reuptake inhibitors like cocaine (but I could be wrong). Many prescription medications combine these mechanisms of action (ssdri).<br /><br />

It has to be completely dry to work though.. I&#039;d remove the coating, crush the pill to a fine powder, put it in the dry solvent, stir/shake periodically (put it in something sealed) for 24 hours, then filter, and let the acetone evaporate. The residue left when the acetone evaporates should be the oxymorphone.<br /><br />I know dry acetone works with OPs and I&#039;ve seen guides to extract oxymorphone with isopropyl alcohol so I think both should work. Ethanol should work too if isopropyl alcohol works.

				@DMtryptamine285 -- Thanks for starting this thread. It&#039;s been a great read so far. I have a question for you, regarding chemical imbalances in the brain. <br /><br />Guess this will require some backstory/exposition: As a teenager (years ago in high school), I did several &quot;Robo-Trips,&quot; DXM. Very high doses, reaching the higher plateaus. Pretty sure I reached the 4th plateau during 1 trip. Also I was (still am), a heavy Marijuana user. And I would pretty much take anything else that a person handed me as far as pills, etc. Basically just trying to get fucked up in some way. Anyway, onto my question: I was diagnosed along the way with Bi-Polar disorder after a hospitalization (due to a panic attack triggered in part by drug use, and lack of sleep, among a few other key contributing factors). I tried to listen at the time &amp; learn as much as I could about the science from all the tests they did &amp; whatnot..but some of it was out of my grasp, still to this day. Some more backstory: They put me on an anti-psychotic, called Depakote. I took for the medication for a while, along with behavioral psycho-therapy. After several months of meeting with the therapist, she deemed me to be ok, and said we didn&#039;t need to meet anymore. She did continue me on the script, which I kept up for a little while longer. But eventually I decided I didn&#039;t feel the need to take daily meds. I didn&#039;t really like the &quot;zombie-like&quot; effects of it. And the, unexpected, side-effect of killing my sex drive was unacceptable. Also just taking meds daily made me feel as if I was disabled, or something was wrong with me..when I like to think of myself as a pretty healthy person overall. So I eventually went off the meds. Didn&#039;t really experience any negative symptoms from stopping, so I just went on about my life. I have, for the most part, not experienced any manic episodes since the one mentioned above. There have been a few times that I&#039;ve felt similar things as when I had the panic attack &amp; hospitalization, but I can usually keep it under much better control. Very rare that I experience those feelings anyway.There have been some moments of slight depression, but I&#039;ve gone thru 2 deaths in the family, so those were pretty &#039;normal&#039; experiences, I would say. The hospitalization I encountered was def. a manic episode, but in general, I have much better control over things than I did back in high school. I&#039;ve learned a lot about myself, and grown thru the experience. So I guess my question overall is about permanent brain damage from DXM? The doctors seemed to hone in on that particular drug, among all the stuff I had done, they seemed to think that 1 caused most damage. They did an MRI, and I guess saw some sort of &quot;Chemical Imbalance,&quot; in the results. I&#039;ve been curious about this in the years since the hospitalization, mostly because I def. felt a strong sense of &quot;just diagnose him, write a script, and get him outta here.&quot; I&#039;ve read about other Psych wards in the U.S. and there seems to be a pre-occupation with labeling the patient. No one ever leaves the ward deemed to be &quot;healthy,&quot; everyone comes out with some sort of diagnosis. So I guess I&#039;m curious about the long-term effects of DXM (which I&#039;ve only really done maybe 2x since high school) on the brain. And what exactly is a &quot;Chemical Imbalance?&quot; Any info would be appreciated..I look forward to reading your response :).

				^^ Hearts, nobody can know, not even Dr Nichols. We can extrapolate from what we know about its pharmacology and binding affinity and such. Its a 5ht2a agonist, but that doesn&#039;t tell us much, what are its metabolites, does it cause cell death, is it carcinogenic, does it alter DNA, ect, ect. We know less about the NBOME RCs than perhaps any other RC. I would speculate, and this is just an educated guess, that in reasonable doses they are not that dangerous and all the deaths are from blatant overdose due to eyeballing dosages. I would also speculate that its main danger and the reason it can cause death in overdose is due to peripheral vasoconstriction.

				GTAthreeguy, how can a doctor see &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; on an MRI, what they probably thought they saw on the MRI was some form of olnies lesions also known as NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity and it is still unproven in humans. Even if it is real (which it probably is at massive and prolonged doses), NAN is not necessarily permanent, the brain does heal itself and braincells do regrow and regenerate. Its highly unlikely that you caused yourself any permanent damage, perhaps the use of DXM may have brought out some underlying disorder that you always had to the surface, but you would likely have had at some point developed it anyways. Chemical Imbalance is another way to say they really don&#039;t know but don&#039;t want to tell you they don&#039;t know, as that could mean many things... Which chemical was imbalanced and what kind of MRI did they perform, was it an fMRI? Something about that just doesn&#039;t make sense.

				^^ Yes I could advise cutting back your use significantly. MDMA is neurotoxic, it just is although many would like to believe otherwise. The degree to which it is neurotoxic is debated but most would agree to some extent it is neurotoxic. It depletes serotonin, that&#039;s not debated. You could try preloading and postloading to increase the production of serotonin, 5htp may help, but also be careful as it has been implicated in serotonin syndrome in combination with MDMA. I do think taking it after rolling would help replenish serotonin supplies faster.<br /><br />

				this board is so interesting. damn I love science.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading up on/wondering about ketamine&#039;s affect on dopamine receptors...well I&#039;m still sort of confused about the whole topic so I&#039;d really appreciate any sort of insight on this.<br /><br />I know that, when taking a break from amphetamines, people use ketamine to aid the recovery process, lower tolerance and get the euphoric effect again. But how does K help? Does it &#039;reset&#039; the brain&#039;s dopamine receptors? Or does it help the brain regulate its dopamine production? Is it lowering tolerance in some way? Is it only a temporary fix (like eating baking soda to make your body more alkaline which increases amph absorption) or is it really repairing something?<br /><br />And how would this translate in terms of self-treatment? Just do K once? Low doses spread over a few weeks? Try getting in a K-hole? Can it help prevent tolerance as well?

				Here is the best theory on this I have seen.<br /><br />&quot;Amphetamine tolerance is caused by excess Ca++ influx through the NMDA receptor gated calcium channels on the outer membranes of the dopamine cells bodies in the ventral tegental area, one of two areas in the brain with concentrations of dopamine producing neurons.<br />As alluded to above, taking an appropriate NMDA (partial) antagonist will prevent the development of a tolerance for the effects of an amphetamine or amphetamine-like stimulant. Also, by preventing excess Ca++ influx into the neuron, an NMDA antagonist will prevent associated brain alterations and damage (excitotoxicity).<br /><br />Studies have indicated that amphetamine tolerance is prevented by exogenous or endogenous agents that are able to inhibit excess Ca++ influx into the neuron through the gated calcium channels on the neuronal membrane that have NMDA subtype glutamate receptors.Glutamate , the body’s major excitatory neurotransmitter, opens the gated calcium ion channels upon attaching to the NMDA receptor. A number of other receptors are also expressed on these calcium channels, which, when stimulated, either facilitate or inhibit glutamate’s action.<br /><br />It is also important that agents that inhibit calcium channel activity not also cause deficient Ca++ influx. For example, ketamine is a full NMDA receptor antagonist, that prevents excess Ca++ influx and amphetamine tolerance. But being a full NMDA antagonist, ketamine in excessive doses results in deficient Ca++ influx. This could be one of the reasons it leaves K-user in a state of disassociation.&quot;

				thanks DMtryp!<br /><br />Had to read that carefully a few times over. So K is effective in preventing tolerance and even damage; at least, as long as it&#039;s still blocking the calcium. depends on how long it sticks around up there I guess

				Dmtryptamine: Once again, thanks so much for offering your time and knowledge here. <br /><br />I am currently rather concerned after an experience I have had and hoping maybe you could offer some insight:<br /><br />Last tuesday and wednesday I did some pretty pure coke I bought from here on SR. Only 1 gram total for both days. I also had on hand, about 70-80 mgs of valium to help with the comedown and increased heartrate/nervousness. Besides having the valium on hand, having to do with history before taking the coke, I have also been taking 10 mg lexapro as well as 250mg Rhodiola Rosea 2x day for 2 years. Lexapro is an SSRI and rhodiola seems to be a dopamine/serotonin reuptake inhibitor as well (also read it could be a slight MAOI). But overall rhodiola has a very safe track record.<br /><br />So on the 2 days I did the 1 gram coke, I had taken my regular dosages of 10 mg lexapro and 500 mg rhodiola. Alongside those, I also ended up taking all of my valium (maybe 80-90mgs) as I hate the jitteryness of coke (do it for the euphoria) and I hate the comedown. <br /><br />The following days, starting thursday, up until now, I just feel so very very down, unable to feel back to my normal self and really unable to feel any sort of happiness. Just an overall feeling of shit basically. Like there was some overload of dopamine or serotonin maybe and some possible damage to synapses in my brain that are just not regenerating. I understand 1-2 days of rehab time is normal, but it is going on 4 days now and I still feel like shit. I have never felt like this after doing coke before in my life (but had not been on the lexapro/rhodiola combo) and I am feeling very very concerned that some kind of permanent damage might have taken place? Something to do with dopamine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors being maxed or damaged? OR could it just be I am still detoxing from all that valium? (4 days doesnt make sense though...) <br /><br />Do you think my brain could regenerate from this? Any ideas on what is going on? Should I stop taking the lexapro and rhodiola for a couple days to try and initiate a reset of my brain chemistry?<br /><br />Any feedback is massively appreciated.

				I have a few questions;<br /><br />1. Could using IV methamphetamine (generally about 0.1 g at a time) and an SNRI (Duroextine, I think) cause serotonin syndrome?<br /><br />2. In prepping IV Heroin is it better to add heat or not? Like with dope destruction, solubility and sterility arguments?<br /><br />3. How long can a dose of Fentanyl HCI Solution 0.5 mg/0.5 mL stay viable in-solution in a syringe? What I mean by viable is how long until it becomes a really significant health risk to use? Also the potency degrade over time, will it convert back to morphine like heroin?

				^^ Sorry I have not been on to answer your questions, computer problems...<br /><br />Methamphetamine does not act on serotonin to the degree that MDMA, or empathogens do. That said it does have some effect on it.<br />It could reduce the euphoria possibly, but I have not heard about it causing SS, although I could very well be wrong.<br /><br />I do not know much of anything about IVing heroin or fentanyl as I have personally never done it so I cannot answer that specific question.<br />
