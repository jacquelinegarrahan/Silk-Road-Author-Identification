				Hi all, I&#039;m new here and anxious to make my first order. My only issue is the fact that I would have to use my home address. How big of a problem is this? If it matters, I don&#039;t plan on ordering anything that has an odor. Cheers.

				I think a lot of people do use their home address, or a friend or relative&#039;s. It seems to be relatively low risk if you are ordering only small amounts (and not amounts that would indicate you are likely going to resell). However if the penalty seems high, people do get fake id&#039;s and then open a PO box, etc. That is not without risk though either, because then if you end up getting caught having used false identification that is just going to make your case even worse. Ordering smelly stuff isn&#039;t an issue if it&#039;s packaged properly. In the U.s. supposedly even if your package gets intercepted, often you&#039;ll get the package, but with the item removed and a &#039;love letter&#039; saying it was confiscated. If the return address is one they are trying to catch the actual sender, they might lean on you though for information.

				You said it, I think using your real name and address is ok, so long as you DON&#039;T order something that could possibly get sniffed out. Just remember NEVER SIGN!<br />Just say I was not expecting anything, refuse to sign and chalk the loss. Not talking from exp. I had the newb paranoia for a few weeks, but after a few good transactions it passes.

				You have to apply some sensible judgement.<br /><br />Firstly, be diligent in thoroughly researching your prospective supplier: you should be seeking to gain comfort not only on the quality of their product, but also on the stealth of their packaging (lack of which exposes you to more direct risk than it exposes them).&nbsp; Odors can be contained if the packaging is adequate: read the shipping board for more information.<br /><br />It&#039;s difficult to do this well, but some comfort can be gained from the feedback on their profile (bearing in mind that much could be from shills, I tend to read through ALL OF IT, even if it&#039;s across multiple pages, paying close attention to scores, words and dates - e.g. lots of good reviews a long time ago followed by more recent poor reviews would set alarm bells ringing, as would a cluster of recent shortly worded reviews all giving good marks; I tend to ignore FE feedback, except to note that the vendor may be requiring something I am not prepared to give) and, perhaps more importantly, by searching what has been said about the vendor on these forums.<br /><br />SR could do more to help in this regard, e.g. by providing TripAdvisor style charts (number of reviews at each score) or devising a network of trust model that detects shill accounts and/or weights scoring by the trustworthiness of the scorer.&nbsp; There&#039;s a ton of research in this field that I shan&#039;t cite here, as it&#039;s going off-topic.<br /><br />Secondly, you need to consider what action LE might take against you should your shipment be intercepted.&nbsp; If you&#039;re buying a small amount (i.e. obviously only sufficient for personal use) of a &quot;less harmful&quot; drug, then in SOME jurisdictions they may simply confiscate the contraband and replace with a letter informing you that is what has happened: no big deal, except insofar as you may now be on a list/watched a little closer.&nbsp; Perhaps using your home address in this case is tolerable to you; whereas others might decide they still want to invest time/effort/money in removing themselves a step further.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, if you&#039;re buying large quantities (i.e. obviously a major trafficker) of something deemed &quot;very harmful&quot; in a very strict jurisdiction, then you almost certainly won&#039;t want it coming to your home as interception will almost certainly lead to severe penalties.<br /><br />So, to answer your question &quot;How big of a problem is this?&quot; - it really depends on what you&#039;re doing.

				Thanks, catalan!<br /><br />I suppose it also depends on the risk of the stuff you&#039;re shipping getting intercepted in the first place. Something like LSD that can be put into a letter, I would think would be of the safest variety. Something stinky and bulky like weed, probably more risky. Would you more seasoned folks agree?

				Weed is not risky if it&#039;s packaged right. The mylar bags seem to be the way to go. The simple polyethylene vacuum sealer food bags alone, even three layers is NOT sufficient and seems to require a scenting agent like a dryer sheet, which is not a good idea. Use the right materials to package and it&#039;s fine.

				Weed may be fine, but it&#039;s still riskier than acid. But yeah, I&#039;ve never ordered weed but I hear it&#039;s safe. I think the thing you might want to watch out for is coke and dope. That&#039;s going to have more risk in it, because thats what LE really wants to crack down on.

				never use a fake name while sending to your address, USPS will realise that the receiver name has never gotten mail at that adress before and that will raise suspision.. if u deal with professional venders, ordering anything from weed to MDMA shud not be a problem what so ever with proper packaging.. i always avoid ordering&nbsp; internationally, always domestic to avoid customs!

				I myself have never had any problems, I order a lot of stuff off the internet anyways so there&#039;s at least 1 or 2 packets delivered to my home each day. So my SR orders are just bundled together with all the rest of the day&#039;s post and are completely unnoticed. We have the same postman each day so I always have my orders addressed the same as if it&#039;s come from eBay or somewhere..

				if you are too paranoid to put your name and address as a buyer, you should not be using SR.&nbsp; if you are receiving tons of stuff from SR, then maybe you should consider sending multiple places, but I would never use fake names or companies or things of this nature.&nbsp; It never works out well in the end.&nbsp; your best bet is to use a vendor that is trusted and explicitly destroys your contact info upon finalizing. then give them the real info and trust.

Of course they could. ;) Still... thoughts on delivering to a PO Box? Increased risk because you&#039;re inside a federal building? Or not a big deal? I&#039;m talking about LSD orders, for the most part, not anything stinky like weed, etc.

				I think with LSD the chances of getting caught are extremely low of course it depends on the vendor just pick a established one that has a solid track record and you should be fine just keep your house clean and if the cops come deny if there&#039;s no evidence other then that 1 package that was delivered under your name there&#039;s no case <br />Must have been sent to the wrong person ;)

				I used to order research chemicals and spores all the time.&nbsp; Started out using a mis-spelling of my name, which probably only reduced my security.&nbsp; Vast majority went to my name at my address.&nbsp; <br /><br />When the whole rc thing came crashing down, I got all paranoid, cleaned house and waited to go to jail.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp; To this day, I&#039;m sorry I threw out my 2c-e before I got a chance to try it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Granted, at the time those chems were only ambiguously illegal.&nbsp; And I rather doubt they&#039;d trained dogs to sniff 2-ct-21. But then, the websites were right out there in the open, and there was no stealth mailing then.&nbsp; Open the envelope and a bunch of little zip-lock bags filled with white powder come falling out.&nbsp; Return address is &quot;Freds Fine Chemicals.&quot;&nbsp; Nothing suspicious about that!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />Back then, the government didn&#039;t have the ability to profile you by your internet traffic like it does now.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp; don&#039;t think it&#039;s mail security we have to worry about; it&#039;s internet security.&nbsp; Given the number of times I&#039;ve accessed mises dot 0rg and cheaperndirt, I&#039;m sure I have a profile a mile long.&nbsp; Read Eye of Moloch; we are probably there already and just don&#039;t know it.&nbsp; <br /><br />You and me, we&#039;re not on the radar.&nbsp; Our beloved pirate is, and I hope they never catch him.&nbsp; If they do, we&#039;ve lost more than drugs.&nbsp; Liberty is an endangered species these days.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, I know I&#039;m likely not on the radar, but still... I like to be careful and assume I AM on the radar nonetheless. Keeps me from actually being on the radar. :)
