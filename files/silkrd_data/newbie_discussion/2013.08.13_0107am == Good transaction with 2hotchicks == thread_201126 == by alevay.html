				I have been on the road for over a year now and have dons a few dozen transactions. It had been awhile and I did not have a lot of cash, so I went the RC route and ordered from 2hotchicks.<br /><br />Order: .5 MDPV, .25 Methylone<br />Price: Under $20 (including shipping)<br />Quality: Good<br />Shipping Time: Very Good (3 days to Central US)<br />Stealth: Fair, could use improvement<br />Communication: Good<br /><br />The products weigh spot on, very potent. I am no expert, but for the price I am very satisfied and feeling very good. For such a small order from a busy vendor they got me my product very fast and even had the time to send a response to my message, even though none was required.<br /><br />I do not know if these guys are just relabeled vendors or new, I do not really care. They did as advertised and per our agreement, were quick with their order and the package was acceptable.<br /><br />If you are new, I would recommend these guys as a good place to start. You can bust your cherry for a minimal amount of cash and the product is legit and from the US, which to me is very important, as I have very little positive results from across the pond. They use the escrow system, so your risk is very minimal. They look as though they have a big operation, so they probably have your needs ready to ship.<br /><br />I do want to take this opportunity to thank them and wish them much success.<br /><br />PS, in the sake of fairness and to eliminate any thoughts I may be bias in any way, I also recommend FiberOptic as well if you are going the RC route or Hammertime if you want Meth...10 toes is a very good coke guy....
