				I&#039;ve been looking into it and right now XXXotica seems pretty God Damn loved by the community but he currently doesn&#039;t have the strains I am looking for. HappySmoke420 also looks very good and has stellar reviews. I saw a guy called anonymart who has a massive amount of supposedly medical strains, but there are no review threads on him. Can anybody help me out here? Who&#039;s got great Medical Weed, fast and stealth delivery and great prices?

				I haven&#039;t signed up for my Silk Road vendors account yet (probably early next week), but I&#039;m the #1 cannabis vendor on Atlantis right now and you can get my product through there. Otherwise I&#039;ll be posting ads early next week on Silk Road. You can find my Atlantis Vendor Page through the link in my signature.

				XXXotica has his shit together. I&#039;m with ya though, wish he was able to offer more strains. <br /><br />Personally, I would like to find a vendor that I can order an oz variety pack of 1/4s of different strains. <br /><br />

				Het dontek, anonymart has a good listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/5ea8a940c7. But I think you have to scour through his other listings to find the strains he offers in order to choose.
