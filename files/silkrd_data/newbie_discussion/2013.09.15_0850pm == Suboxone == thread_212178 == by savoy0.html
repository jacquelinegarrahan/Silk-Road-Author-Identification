			<dd class="postbody">
				Hey guys.. so i have been thinking about becoming a vendor for suboxone.. I have a huge supply of them that come in monthly and i never even use them so im just stocked up on them. Is there a high demand for them ? who would buy? Its very expensive to become a vendor so im trying to figure out if its worth it. I would love to go on and beat out everyone elses prices sine they are so much higher than what i would sell them for. I also on top of having 8mg strips i have the 12mg strips that i see no one has on the site which is a plus.`

				There is definitely a market for it and if you sold significantly lower than others, you should do well.&nbsp; I just bought 3 8mg. strips and paid $50 (!) for them.&nbsp; I will use them to detox at some point.&nbsp; I would have bought more, and might still, except that the price is rather high.&nbsp; &nbsp;
