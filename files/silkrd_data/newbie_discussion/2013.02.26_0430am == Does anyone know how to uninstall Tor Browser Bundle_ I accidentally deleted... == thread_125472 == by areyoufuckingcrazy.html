				Umm... I don&#039;t know what Chrome is doing.&nbsp; It might be accessing your Mozilla plugins from the Tor browser, I really have no clue frankly.&nbsp; But basically, all you need to do is..... nothing.<br /><br />Yeah, nothing.&nbsp; You&#039;re on the Tor network right now.&nbsp; You wouldn&#039;t be able to post otherwise.<br />

				Oh, yeah yeah, the tor2web thing.&nbsp; Got it.<br /><br />There&#039;s no actual install for the bundle, you just... uncompress it somewhere, and run &quot;start-tor-browser&quot; -- so just download it again, restart your computer, and then run it.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t work, you need to provide more info like the log output of an error or something.&nbsp; Otherwise it could be anything and nobody can help you.<br />

				... actually... ya know.&nbsp; You could.&nbsp; Seriously, it&#039;s not illegal to access SR or Tor.&nbsp; I mean I&#039;m sure the guy would tell stories about it for years to come and everything, but they&#039;re under no obligation to report it as far as I know&nbsp; ;D

				If I were trying to access SR through the methods that uses that torbrowser, I would put it down. And I started with it.

Yeah so I got a service job to help get tor running. I had no idea what hell that was so I went out to the house for the service call and this dude was all acting crazy scratching every few seconds like he drank to much coffee. Well anyhow not knowing what the hell he was talking about he starts telling how you can use this crazy web type thing to access the dark net. Well anyways I went through it with him and he took me to the link to download this thing call TOR from tor.org. I got it all installed and the page that comes up is welcome to the TOR you are now browsing securely. I was like wow well there you go, what all can you do with it. So hes like well check this out and types in some funky random crap, it was http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion he logs in and bam the damn thing was filled with drugs he said you could get anything I could ever want. Well naturally I was intrerested so I went home and got all started&nbsp; into this thing I had never knew was around. Learned about bit coin and got sucked into all the porn and not just porn wholly fucking porn horses dog things a person should never see. Needless to say I lost my job got hooked on crank and heroin speed balls........ So this is my 45 minute being sober&nbsp; :-*

				I am here for the finest of greenssssss. In my younger years I fucked with all that hard shit. Did my time, I like some vicodins or something like that now and again, but. I like to think I know the man I am today, not that punk I was yesterday. My point is. You gotta proceed with caution. If you get something and you really really like it, and it is highly addictive. Prob should wait almost a year before going at it again.<br /><br />This is just me though. Drugs are a hell of a drug yo.
