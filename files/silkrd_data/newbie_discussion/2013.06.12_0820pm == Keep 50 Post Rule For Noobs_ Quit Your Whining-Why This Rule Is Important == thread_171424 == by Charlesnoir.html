				Some thoughts on the 50 Post rule for Newbies and the Forums:<br /><br />In No Particular Order of Importance<br /><br />-Having to make 50 posts gets Noobs to become familiar the forums<br />-Reading the forums is important for information exchange and an education of all things SR<br />-Keeps the repetitive Noob questions in one place allowing the other forums to be free of static<br />-Encourages interaction for Noobs and other members in a forum where they can ask any Noob question without trepidation of seeming Noobish<br /><br />For those who have been around awhile but have not posted to 50...Why Not?&nbsp; Your input as a member would be appreciated.&nbsp; You most likely have a lot to offer by sharing your experiences.<br /><br />For those who &quot;Spam to 50&quot;:&nbsp; Your Loss.<br />You are cheating yourself out of a learning experience.<br />You are also, generally speaking, impatient and looking for the easy way out and it shows. It will be even more glaring when you spam to 50 and start some irritating, ignorant rant in the other forums.&nbsp; This leads to the question I would want to know about you as a buyer or seller:&nbsp; <br />What other shortcuts do you take in life?<br /><br />All comments are appreciated.

				I agree.&nbsp; I posted once in a &quot;spam to 50&quot; and got 2 negative karma.&nbsp; Its a bit frustrating, there&#039;s been a few times I wanted to add in to a discussion outside of the Newbie forum but I can wait until I&#039;ve got over 50.

Seriously.<br /><br />It hit home with me when you said, &quot;what other shortcuts do you take in life?&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you said what you said even though it hurts to think about because you&#039;ve caused some genuine self-examination.<br /><br />Ugh.

				I joined SR and the forum back at the end of 2011. The 50 post rule didn&#039;t exist. Then I didn&#039;t use the forum for a while...months I figure...and when I came back I couldn&#039;t figure out why I couldn&#039;t post any more. <br /><br />I generally agree with the original post.

				I think that 50 posts should only apply to potential spammers and vendors should be able to post anywhere they want right away.&nbsp; &nbsp;A vendor can&#039;t even start a review thread before they spam to 50.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would take forever to get to 50 without spamming and all those non-spam posts reveal too much info.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like to keep my post count near 50 by regularly deleting the non-spam posts.&nbsp;

				I kind of see your point here. I am all in about learning and becoming familiar with the forum.<br /><br />To tell the truth I also used those spam threads to achieve the 50 posts but the only reason I did it was because I wanted to send a feedback about some products I recently bought. I am sure that this 50 post rules is acceptable and understandable by all but on the other hand I am sure lots of possible good feedbacks have not been written just because they couldn&#039;t send in those threads. And finally, some people are quite happy and get a lot of info just by reading the forum. It would be nice to say sometimes your opinion or thoughts and for that reason I am not unhappy I &quot;used&quot; those spam thread to get my 50 posts. And you really know how long this takes through the tor network :)<br /><br />All the best people!

				As a complete SR newbie, I get it. But for someone like me who registered on SR to make a purchase it&#039;s a little annoying to be stuck in the newbie forum. I get why it&#039;s necessary, cuts way down on spammers etc. Still annoying for the non-spam contingent.<br /><br />Plus I like to mostly lurk forums and this puts a nix on that.

				I agree aside from how high the number is. Wouldn&#039;t cutting down the number, down to say 25 still preform the same intended purpose? PLus, I think if it was a more reasonable number a lot more people would be willing to do it without spamming.

				Do I think 50 posts is pretty steep? Sure... but unfair? Not really.<br /><br />I just found this place by accident a few days ago while searching for a supplier of 2C-B using DuckDuckGo, Chrome, and Orbot on an Android phone. A late night of study had led me to Tor, TAILS and SR... which led to another late night of forum browsing and gawking at the wares available on SR. I&#039;m now attempting to navigate PGP Encryption and access to BitCoins. Once I have all of that settled, I plan to make my 1st purchase some 2C-B for me and my sweetie and some Real MDMA. Hopefully none of that bunk shit I&#039;ve been trying sporatically over the last 15 years. Haven&#039;t had a good honest Roll in ages. I&#039;m looking forward to all this.<br /><br />...which leads to my point. I&#039;m still a little overwhelmed by the extreme in-your-face audacity of The Silk Road. As someone who only wishes to occationally procure rather minute amounts of controlled substances for personal recreational use, and who already is accustomed to receiving many small and varied personal packages at work, SR is a dream come true! The very fact that I&#039;m gonna be able to trade cash for these digital things called &quot;BitCoins&quot; (I read all about them; ingenious) and then trade them for Good Drugs... online... sent straight to my door...<br /><br />Holy Shit Ladies and Gentlemen, the future has arrived.<br /><br />Of course, I&#039;m cautious by nature. Being comfortable with boot environments, I went for the TAILS option. Then after registering I read the forum for 2 days and now I&#039;m 1st posting. Lots of good info here. Plenty of great answers and advice, if people would just slow down and read. I&#039;m anxious to place a first order, but I&#039;m pacing myself, trying to absorb all the info I need to Be Smart and Play Safe. Just like I did with Erowid way back when before I tried 2C-T-7, Salvia Divinorum, Ayahuasca, Hawaiian Wood Rose, and many others.<br /><br />Speaking of, I&#039;m currently about to birth 12 substrate jars of Koh Sumoi &#039;shrooms for the first time in many years. Just 12 jars on rotation with a small terrarium in a closet can net you a half pound of dried, powdered &#039;shrooms in a year&#039;s time. That shit&#039;s easy to do in your kitchen. Give it a try if you haven&#039;t already.<br /><br />They can call me a newbie all they want, just as long as I get easy access to Good Drugs... no more of this bunk street shit. Spend $100 dealin&#039; with kids half my age just to get a 1/4 Roll from 3 tabs of &quot;X&quot;. Bullshit. If this is the worst obsticle of the forum, then great. I&#039;m a newbie. Woot Woot.<br /><br />I read Shulgin&#039;s PIKAL many years ago, and have wanted to try 2C-B ever since (it was his and his wife&#039;s personal favorite. He called it the closest thing to an actual aphrodisiac that he had ever encountered... and as the inventor of MDMA and every other phenelamine, he&#039;s encountered plenty). It would seem that now&#039;s my chance. Thanx Silk Road, you are quickly becoming dear to my heart.
