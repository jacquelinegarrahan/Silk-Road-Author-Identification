				So I&#039;m completely new to SR, I&#039;ve known of it for about a year, but I&#039;ve lived abroad, with a decent dealer literally living next door, with good prices, good products and a very friendly tone. So I haven&#039;t found the need to use SR, for as long as I&#039;ve known of it. And I wasn&#039;t really positive to the concept. That is, until now.<br />When I first heard of SR, and checked it out, I have to admit. I was actually repulsed by the idea of how easy it could be to buy hard drugs. I was a textbook &quot;weed is ok, anything else is going to ruin your life. And I hate that it&#039;s on the same black market as something as harmless as weed&quot; type of guy. I was under the impression of SR being filled with dumb people, thinking that they wouldn&#039;t get caught, throwing an ounce of weed in a letter, and shoving it in a mailbox. &quot;sleezy scumbags&quot;, from the biggest criminal organizations out there, was the other extreme, I thought the site could be filled with. I had been on the site before, spending 10 minutes browsing some products, not taking the time to read customer reviews, product info or really anything but the pictures of the product.&nbsp; I was very quick to judge, and denied what my friends said about SR being really professional.<br /><br />When I came back to my Country of origin, I found myself really bored, and wanted something to browse, to make time pass. After smoking crappy hash, and getting sick of watching watching youtube vids of people smoking the same quality I got used to, abroad. I found myself downloading tor, and browsing SR. It didn&#039;t take long before I actually started reading about the different products I was looking at. And although the info varies from vendor to vendor. I very positively surprised by the professionalism of a lot of these vendors. Anywhere from the packaging they&#039;ve described to quality control, and customer service. Taking the illegality of the products I&#039;ve been looking at, it&#039;s obvious that you&#039;re not going to have reviews from New York Post, and so on. But the amount of feedback given in the customer reviews, almost seemed overwhelming. I was especially impressed with vendors, having comments about vendors making up for mistakes. Like taking a day longer than planned to ship the product, being compensated with significant overweight. And the overall will to give the best service possible, from the vendors.<br /><br />I have yet to fully figure out how to get bitcoins, I was introduced to it at the same time I started browsing SR again. I&#039;m very new to the concept, and bitcoin merchants, but I love the concept of the anonymity of the currency. But most of all, I love how the value of bitcoins work, compared to any other currency out there. I really do like the challenge of figuring all of this out, and am looking forward to make my first order on SR.<br /><br />Now, over to the thing about SR that really completed my first impression of SR, the forum. I was amazed by the community that the forum is providing. Unlike the usual forums I hang around in, people seem far more willing to help others. Whether that&#039;s helping a newbie through his first order, to offering full assistance to help someone learn about PGP encryption. Not to mention the most amazing and detailed product reviews, that you won&#039;t find on the trade market. I haven&#039;t been through the entire forum, so I can&#039;t say this for sure. But I have yet to see the immature posts you very often find in forums. And it&#039;s obvious to me that the people here, are serious. Although I&#039;ve smoked for over 3 years (Yeah, I know I&#039;m still a rookie compared to a lot of you), I&#039;ve only been buying from friends that have been selling a bit on the side, from having a legit 9 to 5 job. I have to say that I&#039;m amazed by the customer service the vendors here seem to provide. It has blown my mind, reading about the lengths some of these vendors are willing to go, in order to give the best possible service and product.<br /><br />This was just my first impression of SR, I&#039;ve been looking at if for 4 days, and it&#039;s clear to me that there&#039;s a lot more to learn about this community. If anyone else would like to share their first impression of SR, go ahead and throw it in here. Also, if you have any questions that this post didn&#039;t answer, feel free to ask them. I want to reach 50 posts on the forum, and be given access to post on the other forums. But I don&#039;t want to spam with meaningless posts, just to get the amount of posts up. I&#039;ll be updating on my experience with SR, as it develops.<br />

				I first came here as I was bored one day months ago and decided I&#039;d find out how to get to Silk Road after hearing about it from a couple people online. It seemed more like a novelty at first, especially when I saw crack and heroin, all I could think was &quot;Yeah, ok let&#039;s see you guys actually ship it through the postal service.&quot; Was I ever wrong in thiking that.<br /><br />I could pay a lot more for weed and as I don&#039;t smoke it the different types mean nothing to me really. I could buy mushrooms, also for quite a bit more, but it was actually the main selling point for me here. Yes, I can buy mushrooms local, once or twice a year and only a pound at a time, no more and I would be asking my dealer for it every week. The convenience of being able to buy mushrooms here, any time of the year is perfect for me. I&#039;ve also been trying to get LSD and Mescaline for around 2 years now, most people in my town don&#039;t even know what Mescaline is, I guess I&#039;m in a pretty remote place.<br /><br />Then one day I called my partner, met up with him for drinks and said &quot;Hey, we need to get this stuff in town, and I know how.&quot; It was such a pain to get bitcoins and I didn&#039;t order for about 2 more weeks. Now that I have had a few successful transactions and only one that isn&#039;t going so well, I am looking forward to being here for a long time.<br /><br />Mescaline still seems hard to come by though.<br /><br />Welcome to SR though, and I hope you enjoy your stay.

From what I&#039;ve read, the value of bitcoins have gone up drastically the last few years. It seems like it would&#039;ve been a nice investment, to make some legal money from. Being as new to this as I am, and not remembering the prices on products from when I browsed for 10 minutes a year ago. The prices for products tend to go down (in bitcoin price that is), as the value of them go up, am I right?<br />

				I been actually on it for about 8 months. Lost an old forum account so had to result to making a new one sadly. I never did though make a transaction cause I was abroad a few weeks of making the old account so really didn&#039;t matter. I was excited to have access to the site. Was awesome when I first logged on. Still is!

				First impression was my fucking jaw on the floor. I read the Wired article about SR and was genuinely shocked that something like this. DPR is a fucking genius for running this in the face of LE and still keeping it online. 12 years in HS ago my friends and I were ordering 2CT-7 and a bunch of 5-MEOs from some shady Chinese websites before the shit was illegal. This definitely reminds me of those days, but you can get EVERYTHING here. If this were around when I was younger and reckless I would have gotten in so much more trouble hahahaha.

				The first time I heard about SR was maybe a year or so ago, in a passing conversation whilst reallllyy baked - just a mention of the deep web and &quot;this site that you can buy ANY drug on&quot;. Fastforward to about a month ago, and I meet a guy who&#039;s in on it and he tells me some more information and my interest was pretty big by then. I took all the necessary steps to making the process safe and now I&#039;m here, awaiting the delivery of my first two orders! :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve moved to an area recently where I don&#039;t have any links and I don&#039;t know if I&#039;d trust any sellers, so finding SR is a dream come true. Products from consistently consumer-rated vendors at fantastic prices (with MDMA we&#039;re talking approaching 50% cheaper than street sale value in my area) and in a secure setting.<br /><br />SR is going to allow me to have fantastic times with friends (and strangers!) in a way that is cheaper, safer and more trustworthy than any other available option. I just hope I can give back to the community as much as possible by providing as many reviews as possible and helping fellow newcomers out whenever possible.<br /><br />Hopefully this is the first post of many :)

				I am a weed guy myself. For me I was like a kid in a candy store. What should I buy? I must have spend a several&nbsp; hours reading different listings, going through vendor pages, and looking at vendor feedback. I got the buying jitters but mustered up the courage to place an order.<br />Sweated it out until the product arrived. <br />Now I figure I could get caught by LE driving home with my weed from a deal.

				the part with the bitcoins made me angry too. It really depends what country you live in. Because I live in Romania, every time I buy bitcoins, 10 euros go to the bank, as there are no over the counter methods here sadly.

				It is impressive, I would love to see some enhancements to the site from a usability standpoint but I am certainly not complaining!!!!&nbsp; Once I hit my 50 I can post them somewhere will it will count.
