				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/e3be84fe3d<br /><br />415.00 moneypak conversion.&nbsp; Ripped. See ya later 400 bucks.&nbsp; <br /><br />This guy told me that GREENDOT was needing info from him before he could convert it.&nbsp; The next day, the moneypak is gone/cashed out.&nbsp; He hasn&#039;t responded since and I don&#039;t expect him to. this is 5 days now. Its really shitty that people sit on their ass on here and jack peoples money..especially when people work hard for their money. <br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know if I want to scream scam yet.&nbsp; He does have 100% rating, although hardly any transactions.&nbsp; I gave him my MP#s two days ago worth 820.&nbsp; He responded to the first message saying &quot;I&#039;m really backed up bro, I&#039;ll get it to you with no charge sorry about the wait.&quot;&nbsp; They have been redeemed and I have no BTC as of yet.&nbsp; I am very pissed at this point, but am still leaving the possibility open that he is a new vendor who cashed a bunch of MPs and didn&#039;t have enough BTC.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t receive these coins in a few more days I will be very fucking pissed off.&nbsp; It is very discouraging that another SRer is having the same issue and has been waiting even longer than I have.&nbsp; <br />Do scammers have a way to up their stats?&nbsp; Like do they just get a bunch of friends to register and post a bunch of rave reviews or what?&nbsp; Why doesn&#039;t SR at least have a quasi way of dealing with this?&nbsp; Like, if over 20 users say they got their moneypaks stolen, then a btc vendor gets removed and their account frozen?&nbsp; <br />This guy is no bueno even if I get my coins.&nbsp; cashing out early is fucking poor taste.&nbsp;

				using MP to bitcoin is always dangerous unless u build trust with the guy.&nbsp; i realize your doing it for anonymity but theres other methods that are just as safe.&nbsp; look for vendors that have 100+ transactions.&nbsp; someone can easily forge a dozen or more.&nbsp; check forums before dealing there is always a review somewhere of someone good. ALso try small increments at first 820 is a lot to drop as a newbie

				I am not a newb on SR.&nbsp; I have always used bitinstant, but they have stopped allowing transfers TO a btc address.&nbsp; So I went with a SR btc vendor.&nbsp; I have come to learn that there is now such thing as a good sr btc vendor, so I went with the lowest rate.&nbsp; <br />Do you really think that one could get 100% on over 35 transactions, then turn scam?&nbsp; Is there a policy in place to ban BTC scammers?<br />btw, the Taur&#039;i always win!

				Findnell is most DEFINITELY a scammer.&nbsp; Hes not even reading my messages..going on 7 days of waiting for him to convert it. I had a couple friends on here shoot him a message to see if he was converting mps to btc, and sure enough HE IS...he will totally snag your cash and you can count on that being the last time you hear from him.&nbsp; I have sent numerous messages to him and he hasnt even read one of them. <br /><br />That guy is a scam. But if youd like to find out for yourself, give him a moneypak.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; <br /><br />Stick with BTCpal or sugarmama

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124499.0<br />I just saw that I had one new message.&nbsp; Then when I clicked inbox, SR was down.&nbsp; Possibly to fix this glitch?&nbsp; And maybe this could be the problem with this BTC vendor?&nbsp; I hope that was the only issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the issue really was with the btc wallet service, I&#039;m going to feel REALLY bad about the messages I sent this guy....

				What we need is a medium in the exchange.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t we have a psuedo-escrow option.&nbsp; For example.&nbsp; Somebody sets up a vendor account.&nbsp; Their entire job is to provide trade security between btc vendors and buyers.&nbsp; For say 1-2%, they hold the moneypak number, verify that the money is on the moneypak, then give a nod to the vendor to release the coins.&nbsp; Then, the moneypak number is given to the vendor.&nbsp; Why not?

				My head is level on my shoulders, and I am not fucking findnell, dickhead.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; over 800 dollars in fucking limbo right now.&nbsp; I have sent the asshead several messages that he has not read.&nbsp; I think he is an unprofessional vendor if he is online and not reading his messages.&nbsp; There *IS* an issue with SR right now, where people have been reporting missing BTC and non-successful withdrawals and transfers that were still showing up on the blockchain.&nbsp; Fucking sue me for being optimistic about my money issue being the result of a technical issue that could be fixed.&nbsp; You sound like a pompous ass without the ability to copy and paste a url and has sand in his vagina.&nbsp; <br />If findnell took my money, he&#039;s a fucking dickhead.&nbsp; Nothing I can do to get it back.&nbsp; But his listings need to be removed if that is the case, so it doesn&#039;t happen to others.&nbsp; DPH hasnt even addressed the btc ewallet issue yet to my knowledge.&nbsp; Sorry about your 400 bucks, man.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be losing double if it&#039;s a scam, asshat.&nbsp;

				I have to ask ... why would you drop so much cash on a single transaction? I know you don&#039;t want to hear that but ... Yeah, I definitely would have researched before dropping nearly two (of my) weeks pay on something like this that isn&#039;t protected by SR!

				I don&#039;t know about the bitcoin issue but SR is up and running. No problems with messages that I know of. <br /><br />I was afraid of this when bitinstant went down. Hope they will be back up monday so people can get their coins. <br /><br />There are only two vendors I would even consider getting bitcoin for money packs. Sugar mama and bluesky traders. I have never personally used them but by the respect they have in the forum is near perfect. <br /><br />Once you work outside of escrow there is nothing SR can do to help you. They can&#039;t really police the side deals that go on. <br /><br />Sorry to hear what you guys are going through. Hope it works out for you and is just a glitch in the system.
