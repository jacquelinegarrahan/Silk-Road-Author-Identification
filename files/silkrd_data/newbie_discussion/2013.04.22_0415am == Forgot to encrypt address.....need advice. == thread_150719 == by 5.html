				This is my 1st post, I have several transaction go smoothly then today not even thinking I sent an order an forgot to encrypt the address. Its all good, sent vendor a message to put in transit asap an I will F/E to get address out of system an then sent to different address this time encrypted. Now I&#039;m really upset at myself cause im worried I compromised a very convenient address. I know SR does something to protect you somewhat if you dont use pgp. Could LE have seen that by any chance? it took a couple hrs to to F/E an get address out of system. Please anyone who knows is it safe to use address again that was not encrypted. any advice would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Many thanks,<br />5

				Hi! My first post as well! Haha<br /><br />Anyhow, to the issue...<br />The system is tuned so the only ppl to see your address, even unencrypted, is you and the vendor. I think there&#039;s something in the wiki that explains the protections in place already to the address &#039;hand-off&#039; system.<br /><br />Encrypting it w/ PGP is a step you can take to make 1000% sure that it can&#039;t be intercepted. I think that the SR system is pretty ironclad as is. I wouldn&#039;t stress too badly, just be sure to encrypt it from this transaction forth for the peace of mind. :D<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />EDIT - Further reassuring info...<br /><br />Here&#039;s the info direct from SR (see link below). According to the wiki (like you mentioned) from the point you submit an order till the vendor reads it it is encrypted by the site and NOT EVEN SR STAFF CAN READ IT. Once the vendor confirms the item has shipped the address is irretrievably deleted. So like I said before, the system is damn secure so you needn&#039;t worry too much about sending it as is. Just PGP encrypt it in the future so you can sleep a bit better at night. lol<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Buyer%27s_Guide#Receiving_address<br /><br />P.S. Also, be careful with FE, lots of people say never to do it, because from what I hear reputable vendors shouldn&#039;t require it. I have heard many stories of people being screwed by FE. I guess if the vendor is super reputable it might be ok, as I&#039;ve also seen very reputable vendors ask FE of everyone. Just be careful, FE makes you vulnerable to exploitation.

				Thanks guys, :)<br />yea, this the only transaction I have F/E on because I freaked out when I hit send then realized my stoned ass forgot to encrypt. All I could think was get this out of system have to finalize now. Its being sent to different address now. Yea I believe some newbies don&#039;t even bother to learn encryption. I felt like I was back in college studying for a test. I had to learn to encrypt, find a clean house to send product to an all that security stuff before I made my 1st transaction. Anyways my mind is at ease now&nbsp; 8)

				I did the same thing on the first transaction and freaked out myself.<br /><br />So I just made a new account, and from that point on I was sure to PGP encrypt all the following messages. I recommend doing the same since its only 1 transaction ;)

				I&#039;d start by burning down the address/location.<br />Next destroy all computer hardware/any material associated with anything to do with anything.<br />Drop off current illegal substance stash at nearest pet shelter for volunteer workers.<br />Burn finger tips, knock out all your teeth, move countries and acquire new identity.<br />Restart SR<br /><br /><br />JK! You should be fine. But that 3rd step might actually be really appreciated by some people lol.
