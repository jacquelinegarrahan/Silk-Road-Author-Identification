				No thank god. I&#039;ve been arrested twice, both times it was I just was being retarded. First time everything got dropped, spent the night in jail, got out the next morning, never had court. Second time was a MIP (drinking underage). I was 20, blacked out and an officer arrested me outside. Went on probation for that one and after that everything was dropped after I payed all the fees of course.

				Was very close to being convicted. As much as I hate the authorities, my jurisdiction has first time offender diversion programs and thankfully was able to expunge it. This theoretically saved my life from being of the felon status, which I am thankful for, but from this experience have come to the conclusion that the US justice system is very flawed, biased and in need of complete overhauling. However, that is a rant that doesn&#039;t belong on this particular thread.&nbsp; ;)

				Yup - had a POS lawyer and if I ever see that twat I would say hello, smile and slap his face off.<br />Never again though, have a great high priced jewish fella on speed dial who loves taking my money and the only words I hear him speak when we meet is &quot; You got my money?&quot; and &quot;This is bullshit, have a seat&quot; I can&#039;t help to be entertained and impressed as he just starts yelling at people or it just might be his natural tone..He&#039;s worth every damn penny as he&#039;s gotten me out of some pretty serious stuff. The moral of this short story, shell out the cash and find a very good lawyer...It&#039;s not fun being a felon.

				I went to court but only got a caution. It was for something done while drunk. The judge pretty much threw it out saying &quot;You&#039;re an idiot but really this should not of even came before the courts, and being drunk is no excuse. Now get the hell out of here and if see you before me again you will get a big fine and criminal record&quot;<br /><br />I look back now and realise how lucky I was, I didn&#039;t have any money at the time so didn&#039;t get a lawyer or anything, didn&#039;t even think about it. However even the prosecutor wanted to help me saying &quot;He has a clean record and a part time job and he is doing school full time as well&quot; Maybe it helped that I showed remorse and pleaded guilty straight up?

				Convicts fo&#039; life dawg!&nbsp; Whoop Whoop!<br /><br />All sillyness aside, I&#039;ve been a convicted felon since the age of 18.&nbsp; Sentenced at 19 and did a little bit of time for cultivation.&nbsp; Thats a possible life sentence where I live.&nbsp; 10 years probation and I&#039;m halfway through with flying colors (this includes 2 polygraph tests every year) despite smoking bud daily and being caught with a half lb about 3 years into probation.&nbsp; Finding out that certain cops are dirty really pays off ;) Other charges include Concealing stolen stuff, burglary, and other shit.&nbsp; NONE of which being a violent crime.
