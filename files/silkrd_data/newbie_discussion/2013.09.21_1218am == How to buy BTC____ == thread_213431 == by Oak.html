				So is that different from just regular local bitcoins?? Do you have to meet them in person? I have used local bitcoins in the past but didn&#039;t really know wth I was doing and ended up paying a fortune, I was able to just make a deposit at the local bank........I guess convenience is very expensive!! LOL Wish I could figure out how to become a BTC broker!! ;D ;D ;D

				I just used LocalBitcoins and paid only 3% more than SR bitcoin value. Cash deposit.<br /><br />You might wanna browse the forum a bit. There are plenty of information-filled threads on this exact subject. :)

				Personally what I do is fund my paypal account (if you MUST use cash then go to the nearest convenience store and buy a money pack giftcard and fund it), buy some second life dollars on this site called VIRWOX and then trade the second life dollars for bitcoins. This gets you a very good exchange rate (typically I only lose about 5%) and its VERY convenient. Obviously its not extremely anonymous and I would only do this for relatively small amounts of money but you simply cannot beat the convenience.

				If you need them fast you can use virwox as i takes paypal and creditcard. A bit of work since you have to deposit -&gt; buy SLL with USD -&gt; buy BTC with SLL. And then there are some annoying fees.<br /><br />Otherwise bitstamp is my favourite.

				Find a miner on localbitcoins. <br />Check profiles for someone who will meet in person.<br />Set up blockchain wallet and DL app.<br />Meet miner in public with wireless, <br />Miner verifies currency to be converted<br />Miner then scans your QR code for wallet,<br />10 seconds later your phone or laptop goes ding! <br /><br />Started at 8% fee with relationship now down to 5% - I expect 4% soon<br />Doesn&#039;t have to be a miner. <br /><br />Oh guys like mine are not going to have feedback since the escrow system was not used and frankly it just one more place to be like making random posts.
