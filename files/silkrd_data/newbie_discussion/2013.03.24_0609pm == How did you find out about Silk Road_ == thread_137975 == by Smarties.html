				Myself it was by chance actually. Before SR I&#039;d been about five years without taking my favorite party drug MDMA. Used to indulge every other weekend at one time but coupled with most of the clubs I went to closing down and my street sources drying up I&#039;d been without for it for quite some time.<br /><br />Then about a year ago I began getting into magic truffles. Truffles being a legal alternative to shrooms (in most countries outside USA) for anyone unaware and can be easily purchased online. They were OK. They enhanced the music and filled the void to a certain extent but I still missed my ecstasy.<br /><br />So, seemingly giving up finding an XTC source, I went on a bit of a fact finding mission to discover what other legal highs there was out there.<br /><br />I became particularly interested in peyote / mescaline. I&#039;d learnt that the high of this drug was somewhat similar to a cross between XTC and LSD. But that&#039;s as far as I got because one Sunday evening whilst browsing the comments of a meacaline vid on You Tube I suddenly saw someone mentioning this site so I checked it out and I&#039;m happy to say I&#039;ve not looked back since.<br /><br />I&#039;ve still got several sources for street weed but I mostly order that online now as well. You simply can&#039;t beat the wide variety of choice available here on SR. Plus I&#039;m living 10 miles outside town these days so traveling just to buy weed was always a pain. Especially the times when I used to go and nobody had any or they&#039;d keep you waiting an hour or so as they were expecting their drop off from the bigger dealer.<br /><br />This site really has been a god send. DPR you are a legend. Power to the people!!!

				I met someone about 6 months ago at a night club and started chatting it up with them, ended up becoming good friends and through that was shown the path to the road. Mannnn has it changed my life... I love me some MDMA and realized the shit i was being sold was methylone. Needless to say the drugs i now consume are top notch, competitively priced and delivered to my door within days&nbsp; ;D

				I found out about Feb 27 this year, and I&#039;ve been reading and involved (using) ever since. God, I thought I&#039;d have to give up on the drug scene. It involved too many compromises, worry about being ripped off, worrying about driving in car, whatever. <br />I think I saw something on the internet about SR, either directly or somebody writing that you could score over the internet, and about the anonymity and safety. Then I read the gawker&#039;s article and many others. BTC research, PGP research etc. <br />This is an incredible place, and IMO this idea (cryptography, and BTC) is really changing things. Although users are kind of a low percentage of the population, I think that they will help drive BTC prices up and a lot of people are investing in BTC now. The governments are debasing currency as fast as possible (and the US is helping big time. I think that we&#039;re squandering the fact that the dollar is the reserve currency and when it isn&#039;t any longer, it&#039;s going to get bad in the US, especially for the &#039;have nots&#039;) and people are looking for things like gold, silver and currency that could be a standard for money. Biggest thing for me is the fact that BTC doesn&#039;t depend on government at all (although I expect the US to soon expand it attempts at control, &#039;for the children&#039; of course)<br />I think Pine mentioned that eventually, since SR is truly multinational, that this system is going to drive efficiency and lower prices for the things that we love. <br />The US has had draconian laws for drugs for about 1/2 of a century, and the politicians have been falling over themselves trying to be tougher on &#039;crime&#039; (there is no need to classify drug use as criminal-but a whole generation is convinced that drug use is criminal) than the next guy. Looking back, it will be clear where the drug war changed for the better (although it may be criminal for years to come and nobody knows when it will end) the amount of money that the US spends is incredible. I heard years ago that the DEA has tens of thousands of employees and a virtual unlimited amount of money. <br />I think eventually the drug &#039;warrior&#039; will be seen for what they really are-craven power hungry people who make a living putting people in jail the rest of their lives for a natural desire to change consciousness.

				I am a morbidly curious person, so I was of course fascinated by the deep web upon hearing about its existence about one and a half years ago. I started studying how to access this, and of course TOR popped up. Went to probably the most famous deep web site then hidden wiki. Through there I ended up in places I&#039;d rather not talk of, and there was the drugs section. I&#039;ve smoked some weed and done my share of psychedelics, so I was interested in it. Stumbled upon this place.

				I stumbled across a reference to it on reddit.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a guide in a thread that I read somewhere one night when I was really high.&nbsp; All I could remember was that there was this website called the silk road where you supposedly buy drugs on the internet.&nbsp; So I started digging, learned about this Tor thing I heard about a few years ago (they are overthrowing the government over in the middle east with Tor).&nbsp; Researched, researched, researched... Lurking, lurking, lurking and then lurking some moar.<br /><br />Now I feel confident that I have got this thing down.&nbsp; Just made my first purchase the other day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Loving It.

				Obsession with LSD shortly after experimenting with shrooms. Looking for any information on the L I could find, I wasn&#039;t even looking for a place to buy it just reading information. Information upon information that I already read hundreds of times, anyways I stumbled upon a conversation about it and this place was mentioned and I did my homework and a lot of learning and before I knew it I was here. A place that I could only dream of being real, not the fact that you could buy drugs over the internet, any fool could guess that it has been going on since forever but a place with this much sophistication and sense of security. Sometimes I still have to pinch my self to make sure I&#039;m not dreaming.

				I&#039;m in two minds whether to tell friends about this place or not? My biggest worry is they might gossip and once it gets round people will start to know who my drop off guy is (ie. the local postman)&nbsp; and it only needs one wrong person to find that out. That&#039;s a far bigger worry for me than people tracing me buying coins or anything like that.<br /><br />Plus the friends whom I would tell all seem to have decent street connections for their drugs anyway. My one mate who&#039;d probably appreciate the vast selection of weed available on here already has serious hang ups about making online orders from the likes of eBay and Amazon nevermind for drugs.<br /><br />I grew my own weed for a few years and as a result had to train myself to operate in a life of secrecy so I guess some of that Is coming through here.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t even told my missus about it yet. She doesn&#039;t do drugs and is only a light drinker but tolerates my use. I know I can trust her, like I did when growing the weed, but my biggest fear about telling her is that she might begin to worry about packages coming in case there&#039;s ever a knock on the door. I don&#039;t see the point in causing worry when I don&#039;t have to. She asked me what was in one once and I just told her it was stuff from eBay.

				It was two months ago, I was procrastinating my time reading online news pages. Suddenly I stumbled upon an article about an &#039;amazon&#039; for drugs on a major German newspage. This article contained the two magical words &#039;silk road&#039;. Little more was needed for me to find this place.<br /><br />The next day they removed the name from the article but I wonder how many people they led here like me.<br /><br />I want to say thanks to DPR for making SR possible and improving my life in many ways!

				I heard about MOM&#039;s (mail order marijuana sites) 18 months ago but never ordered because I had cheaper street connections. I stumbled upon Topix four months before finding out about this place. Took a look at that site and, although I was intrigued, Topix just seemed like a dis-organised chaos full of scammers compared to SR. <br /><br />Having found those previous sites though I can&#039;t believe I never made more of a concerted effort to search for somwhere like this until that one day when I just saw somebody make a random comment about Silk Road on a You Tube vid<br /><br />Has anyone here used Topix before and what was your experience?

Before SR I&#039;d been about five years without taking my favorite party drug MDMA. Used to indulge every other weekend at one time but coupled with most of the clubs I went to closing down and my street sources drying up I&#039;d been without for it for quite some time.<br /><br />Then about a year ago I began getting into magic truffles. Truffles being a legal alternative to shrooms (in most countries outside USA) for anyone unaware and can be easily purchased online. They were OK. They enhanced the music and filled the void to a certain extent but I still missed my ecstasy.<br /><br />So, seemingly giving up finding an XTC source, I went on a bit of a fact finding mission to discover what other legal highs there was out there.<br /><br />I became particularly interested in peyote / mescaline. I&#039;d learnt that the high of this drug was somewhat similar to a cross between XTC and LSD. But that&#039;s as far as I got because one Sunday evening whilst browsing the comments of a meacaline vid on You Tube I suddenly saw someone mentioning this site so I checked it out and I&#039;m happy to say I&#039;ve not looked back since.<br /><br />I&#039;ve still got several sources for street weed but I mostly order that online now as well. You simply can&#039;t beat the wide variety of choice available here on SR. Plus I&#039;m living 10 miles outside town these days so traveling just to buy weed was always a pain. Especially the times when I used to go and nobody had any or they&#039;d keep you waiting an hour or so as they were expecting their drop off from the bigger dealer.<br /><br />This site really has been a god send. DPR you are a legend. Power to the people!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Fuck!&nbsp; It&#039;s in youtube comments now!?!?!?&nbsp; That&#039;s worse then where I found out about it.<br />I discovered it via a deepweb thread on 4chan.&nbsp; Does on one know the rules of Fight Club?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think you&#039;re a couple of years late to be invoking the whole &#039;Fight Club&#039; thing here.&nbsp; SR has been in mainstream media for a long time and that&#039;s how they like it.&nbsp; DPR was quite happy for me to do a mainstream feature on the Road.&nbsp; And last week Atlantis *tweeted* me asking me to do an article on them.&nbsp; It&#039;s not some super-sekrit cool underground club.&nbsp; It&#039;s a business. :)

				my friend introduced me to MDMA caps and pills. i had done coke before but only a few lines here and there.. nothing drastic. anyway i took 2 caps on a night out and i had never felt so happy and energetic, yet straight, in my whole life. i know a few people who could get them for me on a regular basis so i asked and the dealers said yeah sure.. next min they said no. i asked both for weeks and there were excuses that they had none or couldnt get in contact with their own dealer. i was left empty handed at another night out a few weeks later and decided to do some research.. i litterally googled how to buy drugs online and an article of SR came up. i called my friend and we figured it was a scam.. i got on a mission and found links and videos on how to access the road. took me a few good hours but i made it! then the bitcoins. they frustrated the fk out of me but i figured it out. now its easy done with orders coming in and coins in my wallet.. love the road. hope it stays up forever.. much better than street dealers and better quality..

				I heard about bitcoins shortly after they launched.&nbsp; I was very intrigued in the possibilities.&nbsp; Then I quickly heard about SR on some BTC related forum.<br /><br />I actually heard about SR well over a year before I finally visited for the first time.&nbsp; I created an account on my first visit and did my homework on the forums, and had it funded an purchased a few items within a week.<br /><br />Now it is a big part of my life!

				Funnily enough, I was reading up on the historical Silk Road on the ol&#039; free encyclopedia, and exploring the disambiguation list lead me to this here Silk Road. This was some months ago, I knew nothing about the Deep Web, but was quite serendipitous because I was getting sick of flakey acid leads. Here&#039;s hoping for a good experience or two.

				To be honest... I don&#039;t even remember. I probably read about it in an article or a 4chan thread or something about the &quot;Deep Web&quot;. That was before I was into drugs, but I set up Tor and created an account (which is now lost somewhere in the aether) out of curiosity, just to get a glimpse at how things work on an anonymous network. That was back when the Road was a bit more anything-goes, and people were freely trading in weapons and stolen goods in addition to the drugs and shit. Oh, and the &quot;Apparel&quot; section was like one guy selling custom-made t-shirts, not a whole bunch of people selling knock-off designer clothes.

				Heard of it on some forums a long time ago, but never interested because I wasn&#039;t into drugs. Recently tried MDMA and joined a local pill review forum, and one post mentioned &quot;SR&quot;, which I associated to this, bought a coin and now I&#039;m waiting for my stuff to come :)
