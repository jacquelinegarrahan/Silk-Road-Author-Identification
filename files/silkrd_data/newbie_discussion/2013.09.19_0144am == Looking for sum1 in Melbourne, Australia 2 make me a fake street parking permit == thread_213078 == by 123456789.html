				Hi all. <br /><br />I, personally, am currently unable to get a street parking permit in the Yarry City Council in Melbourne due to some bullshit new parking restrictions, and thus I literally have no where to keep my car.<br /><br />Just wondering if there&#039;s anyone out there who has the ability to make me a legit-looking fake parking permit. <br /><br />I have thought about ways of doing it myself (i.e. take a photo of another local resident&#039;s permit through their windscreen - as it is one of those permits that sticks to the inside of the windscreen - and then photoshop it to put my car&#039;s registration number on it and a different permit number, then get it printed as a sticker that sticks from the front), but I don&#039;t have much confidence in my ability to do this. Also the permits have a hologram on them, which proved to be an issue with the photos I took, mostly due to reflection on the windscreen, or the flash from the camera.<br /><br />In terms of getting busted, I don&#039;t think the permit inspectors would actually check every permit. I think they would just quickly gaze over it to check it looks legit, then move on. But I&#039;m not certain about that. Either way, it&#039;s a risk im willing to take. i dont really have any options anyway.<br /><br />Anyways, if anyone out there has the ability to help me with this, please PM me and let me know how much you would charge. <br /><br />Thanks
