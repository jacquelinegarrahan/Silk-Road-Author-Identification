				I know you can&#039;t be completely sure, but what is the likelihood that LE would bother with a CD and warrant if I&#039;m ordering small personal amounts of psychedelics like LSD or shrooms with maybe some DMT, weed, or ecstasy? I would think with all the manpower and money it would take they wouldn&#039;t find it worth doing so for such small amounts. Any advice&gt;

				Unless you live in Texas or some jack shit hick town where LE has nothing better to do, it won&#039;t happen. All you would need to do if it did happen was deny you had anything to with it.

				Is your ass all roomy since that&#039;s most likely where you got that number from? Haha,Thanks though, I&#039;m just extra cautious because I&#039;ve always been told to never get in trouble with LE because one&#039;s record is permanent.
