				With your excellent grammar and writing skills you should be able to convince vendors to give.you drugs for reviews.<br /><br />It also shouldn&#039;t be hard to find bitcoins for lower than market rate. I see them advertised by spammers all the time. <br /><br />The only real way to get free btc that I know of is.btc fountains. You can earn several cents a day!<br /><br />Cheers.<br />I see u

				No one is gonna just give u bitcoins of a large amount for nothing.. yeah its very possible to get samples. but u need to be a long time member, well known respected. actually know about drugs. whats good and whats not. be able to write a review ,an first u have to know how to spell..(lol)&nbsp; U wont find a cheaper bitcoin, what ever the price is on the btc market is how much your gonna pay.. U need to have a certain amount of purchases, over 10 at least 500 spent be a hero member. You can some times find new vendor who offer free samples for review in product offers. Other than that you have not been here long enough or have what most big time dealer look for in a reviewer. <br /><br />Iv been here over a year over 70 buys, perfect stats over 7000 bucks spent. Iv gotton Free Heroin, Benzos , Iv won Lotto&#039;s 3.5 grams of coke. Xtc, LSD A OUNCE OF WEED.&nbsp; All kinda shit. But im a long time respected member. For now you need to keep lookin in the product offers, thats your best bet. I highly doubt at this point any vendor will give u anything for free.<br /><br />If i get a free sample of something, its to see if i like the quality and to possibly do further business with the vendor. But i pay for shipping when i am offered a sample. Just being truthful so dont take it as im being a dick..

				You could try the product offers but you really need to be a long time member with good grammer and ask a vendor VERY nicely. I wouldn&#039;t count on it though...
