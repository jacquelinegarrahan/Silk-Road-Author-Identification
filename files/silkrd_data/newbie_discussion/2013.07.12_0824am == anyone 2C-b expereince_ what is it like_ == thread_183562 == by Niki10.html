				Hello fellows!<br /><br />there is quite a similar question in Drug Safety, but I need 50 posts to ask there my questions&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I read on the clearnet some information but it looks like everywhere it is a bit different, also what concerns the dosage.<br />So I decided I ask directly people who may have expereince with it<br /><br />what is it like? do I need a sitter like with lsd when first time? any come down after it? not able to sleep? <br /><br />Could you also provide a dosage, please, let say for the first time home alone for example. and in general I would love to know a good dosage for a good trip, but not too good (bad trip&nbsp; :o)<br /><br />wikipedia based on Shulgin expereince says different dosage for different states of mind: mild, average, high, overdose&nbsp; :o and so on<br /><br />I just read on clearnet some reports and sometimes people overdosed and had a bad trip. I never had a bad trip after LSD and I do need it after 2C-b.<br /><br />Other question is what other 2C-family products are worth trying? 2C-e, 2C-i? other ideas?<br />again, opinions are different but I am happy to hear any of your expereince<br /><br />Peace brothers!

				2CB was awesome. for me atleast. <br /><br />it had a lot of euphoric rushes much like MDMA. with visual distortions i relate to LSD<br />I wouldnt say you need a sitter on 2CB. but a couple friends to do it with would be best. <br /><br />Sometimes the &quot;comeup&quot; on 2cb can be a little rough in my experience. but once im past that its off to the dancefloor!

				I wouldn&#039;t say you need a &#039;sitter&#039; on ANY drug unless you&#039;re inexperienced regarding drugs as a whole. Unless perhaps the person in question is somehow mentally deficit.

				2cb is highly visual and not very mentally trippy compared to other 2c chemicals (like 2ce is more a headfuck too). Extremely relaxed. I started with 20mg that was awesome. 35mg has me shutting my eyes and flying over fractal mountains of in-describable beauty. My mate even tried 50mg and could barely move for hours like on DMT, dosages that high are highly inadvisable unless you work up to them first however.

I heard people say it is a good combination. any expereince?<br /><br />Peace

				In my experience, 2C-B is very similar to acid, but lasting only a third of the time and with more body load.&nbsp; I enjoy it quite a bit, though I usually need to take antacids on it to soothe my stomach.&nbsp; Dosage is small (18-28mg) and even a 1mg difference can significantly change the intensity of your experience.&nbsp; I do find it difficult to go to sleep afterward.&nbsp; I usually just try to start the trip early enough in the evening that insomnia won&#039;t be a problem, but if it is melatonin or a benzo will help me get to sleep.<br /><br />I tried 2C-E once and found it an interesting experience, but not one I&#039;d necessarily want to have again.&nbsp; Instead of the euphoria of LSD, mushrooms or 2C-B, it made me feel emotionless and robotic.&nbsp; Other than that, it was similar to 2C-B in the visual and physical sense.

				I tried for first time the other weekend, toook about 25mg of powder for a strong does, the pain of snorting is the worst I have ever had and burned for at least 15mins, leading to a slightly uncomfortable coming up phase, I felt quite sick due to the nose/throat pain. <br />Once I came up it was like a mushroom-ish visuals with a mild MDMA euphoria, very pleasant although after an hour or so I felt quite sleepy. The visuals were perhaps a little less natural and more geometric looking then shrooms or acid.<br />It was quite clear-headed on the whole and me and most of my mates spent all evening with the psychedelic giggles.<br />All in all it was pleasant and when combined with some K it blew me away, literally. Not something I urge to do again quickly but certainly a worthwhile drug which i will probably do again sometime when the mood is right.

				For me 20mg worked perfectly. I went to see a concert and it was an overwhelming experience for all my senses. That&#039;s how I&#039;d describe it: fully enhancement of the senses. It&#039;s true what they say about it&#039;s like MDMA and LSD would have had a son, but at the same time with its own character. I felt how the intermediary between the music and the soul was completely erased, being at the same time in that psychedelic space where lights and colors are glowing and morphing and time and space exist no more. It also gave me a great mental clarity, and I had a couple of ideas that I wrote down and I&#039;ll use for my work. At the same time, that lucidity stayed within: it was really difficult for me to communicate my thoughts, instead of that I&#039;d find myself laughing hard all the time. A couple of hours after the peak it all started to fade gently. I fell asleep easily and woke up next day with no hangover at all.

				Well, here&#039;s my trip report from about 25mg of GrandWizard&#039;s 2C-B:<br /><br />June 1st 2013<br />I saw fractals when I closed my eyes. I had the ability to physically melt with external objects. I had absolutely no sense of time. I had no physical body because it became one with everything. The phenomenal world and my mental states were totally malleable and in my control.&nbsp;I said at one point &quot;I&#039;ve never felt so powerful in my life&quot;.&nbsp;I realized that my consciousness gives birth to the world and in a way I&#039;m totally in charge of the phenomenal experience. I walked over to a grip and did a one-arm pull up with each arm...I cannot do that sober, not even close. Today my bicep fuckin hurts, I pushed my arm beyond it&#039;s physical capacity!<br /><br />I feel like I don&#039;t need to do psychedelics for many years. I&#039;m set. It&#039;s time to work on and focus my energy into this life game. But anyways, at one point I was standing knee deep in the ocean and the biggest revelation of my entire lift smacked me in the face. It felt like one of those religious moments that converts or prophets speak of. <br /><br />There&#039;s this great essay Schopenhauer wrote about free will and our lack of it in the phenomenal world. He said that in a transcendent way we do have free will in the world of noumena (Will as thing-in-itself) but that it doesn&#039;t act on the world of phenomena...something like that. So when I was tripping it made perfect sense that the future was already written and this whole soup of twirling phenomena was fated. But what I was really curious about was noumena...whether or not it&#039;s divine. What I realized in the water is that there&#039;s no objective answer and that it was totally up to me to create that reality. Like it&#039;s not objectively true that god does or doesn&#039;t exist, I have the power to create him. I had this limited sense of transcendental free will and the&nbsp;only fucking possible choice in life to be made was whether or not to believe noumena is divine. Simple. A leap of faith, an affirmation, &quot;God&quot; as a choice not a fact. As soon as I made the affirmative choice I was fuckin overwhelmed with divine beauty, it was unreal, so perfect. <br /><br />God is a subject not an object…we are that subject, we are gods, and we have the power to create divinity as a subject realizing it&#039;s own godhood. <br /><br />I realized my ancestors are always present, always at a distance but must be recognized and accepted. I realize the way to clean up California&#039;s coastline is to find hippies and give them drugs and trash bags. We bathed in the sea and Pink Floyd&#039;s The Wall timed out to everything. Synchronisity. <br />
