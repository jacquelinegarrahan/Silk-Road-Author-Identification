				The only good I could possibly see is if it&#039;s some sort of SR version of the Gideon water test, in a way, seeing who will resort to pointless and redundant posts to get their +50. I imagine regardless of the intent those who spam too much won&#039;t fare well on karma :/

				Having been using the forums for a bit before coming here (I haven&#039;t really needed to post anything), I think that the main reason for this rule is to keep people from creating accounts for the sole purpose of fake reviews, flaming enemies/competitors, etc. It would seem to me that this is going to be a way to filter through and try to keep the accounts more &quot;real&quot; so that the information posted can hopefully be more reliable.

				I agree. The whole newbie section is just spam. Aaaand since the only way you can get to 50 posts is by posting in the newbie section, you are pretty much forced to partake in the spam.

				Good point about haters, but this newbie section is turning out to be lame. I&#039;m here to do my research and see if it is a viable option for my &quot;girls&quot; to go to work. Charge a &quot;bond&quot; just like the vendors have to in the SR market to keep the riff raff out. I&#039;m here for business not senseless jibber jabber.

				While it&#039;s true that it takes a bit of effort to reach the 50 post mark, I think that filling your posts with spam could be counter-productive. For instance, if I were to read a review that someone posted about blow and was concerned about the depth of characters of one of the prominent reviewers, I might check out some of the 50 posts that were made in the newbie section. If all 50 were spam, and the only real post was a promotion of a product that would cost me dearly... well, enough said. Anyway, I&#039;m new here, so just some thoughts. Peace

				One of the downfalls I have found of this 50 post newbie section is that some vendors who will come onto the forums and engage in a dichotomy with their customers can no longer do this if they don&#039;t have a high post count. It is unfortunate that this is blocking out some less-active-on-forums vendors from practicing good customer service!

				It makes sense to me because SR needs to be more secure as a community, as opposed to more open. I think it&#039;s good to have a certain stability shown by people. And the good vendors spend time in the forums anyway, keeping up with their customers&#039; reviews and answering concerns. At least, that&#039;s what it&#039;s looked like to me.

				Well, here we have a case in point. A user going by the name &quot;Fuck DPR&quot; is spamming the newbie section with FUD.<br /><br />The established members in the main section of the forum don&#039;t have to be bothered by him yet thanks to this rule. And what&#039;s nice is that he could be banned before reaching 50 posts and have to start all over again. <br /><br />It&#039;s a PITA for new members, but there have been some scammers of the bitcoin exchange variety that have virtually robbed a number of members due to their incessant spamming of the main section. People fell for the scam because it seemed an easier and more convenient way to obtain bitcoins rather than the other methods like BitInstant&gt;MoneyGram&gt;BTC wallet&gt;SR wallet.&nbsp;

				I have been here a while and the night before they introduced this I wiped my account, I do this from time to time because you know people are watching and sometimes when I rage on meth I talk to much shit.<br /><br />It&#039;s great.. but then paranoia hits me and I think fuck this shit, bang bang wipe wipe everything. hah.<br /><br />Then I laugh. I go HA HA HA. I think I could spam my way again to 50, but why bother. I don&#039;t see myself going anywhere. Maybe this is a pointless post, but I believe overtime I could make my way to 50 again in no time by posting quality posts. But then I think to myself back in the day, all I needed was some meth from the Milkman, then BAM. I will have 50 posts, I&#039;m sure within 10 minutes.<br /><br />Hey maybe next week it will be on.. and on and on and on we go.<br /><br />Maybe the rule was introduced just to cut out spam bots, dont know if it has worked the admins will have to chime in. However spammers are always finding bugs in forum software anyway -- so the programmers behind the forum software will have to make adjustments all the time.<br /><br />ABC

				I will still use this forum the same way by cross checking facts and references. this does not change the fact that people lie, now they gotta lie 50 times.

				This will create a whole generation of roadsters that don&#039;t contribute. I hate posting shit for nothing, makes me feel diluted. <br />yea Kim42r9k I know what you mean, but just showing stats for a user name would not be a security issue. just numbers not personal info of what they purchased, alot of people do it already.

				I had already made 10 post in the regular forum before they made this rule. It should have been new accounts not peeps with less than 50 that been here a while.I guess i just keep bitch posting till i get to 50 since there are no real treads in this forum.
