				I&#039;m no stranger to the world of psychedelics, but I&#039;m too old for the bullshit I used to have to pull as a kid to get them. I heard about Silk Road awhile ago, and figured, &quot;Well, if it&#039;s all a scam, I&#039;ve wasted far more money in my past. At worst, I&#039;ll lose a bit more.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m no stranger to the wonderful world of scams though. One thing I tell everyone when making any sort of purchase, online or off, is to do your research before hand. Look at feed back. Read comments. Visit forums. Gain as much information as you can before hand, and read about mistakes others have made. One of the vendors I was looking into was &quot;MarijuanaIsMyMuse&quot;. They seemed to have pretty decent feedback on the road, but I decided to check the Silk Road subreddit as well. I found a few people bitching about the quality of their mdma crystals, and a few people saying the complete opposite. The common theme though was that everyone got their package, and that the stuff was always legit. (Except for one or two posts I saw, but usually when I read reviews I try to discount the bottom worst experiences as well as the top best ones.)<br /><br />I order a few of the &quot;Green CK&quot; mdma tabs from MarijuanaIsMyMuse. I recognized the pill, but I hadn&#039;t seen in in a few years. I looked it up online, and found a recent testing that said it was pure from an area which made sense in terms of where the vendor claims to ship from. <br /><br />So, I transferred my bitcoins (which were worth 60 bucks a coin two weeks ago!) and sat back.<br /><br />Shipping took a little longer than I expected it to, but that&#039;s only because it was over Easter weekend, where the entire damn country pretty much shuts down for four days. So if I knock off those four days, I&#039;d say it was pretty par for the course. <br /><br />The packaging was fantastic. I won&#039;t go into any detail, but it let me know that I wasn&#039;t buying from some 17 year old who lives in his mother&#039;s basement. <br /><br />And how was the product you may ask? Well, right now my body feels weightless, and all I can think about is climbing around a jungle gym at a park. In fact, I may just go and do that after I finish writing this. Suffice it to say, it&#039;s every bit as good as I would expect it to be.<br /><br />So I&#039;d just like to say thank you to Silk Road, and to MarijuanaIsMyMuse for offering a much needed service to the community. I&#039;ve always thought it was brassiness that in a &quot;free&quot; country, I&#039;m not allowed to put certain things into my body. <br /><br />In conclusion, I&#039;ll leave you with the role I played in making this a successful exchange:<br /><br />1.) Always do research before making a purchase, ESPECIALLY in a situation like this. Read comments, read reviews, read feedback. But read them all, not just a few. Don&#039;t let one person&#039;s bad experience sour your perceptions of the vendor, yet at the same time, don&#039;t let other people&#039;s good experiences be the deciding factor in your purchase.<br /><br />2.) With any drug you do, always, always, ALWAYS make sure that you have done everything in your power to identify exactly what it is, and how it will affect you. There are many sites on the internet that analyze the chemicals found in various drugs, mdma being but one, and I cannot stress enough that when it comes to taking a pill, you need to know what is in that pill from a reputable source before you even think of taking it. When you hear about people ODing in things like MDMA, it&#039;s either because they didn&#039;t know that something bad was in it, or they were being completely irresponsible in how much they were taking. Psychedelics and ecstasy are incredibly powerful tools, and like any tool, there are certain things you need to do to ensure your safety. It&#039;s no different than learning about safety and first aid before you go to work on a construction site. Make sure you have the right tool for the job, and be responsible in how you use it.<br /><br />3.) MarijuanaIsMyMuse was one of the few vendors I saw that didn&#039;t require a noob like me to finalize early. Never finalize early. Once when I was a teen, I gave someone I knew 100 bucks to get some Ecstasy for me. He hopped in his car, and said he&#039;d be back in half an hour. Never heard from him again. Never, never, EVER give someone money until they&#039;ve given you the product. I don&#039;t care how many people in the feedback section say to finalize early. Don&#039;t do it. I don&#039;t care if a vedor has made 1000 sales, have 100% positive feed back, and has almost everyone finalize early. Never finalize early.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what you can do though. If a vendor has tons of positive feedback, and everyone they sell to finalizes early, you might be worried that if you don&#039;t, they wont send the product, or they&#039;ll cancel the order, or just generally be suspicious of you. So, after you place your order, simply send the vendor a message. I messaged MarijuanaIsMyMuse right after I ordered, and basically said to them &quot;It&#039;s my first time on the road, and you had some decent reviews, so I think I&#039;ll give you a try. I don&#039;t feel comfortable finalizing early though. I know you&#039;re probably one of the more reputable vendors on here, but it&#039;s just sort of my own general code of conduct to only exchange the money when the good have been delivered. And hey, if they are, and they&#039;re good, of course I&#039;ll finalize. I&#039;m sure you want to avoid getting scammed just as much as I do. So when my package finally arrives, I&#039;ll finalize, and then post a few places recommending you as being legit. If you&#039;re a good vendor, and I have a good experience, than I want to do what little I can to ensure that enough people continue to buy from you that you&#039;ll stick around for awhile&quot;. <br /><br />Messages like that really go a long way in situations like these. If you humanize yourself a little bit, and you&#039;re polite and well spoken, the vendor will be less likely to think you&#039;re some shady fuck who wants to order some drugs and then not pay for them.<br /><br />4:) Always leave positive feedback if you had a positive experience. And I don&#039;t just mean clicking 5/5 and writing &quot;will buy again.&quot; Take the time to post somewhere and let others know that &quot;Hey, this guy over here is legit. I had a god experience. You should buy from him and support him.&quot;<br /><br />5.) Lastly, don&#039;t be a fucking douchebag. If you get your goods, don&#039;t try to cheat the system to avoid paying. Pay your damn money like you agreed to. And if the stuff you get is crap, say so, but don&#039;t be a douchebag about it. &quot;Aw man that stuff was so fucking weak! That guy is a complete fucking con artist!&quot; If you didn&#039;t like the stuff, you can say so in a way that will give others out there proper information. Maybe you party a lot, and the tab you took just wasn&#039;t even close to enough for you. But to someone else who rarely does it, it may be more than plenty. Take the time to describe the experience, and explain why it disappointed you. &quot;The listing sad it was for 1g of pure MDMA crystals, but when I weighed it out, it was actually a little less. I&#039;m not certain it was pure either, because it didn&#039;t give me nearly the same roll as I usually get with pure. That is useful information to people. Saying &quot;That guy&#039;s shit fucking sucks&quot; may be true, but that&#039;s not really enough to go on when other people have said they have had good experiences.<br /><br />Anyways, just thought I&#039;d leave this here for my first post. My first experience buying from MarijuanaIsMyMuse was a good one, and the tabs I ordered are most CERTAINLY real. ;)<br />

				I can already tell you&#039;re on some good Molly, because this review is huge, and very enthusiastic :D Good review though<br /><br />The best way to find good vendors, and trustworthy vendors, is through the Avengers... MDMA Avengers have a good list of vendors that have had MONSTROUS success, with a miniscule failure rate.<br /><br />MarijuanaIsMyMuse was actually on the Avengers&#039; shit-list, as they seemed dodgy and a lot of people were complaining on either no-shows or just shitty product. People are urged to take into account their own tolerance and the environment in which they take the drugs - For instance, if they are already fucked up on crack and weed, taking MDMA mightn&#039;t do a damn thing - and the reviews still seemed to be panned out for a negative result...<br /><br />However, reviews such as yours still pop up about them every now and again, and you seem to be lucky, good for you :)<br /><br />Also, @StateProp,<br /><br />Great vendors for MDMA:<br /><br />JesusofRave<br />3Jane<br />Subtickle<br /><br />My personal favourite top 3<br /><br />Just check the top sellers list, and research them in the forums... Obviously not right now,as SR is down for maintenance, but when it&#039;s back up, just look up top sellers in the forums.<br /><br />GL.

				This is a great review. It&#039;s too bad it&#039;s just a thread in the newbie forum and not in an actual feedback thread.
