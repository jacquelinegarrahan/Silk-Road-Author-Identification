				Never in my life could I have imaged what DMT has begun to show me.... I would like to personally thank JOR and BLIM for the beautiful DMT extract freebase they have offered just recently.<br /><br />The first day I was able to get some into my body I was so uneasy.... I thought my heart was going to explode out of my chest... it felt like it was beating a thousand times a minute... I thought I was going to DIE!&nbsp; I really did and had to make the decision if I wanted to go then or not!<br /><br />I had the extreme idea that if I wanted to I would be able to blast off into the universe with just another toke on my layered with cannabis ash DMT pipe....&nbsp; I made the deliberate decision to stop and hold off for a little bit... I really wanted to go to that place and other level but did not want to force it.... I wanted to walk through the gate not run..... little did I know.......<br /><br />It was not long before I was back at it..&nbsp; ( NEXT DAY ) I put some more DMT in my old mans pipe... ran the lighter across the top real quick to melt it onto the ash..... waited a minute and then....<br /><br />Oh...........my..........fucking..........GOD!!!!&nbsp; How is this even possible?&nbsp; How could I even be in this place at all...... I thanked whoever had led me to this place over and over...... sitting in the lotus position I felt myself vibrating with electric energy through every part of my body..... I had the VERY real auditory distortion of sound that I have never heard before......&nbsp; of course I have heard sound distortions before and the fusing of one sense with another but THIS was VERY VERY different......&nbsp; <br /><br />The high pitch ringing, vibrating in my ears, head.... it sounded like a very high tech engine that was going faster and faster..... spinning over and over.... faster and faster...... quicker.....&nbsp; and then............BAM............ and I do mean BAM! with all capital letters.<br /><br />The good and bad, the pro and con, the in and out..... the GEOMETRIC PATTERN OVER EVERYTHING!&nbsp; &nbsp; It was like taking 1,000 hits of very potent acid......<br /><br />On another toke of DMT it had my mind just reeling...... I had to actually get off the chair I was on and sit on the ground.... fuck man if someone had seen me I think it would have looked like I was fucking fried and I was!..............BUT only for the 5 or 7 min. it lasted......<br /><br />I have used the DMT a number of times since I got it..... I am always kind of nervous before I use it.... It has the feeling of the unknown for sure....... a thing of beauty and a thing of the unknown.&nbsp; Something to be treated with respect for sure.... not your everyday let&#039;s go get stoned kind of thing.... be warned.<br /><br />Thank you SR for being here...... I really don&#039;t know if I would have ever come across this absolutely interesting substance if you were not here......<br /><br />For anyone who want&#039;s or need&#039;s a wake up call.............&nbsp; DMT just might be it......<br /><br />mm<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				@glug..... hence the title first steps<br /><br />@tree..... layered in a tobacco pipe with cannabis then dmt then cannabis ash.... I ran the lighter over the top of the dmt to melt it a little bit.....from what I gather you need to vaporize the substance and not burn it although I think you will still feel effects if it does burn...

				Oh I thought you could only use something like a meth pipe for DMT, it&#039;s probably more practical since the flame doesn&#039;t touch the thing that&#039;s inside it.. It&#039;s good to know you can use a normal pipe as well.
