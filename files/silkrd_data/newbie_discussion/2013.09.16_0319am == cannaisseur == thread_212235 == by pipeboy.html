				I also ordered his &quot;C&quot; sample. I don&#039;t know what to believe, it seems every vendor has people who love and hate. Bottom line is it was only $25 and the stuff on the street here is shit. I&#039;ll update if/ when it comes.

				UPDATE: received my sample yesterday. It took a full week to arrive but I can say I am pleased with it. Stealth and packaging are top notch. Gear is good value for money.
